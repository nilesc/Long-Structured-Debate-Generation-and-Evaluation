Discussion Title: Should European Monarchies Be Abolished?

1. European monarchies should be abolished.
1.1. Pro: Monarchy is costly.
1.1.1. Con: Monarchies often bring in more revenue than they expend.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Royalists [support](http://royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/royal-events-to-look-forward-to-in-2017-73548) the monarchy to such an extent that they take pleasure in following the lives of the royals. They are interested in royal births, the health of the royal family and the day to day lives of the royals.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: [80% of the British](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1383684/Monarchy-out-of-touch-with-people.html) public said they enjoy reading stories about the monarchy 'only a little' or 'not at all'.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Monarchy is an unnecessary distraction and cost when so many people are struggling and there are important issues going unreported while the media focus on the inanities of royalty.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: This interest means that there are royal reporters whose job is to comment and speculate on the royal family in the media.
1.1.1.2. Con: Tourists are attracted to the history of monarchy and royal palaces, regardless of the political structure of the state \(i.e. republic or constitutional monarchy\).
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Versailles in republican France is in the world’s top 50 tourist destinations and receives more than six million visitors a year. In contrast, Buckingham Palace in Britain receives [much fewer](http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/most-visited-castles-palaces/index.html) visitors.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The amount of people who purchase tickets to visit individual royal buildings does not reflect the number of people who will visit a country for its royal buildings as a whole. For instance, [49% of overseas tourists](http://files.londonandpartners.com/l-and-p/assets/our-insight-londons-cultural-tourists.pdf) to London visited Buckingham Palace, despite not buying a ticket to go into the palace itself.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: It is possible to preserve the cultural and historic value of something without continuing the institution.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: The [Tower of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London) has a preserved cultural and historic value as a museum, but nobody would seriously suggest it should still be used as a form of imprisonment.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: People may be considerably more interested in visiting palaces if they could see areas currently off limits such as the Queen's living areas and private collections.
1.1.1.2.4. Con: It's not the history alone that attracts tourists. The celebrity status of current monarchs attracts tourists.
1.1.1.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.1.1.2.4.2. Pro: The British monarchy has become a [global brand](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/10/british-royal-monarchy-queen-elizabeth/411388/) and has an estimated value of around[$84 billion](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-royals-brand-idUSKCN0XI2BC).
1.1.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: The so-called 'Kate effect', whereby items of clothing worn by the Duchess of Cambridge sell-out, is estimated to be worth [over £1 billion.](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/16/fashion-diplomacy-kate-effect-is-alive-and-well)
1.1.1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Critics claim that the 'Kate effect' is [overstated](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/9783789/The-Kate-Effect-overstated-due-to-Duchesss-thriftiness.html), suggesting items worn by the princess sell out merely because they are old items.
1.1.1.2.4.2.1.2. Pro: British companies such as LK Bennett, Reiss and Issa, have [expanded to the US](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/30/kate-duchess-of-cambridge-fashion-lk-bennett) after the Duchess of Cambridge wore some of their items, thanks to the international exposure it offered them.
1.1.1.2.4.2.2. Pro: There is frequent [commentary](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/05/world/europe/rainbow-queen-outfits/index.html) on the range of coloured outfits that Queen Elizabeth wears.
1.1.1.2.4.2.3. Pro: In a survey with high and middle-income Chinese consumers, a royal connection to the British monarchy was cited as one of the [top four factors](https://theconversation.com/three-reasons-why-chinese-consumers-love-the-queen-and-why-britain-should-too-47182) in their luxury purchasing decision.
1.1.1.2.4.3. Pro: Events like royal weddings significantly [boost the economy](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/07/is-the-british-royal-family-worth-the-money/278052/).
1.1.1.2.4.3.1. Pro: The British media reported that the [revenue](https://www.thomaswhite.com/world-markets/the-u-k-royal-wedding-a-mixed-bag-for-the-economy/) generated by Prince William and Catherine Middleton's wedding in 2011 ranged from £1 billion to £2 billion through retail spending, tourism, and pub sales.
1.1.1.2.4.3.1.1. Con: The public holiday on the royal wedding day caused a loss of [£6 billion](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/29/royal-wedding-tourism-boost) to the economy in terms of output and revenue losses. The gains from the royal wedding are therefore worth just a third of the losses.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Monarchies generate large amounts of tourism income.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: The Royal Family of the UK brings in [£500 million](https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/649397/one-is-worth-45bn/) a year in extra tourism and sales.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.2.1.
1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: It is estimated that Prince George provided a [$368 million](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/birth-royal-daughter-brings-economic-boost-article-1.2209178) boost to the British economy in the nine weeks after his birth in 2013.
1.1.1.3.1.3. Con: The [UK’s tourism body VisitBritain](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/the-biggest-myth-about-the-queen-her-contribution-to-the-british-economy-10491277.html) states that while international tourism is Britain’s third largest service export, with inbound tourism to Britain worth £26.2 billion, only some of that figure can be attributed to attractions and events with a connection to British monarchs and heritage.
1.1.1.3.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.3.1.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.1.1.3.3. Con: Valuation agency Brand Finance has [concluded](http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-queen-and-the-uk-royal-family-contribution-to-the-uk-economy-2015-9) that the economic worth the British monarchy brings through tourism and sales is cancelled out by their cost.
1.1.1.3.3.1. Con: The UK royal family's overall value, including the Crown Estate and Royal Collection, was [estimated](http://brandfinance.com/images/upload/brand_finance_s_valuation_of_the_british_monarchy_2015_full_details.pdf) by Brand Finance to be just under £57 billion in 2015, which far outweighs the overall costs of maintaining the monarchy.
1.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.3.
1.1.1.5. Pro: The UKs Crown Estate brought in [£330 million](https://fullfact.org/economy/royal-family-what-are-costs-and-benefits/) in 2016/17, and the government kept 75%.
1.1.1.6. Pro: The UK saves [millions of pounds](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/the-crown-estate-long-to-reign-over-the-property-market-10340876.html) each year because the Royal Family voluntarily surrenders revenue from royal lands to Parliament.
1.1.1.6.1. Con: If that land was publicly owned instead of part of the Crown Estate, those revenues would already be available to Parliament.
1.1.1.6.1.1. Con: Seizing the land, while no doubt profitable, would be illegal.
1.1.1.6.1.1.1. Con: Abolishing the monarchy would itself be illegal; the discussion already presupposes a change in the law.
1.1.1.6.2. Con: The revenues from the Crown Estate given to the Government are a [historical](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/the-crown-estate-long-to-reign-over-the-property-market-10340876.html) trade-off that former King George III established: in exchange for an income, the monarch offered the government the management of royal land.
1.1.1.6.3. Pro: The UK Crown typically brings in more [money](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36643314) via the Crown Estates than is granted by the Sovereign [Grant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Grant_Act_2011).
1.1.1.6.3.1. Pro: Only [15%](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/24/queen-elizabeth-commerical-property-empire-worth-11bn) of the Crown Estate is devoted to the monarchy.
1.1.1.6.4. Con: [Aristocrats](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/aristocrats-own-third-of-land-in-england-and-wales-2130392.html) \(hereditary [peers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_peer) or landed [gentry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landed_gentry)\) still own a third of land in England and Wales. The country’s largest individual landowners are the the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, the Duke of Atholls and the Prince of Wales.
1.1.1.6.5. Pro: An additional source [states](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/8627800/More-than-ever-the-Royal-Family-is-worth-every-penny.html) as of 2011 a £230.9 million income from the Crown Estate, against £32.1 million Royal Household expenditure.
1.1.1.7. Pro: Monarchs can also have a [positive effect](http://fortune.com/2013/04/30/the-business-case-for-monarchies/) on business and trade relationships.
1.1.1.7.1. Pro: Political instability can hurt economic growth.
1.1.1.7.1.1. Pro: Governments come and go but the monarchy remains constant. The continuity a sovereign brings to their country ensures stability through a single figure.
1.1.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Although their power is largely symbolic, in a constitutional monarchy, should the democratically elected government falter badly, the monarchy or its designate acts as an enduring and ostensibly incorruptible backstop until a new government can be formed.
1.1.1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Although monarchs have the power, in practice they are not the people who intervene in the case of a failing government. [In constitutional monarchies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/23/shut-up-royal-baby-haters-monarchy-is-awesome/), more often that not, new elections are called in the event of a failing government whereas in republics, it is often the president that takes on the ability to dissolve a government by choosing a non-electoral replacement.
1.1.1.7.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the event of a failing government, early elections are twice as common in constitutional monarchies than in republics with elected presidents, where 49% of the time they are dealt with via [cabinet reshuffling instead.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/23/shut-up-royal-baby-haters-monarchy-is-awesome/)
1.1.1.7.1.1.2. Pro: The monarch represents a constant link to the past. Their [consistency](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/opinion/why-the-queen-matters.html?mcubz=0) across multiple governments and plentiful reform creates a constant tie to the past, without blocking progression. In this way their connection to the past is positive.
1.1.1.7.1.1.2.1. Pro: This certainty is a comfort to conservatives meaning that they do not feel ostracised from the developments of national politics.
1.1.1.7.1.1.2.2. Pro: The respect that the monarch's position garnered from conservatives meant that in the UK, support shown by the monarch for movement away from colonialism gave the nation[self assurance](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/opinion/why-the-queen-matters.html?mcubz=0) to move away from a colonial past.
1.1.1.7.1.1.3. Pro: Monarchy provides opportunity for psychologically deeply positive rituals, such as coronation ceremony and national celebration thereof, which can heal wounds by lasting experience of equality and unity - social bonds are necessary for practical solidarity.
1.1.1.7.1.1.3.1. Pro: Opposed to that, presidential elections, with the usual aggressive moribund negative campaign, are often exercises in hate. Such campaigns can harm mutual cooperation and help within society.
1.1.1.7.1.1.3.2. Con: Those rituals are only positive and able to provide unity if all citizens believe in a democratic monarchy as the preferred way for their state. If not, those celebrations can be as divisive as partisan politics.
1.1.1.7.1.1.4. Con: At times, a radical shift in politics is required to create a more egalitarian and prosperous society.
1.1.1.7.1.1.4.1. Con: Many members of society are born into wealth they did not earn, we have to accept that all births are not equal. A true egalitarian society would be very unlikely to exist.
1.1.1.7.1.1.4.2. Pro: In the United States, the [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War), and [massive social disruption following the war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era), was [necessary to abolish slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) and attempt to create a [more egalitarian society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1866) [without race discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution).
1.1.1.7.1.1.5. Pro: Constitutional monarchy is an effective system of government as it avoids the requirement of republics to appoint a President or leader on a regular cycle.
1.1.1.7.1.1.5.1. Pro: Politicians can be short-sighted because a government’s term is limited. Monarchs tend to be more oriented towards the long term as compared to the Parliament since they rule for a longer period of time.
1.1.1.7.1.1.5.2. Pro: [The additional presidential](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/23/shut-up-royal-baby-haters-monarchy-is-awesome/) election decreases voter turnout by 7%, due to voter fatigue. As such, government elections become less representative in republics than those in countries with non-elected heads of state.
1.1.1.7.1.1.5.2.1. Con: This is a logical fallacy. Even if the turnout of voters is decreased, the elected official is still more representative than an unelected, hereditary head of state. The latter simply cannot be representative of the nation, in a democratic way. He can only be accepted or popular, but to be representative, the question \(election\) would have to be asked.
1.1.1.7.1.1.5.3. Con: Efficiency through avoiding elections is not a good argument for monarchy. Other regimes have been "effective" and avoided the requirement of republics to elect officials, such as the Soviet Union under Stalin and Mussolini's fascist Italy. However, few would say that we should implement such systems today.
1.1.1.7.1.1.5.4. Con: The efficient systematic use of time and money in a constitutional monarchy does not necessarily translate to an effective form of government \(generally qualified according to the quality of public services, welfare and democratic freedoms\), the latter of which should take priority.
1.1.1.7.1.1.5.5. Pro: As monarchs have a far longer mandate than republic presidents or prime ministers, it is easier for monarchs to establish strong and long-lasting international relationships with other monarchs or career diplomats.
1.1.1.7.1.1.5.6. Con: Periodic and regular elections are an essential part of [democracy](https://web.stanford.edu/~ldiamond/iraq/WhaIsDemocracy012004.htm). Elections have to take place at regular intervals to strengthen democracy and to bring about peaceful transition from one government to another.
1.1.1.7.1.1.5.6.1. Pro: According to [Article 21](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the will of the people should be the basis of the authority of government and should be expressed in periodic and genuine elections.
1.1.1.7.1.1.5.6.1.1. Con: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is aspirational only and not binding on monarchies.
1.1.1.7.1.1.5.6.1.2. Con: In the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, a binding convention, the UK, Luxembourg and Spain [made reservations](http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/eurolaw.htm) to protect the institution of monarchy.
1.1.1.7.1.1.5.6.1.2.1. Pro: Spain made the reservation that the Convention shall not affect the constitutional provisions concerning succession to the Spanish crown.
1.1.1.7.1.1.5.6.1.2.2. Pro: The UK made the reservation that none of the obligations would affect succession and the enjoyment of ceremonial titles such as peerage and honorific titles.
1.1.1.7.1.1.5.6.1.2.3. Pro: Luxembourg made the reservation to protect hereditary transition of power.
1.1.1.7.1.2. Con: Not all forms of political stability are equally development friendly; much depends on the extent to which stability translates into good governance.
1.1.1.7.1.2.1. Pro: [Instability](http://www.hoover.org/research/political-instability-source-growth) born out of a competitive political system, where different parties must fight to gain leadership, can lead to efficiency gains which are economically beneficial.
1.1.1.7.1.3. Pro: Political instability can adversely affect growth by [lowering the rates](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268012000675) of productivity growth.
1.1.1.7.1.4. Pro: Political instability creates uncertainty, which tends to discourage foreign investment.
1.1.1.7.2. Con: Monarchies only increase trade with other [monarchies](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nrc.nl%2Fnieuws%2F2015%2F04%2F27%2Fde-koning-heeft-alleen-meerwaarde-voor-handelsmissies-naar-monarchieen-a1496718&edit-text=&act=url).
1.1.1.7.3. Pro: Brands that have been awarded the Royal Warrant reportedly benefit from up to a [5% boost](http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-royals-warrant-idUKKCN0R20Z220150902) in their sales, as it is a mark that symbolises quality and bestows tradition.
1.1.1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.1.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.2.
1.1.1.7.6. Pro: [Harry Van Dalen](https://www.nidi.nl/en/staff/overview/vandalen) wrote a paper claiming the Dutch Royals caused economy to grow about 1 percent per year, adding [4 to 5 billion euros](https://nltimes.nl/2017/04/28/royal-family-cost-dutch-taxpayers-eu414-million-2017) to the Dutch economy per year.
1.1.1.7.7. Pro: There are also other income streams that could and should be explored. Such as endorsement, pave a way for larger corporate deals internationally, use and let royal estates and more.
1.1.2. Con: Monarchy avoids the exceptionally high cost of elections to determine the symbolic head of state, in addition to electing the head of government.
1.1.2.1. Con: These elections mean that the head of state represents the people, this is a benefit which may justify the cost.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The choice of who should represent the nation officially, allows an opportunity for the public to decide the image which they would like to portray internationally through their head of state.
1.1.2.2. Pro: All national elections represent a significant expenditure.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: The US election in 2016 cost [6.8 billion](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2016s-price-tag-6-8-billion/) per candidate.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: The French government commits to reimbursing  [approximately €8 million](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sophie-meunier/france-election-laws_b_1438456.html) towards campaign costs for candidates who achieve more than 5% of votes in the first round. Even those who do not achieve this are reimbursed €800,000. This is a considerable investment in campaign funding alone since [eleven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_presidential_election,_2017#First_round) candidates ran in the last election.
1.1.2.2.3. Pro: The 2010 UK general election cost [£113,255,271](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3369919/general-election-2017-cost-taxpayers-spending/)
1.1.2.3. Con: Many European nations, such as Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia and Malta, elect their president by [parliamentary vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Union_member_states_by_political_system). This avoids the cost of an election.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, Slovakia and Slovenia all elect their head of state \(President\) by [popular vote.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Union_member_states_by_political_system) This is a costly addition to the expense of electing the legislature.
1.1.2.5. Con: it is a fallacy to imply that you need to elect a symbolic head of state if you have no monarch. [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Switzerland) is a good example of a very stable and rich country without a monarch or president \(they have a rotating system of ministers in which the current chairman also acts as the head of state\).
1.1.2.6. Pro: Many European [parliamentary republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_republic) \(except France, Portugal, Poland, Ukraine, and Romania, that are semi-presidential systems\) have a [ceremonial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_system_of_government)/non-executive Head of State distinct from the executive head of government.
1.1.3. Con: Monarchies aren’t inherently more expensive than other forms of head of state.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The Queen of the UK is the [most expensive](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/queens-birthday-how-much-does-elizabeth-ii-cost-the-uk-compared-to-other-european-monarchs-a6994106.html) monarch in Europe but not the most expensive head of state. In [2013](http://royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/insight/think-a-republic-would-be-cheaper-than-monarchy-think-again-40065) the British Monarchy cost taxpayers £35.7 million.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: That is only because the official figure for the cost of the British monarchy [excludes](http://cdn.mashreghnews.ir/old/files/fa/news/1391/5/21/198224_310.pdf) a number of costs, including round-the-clock security, lavish royal visits and lost revenue from the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall. Considering all these extra costs, the British monarch is likely to be a more expensive Head of State.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Taxpayers are kept in the dark about the exact cost of the British monarchy, due to the royal household's exemption from the [Freedom of Information Act](https://www.royal.uk/freedom-information) and widespread misunderstanding about the nature of the royal family's finances.
1.1.3.2. Pro: In 2013 the President of France cost taxpayers [£91 million.](http://royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/insight/think-a-republic-would-be-cheaper-than-monarchy-think-again-40065)
1.1.3.3. Pro: In 2013 the Italian President cost the taxpayers [£181.5 million.](https://www.thelocal.it/20131217/italian-politics-costs-taxpayers-a-year)
1.1.3.4. Con: Comparative research concludes that monarchs as heads of state are generally more costly, monarchies' budgets tend to be less transparent \(and are therefore more difficult or impossible to compare\) and have allocations to family members \([Matthijs, p. 265](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\).
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Often members of the royal family are also entitled to an allocation or inclusion in the civil list \(government payments to the head of state\) in a monarchy. In republics, however, an allocation is only made to the President.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: In the Netherlands, the regnant monarch and the crown prince are included in the civil list. There’s also a possibility of allocations to the former monarch and their spouse \([Pg.249](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\). A similar arrangement is also practised in Norway \(Pg.247\) and Luxembourg \(Pg.259\).
1.1.3.4.1.2. Pro: A lump sum is set aside for the Royal Couple and Crown Prince and Princess in Spain and Sweden.\([Pg.246, 258](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.4.1.3. Pro: Belgium and Denmark use a very extensive system of allocations and all the children of the head of state are entitled to an allocation. \([Pg. 255, 257](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.4.2. Pro: Tax breaks are extremely limited in republics but not in monarchies.
1.1.3.4.2.1. Pro: The King, the Queen, the Crown Prince, and the latter's wife are exempt from taxation in Norway. \([Pg.247](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.4.2.2. Pro: The Grand Duke and his family are exempt from private income tax and the wealth tax in Luxembourg. \([Pg.260](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.4.2.3. Pro: The Queen, the Prince Consort, the Queen’s sister, Crown Prince  and the Crown Princess are exempt from personal income tax and traffic taxes in Denmark. \([Pg.257](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.4.2.4. Pro: In the Netherlands, the three persons who currently receive an allocation are exempt from paying tax on the allocations made for them in the budget. They are also exempt from traffic and inheritance tax. \([Pg.252](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.4.2.5. Pro: The German and French Presidents do not enjoy any special tax benefits. \([Pg.261](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.4.2.6. Con: The civil list beneficiaries of Sweden and Spain are not allowed any tax privileges. \([Pg.259,245](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.4.2.6.1. Pro: All members of the [Spanish royal family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Spain#Annual_budget_and_taxation) are subject to taxation and annually submit Income Tax and Wealth Tax returns.
1.1.3.4.2.7. Pro: The Royal Family of Belgium only pays tax on income from private sources. The civil list and the people who get allocations are exempt from tax. \([Pg.256](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.4.3. Pro: Republics offer greater budgetary openness as compared to monarchies.
1.1.3.4.3.1. Pro: All expenditure related to the presidency is consolidated in a single budget in France and discussed in the standing parliamentary commission for finance. A detailed overview of all the receipts and expenses that have to do with the functioning of the head of state are given by the French state budget and the audit of the accounts of the Presidency by France’s Court of Accounts. \([Pg.262](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.4.3.1.1. Pro: There is a strict distinction between the public and private expenditure of the President of France and the President bears his personal expenditure himself.
1.1.3.4.3.2. Pro: In Germany, the federal budget presents the costs of the President in detail and makes a distinction between the costs for the office of the President and costs related to the administration of the head of state .The Federal Audit Office is responsible for the external auditing of the budget. \([Pg.261](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.4.3.3. Pro: Budgetary systems that merely specify sums of money are used in Belgium,Luxembourg, Denmark, Spain and Sweden. \([Pg.255, 259, 257, 245, 258](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.4.3.4. Pro: The functioning of the head of state in republics is the subject of an annual report containing details about the presidential finances. There is a legal framework for this purpose in France and Germany. \([Pgs. 262,261](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.4.3.4.1. Con: Royal finances are also the subject of an annual report. This is the case in Norway, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark. \([Pg. 248, 252, 253,258, 257](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.4.3.4.1.1. Con: The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Spain and Belgium do not publish annual reports related to royal finances. \([Pg. 259, 245, 255](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.4.3.5. Con: Greater budgetary openness is no guarantee or argument for being cheaper.
1.1.3.4.3.5.1. Con: The question of the state's cost in democracies is not only about the cost itself, which differs greatly among countries, but the level of transparency, which is a key element in any democratic system.
1.1.3.4.3.5.1.1. Con: It should be a key element in any democratic system, therefore also with constitutional monarchies like the European ones. It is up to the chosen politicians to make the choice for more budgetary openness.
1.1.3.4.3.5.2. Con: Since state budgets in democracies are funded through taxes, it is imperative that citizens can know where and how is their money spent, regardless if more or less money is actually spent.
1.1.3.4.4. Con: The costliness of a government is no reason for its abolition.  Governments should be maintained if they are legitimate no matter the cost \(imagine  a very expensive democracy\). Most monarchies are indeed legitimate because monarchs have legitimate claims to ownership of the land they control.  Hence monarchies should not be abolished.
1.1.3.4.5. Con: The linked research clearly shows France being double as expensive compared to the most expensive monarchy [\(p. 264\)](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf).
1.1.3.4.6. Con: The research doesn't take the increase in GDP through monarchy into account. One can only say that a monarchy is more expensive when the net profits are lower than a republic.
1.1.3.5. Con: It's not that monarchies are more expensive than other forms of government, but that the cost is in addition to the current government.
1.1.3.6. Pro: The entire reign of Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands was cheaper than the money spent on the [2016 congressional and presidential](https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/cost.php) election in the USA. The entire reign of [Queen Beatrix](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=nl&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fbiz.tpo.nl%2F2013%2F04%2F29%2Fbeatrix-leverde-nederland-145-miljard-op%2F&edit-text=) was 3.762.000.000 euros \($4.429.002.600\) and the US election a total of $6,444,253,265. And she brought in [148,5 billions](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=nl&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fbiz.tpo.nl%2F2013%2F04%2F29%2Fbeatrix-leverde-nederland-145-miljard-op%2F&edit-text=) of Euros of profit from trade.
1.1.3.6.1. Con: However, it is calculated that the Dutch royal family cost its citizens [€41 millions](https://nltimes.nl/2017/04/28/royal-family-cost-dutch-taxpayers-eu414-million-2017) in 2017. And considering all the costs, the average cost is [around](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9412600/Dutch-royal-family-overtake-Britains-as-most-expensive-in-Europe.html) [30 million euros](https://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-info/dutch-expat-news/dutch-royal-family-now-most-expensive-europe) annually. In fact, [nowadays](https://nltimes.nl/2018/04/25/dutch-royals-cost-far-budget-says-report), Dutch royals are the most [expensive](https://www.independent.co.uk/money/this-is-how-much-money-europes-royal-families-get-from-their-taxpayers-a7870711.html) monarchy, [surpassing](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9412600/Dutch-royal-family-overtake-Britains-as-most-expensive-in-Europe.html) the UK.
1.1.3.6.2. Con: The Dutch royal family costs taxpayers approximately [41.4 million euros a year.](http://nltimes.nl/2017/04/28/royal-family-cost-dutch-taxpayers-eu414-million-2017)
1.1.3.7. Pro: The German president, which cost [25million euros](https://www.bundeshaushalt-info.de/fileadmin/de.bundeshaushalt/content_de/dokumente/2016/soll/epl01.pdf) in 2016, [costs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/23/shut-up-royal-baby-haters-monarchy-is-awesome/) twice as much as the monarchies of Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain.
1.1.3.7.1. Con: Given the lack of transparency of monarchies' costs, it is likely that the real cost of these monarchies is greater than is publicly known.
1.1.3.7.1.1. Pro: Some of the actual costs of the Spanish monarchy are included in other chapters of the state budget, making its true cost around €60 million \([Matthijs, p. 247](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\)
1.1.3.7.1.2. Con: The  [Swedish monarch](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)'s accounts, which was reported at 14.5million euros in 2013, are subject to the scrutiny of the Swedish Court of Audit \(Riksrevisionen\) and reports are provided each year that describe their finances in great detail.
1.1.3.7.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.
1.1.3.7.2. Con: This should be looked at as a proportion of the country's tax revenue, rather than as a lump sum, as these countries vary greatly in size and economic wealth.
1.1.3.7.2.1. Pro: Germany's tax revenue for 2015 was [9 times higher](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REV) than Denmark's, 6 times higher than Belgium's and Sweden's and 56 times higher than Luxembourg's.
1.1.3.7.2.2. Pro: 25 million euros is just [0.00002%](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REV) of Germany's tax revenue in 2015.
1.1.4. Con: Abolishing monarchies to save public money is useless, as some of the abolished monarchies still have a right to retain some income.
1.1.4.1. Pro: In Bavaria there is a fund that provides life stipends to former royals, besides the fact that they still retain ownership of various properties in the region \([Lieb, p.28](https://books.google.es/books?id=z0-JAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=bavaria+stipend+for+former+royals&source=bl&ots=vQU2TKH8o-&sig=swjFUzcGx8dKil9QqIaL0UQp4dQ&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY8uS5xJfVAhXCUlAKHWtSCiUQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=bavaria%20stipend%20for%20former%20royals&f=false)\).
1.1.4.1.1. Con: The Bavarian case is more an exception than the rule as most former royals \(e.g. in Italy, Greece or Portugal\) do not receive a stipend from their countries.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Until 2002, the [Italian constitution even forbade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Savoy#Kings_of_Italy_.5B39.5D) male descendants of the House of Savoy from entering Italy.
1.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Although Greece’s former king [Constatine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/15/greece-former-king-exile-constantine-ii-anne-marie) has been able to return to his country, he was dethroned, stripped of his citizenship and his palaces and estates were expropriated. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that the Greek state had to compensate him in damages but only for a fraction of what he asked for.
1.1.4.2. Con: Parliament could decide to legislate to avoid making payments to former royals.
1.1.5. Pro: Selling off the state's possessions would create additional money in the country's budget, and reduce the tax burden for everyone in the country.
1.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.6.
1.1.5.2. Pro: The [Crown Estate](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33253411), in Britain, has a capital value of £11.5 billion and the Royal Collection is valued at £10 billion.
1.1.5.3. Con: Such a move would necessarily privatize what is essentially state property, erasing public property for a one-time budget boost.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Selling off everything might sound like a budget-boost. But due to free markets the actual sell value would probably be much lower, resulting in a diminishable boost on a country's budget.
1.1.6. Pro: Monarchy costs should be avoided, especially when people in a country are in dire need of help and taxes could be devoted to helping them.
1.1.6.1. Pro: In countries like Spain, where almost [half of young people are unemployed](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266228/youth-unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/), these costs should be avoided.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: These public funds could be better used to improve citizens' welfare.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: The Queen of England spent [£369 million](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/18/buckingham-palace-to-get-369m-facelift-over-10-years/) of taxpayers money on redecorating Buckingham Palace, when that money could have been spent on improving the NHS, re-establishing community centres, providing job skill training schemes or helping the elderly and the homeless.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: At the end of 2011, almost [1 in 4](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9319175/Spains-economic-crisis-a-timeline.html) of Spain's economically active citizens were out of work and the economy was in recession.
1.1.6.2. Pro: There is not reason why millions of tax payer's money should be put into a royal family when food banks, [homelessness](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/10/uk-homeless-expected-double-2041-charity-crisis-warns) and child [poverty](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/poverty-britain-joseph-rowntree-foundation-report-theresa-may-social-mobility-commission-million-a8089491.html) is on the increase in the UK.
1.1.6.3. Pro: Monarchs are able to enjoy lavish life at the expense of tax payers.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: Presidents of republics and other officials also enjoy wealthy lifestyles funded by taxes.
1.1.6.3.1.1. Con: Some of those officials are democratically elected and, when they are not, unlike monarchs, their terms are limited to a certain period and are not inheritable.
1.1.7. Pro: Unlike any other citizen, monarchs are often exempted from paying taxes.
1.1.7.1. Pro: The British Monarchy does not pay all the same taxes compared to regular citizens.
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: Unlike everybody else in the UK, the British monarchy is not legally bound to [pay inheritance tax.](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/may/06/queenmother.inheritancetax) It is one rule for the monarchs, and another rule for everybody else.
1.1.7.1.1.1. Con: This applies only to her direct successor, gifts left to other children or relatives will be [taxed in the usual way](http://www.hartreade.co.uk/legalupdate/does-the-queen-pay-inheritance-tax/)
1.1.7.1.1.2. Con: The [rationale behind this](http://www.hartreade.co.uk/legalupdate/does-the-queen-pay-inheritance-tax/) is that the Monarch is not able to work or trade and therefore is not able to “grow” their estate in the conventional ways many of us do throughout our lifetimes
1.1.7.1.2. Con: [Prince Charles](https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/faqs/does-the-prince-of-wales-pay-tax) pays income tax on his income from the Duchy of Cornwall.
1.1.7.1.2.1. Con: The Queen and The Prince of Wales make [voluntary payments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_the_British_royal_family#Taxation) instead of tax to compensate for their tax exemption. The are not legally obligated to do so.
1.1.7.1.3. Con: [Since 1993](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/26/newsid_2529000/2529209.stm), Queen Elizabeth's personal income has been taxable as is the case for any other tax payer.
1.1.7.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.1.2.1.
1.1.7.1.4. Con: The Queen[has always been](https://www.royal.uk/royal-finances-0) subject to Value Added Tax.
1.1.7.1.5. Con: The Queens income from Duchy Of Lancaster [is taxed](https://fullfact.org/economy/royal-family-what-are-costs-and-benefits/).
1.1.7.1.6. Con: The Queen [pays Council Tax](https://metro.co.uk/2017/11/06/does-the-queen-pay-taxes-and-how-much-does-it-cost-her-7056752/)
1.1.7.1.7. Con: The Queen and Prince Charles [pay Capital Gains Tax](https://metro.co.uk/2017/11/06/does-the-queen-pay-taxes-and-how-much-does-it-cost-her-7056752/)
1.1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.6.1.
1.1.7.3. Con: Even if all monarchs in Europe paid all the same taxes as a normal citizen, it would only make a negligible difference to annual tax income.
1.1.7.4. Pro: [King Willem-Alexander](http://www.nomoretax.eu/kings-presidents-pay-more-tax/) of the Netherlands receives a salary that is not taxed and does not have to pay gift or inheritance taxes.
1.1.7.4.1. Con: The Dutch royal family has been obliged to pay taxes on their [personal assets](http://nltimes.nl/2016/10/11/royal-tax-controversy-dutch-state-annually-pays-back-ruling-familys-taxes) since 1973.
1.1.7.4.1.1. Con: The Dutch royal family receives [financial compensation](http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2016/10/dutch-royals-get-financial-compensation-for-paying-tax-rtl-nieuws/) for the tax they pay over their income from assets.
1.1.7.4.2. Pro: It is estimated that King Willem-Alexander will get a tax-free allowance of [£4.9 million](http://www.nomoretax.eu/kings-presidents-pay-more-tax/) covered by taxpayers’ money in 2017.
1.1.7.5. Pro: [King Harald V](http://www.nomoretax.eu/kings-presidents-pay-more-tax/) of Norway does not pay any tax on his wealth.
1.1.7.6. Con: [Belgium's royal family](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-belgium-royals-tax-idUSBRE9550GJ20130606) pays income and value-added tax.
1.1.7.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.7.
1.1.7.7. Pro: In contrast, republics treat the presidents and prime ministers as regular residents for tax purposes and do not apply a highly preferential tax-free regime.
1.1.7.7.1. Con: The Prime Minister of the UK is eligible for a ['prime ministerial expenses deduction'](https://www.ft.com/content/aed06912-fece-11e5-ac98-3c15a1aa2e62) of £20,000 tax-free income, which no other citizen receives.
1.1.7.7.2. Pro: In most European countries, there are no specific laws exempting Head of States from income tax. Without a specific exemption, it means that they are taxed each year the same as regular citizens.
1.1.7.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.5.
1.1.7.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.
1.1.7.7.4. Pro: The monthly gross salary and residence allowance received by the president and the prime minister of [France](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=en&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do%3FcidTexte%3DLEGITEXT000006069577%26idArticle%3DLEGIARTI000018620290%26dateTexte%3D20090729&usg=ALkJrhhMItj1RpHG4WcT8dIxVrpBjFE_BA) are subject to income tax.
1.1.8. Pro: The cost of monarchy is attributable to costs such as the upkeep of buildings, the number of staff, official ceremonies, travels and security details.
1.1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.
1.1.8.2. Con: The buildings, staff, ceremonies, travel, and security details don't generally go away in a presidential-style democracy either.
1.1.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.1.8.3. Pro: The British royal family cost the taxpayer [40.1 million pounds](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/27/queens-income-rises-again-as-cost-of-royal-family-is-62p-per-per/) in the financial year 2015-2016.
1.1.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.1.
1.1.8.3.2. Con: That is roughly comparable to the annual interest on the 9 billion pounds the UK spent to host the Olympics in 2012.
1.1.8.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.5.
1.1.8.3.4. Pro: When the Queen of the UK visited Australia in 2006 \(a country where she is still the sovereign\) it cost the Australian taxpayers [$1.8 million](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-07-28/35542?pfmredir=sm) to host her. This illustrates overall costs.
1.1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.6.2.
1.1.9. Con: The practicalities involved in abolishing the monarchy may be more costly than the cost of keeping things as they are.
1.1.9.1. Pro: The cost of damages and compensations sought by the monarch following the abolishment of monarchy could be exorbitant.
1.1.9.1.1. Pro: The ex-Italian royal family sought [260 million euros](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1570096/Italian-royalty-want-compensation-over-exile.html) in compensation, as well as the return of all their jewelry and property, including the Italian's president's current residence.
1.1.9.1.2. Con: When Constantine II of Greece sought £320 million in compensation for his exile, he was only awarded a [small fraction](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjayuys2IjWAhWECcAKHRBhAq8QFggoMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2013%2Fdec%2F15%2Fgreece-former-king-exile-constantine-ii-anne-marie&usg=AFQjCNFMltGe8VJnaCCGJgDr9sYM9b8x1w) of his request.
1.1.9.1.3. Pro: At present, only 15% of the Crown Estate is awarded to the British Queen but, under abolition, the royal family may demand greater compensation, as the Crown Estate technically belongs to the reigning monarch.
1.1.9.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.
1.1.9.1.3.2. Con: A democratic legislature could choose not to award full \(or any\) compensation.
1.1.9.1.3.2.1. Pro: The British Royal Family's assets were acquired through their rule justified by "divine right." Because, under modern democratic theory, their rule was illegitimate, they may not be entitled to any of those assets.
1.1.9.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.3.2.
1.1.9.2. Pro: Monarchs usually have inherited personal wealth which is then used to serve the country and pay for them. If they were disestablished, the country would lose access to this wealth and would therefore not save money.
1.1.9.2.1. Pro: Without the benefit of the crown's estate, even more of the cost is covered by the state, as seen in [Ireland.](http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/politics/chefs-caterers-president-michael-d-8368945)
1.1.9.2.2. Con: If a country eliminated its monarchy, it could seize the assets of the monarch.
1.1.9.3. Con: It does not matter how costly the change is if the outcome is a better democracy and leads to a better government.
1.1.9.4. Pro: They're not causing any problems, so there's no reason to go through the hassle of restructuring them and finding a new place for their family in society.
1.1.9.4.1. Pro: Most European monarchies are still incredibly popular with their citizens, suggesting people do see a place for them in the 21st century. Clearly, they are not regarded as a significant democratic intrusion.
1.1.9.4.1.1. Pro: 70% of Dutch were happy with the monarchy in 2016 \([ipsos, p. 6](http://www.ipsos-nederland.nl/uploads/documenten/17025215_Ipsos_rap_v.2.0_site.pdf)\)
1.1.9.4.1.2. Pro: [75% of the British](https://www.ipsos.com/en/enduring-popularity-queen-elizabeth-ii) public believes the monarch has an important role to play in the country's future.
1.1.9.4.1.3. Pro: [70% of Swedes](http://royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/insight/how-popular-are-europes-monarchies-33508) support their monarchy as an institution.
1.1.9.4.1.4. Pro: [82% of Norwegians](http://royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/insight/how-popular-are-europes-monarchies-33508) are in favour of keeping the monarchy.
1.1.9.4.1.5. Con: Following the scandals of the Spanish royal family, support for the monarchy in Spain [has fallen.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/9949809/The-lonesome-king-of-Spain-how-Juan-Carlos-fell-from-grace.html)
1.1.9.4.1.5.1. Pro: The Spanish monarchy has been involved in [a string of corruption scandals.](https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/583980/Spain-royals-King-Felipe-Princess-Ciristina-drama)
1.1.9.4.1.5.1.1. Con: The fact that the Spanish monarchy has been involved in a string of corruption scandals whereas several Northern European monarchies have not suggests that monarchy is not the dependent variable in terms of varying corruption.
1.1.9.4.1.6. Pro: The British Monarchy has enjoyed a [very high percentage of support](http://royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/insight/how-popular-are-europes-monarchies-33508) for many decades, and republicanism seems to have never risen above 20%.
1.1.9.4.1.6.1. Con: The above linked source is possibly unreliable, since it's very pro-royal. [yougov.co.uk](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/09/08/monarchy-here-stay/) claims that 23% of people in the UK don't believe the monarchy will be in place in 100 years' time, modest evidence that they may be seen as outdated or a thing of the past by that 23%.
1.1.9.4.1.7. Con: Current European monarchies have a lack of democratic legitimacy because in a majority of these countries the apparent popularity of monarchy has only ever been measured in opinion polls, never in a formal referendum or election, which is the ultimate expression of democracy.
1.1.9.4.1.7.1. Pro: Opinion polls are [consistently unreliable](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/jan/27/dont-trust-the-polls-the-systemic-issues-that-make-voter-surveys-unreliable), and sample only a small part of the population. They cannot be considered proof of democratic consent to be subject to a monarchy.
1.1.9.4.1.7.2. Con: If monarchies, in general, have not been legitimised through the urns, neither have many republics. One example is Portugal. None of the three republics that rose in the 20th century, in Portugal, were subject to referenda.
1.1.9.4.1.7.3. Con: Democracy is not the only form of political legitimacy and it is fallacious to make the assumption that "the will of the people" is a meaningful or useful measure of selection of leadership. What a person \(or country\) wants is not the same thing as what a person \(or country\) actually needs. A popular leader is not the same thing as a good leader or a useful leader; electoral history of modern democracies shows this time after time.
1.1.9.4.1.7.3.1. Con: While democratic elected leaders in many countries may have not been the best politicians or have been corrupted or ineffective, [authoritarian and totalitarian](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/World_History/The_Rise_of_Dictatorship_and_Totalitarianism) leaders, have been among the most atrocious leaders, in many cases responsible for wars and genocides.
1.1.9.4.1.7.3.1.1. Con: Many authoritarian and totalitarian leaders came to power first through democratic means.
1.1.9.4.1.7.4. Con: A referendum was held in [Luxembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg_referendum,_1919) in 1919 to ask voters about their preferred form of government. A large majority pronounced itself in favour of keeping the monarchy [\(80%\)](http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/le-grand-duche-se-presente/histoire/histoire-mots/referendum1919/index.html).
1.1.9.4.1.7.4.1. Con: Since 2016, the left party Déi Lénk has [petitioned](https://www.wort.lu/en/politics/petition-petition-calls-for-referendum-on-scrapping-luxembourg-monarchy-57ceae83ac730ff4e7f6601e) for a new [referendum](https://translate.google.es/translate?sl=fr&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dei-lenk.lu%2Fprise-de-position-sur-le-referendum%2F&edit-text=) so that citizens can decide if the monarch should be kept as the Head of the State or not.
1.1.9.4.1.7.5. Con: A referendum was held in [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_monarchy_referendum,_1950) in 1950 and the proposal of restoring Leopold III to the throne was approved by 57.68% of voters.
1.1.9.4.1.7.5.1. Con: A referendum was held to give Belgians the option to decide whether King Leopold III could resume his royal powers and duties as King of the Belgians, yet they were not given the possibility to opt out of monarchy.
1.1.9.4.1.7.6. Pro: A referendum on the popularity or future of monarchy has [never](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Monarchy_referendums) been held in Britain, Denmark, Holland, Norway, Spain, Sweden or the principalities of Liechtenstein and Monaco.
1.1.9.4.1.7.6.1. Con: While referendums have not been held, high popularity ratings on polls reflect strong consensus, which would suggest there is not a strong need to call an official referendum on the issue.
1.1.9.4.1.7.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.1.7.1.
1.1.9.4.1.7.6.1.2. Pro: For example, the Danish royal family is supported by approximately 71% of the population and only opposed by approximately 15%, according to a 2016 [survey](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dr.dk%2Fnyheder%2Findland%2Fmaaling-kongehuset-ligesaa-populaert-som-40-aar-siden&edit-text=&act=url).
1.1.9.4.1.7.6.2. Con: Referenda can be used in a manipulative way by authoritarian or populist politicians \([www.publico.pt](https://www.publico.pt/2016/06/25/politica/noticia/os-referendos-sao-bons-para-a-democracia-1736281)\).
1.1.9.4.1.8. Con: The principle of a republic is that the population should be allowed to decide their head of state. This right to choose cannot be denied because of with popular support right now, as future voters may not wish to have a monarch as symbolic head of state. To provide ongoing consent, each head of state should be elected.
1.1.9.4.1.9. Con: Many television shows and comedians are also popular with every day citizens. People are interested in that which is unusual and entertaining. Not every motivation is political.
1.1.9.4.1.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.1.7.6.1.2.
1.1.9.4.1.11. Pro: In a given country where the majority expresses approval for the monarchy, this institution should be maintained as that would be respecting the will of the people.
1.1.9.4.1.11.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.1.7.
1.1.9.4.1.11.2. Con: To respect the will of the people, the most democratic measure would be to hold a referendum or some type of official consultation and not just rely on opinion polls carried out through population samples.
1.1.9.4.1.11.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.1.7.6.
1.1.9.4.1.11.2.2. Con: In Spain there was a referendum on a new constitution in 1978, after the fall of Franco, and 88,54% of citizens that took part voted in favour of it \(Romão, p. 14 - [ces.uc.pt](http://ces.uc.pt/publicacoes/oficina/ficheiros/8156_oficina_do_ces_399.pdf)\).
1.1.9.4.1.11.2.2.1. Con: The Spanish [referendum](https://www.britannica.com/place/Spain/Government-and-society#ref913891) included the option to approve the Constitution, which declared Spain as a [Constitutional Monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Spain#Part_II:_The_Crown) and Juan Carlos de Borbón \(previously [appointed](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/10911793/Spanish-monarchy-five-surprising-facts.html) by Francisco Franco\) as king, or the option to not approve it, which could likely lead to great uncertainty after 40 years of a military dictatorship. Therefore, Spaniards were not given the option to vote for a monarchy or republic as a form of government.
1.1.9.4.2. Con: The issue is not if they cause problems, but what monarchies inherently represent.
1.1.9.4.2.1. Pro: The concept of democracy is [in definite contrast to monarchy](http://www.differencebetween.net/miscellaneous/politics/difference-between-monarchy-and-democracy/). Conceptually, while the first is a type of government that puts power in the hand of the nation’s people, the second bestows power in the hand of an individual.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1. Pro: The head of state in a monarchy is a fixed, hereditary figure who takes up office by virtue of accident of birth rather than through elections and the will of the people.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1. Con: The head of the government in a constitutional monarchy, however, is a member of the parliament.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: The real issue here is, the people that head monarchies are born into it. People who are given such positions as leaders should demonstrate the skill and ability needed to represent a large population of people. Especially if said people are paying taxes to uphold them.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Because monarchies are hereditary, the problem is precisely that if monarchs do not demonstrate skill and ability to represent their citizens, unlike elected officials, they cannot be voted out of their positions.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2. Pro: In democracies the will of the populace is the least corruptible form of decision making.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.1. Con: The will of the populace can be shaped by the media, which often distorts objective facts for ratings and audience.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Selective [exposure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_exposure_theory) theory and [reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_theory) theory explain how humans tend to seek and remember information that reinforces their own preexisting beliefs. Consuming more biased information just makes for even more uniformed opinions.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: [Studies](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~garrettk/Garrett-ICA-Seeking_Similarity-final.pdf) have shown that, while people prefer to find or follow news that are similar to their own beliefs, they do not actively avoid difference. The analysis shows that Americans use the control afforded by online information sources to increase their exposure to opinions consistent with their own views, without sacrificing contact with other opinions.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Social media algorithms, such as the one [Facebook](https://www.wired.com/2016/11/facebook-echo-chamber/) uses, create and reinforce echo-chambers of political views.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Credible media outlets have demonstrated the will and competence to provide accurate reporting
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.1.3. Con: Fact-checking websites and journalism awards \(i.g. the Pulitzer prize\) provide checks against inaccurate reporting and incentives for insightful reporting.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Lazy people, who cannot be bothered to vote in a responsible way won't bother to fact-check.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.2. Con: The public is often uninformed on specific policies, and votes on emotion rather than rationality.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Uninformed decisions are not the same thing as corrupted decisions.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Uninformed decisions are still poor decisions, regardless of whether or not they are corrupted.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: If someone is uninformed, they are likely to vote for irrational reasons.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.2.2.1. Con: There is no such thing as an irrational reason to vote. If an individual chooses to vote based on how much they like the candidate's name, then that is them exercising their democratic right.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Having a right to do something does not automatically make it a good \(or rational\) idea to do that thing.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: People can vote in response to a hot-button issue or a scandal, or in reflection of a psychological attachment to a political party; rather than voting for the party that best represents their policy preferences.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.2.2.2.1. Con: If that issue is what they care most about at the time of the election, it is unclear why it is a bad outcome for them to voted based on it.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.2.2.3. Pro: Ignorant or [uninformed citizens](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yoani-sanchez/from-information-to-actio_b_8546858.html) are easy victims of manipulation and control.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.2.2.3.1. Pro: Large parts of the [British public](https://www.rt.com/uk/346342-brexit-voters-ignorance-misinformation/) had a misguided perception of the EU, mainly due to ignorance and misinformation, and thus voted to leave.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: Interested and informed voters could have easily found out that the populists' [numbers](https://www.rt.com/uk/346342-brexit-voters-ignorance-misinformation/) and "facts" about the EU were wrong.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2.3. Pro: [60% of the 60](https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/22/corruption-government-dictatorship-biz-corruption09-cx_mp_0122pei.html) most corrupt countries are autocratic regimes.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3. Con: Most of the European monarchies are constitutional monarchies, which are [recognized as democracies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index).
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.1. Pro: In a [constitutional monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy), as opposed to an absolute monarchy, power politically rests with the people, as represented by the [parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament) which consists of members elected by the electorate.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: In a [parliamentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system#Europe) system of democratic governance the executive branch \(consisting of ministers\) is held accountable to the popularly elected legislative branch \(the parliament\).
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Unlike an elected executive, there are almost no normal mechanisms by which to hold a monarch accountable.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.1.2. Con: You can have the parliamentary democracy without the monarchy, as they do in France and many other republics.  Democracy exists in spite of it, not because of it.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.1.3. Con: In the UK, the upper house known as the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords) is comprised of those with peerage titles. These members are not elected by the people.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: It was not until 1958 that laws in the UK allowed non-hereditary life peers to sit in the House of Lords, also granting women access for the first time. Today, still [92](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nobility) [hereditary peers](https://books.google.es/books?id=iXu7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA193&dq=hereditary+peerage&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bfxHUoe8E8HAhAfZwYGACA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=hereditary%20peerage&f=false) sit on the House, they are elected by the other hereditary peers by ballot and replaced on death. Very few are female and some titles can only be inherited by men.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.1.3.2. Pro: The Earl Marshal, responsible for ceremonial functions, and the Lord Great Chamberlain, who serves as the monarch representative, are still entitled to a sit in the House of [Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nobility).
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.1.3.3. Con: Non-royal hereditary peerages are practically not given anymore and only [four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peerage_of_the_United_Kingdom) have been created since 1964 and two of those are now extinct.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.2. Con: The fact that a country is a democracy does not mean there are no undemocratic power structures. In a proto-democracy all power vested in a person by the state must be either acquired through elections by the people, or indirectly through an elected official or institution that was elected by the people. If there is the potential for the monarch to override the laws made by parliament as part of that constitution, then the country is effectively not a democracy.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.2.1. Con: Even if this is the case that the functionality is somewhat different to republics, it is incorrect to define constitutional monarchies not as democracies as they are [recognised](http://www.constitutionnet.org/sites/default/files/monarchies_0.pdf) as a type of democracy by states, political theorists and most civilians.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.2.1.1. Con: They may resemble democracies, and function as though they are democracies. However appearances are not synonymous with actualities. Unless the monarch is entirely voted for by the people, and unless the monarchy has absolutely no theoretical/hypothetical potential to overrule the democratic system, it is categorically not a democracy.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Most European countries with a monarch are still considered democracies. It is semantics to say otherwise. An example is the UK:  even though the monarch is not voted for by the people, and she has theoretical power, the UK is [still considered a democracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom).
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.3. Con: Although some European monarchies are recognized as democracies in practice, the monarch, and not the people, is technically considered the Sovereign.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.3.1. Pro: This is shown in the UK, in that parliamentarians must swear an [oath of allegiance to the monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_Allegiance_\(United_Kingdom\)#Parliamentarians) \(not the people\).  They are unable to take their seat without doing this.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.4. Con: In his book, [Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition](https://books.google.com/books/about/Polyarchy.html?id=JcKz2249PQcC), renowned political scientist Robert Dahl explained that democracy is not a binary but rather exists as a scale. [Important considerations](http://www.wikisummaries.org/wiki/Polyarchy#Chapter_6:_Equalities_and_Inequalities), such as political, social, and economic egalitarianism, are all undermined by monarchy.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.5. Con: Monarchies are at odds with democracy, despite the fact that many monarchies today have democratic elements. In most western monarchies, monarchs allowed democratic elements only because they were forced to.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.5.1. Pro: The [Magna Carta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta), under which the King of England recognized certain rights of his subjects, came into effect as [the result of a rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta#Background).
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.5.2. Pro: The [Polish Constitution of May 1791](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_3_May_1791), which transformed the monarchy into a constitutional monarchy, was the result of extensive strife and rebellions against the king.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.5.3. Pro: The Glorious Revolution in the United Kingdom [effectively ended the possibility of an absolute monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution#Legacy), even after the restoration.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.5.4. Pro: The French Revolution initially forced the king to head a [constitutional monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution#Constitutional_Monarchy) and recognize an elected assembly. The monarchy was only fully abolished due to his resistance to that idea.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.5.5. Con: Democracy is a form of government that has proven to promote economic prosperity and peace. A constitutional monarchy doesn't hinder this despite not being inherently democratic.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.6. Con: They are usually considered democracies because they have some kind of elected  bodies, like parliament, government and so on. So they are considered democracies, despite the royals.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.7. Pro: None of these European monarchies are acting as unilateral, fundamentally undemocratic powers. It is very possible for members of royalty to fully support democracy and that is the case in all of these European countries.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.8. Pro: Monarchies such as Norway, Sweden and Denmark are amongst the highest ranking countries on the [Democracy Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index).
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.8.1. Pro: Sweden is a monarchy, yet is recognised as the [most egalitarian](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-11-most-equal-countries-in-the-world-2011-10?international=true&r=US&IR=T#1-sweden-gini-230-11) society.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.8.1.1. Con: The Scandinavian monarchies \(Sweden, Denmark, and Norway\) are regarded as among the most egalitarian countries of the world according to the Gini Coefficient, but aside from all being constitutional monarchies, they share many other traits--there is little reason to suspect that monarchy is what sets them apart.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.8.1.1.1. Pro: Gender equality, good reputation, a high quality education system \(that excels in foreign languages\) as well as income security and good pensions, are all factors linked to a [Nordic welfare model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model) and also the main reasons for Nordic countries' [successes](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/why-sweden-beats-most-other-countries-at-just-about-everything/).
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.8.2. Pro: Norway, a monarchy, is one of the most egalitarian countries in the world, according to the [Gini index](https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/datablog/2017/apr/26/inequality-index-where-are-the-worlds-most-unequal-countries).
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.8.2.1. Con: The Gini index is a measure of economic inequality. This is not relevant for the discussion of egalitarianism, which says that people should all have equal rights independent of, for example, blood line, as in the case of monarchy.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3.8.3. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.1.3.2.
1.1.9.4.2.1.4. Pro: Modern monarchs acquired and retained their wealth and power by means incompatible with current notions of liberal democracy. They have no legitimate claim to their titles, wealth, or power: they are not ordained by God and are not elected by the People.
1.1.9.4.2.1.5. Con: Rule by an individual is more efficient and effective than rule by a collective. An individual will carefully consider and reflect and examine their conscience before making a decision. Individuals also have \(and take\) responsibility for their actions. Collectives don't have \(or take\) responsibility for their actions, and their members tend to rely on every other member to take charge of the thinking for them. Also, mobs will dare to impose tyrannies that an individual would find unconscionable.
1.1.9.4.2.1.5.1. Con: By that logic, regimes with totalitarian leaders would always be better than parliamentary systems.
1.1.9.4.2.1.6. Con: When people vote to have a monarchical system for they country, then that cannot be seen as opposed to democratic principles since the will of the people is taken into account.
1.1.9.4.2.2. Pro: The concept of a monarchy clashes with egalitarianism.
1.1.9.4.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.1.3.8.1.
1.1.9.4.2.2.2. Pro: Monarchy takes the idea of racism one step further: There is no master race - there is a master family. It is thus is the purest form of rule by genetics.
1.1.9.4.2.2.3. Pro: The existence of a family or lineage that inherits power or privileges through bloodline and accident of birth is contrary to the ideals of egalitarianism.
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.1. Pro: Every monarchy is based on aristocratic bio-social assumption of genetic superiority of some persons and their descendants over many others, so that their status in any institutional setting, in any relationship would be unequal to anyone of a 'lesser' genotype.
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.2. Pro: One of the fundamental premises of democracy is [meritocracy](http://www.wikisummaries.org/wiki/Polyarchy#Chapter_6:_Equalities_and_Inequalities). By according royal families disproportionate wealth, influence, and power by sole virtue of their birth, monarchies undermine this principle.
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.3. Pro: Monarchy means that a certain group of people gets privileges just by "the grace of God". This is a contradictory message for our democratic systems
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.4. Pro: The UK provides an example of a democracy whose continued tolerance of the monarchy opposes its other stated principles. The elimination \(for the most part\) of hereditary peers from the legislative branch following the [1999 House of Lords act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords_Act_1999), was based on the idea that obtaining political position through inheritance is undemocratic. This principle is incompatible with Monarchy.
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.4.1. Con: It is worth noting that politically appointed life long peers in the House of Lords are not accountable to the people either and have proven more open to corruption, scandals and politics of party over country, showing that even those that were put there in a democratic principle are themselves not necessarily democratic.
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.5. Pro: Monarchy propagates the hereditary principle of power - monarch should be selected at random from a suitable group of candidates instead.
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.5.1. Con: Monarchies don't have to be hereditary, and could be elected instead. Reforming monarchies could be a better system than abolishing the monarchy.
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.5.1.1. Pro: Monarchies are not inherently incompatible with democratic principles, as elective monarchies can exist or have existed.
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.5.1.1.1. Pro: An elective Monarchy has existed in [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_elections_in_Poland), where the Monarch was chosen by a body called the Sejm.
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.5.1.1.1.1. Con: The elective monarchy used in Poland was not democratic in the modern sense. Only members of the nobility were able to vote for the king.
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Because only nobles were able to vote in the election, more powerful nobles were able to [exert significant control over less wealthy or powerful nobles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_elections_in_Poland#Influence). As a result, the elections were not very democratic even among the nobility.
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Elections are not the only aspects of democracy that matter. [Other fundamental characteristics](http://www.wikisummaries.org/wiki/Polyarchy#Chapter_1:_Democratization_and_Public_Opposition), which were did not exist under the Polish elective monarchy, include the ability to freely form preferences, signify those preferences publicly, and have those preferences considered by the government on an equal basis of the opinions of others.
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.5.1.1.2. Pro: According to common lore, even some Americans toyed with the idea of an elective monarchy with [George Washington](http://www.newsweek.com/americas-lost-monarchy-man-who-would-be-king-92243) as King following the revolution.
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.5.1.1.2.1. Con: The founders of the United States, and George Washington himself, [largely opposed the establishment of any monarchy](https://www.utne.com/politics/presidential-power-ze0z1210zgar).
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.5.1.1.3. Con: No contemporary European monarchy is elective. All are hereditary.
1.1.9.4.2.2.3.5.1.1.4. Con: Even where a monarch is "elected" "democratically," by definition there is no real mechanism by which to hold the monarch democratically accountable after election.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4. Pro: The existence of a monarchy sustains the traditional class system regardless of it having little or no political power.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.1. Con: According to a recent [study](http://voxeu.org/article/what-s-your-surname-intergenerational-mobility-over-six-centuries), in Florence, Italy - a democracy - the richest families have been the same for six centuries. So, low social mobility doesn't seem to have a correlation with monarchy.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.1.1. Con: Italy may actually prove the link between low social mobility and monarchy since it only stopped being a monarchy in [1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Italy).
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2. Pro: Monarchy encourages the perpetuation of social ranks.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.1. Pro: According to several studies, the UK has a patent lack of [social mobility](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/aug/28/elitism-in-britain-breakdown-by-profession) explained by “entrenched [elitism](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/13/uk-social-mobility-elitism-alan-milburn)".
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: Out of 36 OECD countries, the UK is the fourth most [unequal](http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-8-major-economies-with-most-inequality-2017-8/#1-chile-047-8) country \(along with Spain\) before redistribution, and has the 6th highest level of inequality after redistribution, being the third more unequal country in Europe.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: While inequality is high in Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain, the UK has similar levels of high inequality, yet its [GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe_by_GDP_\(nominal\)) is much higher \(and the second best in the EU\) and economic indicators such as [unemployment](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268830/unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/) rates or [debt](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269684/national-debt-in-eu-countries-in-relation-to-gross-domestic-product-gdp/) in relation to GDP are significantly better.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.1.2. Pro: In the EU, the UK is also the most unequal country in terms of GDP per inhabitant in [purchasing power](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Gross_domestic_product_\(GDP\)_per_inhabitant_in_purchasing_power_standard_\(PPS\)_in_relation_to_the_EU-28_average,_by_NUTS_2_regions,_2014_\(%25_of_the_EU-28_average,_EU-28_%3D_100\)_RYB2016.png), with the biggest variation between the lowest and highest regions. While the national average is a little upper 100, the highest region situates the limit above 500.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.1.3. Pro: The UK is still divided by [three](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/aristocrats-own-third-of-land-in-england-and-wales-2130392.html) legal standings: the Sovereign, peers \(historical hereditary peers or newly created for members of the royal family, or life peers who are granted a sit in the House of Lords\) and commoners.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.1.4. Con: This entrenched elitism is linked to governments' history of [short-term thinking](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/13/uk-social-mobility-elitism-alan-milburn), and could arguably be redressed through economic and social policies, rather than by abolishing the monarchy.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.1.5. Pro: Other top professions are also comprised by [privately](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2235719/Britain-run-private-school-elite-study-shows.html) educated people.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.1.6. Pro: In the UK, 71% of senior judges, 50% of Lords and 33% of MPs attended [private](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/aug/28/elitism-in-britain-breakdown-by-profession) schools, which educate only the 7% of the countries’ children.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.1.6.1. Con: The existence of \(unelected\) Lords in the British political system is a symptom of how undemocratic monarchy is. The fact that so many Lords attended private schools is an indication that the aristocracy and royalty are both out of touch.

1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.1.7. Con: The UK's lack of social mobility stems from the country's [education system](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-28953881) .
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.2. Pro: British [nobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nobility) still plays a role in the UK in the 21st century.

1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.3. Pro: Swedish nobility still, according to most recent research, occupies many prominent positions.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.3.1. Pro: In Sweden, 31 of the 50 biggest owners of arable land still belonged to the old nobility in the 21st century [\(Bengtsson et al., p. 17\)](http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/26235457/LUP_161.pdf).
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.3.2. Pro: Research points that social mobility in Sweden has been downplayed and that nobility still monopolise prestige occupations [\(Clark in Bengtsson et al., p. 17\)](http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/26235457/LUP_161.pdf).
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.4. Pro: Royal and noble [ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_and_noble_ranks) are bestowed by the monarchy.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.3. Pro: Monarchy encourages deference and quasi-feudal behaviour.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.1.3.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.3.2. Pro: [Subjects](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/International/story?id=7228105&page=1) are supposed to [bow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowing) or [curtsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtsey) in the presence of royals.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.3.2.1. Pro: In the UK, visitors and staff of Buckingham palace were, until recently, supposed to [walk backward](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/5994745/Royal-tradition-takes-a-backward-step-as-the-Queen-bows-to-health-and-safety-concerns.html)s when they exited a room in the Queen's presence.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: For [safety](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/5994745/Royal-tradition-takes-a-backward-step-as-the-Queen-bows-to-health-and-safety-concerns.html) concerns and potential litigations, the practice has been generally abandoned except for the Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps and the Queen's equerry.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.4. Pro: Monarchy represents a focus for exclusion and elitism.
1.1.9.4.2.2.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.1.
1.1.9.4.2.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.1.3.8.2.
1.1.9.4.2.2.6. Pro: Although monarchies can be combined with relative economic equality, it is at best that "All are equal but some are more equal". Even then people across society do not have the same rights and opportunities that royals have, so the example set is not egalitarian. Society accepting this differentiation creates or encourages the desires and legitimises the efforts of others to also be elevated above others.
1.1.9.4.2.2.7. Pro: A monarchy is hardly an example for any person who wishes to accomplish a great deal from their hard work when a family have a predicated privelege to luxury.
1.1.9.4.2.2.7.1. Con: Monarchs work harder than most ordinary people and, unlike ordinary people, do not have the luxury of retirement or promotion to look forward to in their work.
1.1.9.4.2.2.7.1.1. Con: Queen Sonja of Norway worked just [63 days in 2013.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2530111/Hes-finally-King-Prince-Charles-named-hardest-working-royal-Europe-Queen-right-him.html)
1.1.9.4.2.2.7.1.2. Pro: Prince Charles worked [189 days in 2013](https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/news-and-diary/diary), while MPs in the UK work at Westminster for [148 days.](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/apr/23/who-works-most-teachers-or-mps)
1.1.9.4.2.2.7.1.2.1. Con: The remaining 22 weeks that MPs have are often allocated to other constituency work and party conferences. Furthermore, on average politicians work [69 hour weeks](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/apr/23/who-works-most-teachers-or-mps) , compared to an average of [42.7 hour weeks](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16082186) across the UK.
1.1.9.4.2.2.7.1.3. Pro: The Queen of England, aged 89, attended [341 engagements](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/12077343/Queen-carries-out-more-engagements-than-William-Kate-and-Harry-combined.html) in 2016 alone.
1.1.9.4.2.2.7.1.4. Pro: The British royal [family](http://www.thisisinsider.com/what-does-the-royal-family-do-2017-1) has about 2,000 engagements, entertains 70,000 guests, and answers 100,000 letters every year.
1.1.9.4.2.2.8. Pro: Monarchy implies [superiority of "blood"](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/9747412/Duchess-of-Cambridge-discovers-blue-blood-in-her-own-family.html), which may lead to racism, far-right extremism and eugenics.
1.1.9.4.2.2.9. Pro: Equality before the law is one of the pillars of democratic governance. Yet European monarchs are often 'above the law', meaning that they cannot be brought into court and punished.
1.1.9.4.2.2.9.1. Con: Legal immunity is not limited to monarchs. Some countries, such as Greece, [grant legal immunity](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/experience-sharing-programme/docs/i.androulakis_the_problem_of_political_immunities_in_greece_en.pdf) to members of parliament.
1.1.9.4.2.2.9.2. Pro: Although not required by the Constitution, [in Spain](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/18/spain-king-queen-immunity-abdication), the former King Juan Carlos and the Queen have been made "aforados", meaning they can only be tried by the Supreme Court. Past actions carried out during his time as King are still [immune](http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/spain-readies-legal-shield-for-king-juan-carlos-578353) to judgement.
1.1.9.4.2.2.9.2.1. Con: According to the legal doctrines of [sovereign immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity) and [head-of-state immunity](https://definitions.uslegal.com/h/head-of-state-immunity/), the sovereign, state and head of state cannot commit a legal wrong, and are immune from civil suit or criminal prosecution. They aren't limited to just constitutional monarchies.
1.1.9.4.2.2.9.2.2. Con: [The Prime Minister](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/18/spain-king-queen-immunity-abdication), his cabinet and public prosecutors are amongst the 10,000 public figures granted this legal status from the Spanish judicial system. This is not a special privilege solely awarded to the monarchs.
1.1.9.4.2.2.9.2.2.1. Con: However, politicians and public figures lose their condition of “[aforados](https://elpais.com/elpais/2014/04/17/inenglish/1397727700_217554.html)” once they cease their functions. That is not the case of the former King who, moreover, retains total immunity for any past actions.
1.1.9.4.2.2.9.3. Pro: In constitutional monarchies the sovereign is the historical origin of the authority which creates the courts. Thus, the courts have no power to compel the sovereign to be bound by the courts, as they were created by the sovereign for the protection of their subjects.
1.1.9.4.2.2.9.3.1. Pro: [The sovereigns of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity#Norway) the UK, Belgium, Spain, Denmark and Norway cannot be prosecuted in their personal capacity, nor can they be required to give evidence in court.
1.1.9.4.2.2.9.3.1.1. Pro: Queen Elizabeth was [reported](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-40359502) to West Yorkshire Police for not wearing a seat belt but was not charged. According to the law, not wearing a seat belt can result in a fine of £500.
1.1.9.4.2.2.9.4. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.9.2.1.
1.1.9.4.2.2.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.
1.1.9.4.2.3. Pro: Monarchy is an example of legalized inequality that goes against the [first article](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \(UDHR\), according to which all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
1.1.9.4.2.3.1. Pro: The Head of State in a monarchy is hereditary with the eldest male child prioritised over any female siblings.
1.1.9.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: In Spain, the throne is held by Felipe VI, instead of his older sister Elena.
1.1.9.4.2.3.1.2. Con: Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK now adhere to [absolute primogeniture](https://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/2010/02/equality-in-the-line-of-succession/) for succession, whereby the eldest child inherits the throne regardless of gender.
1.1.9.4.2.3.1.3. Pro: The monarchy of Liechtenstein practises strict [agnatic primogeniture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Liechtenstein), meaning only first-born males can be heirs to the throne.
1.1.9.4.2.3.2. Pro: The only way monarchies could be acceptable would be if they were passed by referendum instead of hereditary.
1.1.9.4.2.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.1.7.
1.1.9.4.2.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.1.1.
1.1.9.4.2.3.4. Pro: Conferring political power on the basis of privilege and accident of birth hampers the establishment of fluid meritocratic and democratic societies.
1.1.9.4.2.3.4.1. Con: Privilege gained by inheritance brings with it responsibility to serve others and support those who are less fortunate.
1.1.9.4.2.3.4.1.1. Con: Privilege gained by inheritance has less accountability and thus it is not clear why it is accompanied by responsibility to help the less fortunate.
1.1.9.4.2.3.4.1.2. Pro: Aristocratic families own property which has been in the family for many centuries and in many cases provides a livelihood for local communities. This is a form of guardianship which considers the long-term rather than short-term profit and loss decisions.
1.1.9.4.2.3.4.2. Pro: Although in the 19th century, nobility was polarised during the industrialisation and a new ruling class, the bourgeois, emerged, high nobles became richer and, as a comprehensive research in Sweden suggest, in Europe nobility was still the dominant class afterwards, even if its total wealth was reduced \([Bengtsson et al., p. 17-19](http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/26235457/LUP_161.pdf)\).
1.1.9.4.2.3.4.2.1. Con: The argument about increased share of wealth by high nobles in Sweden is based on one country and one part of its aristocracy and doesn't specifically explain the link to political power and any impact on democracy. It is therefore not sufficient.
1.1.9.5. Pro: Most countries are facing much more pressing issues that need attention, meaning they cannot afford to abolish the monarchy.
1.1.9.5.1. Con: It is possible to address more than one matter at once.
1.2. Pro: Monarchies no longer have real power and therefore are unnecessary.
1.2.1. Con: Where a parliamentary democracy is in place, monarchies generally have the same constitutional prerogatives as heads of state.
1.2.1.1. Pro: The [President of Estonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Estonia) acts as a ceremonial Head of State with no real executive power.
1.2.1.2. Pro: The elected President of Iceland has such ["limited powers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Iceland) that they have [no term limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Iceland).
1.2.1.3. Pro: The elected Irish president ["plays a ceremonial role in the running of the State."](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/the_president/functions_of_the_president.html)
1.2.1.4. Con: The crucial distinction is that their power is not as easily removed by parliament where it exists.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: The Italian President has the Authority to [dissolve the Parliament](https://www.justlanded.com/english/Italy/Articles/Culture/Government-in-Italy). Their democratic legitimacy means that they cannot be denied this power as easily as monarchs are theirs.
1.2.1.5. Pro: Constitutional monarchy is preferable to parliamentary republic, where the president's power is also ceremonial. A monarch with purely ceremonial duties is less anonymous than a president with the same limited authority, and as such a better representative for their nation.
1.2.2. Pro: In a parliamentary system, the monarch is primarily a head of state.
1.2.2.1. Con: In [many nations](http://www.businessinsider.com/most-powerful-world-leaders-2015-11/#14-benjamin-netanyahu-1), such as [France](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/how-powerful-frances-president), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Russia#Powers_and_duties), and [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Italy#Role), the head of state exerts significant political influence and "rules" the nation along with other branches of government.
1.2.3. Con: Even if monarchs do not have real power, they have the right to power by virtue of their legitimate rule from the consent of those they govern, the divine right to rule, or their ownership of their lands.  Because monarchs have a right to rule, they should not be abolished even if they have lost "real" power.
1.2.3.1. Con: The consent of the people towards a monarchy can only be tested through a referendum, and most of the surviving European Monarchies have not been validated that way. Furthermore, divine right is a medieval concept, and is in direct conflict with the values of a secular, egalitarian, democratic regime.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.1.7.6.
1.2.3.2. Con: A monarch's "right to rule" is the result of an accident of birth, and does not span from the will of the people, like the right to rule of a democratically elected official.
1.2.4. Con: Raw political power is not the only thing that matters in social cohesion and good governance.
1.2.5. Con: Monarchies have the power of influence, within their countries and abroad, regardless of whether they retain hard power.
1.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.7.3.
1.2.5.2. Con: This power of influence has no democratic legitimacy. It is wrong to allow a person so much influence when the people whom the decision affects gave no consent to their position.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: There is widespread acceptance of democratic values in Europe. This influence and power to an unelected individual undermines this democratic principle within nations which purport to support it.
1.2.5.2.2. Pro: Monarchs have undeserved influence over public opinion.
1.2.5.2.2.1. Pro: Monarchs are not inherently wiser and more intelligent than your average citizen, yet they hold a dangerous influence over the minds of masses. Therefore, monarchs, simply by having opinions, are weakening the democratic process.
1.2.5.3. Pro: In some instances, monarchs are able to offer apologies for past injustice more readily than elected politicians. This provides cathartic change from past injustice, when often parliament might have stayed silent.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: In the UK, the Queen's candid remarks on the Troubles in Northern Ireland, offering her ["sincere thoughts and deep sympathy"](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ireland-queen-idUSTRE74H2NW20110518) was vital in allowing both sides to enter the peace process which had been laid out in the [1998 agreement](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/136652/agreement.pdf).
1.2.5.3.2. Pro: A monarch's freedom from electoral pressures means that they can offer apologies and symbolic actions of peace and respect more readily than elected politicians i.e. before an apology would be palatable to the electorate.
1.2.5.3.2.1. Con: In an effort to maintain the dignity of their position, many monarchs are unwilling to admit fault or apologise. King Juan Carlos' [apology](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/18/spain-king-apologises-shooting-elephants) in 2012 was the ["the first public apology by a Spanish monarch in history"](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2012/0418/King-Juan-Carlos-unprecedented-apology-speaks-to-royals-changed-image)
1.2.5.3.2.2. Con: Monarchs are still extremely vulnerable to the effects of public opinion, meaning that the use of their power is implicitly determined by the will of the people.
1.2.5.3.2.2.1. Con: Being subject to the pressure of public opinion is very different from representing the will of the people.
1.2.5.3.2.2.2. Pro: In Liechtenstein, according to the [Constitution](https://www.gesetze.li/lilexprod/dloadpdf.jsp?smatik=201), the Prince is subject to a popular vote of no confidence \(Art. 13ter\). Furthermore, the Constitution itself provides a procedure to abolish the monarchy upon popular request \(Art. 113\).
1.2.5.3.2.2.3. Pro: When the UK Queen visited the site of the Amritsar massacre, her decision to stop short of a frank apology was made by political ["policy makers"](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/15/world/in-india-queen-bows-her-head-over-a-massacre-in-1919.html?mcubz=0), demonstrating how unwilling to cause political strife she was.
1.2.5.3.2.2.4. Pro: [In 1976,](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-big-question-what-is-the-extent-of-european-royalty-and-does-it-still-have-a-role-1675709.html) when the public discovered that the Dutch Queen's husband accepted a bribe to influence the government's decision, he was forced to resign from a number of his positions of power.
1.2.5.3.2.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.1.7.
1.2.5.3.2.2.6. Pro: King Leopold III of Belgium was forced to abdicate in favour of his son following [widespread protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Question#General_strike_and_abdication) and a general strike.
1.2.5.3.2.2.7. Pro: A referendum held in Greece that saw [69% of people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_monarchy#21st_century) vote against the monarchy resulted in its abolition.
1.2.5.3.2.2.8. Pro: In 1936, [King Edward VIII](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/edward-viii-abdicates) of the UK abdicated due to public pressure and widespread disapproval of his marriage.
1.2.5.3.2.3. Pro: The British example illustrates this. While the British PM offered apologies for [individual instances of violence](http://www.bbc.com/news/10322295) in Northern Ireland, the Queen is unique in offering sympathies and expressing regret for the suffering of [all victims of the 'Troubles'](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13447236).
1.2.5.3.2.3.1. Pro: Even at present a failure to unequivocally condemn the IRA is [politically dangerous](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/21/growing-row-jeremy-corbyns-links-ira-refuses-five-times-condemn/). This may explain why politicians have proven unwilling to offer the same kind of unequivocal and wide reaching remarks that the Queen has.
1.2.5.3.2.4. Pro: Upon Ghana receiving independence in 1961, The Queen of England [danced](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/opinion/why-the-queen-matters.html?mcubz=0) with the first Prime minister. Such an act of respect was [described by the government directed local press](https://books.google.ie/books?id=4gyVj2f2BgwC&pg=PT152&lpg=PT152&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false)  "a fascinating change in the current relationship between Britain, the Common Wealth and Ghana".
1.2.5.3.2.5. Pro: In 2010, King Albert II of Belgium [attended](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/belgium-revisits-the-scene-of-its-colonial-shame-2014055.html) the 50th anniversary of Congolese independence, paying his respects and acknowledging the horrors committed under Belgian colonial rule.
1.2.5.3.2.5.1. Pro: This move happened without parliamentary support, where the matter sparked ["heated debate"](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/belgium-revisits-the-scene-of-its-colonial-shame-2014055.html).
1.2.5.3.2.5.2. Con: Despite being a divisive issue, legislature did show an ability to act a full eight years previously, organising an ["unprecedented investigation into his country's murky colonial past"](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/18/congo.andrewosborn)
1.2.5.3.3. Pro: A monarch's symbolic position as above electoral politics means that some consider their apology to ["go further"](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/dec/05/race.monarchy) than the words and actions of specific politicians.
1.2.5.3.4. Con: -> See 1.2.5.3.2.1.
1.2.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.
1.2.5.5. Pro: In the UK, the Prime Minister ["has a weekly meeting with the Queen to discuss current policy issues"](http://www.owen.org/blog/414). This provides the monarch with a large degree of unofficial influence.
1.2.5.6. Pro: Regardless of whether monarchs have de facto or de jure political power, they still [wield considerable economic influence](https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/865286/richest-royal-family-europe-net-worth-wealth) and are frequently the wealthiest family in their country. Wealth carries with it [significant](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/how-to-influence-politics-if-youre-wealthy-a-five-step-guide/360978/) [power](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/us/politics/how-wealth-plays-into-politics-at-a-personal-level.html) in itself.
1.2.5.7. Pro: Monarchs can use their permanence to set up long-standing networks of influence through the patronage of voluntary bodies that keep state-led organisations in check.
1.2.5.7.1. Pro: The British monarch is patron to more than [600 bodies](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36460398), 433 of which she has been at the helm of since 1952.
1.2.5.7.2. Pro: [Prince Charles' charities](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/21/royal-charities-lobbied-ministers-officials) lobbied government ministers and senior officials to change policies on politically sensitive topics including VAT rates and regional development spending.
1.2.5.8. Pro: Monarchs' support of issues overlooked by the government can help these causes reach the national agenda.
1.2.5.8.1. Pro: European monarchs have played an important role in raising the profile of environmental protection.
1.2.5.8.1.1. Pro: King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden's work on protecting the environment won him the US Environmental Protection [Agency Award.](https://sweden.se/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Monarchy-low-res.pdf)
1.2.5.8.1.2. Pro: Prince Albert of Monaco has established a [foundation](http://www.fpa2.org/home.html) to fund environmental protection projects.
1.2.5.8.1.3. Pro: Royals' support of environmental issues have made it into tabloid magazines, [such as Hello!](https://www.ft.com/content/598c0dba-3587-11df-963f-00144feabdc0), where monarchs are regularly featured, thereby further raising awareness about climate change with the world.
1.2.5.8.2. Pro: The British Royal family have taken an important role in boosting the [public profile of mental health.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/20/mental-health-royal-family-government-children-illness)
1.2.5.8.3. Pro: Royal patronage of an organisation can lead to a growth in public support and fund-raising.
1.2.5.8.3.1. Pro: [The Charity Market Monitor](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16414839) showed that in 2009 charities relating to services and veterans saw a 6.2% growth in public fund-raised income, which correlates with the British monarchy's increased vocal support for services charities at the time.
1.2.5.8.3.2. Pro: The annual Patron's Lunch at Buckingham Palace in the UK is a chance for charities with royal patrons to [invite donors](https://fundraising.co.uk/2017/07/11/royal-patronage-helps-charities-boost-awareness-says-research/) to encourage further donations.
1.2.5.8.3.3. Pro: Donors are often attracted to charities with a royal patron, as it increases their chances of meeting or being affiliated with members of the royal family.
1.2.5.8.3.3.1. Con: Such a process perpetuates social inequality and elitism by rewarding the social elites with special meetings with the royal family.
1.2.5.8.4. Pro: Princess Diana of the UK is credited with [changing the image](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Princess+Diana+changes+image+of+HIV&oq=Princess+Diana+changes+image+of+HIV&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.4583j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) of AIDS/HIV after being photographed with somebody suffering from the illness.
1.2.5.9. Pro: It is still very common for monarchs to meet with leaders of other nations and other monarchs highlighting their position of influence.
1.2.5.9.1. Pro: Queen Elizabeth II has [received](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_state_visits_received_by_Queen_Elizabeth_II) many leaders during state visits since 1954. For example, she received the King and Queen of Spain in 2017 and the President of Portugal in 2016.
1.2.5.10. Pro: The Queen of England [reportedly](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/10539479/Only-the-Queen-understands-the-true-value-of-the-Commonwealth.html) used her influence as Head of the Commonwealth to persuade Jerry Rawlings, the Ghanian president, to step down at the end of his term in accordance with Ghana's constitution.
1.2.5.10.1. Pro: Even if this influence is not directed to her own country, it ties with UK's colonial past and proves the monarch's power.
1.2.6. Con: Some monarchies have proven to have real political power.
1.2.6.1. Pro: [In Liechtenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Liechtenstein), the prince has the power to appoint judges, dismiss government and veto legislation.
1.2.6.2. Pro: [In Belgium](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-big-question-what-is-the-extent-of-european-royalty-and-does-it-still-have-a-role-1675709.html), the monarch of the Belgians has power in the formation of the government, he meets with the prime minister weekly, and regularly summons other ministers and opposition leaders to the palace.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: The Belgian monarch has to sign laws but has no [veto](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2013/0720/Tongue-tied-monarch-Belgium-s-Philippe-faces-a-linguistically-split-country) power.
1.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: When King Baudoin, former King of Belgium, refused to pass a law on [abortion](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2013/0720/Tongue-tied-monarch-Belgium-s-Philippe-faces-a-linguistically-split-country) because of religious reasons, he was sanctioned by the government as “unable to rule”. The law was passed and he was deemed able to rule again after two days, effectively removing him from political decisions without stripping him from his royal position.
1.2.6.2.1.1.1. Con: That was a [violation of the constitution](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=nl&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=nl&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/een-koning-die-wetten-ondertekent-is-dat-nog-van-deze-tijd/article-opinion-596583.html&usg=ALkJrhgOWchyFXFAB3HBjyNd-TD1GfCHhQ), the Belgium monarchy doesn't have a say in the contents of laws.
1.2.6.3. Pro: In the Netherlands, the monarchy is considerably powerful.
1.2.6.3.1. Con: In the Netherlands, the monarch is an official member of the government, but the king has no political responsibility.
1.2.6.3.1.1. Pro: [Article 42 of the Constitution](https://www.prodemos.nl/english/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/04/Politics-in-the-Netherlands-2013.pdf) of the Netherlands is extremely clear on this matter saying that "the Government shall comprise the King and the Ministers" and  "the Ministers, and not the King, shall be responsible for acts of government". [\[Source, pg. 13\]](https://www.prodemos.nl/english/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/04/Politics-in-the-Netherlands-2013.pdf)
1.2.6.3.2. Pro: In The Netherlands the King \(or Queen\) still has to sign laws and international treaties, in order for them to be passed as official legislation.
1.2.6.3.3. Pro: The monarch [chairs the council of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_Netherlands#Political_role) which scrutinises government legislation before it is put to parliament.
1.2.6.3.4. Pro: The monarch used to appoint [the formateur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_Netherlands#Political_role) \(i.e. the politician whose job it is to form a coalition government after general elections\) and is still involved in the process.
1.2.6.3.4.1. Con: The role was  "a result of political tradition" rather than one of influence. [\(PvdA, p. 7.](https://www.pvda.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/10165-pvda-vandenberg-adviescommissiekoninklijkhuis.pdf) [Google translation, p. 7\)](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=nl&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=nl&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pvda.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F08%2F10165-pvda-vandenberg-adviescommissiekoninklijkhuis.pdf&edit-text=&act=url).
1.2.6.3.4.2. Con: However, legislative [changes](https://remco.es/en/brief-introduction-to-the-process-of-forming-government-in-the-netherlands/) in 2012 have removed the monarch from this task and it is now performed by the House of Representatives. The responsibilities of the monarch are therefore increasingly minimised.
1.2.6.4. Pro: Monarchs have intervened during times of crisis.
1.2.6.4.1. Pro: The monarch in some states can act as a last resort defending democracy against abuse.
1.2.6.4.1.1. Pro: In the UK, the signature of the monarch is required before any [new primary legislation is passed](http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/passage-bill/lords/lrds-royal-assent/). Theoretically they could choose to withhold assent for legislation that represented a gross abuse.
1.2.6.4.1.1.1. Con: Most forms of government, including many [European republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto#European_republican_systems), also allow some form of [veto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto) on legislation, depending on the constitution or convention. Presidential systems, as well as monarchies have these kind of checks on the legislature.
1.2.6.4.1.1.1.1. Con: In Germany the president can easily be deposed by the parliament and under Merkel as well as in [1933 this Institution failed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_von_Hindenburg) to prevent unwanted changes. In times of crises a monarch can give stability by taking advantage of his almost undeductible veto-right.
1.2.6.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Unlike monarchs, presidents have been democratically chosen by the citizens or by representatives that citizens also democratically chose.
1.2.6.4.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.7.1.1.5.6.
1.2.6.4.1.1.2. Pro: [Queen's Consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Consent) is required before the legislature can debate a bill affecting the prerogatives or the interests of the crown.
1.2.6.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: [Prince's Consent](https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmpolcon/784/784.pdf) is required before the legislature can debate a bill affecting the [Duchy of Cornwall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Cornwall).
1.2.6.4.1.1.2.2. Con: Most of the royal prerogative powers in the UK are exercisable [only on the advice of government](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN03861) ministers.
1.2.6.4.1.1.2.2.1. Con: The UK monarch has the power to [appoint and remove](http://royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/insight/what-are-the-queens-powers-22069) Ministers of the Crown.
1.2.6.4.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: In practice, the monarch would not dare exercise that power if it were deemed undemocratic, thus making the power largely for show.
1.2.6.4.1.1.2.3. Pro: [Whitehall papers](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/14/secret-papers-royals-veto-bills) revealed that at least 39 bills were required to receive the seal of approval from the Queen or Prince Charles.
1.2.6.4.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: In 1999, Queen Elizabeth II [refused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Consent#Consent_granted_or_withheld_on_advice_of_the_cabinet) to signify her consent to the Parliament of the UK debating the [Military Action Against Iraq Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Action_Against_Iraq_\(Parliamentary_Approval\)_Bill), which sought to transfer power to authorise military strikes against Iraq from the sovereign to parliament.
1.2.6.4.1.1.2.3.2. Pro: The Palace of Westminster \(Removal of Crown Immunity\) Bill in 1988 and the Reform of the House of Lords Bill in 1990 could not be debated in the [British parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Consent#cite_note-16) because Queen's Consent was withheld.
1.2.6.4.1.1.2.4. Pro: [Official legal advice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/queens-or-princes-consent) makes clear that the Queen's and Prince's consent is not a mere formality. The process by which consent is obtained, which includes consulting with the royal household and seeking legal advice from its solicitors, provides a clear opportunity for the Queen and the Prince of Wales to influence the shape and content of a bill before it reaches Parliament.
1.2.6.4.1.1.3. Con: [In the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty_in_the_United_Kingdom#Parliament_Acts), royal powers can be removed or otherwise modified by an act of Parliament, which would happen in short order if any monarch decided to attempt to ignore the Cabinet and seriously utilize their theoretical powers.
1.2.6.4.1.1.3.1. Con: Both the Opposition and the Lords would likely recognise the danger in giving effective legislative supremacy directly to Government, and might block any such attempt.
1.2.6.4.1.1.3.2. Pro: The monarchy has seen its [executive powers reduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689) over the centuries, largely due to a widespread view of hereditary power as illegitimate. As such, exercising powers that would have significant political consequences may encourage the public to strip monarchs further of their powers. It is in monarchs' interest not to overexert their powers.
1.2.6.4.1.1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.1.2.3.2.
1.2.6.4.1.1.3.2.2. Con: Prince Charles’s [‘black spider’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_spider_memos) memos revealed his intervention in policy-making and showed that he made direct and persistent policy demands to the then prime minister Tony Blair and several key figures in his Labour government.
1.2.6.4.1.1.3.2.3. Pro: When Queen Elizabeth II's representative governor general in Australia dismissed the Prime Minister and replaced him with the leader of the opposition in 1975, it sparked a [constitutional crisis](http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/platparl/c04) and forced the governor general to resign.
1.2.6.4.1.1.3.2.3.1. Con: The constitutional changes made were minimal; the governor general of Australia [retained the right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis) to dismiss government ministers.
1.2.6.4.1.1.3.2.4. Pro: When monarchs interfere politically using their powers beyond representation, even if they are legally allowed to do so, elected officials find ways to void their actions, thus stripping real power from royals.
1.2.6.4.1.1.3.2.4.1. Pro: When [Luxembourg](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/12/luxembourg-monarchy)'s monarch refused to sign a bill regarding euthanasia because of his Roman Catholic belief, the legislature voted to amend the constitution so that the King’s approval was no longer necessary to pass a bill into law.
1.2.6.4.1.1.3.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.2.1.1.
1.2.6.4.1.1.3.2.4.3. Con: In 2011, the [Prince of Liechtenstein](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18649156) threatened to use his power of veto if a referendum held in the country on abortion resulted in its decriminalisation, as he was opposed to the idea due to his Roman Catholic beliefs. Because of the Prince's broad influence, voting in the referendum lost its power to bring about change and turnout for the vote was low. Abortion is still illegal in Liechtenstein.
1.2.6.4.1.1.4. Con: The monarch has not withheld assent [since 1708](http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/revolution/keydates/keydates1689-1714/).
1.2.6.4.1.1.4.1. Con: Although [royal assent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_assent) \(which is the approval of the monarch after the bill has passed in the Parliament\) has not been withheld since 1708, the [Queen's Consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Consent) and Prince's Consent, which are required before the bill is even discussed, have been withheld, thus blocking bills' discussion in the Parliament.
1.2.6.4.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.1.2.
1.2.6.4.1.2. Con: But so can happen with a democratic elected President of the Republic, there is no need of a king.
1.2.6.4.1.3. Pro: Norway has had a [King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haakon_VII_of_Norway) and a parliament which have co-existed in harmony in such a way that the King will only interfere when the country is challenged by a greater evil. This occurred in [1940](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Norway#German_invasion) when the Nazis started their [occupation](https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/the-kings-speech-review-jergen-christensen-best-foreign-language-film-1201957301/) and demanded that the Norwegian government should disband. The government agreed to surrender, but the King did not. He managed to a greater extent than the government to uphold the interests of the Norwegian people.
1.2.6.4.1.4. Pro: In 1981, following an [attempted coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23-F) in Spain, King Juan Carlos I gave a nationally televised address where he denounced the coup, called for the rule of law to be upheld and for the democratically elected government to continue in place. The coup soon collapsed.
1.2.6.4.1.4.1. Con: Declassified [documents](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/9072122/Juan-Carlos-was-sympathetic-to-1981-coup-leaders.html) and the undisclosed identity of the coup leader codenamed [White Elephant](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/17/books.booksnews), which some authors claim could have been former King Juan Carlos, suggest he was not in favour of democracy but actually supported the coup.
1.2.6.4.1.4.2. Con: The Spanish royal family was reinstalled by a fascist dictator: Franco.
1.2.6.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: Many Spaniards still link monarchy with fascism, as [General Francisco Franco](https://books.google.es/books?id=68pO6zzp3V0C&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=spanish+monarchy+is+expensive&source=bl&ots=OcR4Zp-BqR&sig=d8wFGfGowQQj5SDyAtl7WEtKJ3M&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjB_PW-oNTUAhVqIcAKHV5HDVUQ6AEITzAF#v=onepage&q=franco&f=false) had named Prince Juan Carlos de Borbón as his heir before his death.
1.2.6.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.7.1.1.1.1.
1.2.6.5. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.1.3.
1.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.1.3.2.4.
1.2.8. Pro: Most monarchs have constitutional prerogatives such as sanctioning laws, calling for elections or participating in the formation of government. However, those powers are generally consultive or ceremonial.
1.2.8.1. Pro: The Spanish monarch has [no executive or legislative power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Spain#Royal_assent.2C_judiciary.2C_and_promulgation_of_the_laws). They have a moderating and symbolic role.
1.2.8.1.1. Pro: Spain’s King Felipe VI could only organize rounds of talks with political leaders to end the [political deadlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_general_election,_2016) of 2016, without the possibility of interfering with the formation of a new government.
1.2.8.2. Pro: In [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#Politics_and_government), the role of the monarch is purely ceremonial.
1.2.8.2.1. Con: The Swedish king will change the [statutes](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sweden-academy/swedish-king-to-change-statutes-of-nobel-awarding-academy-idUSKBN1HP25K) of Nobel-awarding Academy, which is as close as possible to having actual political power.
1.2.8.2.2. Pro: Since 1974, the compromise acquired by Swedish politicians was to preserve the monarchy, yet to remove any former royal powers \([Nergelius, p. 41](https://books.google.es/books?id=vue3del4NAIC&lpg=PP1&dq=Constitutional+Law+in+Sweden&hl=sv&pg=PP1&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=former%20formal%20powers&f=false)\).
1.2.8.2.3. Con: However, the [monarch](http://www.kungahuset.se/royalcourt/monarchytheroyalcourt/dutiesofthemonarch.4.396160511584257f2180003302.html) is still the Head of State, heads the special cabinet council when the government changes and chairs the Advisory Council on Foreign Affairs.
1.2.8.2.3.1. Con: Yet even if these functions are legislated, some are not fully enforced or only representative and, in any case, the monarch should not have a position on controversial issues \([Nergelius, p. 42](https://books.google.es/books?id=vue3del4NAIC&lpg=PP1&dq=Constitutional+Law+in+Sweden&hl=sv&pg=PP1&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=former%20formal%20powers&f=false)\).
1.2.8.2.4. Con: The Prime Minister has to inform the monarch of the "affairs concerning the Realm” \([Nergelius, p.41](https://books.google.es/books?id=vue3del4NAIC&lpg=PP1&dq=Constitutional+Law+in+Sweden&hl=sv&pg=PP1&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=former%20formal%20powers&f=false)\).
1.2.8.2.4.1. Pro: A failure to do so, such when Prime Minister Göran Persson did not inform the monarch of Swedish victims in the 2004 Indian [tsunami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami), draws [criticism](https://www.thelocal.se/20141222/the-wave-sweden-will-never-forget).
1.2.8.2.4.1.1. Con: The Prime Ministers and his cabinet were mainly criticised for inaction or delayed action in their handling of the [tragedy](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4541590.stm).
1.2.8.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.8.2.3.1.
1.2.8.3. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.2.8.4. Pro: [In the UK](http://royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/insight/what-are-the-queens-powers-22069), the monarch’s political powers nowadays are largely ceremonial.
1.2.8.4.1. Con: In the UK, the appointment of the Prime Minister, waging war and various rights granted via the royal prerogative are all [powers](http://royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/insight/what-are-the-queens-powers-22069) held by the British monarch.
1.2.8.4.1.1. Con: The dissolution of Parliament is no longer a prerogative power under the [Fixed Term Parliament Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011).
1.2.8.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.1.2.2.
1.2.8.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.1.2.
1.2.8.4.1.4. Pro: Appointing members to the [Order of the Garter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Garter), [Order of the Thistle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Thistle) and [Order of Merit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Merit) is a personal choice of the Sovereign.
1.2.8.4.1.5. Con: In exercising personal prerogative powers, the monarch of the UK is bound to follow [constitutional conventions](http://cw.routledge.com/textbooks/9780415458528/ChapterOne.pdf).
1.2.8.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.1.
1.2.8.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.1.3.
1.2.8.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.1.2.2.
1.2.8.4.5. Con: The British monarch retains the power to [declare war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom#Constitutional_role) against other nations, which is the most important power.
1.2.8.4.5.1. Con: In practice this is done by the [Prime Minister](http://royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/insight/what-are-the-queens-powers-22069) and Parliament.
1.3. Pro: Monarchy creates social and class divisions.
1.3.1. Con: While monarchy leads to less representation for members of society, it is more likely to provide female heads of state than elections.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Even in situations where male siblings were given precedence, monarchy lead to female heads of state before democratic structures allowed it. The United Kingdom had its first Queen in [1553](http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/KingsQueensofBritain/). This is to be commended when in 2016, still only ["10% of 193 UN member states"](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/08/women-leaders-around-the-world/) have an elected, female head of state.
1.3.1.2. Con: Even if achieving more female representation is a a good and noble goal, if those who achieve it are only from a higher-up extract in society, then this may not be more equal representation.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: In a republic, even if the odds are stacked against female candidates, it is possible for any woman to become head of state. In a monarchy, this privilege is unfairly restricted to women within one family.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: The world in which royalty grow up, with wealth and privilege which is unknown to the majority of the population, may be so different that a Queen is not relatable to or representative of the majority of women in society.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: Monarchs, born into a life of privilege and luxury, can't relate to the lives of most of their citizens. Being so out of touch makes it harder to rule effectively.
1.3.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Politicians who have lived experience in areas such as law, business, economics, or public service are able to govern more effectively than a royal who has never experienced work.
1.3.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Many monarchs and future monarchs do have jobs.
1.3.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Queen Elizabeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II#Second_World_War) served in the [Auxiliary Territorial Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_Territorial_Service), the women's branch of the British Army during the Second World War.
1.3.1.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Prince William](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge#Military_career), second-in-line to the British throne, was part of the Royal Navy, British Army and the Royal Air Force. He also worked as an Air Ambulance pilot.
1.3.1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Donald Trump, whose experience prior to becoming the President of the US was primarily in business, is regarded as one of the worst presidents [in history.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-worst-six-month-approval-rating-in-history-poll-president-washington-post-abc-news-a7843821.html)
1.3.1.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: The most common professions for politicians around the world are [law and business](http://www.economist.com/node/13496638), as the skills displayed in both professions, such as command of procedure and diplomacy, translate well to the political sphere.
1.3.1.2.2.1.1.4. Pro: [In France](http://www.economist.com/node/13496638), when Nicolas Sarkozy was President, 9 out of 16 in his first cabinet were lawyers or law graduates, including the president, the prime minister and the finance minister.
1.3.1.2.2.1.1.5. Con: While these professions may have skills to assist them in politics, lawyers are typically regarded in polls in [England](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/07/24/public-want-more-mps-factory-fewer-courtroom/) as not a trusted profession. This impacts on their ability to govern effectively in the eyes of the populous.
1.3.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: The former king of Spain, Juan Carlos, was criticised for undertaking an expensive and elitist [hunting trip](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/9204680/King-Juan-Carlos-of-Spain-operated-on-after-elephant-hunting-accident..html) during which he shot elephants in Botswana at a time when his country was struggling with unemployment and an economic crisis.
1.3.1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.
1.3.1.2.2.1.3. Con: Not all politicians are chosen considering their balanced background or education. Falling out of touch depends on the individual's character, or how he/she reacts to the privileges that come with the position of power/wealth, not to any form government.
1.3.1.2.2.1.4. Con: Politicians are also accused of being out-of-touch due to their privileged backgrounds.
1.3.1.2.2.1.4.1. Pro: [48% of Conservative MPs](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-32692789) and 17% of Labour MPs in the UK attended private schools, while just 7% of the country's children do.
1.3.1.2.2.1.4.2. Pro: [19 out of 54](https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/ed-jones/these-figures-show-how-out-of-touch-uk-politicians-are-from-everyone-else) of the UK's Prime Ministers attended Eton, an expensive boarding school for boys with an elitist reputation.
1.3.1.2.2.1.4.3. Pro: In 1979, only 3.4% of MPs in the UK were previously employed in politics, yet in 2010 they represent the 15% of the total. The [tendency](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11498660/Revealed-how-many-General-Election-candidates-have-had-real-jobs-and-how-many-are-professional-politicians.html) in the last years shows that the number of career politicians rises, while the number of professionals and manual labourers declines and those coming from business remain stable.
1.3.1.2.2.1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.1.6.
1.3.1.2.2.1.5. Pro: [A YouGov survey](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1383684/Monarchy-out-of-touch-with-people.html) found that over half of the British public deemed its monarchy 'out of touch' with ordinary people's lives.
1.3.1.2.2.1.6. Pro: The Spanish monarch was accused of being [out of touch](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/9633830/Out-of-touch-Spanish-prince-shakes-hand-of-beggar.html) with its country's troubled economic situation after mistakenly shaking a beggar's hand.
1.3.1.2.3. Con: In this case it is not about equality across all factors, only for gender. And in most European monarchies \(with the advent of absolute primogeniture\) today there is a 50-50 chance of having a female head of state - while top political positions are a far cry from this level of equality.
1.3.1.3. Con: The number of female elected heads of states has [increased steadily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elected_and_appointed_female_heads_of_state_and_government) over time. As societies develop, more and more female heads of state will be elected.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: While the proportion of elected heads of state who are female is steadily increasing, the chance that the heir to the throne will be female is decided by birth, and so will not constantly increase. This means that over time democratic elections may become more likely to select a female head of state than monarchy.
1.3.1.3.2. Con: Democratic elections are proving very slow to appoint female candidates to positions of power. It was not until [1960](http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/) that the first female Prime Minister was elected, and at present, there are only [15](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/08/women-leaders-around-the-world/) female democratically elected heads of state.
1.3.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.1.
1.3.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.3.1.2.
1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.
1.3.3. Con: Race and [economic inequality](https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/jan/20/ethnic-inequality-widespread-global-economy) are greater causes of social and class divide than a monarchical presence.
1.3.3.1. Con: Racism, classism and sexism are all principles reinforced by having European monarchs which were generally rich, Caucasian males with little room for change in any of those aspects.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Monarchs in Europe have rarely varied in class, religion or race, meaning they are less representative of society.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: All 10 of Europe's hereditary monarchs since 1939 are descendants of a [common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_intermarriage#Modern_examples_of_dynastic_intra-marriage), which does not allow for much diversity.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: Monarchy is most often supra-national. Before the onset of WWI, all except two European monarchies were dual monarchies or ruled by a monarch of foreign nationality \(e.g. the House of Windsor is actually German\), and intermarriage with foreign monarchs in the mutual benefit of their kingdoms was encouraged.
1.3.3.1.2.1. Con: [Intermarriage](http://www.datasketch.es/october/code/nadieh/) across countries between royal families \(all of them Caucasian and European\) only strengthens the lack of diversity in terms of race, ethnicity and upbringing that are characteristic of royal families.
1.3.3.1.2.2. Con: Regardless of whether the monarchy is supranational, European monarchs were nearly all rich, white, and men. It was structurally not possible for a non-white, non-wealthy person to become a monarch.
1.3.3.2. Con: Monarchies exacerbate racial and economic inequality by empowering--either culturally, economically, or politically--a single race and economic class.
1.3.3.3. Pro: America, which has never had a monarchy, struggles with class divide fuelled by economic gaps and [racial inequality.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/education/edlife/black-america-and-the-class-divide.html)
1.3.3.4. Con: This does not deny the fact that a monarch is a symbol of inequality, as it perpetuates the class system and undermines the proper recognition of merit.
1.3.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.3.
1.3.3.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.4.
1.3.3.5. Con: The roots of modern economic inequality can be [traced](https://www.princeton.edu/~cboix/ARPS-2010.pdf) to class and economic divisions enforced throughout history by monarchs for their own benefit.
1.3.3.5.1. Con: Because modern economic inequality originated in the aristocratic structures that produced the monarchy, does not mean that this is still the cause.
1.3.3.5.1.1. Pro: There is no reason to think that abolishing the monarchy would help with this problem.  The modern class divide has far more to do with regulatory and wealth capture by rich landowners than it does to any aristocratic heritage.
1.3.3.5.1.2. Con: Even if monarchy were not the root of inequality or the cause of it nowadays, abolishing it could still be a step in the right direction if the goal is to achieve more equality.
1.3.3.5.2. Pro: Monarchies have a [strong effect](https://www.princeton.edu/~cboix/ARPS-2010.pdf) on the distribution of income and, over the years, have distorted the ratio between rules and producers in their favour, as well as that of their allies.
1.3.3.6. Pro: There is a [12% employment gap](https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/jan/20/ethnic-inequality-widespread-global-economy) in the UK  between white British and racial minority groups.
1.3.4. Con: There is nothing inherently wrong with social and class divisions.
1.3.4.1. Con: When the class division increases, the people born in the upper class will be more respected by the society, not because of what they have achieved but because of what the family they are born into. And the people in the lower will have less opportunities available for them to take advantage of.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Extreme example is the cast system in India. It essentially hinders the flourishing of human potential.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Social classes are necessary for hierarchy to exist. Hierarchy is necessary for social stability and allows civilisation to exist and flourish. Without hierarchy, societies become less stable, less mannerly and less happy and thus deteriorate.
1.3.5. Pro: A system of royal honors and privileges keeps the traditional social structures intact which makes social and political change less possible.
1.3.5.1. Con: Social and political change is not intrinsically desirable.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: Social and political change is evolutionary so happens whether desired or not.
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.
1.3.5.2. Con: A system of royal honours and privileges allow the monarch to bypass stagnant social class and recognize anyone, regardless of upbringing, as being worthy of recognition and praise.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: The [British honours system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders,_decorations,_and_medals_of_the_United_Kingdom) rewards people on the basis of their bravery, their contributions to a particular industry or their charitable services; it is a deeply meritocratic system.
1.3.5.2.2. Con: The [UK honours system](https://www.gov.uk/honours/nominate-someone-in-the-uk) is run by the Government of which the monarch is but a part. It is just as susceptible as any such system to cronyism and biased decisions about who should receive an award.
1.3.5.2.3. Con: Monarchs aiming to acknowledge and reward merit still perpetuate the foundation of unequal access to power and very high risk of biased application.  The best vehicles for meritocracy include safeguards like transparency and democracy and scholarship.
1.3.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.3.4.
1.3.5.4. Con: Maybe in pre-revolution France where repressive social classes and religious mandates were brutally enforced by the royalty, but none of the modern European monarchies we are discussing resemble this in any way. It is unclear how a symbolic monarchy makes social structures more rigid.
1.3.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.
1.3.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.
1.3.6. Pro: Monarchies enshrine a system of nepotism and cronyism. People close to the royals have unfair advantages over common people
1.3.6.1. Con: Anybody close to the people in power, regardless of democracy or any form of government have advantages over common people; nepotism and cronyism can occur anywhere. All peers in the UK House of Lords are appointed solely by the democratically elected Prime Minister. The House of Lords has been full of PM's cronies for the last hundred years, and swells in size with each new appointed PM.
1.3.7. Pro: The existence of a monarchy reduces the aspiration of ordinary citizens as they can never aspire to be the head of state.
1.3.7.1. Con: In most republics, it is impossible for ordinary citizens to become head of state. In the US, you need a huge [amount of money](https://www.thoughtco.com/how-much-money-do-you-need-to-run-for-president-3367626) just to be considered a viable candidate to run for office. The actual cost of campaigning and running for elections is left only in the hands of the pseudo-aristocratic elite in democratic countries.
1.3.7.1.1. Con: While running for president in the US is very expensive, European elections are generally [cheaper](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/24/world/global-campaign-finance/index.html), [funding](https://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/facts/DICE/Public-Sector/Public-Governance-and-Law/Financing-of-Political-Parties/Financing-political-parties-public-funding/fileBinary/Financing-political-parties-public-funding.pdf) is provided by the party and even funded by the [government](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/519217/IPOL_STU\(2015\)519217_EN.pdf) and there are [limits](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/political-parties-campaigning-and-donations/candidate-spending-and-donations-at-elections) on the amount candidates can spend.
1.3.7.1.1.1. Pro: Even in supranational entities like the European Union, political parties with representation also receive EU [funding](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/contracts-and-grants/en/20150201PVL00101/Political-parties-and-foundations).
1.3.8. Con: While it is true that class differences exist in monarchies this is also true of systems that are the polar opposite.  Even the old Soviet Union and its client states had its upper class people with private estates to which the ordinary citizens were not invited.
1.3.9. Con: Social trust, an important sociological and economic factor which promotes cohesion, [is higher in monarchies](http://hbanaszak.mjr.uw.edu.pl/TempTxt/Bjornskov_2006_Determinants%20of%20Generalised%20Trust%20A%20cross-country%20Comparison.pdf) \(pg.8\)
1.3.9.1. Pro: The lasting example of a monarch, unlike temporary presidencies, provides a role model to its citizens which [keeps them in check](http://hbanaszak.mjr.uw.edu.pl/TempTxt/Bjornskov_2006_Determinants%20of%20Generalised%20Trust%20A%20cross-country%20Comparison.pdf). \(pg. 8\)
1.3.9.2. Con: Correlation is not causation. The permanence of a monarchy may rather be a reflection of these countries' long history of [societal trust](http://hbanaszak.mjr.uw.edu.pl/TempTxt/Bjornskov_2006_Determinants%20of%20Generalised%20Trust%20A%20cross-country%20Comparison.pdf) and peaceful political histories, rather than its direct cause. \(pg.8\)
1.3.9.3. Pro: [A study](http://hbanaszak.mjr.uw.edu.pl/TempTxt/Bjornskov_2006_Determinants%20of%20Generalised%20Trust%20A%20cross-country%20Comparison.pdf) found that, under control conditions, populations in monarchies are approximately ten percentage points more trusting than in other, similar countries.
1.3.9.4. Pro: [Multiple](http://hbanaszak.mjr.uw.edu.pl/TempTxt/Bjornskov_2006_Determinants%20of%20Generalised%20Trust%20A%20cross-country%20Comparison.pdf) [studies](http://www.ifn.se/wfiles/wp/wp994.pdf) show there is strong, empirical support for the notion that monarchies have been able to create and sustain high levels of trust in society.
1.3.9.5. Pro: The social and political stability born out of the permanence of monarchy, as well that the unifying role and national conscience that monarchs play, are all possible explanations for their effect on [societal trust.](http://hbanaszak.mjr.uw.edu.pl/TempTxt/Bjornskov_2006_Determinants%20of%20Generalised%20Trust%20A%20cross-country%20Comparison.pdf)
1.4. Pro: Monarchy is an outdated concept.
1.4.1. Con: Being "outdated" isn't a negative in itself. Some old institutions are useful.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Many of the best universities in the world are very old, such as [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford) and [Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge).
1.4.1.2. Pro: Dismissing monarchy as "outdated" is an example of the [appeal to novelty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_novelty) fallacy.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Republicanism is not a new phenomenon, and in many ways is as old as monarchy.
1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Modern liberal republicanism is new compared to monarchism. Modern [liberal republicanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism#Enlightenment_republicanism) \(e.g., the first French Republic\) is vastly different from [ancient republicanism](http://science.jrank.org/pages/9964/Liberty-Ancient-Conceptions.html) \(e.g., ancient Rome\).
1.4.1.2.1.2. Con: Being "outdated" and being "old" are not the same thing. Some old institutions are useful, but outdated institutions are not.
1.4.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Being outdated implies something is bad because it has outlived its usefulness. Monarchies are not outdated and continue to provide vital functions, sot hey have not outlived their usefulness.
1.4.1.2.1.2.2. Con: Being outdated implies a sense of progress in human civilization. If something is outdated, then it is anachronistic in this line of progress. But, human civilization does not make progress, it only survives, so monarchies cannot be outdated.
1.4.1.2.1.2.3. Con: To be outdated is to lose validity, usefulness, legitimacy, standing, or some other sort of value specifically because of time or because of age. This is a fallacious argument which is just as fallacious as arguing that tradition is correct for the sake of tradition. Therefore to argue that monarchies should be abolished because they are outdated is fallacious.
1.4.1.2.2. Con: The appeal to novelty fallacy exists where someone claims something is good exclusively because it is new. This is different from saying that something is bad because it is outdated \(as opposed to old\).
1.4.1.3. Pro: The point of [empiricism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism#cite_note-3) suggests that the monarchy has survived the test of time.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: This is an example of an [appeal to tradition](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/44/Appeal-to-Tradition). Something existing for a long time does not mean it is good.
1.4.1.3.2. Con: [Empiricists disagree over this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism). Empiricism also emphasizes the role of empirical evidence in the formation of ideas, over the idea of innate ideas or traditions.
1.4.1.4. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.1.2.
1.4.2. Pro: Monarchy as a symbol of national unity equates national unity with kinsman ties and divine authority, both of which are outdated concepts contradictory to democracy.
1.4.3. Con: In many former monarchies, the President of the Republic has many similar functions to royals and yet the institution of the presidency is not deemed as outdated.
1.4.3.1. Pro: In Germany, a former monarchy, the [President](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Germany) has similar prerogatives to monarchs: he or she is the de facto executive and symbolic nonpartisan figurehead; has veto and emergency powers; has prosecutorial immunity and cannot be voted out of office.
1.4.3.2. Pro: When a monarchy is abolished, a monarch is just replaced with a person that does the same thing, with a different title and in a less meaningful and grand way.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: When a monarchy is abolished, the monarch is replaced by people who are elected as representatives of the people they rule. The fact that they perform similar functions is a reflection of the sovereignty of the people over themselves, instead of rule by a random, unelected, and unaccountable individual.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: Usually when a monarchy is abolished, elected people come from the oligarchy. Even in constitutional monarchies  this can still be the case, look at the example of the British Tory party.  It could be argued this is no more representational of the common people than the nobility and monarchy.
1.4.3.2.1.2. Con: Even in European [History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution), this is not always the [case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution). Often this creates periods of instability, turmoil and even conflict and war, the results of which have influenced the political landscapes of today.
1.4.3.3. Con: Presidents of a Republic hold office by [popular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Union_member_states_by_political_system) or [parliamentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Union_member_states_by_political_system) vote, and their political power rests upon the will of the People. By contrast, monarchs rule only by accident of birth, therefore even if they perform similar functions, they are not comparable in terms of being outdated.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Democratic values, although ancient, are not considered outdated.
1.4.3.3.1.1. Con: Subjective public perception doesn't alter the very real fact fact that democracy is just as old-fashioned and outmoded as monarchy is.
1.4.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Democracy may not an outdated model since the top 25 countries in the [Human Development Index \(HDI\)](http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/HDI) are all well-established democracies.
1.4.3.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: In continents with a lower overall development, like [Africa](http://www.accord.org.za/conflict-trends/link-democracy-development-africa/), out of the ten most democratic countries, only 3 are in the [Low Human Development](http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/HDI) while the least democratic ones, only 3 are above that level \(and two are actually the last ones\).
1.4.3.3.1.1.2. Con: Research generally supports that democratic principles are correlated with political stability, [human rights](https://www.beyondintractability.org/bksum/ghali-interaction) and the necessary conditions for a [prosperous economy](http://www.developmentreform.org/the-link-between-democracy-and-development/).
1.4.3.3.2. Con: Presidents only represent the people who vote for them. They are naturally divisive figures. They cannot represent all the people of the nation in the same way that an impartial, unelected person can.
1.4.3.3.2.1. Con: While monarchs may not be partisan in terms of politics \(or at least not publicly\) they are not impartial, they are the embodiment of a system that divides citizens by origin and that considers a specific lineage to be over the rest.
1.4.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.1.
1.4.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.5.
1.4.3.3.2.2. Con: Monarchs favour and defend certain religions to which their roles are bound, despite the fact that only some of their subjects identify with them. This religious favouritism is not uniting.
1.4.3.3.2.2.1. Pro: Monarchs have let their religious beliefs come in way of their duties in recent past.
1.4.3.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.2.1.1.
1.4.3.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.1.3.2.4.1.
1.4.3.3.2.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.1.3.2.4.3.
1.4.3.3.2.2.2. Pro: Protestant rulers often headed their own state churches.
1.4.3.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: Until [2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Norway#State_and_church) the constitutional head of [the Church of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Norway) was the King of Norway.
1.4.3.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: Sweden funded the Church of Sweden, its own national church in 1477: royals and elected officials could only profess this faith. Although laws gradually allowed religious freedom, it was not until 1951 that nationals could leave the Church without having to be part of another congregation, and it was not until 2000 that the State and the Church were formally separated \([Jänterä-Jareborg, p. 672](https://www.iclrs.org/content/blurb/files/Sweden.1.pdf)\).
1.4.3.3.2.2.3. Pro: The British monarch still holds the title 'Defender of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the [Church of England](https://www.royal.uk/queens-relationship-churches-england-and-scotland-and-other-faiths)'.
1.4.3.3.2.2.3.1. Con: The fact that the UK has a state religion is not seen as disuniting in the UK, which has strong [freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_the_United_Kingdom) of religion, and is one of the [most](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/13/uk-losing-faith-religion-young-reject-parents-beliefs) [secular](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/12/23/americans-are-in-the-middle-of-the-pack-globally-when-it-comes-to-importance-of-religion/) countries on Earth.
1.4.3.3.2.2.3.1.1. Con: While religion’s importance has decreased in the UK, similarly to other developed European and Asian countries,  the country is [not a secular state](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/21883918) as [Anglicanism](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/no-secularism-please-were-british-6917549.html) is embedded in state structures.
1.4.3.3.2.2.3.1.2. Con: The special status of the [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_the_United_Kingdom) \(Scotland and Wales\) and their links to the monarchy are discriminatory to other faiths that do not have the same recognition.
1.4.3.3.2.2.3.2. Con: As most EU democracies are laic \(or non confessional\) and have freedom of religion, the connection between the Monarch and the established Church is a ceremonial leftover with little substance: therefore citizens are free to practice any religion.
1.4.3.3.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: Even if we stipulate that the church should be disestablished \(an idea few UK citizens would agree with\), the monarch's connection to it is of no practical significance.
1.4.3.3.2.2.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.3.2.2.1.
1.4.3.4. Con: What matters is the legitimacy of the claim to power, not whether they perform similar duties. Monarchies are outdated because their flawed claim to legitimacy. Today, it is generally agreed that power derives from the consent of the governed.
1.4.3.4.1. Con: Monarchs do not have a legitimate claim because of the consent of the governed or because of the divine right to rule.  Monarchs have a claim to govern because they have legitimate claims to own large swaths of territory we call states/countries. Their ownership of land gives them the right to govern just as one's ownership of a house gives them the right to govern their own home, or just as the ownership of a car gives one the right to do as he wishes with his car.
1.4.3.4.1.1. Con: Monarchs own land because historically they were the ultimate rulers of a nation, and their claim to power was legitimized by God. If we nowadays consider that historical legitimization out-dated, the fact that they own land \(which steams from their historical [divine right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings)\) should also not be considered legitimate.
1.4.3.4.1.2. Con: In many countries what it was [Crown land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_land) is nowadays considered public land and in some cases owned by the State. Therefore, if royals are legitimate because they own land, but they do not own it anymore or their profits and management are carried by the State, then monarchs no longer have that legitimisation.
1.4.4. Con: Monarchies have been shown to be able to adapt to other government ideas and modernise to new times.
1.4.4.1. Pro: The United Kingdom is both a monarchy and a [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy#England_and_the_United_Kingdom) since the XVII century, gradually expanding [suffrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage#Dates_by_country) until today's universal suffrage. If the United Kingdom can have a balance of both monarchy and democracy, it means the monarchic institution can adapt and is not outdated.
1.4.4.2. Con: Through the adaptation monarchies have lost relevance as a governing force. There's no longer need for laws to acknowledge the modern monarchies.
1.4.5. Con: Republics aren't a 'modern' concept either. Both monarchy and republicanism have evolved from their ancient roots, adapting to fit modern values.
1.4.5.1. Con: Monarchy is outdated because its claim to legitimacy \(the [divine right of kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings)\) has been universally rejected as implausible and incompatible with present day democratic values. Republics may be old, but their claim to legitimacy, the "consent of the governed," has been near-universally embraced as recognized as the sole basis of governmental legitimacy.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.3.1.
1.4.5.1.2. Con: All regimes, everywhere, require "consent" i.e people living under them. Democracy is not a synonym for consent.
1.4.5.1.2.1. Con: When the public vote for a specific figure \(president, prime minister, member of the parliament, judge, etc.\) they are indeed showing their support and consent to allow that person to govern. That is not true for monarchies, whose claim to power is based on divine right and tradition, with no consultation involved.
1.4.6. Pro: The practice of [intermarriages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_intermarriage) between the same class can be traced to the Bronze Age. Until the 20th century, [royals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_descent) \(and nobility\) saw marriage along the same class as a political and economical alliance and a way to preserve the best possible genes in their [lineage](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blue%20blood). Currently, knowledge about genetics is more advanced and this primitive form of genetic selection is no longer needed and marriages, in general, are no longer used as a main tool for political strategy.
1.4.7. Pro: In the 21st century, with the [separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state) between church and state, the monarch's power emanates from national [constitutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy) rather than [divine legitimacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings).
1.4.7.1. Pro: In previous times monarchs derived the right to rule directly from the [will of God.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings)
1.4.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.3.2.2.2.
1.4.7.1.2. Pro: Roman Catholic rulers had their legitimacy supported by the [Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relations_between_the_Catholic_Church_and_the_state#The_papacy_and_the_Divine_Right_of_Kings).
1.4.7.1.2.1. Con: However, no current European monarchies are linked to the Roman Catholic Church anymore. The only exception is [Andorra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_monarchies), which is not technically a monarchy but a [diarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarchy), and has as Head of State a member of the Roman Catholic Church, the Bishop of Urgell, along with the French Prime Minister.
1.4.7.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.3.2.2.3.
1.4.7.3. Pro: The idea of monarchy is based on the idea of a chosen person, and the descendants of such. Since [science](https://phys.org/news/2007-05-theory-modern-humans-descended-small.html) has discovered we all have the the same [origins](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/science/ancient-dna-human-history.html), the claim of royal or older blood is invalid.
1.4.7.4. Pro: Societies today include many faiths, and many people have no religion at all.
1.4.7.4.1. Con: According to polls, Christianity is the largest religion in the EU, adopted by [72%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Europe#Eurobarometer_poll_2012) of its citizens.
1.4.8. Con: Royals are changing their behaviour to match the changes among their people and using their platform for good.
1.4.8.1. Pro: Many members of royal families now have regular jobs.
1.4.8.1.1. Pro: [Princess Beatrice](http://royalcentral.co.uk/uk/yorks/princess-beatrice-to-grace-the-halls-at-sony-pictures-22303) of York worked at an investment capital firm in London and later became a coordinating producer at Sony Pictures.
1.4.8.1.2. Pro: [Prince Harry](https://www.royal.uk/prince-harrys-military-career) served in the Army and was also deployed to Afghanistan.
1.4.8.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.2.1.1.1.2.
1.4.8.1.4. Pro: Prince Constantijn van Oranje-Nassau of Netherlands is a part of the international think tank, [RAND](https://www.rand.org/pubs/authors/v/vanoranje-nassau_constantijn.html).
1.4.8.1.5. Pro: Queen Margrethe II of Denmark is a renowned painter and illustrator whose [work](http://mentalfloss.com/article/66764/time-queen-denmark-illustrated-lord-rings) has been featured in many publications, like The Lord of the Rings.
1.4.8.2. Pro: Modern royal marriage rules have become lax and royals no longer marry other royals only.
1.4.8.2.1. Pro: Prince William married [Kate Middleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Duchess_of_Cambridge) in 2011. The two met while they were students at University of St Andrews in Scotland.
1.4.8.2.2. Pro: Prince Rainier III of Monaco married an American actress and Academy Award winner, [Grace Patricia Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Kelly), in 1956.
1.4.8.2.3. Pro: King Felipe VI of Spain married [Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Letizia_of_Spain), a journalist and news broadcaster, in 2003. The marriage was seen as a surprise because of her non-royal status, and also because she had been previously married.
1.4.8.2.4. Pro: Prince Albert II of Monaco married [Charlene Wittstock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlene,_Princess_of_Monaco), a former Olympic swimmer for South Africa, in 2011.
1.4.8.2.5. Pro: Prince Carl Philip of Sweden married [Sofia Hellqvist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Sofia,_Duchess_of_V%C3%A4rmland), a model and reality-TV star, in 2015.
1.4.8.3. Pro: Royals often do charity work.
1.4.8.3.1. Pro: Queen Elizabeth and Prince Harry responded with a funny [video](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-30/queen-joins-royal-invictus-games-challenge-to-obamas/7372828) to the Obamas' Invictus Games challenge after the latter posted a video of themselves on Twitter promoting the Invictus Games, an international sports event for wounded, disabled and sick military personnel and veterans.
1.4.8.3.2. Pro: The King of Sweden is patron of the country's ["Royal Technology Mission"](https://www.sverigesingenjorer.se/Global/Dokumentbibliotek/Student/RTM_intro.pdf) and often undertakes trips to engage his country in global technological developments.
1.4.8.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.8.2.
1.4.8.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.8.1.
1.4.8.4. Pro: After the Spanish royal family was criticised for superfluous expenditures in times of austerity, new King Felipe [cut his own salary](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/11407364/King-of-Spain-cuts-his-own-salary-in-austerity-drive.html) by 20% and made all royal salaries and expenditures public online to be more in keeping with the country's efforts to recover from a global financial recession.
1.4.8.5. Con: If monarchy is an outdated and/or incompatible with democratic values as an institution, the behavior of individual monarchs/royals is irrelevant.
1.4.8.6. Pro: During the economic depression in Holland, the then-queen, Juliana, chaired the [National Crisis Committee](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/princess-juliana-of-the-netherlands-549659.html) to help people suffering from the crisis.
1.4.8.7. Con: -> See 1.3.1.2.2.1.5.
1.4.9. Pro: In order to create a politically united Europe, it will be necessary for countries to adopt similar political systems and abolish monarchies.
1.4.9.1. Con: The European Union has never proposed any pro-presidency or anti-monarchy rules for its member states.
1.4.9.2. Con: The creation of a "politically united Europe" is not universally acknowledged as a necessity. In fact, many political parties represent the idea that countries should become more independent.
1.4.9.3. Con: All member nations of the EU must be run by Democratically elected governments with free-market economies.
The existence of a few hereditary Monarchies performing ceremonial and diplomatic duties has no bearing on whether a country can apply for membership or of the EU to effectively govern itself.
1.4.9.4. Con: So far, what unites European countries are democratic and free-market values. Therefore, as long as countries uphold those values, their preferred form of government is irrelevant.
1.4.9.5. Pro: Political unity is crucial for Europe to maintain peace and stability in a globalized world.
1.4.10. Pro: Monarchies are an imperial relic of an elitist past, a bygone age that has no place in the 21st century.
1.4.10.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.3.
1.4.10.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.7.1.1.2.
1.4.10.3. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.1.
1.4.10.4. Con: -> See 1.4.3.2.
1.4.10.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.
1.4.10.6. Pro: The British Queens's sovereign role in [Commonwealth realms](http://bmsf.org.uk/about-the-monarchy/the-monarchy/the-realms/) is a remnant of the British colonial Empire that prolongs the imposition of British power on other countries.
1.4.10.6.1. Con: The Crown is no longer imposed, and former colonies or Commonwealth realms are [free to revoke](http://www.britpolitics.co.uk/the-commonwealth-list-member-countries) it through legislature.
1.4.10.6.1.1. Pro: [18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_realm#Former_Commonwealth_realms) countries are no longer Commonwealth realms.
1.4.10.6.2. Con: Sharing the same governmental structure and being apart of the larger British Commonwealth under the reign of Queen Elizabeth gives a sense of brotherhood/sisterhood and stability amongst member states.
1.4.10.6.3. Pro: [Queen Elizabeth II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_realm) of the UK is still the Queen of Australia and New Zealand, amongst 14 others, which means that the pledge of allegiance in these countries must still be made to a distant monarch whose so-called authority stems purely from Britain's colonial Empire.
1.4.10.6.4. Pro: The Queen still appoints the countries' Governor-Generals, heads of state representative of the British ruler, who are responsible for carrying out the monarch's prerogative powers in these commonwealth realms.
1.4.10.6.4.1. Con: [Governor-Generals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-general) are nominated by the elected Prime Minister of these countries, much like would happen in a republic, and are bound by these countries' constitution. The appointment by the queen is purely symbolic.
1.4.10.6.4.2. Pro: In 1975 the Governor-General of Australia acted on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II and dismissed everyone in the Australian government after a [constitutional crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis).
1.4.10.6.4.2.1. Con: The key is "on her behalf". The Governor-General was in touch with UK seniors, but ultimately the decision to dismiss the Australian Government was his, not the Queen's. This is functionally no different to the role of a Republic's President.
1.4.10.6.4.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.6.4.1.
1.4.10.6.4.2.2. Con: In 1975, following the [Governor-General's dismissal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis) of the Prime Minister in Australia, the speaker wrote to the Queen to ask for her intervention. She replied reaffirming that the prerogative powers belonged with the Governor-General and as such she had no part in the decisions that he made.
1.4.10.6.4.3. Con: Governors-Generals rarely exercise real power on the instruction of the Crown.
1.4.10.6.4.3.1. Con: The Governor-General still must give [royal assent](http://www.gg.gov.au/governor-generals-role) to legislative bills before they come into force in Australia. While ceremonial in practice, this remains an important exercise of power and a necessary element for a functioning constitutional monarchy headed by Queen Elizabeth II in Australia.
1.4.10.6.4.3.2. Con: The Governor-General retains [reserve powers](http://www.gg.gov.au/governor-generals-role) which are important when, for example appointing a prime minister when there is a [hung parliament](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-08-23/australias-hung-parliament-explained/954880) in Australia. This involves convincing the Governor-General that they have sufficient support to command supply bills in parliament.
1.4.10.6.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.6.4.2.2.
1.4.10.6.4.3.4. Pro: In 1926, the Governor-General of Canada refused the request of the Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, to dissolve the parliament and call new elections. Mackenzie appealed to the British government to overrule the Governor-General's decision but the government [refused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%E2%80%93Byng_Affair), thinking it improper for them to interfere in Canadian affairs in such a way.
1.4.10.6.4.3.5. Pro: In 1953, the Governor-General of Pakistan dismissed the government of Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin. Nazimuddin tried to appeal to Queen Elizabeth, but the Governor-General's word stood and the Queen [refused](http://thediplomat.com/2016/03/when-elizabeth-ii-was-queen-of-pakistan/) to meddle.
1.4.10.6.5. Con: The UK no longer holds any [legislative power](http://bmsf.org.uk/about-the-monarchy/the-monarchy/the-realms/) over any other country.
1.4.11. Con: Monarchy has a historic and cultural value that should be preserved.
1.4.11.1. Pro: Monarchies often serve as potent cultural symbols extending beyond government, and are inextricably tied to the historical context of a country and its collective identity. To claim monarchistic institutions should be abolished without considering the complex cultural ramifications is short-sighted and potentially damaging to a country's cultural identity.
1.4.11.1.1. Pro: A monarchy serves as the highest assurance of stability for both institutions and inheritance; a constitutional monarch is a living embodiment to the respect for the law.
1.4.11.1.1.1. Con: Political stability does not inherently mean legitimacy.
1.4.11.1.1.1.1. Con: Political stability leads to economic growth, which is often connected to the [perception of legitimacy.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2582260)
1.4.11.1.1.1.2. Pro: Non-royal [dictatorships](https://planetrulers.com/current-dictators/) and other forms of non-democratic regimes are also [long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest-ruling_non-royal_national_leaders_since_1900) and stable forms of government and not inherently legitimate or good for its citizens.
1.4.11.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.1.2.3.
1.4.11.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: The [11 worst countries](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2017) in the world for political rights and civil liberties are or have recently been autocratic.
1.4.11.1.1.1.3. Con: Government instability can easily lead to a lack of rule of law and an increase in human rights violations.
1.4.11.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Research points that even if strong inequality is one of the main factors for conflict and violence, the longer and more [stable a democracy](http://www3.qeh.ox.ac.uk/pdf/crisewps/workingpaper81.pdf) is, the more equipped it is to avoid conflict and to strengthen the social contract.
1.4.11.1.1.1.3.2. Con: In long-established European democracies, the rise in political [instability](http://www.businessinsider.com/political-instability-in-europe-rising-2016-6) or even the [prolonged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Belgian_government_formation) lack of government have not recently lead to a weaker rule of law.
1.4.11.1.1.1.3.3. Pro: [Conflict](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1122271/) and war are more likely to occur in governments in transition than in established systems \(democratic or authoritarian\).
1.4.11.1.1.1.3.4. Pro: In times of [crisis](https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-system/Development-and-change-in-political-systems), the ability of political leaders, the effectiveness of government structures and their stability are key factors to avoid conflict.
1.4.11.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.11.1.1.1.3.2.
1.4.11.2. Con: The traditional values can be preserved without the royal family having any de facto power over the country. Be it as a merely honorary title or by the promotion of institutions with the intent of preserving the knowledge if those traditions.
1.4.11.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.
1.4.11.3. Con: Democracy has much more historic and cultural value.
1.4.11.4. Con: The sole historical and cultural value of a monarchy lies in its origins, which are not worth celebrating. Monarchs exist only because they managed to exercise violence against others and deprive others of resources. They claimed to exist by "Divine Right" as a means of stripping their subjects of rights.
1.4.11.4.1. Pro: A significant portion of the Crown Estate has its [origins in the Norman conquest](https://web.archive.org/web/20110903022316/http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/tce_faqs.htm) of the British Isles. William the Conqueror claimed [all land in England as his own](https://web.archive.org/web/20110901234303/http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/about_us/our_history.htm).
1.4.11.4.2. Pro: An extended war known as the [Reconquista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista) propelled the collaboration between Christian kingdoms in the Iberian peninsula. Much later, after the marriage between the [Catholic Monarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Monarchs), a significant portion of the wealth of Spanish royals was provided by the [colonial exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas) of native peoples.
1.4.11.4.3. Pro: As a means of preserving its control over the land and wealth of Ireland, the British monarchy allowed for [the summary execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tudor_conquest_of_Ireland#Solutions), without trial, of inhabitants. People without feudal lords were particularly susceptible to such execution.
1.4.11.4.4. Con: King Charles I,[in his impassioned speech](http://www.historyinanhour.com/2012/12/11/trial-and-execution-of-charles-i-summary/) at his show trial, defended the rights of his subjects by rightfully stating the case that if a king was not allowed  his rights and property, nobody else was guaranteed safety either.
1.4.11.4.5. Con: The Monarchy traces its origins back to the very first forms of statehood. If anything they should be credited for their ability to unify different warring tribes, provide security and stability of its citizens and for the very first beginnings of governance.
1.4.11.5. Con: Political systems change as cultural components change. Cultural and political transformation is a natural dynamic process.
1.4.11.5.1. Con: Change is natural, but is not a reason unto itself.
1.4.11.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.
1.4.11.6. Con: Countries that abolished their monarchies \(e.g. France\) retain a rich sense of their culture and history.
1.4.11.6.1. Con: The monarchy in France was abolished through uprising because the people were suffering because of it. When we abolish monarchy in peace time, this might have a very different outcome.
1.4.11.7. Con: Not all historical and cultural values and traditions are "good". The same logic could have been used to argue against abolishing slavery in the US or other parts of the world.
1.4.11.7.1. Con: We are talking about Europe, which is, with the USA, the most advanced continent in respecting human rights. This means that our traditions and cultural values have been tested by centuries of history and it also means that, for our continent, they're good \(or they would have been abolished by democracy\).
1.4.11.8. Pro: Monarchies have an influence on the arts and even on pop culture.
1.4.11.8.1. Pro: Monarchs in Europe now contribute to pop culture. One notable instance of royals involved in pop culture occurred recently. Megan Markle and Prince Harry’s wedding caused quite a stir because of the opulent ceremony.
1.4.11.8.2. Pro: Monarchies influence beauty and fashion standards, as well as art and architecture.
1.4.11.8.2.1. Pro: Different eras of monarchies, specifically the English monarchy, created new and different architecture styles. For instance, under the reign of King Henry VIII, the [Tudor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tudor_architecture) design was in style \(which is still used and adapted today.\) Next, the Victorian era, this era  developed the [Victorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_architecture) style which features a prominent facade. Due to Monarchies various architecture style that are quite notable and ornate have been developed .
1.4.11.9. Con: Culture precedes monarchs.
1.4.11.10. Con: According to [Immanuel Kant](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-12279627), an enlightened culture is one that does not rely on inherited traditions, authorities and social structures. To be enlightened is to question and challenge such aristocracies.
1.4.11.10.1. Con: All cultures rely on inherited traditions to some extent, even if only traditions of language and logic, etc.
1.4.11.10.2. Con: [Kant](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-social-political/#RepEnlDem) did not advocate the abolishment of monarchy per se; The philosopher solely highly pleaded for the separation of the executive power from the legislative power, and the rule of law.
1.4.11.11. Pro: Monarchies are repositories of tradition and continuity in ever changing times. In the swiftly changing currents of politics, they help remind a country of what it represents and where it came from.
1.4.11.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.7.1.1.2.
1.4.11.11.2. Pro: They provide comfort and nostalgia to people in a time of hyper-change and uncertainty.
1.4.11.11.3. Con: In France, the excesses of monarchy and the Royal Court contributed to the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution). Symbolically, the revolutionaries sent Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette to the guillotine.
1.4.11.11.3.1. Con: The situation in France before the French Revolution of 1789 can hardly be used as an example for contemporary European monarchies.
1.4.11.11.4. Pro: Royals play important roles at ceremonial events, either as embodiments of unifying values, or even constants that bring past, present and future generations together.[\(Elgenius, pg. 293\)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/16390523.pdf)
1.4.11.11.4.1. Pro: At ceremonies honouring people who have fought for their countries, the monarch's tribute and greeting of the parade are symbolically charged constants years on year.  [\(Elgenius, pg. 293\)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/16390523.pdf)
1.4.11.11.4.2. Pro: On National Days, it is often royal ascension that is celebrated as the symbol of the country's newfound independence.
1.4.11.11.4.2.1. Pro: The [Belgian National Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_National_Day) is celebrated on 21 July to commemorate Leopold I's royal appointment as first King of Belgium.
1.4.11.11.4.2.2. Pro: [Sweden's National Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Day_of_Sweden) is celebrated in honour of the election of King Gustav Vasa, representative of the start of modern Sweden.
1.4.11.11.4.2.3. Pro: Luxembourg's National Holiday is known as ['The Grand Duke's Official Birthday'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duke%27s_Official_Birthday).
1.4.11.11.5. Con: Traditions aren't always right or worth preserving, especially if they are harmful to the people and society.
1.4.11.11.5.1. Pro: Providing a 'repository of tradition and continuity' can be undesirable where the state \(and indeed the monarch\) has a history of, for example, colonialism and oppression.
1.4.11.11.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.6.
1.4.11.11.5.2. Pro: The [Succession to the Crown Act 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_to_the_Crown_Act_2013) reversed 300 years of discriminatory and biased tradition, custom and law of the UK. It gave daughters and sons of the royal family equal rights to become Britain's monarch and allowed future monarchs to marry Catholics.
1.4.11.11.5.3. Con: Not all aspects of tradition are wrong either. Modern European monarchies have been legally reformed to not hold any oppressive power, but they retain the symbolism and tradition that helps with social trust and cohesion.
1.4.11.11.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.9.
1.4.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.3.
1.5. Con: Monarchy is a stable form of government.
1.5.1. Con: Spain, a monarchy, faced 10 months of political instability in [2016](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/28/spain-to-get-government-after-10-month-political-impasse-mariano-rajoy) following two inconclusive general elections that failed to produce a government.
1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.1.1.
1.5.1.2. Con: In a highly fragmented democratic political system full of minor parties, it is very difficult to reach clear majorities. This is independent of the government form \(republic or monarchy\).
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Italy's profound social and political fragmentation [is historical](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/explaining-italys-fragmented-politics), as a result of geopolitics, unequal levels of economic development and being repeatedly invaded by foreign powers.
1.5.2. Con: After the 2010 elections, given the difficulty of generating sufficient alliances, Belgium, a monarchy, broke records by going [8 months](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/belgium-ndash-eight-months-with-no-government-2213128.html) without forming a government.
1.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.2.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.7.1.1.
1.5.4. Pro: A power other than a political, temporary majority maintains a division of powers. It is an important check on politicians.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Most monarchs are the sovereign source of executive power but legally devolve it to Parliament. This provides a check on the executive who acts in their name.
1.5.4.2. Con: The belief that monarchies act as checks on politicians is a dangerous one. Most monarchies' powers are purely symbolic, meaning governments face no constitutional backstop.
1.5.4.3. Con: If the monarch's role is politically important, the hereditary nature of their allocation is all the more worrying and undemocratic.
1.5.4.4. Pro: A monarchy can serve as a counterbalance to popular opinion.  Elected officials by nature are driven by polls.  A monarch is insulated from that influence to some degree.
1.5.5. Con: -> See 1.4.11.1.1.1.
1.5.6. Con: Monarchies are not inherently stable. For example, [monarchies elsewhere in the world are notoriously unstable](http://www.middleeasteye.net/essays/arab-monarchies-and-illusion-stability-7545029).
1.5.6.1. Pro: European [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession) shows that monarchies have been [overthrown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Austrian_Succession) [often](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_succession), inside monarchies has been turbulence and those have resulted quick changes in policy and foreign affairs. Current European monarchies are supported by democracy and those democracies are typically stable giving ilussion of monarchy is stable.
1.5.7. Con: Disputes within Royal families have been a major [contributor to wars](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world-war-1/457365/Royal-misfit-who-caused-The-Great-War).
1.5.7.1. Con: The reasons for many of the bloodiest wars in Europe were not related mainly to disputes within or between European royal families. One can consider World War I and World War II as two examples.
1.5.7.2. Pro: Many wars that ravaged Europe since the Middle Ages were due to disputes about monarchical [succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_succession#Europe).
1.5.8. Con: Modern European monarchies are not forms of government, but merely symbols.
1.5.8.1. Pro: In modern European countries there is no way for monarchs to influence the process of law-making.
1.5.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.5.8.2. Con: Symbols have power too.
1.5.9. Con: The stability of European parliamentary monarchies does not come from the monarchy, but rather the other governmental institutions.
1.5.9.1. Con: By a similar logic, one can argue that the stability of republics lays in a place other than the republican system itself - as, for instance, the degrees of social peace, social equality, democratic and civic culture of citizens, etc.
1.5.10. Con: Most European republics have also been stable forms of government.
1.5.10.1. Con: European republics are not stable given that the continuous change of parties in office is a form of instability. Under a republic, government officials never last long, and countries can be without government for a long time.
1.5.10.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.
1.5.10.1.2. Con: -> See 1.5.2.
1.5.10.1.3. Pro: Monarchy can bring stability to a country, when it has no government or specially between elections.
1.5.10.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.7.1.1.1.1.
1.5.10.2. Pro: The [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Fifth_Republic) Fifth Republic has existed since 1958, the Parliamentary Republic of [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Italy) since 1946 and the Federal Republic of [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Germany#Prior_to_1998) since 1949 \(with the unification in 1990\).
1.5.10.2.1. Con: Ever since Italy reconstituted itself as a republic in 1946, it has [churned through governments](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/04/economist-explains-8), each one lasting for a little more than a year on average.
1.5.10.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.2.
1.5.10.3. Con: -> See 1.5.10.2.1.
1.5.10.4. Con: The top three politically stable countries in [Europe](http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/wb_political_stability/) are monarchies: Liechtenstein, Andorra and Luxembourg.
1.5.10.4.1. Con: Liechtenstein, Andorra and Luxembourg are also [primarily micro-states](http://www.morality2.com/morality2/europes-microstates-showing-us-the-future-of-europe.html), so could be seen as 'oddities'.
1.5.10.4.1.1. Pro: These countries' limited human and natural resources have lead to the development of specific economic policies to make up for it, including extremely [low taxation](https://all-andorra.com/taxes-europe/) and openness to foreign investment.  These are likely to have contributed to the countries' stability to a greater degree, and cannot necessarily be translated to other monarchies in larger countries.
1.5.10.4.1.1.1. Pro: Andorra's [Corporation Income Tax](https://home.kpmg.com/xx/en/home/services/tax/tax-tools-and-resources/tax-rates-online/corporate-tax-rates-table.html) is 10%, while Liechtenstein's is 12.5% and [Switzerland](http://taxsummaries.pwc.com/ID/Switzerland-Corporate-Taxes-on-corporate-income)'s is 8.5%. All are much lower than Spain's 25% or Belgium's 33.9%.
1.5.10.4.1.1.2. Con: [Corporation Income Tax](https://all-andorra.com/taxes-europe/) in Luxembourg \(22.05%\) is higher than in The Netherlands' \(20%\).
1.5.10.4.1.1.3. Pro: [Standard VAT](http://www.uscib.org/valueadded-taxes-vat-ud-1676/) in Andorra \(4.5%\), Liechtenstein \(8%\), Switzerland \(8%\) and Luxembourg \(15%\) are all lower than in the UK \(20%\), Spain \(21%\) and Norway \(25%\).
1.5.10.4.1.2. Pro: Microstates form institutional relationships with larger protectorates to guarantee their political and economic viability; relationships that are dependent on the countries' [small size.](http://ams.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Microstates_OccasionalPaper.pdf)
1.5.10.5. Pro: In the last 20 years, most European countries, monarchies or republics, have been politically [stable](http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/wb_political_stability/): in politically stability indexes, except Greece, Croatia, Bulgaria and Spain, none of them have been [below](http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/compare-countries/) 0.
1.5.10.5.1. Con: Twenty years is arguably too short a time-span for measuring stability.
1.5.11. Pro: According to the global [political stability index](http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/wb_political_stability/) of the World Bank, 3 European monarchies are in the top 10 \(Liechtenstein, Andorra, Luxembourg\), 6 in the top 40 \(Norway, Sweden and Netherlands\), and all 11 in the top 80.
1.5.11.1. Con: It isn't a circumstance that these nations are in Europe, which is the second stablest and richest continent in the world \(after North America, if we consider it as a continent separated from South and Central America\). Even if in Syria there was a monarchy, it wouldn't be a stable country, due to war. This means stability isn't produced by monarchies, but by economic stability;
1.5.11.2. Con: -> See 1.5.10.4.1.
1.5.12. Pro: A monarch has a vested interest in a country's success since a country's well-being ensures the monarchy's survival.
1.5.12.1. Pro: Monarchs have a vested interest in the success of their reign and passing off a prosperous kingdom to their heirs.
1.5.12.1.1. Con: As regular citizens, elected officials also have a vested interest in the success of their governance, so they can enjoy a prosperous society and so they can pass on a prosperous country to their children.
1.5.12.2. Con: If the country’s well-being and the continuity of the monarchy are mutually exclusive, monarchs can still choose the option that perpetuates their ruling.
1.5.12.2.1. Pro: It is believed that [Edward VIII](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/uncle-who-encouraged-young-queens-nazi-salute-plotted-with-adolf-hitler-to-regain-throne-10398750.html) colluded with the Nazis to be made a “puppet monarch” in the event of an invasion.
1.5.12.2.1.1. Con: King Edward VII is not representative of all kings and queens of the United Kingdom, neither he is of royal heads of state in general.
1.5.12.2.2. Pro: Alfonso XIII King of [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_XIII_of_Spain) supported Primo de Rivera’s dictatorship and sent his son \(Juan, count of Barcelona\) to fight in the Spanish Civil War alongside Franco's Nationalist side.
1.5.12.2.3. Pro: Former Italian monarch supported [Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy)'s fascist regime while ruling. Fascism is generally considered to be an extremist form of government that is not good for the nation's common people.
1.5.13. Con: Citizens do not have the choice or freedom to withdraw support for an ineffective monarch through the ballot as in the case of a republic and have to resort to violent ways such as a coup, revolution or civil war to oppose the monarchy.
1.5.13.1. Pro: Monarchs are beholden to the social mores of the kingdom as well as to the spiritual realm. Historically, the result of a monarch who could not abide by these rules was often regicide. Therefore if the king didn’t listen to the people and the Pope, he was as good as dead.
1.5.13.2. Pro: [The Portuguese monarchy](http://www.unofficialroyalty.com/category/formermonarchies/portuguese-royals/) ended with the death of the King and his heir, followed by a military coup against the subsequent heir just two and a half years later.
1.5.13.3. Con: Violence is not the only way to remove a monarch from their position.
1.5.13.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.2.2.2.
1.5.13.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.2.2.
1.5.13.3.3. Pro: A perfectly legal and non-violent constitutional amendment could further limit the powers of an ineffective monarch.
1.5.13.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.2.2.8.
1.5.13.3.5. Pro: [In Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_institutional_referendum,_1946), a peaceful institutional referendum was held in1946 to bring an end to the monarchy.
1.5.13.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.11.3.
1.5.13.5. Pro: The strike against King Leopold III of Belgium is one of the most violent [general strikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Question#General_strike_and_abdication) in the history of Belgium and Belgium stood on the brink of civil war. It could have been avoided if a less violent and easier alternative to change the monarch was available to the people.
1.5.13.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.1.7.5.1.
1.6. Con: -> See 1.4.11.
1.7. Pro: Monarchy is fundamentally opposed to democratic principles.
1.7.1. Pro: Monarchies limit freedom of expression and speech by making criticism of the Crown or members of the royal family a punishable offence.
1.7.1.1. Pro: In [Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A8se-majest%C3%A9#Denmark), the monarch is protected by the usual libel paragraph \(Article 267 of the penal code which allows for up to four months of imprisonment\), but Article 115 allows for doubling of the usual punishment when a royal is target of the libel.
1.7.1.2. Pro: In [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A8se-majest%C3%A9#Netherlands), intentionally insulting the monarch is punishable by up to five years' imprisonment or a fine, while the same offense against the monarch's spouse, the heir apparent, the heir apparent's spouse or the regent carries up to four years behind bars.
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: A Dutch [activist](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/07/dutch-activist-faces-jail-for-royal-insult-under-19th-century-law) faced trial in 2015 after being accused of defaming the royals.
1.7.1.2.1.1. Con: [Charges were dropped](https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/geen-vervolging-in-fuck-de-koning-zaak~a4d5ab56/), therefore this is an obsolete argument.
1.7.1.2.1.2. Con: One application of these laws in decades just highlights how they are actually very rarely enforced.
1.7.1.3. Con: As of 2015, criticizing the Crown or royals is no longer considered a criminal offense in [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A8se_majest%C3%A9_in_Norway).
1.7.1.4. Con: These laws are barely used in today's time.
1.7.1.4.1. Pro: Section 3 of the [Treason Felony Act 1848](http://Section 3 of the Treason Felony Act 1848) has not been deployed in a prosecution since [1879](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/13/calling-abolition-monarchy-illegal-uk-justice-ministry).
1.7.1.4.1.1. Pro: [The Guardian's](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jun/26/pressandpublishing.themonarchy) legal challenge to the 1848 Treason Felony Act was dismissed by the House of Lords and ruled as unnecessary since the paper had published articles that espoused republican views, and had not been prosecuted.
1.7.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Even so, it remains in the statute book and there remains the possibility it could be used by the state to prosecute individuals for comments advocating for the abolition of the monarch.
1.7.1.4.1.2. Con: Statutes carry significant symbolic weight even if they are rarely used. For example, the ban on sodomy struck down in the United States Supreme Court decision in [Lawrence v. Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas) was rarely employed, but the Supreme Court recognized that it was significant nonetheless.
1.7.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.1.
1.7.1.4.3. Con: The Spanish satirical magazine El Jueves was fined after publishing an issue with a caricature of the Crown Prince Felipe and his wife engaging in sexual intercourse on the cover in [2007](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7092866.stm).
1.7.1.4.3.1. Con: One application of these laws in decades just highlights how they are actually very rarely enforced.
1.7.1.4.4. Con: In 2007 in the [Netherlands](https://web.archive.org/web/20110221124434/http://current.com/news-and-politics/88877763_dutch-man-jailed-for-insulting-the-queen.htm), a man was sentenced to one week's imprisonment and fined €400 for, amongst other things, lèse-majesté when he insulted Queen Beatrix.
1.7.1.4.4.1. Con: One application of these laws in decades just highlights how they are actually very rarely enforced.
1.7.1.5. Pro: In Sweden, the punishment of defamation or insult committed against the King or other member of the Royal Family is imprisonment for up to four years, or up to six years in the case of gross defamation \([Ch. 18](http://www.government.se/contentassets/5315d27076c942019828d6c36521696e/swedish-penal-code.pdf), Sec. 2 of the Criminal Code\).
1.7.1.6. Pro: In [Belgium](http://legaldb.freemedia.at/legal-database/belgium/?target=criminal-defamation-of-the-head-of-state), insult towards the King has a punishment of imprisonment from six months to three years and a fine, and insult towards other members of the royal family has a punishment of imprisonment from three months to two years and a fine. In addition, those convicted may be stripped of certain political rights according to the Belgian Criminal Code.
1.7.1.6.1. Con: These laws have never been enforced.  The king and his family are routinely attacked by the press, by politicians and by citizens. No one was ever arrested.
1.7.1.7. Pro: In [Spain](http://legaldb.freemedia.at/legal-database/spain/?target=criminal-defamation-of-the-head-of-state), slander or defamation directed against the King or a member of the royal family is a criminal offence under Article 490\(3\). The penalty is imprisonment from six months to two years if the offence is serious and if not, the penalty is a fine and imprisonment of six to 12 months.
1.7.1.7.1. Con: In Spain this can only be enacted if the insult is proven to be untrue, much like any defamation charge.
1.7.1.7.1.1. Con: The fact that it is a criminal charge rather than a civil charge makes it different to most defamation charges.
1.7.1.8. Pro: In [Monaco](http://legaldb.freemedia.at/legal-database/monaco/?target=criminal-defamation-of-the-head-of-state), publicly offending the Prince is punishable with imprisonment from six months to five years and a fine according to Article 26\(4\) of the Criminal Code. If not committed publicly, the act is punished with imprisonment from six months to three years and a fine. Similar laws exist for offending the family of the Prince.
1.7.1.9. Con: Laws prohibiting insult to the head of state aren’t limited to just monarchies and are also present in many republics.
1.7.1.9.1. Pro: Defamation of the German President publicly or through the media is a criminal offence under Article 90 of the [German Criminal Code](https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/criminal_code_germany_en_1.pdf). It carries a potential sentence of three months to five years in prison.
1.7.1.9.2. Pro: Offending the honor or prestige of the President of [Italy](http://legaldb.freemedia.at/legal-database/italy/?target=criminal-defamation-of-the-head-of-state) is a criminal offence under Article 278 of the Italian Criminal Code. The penalty is imprisonment from one to five years.
1.7.1.9.3. Pro: Insult or defamation against the President of [Portugal](http://legaldb.freemedia.at/legal-database/portugal/?target=criminal-defamation-of-the-head-of-state) is a criminal offense under Article 328 of the Portuguese Criminal Code. It carries a punishment of three months in prison or a fine.
1.7.1.9.4. Pro: Publicly insulting the President of Poland is a criminal offence under Article 135\(2\) of the [Polish Criminal Code](https://www.imolin.org/doc/amlid/Poland_Penal_Code1.pdf). The penalty is imprisonment for up to three years.
1.7.1.10. Pro: In the UK, Section 3 of the [Treason Felony Act 1848](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/11-12/12/section/3) makes it a criminal offence, punishable by life imprisonment, to advocate abolition of the monarchy.
1.7.1.10.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.4.1.
1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.
1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.1.3.
1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.1.
1.7.5. Con: Many people would argue that capitalism is also fundamentally apposed to democratic principles and yet capitalism exist in democratic societies.
1.7.5.1. Pro: Democratic principles are just a few of many values a citizen or country can hold.
1.7.5.2. Con: Whether something does exist or not is irrelevant to whether it should exist or not.
1.7.5.3. Con: Capitalism is fundamentally opposed to democratic principles, so capitalism should not exist in democratic societies.
1.7.6. Pro: There is a lack of transparency in monarchies.
1.7.6.1. Con: -> See 1.4.8.4.
1.7.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.3.
1.7.6.3. Pro: Royal families are granted protection from public scrutiny.
1.7.6.3.1. Pro: The British royal family is exempt from [the Freedom of Information Acts.](https://www.royal.uk/freedom-information)
1.7.6.3.2. Con: Spain's [transparency law](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-royals-idUSBRE93408620130405) does not exempt the royal family.
1.7.6.3.2.1. Con: However, unlike politicians, the [assets](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/world/europe/spain-abdication.html) of the Spanish Royal family have not been disclosed and are a “state secret”.
1.7.6.3.3. Pro: Senior politicians of the UK are sworn to secrecy on their communication with the royals when they take the [The Privy Council Oath](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/08/what-is-the-privy-council).
1.7.6.3.4. Con: Members of royal families have their every move closely followed by the world's media, which places them under immense scrutiny.
1.7.6.3.4.1. Pro: Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, was photographed topless while on a private holiday. The pictures, an infringement on Middleton's privacy, appeared in a [number of publications](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/topless-kate-middleton-photos-duchess-of-cambridge-trial-delay-may-closer-south-france-a7508836.html) all over the world.
1.7.6.3.4.2. Pro: Female members of the monarchy in particular are subject to the [media's commentary](http://www.independent.ie/style/fashion/fashion-news/queen-letizia-of-spain-opts-for-sunny-yellow-ensemble-on-first-day-of-state-visit-to-the-uk-35922827.html) of their choice of outfit and appearance, meaning they are under constant pressure to look a certain way.
1.7.6.3.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.2.2.
1.7.6.3.4.3. Pro: Prince William and Kate have been criticized for doing ["ordinary things"](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2544369/RICHARD-KAY-Wills-Kate-just-dull-celebs-says-former-BBC-defence-correspondent.html) like bending down and talking to kids.
1.7.6.3.4.4. Pro: Kensington Palace issued a [statement](https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/795931735443861504) about the media intrusion and harassment experienced by Prince Harry's girlfriend after the news of their relationship broke out.
1.7.6.3.4.5. Pro: In 1992, private telephone conversations between Diana, Princess of Wales, and a close friend, James Gilbey, were recorded and their existence was revealed by The Sun newspaper in an [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squidgygate).
1.7.6.3.5. Pro: Spanish journalists have claimed that there is freedom of speech except when it comes to the monarchy: many forms of censorship and self-censorship have made royals a taboo for many years \([Tremlett, p. 90](https://books.google.es/books?id=icmvfXyxMpoC&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=ghosts+of+spain+cebrian&source=bl&ots=hjpEJHYOPv&sig=F-mmddLs-p41RKIcsYYUP6NinPY&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5mrHf26fWAhUS22MKHVfHCI4Q6AEITjAN#v=onepage&q=ghosts%20of%20spain%20cebrian&f=false)\).
1.7.6.4. Con: [Transparency International's corruption perceptions index](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016) puts 6 constitutional monarchies inside the top 10 countries for their absence of corruption: Denmark, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Canada are all among the very best.
1.7.6.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.1.5.1.
1.7.6.4.2. Con: Even if there is a slight correlation between monarchies and corruption, that is not a definitive reason to argue democratic monarchies tend to be less corrupted than Republics.
1.7.6.4.3. Con: There is a correlation that may be explained by historical reasons: countries in northern Europe are generally perceived as less corrupt than countries in southern Europe, regardless of government form.
1.7.6.4.3.1. Pro: Northern [countries](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016) that are not monarchies like Finland, Switzerland or Germany are perceived as less corrupt while southern and eastern countries like Italy, Greece or Bulgaria are perceived as more corrupt.
1.7.6.5. Con: The British monarchy has published [annual financial statements](https://www.royal.uk/financial-reports-2015-16) since 2001.
1.7.6.6. Pro: A study comparing eight West European monarchies with two republics found that republics "offer greater budgetary openness" \([Matthijs, p. 263](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\).
1.7.6.6.1. Pro: Budget oversight is also strict in republics and only the UK and Denmark offer a similar level of oversight, while in the rest of monarchies there is no oversight at all or it is limited \([Matthijs p. 264](https://remco.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SJASS_Vol.13_No.2-123-144.pdf)\).
1.7.7. Con: Democracy is based on the important value of equality. Monarchy embedded in democracy embodies and creates institutional space therein for the value of tradition, family and cultural identity. Both therefore are necessary for good and balanced government.
1.7.7.1. Con: Cultural identity and tradition can be just as easily be vindicated through democracy, such as in the U.S.
1.7.7.2. Con: The values of "tradition," "family," and "cultural identity," are not essential elements of democracy. Therefore, even if a monarchy did preserve those values, it would still be incompatible with democratic values.
1.7.7.3. Con: All of these values can be preserved without a monarchy.
1.7.8. Con: Monarchy [helps to sustain](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11930839) the democratic process by mixing an apolitical power with democracy.
1.7.8.1. Pro: Monarchs can act as a consitutional boundary to the state, similar to the army in Turkey, and the consitution in the United States.
1.7.8.2. Con: Monarchies are inherently political as they are premised upon the political theory of [monarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchism).
1.7.8.3. Con: Monarchs in some democratic countries only allowed democracy when confronted with plausible threats of violence or supported undemocratic regimes.
1.7.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.12.2.2.
1.7.8.3.2. Pro: Carol II of [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_II_of_Romania#Reign_to_1938) supported the Nazi regime, passed anti-semitic legislation and evolved his government into a dictatorship.
1.7.8.3.3. Pro: The British [aristocracy](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/18/royal-family-archives-queen-nazi-salute), including [royals](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-british-royal-family-supported-hitler-and-the-nazis/5383589), and in particular Edward VIII, were sympathetic to the Nazi regime.
1.7.8.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.12.2.1.
1.7.8.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.4.1.
1.7.8.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.4.2.
1.7.8.3.6. Con: Republics can be authoritarian too and they can sustain regimes that are opposed to democracy. All former European communist regimes were republican. Also, Portugal, was a republican dictatorship for [nearly half a century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estado_Novo_\(Portugal\)), from 1926 up until 1974.
1.7.8.4. Pro: Monarchical systems may reduce the incumbency advantage a head of government might have when his or her position is combined with the position of head of state. Ceremonial tasks may endear one to the public in a way that is unrelated to substantive political positions.
1.7.8.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.6.
1.7.8.4.2. Con: In countries like France, where there is a [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France#Election) as Head of State and a [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_France), even if the President acts on ceremonial and representative tasks \(as many other heads of government also do in monarchies or republics\) his or her [political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-presidential_system) functions have a great [repercussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohabitation_\(government\)), so they are as partisan as any other elected politician and thus it is unlikely that representative functions mitigate that to a great advantage.
1.7.8.5. Pro: Considering that a monarch will reign during a long period of time, he or she will necessarily put the people's interests first, whereas any other politician will be more likely to be interested in power/personal interests.
1.7.8.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.4.
1.7.8.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.7.1.1.5.1.
1.7.8.5.3. Con: A elected official might be power hungry but his power is dependent on the will of the people through elections, therefore he will have to keep the people's perceived interests in mind. A monarch in a modern democratic European constitutional monarchy is able to just hang back, do an occasional pr-tour and accrue tax-free wealth paid for by taxation of said populace.
1.7.8.5.3.1. Con: In the case of the Royal Family of the United Kingdom the [evidence](https://the-british-monarchy.weebly.com/taxes.html) that they are [paid](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/world/2017/06/27/how-much-does-royal-family-cost-each-brit/UCpwJD6KgWPeVkw9IGKR1O/story.html) for by [taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_the_British_royal_family) is [disputed](http://www.thisisinsider.com/where-does-the-royal-family-get-money-2017-1) and open to [interpretation](https://www.quora.com/What-do-the-taxpayers-pay-the-British-Royal-Family-for) depending on your source and political or ideological leaning.
1.7.8.5.4. Pro: Re-election is not an issue to monarchs
1.7.8.5.5. Con: Monarchs can have personal interests as well, such as assets and privileges.
1.7.8.5.5.1. Pro: A monarch having interests that do not align with the interests of a country's people is more dangerous than a politician with self-serving interests since a politician can be voted out of office but a monarch cannot.
1.7.8.5.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.13.
1.7.8.5.6. Pro: Other forms of government can be prone to extremism due to politicians seeking to push their own agenda. For example, throughout [Europe](http://time.com/4504010/europe-politics-swing-right/) there has been a rise in far-right parties.
1.7.8.5.6.1. Con: -> See 1.5.12.2.3.
1.7.8.5.6.2. Pro: Republics such [Austria](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/22/world/europe/europe-right-wing-austria-hungary.html?_r=0), [France](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/marine-le-pen-concede-defeat-historic-massive-result-far-right-front-national-emmanuel-macron-french-a7723206.html), [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics_in_Poland) or [Hungary](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/hungary/11532818/Hungarys-far-Right-anti-Semitic-Jobbik-party-wins-its-first-by-election.html) have seen a rise in far-right extremist parties.
1.7.8.5.6.3. Con: Monarchies such as [Belgium](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085728_2085727_2085704,00.html), the [Netherlands](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085728_2085727_2085711,00.html), the [United Kingdom](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085728_2085727_2085734,00.html) and [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_Democrats) have also experienced a rise in extremism, proving that democratic monarchies are not immune to this trend.
1.7.8.6. Con: It is not factually true that monarchies can prevent elected tyrants, since the inception of [fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Fascism) in Europe occurred in Italy with the support of the then king.
1.7.8.7. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.
1.7.8.8. Pro: The monarch is a politically neutral figure who appeals to everyone and isn’t publicly partisan to any particular view.
1.7.8.8.1. Con: Although political neutrality of a monarch works in theory, that is not always the reality. Monarchs and members of the royal family often give up their positions of political neutrality and indulge in lobbying.
1.7.8.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.3.2.2.1.
1.7.8.8.1.2. Pro: Former King of Spain Juan Carlos meddled in politics and questioned a government minister about an [anti-hunting law](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1580429/Spanish-King-meddling-in-hunting-law-row.html) before it was approved by parliament.
1.7.8.8.1.3. Pro: Members of the British royal family have been known to indulge in politics directly.
1.7.8.8.1.3.1. Pro: Ministers have been forced to seek permission from [Prince Charles](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/30/prince-charles-offered-veto-legislation) to pass at least a dozen government bills from 2005 to 2011.
1.7.8.8.1.3.2. Pro: Queen Elizabeth II was actively involved in determining the appointment of [Prime Ministers](https://history.blog.gov.uk/2012/09/01/queen-elizabeth-and-her-twelve-prime-ministers/) in 1957 and 1963 when the leadership of the Conservative party became vacant between general elections.
1.7.8.8.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.
1.7.8.8.1.3.4. Con: It is not necessarily a bad thing for there to be a figure who gains political experience over decades, advises every Prime Minister, and yet has no direct political power and is forced to maintain a public stance of absolute neutrality. This can act as a useful long-view counterbalance to politicians who rarely see beyond the next election.
1.7.8.8.1.3.5. Pro: Members of the British royal family were [notorious Nazi sympathizers](https://www.sbs.com.au/guide/article/2017/08/28/brief-history-british-royals-and-their-alleged-nazi-connections); some members even passed national secrets to Germany during World War II.
1.7.8.8.1.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.12.2.1.
1.7.8.8.1.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.7.2.
1.7.8.8.1.3.7. Pro: Prince Charles took a [political](http://www.tibetanreview.net/prince-charles-to-continue-his-china-snub-on-tibet-issue/) and personal stance against China because of the country’s dealings with [Tibet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet) and his close friendship with Dalai Lama. He boycotted state visits to China in 1999 and 2005, and refused to attend a state dinner hosted by the Queen for the Chinese head of state in 2015.
1.7.8.8.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.12.2.3.
1.7.8.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.9.5.
1.7.8.8.3. Con: Monarchy is a fundamentally conservative notion.
1.7.8.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.
1.7.8.8.4. Pro: It's better to receive an award, medal etc from a monarch who has represented the country for decades rather than a career politician who represents their party; monarchs in contrast are non-partisan, reducing the alienation caused by the polarised nature of party-politics.
1.7.8.8.5. Con: Monarchs are necessarily political: they stand for their continued rule instead of an elected representative of the people ruled by their government.
1.7.8.8.6. Con: Monarchs do not necessarily "appeal to everyone": they stand in direct opposition to all people who believe in a republican or democratic form of government.
1.7.8.8.7. Pro: A monarch is not tied to any political party or interest group and therefore does not owe their position to a body of voters or the support of powerful interests.
1.7.8.8.7.1. Pro: An elected head of state requires help in elections and draws funding from donors that comes with strings attached. This makes a president biased in favour of groups that helped them attain office.
1.7.8.8.7.1.1. Pro: A republic can cease to be the guardian of the rights of all its citizens and become the privileged domain of one or another group of citizens.
1.7.8.8.7.1.2. Pro: Large campaign [donations](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/11/political-donations-corrupt-democracy-in-ways-you-might-not-realise) buy political access and favourable consideration in policy development and legislation.
1.7.8.8.8. Pro: Monarchy makes it possible for people who disagree radically about how the nation should be governed to share an object of affection by which the nation as a whole is symbolised.
1.7.8.8.8.1. Con: Many people who disagree radically about how the nation should be governed may disagree with the existence of the monarchy.
1.7.9. Pro: Monarchies are centralistic and territorial, thus work against efforts to distribute power better, within borders and outside.
1.7.9.1. Pro: Monarchies tend to favour centralized systems. Historically, power was concentrated in the monarch and, in modern times, power is exercised by a central government with the support of the monarchy.
1.7.9.1.1. Pro: The [House of Bourbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Reforms), the linage of present day Spanish monarchy and previously France, historically imposed a rule that was centralized and uniforming.
1.7.9.1.2. Pro: In Catalonia, where tensions between central nationalism and peripheral nationalism have escalated, with some citizens demanding independence for the region, the king [Felipe VI's message](https://www.elnacional.cat/en/politics/barcelona-forgive-felipe-speech_242790_102.html) after the [9-O referendum](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/01/dozens-injured-as-riot-police-storm-catalan-ref-polling-stations), was seen as a violation from his ceremonial and non-partisan role and a tacit legitimization of the central government.
1.7.10. Pro: Monarchy often hurts rights to personal expression of the monarch or the monarch's children \([universal declaration of human rights article 19](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)\) whereas e.g. in the Netherlands the monarch is not allowed to just say anything but has to discuss any public talk with a minister.
1.7.11. Con: Many democratic socialist countries, especially in Europe, provide services like free healthcare and free or state-funded higher education to their citizens and are also monarchies. Therefore not all monarchies are necessarily fundamentally opposed to democracy or even socialist values.
1.7.11.1. Con: Having a strong [welfare state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state#History_of_welfare_states), which can be understood as socialist policies, is a common denominator in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_social_model) since the XIX century. However, the values that monarchies interfere with, are not related to that, but to the primal aspects of [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy). That is, egalitarianism, equal opportunities to access elected positions and the possibility to chose those who fill those positions.
1.7.12. Pro: Monarchy are in most cases based on inheritance. That means kings and queens are not chosen by any merit-based or democratic-based systems. Therefore the selection is unfair and inefficient.
1.7.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.3.5.
1.7.12.2. Con: They might not be chosen by a merit-based system but through the system they are nurtured the necessary skills. So the merits that would have them elected are still in the monarch.
1.7.13. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.3.5.1.1.
1.7.14. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.3.4.
1.7.15. Con: As long as monarchs don't hold explicit political power, monarchy is not incompatible with democracy.
Such a monarchy can perform ceremonial and diplomatic functions in parallel to and at the behest of the sitting government without holding any influence over the democratic process.
1.7.16. Con: Even if one thinks that monarchies are wrong, they are so popular and entrenched that getting rid of them would waste political and activist energy that would be much better spent either on other campaigns or on trying to influence existing monarchies to be more supportive of progressive ideas.
1.7.16.1. Con: By that logic, any activism or campaign that was challenging and difficult to achieve would be better abandoned. That would make social progress and change really unattainable.
1.7.17. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.
1.7.18. Con: According to the [Freedom in the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_in_the_World) survey, all [European monarchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_in_the_World#Europe) are “free” and have high political rights and civil liberties ratings.
1.7.18.1. Con: Other European non-monarchies are just as "free" with just as high political rights and civil liberties ratings. The correlation does not necessarily imply that the Monarchy is the reason.
1.7.18.2. Con: The question is not whether the political conditions in countries that happen to have figurehead monarchs are free; rather, the question is whether having a monarchy is compatible with the principles of a free, democratic nation. A monarchy is not compatible with democratic principles.
1.7.18.3. Con: Many no-European monarchies \(such as the Emirates or Saudi Arabia\) aren't free, this means that freedom and political rights don't depend on having a monarchy as a form of government.
1.7.19. Pro: There is a lack of accountability in constitutional monarchies.
1.7.19.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.3.2.2.
1.7.19.2. Con: Most European constitutions give the Monarch some specific powers, such as veto powers, signing of laws, retaining the right to rule by decree in the event of democratic indecision, etc. However, true democracies have the ability to decentralize the power of monarch and provide a system of check and balances to their power.
1.7.19.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.1.
1.7.19.2.2. Pro: The judiciary can also act to limit a monarch's powers.
1.7.19.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.9.
1.7.19.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.9.
1.7.19.4. Pro: Monarchs are not elected.
1.7.19.4.1. Con: When the role is ceremonial, it would be a waste of resources to make monarchs votable.
1.7.19.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.7.19.4.2. Con: It is not a sufficient reason to abolish a system of government simply because an official is not elected. For that, it is necessary to demonstrate that an elected official makes a better head of state than a non-elected official.
1.7.19.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.1.1.2.
1.7.19.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.1.7.
1.7.19.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.1.1.
1.7.19.4.6. Pro: Monarchs are not held accountable to people through ballot boxes once they fail to become effective leaders.
1.7.19.4.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.13.
1.7.19.5. Con: -> See 1.5.4.
1.7.19.6. Pro: It is difficult to change leadership in a monarchy.
1.7.19.6.1. Pro: Monarchies do not allow the best leaders to rise to the top.
1.7.19.6.2. Con: The monarchs are the leadership only on paper, the actual leadership \(the democratically elected prime minister and leading parties\) is not difficult to replace.
1.7.19.6.3. Con: Monarchs can be forced out of their position if they lose the support of the public.
1.7.19.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.2.2.
1.7.19.6.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.1.7.6.
1.7.19.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.13.
1.7.20. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.1.
1.7.21. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.3.
1.7.22. Con: -> See 1.2.5.3.2.2.
1.8. Con: Monarchies are the best political systems in order to guarantee freedom and democracy.
1.8.1. Pro: Monarchs deflect a lot of public attention allowing the executive space to get on with the functions of state.
1.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.3.4.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Heads of state spend huge amounts of time on functions and state visits.
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.7.1.1.5.2.
1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.
1.8.4. Pro: A reigning European monarch is the ultimate proof of democracy, for the people are free to instruct parliament to abolish monarchy, upon which parliament would act, which is the ultimate expression of democracy.
1.8.4.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.10.
1.8.5. Pro: So-called "[Presidents for Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_for_Life)" achieve more easily power in countries without Monarchy.
1.8.5.1. Con: Most historic examples of "Presidents for Life" are not found in contemporary Europe and are definitely not found in actual democratic systems.
1.8.6. Pro: The monarch has the power to solve political crises and mediate between parties.
1.8.6.1. Con: This would cause a constitutional crisis, because the powers given to parliament preserve democracy.  Should the sovereign overrule the government, then they would become a dictator.  Therefore the powers can never actually be exercised, \(whilst maintaining a democracy\).
1.8.6.2. Pro: In a national crisis, when the people and the Parliament are in serious disagreement, the monarch of the UK can personally exercise their [reserve powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_power#Constitutional_monarchies) [without](http://royalcentral.co.uk/state/constitutional-monarchy-a-ceremonial-figurehead-or-the-last-line-of-defence-55742) the advice and consent of ministers.
1.8.7. Pro: Monarchy is a symbol of democracy and freedom for some countries.
1.8.7.1. Pro: The Dutch monarchy is associated with freedom from foreign rule: first from that of the French under Napoleon in the early 19th Century and later from Nazi Germany in 1945.
1.8.7.2. Pro: In the 70s, the [Spanish King Juan Carlos I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_transition_to_democracy) facilitated the transition from a dictatorship to democracy.
1.8.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.4.2.1.
1.8.7.2.2. Con: While Spaniards can appreciate what King Juan Carlos did for the country, this does not transform every citizen into a [convinced](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/08/spain-majority-referendum-monarchy) monarchist.
1.8.8. Pro: 6 of the top 10 countries listed in the [Legatum Prosperity Index 2016](http://www.prosperity.com/rankings) are European monarchies. The ranking is based on a variety of factors including wealth, economic growth, education, health, personal well-being, and quality of life.
1.8.8.1. Con: This information by itself is not sufficient. The actual percentage of monarchies in the full list is also needed. There is the extra complication that 4 of the 6 countries are under the same monarchy \(British Monarchy\).
1.8.8.2. Con: Correlation does not imply causation. There are a lot of historical and economic reasons, apart from having a constitutional monarchy, that explain why European constitutional monarchies are much richer and healthier than other countries.
1.8.8.2.1. Pro: The Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and the UK all have a [colonial past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_empire) that has contributed to their wealth and prosperity.
1.8.9. Pro: -> See 1.7.18.
1.8.10. Con: -> See 1.7.19.6.
1.8.11. Con: -> See 1.7.
1.8.12. Con: The monarchy of Liechtenstein has leveraged its financial power \(as owners of the principality's biggest bank and asset management fund\), to consolidate their political power and [sway public referendums](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18649156).
1.8.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.1.3.2.4.3.
1.8.12.2. Pro: In 2003, Prince Hans Adam threatened to move to Austria, along with his financial enterprise, if he was not awarded greater constitutional powers. His demands were [duly met.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18649156)
1.8.13. Con: Monarchies inhibit royals themselves from living freely.
1.8.13.1. Con: Heads of State can sometimes see their personal lives constrained by security issues or other circumstances, yet that is a small tradeoff if they are able to guarantee freedom for their people and a stable government.
1.8.13.1.1. Con: Royal Heads of State have stronger and arbitrary \(e.g. no freedom of religion or to marry freely\) limitations imposed into their lives compared with non-royal Heads of State.
1.8.13.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.3.4.
1.8.13.3. Con: A monarch can [Abdicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdication)
1.8.13.3.1. Con: Simply stating that a monarch can abdicate, assumes that any given individual, in any given situation, can be defined as always having a choice. Royal families are generally long and glorious lines of succession through a family tree, and the whole concept is steeped in tradition and pride. It is unlikely that an environment like that lends itself lightly to "opting out", or abdicating, as it were.
1.8.13.4. Pro: In order to be in line of succession, royals in some countries need to profess a specific faith.
1.8.13.4.1. Pro: In [Denmark](http://www.unofficialroyalty.com/current-monarchies/danish-royals/danish-royal-faqs/), the monarch has to be a member of the Lutheran Evangelical church.
1.8.13.4.2. Pro: Laws in Sweden still demand that royals profess “pure evangelical faith” \([Church of Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Sweden)\) and that any member of the Royal Family who does not will be excluded from the succession \([Nergelius, p. 43](https://books.google.es/books?id=vue3del4NAIC&lpg=PP1&dq=Constitutional+Law+in+Sweden&hl=sv&pg=PP1&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=former%20formal%20powers&f=false)\).
1.8.13.4.3. Pro: A member of the British royal family must be [in communion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_1701) with the Church of England and does not have the freedom to be of another faith.
1.8.13.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.3.2.2.3.
1.8.13.5. Pro: Most royals cannot marry freely.
1.8.13.5.1. Con: Spanish royals could not marry non-royals due to the Pragmática Sanción of [1776](http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/pragmatica.htm), yet the Constitution now establishes that they do not need the permission of the King or the Parliament to marry and remain in the succession line.
1.8.13.5.1.1. Con: However, the [Constitution](http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/pragmatica.htm) does establish that there must not be a prohibition by both the King and the Parliament on the potential marriage. If both opposed, according to the law, the marriage could not be celebrated.
1.8.13.5.2. Con: There is no legal barrier that keeps a British royal from marrying someone of a different religion or faith.
1.8.13.5.2.1. Pro: The Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701 that restricted succession to the British throne to only Protestant descendants of [Princess Sophia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_of_Hanover) were amended in [2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_to_the_Crown_Act_2013). Those who marry Roman Catholics are no longer disqualified from the line of succession.
1.8.13.5.3. Pro: To 'maintain the status of the royal house', the [1772 Royal Marriages Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marriages_Act_1772) decreed that all members of the UK royal family must seek permission from the sovereign to marry their person of choice. The sovereign has the right to object.
1.8.13.5.3.1. Con: [Succession to the Crown Act 2013](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/20/section/3/enacted) replaced the Royal Marriages Act 1772, according to which only the first six in line to the British throne need the Queen's consent to marry.
1.8.13.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.8.13.5.2.
1.8.13.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.2.2.8.
1.8.13.5.5. Pro: In [Denmark](http://www.unofficialroyalty.com/current-monarchies/danish-royals/danish-royal-faqs/), the monarch must have the Parliament’s permission to marry.
1.8.13.5.6. Pro: In [Sweden](https://books.google.es/books?id=vue3del4NAIC&lpg=PP1&dq=Constitutional%2BLaw%2Bin%2BSweden&hl=sv&pg=PP1&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=43&f=false), the heir needs the Government’s consent to marry, otherwise, they lose succession rights for themselves and their descendants.
1.8.13.5.6.1. Pro: It took seven years for Princess Victoria of Sweden to get her father and the Government's [consent](http://www.riksdagen.se/en/how-the-riksdag-works/democracy/the-constitution/) to be able to [marry](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/sweden/7805599/Swedish-royal-wedding-how-country-boy-Daniel-Westling-was-transformed-into-Prince-Daniel.html) a commoner, Daniel Westling, her personal trainer.
1.8.13.6. Pro: Most monarchs cannot express political opinions or participate in elections.
1.8.13.6.1. Pro: One of the monarch's roles in a constitutional monarchy is to be a non-partisan political figure that can act as a back-stop to constitutional issues. As such, expressing a political view would compromise their intended role.
1.8.13.6.1.1. Con: This role is true of all non-partisan Heads of State, not just monarchs.
1.8.13.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.8.
1.8.13.6.2. Pro: The sovereign of the UK cannot vote, as according to the British Parliament's [website](http://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-commons-faqs/elections-faq-page/), it is deemed unconstitutional for the monarch to vote.
1.8.13.6.3. Pro: The King of [Spain](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muyhistoria.es%2Fcuriosidades%2Fpreguntas-respuestas%2Fivota-el-rey&edit-text=&act=url) can legally vote, however, as he is the Head of State and should be neutral and be above partisan politics, he does not vote.
1.8.14. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.
1.9. Con: Monarchs are more effective political figures than elected executives.
1.9.1. Con: Monarchs are not chosen by their biological or genetic characteristics that make them better at politics, but just by accident of birth.
1.9.1.1. Con: From the moment they are born, monarchs are usually better trained and educated to deal with political affairs than most politicians.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: Belgium's Prince Laurent has a [history of unorthodox foreign meetings](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/08/belgiums-wayward-prince-faces-fine-after-unauthorised-chinese-party).
1.9.1.1.2. Con: Someone elected to run the country is likely to have extensive experience in politics and is therefore more qualified to run the country than someone with no previous governmental or direct political experience.
1.9.1.1.2.1. Pro: Before being publicly elected, most politicians spend years facing internal processes in which they have to demonstrate negotiating skills and charisma to rise within their parties.
1.9.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Theresa May, current British prime minister, is the [second](https://www.biography.com/people/theresa-may-071116) longest serving home secretary in more than 100 years and has held several positions within Parliament since 1997.
1.9.1.1.2.1.2. Con: It is just as likely that the people would elect a [demagogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) or an [inept individual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump).
1.9.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Unlike a monarch, a demagogue or inept can be voted out of office in the next election.
1.9.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: François [Mitterrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Mitterrand#Political_career), the longest-serving French president, was a successful strategist who combined different political influences: a conservative and Catholic upbringing, his time serving under the Vichy Regime, a participation in the Nazi resistance and a successful political career in the Socialist Party.
1.9.1.1.2.1.4. Pro: Before being elected \(1982\), former Spanish President [Felipe González](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Gonz%C3%A1lez#Early_life) became a member of the clandestine socialist party and was elected its Secretary General once. He had a decisive role during the Spanish transition to democracy and became a member of Congress \(1977\). In contrast, Spanish King Felipe VI had not had a comparable political background before becoming king.
1.9.1.1.2.1.4.1. Con: King Felipe VI also has a very distinct role to play in Spanish politics to the Prime Minister, and as such does not need to have the same level of political experience to undertake his job effectively.
1.9.1.1.2.2. Con: Standing for election and running a country are two highly different and disparate things, with no correlation or causation between them. A person skilled at looking popular and winning elections is not the same a person who is a good, effective and competent leader.
1.9.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Before standing for election, most politicians have been involved in politics \(local, regional, national\) for a long time, have gained experience and have been vetted by their peers. That is certainly a more qualified career than someone who is chosen to run a country based on birth rights.
1.9.1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: While popularity among voters gets a politician elected, before being a candidate politicians need to “[battle](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-23437111)” other candidates. For example, they may need to go through assessments processes and be approved by other members of their party, when they are deemed ready and experienced enough.
1.9.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: In the UK, Liberal Democrats and Conservatives go through [assessment processes](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-23437111) that are ardours and difficult as well as very professionalised and based on competency.
1.9.1.1.2.3. Con: Somebody with a history in public office may be more likely to have old political affiliations and therefore struggle to put the country's interests first.
1.9.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: The last Italian President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, was referred to as '[Re Giorgio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Napolitano)' \(i.e. King Giorgio\) due to his long history of involvement in Italian politics and subsequent dominance in the sphere.
1.9.1.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Giorgio Napolitano was a leading figure in the Communist party for[over 40 years](http://presidenti.quirinale.it/Napolitano/qrnw/statico/lingue/en/en-nap-biografia.htm), up until its dissolution.
1.9.1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Napolitano was [accused](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-idUSBREA191TC20140210) of plotting to bring down Berlusconi's centre-right government by holding meetings with Monti, the new appointment, before Berlusconi had been called to step down.
1.9.1.1.2.3.1.3. Con: [Napolitano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Napolitano) has overseen parties from both the left and right wings, as well as a cross-party coalition and received cross-party support for his election as President. This indicates that he could rule without party biases. He is regarded as a beacon of [stability](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-idUSBREA191TC20140210) by many.
1.9.1.1.3. Con: There is no meritocratic evaluation between someone born into a royal family who receives the best training and any other person who might receive the same. Therefore any superiority of a monarch due to training is presumed and cannot be tested empirically as in an election or other evaluation.
1.9.1.1.4. Pro: The diplomatic and ceremonial aspects of governing, which the monarchy performs, require a keen sense of tradition, history and familiarity with protocol. Nurture matters more than nature with regards to these qualities.
1.9.1.1.5. Pro: They spend many years observing the institution from the inside and therefore probably have a much better idea of the machinations of the post than most politicians do theirs.
1.9.1.1.6. Con: As most monarchs have ceremonial power, their training in many cases involves protocol, foreign languages and an overall view of political affairs but not real political skills.
1.9.1.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.1.1.2.1.
1.9.1.1.7. Pro: Politicians do not know since an early age that they will become the heads of their respective states, and are therefore not able to invest their time and resources to educate and prepare themselves.
1.9.1.1.7.1. Pro: At 18 years old the Spanish King Felipe VI swore allegiance to the Crown and was formally declared the [heir](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Felipe-VI). He has spent 28 years \(1986-2014\) expecting to be king and preparing himself for his royal role.
1.9.1.1.7.2. Con: Politicians may not know from birth what position they will occupy, but those successful in reaching positions of power must compete through the ranks over time. This time is spent garnering the knowledge, experience and preparation required to be deemed eligible for a position at the top.
1.9.1.1.7.2.1. Pro: A [large proportion](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university-degree-that-rules-britain) of politicians in the UK completed the PPE \(Politics, Philosophy and Economics\) undergraduate degree at Oxford.
1.9.1.1.7.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.1.1.2.1.
1.9.1.1.8. Pro: Monarchs are likely to receive an international education, attend the best schools and choose degrees related to their royal duties.
1.9.1.1.8.1. Con: Monarchs are not the only well-educated people in a country, and, especially in the case of higher education, it is hard to ensure they were capable or worthy of attending a prestigious university. Being who they are, it is hard, if not impossible, to believe they've been held up to the same performance and evaluation standards as their peers throughout their education.
1.9.1.1.8.2. Pro: The Spanish King Felipe VI has had an [international](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Felipe-VI) education, studying in a private school in [Canada](http://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/2014/06/20/lakefield-college-school-grad-crowned-spains-king), then graduating in Law in Madrid and studying an MA in International relationships in the US. He has also received training at each of Spain’s armed services.
1.9.1.1.8.3. Pro: Prince William took a two-year training programme in the [art of kingship](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1038961/The-Royal-Apprentice-Prince-Williams-year-training-programme-king.html) drawn up by the Queen and Prince Charles which included working in different Whitehall departments to get a better idea of how government works, private instruction from constitutional experts, and briefings by privy councilors.
1.9.1.1.8.4. Con: Politicians have also traditionally attended leading educational institutions - [75% of the UK's Prime Ministers](https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/ed-jones/these-figures-show-how-out-of-touch-uk-politicians-are-from-everyone-else) attended the country's top universities, Oxford and Cambridge.
1.9.1.1.8.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.1.1.7.2.1.
1.9.1.1.9. Con: The best politicians have had life experiences outside of politics.
1.9.1.1.9.1. Pro: German leader [Angela Merkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel) was a former scientific researcher and has a doctorate in physical chemistry before she became a politician. She has been Chancellor of Germany since 2005. She is regarded as a [great politician](https://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/time-person-of-year-angela-merkel.html) due to her long tenure.
1.9.1.1.9.2. Pro: Winston [Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill#Artist.2C_historian.2C_and_writer), two-times Prime Minister of the UK and regarded as one of the most influential leaders of the wartime era, was an officer of the British Army, an artist, a historian and a talented writer, awarded with the Nobel Prize in Literature.
1.9.1.2. Pro: Additionally, due to the extreme [inbreeding](https://owlcation.com/humanities/The-Habsburg-Jaw-And-Other-Royal-Inbreeding-Deformities-and-Disorders) of some royal [houses](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/16/interbreeding-royal-families-europe-genetic), leading to very small gene pools, genetic diseases have been problematic for monarchs.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: Modern royal houses have mainly married commoners in recent years. The [Duke of Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Prince_Edward,_Duke_of_Windsor,_and_Wallis_Simpson) famously married a commoner, the [Duke of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Prince_William_and_Catherine_Middleton) has married a commoner,  the [Prince of Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Charles,_Prince_of_Wales,_and_Camilla_Parker_Bowles) married a commoner \([two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Charles,_Prince_of_Wales,_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer) of them\), and [Prince Harry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Prince_Harry_and_Meghan_Markle) married a commoner.
1.9.1.2.1.1. Con: The fact that in recent years most royal families marry commoners, does not detract from the fact that for centuries, the level of [inbreeding](http://www.datasketch.es/october/code/nadieh/) between royals has been considerably high, even making royals more prone to genetic diseases.
1.9.1.3. Pro: There is nothing inherent in monarchy that makes monarchs more effective. Because monarchs are born into the position and not put there by merit, an insane, stupid, or incompetent monarch could come to power.
1.9.1.3.1. Con: Politicians are not put there by merit, but by popularity. Popularity does not equate to competence or qualification.
1.9.1.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.9.1.1.2.2.1.1.
1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.1.
1.9.3. Pro: It is impossible to concieve of an institution outside of the monarchy able to combine to the same measure grandeur and the delicate mix of neutrality and sociatal engagement necessary for the optimal performance of the ceremonial duties of the state.
1.9.4. Con: Modern-day European monarchies do not, and should not have extensive power. The governmental institutions of each country, which are accountable to citizens, notably through elections, wield political power.
1.9.5. Pro: European monarchs do not fuel anger against a certain part of the population for electoral purpose.
1.9.6. Con: Most of the suggested benefits of having unelected lifelong party-neutral political actors \(the royals\) could, in principle, be fulfilled through appointed positions based on merit rather than biological heritage, as it already happens in some political or judicial positions.
1.9.6.1. Pro: Judges in the UK \(and European democracies with analogous principles of [Judicial Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_independence)\), are appointed based on merit \(some with life long tenure\) and can exert a non-partisan influence on the application of law in the country which takes into account principle, rather than short-term political gain.
1.9.6.2. Pro: Crossbench life-peers in the UK [House of Lords](https://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/whos-in-the-house-of-lords/members-and-their-roles/diverse-experience/) are an example of life-long non-partisan political actors chosen based on merit, who influence legislation and can take into account the long term interests of the country.
1.9.7. Pro: The Crown, composed of various members, permits that the representation of the State is simultaneously present in different places. The King might be dealing with major items of the Governments' agenda while the Queen, Princes and Princesses are supporting cultural, diplomatic or social initiatives together with charity events, etc. The duties of the head of State can be organically shared multiplying the country's presence.
1.9.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.
1.9.9. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.
1.9.10. Pro: The monarch is a permanent diplomatic figure who is respected and appreciated.
1.9.10.1. Pro: The monarch carries out international public visits thus alleviating the elected Prime Minister or President from these duties and allowing them to run the country more effectively.
1.9.10.2. Con: There is nothing inherent in being a monarch that commands respect. Because monarchs come to power by accident of birth, they might be insane, stupid, incompetent, or have other bad personality traits.
1.9.10.3. Con: Whether a monarch is respected and appreciated is a subjective claim.
1.9.10.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.7.1.1.5.5.
1.9.10.5. Pro: The monarch is important for national business and international relations, as foreign spokespeople behave differently with a monarch than with a president.
1.9.10.5.1. Con: Usually the word of a president is held in higher regard since they actually represent their nation, people and parliament.
1.9.10.5.2. Con: Because many modern monarchs are largely symbolic and wield little power, their ability to negotiate treaties or deals with other nations is vastly limited.
1.9.10.5.3. Pro: When dealing with more autocratic regimes, monarchs [hold more sway](http://fortune.com/2013/04/30/the-business-case-for-monarchies/) in the minds of autocratic leaders.
1.9.10.5.3.1. Pro: The UK has [success in working](http://fortune.com/2013/04/30/the-business-case-for-monarchies/) with Gulf States when their royals act as diplomats.
1.9.10.6. Con: Professional diplomats can be better than a monarch.
1.9.10.6.1. Pro: French diplomatic service seems to be [the best in Europe](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-20218377), winning over British diplomacy.
1.9.10.6.2. Pro: Ambassadors have achieved a long and high level professional training specifically for that purpose.
1.9.10.6.3. Con: -> See 1.9.10.5.3.
1.9.10.7. Pro: Even former monarchs can play an important diplomatic role: for example, former Spanish King Juan Carlos is regarded as [the best ambassador](http://thediplomatinspain.com/en/el-rey-que-puso-espana-en-el-escaparate-mundial-2/) of the country.
1.9.10.7.1. Con: This does not mean that all monarchs will be good diplomats.
1.9.10.7.2. Con: Since his abdication, former King Juan Carlos I no longer has [official](https://elpais.com/elpais/2014/09/19/inenglish/1411127481_223850.html) duties: he is reported to have been traveling, resting, treating his hip injury, eating out and planning to create his own foundation and has barely been in official acts.
1.9.10.7.2.1. Pro: Juan Carlos I was [not invited](https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/06/29/inenglish/1498733179_194613.html) to the event celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the arrival of democracy in Spain. As the protocol dictates that it is the Head of the State who addresses Congress, the emeritus King had no official place.
1.9.10.7.2.2. Pro: His image has also [deteriorated](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/9949809/The-lonesome-king-of-Spain-how-Juan-Carlos-fell-from-grace.html) due to rumours of divorce and paternity claims. A 2017 scandal revealed that many years ago, the secret services paid large sums to an actress not to divulge a romantic affair.
1.9.11. Pro: -> See 1.9.1.1.
1.9.12. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.5.
1.9.13. Con: -> See 1.3.1.2.2.1.
1.9.14. Con: Monarchs undertake their roles out of duty or obligation, rather than a real desire or vocation to support their nation, meaning they may be less likely to dedicate as much time to their responsibilities.
1.9.14.1. Con: -> See 1.8.1.2.
1.9.14.2. Con: The monarch in a constitutional monarchy is not required to 'run the country'.
1.9.14.2.1. Pro: An understanding of the country's constitution and ceremonial practices are more important than applied political experience.
1.9.14.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.
1.9.14.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.7.1.1.
1.9.14.4. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.7.1.2.
1.9.14.5. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.7.1.3.
1.9.14.6. Pro: Prince Harry of the UK admitted that younger monarchs are reluctant to take to the throne but will do so [out of duty.](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/22/prince-harry-says-no-one-royal-family-wants-king-queen)
1.10. Con: The monarch is a symbol of national pride and national unity.
1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.10.2. Con: -> See 1.3.
1.10.3. Con: The monarch can be a symbol of problems, [bad behavior](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/15/spain-king-juan-carlos-hunting) and moral decadence.
1.10.3.1. Pro: Monarchies can potentially hinder the further positive development of a country if a large enough portion of the population is rather living in the glorious past of that monarchy instead of looking forward.
1.10.4. Con: A monarch cannot meaningfully signify national pride due to the fact that they have not earned anything they have been born into.
1.10.4.1. Pro: To take pride in the monarch on the basis of their representational function is to take pride away from those who actually worked to make the country; it is to have pride in the actions of others, hiding those actions behind those who parasite upon these working others. This is pretence on part of monarch and the one with pride.
1.10.4.2. Con: They often dedicate their lives to their nation, and act as diplomats/representatives to the country. They earn it this way, its their duty. This is not an easy job
1.10.4.2.1. Con: Monarchs may dedicate their lives to their countries, but they do not earn that through their hard work, as they get into that position by birth.
1.10.5. Con: The premise for monarchy is not meritocratic and therefore should not be a symbol of national pride or unity as it is not based on the individual contribution to society.
1.10.5.1. Con: Whether the monarchy should or should not be a symbol of national pride or unity does not change the fact that in many European countries and for many people, the monarch is indeed a symbol of national pride and unity.
1.10.5.2. Pro: Monarchies are by definition nepotistic so inherently bestow wealth, privilege, opportunities and status to individuals with no struggle/work or effort. Taking pride in monarchies is akin to taking pride in nepotism and social class snobbery.
1.10.5.2.1. Con: Monarchies have rewarded scientists, artisans, craftsmen and physicians for centuries for their skills, talents, service and their achievements for centuries. The [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society) was founded to reward scientists as well as encourage scientific research.
1.10.5.2.2. Con: Republics are not immune from nepotism. The USA has had political "dynasties" such as the Bushes, Clintons and Kennedys, who all practised nepotism in some format.
1.10.5.2.2.1. Con: However, despite the power of big families, their members have had a career in politics and when given a position of power they have generally done so by being elected by the public or within a political party. Royals, on the other hand, get that power only by being born.
1.10.5.3. Pro: There is no pride in a group of super privileged individuals whose purpose is to maintain some level of popularity. Descendants of a long line of descendants from some historic individual who did justifiably earn the position, but that was a long time ago. Just because someone \(in a position they inherited\) did a good job doesn't mean they did any better than any other would have done.
1.10.6. Con: Monarchs are symbols of oppression as they acquired their status by violent and immoral means, and maintained it through violence and indefensible concentration of wealth and power.
1.10.6.1. Pro: When the British monarch held absolute power, he \(or she\) could claim any land he \(or she\) wanted from conquered territories. This land became the primary source of the Royal family's wealth.
1.10.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.4.1.
1.10.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.4.3.
1.10.6.2. Pro: The Spanish monarchy [initiated, approved of, and maintained](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Spanish_Inquisition) the brutal Spanish Inquisition.
1.10.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.3.
1.10.6.4. Pro: Under [King James I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Catholicism_in_the_United_Kingdom#Ireland_under_British_control), Catholic worship was prohibited and Catholic priests were hunted down and executed.
1.10.6.5. Pro: A significant portion of the wealth of the Spanish royal family has its origins in [colonial exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas) of native peoples.
1.10.6.6. Con: Current EU monarchy's get their status from inheritance and there is not a single bit of violence involved.
1.10.6.6.1. Con: However, in many cases their ancestors did resource to violence to keep power. Therefore, current monarchs are inheriting those positions through historical violence.
1.10.7. Con: People who are opposed to monarchy do not take pride or feel a sense of national unity due to a monarch.
1.10.8. Con: There are plenty republics that have loads of symbols of national pride and unity. In France, the figure of [Marianne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne) is a symbol of pride and unity in the nation. More extreme examples can be found in [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_symbols_of_North_Korea). So it is not necessary to have a monarchy to generate 'unity and pride'.
1.10.9. Con: People can only take pride in what they agree with. If someone dos not support the concept of monarchy, then it cannot be a source of pride. Republicans would naturally have pride in the absence of monarchy.
1.10.10. Con: Monarchy is an obsolete way to define social identity, in fact none of the real social values within a society are shared between common people and the royals.
1.10.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.2.4.2.1.3.
1.10.11. Pro: Monarchs are able to grow emotional bonds with the citizens of a country, as citizens see their monarch being born, grow, reach the throne and die.
1.10.12. Con: -> See 1.4.3.3.2.2.
1.10.13. Pro: Monarchies provide an emotional and personal bond.
1.10.13.1. Pro: The death of a monarch is a unifying time as citizens can recognise death happens to everyone yet despite the personal demise, the monarchic institution lives on, linking the past, present and future of a country and withstanding the test of time.
1.10.13.1.1. Con: This can be equally applied to a good politician.
1.10.13.1.1.1. Pro: The assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy produced widespread national mourning.
1.10.13.1.2. Con: Historically, the death of a monarch has not always been a unifying time but the contrary.
1.10.13.1.2.1. Pro: The death of a monarch is not inherently unifying. The deaths of many monarchs led to civil war \(known as a "[war of succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_succession)"\).
1.10.13.1.2.2. Pro: The death of the viciously anti-Catholic Queen Elizabeth I was widely celebrated by British Catholics, who hoped that the next monarch would be less oppressive.
1.10.13.1.3. Con: A monarchy is not necessary to ensure continuity in a nation's history. Many European countries, like France, Greece, Germany and Austria no longer have monarchs, but their people can and do still have a national identity and a sense of historical and cultural heritage.
1.10.13.2. Pro: For example, in the [terrorist attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Norway_attacks) in Norway, the Prime Minister reacted with reason, calm and severity. However, the King [cried with the country](https://youtu.be/m5zh5_zOoSk) on National TV and expressed the sadness and compassion the country felt, while showing an ethical way forward. People expect reason and political calm from a Prime Minister or President, so they can't be an expression of what the country feels.
1.10.13.3. Pro: Especially with national disasters and emergencies when there are familiar strong comforting and resolute presences. In The Kingdom of the Netherlands  the Monarchs have been a great support with some national disasters, hugging people, crying with people, being compassionate. For [example](https://youtu.be/fxyxCJ6Oqd8), after the [Bijlmer disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Al_Flight_1862).
1.10.14. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.8.
1.10.15. Pro: Monarchs are important in multi-ethnic countries because the institution of monarchy unites diverse and often hostile ethnic groups under shared loyalty to the monarch instead of to an ethnic or tribal group.
1.10.15.1. Pro: The monarchy in [Belgium](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/25/news/a-boon-for-unity-smiles-almost-all-around-for-belgium-crown-princes.html?mcubz=0) is one of the few institutions widely accepted by both the Dutch-speaking Flemings in the north and the French speakers in the southern Wallonia region and the French-speaking enclave of Brussels.
1.10.15.1.1. Con: However, the former King [angered](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/9767228/Flemish-fury-as-Belgiums-king-links-separatism-to-fascism.html) Belgian Flemings when equating the Flemish separatist party to1930s fascism.
1.10.15.1.2. Con: The Belgium royal family, perceived as francophone, always had less [support](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2013/0720/Tongue-tied-monarch-Belgium-s-Philippe-faces-a-linguistically-split-country) in Flanders and King Philippe \(monarch since 2013\) has been [criticised](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2013/07/25/belgium-new-king/) for not honouring politically neutrality.
1.10.15.2. Con: Monarchy has no real bearing on how united or divided a country is. Events like royal weddings and jubilees may bring the country together momentarily, but they have no lasting impact.
1.10.15.2.1. Pro: The three European countries with the most active [separatist movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_separatist_movements_in_Europe#United_Kingdom) are Spain, Belgium and the UK - all monarchies.
1.10.15.3. Con: Unity is achieved by sharing a belief in a system, a form of government or a nation. This is not limited to monarchy.
1.10.15.4. Con: The existence of the British monarchy hasn’t stopped the push for devolution and even independence in [Scotland.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence)
1.10.16. Pro: Ceremonial processions draw large crowds of people wishing to glimpse the royals passing by and wave flags. This increases nationalistic feelings and pride in the country.
1.10.16.1. Pro: In England, the [Trooping of the Colours](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/17/queen-celebrates-birthday-trooping-colour-parade/) parade for Elizabeth II's 91st birthday drew large crowds to see the Royal Procession.
1.10.16.1.1. Con: Hanging used to draw large crowds. The size of a crowd has no relation to the societal value of an occasion.
1.10.16.2. Pro: In Denmark, crowds [gathered](http://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2016041830966/queen-margrethe-denmark-76-birthday-family-balcony/) to celebrate Queen Margrethe’s 76th birthday in 2016.
1.10.16.3. Pro: [Koningsdag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koningsdag) \(Queen's/King's Day\) is a national holiday in Netherlands, with large-scale celebrations such as concerts and special events in public spaces.
1.10.16.4. Con: Increased nationalist feelings are not necessarily a good thing.
1.10.16.4.1. Pro: Nationalism is a form of harmful social control, as it can shape the [collective behavior](http://bev.berkeley.edu/Ethnic%20Religious%20Conflict/Ethnic%20and%20Religious%20Conflict/2%20National%20Identity/Druckman%20nationalism.pdf) of groups. We should not encourage nationalism.
1.10.16.4.1.1. Pro: Citizenship is an arbitrary social construct that we use to conveniently organise societies, not anything with inherent moral importance.
1.10.16.4.1.1.1. Con: Citizenship indicates membership in a political community and participation in a national identity. These things are morally meaningful.
1.10.16.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: We share many relationships with other citizens of our country - we vote in the same elections, contribute taxes to the same government, and share a national identity. This is morally meaningful.
1.10.16.4.1.2. Con: The fact that nationalism can shape collective behaviour does not make it bad. Shaping collective behaviour can be very good if it makes people more cooperative and willing to help each other, as nationalism does.
1.10.16.4.1.3. Con: Nationalism is not necessarily a bad thing, as the shared sense of norms, mores, and identity that it gives citizens not only strengthens communities but helps to prevent feelings of isolation and anomie.
1.10.16.4.1.4. Pro: Nationalist feelings can create an 'us' and 'them' dynamic that [leads to hostility](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b5f3/de6ae6935476f5b97ab84e33f520ca0455c2.pdf) towards groups of people with different appearances, traditions or cultures.
1.10.16.4.1.5. Pro: Nationalism is [a harmful form of patriotism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/patriotism/#PatNat). While patriotism is a devotion to a particular place and a way of life one thinks best, but has no wish to impose on others, nationalism is accordingly aggressive.
1.10.16.4.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.10.16.4.1.3.
1.10.16.4.1.5.2. Pro: Aggressive German nationalism is viewed as having been a key factor in [causing both World Wars.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_nationalism)
1.10.16.4.1.5.2.1. Pro: In World War II, the Nazis sought to create a [Greater Germanic Reich,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_nationalism) emphasizing ethnic German identity and German greatness to the exclusion of all others by exterminating Jews, Gypsies, and other peoples in the Holocaust.
1.10.16.4.1.5.3. Pro: [Jingoism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/jingoism), a form of ultra nationalism, can lead to individuals thinking their country is always right and other countries are wrong which can lead to conflict and war.
1.10.16.4.2. Pro: National pride and unity are traits that when fostered excessively are also shared with the extreme far-right and often have harmful consequences.
1.10.16.4.2.1. Pro: Far-right parties have often supported monarchy and some monarchs have historically supported anti-democratic extremism.
1.10.16.4.2.1.1. Pro: The [Party for Freedom](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/world/europe/europe-far-right-political-parties-listy.html), a Dutch far-right, anti-Islam and anti-EU party, that among other ideas has proposed recording the ethnicity of all Dutch citizens, [supports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_Netherlands#Political_parties.27_standpoints) Queen Beatrix's attributions.
1.10.16.4.2.1.1.1. Con: As a populist party, the Party for Freedom has switched views often and advocated for the queen to be only a symbolic figure \(after the Queen criticised the party\). Among supporters, [republicanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_Netherlands#1990s:_Republican_societies_form) is higher \(29%\)  than among the rest of the population \(15%\).
1.10.16.4.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.12.2.2.
1.10.16.4.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.3.2.
1.10.16.4.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.3.3.
1.10.16.4.3. Pro: Increased nationalism can fuel an increase in populism, as [recently exhibited](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/02/in-europe-nationalisms-rising/) in European and US elections.
1.10.16.4.3.1. Con: Populism is not necessarily a bad thing
1.10.16.4.3.2. Con: Populism and nationalism function according to [different logics](https://www.greeneuropeanjournal.eu/populism-nationalism-and-transnationalism/); while one pits 'the people' against 'the elites', the other distinguishes between those that are in a nation against those who are not.
1.10.16.4.4. Con: Nationalism is used to promote national unity and is the [foundation of modern society](http://www.e-ir.info/2013/11/14/does-globalization-diminish-the-importance-of-nationalism/). Sharing values, customs and an identity with others is what enables people to exhibit social solidarity.
1.10.16.4.4.1. Pro: National identity is important to the lives of many people.
1.10.16.4.4.1.1. Pro: Nationalism makes people believe in something greater than themselves, or other groups they associate with.
1.10.16.4.4.1.2. Con: Nationalism can make people think they deserve better than other people due to no other reasons than the place they were born.
1.10.16.4.4.2. Pro: A nation is an abstract thing that symbolises a common language, ideals, purpose, identity and group.
1.10.16.4.4.2.1. Con: All nations are made up out of many different cultures and groups of people with different ideals.
1.10.16.4.4.3. Con: There's no such a thing as a national identity. There's no trait that's common to all the citizens of a nation. The very existence of such an identity is just a myth born in propaganda.
1.10.16.4.4.3.1. Con: This is debatable. A National identity can be focused on an object, a tradition, a shared common history, a common core set of values, beliefs or even just a core sense of camaraderie and belonging, thus a shared common identifier.
1.10.16.5. Con: Non-monarchical ceremonial processions have the same effect.
1.10.16.5.1. Pro: In France, [Bastille Day](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/bastille-day-2016-what-is-it-when-france-national-holiday-parade-say-in-french-a7136431.html) celebrates the start of the French Republic and all things French. It draws huge crowds all over the country and ceremonial processions in the take place in the presence of the President, rather than a monarch.
1.10.16.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.11.4.
1.10.17. Con: -> See 1.10.16.4.
1.10.18. Pro: Monarchs can unite a nation in the face of wars or invasions, mustering up a unifying allegiance that can inspire and motivate in times of conflict.
1.10.18.1. Con: Such inspiration defers from the actual practical and logical allegiances; it offers a veil to cover what one ought to be and would be fighting for. For example, in an invasion, one defends the country, the people, the things they own and care about. Placing royalty before these things skews good survival-based motivations and instead encourages servility and slavish mentality.
1.10.18.2. Con: People do not unite in the face of adversity because of a monarch — they unite because they have something good worth defending. The USA is one of, if not the most, militarily successful countries in history and it has never had or required a monarch.
1.10.18.3. Pro: [King Haakon VII of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haakon_VII_of_Norway) united the nation in resisting German invasion during World War II, even threatening to abdicate if the Norwegian government threatened to cooperate with the Germans.
1.10.18.4. Con: There is no reason to think that a republic cannot inspire the same feelings of allegiance.
1.10.18.4.1. Pro: There is no evidence suggesting that a monarch is more able to unite a people towards a common cause than an elected head of state. One would have to compare the performance of monarchs in modern times versus the performance of elected heads of state, or even dictators to be able to argue the point of superior performance of monarchs. Otherwise what are you comparing a monarch with? An anarchistic society without leadership?
1.10.18.5. Pro: In the UK, King George VI is said to have become a symbol of national resistance during World War II, frequently broadcasting speeches to [keep up citizens' morale](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=i3QNDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA102&lpg=PA102&dq=george+vi+symbol+of+national+resistance&source=bl&ots=rRiTvCUIGX&sig=kXNwksz4EOvZDpMLtioAwmCja28&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI16D-ocfVAhUmCcAKHUZxDX4Q6AEIQzAI#v=onepage&q=george%20vi%20symbol%20of%20national%20resistance&f=false). \(p.102\)
