Discussion Title: Should the US Recognize Palestine as a State?

1. The US Should Recognize Palestine as a State.
1.1. Con: The US should not support the two-state solution as it is not the best outcome for the region.
1.1.1. Pro: The obviously viable option is the continuation and mutual acceptance of the political status quo.
1.1.1.1. Pro: As of 2009, three quarters of Israelis found the continuation of the status quo at least tolerable and more than half acceptable or even desirable \([Irwin, p. 4](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)\).
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Given that Israelis are the group whom the status quo most advantages and privileges, their attitude towards the status quo should not weigh on the acceptability of the status quo.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: The Israeli public perceives the status quo as unsustainable in the long run: six out of ten Israelis believe that the current state of the conflict will ultimately pose a threat to Israel's security and existence \([IDI, p. 6](http://www.peaceindex.org/files/Peace_Index_Data_January_2016-Eng.pdf)\).
1.1.1.2. Con: The status quo has resulted in at least three wars fought in Palestine within the last decade alone. Specifically, the [Gaza War in 2008/9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_\(2008%E2%80%9309\)), [Israeli Operation 'Pillar of Defense' in 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Pillar_of_Defense) and the [2014 Israel–Gaza conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict) resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians and destruction of significant amounts of critical infrastructure.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: All these operations took place in direct response to major Palestinian attacks on Israel and its citizens, and therefore in response to attempts at protesting against the status quo. If both sides accepted the status quo, these kinds of military escalations would not occur.
1.1.1.3. Con: The status quo, including the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, and the continued construction of Israeli settlements, is against international law.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Israel's occupation of territories acquired during the 1967 war is against international law. Recognition of Palestine as a State will force America to take a stance on the occupation \([Ben-Naftali et al., p. 609](http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1299&context=bjil)\).
1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Israel has continued to build settlements in the West Bank which [entrenches](http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201702020143-0025370) its position in Palestinian territory. These settlements are also illegal.
1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: 70 per cent of \(Israel Administered\) [Area C land](http://www.btselem.org/area_c/what_is_area_c) - Palestinian land which is directly governed by Israel - in the West Bank is [off-limits for Palestinian construction](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/71A1FD027B82B40D852580EA0064468F) and development. This adds to the gravity of the crime.
1.1.1.3.1.1.2. Con: The verdict that settlements are illegal is more influenced by the general [unpopularity](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-illegal-settlements-myth/) of them rather than a close legal scrutiny.
1.1.1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Legal judgements of actors are often influenced by public perception. The general court of the EU, for example, took [Hamas](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/17/hamas-taken-off-eu-terror-blacklist) of the EU's terror list, arguing that the inclusion was not based on sound legal reasoning but media reports.
1.1.1.3.1.1.3. Con: Article 6 of the [League of Nations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/israeli-settlements-on-the-west-bank-are-disputed-not-illegal/2016/10/03/523c0196-872e-11e6-b57d-dd49277af02f_story.html?utm_term=.6bb3e2ac010c)’ 1922 Palestine Mandate encourages Israeli settlements west of the Jordan River. [Article 80](http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-xii/) of the UN Charter accepts this provision and carries it over into current international law.
1.1.1.3.1.1.3.1. Con: Palestine was never part of the UN trusteeship system and as such Art 80 does not apply here. The closest Palestine came to trusteeship status was the [unsuccessful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_trusteeship_proposal_for_Palestine) attempt by Harry Truman in 1948.
1.1.1.3.1.1.3.2. Con: Israel has not held itself [answerable to the United Nations](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/01/27/rogue-state-israeli-violations-of-u-n-security-council-resolutions/), the body which replaced the League of Nations, as such Israel expanding to fulfill instructions by an international body is simply a political talking point.
1.1.1.3.1.1.4. Con: Settlements are merely a [return](http://observer.com/2017/01/united-nations-jewish-settlements-arent-illegal-and-have-nothing-to-do-with-peace/) of Jewish settlers that were expelled by Arabs before 1947.
1.1.1.3.1.1.4.1. Pro: Settlements like [Gush Etzion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Etzion) or [Naharayim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naharayim) have been destroyed by Arab legions prior to 1948. Israel is merely rebuilding them.
1.1.1.3.1.1.4.1.1. Con: This does not make the initial construction of these settlements legal to begin with.
1.1.1.3.1.1.4.2. Con: This claim is at least partially not true, as the Jewish population in the whole of Historic Palestine in [1946 was 602,586](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248723811_Justin_Mccarthy_The_population_of_Palestine_population_statistics_of_the_late_Ottoman_period_and_the_Mandate_Institute_for_Palestine_Studies_Series_xxvii_242_pp) \(31%\). As of December 2015, [altogether over 800,000](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/18210#.VpK885scTIU) Israeli Jews resided over the 1949 Armistice Lines \(including east-Jerusalem neighborhoods\).
1.1.1.3.1.1.5. Pro: The International Court of Justice in its [Advisory Opinion](http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf) on Israel’s Separation Wall in 2004 reaffirmed the illegality of settlements \(p. 196\).
1.1.1.3.1.1.6. Pro: Israeli settlements are often built on [private](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112100482.html) Palestinian [land](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-settlements-vote-idUSKBN15L2F3) which is illegally acquired, often by evicting Palestinians from their homes. This reduces the land owned by Palestinians, narrowing the potential space that could be allotted to a future Palestinian state.
1.1.1.3.1.1.6.1. Con: In many instances Palestinians do not have legal title to the land.
1.1.1.3.1.1.6.1.1. Con: Historically, from Ottoman rule to the British mandate to Jordanian annexation, [registration of land ownership has been rare](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/04/24/401282811/clearing-the-tangled-path-for-land-ownership-in-the-west-bank); when undertaken, it has been done inefficiently. It is wrong to confiscate land from innocent Palestinians for the administrative failures of their previous rulers.
1.1.1.3.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: The World Bank noted that in one of their projects, only [7000 out of 22,000](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/04/24/401282811/clearing-the-tangled-path-for-land-ownership-in-the-west-bank) hectares have a land deed.
1.1.1.3.1.1.6.1.3. Pro: The Jewish settler group Nahalat Shimon was able to evict Palestinian families from their homes in [East Jerusalem](http://www.refworld.org/docid/4a82b72328.html) because they did not own titles to the land.
1.1.1.3.1.1.6.1.4. Pro: In cases where Palestinians are able to show land ownership, as around [Amona](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/09/israel--palestinian-struggle-against-new-amona-settlement.html), this obstructs further settlements.
1.1.1.3.1.1.6.1.4.1. Pro: Eventually, the settlement of Amona was removed because it was found to be illegal.
1.1.1.3.1.1.6.1.4.1.1. Con: Attempts to remove Israeli settlers from the small settlement of Amona resulted in [violent clashes](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/02/01/israel-evicts-west-bank-outpost-as-new-settlements-approved-day-before.html) and pressure for a [bill to legalize settlements](http://www.timesofisrael.com/facing-backlash-over-amona-jewish-home-leaders-vow-to-pass-legalization-bill/).
1.1.1.3.1.1.6.1.5. Pro: Land outside cities often don't have [land titles](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/04/24/401282811/clearing-the-tangled-path-for-land-ownership-in-the-west-bank). This makes Palestinian land outside of cities an easy target for settlement expansions.
1.1.1.3.1.1.7. Pro: Land taken by Israel through military requisition orders was declared [illegal](http://www.btselem.org/download/201007_by_hook_and_by_crook_eng.pdf) \(p. 22\) by the Israel High Court of Justice, yet these orders have not been stopped, nor has the land previously been seized returned.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8. Con: The settlements are legal because there is no form of occupation of the West Bank and so international law regarding occupations, the Hague and Geneva Conventions, do not apply.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1. Pro: Palestinian territories are not occupied, but [disputed territories.](http://www.webcitation.org/6Vo9QW33E?url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/FAQ/Pages/FAQ_Peace_process_with_Palestinians_Dec_2009.aspx)
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1. Pro: [Occupied territories](http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFA-Archive/2003/Pages/DISPUTED%20TERRITORIES-%20Forgotten%20Facts%20About%20the%20We.aspx) are territories captured in war from an established and recognized sovereign. As the West Bank and Gaza Strip were not under the legitimate and recognized sovereignty of any state prior to the Six Day War, they should not be considered occupied territories. Instead, they are disputed territories whose status is to be established through negotiations.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1. Con: Israel [did not pre-emptively attack](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/07/04/israels-attack-on-egypt-in-june-67-was-not-preemptive/) the Palestinian territories in 1967 - it was a deliberate invasion, with the intention to capture territory. Obtaining land via conquest is [illegal](https://www.britannica.com/topic/conquest-international-law) under international law.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1. Con: The 1967 war was a pre-emptive defensive war fought by Israel - it was forced to capture the Palestinian territories because the Arab nations posed a significant threat.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Palestinian [fedayeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen), or terrorists, [constantly attacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_attacks_against_Israeli_civilians_before_1967) Israeli citizens from the creation of the state of Israel to 1967.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Nasser [sent](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1961-1968/arab-israeli-war-1967) large numbers of troops to the Sinai Peninsula on the border with Israel as a provocation. He did so while threatening to destroy Israel, calling for preparations for the '[final battle in Palestine](http://www.sixdaywar.org/content/threats.asp)', a clear indication that he was about to wage war with Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Nasser [ordered](https://bbcwatch.org/2014/06/09/bbc-nasser-asked-un-peacekeepers-to-leave-sinai-in-1967/) the United Nations Emergency Force, stationed in Egypt to keep the peace between Israel and Egypt, to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula so he could send in his own troops.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Egypt had [closed](https://israeled.org/nasser-closes-straits-of-tiran/) the Straits of Tiran, blocking Israel's only supply route with Asia and stopping its main supply of oil from Iran, placing incredible pressure on Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The Syrian president [declared](http://www.sixdaywar.co.uk/timeline.htm) that it was time to 'move from defensive positions to offensive positions and enter the battle to liberate the usurped land', directly threatening Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Immediately before Israel struck the Arab forces, it was [surrounded](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/mf2017.pdf#page=43) \(p. 51\) by approximately 250,000 troops \(nearly half in Sinai\), more than two thousand tanks, and seven hundred aircraft. The Israeli army could not remain fully mobilised indefinitely; it therefore had no choice but to attack.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: The then Israeli Deputy Prime Minister, Yigal Allon, [believed](http://www.e-ir.info/2014/03/16/pre-emption-and-israeli-decision-making-in-1967-and-1973/) that “a single successful first strike by the Arab armies would be sufficient to dissect Israel at more than one point, to sever its essential living arteries, and to confront it with dangers that no other state would be prepared to face”. A first strike by Israel was a necessity.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Intelligence [collected](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol49no1/html_files/arab_israeli_war_1.html) by the CIA, and passed onto Israel, concluded that Israel's existence was not threatened by a potential attack from the Arab nations. In fact, President Johnson [told](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/07/04/israels-attack-on-egypt-in-june-67-was-not-preemptive/) the Israeli Foreign Minister, Abba Eban, “All of our intelligence people are unanimous that if the UAR attacks, you will whip hell out of them.”
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: Israel would not have had [time](http://www.e-ir.info/2014/03/16/pre-emption-and-israeli-decision-making-in-1967-and-1973/) to mobilise its reserve troops in case of a surprise attack, reducing its ability to defend itself against a first strike by the Arab nations.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.5. Con: The CIA [assessed](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol49no1/html_files/arab_israeli_war_1.html) that Mossad's claim about being outgunned by the Arab nations was a deliberate attempt to influence the US into providing military supplies, publicly committing to the defence of Israel, approving Israeli military initiatives, and placing more pressure on  the Egyptian President Nasser.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.6. Con: Both Israeli and US intelligence believed that the chances of Nasser striking first were [slim](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/opinion/how-the-kgb-started-the-war-that-changed-the-middle-east.html).
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.7. Con: Michael B Oren, the former ambassador of Israel to the US, has [stated](http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people5/Oren/oren-con4.html) that Nasser did not want bloodshed in 1967.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.8. Con: Yitzhak Rabin, a General at the time of the Six Day War and a future Prime Minister of Israel, [believed](https://avrammeitner.com/general-rabin-does-not-think-that-nasser-wanted-war/) that Nasser did not want war.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.10. Con: While a defensive war to destroy enemy military capabilities might have been necessary, there was no need to continue occupying the land after the war.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.10.1. Con: Without the occupation after the war, Jordanian forces might have taken back the land or a power vacuum might have destabilized the region, both of which would have posed a security risk for Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.11. Pro: It was only [after](https://thejewishnews.com/2017/05/31/jordan-not-attacked-israel-1967/) Jordan attacked Israel that Israel moved into East Jerusalem to defeat Jordanian forces.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.11.1. Pro: Israel tried to [keep Jordan out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_the_Six-Day_War#Jordan_joins_Egypt) of the war with Egypt. It did not want to fight a two front war.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.11.2. Con: Jordan was bound by a [mutual defense treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_the_Six-Day_War#Jordan_joins_Egypt) with Egypt. Israel's attack on Egypt triggered this. The war over West Bank was therefore no defensive one for Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.2. Con: In [1969](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/soc.culture.jewish/lYDoWGUbJfE) the President of the International Court of Justice Judge Schwebel rejected the notion that Israel is the illegal occupier because it acted in self-defense during the invasion.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.1.11.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.4. Pro: In 1966, Israel conducted aggressive [military operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samu_Incident) in the Jordan controlled West Bank, before the Six Day War.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: UN Security Council [Resolution 228](https://undocs.org/S/RES/228\(1966\)) classified Israel's actions as violation to the Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.1.5. Pro: Israel [attempted](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.783429) to actively conceal laws that it passed in order to effectively take over East Jerusalem: the Israeli Foreign Ministry told its ambassadors to refer to the annexation as 'municipal fusion', and ordered them to try to 'conceal' the laws.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.2. Con: The argument that the lack of a previous sovereign invalidates the description of the status quo as an occupation is known as the "[missing reversioner thesis](http://www.jurist.org/forum/2010/04/us-israel-standoff-over-settlements.php)". It is not backed up by legal opinions or the international community.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.2.1. Pro: The Fourth Geneva Convention states that occupying territory captured during armed conflict is illegal. Regardless of whether the Palestinian territories were ruled by a sovereign state prior to the occupation, as long as they came under the control of a state party to the Fourth Geneva Convention - in this case Israel - the Convention applies \([ICJ, p. 174](http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.3. Pro: The West Bank was previously under the control of Jordan, territory it had [annexed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordanian_annexation_of_the_West_Bank) after launching a war to [destroy](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/mf2017.pdf#page=43) \(p. 35\) Israel. This annexation was not recognised by the international community. Given the West Bank never belonged to a sovereign state, Israel cannot occupy it.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.2. Pro: Similar territories are [recognised](http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp470.htm) as disputed territories - 'disputed territories of Jammu and Kashmir' - yet only the West Bank is designated as an occupation.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.2.1. Pro: Kashmir, just like Palestine, was disputed from its very inception. The conflict's origins overlap conceptually.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.2.2. Con: Other disputed territories are disputed between states. The disputed status of Kashmir does not imply that India or Pakistan is not a state. Likewise, the disputed territories of the West Bank and Gaza are disputed between two states: Israel and Palestine.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.3. Pro: Under [UN Security Council Resolution 242](http://www.un.org/Depts/dpi/palestine/ch3.pdf) from November 22, 1967, Israel is only expected to withdraw "from territories", not from "the territories" or "all the territories" captured in the Six-Day War. [Negotiations](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-meaning-of-un-security-council-resolution-242) would therefore determine which portion of these territories would eventually become "Israeli territories".
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.3.1. Con: This is quibbling over [translation issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242#French_version_vs._English_version_of_text) and the absence of a definite article. The context of the passage, which refers to the inviolability of state sovereignty and territorial integrity, renders any interpretation but that of a full withdrawal unconvincing.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.4. Con: This implies that there is a dispute about the rightful ownership of the territory in question. Yet the legal situation is clear and has repeatedly been affirmed by international institutions and the international community. Outside of Israel, there is no dispute.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.5. Pro: None of the armistice agreements after the 1948 war created political borders; this task was supposed to be taken care of by later negotiations.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.5.1. Pro: The boundaries marked by the [1949 Armistice Agreement](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-egypt-armistice-agreement-1949) signed between Israel and Egypt after the 1948 war were simply indicative of where the Egyptian and Israeli armies were. This leaves the territories up for negotiation.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.5.1.1. Pro: The Armistice Agreement states: 'No provision of this Agreement shall in any way prejudice the rights, claims and positions of either Party hereto in the ultimate peaceful settlement of the Palestine question' \([Article XI](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-egypt-armistice-agreement-1949)\). The permanent status of the West Bank is still to be negotiated.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.5.2. Pro: The [armistice agreement](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/arm03.asp) with Jordan explicitly did not "prejudice the rights, claims and positions of either Party" regarding the Palestine question, and thereby left the territorial issue untouched. It was "dictated exclusively by military considerations".
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.6. Con: Courts refer to Palestine as occupied territory.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.6.1. Pro: In an advisory opinion the [International Court of Justice](http://www.unrod.org/docs/ICJ-Advisory2004.pdf) refers to the 'occupied territories'.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.6.2. Pro: In a 2004 ruling, the Supreme Court of Israel referred to Israel holding the West Bank since 1967 "in belligerent occupation" \([HCJ, p. 1](http://elyon1.court.gov.il/Files_ENG/04/560/020/A28/04020560.A28.pdf)\), and used the word "occupation" a further two dozen times.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.2. Pro: Neither Gaza nor the West Bank are under the control of a hostile army as required to be classified as 'occupied' by [Art. 42](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/ART/195-200052?OpenDocument) of the Hague Convention.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.2.1. Con: [50.4% of people surveyed in Palestine](http://www.pcpo.org/index.php/polls/124-poll-no-200) support a third Intifada \(uprising\) against Israel, suggesting the majority of the population sees the country as a hostile force, even if the IDF's military presence is accepted by the Palestinian Authority.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.6.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.2.3. Pro: The presence of Israeli military forces on the ground in the West Bank was agreed upon by the 1995 interim agreement in [Art. 10](http://www.unsco.org/Documents/Key/Israeli-Palestinian%20Interim%20Agreement%20on%20the%20West%20Bank%20and%20the%20Gaza%20Strip.pdf).
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.2.3.1. Con: The Palestinian Authority is [no longer representative](http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Suspended-democracy-for-Palestinians-468995) of the Palestinian people since elections have not happened for the past 10 years. In a democratic Palestine, Palestinians may have voted in support for revoking that treaty.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.2.3.2. Pro: The US ended formal 'occupation' in Iraq with an interim agreement in 2004 despite troops remaining in the country. \([Sharon, p. 4](http://jcpa.org/text/occupation-sharon.pdf)\). These troops were not 'hostile' anymore since their presence was agreed upon. This is analogous to the Israeli-Palestinian agreement.
1.1.1.3.1.1.8.3. Con: Israel's objection that the Conventions do not apply as Palestine is no 'High Contracting Party' have been dismissed by the International Court of Justice which clarified that this provision is intended to mean that the convention applies even if "the conflict met no armed resistance" \([ICJ, p. 8](http://www.unrod.org/docs/ICJ-Advisory2004.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.1.9. Con: Whole-heartedly embracing the two-state solution in advance of a workable peace deal is too extreme a remedy to make a point about illegal settlements when other remedies \(such as cutting off foreign aid to Israel\) would work just as well.
1.1.1.3.1.1.10. Pro: The UN Security Council [declared](https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12657.doc.htm) that Israel’s establishment of settlements in Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, had no legal validity, constituting a flagrant violation of international law and a major obstacle to the vision of two states.
1.1.1.3.1.1.10.1. Pro: Israel has consistently ignored [more UN Security Council decisions against it than any other country](http://www.haaretz.com/study-israel-leads-in-ignoring-security-council-resolutions-1.31971), emphasizing the illegal nature of their occupation of Palestine.
1.1.1.3.1.1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.1.
1.1.1.3.1.1.11. Pro: Israel’s confiscation of land, water, and other natural resources for the benefit of settlements and residents of Israel also violate the [Hague Regulations of 1907](http://www.eccpalestine.org/israels-obligations-as-an-occupying-power-under-international-law-its-violations-and-implications-for-eu-policy/), which prohibit an occupying power from expropriating the resources of occupied territory for its own benefit.
1.1.1.3.1.1.11.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.
1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Customary international law defines Israel's actions to constitute 'occupation' of those territories it conquered in 1967 and controls until today \([ICJ, p. 7](http://www.unrod.org/docs/ICJ-Advisory2004.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.8.2.
1.1.1.3.1.4. Con: The US does not have a history of basing its geopolitical strategy on emphasising international law.
1.1.1.3.1.4.1. Pro: The US invasion of Iraq was [illegal under international law](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/16/iraq.iraq).
1.1.1.3.1.4.2. Pro: The US' continued use of drone strikes in undeclared war zones are illegal in international law, and [may even constitute war crimes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/21/drone-strikes-international-law-un).
1.1.1.3.1.4.3. Pro: The US supports governments who regularly breach human rights, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey & The Philippines.
1.1.1.3.1.4.4. Con: Recognising Palestine could be viewed as a way for the US to divert attention away from more questionable parts of its foreign policy.
1.1.1.3.1.4.5. Con: Just because the US does not base its geopolitical strategy on emphasising international law does not mean it should not do so.
1.1.1.3.1.4.5.1. Pro: It is morally important for the U.S to do the right thing even if it does not have the best moral track record.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6. Con: Recognizing Palestine will directly benefit America.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1. Pro: Recognizing Palestine reduces the threat of terrorism for the US.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.1. Pro: The Palestine question allows secularist and Islamist interpretations of history to converge and form a common picture of the US as a foe \([Maksidi, p. 552](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3092172?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.2. Con: The threat that terrorism poses to the US is negligible. Since 2001, only [6 people per year](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/death-risk-statistics-terrorism-disease-accidents-2017-1?r=US&IR=T) were killed by terrorism, more than 10 times less than those killed by choking on food.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3. Con: Recognizing Palestine does not take away from the factors that usually motivate terrorism.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.1. Pro: Contemporary Islamic terrorism in the West is not committed by the victims of this conflict nor people who show particular sympathy to the actual victims. Terrorists use the plight of fellow Muslims and religion [merely as a guise](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/apr/13/who-are-the-new-jihadis) for already existing radicalization and nihilism.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.1.1. Con: Even if the plight of Palestinians is not the "true motive" behind the activities of terrorist organisations, these organizations can still use the plight of Palestinians as a recruiting tool or way to gain popularity among civilians.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.2. Pro: Even among Palestinian terrorists attacking Israel there is no uniform or at least common pattern of motivations. Nationalist and economic grievances alone are seen as insufficient factors for explaining their terrorism \([Moghadam, p. 87](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10576100390145215)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.2.1. Con: The Palestinian cause features [prominently](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/teaching-terror-how-hamas-radicalizes-palestinian-society) in Hamas propaganda used for radicalizing Palestinian youth.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3. Pro: Scholars [cannot point](https://news.vice.com/article/dont-ask-why-people-join-the-islamic-state-ask-how) to any unifying cause that motivates terrorism. In fact, many terrorists don't seem to have any particular reason for doing what they do.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1. Con: At the very least, the plight of the Palestinians vis-à-vis Israel is a contributing factor towards extremism far beyond these two countries.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.1.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of ISIS, has [invoked](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/palestine-still-key-to-stability-in-the-middle-east/) the Palestinian cause in his crusade against the Jews and Americans.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.2.1. Con: Despite this, ISIS has not directed any [attacks](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/25/world/map-isis-attacks-around-the-world.html) towards Israel as of 2016. This shows that Israel is not a primary target nor is the Palestinian cause a serious ideological motivation for the group.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Israel is the most militarily capable nation in the Middle East. Lack of attacks on Israel could be a result of its military might and close proximity acting as a deterrent.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The US and the UK have a world-class intelligence and security apparatus, yet still have been unable to prevent ISIS attacks in their countries. It is unlikely that Israel deters ISIS, rather that ISIS itself is not interested in attacking Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.2.2. Pro: US administration officials have admitted that the Palestinian conflict [increases](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/12/to-defeat-isil-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict-must-be-resolved.html) the appeal of ISIS recruiting tools.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.3. Pro: Many former senior CIA officials and military commanders - including General David Petraeus, the former Commander of US Central Command and former Director of the CIA - believe that the Palestine issue helps Al-Qaeda recruit more soldiers \([T. Hegghammer and co., p. 293](http://hegghammer.com/_files/The_Palestine_Effect_The_Role_of_Palestinians_in_the_Transnational_Jihad_Movement.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.3.1. Con: Al-Qaeda is [no longer](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/al-qaeda-irrelevant-since-bin-laden-s-death-1.1165060) a relevant threat to the US.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.3.1.1. Con: Al-Qaeda's hatred towards the US and their willingness to commit terror attacks makes them dangerous. As long as Al-Qaeda exists, it can become a relevant threat to the US again, even if it's not currently one.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.3.1.2. Con: Even if Al-Qaeda as an organization may have become irrelevant, the ideology, attitudes, and recruiting tactics that underlie it persist in other organizations.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.4. Pro: The statelessness and exile of many Palestinian Islamists led them to take part in transnational jihad, but more importantly act as ideologues for the jihadi movement \([T. Hegghammer and co., p. 294](http://hegghammer.com/_files/The_Palestine_Effect_The_Role_of_Palestinians_in_the_Transnational_Jihad_Movement.pdf)\). If a Palestinian state were to be established, Palestinian Islamists would have a state that they could go back to.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.4.1. Con: Available evidence does not suggest that Palestinians are overrepresented amongst transnational jihadi networks \([T. Hegghammer and co., p. 296](http://hegghammer.com/_files/The_Palestine_Effect_The_Role_of_Palestinians_in_the_Transnational_Jihad_Movement.pdf)\). This suggests that the Israeli occupation is not a decisive factor in motivating Palestinians to turn to militancy.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.4.2. Pro: Abdallāh ʿAzzām, known as the 'Godfather of Jihad' and responsible for spearheading the effort to bring Muslim foreign fighters to Afghanistan in the 1980's, was a Palestinian. He was a by-product of the Israel-Palestinian conflict \([Hegghammer, p. 353 and 363](http://hegghammer.com/_files/Hegghammer_-_%27Abdallah_%27Azzam_and_Palestine.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.5. Con: Regardless of whether the US recognises Palestine, it is unlikely to change their general support for Israel. This motivation would thus still exist.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.6. Pro: [Ramzi Yousef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramzi_Yousef), who was behind the World Trade Center attack in 1993, confessed that he felt guilty about the death his action caused to US citizens but was "overridden by the strength of his desire to stop the killings of Arabs by Israeli troops" \([Coll, p. 193](https://books.google.de/books?id=ToYxFL5wmBIC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=overriden%20by%20the%20strength&f=false)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.6.1. Pro: Yousef later said he chose New York City because of its large Jewish population, and in letters sent to newspapers before the attack he stated three demands, the first two of which were an end to all US aid to Israel and an end to US diplomatic relations with Israel \([T. Hegghammer and co., p. 289](http://hegghammer.com/_files/The_Palestine_Effect_The_Role_of_Palestinians_in_the_Transnational_Jihad_Movement.pdf)\)
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.7. Pro: One of the founding authors of Islamic fundamentalism, [Sayyid Qutb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid_Qutb), recognized US support for Israel as one of the components that turned the US from friend to foe \([Calvert, p. 91](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/095964100111535?journalCode=cicm20)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.7.1. Pro: Sayyid Qutb went on to [inspire](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/23/magazine/the-philosopher-of-islamic-terror.html) most Islamic fundamentalist groups, including Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.8. Pro: Osama bin Laden [has labeled](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bin-laden-palestinian-cause-prompted-9-11/) the Israel-Palestine conflict and struggle against the suppression of Palestinians as a central driver behind behind 9/11.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.8.1. Pro: In arguably its most important ideological statement, the “[Declaration of the World Islamic Front for Jihad against the Jews and the Crusaders](https://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm)” \(February 1998\), Al-Qaeda listed Palestine as number three on a list of reasons why jihad against America is justified \(after the US military presence in Saudi Arabia and the sanctions regime against Iraq\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.8.2. Pro: Bin Laden repeatedly mentioned Palestine in his speeches and interviews.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.8.2.1. Pro: Bin Laden's first public speeches in the 1980's advocated a boycott of American goods because of US support for Israel. Since then, Palestine featured in practically [every](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/03/osamabinladenstruepriorities) statement and interview by Bin Laden.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.8.2.2. Pro: In a [1997 interview](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article7204.htm), bin-Laden stated that he declared jihad against the US because of its "support of the Israeli occupation of the Land of the Prophet's Night Travel Land \[Palestine\]".
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.8.2.3. Pro: One of the first public statements of bin Laden in 1994 made it clear that Palestine was a central feature of his agenda \([Lawrence, p. 4](http://14.139.206.50:8080/jspui/bitstream/1/2603/1/Lawrence,%20Bruce%20-%20Messages%20to%20the%20World,%20The%20Statements%20of%20Osama%20Bin%20Laden.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.8.3. Pro: In an interview, Osama bin-Laden's mother highlighted that during his teenage years he was "concerned, sad, and frustrated about the situation in Palestine" \([Wright, p. 76](https://burocraufabc.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/aula-7-wright-2007-em-inglc3aas.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.8.4. Con: When US Special Forces raided Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan in 2011, they grabbed documents revealing internal debates about how the organisation should continue to [exploit](https://consortiumnews.com/2012/05/27/how-al-qaeda-exploits-palestine-cause/) the Palestinian cause in order to increase recruitment.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.8.4.1. Con: The argument that bin Laden opportunistically “exploits” the Palestinian cause is an implicit admission that the same cause was used to motivate recruits. There can only be opportunism if there is something to exploit.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.8.5. Con: Bin Laden developed contacts with Palestinian organizations only in the late 1990s as a side product of setting up a Lebanon connection with Usbat al-Ansar \([Benjamin & Simon, p. 192](https://books.google.de/books?id=IOoBZvdNrIkC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=%22Thus%20far%2C%20Hamas%22&f=false)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.8.5.1. Con: Formal connections are not the only way to signal the importance of a conflict. Bin Laden frequently referenced the Palestinian conflict as an important part of the organisation's cause.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.8.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.8.2.3.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.8.6. Pro: In his 1996 fatwa, bin Laden highlighted the 'Zionist-Crusader alliance' as a source for the suffering of the people of Islam \([bin-Laden, p. 2](https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/jaro2010/MVZ203/OBL___AQ__Fatwa_1996.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.8.7. Pro: Upon seeing Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount in 2000, he hurried Mohamed Atta, the pilot of the first plane that crashed into the World Trade Center, to accelerate their preparations for 9/11 \([NCTA, p. 18](http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/staff_statement_16.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9. Pro: Studies on Muslim terrorists in Western countries indicate that a central motive for terrorism is the perception that Islam is oppressed and mistreated by the West. Recognizing Palestine might be a step towards changing this sense of Western arrogance \([Kirby, p. 422](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10576100701258619); [Khosrokhavar, p. 154f.](https://books.google.co.kr/books?redir_esc=y&id=yGswAAAAYAAJ&dq=Suicide+Bombers%3A+Allah%E2%80%99s+New+Martyrs)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1. Con: Getting Israel back to the negotiating table is vital for any real change to occur in the situation of Palestinians.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.1. Con: US recognition would up the pressure on all parties to find a solution for the conflict. For example, the [UN Security Council](https://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sc11722.doc.htm) resolution that would have called for a swift Israeli withdrawal from the territories captured in 1967 would have passed if the US had supported instead of opposed it.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.1.1. Con: US recognition of Palestine's independence would not prevent the US from continuing to back Israel at the UN.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2. Con: Even if Israel did not follow suit and recognize Palestine, Palestinians would still see many benefits to US recognition.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.1. Pro: Palestine would be able to [directly participate](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rosyln-fuller/palestinian-statehood-the_b_978245.html) in international organizations such as the UN and the World Bank.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.1.1. Con: It is unlikely that participation in international organisations would have a notable effect on the political realities on the ground and the conditions under which Palestinians live.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.1.2. Pro: A majority of UN members [voted](https://www.rt.com/news/217975-unsc-palestine-statehood-vote/) in favour of supporting the establishment of a Palestinian state; it only failed in the UN Security Council when the US vetoed against it.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The General Assembly voted to grant Palestine [non-member observer State status](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43640#.WPalrFKZORt) at the United Nations in 2012.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.1.3. Pro: Direct participation in international institutions increases Palestine's lobbying power. For instance, if Palestine was a member of the World Bank, it could vote on the Bank's Executive Directors, influencing projects carried out in the West Bank and Gaza.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Even economic giants like China have a voting power share of merely [4.4%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank#Voting_power) at the World Bank and [6.4%](https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/memdir/members.aspx) at the IMF. It is unlikely that a Palestinian state would gain a voting power sufficient to have even the smallest of effects.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.1.4. Pro: Although Israel does not recognise Palestine, statehood would allow Palestine to appear before the International Court of Justice vis-à-vis other states to resolve any international disputes in a peaceful manner.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2. Pro: Recognition would allow Palestine the ability to [easily trade on an international level](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rosyln-fuller/palestinian-statehood-the_b_978245.html) and independently broker foreign investment.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.1. Pro: Being recognised as a state is likely to increase investor confidence.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Investor confidence depends on much more than simply relationships between states. It is not likely to improve as long as the region is perceived as unstable.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2. Con: The ability to negotiate trade agreements would be useless if Israel maintains its [blockades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip), as it is likely to do.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: If Israel continued its current policies, Israeli economic blockades and [draconian police controls](http://hir.harvard.edu/article/?a=2837) would likely remain in place post-recognition.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: Israel fears that a military withdrawal from the West Bank could lead to an [Islamist takeover of the area](http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/What-would-happen-if-Israel-withdrew-from-the-West-Bank-and-ended-the-siege-of-Gaza-442855), similar to what happened in the Gaza Strip.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Hamas has [stated](https://www.algemeiner.com/2014/10/08/hamas-envisions-west-bank-takeover-destruction-of-israel/) that if Israel were to withdraw, it would takeover the West Bank in order to establish an Islamic Caliphate in Palestine. Hamas aggression will likely increase significantly if this were to take place.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: From June 2004 to July 2014, 26 Israeli civilians \(four of them minors\) and two foreign nationals were killed in Israel as a [result of rocket and mortar fire](http://www.btselem.org/israeli_civilians/qassam_missiles) by Hamas. This will likely increase, or at the very least continue unabated, if Israel withdraws.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Hamas tends to attack Israel whenever it starts running out of money. It does so [strategically](https://warontherocks.com/2014/07/going-at-it-in-gaza-new-realities-in-an-old-conflict/), in an attempt to force Israel into a ceasefire agreement from which it can negotiate a form of relaxation on its borders to allow finances to flow in. Recognition of a state means lifting of the blockade, eliminating the need for Hamas to attack Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.3. Con: While Hamas makes [aggressive claims](http://www.timesofisrael.com/open-up-gaza-or-it-will-explode-hamas-threatens-israel/) about destroying Israel, this is little more than political rhetoric intended as part of a negotiation strategy known as the ['Madman Theory'](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb517-Nixon-Kissinger-and-the-Madman-Strategy-during-Vietnam-War/). This entails making your opponent believe you are willing to take unrealistic measures \(such as a war of annihilation\) in order to win, despite this being a bluff.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: Conceivably, Hamas could take over the West Bank/East Jerusalem and prevent access to Jews, as a form of reciprocity to [recent Israeli restrictions on Palestinians visiting Al-Aqsa](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/israel-limits-access-al-aqsa-compound-attacks-151009043215083.html).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.5. Pro: When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, it was taken over by Hamas, which then used the territory to launch [numerous missile attacks](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32053999) on Israeli civilian targets. The same would happen in the case that Israel ends it presence in Palestinian territory.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Hamas was [forced](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/11/hamas_in_gaza_how_the_organization_beat_fatah_and_took_control_of_the_gaza.html) to take over control of Gaza when President Mahmoud Abbas initially refused to surrender control of the government despite losing elections. This does not have to happen in the West Bank.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.6. Con: US recognition does not entail unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian territories.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.7. Pro: Hamas decided to [contest](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4844196,00.html) the upcoming municipal elections in the West Bank, indicating a clear interest in ruling the area.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.8. Pro: Iran has [pledged](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4676/hamas-west-bank) to turn the West Bank into a launching pad for attacks on Israel, and arm Palestinians in the West Bank.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9. Con: Israel [withdrew from Gaza almost overnight](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alon-benmeir/the-fallacy-of-the-gaza-w_b_6152350.html), with no coordination and no agreement with the Palestinian Authority. It can withdraw from the West Bank in a way that allows the Palestinian Authority, and international forces if necessary, to prevent Hamas from militarily taking over the new state.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.1. Con: The PA lacks the authority and resources required to effectively police and enforce laws in the West Bank if Israel were to withdraw.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.1.1. Pro: Palestine currently has no unitary security force. Fatah controls the Palestinian Security Services while Hamas has [de-facto created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Security_Services#The_Executive_Force) its own security force in the Gaza Strip.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.2. Pro: An uncoordinated withdrawal would significantly [raise](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR700/RR740-1/RAND_RR740-1.pdf) \(p. 115\) security costs for Israel as compared to a coordinated one.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3. Con: Coordinating a withdrawal that ends with the Palestinian Authority successfully retaining the West Bank could still mean that Hamas attacks during the withdrawal but is ultimately defeated, or that Hamas attacks some time after the withdrawal. Either of these scenarios would likely result in a lot of casualties.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1. Con: This one time casualty hit would likely be miniscule compared to the casualties resulting from the periodic invasions of Gaza by Israel, and the harms resulting from the occupation of the West Bank.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1. Pro: Israeli occupation leads to significant harms for the Palestinian people.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.1. Pro: The occupation limits Palestinians' access to health care.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The occupation has fragmented the West Bank into dozens of ‘islands’ separated by settlements, military zones and controlled roads. This restricts the ability of Palestinians to travel freely, reducing or complicating access to health care [\(De Goyet, 2015, p.6\)](http://www.who.int/hac/crises/international/wbgs/opt_field_assessment_health_conditions_1april2015.pdf)
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: There are restrictions on the movement of ambulances transporting patients to Jerusalem hospitals. In 2011, only 5% of Palestinian Red Crescent ambulances in the West Bank were allowed to enter Jerusalem, 95% had to drop off patients at the barrier to be transferred to ambulances with Israeli licence plates \(back-to-back\) \([WHO, p. 14](http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA66/A66_INF1-en.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Construction of the Israeli West Bank Barrier has [isolated](http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA66/A66_INF1-en.pdf) many Palestinian communities from medical clinics. 41 clinics have already been totally isolated. Some 450,000 Palestinians will be directly affected, and a further 800,000 indirectly.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.1.2. Con: An [insufficient budget](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/SForum/SForum2015/MahmoudDaher.pdf) allocation by Palestinian Authority to the Ministry of Health to purchase needed medicines is often the cause of poor health care. The Ministry of Health is currently in debt to pharmaceutical suppliers.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The Palestinian Authority allocates an annual budget based on its resources and the return of tax receipts. The Israeli government consistently [interrupts](http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2013/health-challenges-in-palestine) the flow of these receipts. In 2013, the Palestinian Authority cut its allocation for the Ministry of Health by 30 percent. There is little the Palestinians can do.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: Many Palestinians suffer [malnutrition-related diseases](http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA66/A66_INF1-en.pdf) \(p 11\) due to a of lack of access to food as a result of military barriers and movement restrictions. 1.7% of school students are underweight, 2.6% suffer from stunting and 7.3% suffer from wasting.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.1.4. Pro: The Israeli occupation has contributed to high rates of [mental health issues](http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA66/A66_INF1-en.pdf) \(p 19\) amongst Palestinians. The number of people treated in Gaza for psychological shocks and post-conflict disorders doubled November-December 2012, with 42% of them under the age of 9. An inability to access healthcare outside of Gaza or to let supplies inside can result in overburdening of existing medical facilities.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.1.5. Pro: Israeli Defence Forces have deliberately attacked [health workers](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/08/mounting-evidence-deliberate-attacks-gaza-health-workers-israeli-army/), [UNRWA Gaza shelters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Israeli_shelling_of_UNRWA_Gaza_shelters) and [hospitals](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/middle-east-unrest/another-gaza-hospital-hit-israeli-strike-four-dead-40-hurt-n161086). These attacks severely impair the ability of the Palestinian healthcare system to operate effectively.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.1.5.1. Con: However, all of these attacks happened during wartime; Israel does not attack Palestinian access to healthcare when it is not forced to.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.1.6. Con: Projects by Israeli organizations help Palestinians to improve their medical training and business development. The [Peres Centre](http://www.peres-center.org/our_work), for example, has extended life saving treatments to 12,000 Palestinian children.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.1.6.1. Con: Israel does not need to occupy Palestinian territories in order to let Israeli organisations operate in the region.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.1.7. Pro: Palestinians are [unable](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20415675) to leave Gaza to seek health care treatment unavailable in Gaza, and medical supplies are unable to cross the border because of the blockade.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2. Pro: Severe [human rights violations](http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories) occur under the Israeli occupation.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: The Palestinians have suffered brutal suppression under Israel in the two [Intifadas](http://www.vox.com/cards/israel-palestine/intifadas).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The second infintada also [led to significant suffering for Israelis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada), especially the civilian population that was frequently targeted by Palestinians.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: As the sources used point out, the Palestinians suffered far more than the Israelis did.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Suffering cannot by measured by the number of lives lost alone.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Both the [First Intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intifada#General_causes) as well as the [Second Intifada](https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/jcs/article/view/220/378) were direct results of Israel's occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Recognizing Palestine might be a step toward preventing this from happening again.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Even if the US recognizes Palestine, this does not guarantee that Israel will. Israel's Prime Minister [adamantly refuses to endorse](http://www.timesofisrael.com/while-refusing-to-endorse-two-state-solution-netanyahu-tells-trump-israel-will-not-annex-west-bank/) a two-state solution.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Netanyahu has claimed in a past [interview](http://www.vox.com/2015/3/19/8258515/netanyahu-palestinian-walkback) that he principally supports the idea of a Palestinian state but that he doesn't think it is currently capable of self-governing. This means that there is potential to convince him to support the creation of an independent Palestinian state.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Even if Israel remains stubborn, US recognition will likely provide hope to many Palestinians who were otherwise considering violence because they felt like they had no other choice. A reversal of its decade long policy on the Palestinian issue, in the face of Israeli opposition, will send a strong message of support to Palestinians.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Alternatively, increased hope against Israel may embolden more acts of violence.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: The US will still support Israel as a key strategic partner in Middle East; it is unlikely that Palestinians will think the act of recognising Palestine could lead to the destruction of Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.1.3.

1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.1.3.2. Con: He later [denied](http://news.asiaone.com/news/world/israeli-pm-denies-abandoning-two-state-solution) abandoning his commitment to the eventual creation of a Palestinian state. He claimed that the state could not be formed while the Palestinian Authority refused to recognise Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people and the Hamas militant group continued to control the Gaza Strip.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.1.3.3.

1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: The lack of progress in the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the absence of a determinate agreement have been [repeatedly](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/05/third-palestinian-intifada-on-way-or-already-begun) seen as a [potential cause](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/fear-of-a-third-intifada) for a Third Intifada.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: [More than half of Palestinians](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/676) support the return to an armed intifada.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: The support for a return to the intifada is only under the condition that less violent mechanisms don't work. An even [larger share](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/676) support peaceful ways of resolving the conflict.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: While the Intifadas were not entirely peaceful, they were met with overwhelming force from Israel, leading to significantly more [Palestinian](http://www.btselem.org/statistics/first_intifada_tables) deaths than [Israeli](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3694350.stm) deaths, thus further cementing the suppression of the former by the latter.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Comparative death totals say little about the morality of the various sides in a conflict. For example, in WWII, the [ratio](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-worldwide-deaths-world-war) of German to American deaths was 16 to 1.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.3.2. Con: Given its vastly superior military, Israel has the means to permanently suppress Palestinians. Thus, Israel actually demonstrates moral restraint by not exercising this option.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: Israel’s restraint may just be fear of the response by the International Community to such an inhuman action.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: Israel's numerous [controls, checkpoints and 'closed roads'](http://www.btselem.org/freedom_of_movement/old/copy%20of%20checkpoints) within the West Bank are [in breach of Article 13](http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/udhr_article_13.html#at14) of the UN Declaration of Human Rights which states that individuals ought to have the freedom of movement within the borders and a right to leave. This illustrates the severity of the harms imposed on Palestinians by Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Palestinians are denied entry to Israeli settlements and [are violently prohibited](http://www.btselem.org/topic/settler_violence) from inhabiting these areas, constituting a breach of Article 13, which explicitly forbids restrictions predicated on race and religion \([Human Rights Committee p. 9](https://www.nichibenren.or.jp/library/ja/kokusai/humanrights_library/treaty/data/HRC_GC_27e.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: The large wall running through parts of the West Bank, known as the 'separation barrier', has been [claimed by Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2004/02/22/israel-west-bank-barrier-violates-human-rights) to be an illegal impediment to Palestinians' movement.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.2.3.

Despite terror threats, Israel aims to allow the maximum freedom of movement possible.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.2.4. Pro: [Route 60](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/20/israel) is the main road which connects the northern and southern ends of Palestine. By placing blockades on it on the basis of vague terrorist charges, Israel [splits](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/18/world/middleeast/18westbank.html) up families, prevents access to vital jobs, and degrades Palestinians on a daily basis. This act is completely disproportional to the threat posed by local residents.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.2.5. Con: Article 13 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights allows for exceptions and Israel fulfills these conditions.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.2.5.1. Pro: Freedom of movement restrictions are permissible under Article 12 if they are a complete military necessity. \([Human Rights Committee p. 6](https://www.nichibenren.or.jp/library/ja/kokusai/humanrights_library/treaty/data/HRC_GC_27e.pdf)\)
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.2.5.1.1. Pro: The actions are necessary since violent attackers are hiding in civilian crowds. For example, a [bomb](http://www.haaretz.com/bomb-found-in-red-crescent-ambulance-1.49189) was found in an ambulance during a control at the fifth checkpoint.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.2.6. Con: These checkpoints are necessary to ensure the safety of civilians living in Israel, and are thus legal under [Art 12](http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/freedom_movement_definition.html) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.2.6.1. Con: Israel's controls are not explicitly necessary -  there are many other tools which Israel could use to protect its national security and safeguard public order. The most obvious of these would be withdrawing to its actual recognised borders and protecting these.

1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.2.6.4.1. Pro: In [Hawara](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.740789), the Israeli Defense Force blocked all but one road into the town leading to massive problems because of some 'stone-throwers'.

1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.3.4. Pro: Children born to Palestinians in East Jerusalem do not automatically receive residence rights but must apply for it in a procedure that is anything but certain \([Jeffris, p. 217](https://academic.oup.com/ijrl/article-abstract/24/2/202/1538062/Institutionalizing-Statelessness-The-Revocation-of)\). If rejected, children will be stateless.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.3.5. Pro: Naturalization as a tool to secure permanent residence rights requires East Jerusalemites to take an oath on Israel as a ‘Jewish and democratic state'. This is institutionalized racism as Jewish immigrants do not need to swear such an oath \([Jeffris, p. 220](https://academic.oup.com/ijrl/article-abstract/24/2/202/1538062/Institutionalizing-Statelessness-The-Revocation-of)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.3.6. Pro: The [Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Reduction_of_Statelessness) commits signatory states to reduce the incidence of statelessness. Israel has signed this multilateral treaty.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4. Pro: Israel's policies in the West Bank are analogous to the [Crime of Apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_of_apartheid#ICC_definition_of_the_crime_of_apartheid) as defined by the Rome Statute.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.1. Pro: A recent report commissioned by the UN has accused Israel of enforcing an ["apartheid regime"](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-report-idUSKBN16M2IN) on Palestinians.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.1.1. Con: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres [effectively distanced](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/un-israel-report-apartheid-palestinians-gaza-a7632336.html) himself and the secretariat from the document.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.2. Pro: Israel engages in the 'deportation or forcible transfer of population' within the West Bank.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Demolitions of Palestinian homes and structures have [reached a record high](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/71A1FD027B82B40D852580EA0064468F) in the West Bank in 2016.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.2.2. Pro: A [UN report](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/71A1FD027B82B40D852580EA0064468F) has accused Israel of mass evictions and forced relocation of Palestinians in the Zone C areas.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.2.3. Pro: Israeli authorities have been accused of [randomly acquiring grazing land](https://english.palinfo.com/news/2017/03/15/Permitted-for-Israeli-settlers-prohibited-for-Palestinians) in the Jordan Valley, and then using it for military exercises, or handing it over to Israeli herders. Once this land is acquired, Palestinians can no longer live on it or depend on it for subsistence, forcing them to relocate.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.3. Pro: Israel's oppressive tactics in the West Bank are an '[institutionalised regime of systematic oppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_of_apartheid#ICC_definition_of_the_crime_of_apartheid) and domination by one racial group \(Jews\) over any other racial group \(Palestinians\) committed with the intention of maintaining that regime'.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.3.1. Pro: The West Bank has separate legal codes whose application is based largely on race and religion. These laws solidify the dominance of one racial group over another.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: Israeli settlers in the West Bank are subject to civil law, while Palestinians are subject to [harsh military orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Military_Order).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.4. Pro: Israeli security forces have carried out extra-judicial killings of Palestinians, even when they no longer pose any threat.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.4.1. Pro: Amnesty International [has accused Israel](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/09/israel-opt-pattern-of-unlawful-killings-reveals-shocking-disregard-for-human-life/) of unlawful killings of Palestinians in the West Bank and says they have a "shocking disregard" for human life.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.4.2. Pro: Israel often initially claims that dead Palestinian civilians were armed/posed a threat, even when [later evidence](https://theintercept.com/2016/06/06/two-wounded-palestinians-executed-hebron-not-one-witnesses-say/) proves this was not the case.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.5. Pro: Figures who have experienced Apartheid in the past have said Israel's conduct in the West Bank is similar to Apartheid.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.5.1. Pro: [34 South African activists](https://mronline.org/2008/05/19/apartheid190508-html/), including government ministers, published an open letter saying "We fought apartheid; we see no reason to celebrate it in Israel now!"
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.5.2. Pro: [An ANC delegation](http://www.haaretz.com/twilight-zone-worse-than-apartheid-1.249503) of veterans of the struggle against Apartheid in South Africa described the situation in Palestine as "worse than anything we knew under Apartheid".
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.6. Con: Unlike Apartheid South Africa, the West Bank is nominally self-governed by Palestinians.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.4.7. Con: Israel's mistreatment of Palestinians in the West Bank is predicated on the need for self defence, rather than the domination of one racial group over another.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.5. Con: The compassionate reaction to human rights violations is to stop the human rights violations, not to adjust the legal status of the territory in which they occur.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.5.1. Con: Human rights workers can enter Palestine through a border with Jordan to the West Bank or through Israel to the West Bank and Gaza. In both cases, all visitors must pass through [Israel military checkpoints](https://www.welcometopalestine.com/getting-in/). Many are declared by Israel to be propagandists or spreaders of hate and [are denied entry](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/03/israel/palestine-rights-workers-denied-gaza-access). Changing the legal status of Palestine would guarantee human rights workers access to a Palestinian state unmolested.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3. Pro: The occupation allows Israel to stifle and control the economy of the West Bank.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: Thousands of Palestinian homes and shops in East Jerusalem are [destroyed](http://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2017/jerusalem-2016-home-demolitions/index.html) by the Israeli government, and only 2 percent of Palestinian permits for new construction are approved.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.2. Con: Israeli [trade](http://www.boi.org.il/he/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Documents/Israel-Palestinian%20trade.pdf) with Palestine is significant for the Palestinian economy. Palestinian purchases from Israel account for about two-thirds of total Palestinian imports and Palestinian sales to Israel account for about 81 percent of total Palestinian exports.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Since trade and investment are mutually beneficial, they would presumably continue in the absence of occupation.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.3. Pro: Israel has currently [established](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.772720) 14 economic zones in the West Bank that entrench its presence in the Palestinian territory.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Economic zones operate as a convenient way for Israel to get around the issue of legality of settlements: land is declared for industrial use, yet is often [populated](http://www.btselem.org/publications/summaries/201203_under_the_guise_of_legality) by settlements, and is not that important for the economy.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.4. Con: For many Palestinians, Israeli jobs are the [only](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-workers-idUSKCN0VV1J6) ones available to them. They provide much needed employment and considerably higher wages than Palestinian jobs.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Security officials in Israel have advocated for employing more Palestinians in Israel, as increased economic activity [reduces](http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-said-to-okay-work-permits-for-30000-more-palestinians/) the appeal of terrorism. As a result, the Israeli government is planning on [increasing](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.759885) the number of work permits given to Palestinians.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.4.1.1. Con: Yet these work permits are [distributed arbitrarily](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/07/permit-laws-west-bank-workers-israel-150729094809544.html), with young, unmarried Palestinian men rarely ever receiving one as they are deemed to be a 'security threat'. This prevents the Palestinian labour force from being fully employed.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.4.1.2. Pro: The number of Palestinians working in Israel [doubled](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-1.645266) between 2011-2015. This upward trend is likely to continue.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.4.2. Pro: Israeli businesses within settlements [provide tens of thousands of Palestinians with jobs](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-workers-idUSKCN0VV1J6) and a source of income.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.2.1.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.4.4. Con: These workers are [exposed](https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/01/19/occupation-inc/how-settlement-businesses-contribute-israels-violations-palestinian) to exploitative conditions, a lack of oversight on labour and environmental regulations, considerably less pay than their Israeli counterparts, and no additional benefits. One can hardly call them a gift to the Palestinian people.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.5. Pro: Israel [provides](https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/01/19/occupation-inc/how-settlement-businesses-contribute-israels-violations-palestinian) financial and regulatory incentives and permits to Israeli businesses for the construction and operation of settlement companies while severely restricting such permits and incentives for Palestinian businesses. This preferential treatment creates a dependency on Israeli businesses while preventing Palestinian businesses from growing.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.5.1. Pro: Since 1994, the military has [systematically refused](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/21/israel-quarry-shutdown-harms-palestinians) to issue permits for Palestinian quarries, even as it allocated large swaths of land in the West Bank for quarries in Israeli settlements. The World Bank estimates that this costs the Palestinian economy at least US$241 million per year.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.6. Pro: 42% of the land in the West Bank has been [requisitioned](http://www.btselem.org/download/201007_by_hook_and_by_crook_eng.pdf) \(p. 5\) by Israel. This reduces the land available for use to the Palestinians.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.6.1. Pro: Palestinians' land is [confiscated](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/02/palestinians-decry-west-bank-industrial-zone-expansion-170206090749576.html) without compensation in order to allow construction.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.7. Pro: Israel [prohibits](https://www.btselem.org/download/201105_dispossession_and_exploitation_eng.pdf) \(p. 31\) Palestinians from using over three-quarters of the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea area. On the remaining land, Israel limits Palestinian building and prevents any possibility of sustainable development of Palestinian communities.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.8. Pro: The World Bank [found](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2010/09/21/the-underpinnings-of-the-future-palestinian-state-sustainable-growth-and-institutions) that Israel preventing access to the majority of the land and water resources in the occupied territories to Palestinians was the cause of underdevelopment in Palestine.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.4. Con: Continued Israeli occupation of the West Bank prevents the authoritarian Islamist group Hamas from taking over the area.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.5. Pro: The Israeli [occupation imposes restrictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority_passport#Implications_of_the_passport) on Palestinians obtaining passports, preventing them from travelling freely. A lifting of the occupation would allow the Palestinian people to issue their own passports, allowing for easier travel around the world.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.6. Con: The security provided by Israeli forces in the West Bank allows for [foreign investment](http://www.aipac.org/-/media/publications/policy-and-politics/aipac-analyses/issue-memos/2009/10/aipac_memo_israeli_measures_in_west_bank_easing_palestinian_travel_boosting_economy.ashx) to pour into the area.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.6.1. Con: It is likely that even more foreign investment would have poured into the Palestinian territories if it were not for Israeli policies that stifle the Palestinian economy, as well as the repeated invasions of Gaza.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: The continued blockade [prevents economic development](http://www.btselem.org/gaza-strip/gaza-strip-siege-gaza-and-intensified-economic-sanctions) of Gaza, forcing economic dependence on Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Gazans are, on average, [worse off than in the 1990s](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20415675). Twenty-one percent are in deep poverty, living on less than 1,832 shekels \($534; £313\) a month, compared with 7.8% in the West Bank. The unemployment rate in the Strip is 40.8%, significantly higher than in the West Bank. Of particular concern is the high youth unemployment rate, which stands at more than 50% in Gaza.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.6.1.2.2. Pro: The Israeli blockade of Gaza [hampers](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=30948#.WPapC1KZORt) UN relief work. Important construction material required for rebuilding houses and roads is not allowed to enter Gaza.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.6.1.2.3. Con: Israel [continues](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-s-quot-blockade-quot-of-gaza) to supply electricity and water to the Palestinian people, and these plants are sometimes hit by rockets fired by Hamas from within the Gaza Strip, cutting power to thousands.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.6.1.2.3.1. Con: Yet Gaza's only power plant was [destroyed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/29/gaza-power-plant-destroyed-israeli-airstrike-100-palestinians-dead) in one of Israel's most intense air strikes in the occupied territory.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.6.1.3. Pro: Israel has repeatedly undertaken military operations to stem the tide of Palestinian terrorism. This can be seen in [Operation Defensive Shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Defensive_Shield) in 2002, the 2008/9 [invasion of Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_\(2008–09\)), and [Operation Pillar of Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Pillar_of_Defense) in 2012.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.7. Con: Israeli [security forces](http://www.aipac.org/-/media/publications/policy-and-politics/aipac-analyses/issue-memos/2009/10/aipac_memo_israeli_measures_in_west_bank_easing_palestinian_travel_boosting_economy.ashx) are training their Palestinian peers to be more effective in fighting terror in Palestine.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.8. Pro: Palestinian opportunities for education are limited because of the occupation.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.8.1. Pro: Israel's decision to withhold taxes from the Palestinian Authority causes a severe lack of funding for schools \([Roberston, p. 33](https://download.ei-ie.org/Docs/WebDepot/The%20Status%20of%20Higher%20Education%20Teaching%20Personnel%20in%20Israel,%20the%20West%20Bank%20and%20Gaza.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.8.2. Con: There are more universities now than [before](https://unitedwithisrael.org/the-facts-show-israeli-occupation-is-good-for-the-palestinians/) the West Bank occupation
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.8.2.1. Con: The UN and not Israel is providing the bulk of education in the West Bank and Gaza \([UNDP, p. 3](http://www.ps.undp.org/content/dam/papp/docs/Publications/UNDP-papp-research-PHDR2015Education.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.8.2.2. Con: The Palestine Technical-Tulkarem University College and the Al-Ummah Community College were established before 1967 \([Robinson, p. 32](https://download.ei-ie.org/Docs/WebDepot/The%20Status%20of%20Higher%20Education%20Teaching%20Personnel%20in%20Israel,%20the%20West%20Bank%20and%20Gaza.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.8.2.3. Pro: In the period of the British Mandate, the Peel Commission identified the lack of higher education opportunities for Palestinians as a major source of concern \([Robinson, p. 31](https://download.ei-ie.org/Docs/WebDepot/The%20Status%20of%20Higher%20Education%20Teaching%20Personnel%20in%20Israel,%20the%20West%20Bank%20and%20Gaza.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.8.2.4. Con: The number of universities in Palestine is not a good indicator of what Israel has done. These universities could have been created in spite of Israel, rather than because of Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.4. Con: Though a coordinated withdrawal is theoretically possible, it may be difficult to achieve. Israeli unwillingness to withdraw could mean that efforts to adequately coordinate withdrawal fails.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.2. Con: The Israeli/Egyptian blockade only applies to the Gaza Strip. The West Bank is able to trade with much fewer exceptions, thus trade negotiations are still important.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3. Pro: This could provoke Israel to act aggressively against Palestine in reaction, which could result in worsened conditions for Palestinians.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.1. Con: Israel has fought at least 3 wars in Palestine in the last decade and regularly conducts air and artillery strikes against Gaza. It is difficult to see how they could act more aggressively.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2. Con: If the United States were to recognize Palestine, it is unlikely that Israel would position itself against not only the majority of the international community but also its most important ally by becoming more aggressive towards Palestine.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1. Pro: Israel is far too [dependent](http://www.belfercenter.org/publication/israels-dependence-united-states-existential) on aid from the US to destroy relations.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Israel's trade is [highly dependent](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/isr/#Destinations) on the United States: 37% of its exports go to America, 14% of its imports come from there. No other country plays an equivalent role for Israel's trade.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: In fact, Israel exports [more](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/isr/show/all/2015/) to the United States than to its eleven next largest trade partners combined.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: No other country sends as many tourists to Israel as the United States. American tourists make up almost [one quarter](http://www.cbs.gov.il/publications17/yarhon0317/pdf/e7.pdf) of all tourism arrivals in Israel - and American tourists have in the past [shunned](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-tourism-to-france-perks-up/) countries they perceived to act in opposition to US interests.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: Because of the religious and cultural importance of Israel to both Christians and Jews, the two largest religious groups in the U.S., many Americans will have reasons to visit Israel independent of U.S. official policies.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.3. Pro: The US supports Israel diplomatically.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: The US has repeatedly voted against all other members of the UN Security Council, vetoing resolutions that would have criticized Israel. For example, resolutions on [settlement](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/F97C162F6A30647205256531005B4E15) [expansions](http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/un-documents/document/IP%20S2011%2024.php), [assassinations](http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/un-documents/document/IP%202004%20240.php), violating the [Geneva Convention](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/5ba47a5c6cef541b802563e000493b8c/b35c281bef2fa8f00525651b003675d3?OpenDocument) and [attacking UN supplies and killing UN workers](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/87CD207B928B40D885256C950067EF41).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.3.2. Pro: The United States has adopted a "[don't ask, don't tell](http://www.80bola.com.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/proliferation/israel/Israel%20crosses%20the%20threshold.pdf)" attitude towards Israel's nuclear program - a privilege which no other officially non-nuclear state enjoys.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.3.3. Con: American diplomatic support for Israel has [never been unequivocal](https://sethfrantzman.com/2016/12/24/abstaining-from-history-heres-all-the-un-resolutions-on-israel-the-us-abstained-on/). The US has supported, abstained from and vetoed UN resolutions criticizing Israel in the past.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.3.3.1. Con: Until December 2016, out of 226 UN Security Council resolutions related to Israel since 1948, the US has [abstained](https://sethfrantzman.com/2016/12/24/abstaining-from-history-heres-all-the-un-resolutions-on-israel-the-us-abstained-on/) from less than two dozen of them. It has only voted against Israel a handful of times.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.3.4. Pro: Even when the US was supposed to play a neutral role - for example during the negotiations of the Oslo Accords in 1993 and in Camp David in 2000 - it de-facto [sided with Israel](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n06/john-mearsheimer/the-israel-lobby).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.4. Con: [Israel's status as a nuclear power](http://www.rense.com/general26/historw.htm) allows the country to be independent of the whims of major powers like the United States.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.4.1. Con: Hamas and Hezbollah are the main threats faced by Israel, both of which are terrorist organisations. Nuclear weapons are effective deterrence against states, not non-state actors. Therefore, Israel's nuclear weapons do not grant it total independence.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.4.2. Con: Without tacit American acquiescence, the international community might call into question Israel's nuclear program and attempt to pressure the country into signing the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.3.2.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.4.2.2. Pro: There has been [international pressure](http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Israel-Under-Pressure-To-Give-Up-Chemical-Nuclear-Weapons-326452) on Israel to give up its nuclear weapons - without the support of the US, this international pressure may increase and force Israel to give up its nuclear weapons.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.4.2.3. Con: The outsized [power](http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/international-politics/impact-of-nuclear-weapons-on-international-relations/48526/) that any nuclear power has in international relations would likely continue to insulate Israel from any pressures to end their nuclear weapons program.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.5. Con: Israel has a [large conventional arms industry](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/defense-industry-the-business-of-war-in-israel-a-988245.html). As a result, Israel's security is not dependent on good relations with the US.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.5.1. Pro: Israel's defense industry is actually [undermined by US aid](http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/350424/israel-arms-industry-sees-big-hit-from-buy-american-provisions-in-38b-aid-d/) which forces it to "buy American". By restricting the amount that can be spent domestically, Israel's defence industry faces layoffs and closures.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.5.2. Con: Although Israel produces advanced battle tanks and drones, it is by no means self-sufficient in terms of equipping its armed forces. For airplanes, to name but one example, it is wholly dependent on procurement from the United States.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: All airplanes and nearly all helicopters of the [Israeli Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force#Aircraft) were bought from the US. With an eye on its international position, it is unlikely that Israel would be able to procure military technology on this level from elsewhere.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.5.2.1.1. Con: Dependence on US aid has [institutionalized](https://townhall.com/columnists/jeffjacoby/2016/09/05/israel-doesnt-need-american-foreign-aid-n2213875) Israeli reliance on air power and ever-more-advanced technology, at the expense of focusing more intensively on ground maneuvers and the unique threat posed by enemies waging asymmetric warfare. Israel would be better off without this aid.

1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.6. Pro: Israel receives almost 1% of its GDP in foreign aid from the United States, more than any other country and about 9% of America's foreign assistance budget \([State Department, p. 16, 20](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/224071.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.6.1. Con: Israel's dependency is shrinking. Whereas the size of its economy [has tripled](http://data.worldbank.org/country/israel) over the last two decades, the size of aid payments has stayed the same. The share of US aid among Israel's GDP thus sunk from about 3% to 1% \([CRS, p. 23](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33476.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.1.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.6.2. Pro: US aid accounts for [20% of Israel's defence budget and 40% of the IDF budget](http://www.belfercenter.org/publication/israels-dependence-united-states-existential). Israel is therefore heavily dependent on the US to maintain its defences.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.6.2.1. Con: Israel can hardly be said to be militarily dependent on the US. Even excluding America's military aid, it spends [one and a half times](https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex) as much on its military than all of its neighbors combined; the share of its GDP that it spends on the military is [the highest](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/Trends-world-military-expenditure-2016.pdf) among all the world's major armies.

1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.6.2.3. Pro: The US also provides [vital defense technologies](http://www.belfercenter.org/publication/israels-dependence-united-states-existential) that Israel would not have access to otherwise.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.6.3. Pro: U.S. military aid for Israel has been designed to maintain Israel’s “[qualitative military edge](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf)” \(QME\) \(pg. 1\) over neighbouring militaries. This is vital to its regional security.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.4.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.7. Con: It would be politically unviable for the US to completely cut off its aid to Israel, as [most US voters](http://www.gallup.com/poll/189626/americans-views-toward-israel-remain-firmly-positive.aspx) are staunchly pro-Israel \(or would at least oppose the US substantially cutting off aid\) so Israel still has plenty of room to become more intransigent and aggressive in reaction to this sort of move.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.7.1. Con: Israel could be made to feel its dependence on the United States even without a complete cut-off of relations. In 2004, the American government already [threatened to](http://www.meforum.org/926/at-what-cost-israel-china-ties) exclude Israel from the F-35 jet program - and thus Israel's primary way of updating its air force.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.7.2. Con: [46%](https://www.brookings.edu/research/american-attitudes-on-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/) of Americans support imposing sanctions on Israel in response to settlement-building.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.7.3. Pro: American citizens' views of Israel have remained steadily positive since [2001](http://www.gallup.com/poll/189626/americans-views-toward-israel-remain-firmly-positive.aspx), despite occasional Israel aggression against Palestine. While many might think some sanctions are acceptable, cutting off aid completely would likely be a step too far in the eyes of pro-Israel Americans.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.2. Con: Israel tends to [respond harshly](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/un-security-council-vote-resolution-settlements-west-bank-east-jerusalem-israel-netanyahu-a7493996.html) when the international community moves against it. It did so when the UN condemned Israeli settlements: Israel withdrew its ambassadors from countries that voted in favour of the resolution and refused to follow the resolution.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.3. Con: Israel is already largely isolated in international public opinion but - so far - did not see this as a reason to change its policies.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Israel has few other allies and is generally not seen favourably abroad. In the [BBC's popularity ranking](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22624104), it is on one of the last ranks, just ahead of North Korea.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.3.2. Pro: Surveys from countries like Britain show Israel's unpopularity. Among non-European countries, British people feel more unfavorable only towards North Korea; even Iran is perceived as more favorable than Israel \([Chatham House, p. 11](https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/field/field_document/20150129YouGovRaines.pdf?dm_i=1TY5,34ZC7,BHZIRQ,B8VH2,1)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.3. Con: Palestine does not pose a [military threat](https://imeu.org/article/comparison-of-millitary-strength-of-israel-and-the-palestinians) to Israel, so the need for aggressive action is minimal, if not non-existent.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.3.1. Con: While Palestine does not possess the military capacity to destroy Israel, the threat of terrorist attacks and mortar fire from groups such as Hamas still exists.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: [Every year](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/comprehensive-listing-of-terrorism-victims-in-israel) Israelis die from terror attacks committed by Palestinians or launched from Palestinian territory.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: As of May 2016, two thirds of Israeli citizens were afraid that they or someone close to them might be hurt by a terror attack \([IDI, p. 5](http://www.peaceindex.org/files/Peace_Index_Data_April_2016-Eng\(1\).pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.3.2. Con: Though Palestine may not currently pose a military threat to Israel, they still [consider](http://www.mintpressnews.com/palestinian-statehood-poses-threat-israel/200249/) Palestine to be an inherent threat to their own existence. Because Israel fears Palestine, they could feel it vital to strike against Palestine before they become strong enough to pose an actual military threat.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.4. Pro: Recognition would constitute a big step towards increasing Palestine's chances to become an independent state. Israel does not want this to happen and would want to prevent this while it's still possible.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.1.3.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.4.2. Pro: Part of the reason Netanyahu won [re-election](https://www.voanews.com/a/how-netanyahu-pulled-off-israeli-election-win/2685053.html) was because of his strong anti-Palestine rhetoric. A claim that US recognition of Palestine means that they become a larger threat, followed by harsher actions against Palestine, would gain him more support from his voter-base.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.4.2.1. Pro: The [rally-round-the-flag](http://www.jstor.org.proxy.mah.se/stable/3649343?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=anatomy&searchText=of&searchText=a&searchText=rally&searchText=effect:&searchText=George&searchText=W&searchText=Bush&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3Fwc%3Don%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bprq%3Danatomy%2Bof%2Bthe%2Brally%2Beffect%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3BQuery%3Danatomy%2Bof%2Ba%2Brally%2Beffect%253A%2BGeorge%2BW%2BBush%26amp%3Bso%3Drel%26amp%3Bhp%3D25&refreqid=search%3Af88037627ed90e32fb48fe293779dc21&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) effect is a sudden increase in approval ratings following periods of international crisis or war. The effect is mainly in reference to [US presidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect) but Netanyahu could benefit from the same effect among his more patriotic supporters, should he attack Palestine.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.4.2.2. Pro: Netanyahu is currently under an [investigation](http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-gifts-investigation-to-drag-on-until-autumn-report/) for corruption that could drag on for several more months. Acting aggressive in response to a US recognition of Palestine would serve as an effective distraction from this scandal.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.4.3. Pro: Recognition of Palestine has prompted retaliation from Israel in the past.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.4.3.1. Pro: Israel suspended a payment of [$127 million](https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/retaliation-against-palestines-welcome-accession-to-icc-must-stop/) due to the Palestinian authorities, as a response to Palestine's accession to the ICC a day after the statute was signed.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.4.3.2. Pro: In response to the UN's recognition of Palestine, Israel confiscated [£75 million](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/9717397/Israel-exacts-retaliation-for-Palestinian-statehood-vote-as-it-confiscates-75m-in-revenue.html) that it was supposed to pay Palestine and announced that it would build 3000 new settlers' home in areas that the Palestinians had earmarked as part of a future state.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.4.4. Pro: In order to prevent Palestine from being empowered by US recognition, Israel would likely increase the amount of harm that they already inflict upon Palestinians.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.4.4.1. Pro: Israeli settlements harm Palestinians.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.4.4.1.1. Pro: In the West Bank, water resources have been [seized](http://www.alhaq.org/publications/Water-For-One-People-Only.pdf) \(p. 16\) such that the Israeli settler population, numbering more than 500,000, consumes approximately six times the amount of water used by the Palestinian population of almost 2.6 million; this discrepancy is even greater when water used for agricultural purposes is taken into account.

They are paid as little as one-third the minimum wage they are entitled to receive, with the employers consistently violating safety regulations.

1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.6. Con: Even if the situation of Palestinians did not improve, this would be blamed on Israeli intransigence, and the US would no longer share a significant portion of the blame.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.2. Pro: Since recognition of Palestine would mean diplomatic relations with the US and potentially full membership in the UN, it is likely that less people would be motivated to join Hamas as they would feel less oppressed.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.2. Con: While the specific combination of psychological factors that cause an individual to become a terrorist may be unpredictable, scholars can identify [patterns](http://www.jstor.org.tkc.idm.oclc.org/stable/421717) among the types of causes which recruit terrorists \(and the [Palestinian conflict](http://hegghammer.com/_files/The_Palestine_Effect_The_Role_of_Palestinians_in_the_Transnational_Jihad_Movement.pdf) is one such cause\).

1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.4.1. Pro: The [US war in Iraq](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6137678) has significantly increased the threat of terrorism. This is independent of the Palestinian issue.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.4.2.

1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5. Con: It is unlikely that Palestinian organizations commit acts of terror in the US.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5.1. Pro: As of now, Hamas has not targeted US citizens \([Benjamin & Simon, p. 194](https://books.google.de/books?id=IOoBZvdNrIkC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=%22Thus%20far%2C%20Hamas%22&f=false)\), proving that their threats are little more than non-serious rhetoric.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5.2. Con: Just because Palestinian organisations do not commit terror acts in the US does not mean that the Palestinian cause does not inspire other terrorist groups.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5.3. Con: ISIS-linked groups have a presence both [in Gaza](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/hamas-fighters-defect-isis-islamic-state-nukhba-commando-iz-ad-din-al-qassam-gaza-palestinian-group-a7569786.html) and [the West Bank](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/3-ISIS-inspired-Arab-Israelis-plotted-tunnel-from-West-Bank-into-Israel-470036). This organisation has already [attempted](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/asia/isis-messaging-app-terror-plot.html) significant terror attacks on US soils.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5.4. Pro: There is little to no evidence that international terrorist organisations willing and capable of striking the US, like al-Quaeda, are linked to Palestinian groups \([Mearsheimer & Walt, p. 63](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=bQHXJ4JzxV4C&pg=PT3&lpg=PT3&dq=0-374-17772-4&source=bl&ots=APimckevjw&sig=iq9yYeg467Yc6VnXh-YNhuozdSA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjG7tjIobfUAhWCgbwKHeWAAcUQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&q=0-374-17772-4&f=false)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5.4.1. Con: [Ma’sadat al-Mujahideen](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-fires-haifa-jerusalem-terror-palestinian-militant-group-ma-sadat-al-mujahideen-mount-carmel-a7439271.html) is an al-Qaeda linked Palestinian Salafist group. It has claimed to be behind several fires in Israel, including the Mount Carmel forest fire that killed more than 40 people near Haifa in 2010 and the 2016 Haifa blaze that led to the evacuation of 60,000 people.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5.4.2. Con: [Army of Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Islam_\(Gaza_Strip\)) is a militant group that operates in the Gaza Strip. It draws inspiration from and is likely linked to al-Qaeda.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5.4.3. Con: Hamas has [loose ties](http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-hamas-al-qaeda-alliance/article/558605) with al-Qaeda: Hamas members receive training from al-Qaeda camps and often try to recruit fighters for their cause from al-Qaeda as well.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5.4.4. Con: Al-Qaeda has a [history](http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Al-Qaida-and-Palestinian-jihadists-The-Hamas-connection-339782) of conducting attacks in Israel by recruiting and sending in foreign fighters. After al-Qaeda started losing ground in Afghanistan, bin Laden marked Palestine as a top priority. Al-Qaeda does not need to be linked to Palestinian organisations in order to operate within Palestine.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5.4.4.1. Pro: The shoe bomber, Richard Reid, trained by Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, traveled to Israel in 2001 to [scout out](http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,203478-1,00.html) locations for potential bombings.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5.4.4.2. Con: There is little to no evidence connecting the central leadership of Al-Qaeda with attacks in Israel or on other Jewish targets. These attacks therefore do not adequately reflect the importance designated to Israel by Al-Qaeda \([Hegghammer/Wagemakers, p. 291](http://hegghammer.com/_files/The_Palestine_Effect_The_Role_of_Palestinians_in_the_Transnational_Jihad_Movement.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5.4.5. Pro: Al-Qaeda has [consistently](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-war-of-words-between-hamas-and-al-qaeda) condemned the Hamas leadership whenever they have run for elections or tried to work with Fatah in a unity government; Al-Qaeda's support for Hamas exists only when the latter adopts a military approach to the Palestinian conflict.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5.4.6. Pro: Hamas - Al-Qaeda interactions were negligible during the 1990's and 2000's \([T. Hegghammer and co., p. 285](http://hegghammer.com/_files/The_Palestine_Effect_The_Role_of_Palestinians_in_the_Transnational_Jihad_Movement.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5.4.7. Pro: Despite threatening to, Hamas has not joined Al-Qaeda's global jihad. Hamas sees itself as a [local resistance organization](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/could-hamas-target-the-west) and has limited its operations to targeting Israelis in Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.

1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2. Pro: Recognition will lead to an improved image of the US in the Arab world.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1. Con: Any improvement of America's reputation in the region will be limited as the Israel-Palestine question is only one of many issues that determine how America is seen.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1.1. Pro: Negative [stereotypes](http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/07/21/chapter-2-how-muslims-and-westerners-view-each-other/) about Westerners as 'selfish', 'violent' or 'greedy' help to perpetuate Anti-Americanism.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1.2. Con: Surveys have found that the Palestinian question is a significant determinant of attitudes towards America.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1.2.1. Pro: In the Arab World, the Palestinian question is a [significant](http://www.pewresearch.org/2005/11/10/arab-and-muslim-perceptions-of-the-united-states/) determinant of attitudes towards America.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1.3. Pro: The US supports corrupt autocracies in the region and thus [fuels](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-koppman/endless-us-support-for-di_b_6821136.html) anti-Americanism \([Lindberg & Nossel, p. 9](https://www.princeton.edu/~ppns/conferences/reports/fall/AA.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1.3.1. Pro: In non-democratic countries supported by and allied with the US, such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, the lack of representative government is seen as the primary obstacle to peace and stability in the region \([Zogby, p. 11](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/aai/pages/12021/attachments/original/1481751962/SBY2016_FINAL.pdf?1481751962)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1.4. Pro: The US has a track record of military interventions in the Middle East which have negatively shaped perceptions.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1.4.1. Pro: The presence of US soldiers alienates the local population.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: The [habits](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/saudi-arabia-withdrawl-us-forces) of US soldiers radicalize some locals as they drink alcohol and behave outside social norms, as was observed in Saudi Arabia.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1.4.1.2. Pro: US military bases and soldiers are a magnet for [terrorist attacks](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/saudi-arabia-withdrawl-us-forces), risking the lives of those nearby. In the 1990s, the base in Saudi Arabia was moved because of this.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1.4.2. Pro: A military presence is interpreted by some as an all out [war against Islam](https://theintercept.com/2016/10/11/us-military-operations-are-biggest-motivation-for-homegrown-terrorists-fbi-study-finds/). For individuals that link their identity to Islam, this can be seen as an attack on themselves.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1.4.3. Pro: The violence and death caused as a result of these military interventions leads to resentment towards the US.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.2.2.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1.4.3.2. Con: American interference in the region is generally not seen by public opinion as one of the most severe obstacles to peace and stability in the region - not even in countries directly affected by it like Iraq \([Zogby, p. 11](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/aai/pages/12021/attachments/original/1481751962/SBY2016_FINAL.pdf?1481751962)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1.5. Con: Surveys show that American culture and political values are generally seen as positive, whereas American policies in the Middle East evoke opposition - with the policies towards Palestine being among the prime sources \([Chiozza, p. 15](http://politics.as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/4737/chiozza_f04.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.2. Pro: A favourable image of the US allows for a better relationship between the US and Arab countries to form, which could lead to better trade agreements and intelligence sharing.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.2.1. Con: If there are pragmatic benefits to be gained through cooperation, Middle Eastern states will cooperate with the US regardless of "perception" of the US' morality as an actor.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.2.2. Pro: The US conducts operations in several countries in the Middle East, which they could do more easily if Arab countries had a more positive image of the US. Willingness to help and cooperate would likely be higher if the attitude towards the US were more positive.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.2.2.1. Pro: In their operations in Iraq, the US military [relied heavily](https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-01-31/iraqi-translators-who-served-us-military-are-desperate-exemption-trumps-travel) on assistance from local translators. The willingness of translators to cooperate, and of the local population to tolerate people who cooperate with the US military, was dependent on public perception of the US.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.2.3. Con: Given that most Middle Eastern nations, including Saudi Arabia and Egypt, [aren't democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index), it does not matter what the populace believes as much as what the government believes is in its regional security and economic interests.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.3. Pro: The Palestinian conflict colours public perception of the US in the Middle East.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.3.1. Pro: The people of major US allies such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt as well as of important regional players like Turkey see the occupation of Palestinian territories as the greatest threat to peace and stability in the region. America could gather sympathies by recognizing Palestine \([Zogby, p. 10](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/aai/pages/12021/attachments/original/1481751962/SBY2016_FINAL.pdf?1481751962)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.3.1.1. Con: Egypt's relations with Israel are the [best they have been in history](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/11/egypt-israel-relations-highest-level-history-161107083926863.html). They both cooperate on regional security concerns such as Hamas and terrorist groups in the Sinai peninsula, and Egypt's calls for peace between Israel and Palestinians are widely considered as empty rhetoric that is not accompanied by any diplomatic pressure on Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.3.1.2. Con: The same study states that the people in Iran, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq give scant attention to the Palestinian issue \([Zogby, p. 10](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/aai/pages/12021/attachments/original/1481751962/SBY2016_FINAL.pdf?1481751962)\)
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.1.2.1.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.3.3. Pro: A US government report found that attitudes by citizens of Egypt, Syria, Turkey, France, Morocco and Senegal are inspired by their concerns for Palestine \([Djerejian, p. 18](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/24882.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.3.4. Con: Given that most Middle Eastern nations, including Saudi Arabia and Egypt, [aren't democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index), it does not matter what the populace believes as much as what the government believes is in its regional security and economic interests.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.3.4.1. Pro: Israel [opened](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/samuel-ramani/why-israel-is-strengthening_b_11946660.html) its first diplomatic mission in the United Arab Emirates \(UAE\) three months after it stopped bombing Gaza in 2015. The Gulf states have signed covert deals with the Israeli defence contractors to gain access to the IDF’s prized military technology. This is used to secure oil wells. Economic interests trump the demand for a Palestinian state.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.3.4.2. Con: Even dictatorships are receptive to popular will to some extent. Complete disregard for popular opinion always leads to instability.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.3.4.3. Con: The fact that these countries have backdoor relations with Israel indicates that these relations are important for their regional security and economic interests. Being able to establish a more open relationship is in their interests; these countries will therefore care about whether public opinion permits an open relationship.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.3.4.3.1. Con: Pressuring Israel for a peace deal will likely alienate it as Israel does not want to recognise an independent Palestine. This risks destroying whatever gains have been made through backdoor and covert diplomacy.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.3.4.4. Con: While it might be that popular perception is not as important for state actors to the extent that they are non-democratic, it still influences many other aspects of national relations, since a nation is far more than simply its state.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.3.1.1.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.4. Con: Any benefit to US/Arab relations would be negligible at best and at worst it would be seen as a betrayal of one of their key regional allies, Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.4.1. Pro: US allies in the Middle East are more concerned about their own socio-economic conditions and security than about Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.4.2. Pro: Israel's enemies around the world \(including Hamas and the PA\) will not be pacified by recognition, or even the creation of a Palestinian state - only by the destruction of the Jewish one.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.4.2.1. Pro: Hamas and other vocal enemies of Israel could hardly sell more amicable relations to their domestic audiences and supporters after decades of hateful rhetoric towards Israel and threats of destruction.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.4.3. Con: America shouldn't be concerned about the reaction in Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.4.3.1. Pro: Israel does not behave as an ally to the United States.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: Israel has consistently spied on the United States. [See the Jonathan Pollard trial.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Pollard)
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.4.3.1.2. Pro: The Israeli Prime Minister [went to the US congress](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-spat-in-our-face-white-house-officials-say/) to undermine the President of the United States.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.4.3.1.3. Pro: Israel's [diplomatic efforts against the most important multilateral deal](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-israel/israels-netanyahu-draws-rebuke-from-obama-over-iran-speech-to-congress-idUSKBN0LZ0BS20150303) led by Obama were not consistent with an alliance.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.4.3.2. Pro: While one might expect one of America's closest allies to play a supportive role in times of conflict, Israel has been a strategic burden in the past, for example during the Gulf War in 1990 and 1991. The US government [intentionally had to keep](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ssfc0005/Israel%20and%20the%20Conflict.html) Israel out of the coalition against Iraq. Its participation might have led to more Arab support for Iraq and possibly even Arab countries leaving the coalition.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.4.3.2.1. Con: This singular instance from a quarter of a century ago is hardly representative of the United States' relationship with Israel as a whole.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.5. Pro: All Arab countries [recognise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_State_of_Palestine) Palestine as a state.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.6. Pro: Given the US's long history of [intense opposition](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/28/politics/ben-rhodes-veto-un-resolution-palestinian-state-obama/) to the recognition of Palestinian statehood, a decision this unprecedented and of this magnitude would have a massive impact on the attitudes of Arab nations towards the US.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.6.1. Con: US recognition would be unlikely to actually alleviate the plight of the Palestinian people, so anger at the US for perpetuating the conflict up to the present day would persist.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.7. Pro: As recognition of Palestine would be perceived as a step in opposition to Israel's stated interests, this is likely to be perceived positively throughout the Middle East.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.7.1. Pro: Practically no one in major Middle Eastern countries has a positive opinion of Israel, sees the country as a contributor to peace and stability in the region, or perceives relations with Israel as important \([Zogby, p. 5, 7, 8](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/aai/pages/12021/attachments/original/1481751962/SBY2016_FINAL.pdf?1481751962)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.7.1.1. Con: There exists a '[moderate axis](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20140723-israeli-general-the-moderate-axis-is-helping-us-fight-hamas/)' of [Middle Eastern nations](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/11/egypt-israel-relations-highest-level-history-161107083926863.html), including Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and several of the Gulf states, as well as Jordan, that have offered Israel a wide margin of flexibility to pursue the war on Hamas. Public calls for peace are accompanied by backdoor diplomacy.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.7.1.1.1. Pro: These nations [perceive](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/world/middleeast/fighting-political-islam-arab-states-find-themselves-allied-with-israel.html?_r=0) Hamas to be an Islamist threat that could destabilise their own countries. Iran's support and funding of Hamas has effectively made these nations prioritise the destruction of the group over the recognition of a Palestinian state.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.2.7.1.1.2. Pro: The Gulf states [fear](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/samuel-ramani/why-israel-is-strengthening_b_11946660.html) Hamas' link with the Muslim Brotherhood, which they believe is backed by Iran.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3. Con: This will alienate Israel and damage US-Israeli relations.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.1. Con: Even though the current Israeli government is not negotiating, the Israeli public [supports](http://www.inss.org.il/uploadImages/systemFiles/No.%20916%20-%20Israeli%20on%20National%20Security%20Index.pdf) the establishment of a Palestinian state - [even if](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/678) safeguards need to be established \(e.g. a multinational security force\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.1.1. Con: At the same time, only about [a third of Israelis](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/678) support the idea of splitting control over Jerusalem. This indicates that, although most Israelis are committed to a two-state solution in principle, in practice they are unwilling to make the concessions necessary to achieve such a solution.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.1.2. Con: While the Israeli public may not oppose the creation of a Palestinian state, the political establishment does, and the political establishment decides what Israel's official stance on the creation of a Palestinian state is.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: Right wing Israeli politicians, after the election of Donald Trump, have [declared](http://www.jpost.com/US-Elections/Donald-Trump/Likud-MKs-react-to-Trumps-victory-in-US-Presidential-Election-472088) the era of a Palestinian state as over.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Naftali Bennett, leader of the Jewish Home party - a lynchpin of Israel’s nationalist right and current coalition partner and Education Minister - stated that there will [never](http://www.timesofisrael.com/bennett-no-palestinian-state-even-if-world-penalizes-israel/) be a Palestinian state, even if the world penalises Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.1.3.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.1.2.3. Con: If the public supports a two-state solution, then if the political establishment maintains its opposition to the idea, it will likely be voted out in future elections.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.1.2.3.1. Con: Only [16%](http://www.timesofisrael.com/for-43-of-likely-voters-economic-issues-not-the-palestinians-or-iran-are-top-priority/) of Israeli voters ranked deterioration of relations with Palestinians as their most important issue in the 2013 elections. The two-state solution will likely not be the deciding factor in any election.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.1.3. Pro: Surveys emphasize that the support for a two-state solution would probably be at more than 70% in case of a referendum, as about a quarter of the population usually states that they are undecided or unsure \([INSS, p. 2](http://www.inss.org.il/uploadImages/systemFiles/No.%20916%20-%20Israeli%20on%20National%20Security%20Index.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.2. Con: Surveys indicate that the American public would be in support of less amicable and supportive relations with Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.2.1. Pro: [More than half](http://www.washingtonreport.me/2017-may/grant-smith-american-public-opinion-about-u.s.-aid-to-israel-and-other-top-aipac-programs.html) of Americans believe that their government should abandon the principle of not openly criticizing Israel and its policies, as some demand.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.2.2. Pro: [Six out of ten](http://www.washingtonreport.me/2017-may/grant-smith-american-public-opinion-about-u.s.-aid-to-israel-and-other-top-aipac-programs.html) Americans believe that the United States gives too much or even far too much foreign aid to Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.2.3. Con: However, less amicable and supportive relations are not the same thing as unilaterally recognising Palestine at the expense of American-Israeli relations.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.2.4. Pro: [The vast majority](http://www.washingtonreport.me/2017-may/grant-smith-american-public-opinion-about-u.s.-aid-to-israel-and-other-top-aipac-programs.html) of Americans oppose the system by which campaign contributions are paid to members of Congress based on their stance towards Israel. This indicates that Americans are unhappy with the extent to which Congress is assumed by default to support Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.2.4.1. Con: This indicates unhappiness towards politicians supporting Israel by default, not against supporting Israel for rational reasons. The former is a corruption of democracy, while the latter is a politician doing their job.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4. Pro: This will likely alienate Israel further from any negotiations towards a two-state solution.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.2.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.2. Pro: The right wing establishment in Israel is thoroughly [opposed](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy-defense/137396-170211-minister-says-israel-faces-historic-opportunity-to-nix-two-state-solution) to the creation of a Palestinian state. Unilateral action by the US will likely push it further away.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.3. Pro: The Israeli government has [emphasized in the past](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2016/11/7/israel-rejects-french-peace-initiative-again), and the Israeli public has stated in surveys \([PSR, p. 7](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)\), that the preferred method of engaging with the Palestinians is through bilateral talks. Thus, the involvement of and pressure from third actors will likely be received negatively.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.3.1. Con: Recognition does not constitute involvement in the talks. Thus, it is fully compatible with bilateral talks between Israel and Palestine.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.4. Con: US recognition of Palestine might get Israel back to the negotiation table by signaling disapproval of current Israeli policies on the peace process. This can encourage the Israeli public to question its government's stance, as that is leading to increasing international isolation.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.4.1. Pro: More than half of all Israelis believe that there are high or very high chances that the international community will impose sanctions on their country for its policies in the occupied territories. This indicates that the Israeli public is aware that it is running out of international sympathy \([IDI, p. 5](http://www.peaceindex.org/files/Peace_Index_Data_January_2016-Eng.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.4.1.1. Pro: This aligns with public opinion in the US: almost half of all Americans support the so far unprecedented step of imposing sanctions in reaction to new settlements \([Brookings, p. 21](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cmep_20161202_public_opinion_poll.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.4.2. Con: The majority of Israelis believe that their country should not take the international community's criticism towards its policy in the occupied territories seriously into account. The country will thus probably not be responsive to a change in the American position on these issues \([IDI, p. 4](http://www.peaceindex.org/files/Peace_Index_Data_January_2016-Eng.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.4.3. Con: More than eight out of ten Israelis believe that the international community's criticism towards Israel's policies in the occupied territories is biased in favor of Palestinian interests. It is thus unlikely that criticism will be well-received \([IDI, p. 4](http://www.peaceindex.org/files/Peace_Index_Data_January_2016-Eng.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.3.1.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5. Con: The United States would not lose much by alienating Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.1. Con: Israel is one of the [most prolific](https://www.sipri.org/research/armament-and-disarmament/arms-transfers-and-military-spending/arms-production) exporters of arms. In the past, the US was able to influence the targets of these exports, for example by blocking sales [to China](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/27/AR2005062700351.html). This leverage might be lost if relations with Israel deteriorate.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.2. Pro: The extent and unconditionality of American support for Israel has been described as going against America's strategic and moral interests, and as being primarily the result of strong lobbying \([Mearsheimer/Walt, p. 335f.](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=2iUdyQs_NhYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Israel+Lobby+and+American+Foreign+Policy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiP6LCW2c_TAhUMbrwKHfvZBH0Q6AEIJTAA)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.2.1. Pro: In terms of the funding it provides to members of Congress, the Pro-Israel lobby ranks [among the top 25](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/mems.php), far above any other country-specific lobby group in the US.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.2.2. Pro: As of 2015, and according to a survey among Washington insiders, the influence of the Pro-Israel lobby on American politics was [amongst the top five](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/18/AR2005051802143.html), along with national organizations such as the NRA and the American Association of Retired Persons \(AARP\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.2.4.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.3. Con: If the United States were to distance itself from Israel, this could be interpreted as the abandonment of a close ally - and especially so in other countries allied with and dependent on US support, like South Korea and Taiwan. America's system of alliances could therefore suffer.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.3.1. Con: America retains the ability to simultaneously denounce Israel for its actions yet reaffirm its commitment to its relations with other countries.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.3.1.1. Con: When the United States recognized China in the 1970s, this was perceived as a de-facto abandonment of Taiwan. Even though the US reaffirmed its commitment to other allies, several of them were shocked and opted for less reliance on America in their security affairs \([Overholt, p. 710f.](http://www.theoverholtgroup.com/media/Articles-China/PresidentNixons-Trip-to-China-and-Its-Consequences-Asian-Survey-jstor.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.3.1.2. Con: The US has [affirmed](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/212617-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-israel) its support for Israel [many times](https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-speech-to-aipac-donald-trump-affirms-support-for-israel-1458605471) in the past. A move like this would indicate that affirmations of support on the part of the US are worth little, and do not necessarily indicate underlying US policy.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.3.2. Pro: [Recent events](http://www.npr.org/2016/07/23/487151465/casting-doubt-on-u-s-commitment-to-mutual-defense-donald-trump-unsettles-nato-al) have cast doubt on the US's loyalty and commitment to longstanding alliances. This move would reinforce and deepen an existing distrust of the US's reliability.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.3.3. Pro: President Obama [spoke of](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91150432) an "unshakeable commitment to Israel's security". Recognizing Palestine could be interpreted as a weakening of this commitment to American allies.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.3.3.1. Con: The US can recognise Palestine without compromising its commitment to Israel's security - defence pledges and aid deals will still remain.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.4. Pro: Israel is not even among the [top-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_the_United_States) of America's trade partners measured in trade volume.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.5. Pro: Israel is not even among the [top-20](http://travel.trade.gov/view/m-2016-I-001/index.asp) origins of tourists visiting the United States. Countries of comparable size, like Sweden and Switzerland, outrank it.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.6. Pro: Israel has [no US military bases](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/us-military-bases-around-the-world-119321), whereas regional players with poor historic relations with Israel \(like Jordan and Turkey\) do have US bases. A deterioration in the Israeli-US relationship would not affect US capacity to project power regionally.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.7. Pro: A less close relationship with Israel might be appreciated by the American public: 37% believe that Israel has too much influence on US politics, although the plurality believes it has the right amount of influence \([Brookings, p. 4](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2015-Poll-Key-Findings-Final-1.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.7.1. Con: In a Republican-dominated era, the opinions of Republican voters are most influential. The majority of them believe that Israel has the right amount of influence \([Brookings, p. 4](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2015-Poll-Key-Findings-Final-1.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.8. Pro: This could result in less aid provided to Israel, freeing up funds that could be spent elsewhere.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.8.1. Pro: The US has spent almost $100 billion on Foreign Military Financing \(FMF\) since 1985 [\(CRS p.22\)](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33476.pdf).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.8.1.1. Con: FMF payments are meant to enable foreign governments to purchase American military products and services. The money therefore comes back home and supports the US economy.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.8.1.1.1. Con: Israel is allowed to convert about a quarter of this military aid into shekels to spend at home \([CRS, p. 2](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.8.1.1.1.1. Con: The provision that allows Israel to spend 26% of military aid domestically is being [phased out](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/15/big-us-military-aid-package-to-israel-has-strings-attached.html) over the next five years, requiring Israel to spend all military aid within the US.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.6. Pro: Israel could sell sensitive military technology that either the US shares with it or it creates itself in retaliation for US recognition.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.6.1. Pro: It was upon Washington's insistence that Israel agreed to terminate the sale of problematic weapons and military technology to China and deprive itself of both a major market for its world-class military exports and a source of influence with Beijing. Without this pressure, Israel would resume selling weapons to China \([Blackwill, p. 9](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/Blackwill-Slocombe_Report.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.6.2. Con: Due to Israel's reliance on American support for equipping its military, it is unlikely that Israel would endanger this support by going against its supplier's interests.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.6.2.3.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.1.5.2.1.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.6.3. Pro: Israel has a track record of selling US arms to third countries without authorization. This was the case in the 1980s when it sold cluster bombs to Ethiopia and in 1999 when it sold drone technology to [China](http://forward.com/news/2501/china-crisis-straining-us-israel-ties/) \([Clarke, p. 95](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1149008?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.6.4. Pro: The US shares sensitive military technology with Israel , such as F-35 aircraft \([Sharp, p. 12](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.6.4.1. Con: Presumably, the US would stop sharing sensitive technology with Israel if the latter started selling it as a form of retaliation for the recognition of Palestine.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.6.5. Con: Selling sensitive military technology would hurt Israel as much as the US, as Israel shares many of the same enemies. This would make intentional leaking of technology unlikely.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.6.5.1. Con: While US relations with Russia are at their [lowest point](http://nationalpost.com/news/world/putin-says-u-s-russia-relations-at-lowest-point-since-cold-war-asks-american-business-leaders-to-help-trump/wcm/06d1cab2-109e-4677-88e3-ed3b7a21fc8d) since the Cold War, Israeli relations with Russia are the [warmest](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Despite-Syria-Israel-Russia-relations-are-the-warmest-in-history-485062) they have ever been, despite conflicting goals in Syria.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.6.5.2. Con: While relations between the US and China are growing [worse](http://www.realclearworld.com/articles/2017/04/06/6_reasons_us-china_relations_are_headed_for_trouble_112279.html) over conflicting priorities of trade and security, Israel and China have [vowed](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2080572/china-and-israel-vow-deepen-relations) to deepen relations.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7. Pro: A deterioration in Israel-US relations will jeopardize America's operations and presence in the region.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.1. Con: Countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Kuwait or the UAE find it difficult to [side with the US](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116433750279531793) publicly on Iran unless "Washington pressures Israel on a peace initiative". If anything, recognition increases regional cooperation with the US.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.1.1. Con: The US already [shares intelligence](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-yemen-exclusive-idUSKBN0N129W20150411) and [sells weapons](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-defense-congress-idUSKCN11R2LU) to Saudi Arabia, independent of the situation in Palestine. Regional cooperation and a Palestinian peace deal are not linked.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.1.2. Con: The US is [seeking](http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-looks-to-form-arab-alliance-against-iran-report/) to form an anti-Iran coalition with Arab states that would share intelligence with Israel as well. A peace deal is not required for Arab nations to cooperate with the US when their interests align.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.1.3. Con: Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE have a strong anti-Iran position [due to sectarian tensions](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/saudia-arabia-iran-and-the-new-middle-eastern-cold-war-a-1090725.html). The US does not need to pressure them for support.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.2. Pro: Israel hosts a large-scale American [war reserve stock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_reserve_stock#War_Reserves_Stock_Allies-Israel) with some $1.8 billion worth of equipment for use in case of armed conflict in the region.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.3. Pro: Israel is a world leader in the development of unmanned aerial systems, for both intelligence collection and combat, and it has shared with the U.S. military the technology, the doctrine, and its experience regarding these systems \([Blackwill, p. 10](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/Blackwill-Slocombe_Report.pdf)\). America's ability to gather intelligence could be restricted if Israel decided to cut of trade in military technology.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.3.1. Pro: The US [relies](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/u-s-israel-intelligence-collaboration) on Israel for crucial intelligence about Hamas, Hezbollah, and al-Qaeda and its affiliate groups \([Blackwill, p. 11](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/Blackwill-Slocombe_Report.pdf)\) in the region. Deterioration of relations could put this intelligence cooperation at risk.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.3.1.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.3.1.2. Con: Intelligence about Hamas and Hezbollah is of relevance for the US only insofar as it helps to protect Israel. Neither organization targets America.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.4. Pro: Israel is [strongly opposed](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/israels-master-plan-crush-irans-nuclear-program-13392) to the Iran nuclear deal. If Israeli-US relations deteriorate as a result of US recognition of Palestine, Israel may launch a pre-emptive strike against Iran, raising the possibility of a regional war.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.4.1. Pro: The threat of Iran acquiring a 'break-out' weapon after ten years, when the Iran Nuclear deal expires, may lead Israel to [strike](http://www.ocregister.com/2015/07/26/why-israel-will-hit-iran-after-obamas-gone/) Iran, especially if it feels it is losing US support and must protect itself.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.4.2. Con: Amos Yadlin, the former head of IDF Intelligence, [claimed](http://www.timesofisrael.com/ex-idf-intel-chief-strike-on-iran-likely-wont-spark-regional-war/) that it was highly unlikely that a missile strike by Israel would lead to a regional war, primarily because Iran was aware of Israel's ability to destroy it in an all out war. This in turn would threaten the survival of the Iranian regime.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.4.3. Con: The Israeli military and intelligence community supports the Iran nuclear deal.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.4.3.1. Con: The Israeli political and security establishments are [split](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/netanyahu-idf-are-split-the-iran-nuclear-deal-15368?page=2) on their attitude towards the Iran deal. Despite the security establishment's acceptance of the Iran nuclear deal, Netanyahu could still order an attack on Iran.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.4.3.2. Pro: Official Israeli statements on Iran is nothing but political rhetoric. Multiple Israeli security officials, including Israeli Chief of the General Staff Lieutenant General Gadi Eizenkot, have [stated](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/iran-nuclear-deal-israel/472767/) that Iran's nuclear threat has been pushed back by at least 10-15 years, if not eliminated.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.4.3.3. Pro: The Israeli security establishment has [warned](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/01/israel-netanyahu-trump-security-iran-deal-nuke-agreement.html) Netanyahu to not touch the Iran nuclear deal. They assessed that destroying the nuclear deal will unite the Iranian people behind the regime, and possibly even push it to pursue an all out nuclear option.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.4.4. Pro: Israel [was close to](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Peres-bombshell-I-stopped-an-Israeli-strike-on-Iran-469112) preemptively striking Iran in the past. A falling out with the United States might embolden Israel to do so next time - and thereby torpedoing America's politics in the region, for example the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.6.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.8. Con: Damaging its relationship with the US would isolate Israel in the international community. This isolation could set in motion a [diplomatic avalanche](http://www.timesofisrael.com/left-alone-at-un-israel-can-ignore-but-not-avoid-diplomatic-fallout/) that will ultimately weaken Israel’s position in negotiations with the Palestinians. Israel would not like this to happen.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.4.1.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9. Con: This might be a positive outcome; its close association with Israel is a burden for the United States.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.1. Con: The [majority of Americans](https://www.brookings.edu/research/american-attitudes-on-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/) do not perceive Israel as a burden to the United States.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.1.1. Con: The public is not always aware of the intricacies of international politics, and is thus unlikely to be aware of the cost to their country of such a close association with Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.1.2. Pro: Even if the actual benefits are hard to quantify, three out of four Americans believe that Israel provides "essential military and intelligence cooperation" for the United States in the region \([Brookings, p. 38](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cmep_20161202_public_opinion_poll.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.1.2.1. Con: This is not proof of Israel actually providing essential military and intelligence cooperation. Geo-strategic security policies are not made on \(often\) misplaced public belief.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.5.2.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.7.2.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4. Pro: The negative perception of Israel's defiance of international law, occupation of Palestinian territories and military engagements with surrounding countries, reflects poorly on the US as the "[principal enabler](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/americas-misadventures-in-the-middle-east/)" of this behavior.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.1. Pro: In Germany, about as many people have a negative as have a positive opinion about Israel. The [most common attributes](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/226525/umfrage/umfrage-zum-bild-der-deutschen-von-israel/) associated with Israel by the majority of Germans are ruthlessness and aggressiveness \([Bertelsmann, p. 31](https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/BSt/Publikationen/GrauePublikationen/Studie_LW_Germany_and_Israel_today_2015.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.2.3.2.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.3. Pro: In a BBC poll on the international perception of various countries, Israel was among the most negatively viewed ones, ahead of only North Korea, Pakistan and Iran \([BBC, p. 4](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/country-rating-poll.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.4. Con: National interests often override potential public relations damage. Else the US would not have routinely supported [regimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_authoritarian_regimes_supported_by_the_United_States) that are far worse and unpopular than Israel, from Pinochet in Chile to Marcos in the Phillipines and King Abdullah in Saudi Arabia.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.5. Pro: Recognizing Palestine, and thus taking a more moderate stance on the conflict, would serve to dissociate the US from Israel's actions.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.6. Con: The negative views cited here aren't simply because of Israel's defiance of international law, but relate to Israel's perception on the whole. Because of continued widespread anti-Semitism, and because of the link between anti-Semitism and negative perceptions of Israel, the U.S should not use these negative perceptions to guide their own actions.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.6.1. Pro: Anti-semitism is still widespread in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_Europe#Public_opinion_polls).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.6.2. Pro: Empirical [studies](https://www.uni-marburg.de/fb03/politikwissenschaft/methoden/team/heyder/criticism_of_israel_vs_anti_semitism_2005_english.pdf) that seek to separate and analyze views about Jews and views about Israel find that negative attitudes towards Israel often function as "communicational detours"  to get around norms against expressing anti-Semitic views.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.6.2.1. Pro: It is crucial to note that this does not imply that all criticism or negative perceptions about Israel stem from anti-Semitism, but merely that widespread anti-Semitism contributes to negative views about Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.6.3. Pro: To the extent that these negative perceptions are formed by underlying anti-Semitic prejudices, it would be immoral to buckle under pressure resulting from these prejudices.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.6.4. Pro: To the extent that these negative perceptions are formed by underlying prejudices rather than Israel's actions towards Palestine, and given that the United States will still be close to Israel on many issues despite recognising Palestine, it is unlikely that simply recognizing Palestine as a state will change any reputational damage that the U.S. suffers from its association with Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.6.4.1. Con: This will be perceived not just as a dissociation from Israel's actions towards Palestine, but also as a general repudiation of Israel as an actor. So even if negative perceptions of Israel are based on anti-Semitism, the US's image will improve.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.7. Con: Given the US' long history of unwavering support for Israel, one largely symbolic move by a single administration wouldn't substantially affect perception of the US.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.8. Con: These negative perceptions of Israel do not exist in a vacuum and should at least be taken with a grain of salt, as they might be based on biased reporting in the media.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.8.1. Pro: Researchers [argue](https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/politik/article130459269/Ein-Grossteil-deutscher-Medien-berichtet-voreingenommen.html) [that](http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-08/israel-medien-kritik) the German mainstream media tends to be far more critical and harder on Israel than on Palestine, especially when locating the fault for violence, and to even rely on antisemitic cliches in its reporting.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.8.2. Pro: A former reporter for the Associate Press in Jerusalem [argued that](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/11/how-the-media-makes-the-israel-story/383262/) the international media tends to assign blame for the region's conflict primarily to Israel, is being co-opted by its enemies and thereby became "an amplifier for the propaganda" of radical Palestinian forces.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.8.3. Pro: A study analyzing the reporting by Al-Arabiya \(Saudi Arabia\) and Al-Jazeera \(Qatar\) found that Palestinians are usually cast as victims and Israelis as aggressors. Palestinian perspectives and suffering are emphasized over the Israeli experience \([Elmasry et al., p. 750](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1748048513482545?journalCode=gazb)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.8.3.1. Con: This bias is hardly surprising and not representative as both media outlets are sponsored by governments that do not even accept Israeli passports on their territory.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.8.4. Pro: A 2003 report by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy found that various American television stations and newspapers report in a biased and ignorant fashion on the Israel-Palestine conflict, casting Israel as the sole aggressor and buying into the propaganda and lies of Palestinian radicals \([Muravchik, p. 113f.](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/CoveringtheIntifada.pdf.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.8.4.1. Con: The Washington Institute for Near East Policy [was founded](http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/04/09/robert-satloff-doth-protest-too-much/) by the former President and Vice-President of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee \(AIPAC\), the country's largest pro-Israel lobbying group. Its publications should therefore be seen as agenda-driven.

1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4. Pro: Progress in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians would weaken America's adversaries in the region.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.1. Pro: Hezbollah [was founded](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-10814698) as an Islamic resistance movement against Israel and the United States. Hamas, equally, [was founded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas#Aims) as a resistance movement against Israel. Less hostile relations between Israel and Palestine would undermine the raison d'être of both organizations.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.1.1. Con: Hezbollah does little to threaten Israel or project Iranian power anymore. Its participation in the Syrian civil war has gotten it stuck [in a quagmire](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/opeds/Levitt20140911-PRISM.pdf); Israel [considers](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20170223-hezbollah-and-hamas-are-too-weak-to-fight-says-israel-army-chief/) neither Hezbollah nor Hamas capable of putting up a fight at this time.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.1.1.1. Con: The war-fighting experience Hezbollah has gained in the Syrian Civil War, as well as the huge number of weapons it has captured or been provided with, has actually put it in a [much stronger position](https://www.wsj.com/articles/syrias-civil-war-produces-a-clear-winner-hezbollah-1491173790) to fight Israel in the future.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.1.2. Con: There is no amount of "less hostile relations" that would sate the Hamas. They [do not want a two-state solution](http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/2017/01/hamas-state-solution-charter-170127121227513.html), they want an Israel-free solution.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.2. Pro: Better relations between Israel and the Palestinians would weaken Iran, one of the principal adversaries of the United States, which has long used Hezbollah and Hamas [as proxies.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_proxy_conflict)
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.2.1. Pro: Support for terrorist groups [allows](https://www.lawfareblog.com/irans-support-terrorist-groups) Iran to undermine and intimidate rivals, influence the Israel-Palestine conflict, disrupt peace negotiations, and project power in regional crises. Weakening Iran's proxies, such as Hezbollah, would weaken the ability of Iran to carry out these disruptive actions.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.1.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.2.2. Pro: According to Prime Minister Netanyahu, defense analysts in Israel [estimate that](http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-80-of-security-threats-against-israel-emanate-from-iran/) more than 80% of the country's security problems emanate from Iran.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.2.3. Con: Recent efforts at cooperation, for example through the 2015 nuclear deal and the rise of common enemies like the Islamic State, call into question whether relations between the US and Iran are still as hostile as they were in the past.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.2.3.1. Con: Iran is one of the very few countries without a US embassy. This is only the case in extraordinary circumstances \(e.g. in Taiwan\) or because of very bad relations \(e.g. with North Korea and Iran\).
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.2.4. Con: Iran's [raison d'être](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/8007/iran-palestinian-state) for funding militant groups in Palestine such as Islamic Jihad is to kill Jews and destroy Israel. A peace deal will not stop Iran from continuing to fund militant groups.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.2.4.1. Con: However, a peace deal will reduce public support for militant groups as there will no longer be a reason to advocate for militancy. This will weaken the position of Iranian funded militant groups.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.2.4.1.1. Pro: Hamas's ability to militarily resist Israel is dependent on its ability to [operate amongst civilians](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/gaza-hamas-fighters-military-bases-guerrilla-war-civilians-israel-idf) in the Gaza Strip.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.1.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.3. Con: This is dependent on Israel playing along and tensions with Palestine decreasing, which is far from assured.

1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.4. Con: Recognition of Palestine will make it more difficult for Israel to stop militant activities, such as those of [Hezbollah](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Hezbollah-cells-in-West-Bank-busted-by-Israeli-security-forces-464233), in the West Bank.

1.1.1.3.1.4.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.9.4.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.7. Pro: Recognizing Palestine would improve America's standing among the people of Palestine.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.7.1. Con: Palestine has barely 4.5 million citizens and [an economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)) the size of Burkina Faso's. It is hardly relevant for the United States as a partner or market.
1.1.1.3.1.4.6.7.2. Con: The Palestinians know their side of the conflict is legitimate. Unless the US de-recognises Israel at the same time as recognising Palestine, it won't gain any particular credit from the Palestinians for recognising what is perceived by Palestinians as reality.
1.1.1.3.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.
1.1.1.3.1.6. Pro: Various international and Israeli courts have found the occupation of Palestinian territories by Israel to be illegal.
1.1.1.3.1.6.1. Pro: The International Court of Justice found that Israel effectively '[annexed](http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law/9780199588893.001.0001/law-9780199588893-chapter-8)' East Jerusalem with the 1980 Jerusalem Law.
1.1.1.3.1.6.1.1. Con: In 1980, a [legal opinion](http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law/9780199588893.001.0001/law-9780199588893-chapter-8) argued that the extension of Israeli law over East Jerusalem did not equate to annexation. Israel had not annexed East Jerusalem, but merely extended its norms and laws over the eastern half of the city.
1.1.1.3.1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.6.2.
1.1.1.3.1.6.3. Con: The US is a sovereign state and must put its own geostrategic interests first; it need not regard itself as bound by national or international courts.
1.1.1.3.1.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.
1.1.1.3.1.6.3.2. Con: That the US need not recognize the legitimacy of other national or international courts does not mean that it should not. Indeed, the treaties and conventions that have established International Law are in principle [binding](https://www.hg.org/international-law.html) on the US.
1.1.1.3.1.6.3.3. Pro: There is no worthwhile standard called "international law" to be bound by; what passes for international law is fait accomplis, post-hoc storytelling and victor's justice.
1.1.1.3.1.6.4. Pro: In a 1988 judgement, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that Israel had annexed East Jerusalem. \([HCJ 282/88, p. 4](http://www.hamoked.org/files/2010/1430_eng.pdf)\)
1.1.1.3.1.6.5. Pro: Numerous [UN Security Council](http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law/9780199588893.001.0001/law-9780199588893-chapter-8) and General Assembly resolutions regard the Israeli presence in East Jerusalem as 'invalid'.
1.1.1.3.1.6.5.1. Pro: The 1980 [Jerusalem Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Law), which proclaimed the whole city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, was condemned as a "[violation of international law](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/DDE590C6FF232007852560DF0065FDDB)" by the UN Security Council.
1.1.1.3.1.7. Pro: The UDHR has been used as the basis of many legally binding international agreements, all of which Israel has signed and ratified. This means that Israel should be held accountable for the articles which they have broken.
1.1.1.3.1.7.1. Pro: The UDHR definitions of fundamental freedoms and human rights is used in the [United Nations Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights#Significance_and_legal_effect), which is binding on all member states.
1.1.1.3.1.7.2. Pro: The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights \([ICESCR\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights) is a multilateral treaty adopted by the UN's General Assembly in 1966. It commits its parties to work toward the granting of economic, social, and cultural rights. Israel limits Palestinian's access to this.
1.1.1.3.1.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.
1.1.1.3.1.7.3. Pro: The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \([ICCPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights)\) is a multilateral treaty adopted by the UN's General Assembly. It commits its parties to respect the civil and political rights of individuals. Israel is denying Palestinians these rights by preventing Palestinian independence.
1.1.1.3.1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.3.
1.1.1.3.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.
1.1.1.3.1.9. Pro: International law means nothing and American support for international law means even less if the U.S.A. will openly support illegal policies for political gain.
1.1.1.3.1.10. Con: America has already taken a stance [against](https://www.timesofisrael.com/despite-relentless-obama-criticism-settlements-grew-as-much-in-his-years-as-in-bushs/) settlements in the West Bank, therefore does not need to recognise Palestine as a state.
1.1.1.3.1.10.1. Con: Yet, as the article explains, the US has been unable to stop Israel from expanding settlements. In fact, the rate of construction of such settlements has increased, so America does need to do more.
1.1.1.3.1.10.2. Con: Trump has given [mixed signals](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/10/trump-apparent-u-turn-israeli-settlement-growth) about the construction of settlements in the West Bank - recognising Palestine as a state will be a firm indicator that America does not tolerate further expansion of settlements on Palestinian territory.
1.1.1.3.1.11. Con: The 1967 war was one of [self-defense](http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/why-israeli-settlements-are-not-a-violation-of-international-law/) and not conquest because Israel was only claiming territory from Jordan's unjust annexation. If Israel would have given away the territory to Jordan, it would have been allowing Jordan to continue to hold territory that was originally gained illegally in an aggressive war.
1.1.1.3.1.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1.3.
1.1.1.3.1.11.2. Con: Jordan's unjust annexation, in turn, was of a nominally independent Palestinian state with clear borders. Israel has no more claim to it than Jordan does.
1.1.1.3.1.12. Con: Regarding territorial occupation, there’s a key legal difference between ‘de facto’ \(in fact\) and ‘de jure’ \(in law\). In its de jure form, a return to sovereign, pre-conflict borders is mandated. However, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire left a gap in the chain of sovereign custody, stifling application of the law. As de facto occupying power, Israel still bears responsibility to those under its authority, but the appropriate disposition of lands is undecided and must therefore be negotiated.
1.1.1.3.1.13. Con: Israel's occupation of the West Bank is grounded in legitimate security concerns.
1.1.1.3.1.13.1. Con: Even if self-defense allows for certain breaches of international law, these measures need to be in line with [Art 49-53](https://www.ilsa.org/jessup/jessup17/Batch%201/Articles%20of%20Responsibility%20of%20States%20for%20Internationally%20Wrongful%20Acts.pdf) of state responsibility as agreed upon by the International Law Commission and the UN General Assembly.
1.1.1.3.1.13.1.1. Pro: Israeli actions are not in conformity with the material preconditions based in Art 50 and 51, such as respect for fundamental human rights or proportionality of actions.
1.1.1.3.1.13.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.2.6.4.

1.1.1.3.1.13.1.2. Pro: Israeli actions violates the procedural conditions of necessity and termination of violations as spelled out in Art 52 and 53.
1.1.1.3.1.13.1.2.1. Pro: Countermeasures need to end once attacks on Israel have stopped. Yet the occupation has continued even when attacks stopped.
1.1.1.3.1.13.1.2.2. Pro: Fatah pledged to stop attacks on Israel in [2002](http://www.gainesville.com/article/LK/20020911/news/604177106/GS/). Thus Palestine complied with the demands of Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.13.2. Pro: Palestinian militants are a threat to Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.13.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.3.1.1.
1.1.1.3.1.13.2.2. Pro: When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, it was taken over by Hamas, which then used the territory to launch [numerous missile attacks](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32053999) on Israeli civilian targets. The same would happen in the case that Israel ends its presence in Palestinian territory.
1.1.1.3.1.13.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.
1.1.1.3.1.13.2.2.2. Con: Israel already easily defends itself from these missile attacks from Gaza using the [Iron Dome missile defense system](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.604039). The success of this system makes obsolete the need for continued occupation.
1.1.1.3.1.13.2.2.2.1. Con: Iron Dome is still not a perfect defense. In the 2014 Gaza War, [Israeli civilians were still killed](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/unlawful-and-deadly-palestinian-rocket-attacks-gaza) by rocket fire from Gaza.
1.1.1.3.1.13.2.2.2.2. Pro: Iron Dome can intercept [approximately 90%](http://aviationweek.com/defense/iron-dome-blunts-90-enemy-rockets) of all projectiles fired from Gaza.
1.1.1.3.1.13.2.2.2.3. Con: Each interceptor missile [costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome#Cost) $20,000-$50,000 USD. Continually utilizing missile defense would drain the Israeli security budget.
1.1.1.3.1.13.2.2.3. Pro: When Israel does not militarily control the West Bank it has to take [military actions](https://www.idfblog.com/facts-figures/rocket-attacks-toward-israel/) to curb missile attacks, as was done successfully in Gaza in 2008 and 2012. This results in excessive civilian casualties and destruction of infrastructure.
1.1.1.3.1.13.2.3. Con: The number of Israelis killed by Palestinian militants is so [small](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/total-casualties-arab-israeli-conflict) - less than 100 Israelis per year - that it could not be considered a legitimate security concern.
1.1.1.3.1.13.3. Pro: Palestinians have been consistently responsible for the failure of peace processes, forcing Israel to maintain an occupying force in order to protect itself.
1.1.1.3.1.13.3.1. Pro: Abbas rejected a peace proposal made by Olmert in [2008](http://www.timesofisrael.com/abbas-admits-he-rejected-2008-peace-offer-from-olmert/).
1.1.1.3.1.13.3.1.1. Con: Olmert's offer lacked [transparency](http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Details-of-Olmerts-peace-offer-to-Palestinians-exposed-314261) as he was unwilling to provide a map of the envisioned partition of Jerusalem. Therefore, the offer was difficult to accept.
1.1.1.3.1.13.3.1.2. Con: [Olmert himself blames](http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Details-of-Olmerts-peace-offer-to-Palestinians-exposed-314261) the failure of the peace process on Israeli ministers Tzipi Livni and Ehud Barak.
1.1.1.3.1.13.3.2. Con: If the occupation had protective reasons there would be no Israeli civilians settling there. Also those same civilians contradict what you say - they say they live there because the land has been promised to them by God.
1.1.1.3.1.13.3.3. Con: The Oslo Accords were a land-for-peace deal. Israeli settlement expansions and creation of a security barrier in 2002 that encroached on Palestinian land were clear indications of Israel's [non-compliance](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/oslo-israel-reneged-colonial-palestine) with the peace agreement.
1.1.1.3.1.13.3.4. Con: The failure of the Camp David negotiations in 2000 were the result of Israel's unacceptable demands.
1.1.1.3.1.13.3.4.1. Pro: In an interview, Barak admitted that a "[razor-thin](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2002/06/13/camp-david-and-after-an-exchange-1-an-interview-wi/)" strip of territory between Jerusalem and the Jordan River would have been transferred to Israeli control. This would have cut the West Bank apart and therefore was not acceptable to the Palestinians.
1.1.1.3.1.13.3.4.2. Pro: Israel demanded a demilitarized state \([Pressman, p. 16](http://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/pressman.pdf)\). This would have abrogated Palestine's right to self-determination.
1.1.1.3.1.13.3.4.3. Pro: Barak's offer was not sufficient as it only envisioned a gradual control over only 92% of the West Bank \([Pressman, p. 16](http://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/pressman.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.13.3.4.4. Con: In [2000](http://bostonreview.net/jeremy-pressman-lost-opportunities-israel-palestine), at Camp David, Arafat declined Barak's offer for a Palestinian state.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4. Con: The occupation and settlements endanger Israelis rather than protecting them.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1. Pro: US recognition of Palestine will improve Israel's security.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.1. Pro: Progress in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians would weaken Israel's adversaries in the region.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.4.1.

1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.1.4. Con: If Israel believed that getting along better with the Palestinians would pay dividends in terms of weakening their other adversaries, they'd be pushing for it themselves.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2. Con: US recognition may lead to Israel also recognising a Palestinian state and having to withdraw from the occupied territories. This would heavily endanger Israelis' security.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2. Pro: Recognizing Palestine will jeopardize the security of Jewish settlers in Palestine because protection by Israel becomes more difficult.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.1. Pro: Jewish settlers in Palestinian territory [regularly come under attack](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/world/middleeast/west-bank-kiryat-arba.html?_r=0) by Palestinian extremists.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.2. Con: The Jewish settlers have no right to settle on Palestinian territory in the first place.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Settlers nevertheless have many children who would be endangered by Israeli withdrawal, and those children are not morally culpable for the actions of their parents.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.10.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.3. Con: Israel [removed](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/18/world/middleeast/tearfully-but-forcefully-israel-removes-gaza-settlers.html?_r=0) Israeli settlers from Gaza when it withdrew in 2005. It can simply do the same now.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.3.1. Con: Removal of Israeli settlers from Gaza led to violent clashes between the settlers and the IDF. Given the [emotive reaction and backlash](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.667736) the government faced after forcefully removing 9,000 settlers, no government would risk forcefully removing 400,000.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.6.1.4.1.1.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.3.3. Con: The sheer number of settlements, as well as the distribution throughout almost the [entirety of the West Bank](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/12/22/map-the-spread-of-israeli-settlements-in-the-west-bank/?utm_term=.4c135f3b8781), would make this an incredibly difficult task.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.3.3.1. Con: Independent proposals based on the situation in 2011 estimate that swaps involving merely 5% of Palestinian territory and no dislocation of Palestinians could bring about 80% of settlers onto Israeli territory \([Washington Institute, p. 12](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/StrategicReport06.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: In order to reduce the amount of territory annexed by Israel, other options would exchange a mere 3.7% of Palestinian territory and still be able to bring almost 70% of settlers onto Israeli territory \([Washington Institute, p. 14](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/StrategicReport06.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.3.3.1.2. Con: There has been considerable expansion of settlements since 2011, and more [constructions of settlements](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/24/israel-announces-2500-more-west-bank-settlement-homes) promised by the current government. This renders plans based on the situation in 2011 irrelevant.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.3.3.2. Con: [Almost 80%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/12/22/map-the-spread-of-israeli-settlements-in-the-west-bank/?utm_term=.e3d69a333cee) of settlers live within the Israeli [West Bank barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier), which could be used as a line to mark areas for land swaps.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.3.3.2.1. Con: The Israeli West Bank Barrier is [illegal](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-israel-barrier-idUSL0714340920080707) under international law, built on Palestinian territory, and an arbitrarily defined border. There is no reason why this barrier should be used as the border to decide land swaps.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.3.3.2.2. Con: It is unlikely that Palestinians would be willing to accept this barrier - which they oftentimes refer to as an "[apartheid wall](https://web.archive.org/web/20080307023217/http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ukfs/hi/newsid_6040000/newsid_6044000/6044090.stm)" - as a permanent border.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.3.3.3. Pro: [400,000 Jewish settlers](http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-israel-gaza-disengagement-insight-idUSKCN0QF1QQ20150810) - 50 times as many as were withdrawn from Gaza - live among 2.3 million Palestinians. This will be exponentially more difficult, if at all possible, than the removal of [9,000](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.667736) settlers from Gaza.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.4. Con: This issue is only of minor relevance for the Jewish opposition to a two-state solution. Surveys indicate that [only 20%](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/678) of Israeli opponents would change their opinion if settlers' security was guaranteed.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.4.1. Con: That is still a significant portion of the population. Such a rise in support of a two-state solution has the potential of changing the calculus of domestic Israeli politicians.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.5. Pro: Jewish settlements in the West Bank are [protected by the Israeli Defense Forces](http://www.haaretz.com/idf-soldiers-problem-in-west-bank-isn-t-palestinains-it-s-jews-1.401683) \(IDF\). US recognition will make their operations more politically controversial and could contribute to a partial withdrawal of this defense.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6. Pro: A recognition of Palestine as a state will lead to increased demands by Palestinians that Israeli settlers be expelled from their state. This will likely lead to increased violence.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1. Con: The problem could be mitigated by land swaps through which Israel keeps territory with major settlements.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.3.3.1.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1.2. Con: Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority has [stated](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/StrategicReport06.pdf) \(p. 2\) that land swaps must be based on land of equal size and value, yet Israel still hasn't committed to this principle. This alone dooms the possibility of agreeing on land swaps.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1.3. Con: Even if land swaps were fair and would put an end to all settlements, a solid majority of Palestinians oppose the idea \([PSR, p. 3](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1.4. Pro: In the 2000 Camp David peace talks, both sides [agreed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Camp_David_Summit#Territory) to a solution whereby in the two-state solution, pre-1967 borders would be adjusted so that the largest settlements would be under Israel's control in exchange for the provision of more land to the Palestinian state elsewhere. Withdrawal from the other, much smaller settlements would then be easy.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1.4.1. Con: There has been considerable expansion of settlements since 2000, and more [construction of settlements](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/24/israel-announces-2500-more-west-bank-settlement-homes) promised by the current government. What was feasible 17 years ago is not necessarily feasible today.

1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1.5. Pro: [About half](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/678) of all Israelis support in principle the idea of land swaps to retain Israeli control over territory with major settlements.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.3.3.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1.7. Con: Hamas has declared its [opposition](http://jfjfp.com/?p=42804) to land swaps.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1.8. Con: Land swaps are simply a negotiating tactic used by Israelis to [legitimise](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/03/israel-false-narrative-land-swaps-170312095110936.html) the ongoing expansion of settlements.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1.9. Con: Land swaps will mean some Palestinians will either end up living in Israel, where they are likely to face [discrimination](https://www.adalah.org/uploads/oldfiles/upfiles/2011/Adalah_The_Inequality_Report_March_2011.pdf), or they will be forced to relocate, which is unfair towards them.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1.9.1. Con: A number of [independent plans](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/StrategicReport06.pdf) for land swaps have been proposed under which no Palestinian villages would be annexed and no Palestinians displaced.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1.9.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.3.3.1.2.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1.10. Pro: The Arab League has [endorsed](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10027869/Israel-welcomes-Arab-Leagues-land-swap-position.html) the idea of mutually agreed upon land swaps.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1.11. Con: The only land swap map put forward by Israel so far [prejudiced](http://www.aljazeera.com/palestinepapers/2011/01/2011122114239940577.html) Palestinian contiguity, water aquifers and the viability of Palestine. Mutually agreeable land swaps are likely to be impossible.

1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.4. Con: Israel's withdrawal from the Palestinian territories would help to reduce tensions in the region and thus contribute to Israel's security.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.3. Pro: Solving the Palestinian question is cited as a [precondition](http://world.time.com/2014/02/04/iranian-foreign-minister-lays-out-condition-for-iranian-recognition-of-israel/) by Iran for recognizing Israel. Should America's recognition of Palestine lead to this, one of Israel's biggest foes would thus possibly take a more conciliatory stance.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.4. Con: If the US recognises Palestine as a state, it must pressure both Egypt and Israel to lift the blockade of Gaza. This will allow Hamas to obtain even more weapons and resources with which to attack Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.4.1. Con: A recognition of statehood does not mean that the US needs to stop worrying about security concerns. The US interferes militarily for security reasons in many countries that it recognises as legitimate. If Hamas posed a legitimate security threat, the US could get involved in some capacity regardless of Palestinian sovereignty.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.4.2. Con: Hamas attacks Israel in order to achieve an independent, sovereign Palestine state. If this is achieved, attacks from Hamas will likely no longer be a concern.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.2.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.4.2.2. Pro: Hamas would want to reduce its attacks in response to US recognition, in order to incentivize the US to make more favourable gestures towards Palestinians in the future.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.4.2.3. Con: Hamas would likely continue attacks against Israel, indeed [its covenant](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp) calls for the "obliteration" of Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.4.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.3.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.4.3. Con: The US doesn't have to lift a finger to help Palestine post-recognition if it doesn't want to. Nothing in US or international law would create such an obligation.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.6. Pro: Recognizing Palestine as a state might help Palestine to make progress in establishing its own security apparatus that can help to curtail terrorism and other attacks against Israel.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.1.1.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.7. Pro: Recognizing Palestine will take away from the factors that motivate terrorism against Israel.

1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.7.2. Con: Even if Israel follows suit in recognizing Palestine, Israel would likely maintain control over the Temple Mount/Al-Aqsa, [a major motivation](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/temple-mount-tensions-al-aqsa-mosque-rumors-behind-palestinian-unrest-n440811) for past terrorist attacks.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.7.2.1. Pro: Despite being located in East Jerusalem, Israel will almost certainly attempt to retain control over [key holy sites in the Old City](https://expertvagabond.com/religious-sites-jerusalem/), including the Wailing Wall \(the holiest site in Judaism\), located directly below the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.7.2.2. Pro: Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has said that the Western Wall and Temple Mount [will remain Israeli forever](http://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-may-24-2017/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter).
1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.7.3. Pro: Coercing a foreign military force to withdraw from the terrorist groups homeland has been a strong motivator of most suicide terrorism campaigns between1980 and 2003. Recognising Palestine might be perceived as a step in this direction \([Pape, p. 42f.](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SOlnH3f_dXwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=islamic+terrorism+motivations&ots=hmNcjUh9tt&sig=sR3OQtSfYFPPOCU7uVqJSjEOPc8#v=onepage&q=motivation&f=false)\).

1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.7.6. Pro: Palestinian terrorism against Israel has been linked to the loss of identity and dignity through relentless foreign domination and the absence of any political progress in creating a nation. Recognizing Palestine might help to overcome these feelings and signify political progress \([Khosrokhavar, p. 110ff.](https://books.google.co.kr/books?redir_esc=y&id=yGswAAAAYAAJ&dq=Suicide+Bombers%3A+Allah%E2%80%99s+New+Martyrs)\).

Ending what many perceive as an occupation of Palestinians might help to change these attitudes \([PSR, p. 17](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/poll%2062%20English%20full%20text.pdf)\).

1.1.1.5. Pro: A recognized Palestinian state encompassing both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip would likely descend into severe infighting, and would become an unstable, if not failed, state. The status quo is better than this outcome.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: The Palestinian economy has seen a trajectory of ["strong growth"](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/137111468329419171/West-Bank-and-Gaza-Area-C-and-the-future-of-the-Palestinian-economy) in the past despite massive challenges. This demonstrates an economic dynamism that would make it unlikely to collapse into a failed state.
1.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Economic growth alone is by no means a predictor of whether a state can descend into domestic turmoil. All major states of the Arab Spring - [Tunisia](https://tradingeconomics.com/tunisia/gdp-growth-annual), [Egypt](https://tradingeconomics.com/egypt/gdp-growth-annual), [Libya](https://tradingeconomics.com/libya/gdp-growth-annual), [Yemen](https://tradingeconomics.com/yemen/gdp-growth-annual), [Syria](https://tradingeconomics.com/syria/gdp-growth-annual) and [Bahrain](https://tradingeconomics.com/bahrain/gdp-growth-annual) - experienced steady and moderate economic growth of around 4% prior to the events of 2011.
1.1.1.5.1.2. Con: In a [more recent report](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2017/02/13/pr1746-IMF-Staff-Concludes-Visit-to-West-Bank-and-Gaza), the IMF speaks of "increasingly difficult conditions" for the Palestinian economy and states that the "outlook for the economy is daunting". This is hardly an optimistic evaluation of Palestine's prospects.
1.1.1.5.2. Pro: The Palestinian Authority is already undemocratic and dictatorial.
1.1.1.5.2.1. Con: Palestinians would still be better off living under an independent undemocratic government than an undemocratic state that is subservient to Israel. Many of the difficulties in the lives of Palestinians are imposed by Israel, difficulties they would no longer have to face if Israel no longer controlled most of the West Bank.
1.1.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.
1.1.1.5.2.2. Pro: The Palestinian Authority is increasingly moving towards establishing a [police state](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20160524-a-palestinian-police-state-in-waiting/).
1.1.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Amnesty International has [reported](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/03/evidence-shows-palestinian-security-forces-violently-suppressed-peaceful-protest-in-ramallah/) on how Palestinian security forces violently and brutally suppress peaceful protests. [Excessive force](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde21/006/2013/en/) by security forces in quashing any activism has been used for many years.
1.1.1.5.2.2.2. Pro: Palestinian security forces [regularly](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/patrick-strickland/accusations-torture-pa-detains-hundreds-hamas-activists) arrest, kidnap and beat student activists.
1.1.1.5.2.2.3. Pro: The PA’s Preventive Security and General Intelligence security agencies [arbitrarily and repeatedly detain journalists](https://www.hrw.org/report/2011/04/06/no-news-good-news/abuses-against-journalists-palestinian-security-forces), prevent them from seeing lawyers or family members while in detention, confiscate or damage their equipment, and in some cases torture them. This is aimed at censoring free speech and minimising reporting on their own abuses.
1.1.1.5.2.2.4. Pro: The Palestinian Authority Security Forces \(PASF\) are beset by continuing violent patronage-based behaviour \([Marten](https://barnard.edu/sites/default/files/isa_paper_2013_pasf_militias_and_diffusion.pdf), p 3\). This will likely lead to [infighting and divisions](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/opinion/global/the-bane-of-palestinian-infighting.html) in the security forces if an independent Palestinian state is created.
1.1.1.5.2.3. Pro: [Corruption and patronage politics](https://al-shabaka.org/briefs/corruption-in-palestine/) is widespread and endemic in the Palestinian Authority.
1.1.1.5.2.3.1. Pro: If employees express criticism of PA policies, they are likely to be forced into early retirement, [denied salary payments](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/02/palestinian-fatah-elections-gaza-salaries-abbas-dahlan.html), or arbitrarily removed from their posts. They may also face a series of [punitive measures](https://al-shabaka.org/briefs/corruption-in-palestine/), including denial of promotion or transfer to distant areas.
1.1.1.5.2.3.2. Pro: According to the first Palestinian audit conducted in 1997, nearly 40% of the Palestinian Authority budget - approximately US$ 326 million - had been [misappropriated](http://www.u4.no/publications/overview-of-corruption-and-anti-corruption-in-palestine/). A 2011 report by [Transparency Palestine](https://www.aman-palestine.org/en/reports-and-studies/1387.html) indicates the continuation of this same trend, with the waste of public funds remaining the most prominent visible form of corruption.
1.1.1.5.2.3.3. Pro: Between 2009 and 2013, the Palestinian Authority has managed to "[lose](http://www.israeltoday.co.il/NewsItem/tabid/178/nid/24181/Default.aspx)" nearly $3 billion in financial aid from Europe.
1.1.1.5.2.3.4. Pro: A 2016 [poll](http://www.thetower.org/3414-new-survey-96-of-palestinians-believe-palestinian-authority-is-corrupt/) of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip found that 95.5 percent believe that there is corruption in the Palestinian Authority government.
1.1.1.5.2.4. Pro: President Mahmoud Abbas is serving his 10th year of what was supposed to be a 4 year term, and has [not called elections](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/6/mahmoud-abbas-no-champion-of-democracy-for-palesti/). He is instead ruling by Presidential decree.
1.1.1.5.2.4.1. Pro: He has [not openly cultivated a successor](http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/trend-lines/15857/abbas-stumhttps://mosaicmagazine.com/picks/2017/02/mahmoud-abbass-appointment-of-a-new-deputy-chairman-wont-prevent-a-violent-succession-struggle/bles-at-home-despite-palestine-recognition-gains-abroad) as he has focused on keeping his grip on power. A violent succession struggle is likely and will only lead to worse governance.
1.1.1.5.2.5. Con: The Palestinian Authority is forced to be undemocratic in order to ensure some semblance of stability. This will likely change after recognition.
1.1.1.5.2.5.1. Pro: Israel has [halted transfers of the tax revenue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/03/israel-tax-payments-withhold-palestine-international-criminal-court) it collects on behalf of the Palestinians in retaliation for their move to join the International Criminal Court in the Hague. This has exacerbated economic woes that Fatah cannot abate.
1.1.1.5.2.5.2. Con: The Palestinian Authority [engages in brutal suppression](https://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=760017) of Palestinians in order to maintain its power. This does not contribute to stability.
1.1.1.5.3. Pro: Withdrawing from the occupied areas will create a political and military vacuum that will open the doors for militant groups to take control of the state.
1.1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Naftali Bennett, leader of the Jewish Home Party and an important partner in the Israeli ruling coalition, has argued that this is exactly what will happen. He cites [historical precedent](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/opinion/naftali-bennett-for-israel-two-state-is-no-solution.html) - the 2000 withdrawal from Lebanon that led to the strengthening of Hezbollah and the 2005 withdrawal from Gaza that led to the rise of Hamas - as proof.
1.1.1.5.3.1.1. Con: The cases cited by Bennett might equally be interpreted as the respective Israeli occupations causing the surge in support for radical parties, not the subsequent withdrawal.
1.1.1.5.3.2. Con: The current conditions of the Palestinian territories are what provides radical groups a foothold. By providing Palestinians with the right to live in their own state, they will have little need to turn to radical Islamists.
1.1.1.5.3.3. Pro: ISIS is already gaining [influence and popularity](http://www.atimes.com/article/hamas-powerless-isis-gains-ground-palestine/) with Palestinians at the expense of Hamas.
1.1.1.5.3.3.1. Pro: Although ISIS is a relatively new presence in Palestine, [7% of Palestinians](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/636) and 13% in the Gaza Strip perceive ISIS as representing true Islam. This can enable ISIS to gain a foothold in Palestine.
1.1.1.5.4. Con: Hamas is taking measures to become a [more moderate and open political group](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/hamas-accepts-palestinian-state-1967-borders-170501114309725.html) - this indicates that Hamas could work together with Fatah and the Palestinian Authority.
1.1.1.5.4.1. Con: In the past, Hamas has [violently clashed with Fatah](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/05/2011549435141647.html) to establish control over key areas. Clearly, the group has little intention to share power.
1.1.1.5.5. Pro: Hamas and Fatah, the two dominant groups in control of Gaza and the West Bank respectively, will never be able to work with each other.
1.1.1.5.5.1. Con: The aspiration for Palestinian statehood lies at the center of Hamas' interests. Progress in this direction is therefore likely to lead to a more conciliatory attitude on the side of Hamas.
1.1.1.5.5.1.1. Pro: Hamas recently changed its core doctrine, and now [accepts a Palestinian state with 1967 borders](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/hamas-accepts-palestinian-state-1967-borders-170501114309725.html).
1.1.1.5.5.1.1.1. Con: Yet the [announcement](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/hamas-accepts-palestinian-state-1967-borders-170501114309725.html) does not recognise Israel, does not give up the goal of liberating all of Palestine, and falls short of actually accepting the two state solution.
1.1.1.5.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [new Hamas announcement](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/hamas-accepts-palestinian-state-1967-borders-170501114309725.html) stated that "We shall not waive an inch of the Palestinian home soil". This suggests that while on paper Hamas is willing to accept a two-state solution, in reality, it supports something entirely different.
1.1.1.5.5.1.1.2. Con: Hamas recently appointed [Yahya Sinwar](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/world/middleeast/yehya-sinwar-hamas-gaza.html), a militant hard-liner well known as an unstinting enemy of Israel, as its leader in Gaza. The new announcement by Hamas is not indicative of any moderation in its policies.
1.1.1.5.5.1.1.3. Con: The new document is aimed more at [de-linking](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-05-01/hamas-to-soften-stance-on-israel-muslim-brotherhood-in-policy-document-sources) Hamas from the Muslim Brotherhood in an attempt to improve ties with Egypt and other Arab states, rather than a genuine acceptance of Israel.
1.1.1.5.5.1.1.4. Con: This [moderation](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/world/middleeast/hamas-fatah-palestinians-document.html?_r=0) is an attempt to challenge Fatah over the leadership of the Palestinian people, rather than an acceptance of the two state solution.
1.1.1.5.5.1.2. Con: It doesn't follow that giving Hamas what they want would make them more conciliatory. It's equally likely they would claim their intransigence so far has paid dividends, and ask for even more.
1.1.1.5.5.1.3. Pro: Hamas has in the past been willing to enter negotiations and uphold agreements, for example the [2008 ceasefire agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_ceasefire) with Israel \(which broke down after six months due to violations and disagreements on both sides\).
1.1.1.5.5.2. Con: The example of Northern Ireland, where in [2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election,_2007) Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party managed to form a government, suggests that former terrorist organisations can be integrated into government more easily after peace has been established.
1.1.1.5.5.2.1. Con: Sinn Féin and the DUP have been deadlocked in negotiations over the formation of a power sharing government [since March 2017](http://www.thejournal.ie/dup-sinn-fein-impasse-3478690-Jul2017/). This suggests that the ability of factions to find common ground does not necessarily last.
1.1.1.5.5.3. Pro: Hamas and Fatah have [fundamentally different approaches](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/04/a-brief-history-of-the-fraught-relationship-between-fatah-and-hamas/361178/) to the state of Israel. Hamas believes the state does not have the right to exist, and Fatah believes it does, choosing to attempt political solutions instead.
1.1.1.5.5.3.1. Pro: Fatah has an official stance of [nonviolent resistance](http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=423962), while Hamas consistently uses terrorist tactics against Israel.
1.1.1.5.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.5.4.
1.1.1.5.5.4. Pro: Multiple past attempts to work together have resulted in failure.
1.1.1.5.5.4.1. Con: While past behavior indicates what Hamas and Fatah are likely to do, it doesn't follow that the two groups can't find a way to work together in the future.
1.1.1.5.5.4.2. Pro: In 2014, Fatah and Hamas were able to form a [unity government](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/6/19/palestinian-political-crisis-deepens-with-collapse-of-unity-government.html) for the first time, but it collapsed in less than a year.
1.1.1.5.5.4.3. Pro: In 2011, both sides agreed to an [Egypt-brokered peace deal](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13215062). But the rival sides [couldn't agree](https://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/06/12/152939.html) on who to name the interim prime minister of the unity government, and the plan fizzled out.
1.1.1.5.5.4.4. Pro: A 2012 [reconciliation deal](https://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/02/07/193239.html) was not [followed through on](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/world/middleeast/palestinians-deliver-letter-on-peace-talks-to-netanyahu.html).
1.1.1.5.5.5. Con: Both Hamas and Fatah realise that they need to work together, and have agreed to form a new [National Council](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/fatah-and-hamas-agree-to-form-unity-palestinian-government-to-end-election-gridlock-moscow-russia-a7533696.html) in order to hold elections.
1.1.1.5.5.6. Pro: While President Mahmoud Abbas has declared security cooperation with Israel as [sacred](http://www.timesofisrael.com/abbas-vows-to-uphold-sacred-security-coordination-with-israel/), Hamas has [vowed](http://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-vows-to-stop-west-bank-security-cooperation-with-israel/) to end that cooperation.
1.1.1.5.6. Pro: Hamas is a violent, radical organisation who would never accept a power-sharing agreement.
1.1.1.5.6.1. Con: Many radical organizations have accepted power-sharing agreements in the past. Hamas could do the same.
1.1.1.5.6.1.1. Pro: Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland shares power as one of the region's main political forces despite being the [former political wing](https://www.thoughtco.com/guide-to-the-irish-republican-army-3209135) of the Provisional IRA.
1.1.1.5.6.1.2. Pro: A solution involving [interreligious power sharing](http://www.mepc.org/power-sharing-syria-lessons-lebanons-taif-experience) rather than partition was instrumental in enabling multiple religious and ethnic groups to live peacefully together in Lebanon following the country's civil war.
1.1.1.5.6.1.2.1. Con: Part of the origin of the Lebanese Civil War lies in the large-scale influx of Palestinian refugees after the war in 1948. The resulting change in the population's composition and the lack of economic opportunities for refugees led to power struggles among Muslims and Christians. If anything, a joint state of Palestinians with Israel would create similar conditions as those that led to the Civil War in Lebanon.
1.1.1.5.6.1.2.1.1. Con: Yet this civil war was one that ultimately led to peace and power-sharing between the various groups. There is no reason why this could not happen in a one state incorporating both Palestinians and Israelis.
1.1.1.5.6.1.2.2. Con: Because of its sectarian divisions, Lebanon is a country that is notorious for its political instability. If anything, it is an example of the problems that states with long-standing ethnic and religious divisions suffer.
1.1.1.5.6.1.3. Pro: Maoist rebels in Nepal [now successfully share power](https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/117620/Nepal%20Policy%20Brief.pdf) in the country's government, through an agreement that ended a long-running civil war.
1.1.1.5.6.1.4. Con: 71% of attempted power-sharing agreements in Asia between 1989 and 2006 [failed due to a resumption of fighting](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/05/study-half-of-government-rebel-power-sharing-agreements-fail/).
1.1.1.5.6.1.5. Con: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict possesses an almost uniquely problematic combination of ethnic, religious, ideological and nationalist animosity, making it particularly difficult to solve.
1.1.1.5.6.1.5.1. Con: This idea has been rejected because a solution that all involved actors have signaled principal support for has been found: two separate states. What makes this conflict intractable is the lack of "courageous leadership" on the sides of Israel, Palestinians as well as the United States \([Quandt, p. 8](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=WV7uBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=israel+palestine+uniquely+complex&source=bl&ots=HzUtkCg9G8&sig=5IKnwOJvqNk_PMGNSAia5kNfeok&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiR-dGQsvXTAhXBq5QKHZRNDg4Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=israel%20palestine%20uniquely%20complex&f=false)\).
1.1.1.5.6.1.5.1.1. Con: There is little reason to expect a change in leadership style from any of the actors involved anytime soon. A lack of courageous leadership is part of what makes this conflict intractable.
1.1.1.5.6.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.2.
1.1.1.5.6.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: The American political establishment effectively filters out the candidates that do not conform to certain [attitudes](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/opinion/sunday/roger-cohen-why-americans-see-israel-the-way-they-do.html?_r=0) towards Israel and Palestine.
1.1.1.5.6.1.5.1.1.3. Pro: Israel's [Netanyahu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu) has served three terms as Prime Minister. The fact that Israelis have consistently voted him in serves to show that they approve of his approach to the Palestinian question.
1.1.1.5.6.1.5.2. Pro: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict [has been categorized](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-t-coleman-phd/the-mathematics-of-middle_b_887723.html) as one of the approximately 5% of conflicts that become intractable.
1.1.1.5.6.2. Pro: Hamas is unlikely to let go of control in Gaza.
1.1.1.5.6.2.1. Pro: Keeping hostilities going and even going to war periodically with Israel ensures the survival of Hamas. In order to go to war, Hamas needs to be in control of territory within Palestine, for which purpose it will hold on to Gaza.
1.1.1.5.6.2.1.1. Pro: Hamas [fears](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4707/what-does-hamas-want) that Palestinians will eventually tire of a military approach to the conflict. A war with Israel leads to countless deaths of innocent Palestinians: this fuels Palestinian hatred for Israel and paints Hamas as soldiers fighting for the Palestinians.
1.1.1.5.6.2.1.2. Con: If Palestinians were to have a stable state of their own, going to war would become far less attractive. This suggests that Hamas would very likely either have to moderate itself, or cease to have popular support.
1.1.1.5.6.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.5.1.
1.1.1.5.6.2.2. Pro: In 2015, 39% of Palestinians in Gaza said they would [vote for Hamas](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20150610-poll-hamas-popularity-up-in-gaza-west-bank/), more than any other political group. This would make it a strong political actor in the region.
1.1.1.5.6.2.3. Pro: Hamas was [founded](https://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/880818a.htm) with the explicit purpose of destroying the state of Israel - ruling Gaza gives Hamas the foothold in Palestine it needs to be able to launch attacks against Israel.
1.1.1.5.6.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.5.5.1.
1.1.1.5.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.
1.1.1.5.6.4. Pro: Hamas has been classified as a terrorist organization since 1997 by the [US State Department](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm).
1.1.1.5.6.4.1. Con: Many terrorist groups have been allowed to join the political systems of recognized governments, despite the legitimacy it brings to these groups.
1.1.1.5.6.4.1.1. Pro: The post-Apartheid government of South Africa is led by the ANC \(African National Congress\), an organization the [US had formerly labeled](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/us-government-considered-nelson-mandela-terrorist-until-2008-f2D11708787) as a terrorist group.
1.1.1.5.6.4.1.2. Pro: The Kosovo Liberation Army \(KLA\) was [described as a terrorist group by US officials](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/terrorist-groups-and-political-legitimacy) before eventually forming part of the government and armed forces of the \(partially recognized\) country.
1.1.1.5.6.4.1.3. Con: These groups were largely not opposed to US foreign policy when they were legitimized by the US. Hamas, on the other hand, [has threatened attacks](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15617830/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/hamas-calls-muslims-attack-us-targets/#.WSdBL2iGNeU) against the US.
1.1.1.5.6.4.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.5.1.
1.1.1.5.6.4.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.5.2.
1.1.1.5.6.4.2. Con: The US is classed as a terrorist organisation by many of its victims. But the US is a superpower, its victims are not - so US definitions have cultural dominance. This doesn't make them right.
1.1.1.5.6.4.2.1. Pro: The US classified the African National Congress as a terrorist organization until 2008.
1.1.1.5.6.4.3. Con: Hamas is a terrorist organisation in part because it is not a government. No democratically elected government is seen as a terrorist organisation and Hamas would be no different.
1.1.1.5.6.4.3.1. Con: Countries can still be [labelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-sponsored_terrorism) as state sponsors of terrorism.
1.1.1.5.6.4.4. Con: The designation of "[terrorist organization](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm)" is an arbitrary distinction that does not necessarily reflect the manner of violence, the scale of violence, or the threat to the United States. The designation is based only on political concerns.
1.1.1.6. Pro: As of 2009, a majority of Palestinians were willing to accept or even embrace a continuation of the political status quo under the condition that the Palestinian territories would be able to develop economically \([Irwin, p. 4](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)\).
1.1.1.6.1. Pro: Asked about the most serious problems confronting Palestinian society today, slightly more Palestinians name unemployment and poverty than occupation and settlements. The economy is thus of at least as much relevance to Palestinians than the political situation \([PSR, p. 1f.](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)\).
1.1.1.6.1.1. Con: Economic problems are the [result](http://www.ps.undp.org/content/papp/en/home/countryinfo.html) of occupation and settlements; so in fact, concern about the economy indicates that the political status quo is of great importance to Palestinians.
1.1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Economic mobility within the West Bank is hindered substantially by a system of [blockades and checkpoints](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/oct/14/palestine-economy-how-does-it-work). Given that these are maintained for security reasons to prevent terrorist attacks, Israel will never agree to lift them.
1.1.1.6.1.1.2. Pro: Gaza's economic development is crippled by the [Israeli blockade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip), which is maintained for security reasons; given that lifting it would result in increased rocket and terrorist attacks, Israel would never agree to lift the blockade and allow Gaza to develop.
1.1.1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.2.1.
1.1.1.6.3. Con: The status quo will never result in economic development for the Palestinian territories due to a set of systemic factors.
1.1.1.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.1.1.1.
1.1.1.6.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.1.1.2.
1.1.1.6.4. Con: The attitude of Palestinians has probably changed dramatically since 2009, especially considering major events since then like the [2014 war in Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict).
1.1.1.6.5. Pro: Palestine's economic development could be spurred without resorting to a two-state solution. As the UN [argues](http://www.ps.undp.org/content/papp/en/home/countryinfo.html), "Israeli-imposed economic restrictions continue to constrain sustainable economic growth" in Palestine. Therefore, by removing these restrictions, it would be possible to promote economic growth without large-scale political changes.
1.1.2. Con: There exists no viable alternative to the two-state solution. Even if Palestinians don't consider a partition to be their ideal outcome, this is the only realistic solution that they can hope to achieve.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Partition was [agreed upon by the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine) and enjoys its [continued support](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/UN-chief-No-alternative-to-two-state-solution-for-Israel-Palestinians-481615).
1.1.2.1.1. Con: If Palestinians and Israelis were both opposed to a two-state solution, the UN would presumably shift its support to a reasonable alternative arrangement that the sides were more in agreement on.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: The UN view doesn't represent what Israelis and Palestinians think.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Partition has solved multiple conflicts and civil wars, including in [the Balkans](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-09-14/syria-at-peace-to-imagine-it-think-of-bosnia-) and [Sudan](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/world/africa/10sudan.html).
1.1.2.2.1. Con: History knows many examples where deeply rooted ethnic or religious animosities were overcome, such as in [Rwanda](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/06/magazine/06-pieter-hugo-rwanda-portraits.html) or [Ireland](https://www.dfa.ie/our-role-policies/northern-ireland/the-good-friday-agreement-and-today/).
1.1.2.2.2. Con: The Sudanese peace agreement is far from [solving anything](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/emergency-response/south-sudan/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoc_f6_Hd1wIVlYl-Ch3v9Qe8EAAYASAAEgJsy_D_BwE).
1.1.2.3. Con: Israel has repeatedly waged war against the Gaza Strip in recent years. From the Israeli perspective, diplomacy is probably a lost cause in this conflict. No matter what the US does, Israel won't come back to the negotiating table.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.6.1.3.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: Israeli aggression towards Palestinians is not indicative of a lack of faith in the peace process, but rather a response to Palestinian terrorism. If a two-state solution were established and Palestinian terrorism dropped as a result, Israel would simply stop invading.
1.1.2.3.3. Con: Israel can wage war against the Palestinians because it knows it can rely on US support to deflect international criticism and scrutiny. The American recognition of Palestine would force Israel to change the way it approaches the conflict.
1.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.1.3.
1.1.2.5. Con: A one-state solution encompassing both Israel and Palestine would allow both ethnoreligious groups to inhabit the same space in peace.
1.1.2.5.1. Pro: Palestinians and Israelis both have strong claims to the land. Living together in the same state is the only way to satisfy these claims.
1.1.2.5.1.1. Con: A two-state solution, which gives some of the land to Israelis and some to Palestinians, respects the claim-rights of both groups.
1.1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Many of these claims are overlapping, for example in Jerusalem, hence it is difficult to imagine a two-state solution that would be able to satisfy all parties.
1.1.2.5.2. Pro: The number of Arabs in Israel/Palestine is [roughly equal to the number of Jews](http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-israel-the-demographic-issue-gains-resonance/), meaning that each group would have roughly equal political power.
1.1.2.5.2.1. Con: There are currently more than three million Palestinian refugees registered with the UN in [Jordan](https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/jordan), [Lebanon](https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/lebanon) and [Syria](https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/syria). If only a fraction of those return, this will tip the population balance in favor of Arabs.
1.1.2.5.2.2. Con: [Demographic trends](http://mondoweiss.net/2014/02/population-israelpalestine-projected/) are bound to change this situation in favor of the Arab population: within a decade, Jews are expected to make up less than half the population in Israel and Palestine, whereas the Arab share will grow to more than half.
1.1.2.5.2.2.1. Pro: The Palestinian population is set to [outnumber](http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/328404/palestinian-population-to-pass-jews-by-2017-in-israel-and-territories/) the Jewish population by the end of 2017.
1.1.2.5.2.3. Con: However, Jews certainly do not want to give up the power that they currently hold by sharing it with Arabs.
1.1.2.5.2.4. Pro: [Statistics indicate](http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-israel-the-demographic-issue-gains-resonance/) there are 6.1 million Jews and nearly 5.8 million Arabs living in the so-called 'Holy Land'.
1.1.2.5.3. Con: About 60% of Palestinians and about 70% of Israelis oppose the idea of a joint state with equal rights for all citizens \([PSR, p. 10](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf); [Irwin, p. 4](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)\).
1.1.2.5.3.1. Pro: Palestinians disagree with the idea that the land west of the Jordan River should become part a of joint state. As of 2009, about 70% saw an Islamic State and 80% a Palestinian state on this territory as "essential" or desirable" \([Irwin, p. 4](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)\). A joint state with the mostly Jewish people of Israel would be neither Islamic nor Palestinian in nature.
1.1.2.5.4. Con: The Arab citizens of Israel already experience large-scale discrimination and feel treated as second-class citizens or [even enemies](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3391545,00.html), even though they are legally equal to other citizens. Judging from this, Israel has probably little interest in a joint state with Palestinians as equals.
1.1.2.5.4.1. Pro: The Arab citizens of Israel perceive the current condition of their country as worse than its Jewish citizens: 24% of the former see Israel being in a good or very good condition whereas 42% of Jews do \([PSR, p. 1](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)\). This indicates that Arab citizens are not satisfied with their situation.
1.1.2.5.4.2. Pro: Israel is characterized by inequality along ethnic lines. More than half of all Arab families in Israel are classified as poor compared to a fifth of Jewish households; the life expectancy of Arabs is about four years lower than that of Jews, their infant mortality about twice as high \([Adalah, p. 8-10](https://www.adalah.org/uploads/oldfiles/upfiles/2011/Adalah_The_Inequality_Report_March_2011.pdf)\).
1.1.2.5.4.3. Pro: An official one-state solution would [massively increase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories#Demographics) the number of Arab Israeli citizens, increasing their ability to collectivize and resist Jewish power.
1.1.2.5.4.4. Pro: About [half of all Israeli Jews](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/08/key-findings-religion-politics-israel/) voice in opinion polls that Arabs should be transferred or even expelled from Israel.
1.1.2.5.4.5. Pro: [Eight out of ten](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/05/25/most-israeli-jews-do-not-see-a-lot-of-discrimination-in-their-society/) Israeli Arabs believe that there is already "a lot" of discrimination against Arabs taking place in Israel.
1.1.2.5.4.6. Pro: [Only](https://www.idi.org.il/media/4849/madad_2010_eng_abstract.pdf) 51% of Jewish citizens of Israel support full equality in rights between Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel. 86% believe that critical decisions for the state should be taken only by a Jewish majority.
1.1.2.5.4.6.1. Con: Nothing can be read into the opinions of ordinary Jews on whether ordinary Jews should occupy a privileged position. Everyone would secretly like more power for themselves.
1.1.2.5.5. Con: Israel would [never](http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-israel-the-demographic-issue-gains-resonance/) agree to granting citizenship to all Palestinians since that would threaten the ability of Israel to remain a politically Jewish state.
1.1.2.5.5.1. Pro: If able to choose one among a democratic Israel, peace, a Greater Israel and Israel with a Jewish majority, the latter is the most popular option among Israeli Jews \([PSR, p. 14](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)\).
1.1.2.5.5.2. Pro: Israel was founded in order to provide a safe haven to Jews, and its ability to fulfill this function is contingent on political control being maintained by Jews. A one-state solution would threaten Jewish maintenance of political control.
1.1.2.5.5.2.1. Con: The purpose for which Israel was founded has been fulfilled, and should no longer determine the political state of Israel. Jews no longer need a safe haven in the way they did back when Israel was established.
1.1.2.5.5.2.1.1. Con: Jews still need a safe haven. Anti-Semitism is [rising in Europe](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-francis-anti-semitism-european-jewish-congress-moshe-kantor-populism-donald-trump-hitler-a7544886.html) and hate crimes against Jews are [still frequent in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_the_United_States#Hate_crimes_against_Jews_in_the_U.S.).
1.1.2.5.5.2.2. Pro: There are [6.1 million Jews and 5.8 million Arabs](http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-israel-the-demographic-issue-gains-resonance/) living in the Israel/Palestine geographic area. This near-parity in population sizes means that constant Jewish political control would be highly unlikely.
1.1.2.5.5.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.2.1.
1.1.2.5.5.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.2.2.
1.1.2.5.5.3. Con: Zionism should be considered an outdated concept from the time when colonization was an acceptable practice.
1.1.2.5.5.4. Con: There is no objective reason why there has to be a purely Jewish state.
1.1.2.5.5.4.1. Pro: Pakistan is the only other country in the world based on a religion, where demographics were [actively changed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Pakistan#Independence_and_transfer_of_population) to make this goal a reality. We don't laud them for that.
1.1.2.5.6. Con: The mutual perceptions in this conflict make it very difficult to bring people together. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians would likely continue within the new state.
1.1.2.5.6.1. Pro: 75% of Palestinians say that it is not possible to trust Israeli Jews; almost 70% of Israeli Jews say that it is not possible to trust Palestinians \([PSR, p. 10](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)\).
1.1.2.5.6.2. Pro: About half of Palestinians support attacks on Israelis such as stabbings \([PSR, p. 11](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)\).
1.1.2.5.6.3. Con: These perceptions might change quickly once the political realities change and Palestinians and Israelis do not see each other as opponents anymore.
1.1.2.5.6.3.1. Pro: Interpersonal relations show potential. The Israelis and Palestinians who talk to individuals of the other group describe these conversations generally as pleasant \([PSR, p. 12](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)\).
1.1.2.5.6.3.2. Con: A decades-long history of bloodshed means that current perceptions are strongly entrenched both in Israeli and Palestinian culture.
1.1.2.5.6.4. Pro: According to a 2015 survey, [93% of Palestinians](http://global100.adl.org/#country/west-bank-and-gaza/2014) hold anti-Semitic views. It is unlikely a recognition of Israel as a Jewish state will do anything to solve this principal animosity.
1.1.2.5.7. Con: Palestinians want, first and foremost, a state of their own as Palestinian Arab people. In 1988 their parliament thus adopted a [declaration of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Declaration_of_Independence). Ever since, November 15 is celebrated as Independence Day in Palestine.
1.1.2.5.7.1. Pro: Indeed, among all imaginable scenarios for the region, none is more unpopular in Israel and only one is more unpopular among Palestinians than a joint state \([Irwin, p. 4](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)\).
1.1.2.5.7.2. Con: The citizenship of Palestinians in a joint state with Israelis that ensures equal rights for everybody could deliver this independence.
1.1.2.5.7.2.1. Con: In a joint state with the people of Israel, the Palestinians would most certainly not be able to achieve independence and determine their own fate due to mutual dependencies between the two groups.
1.1.2.5.8. Pro: Reports on polls indicate that more Israelis \(39%\) support a [joint state for the two peoples](https://knessetjeremy.com/2016/12/30/smith-poll-39-1-state-for-2-peoples-31-annex-settlement-blocks-30-2-states-for-2-peoples-based-on-1967-lines/) than support a two-state solution \(30%\).
1.1.2.5.8.1. Con: At the same time, this poll implies that six out of ten Israelis prefer solutions other than a single state for both peoples.
1.1.2.5.9. Con: There is hardly any successful precedent for a merger of two nations with a decade-long history of armed conflict and differences along ethnic as well as religious lines.
1.1.2.5.9.1. Pro: There are various examples of states that broke up because of ethnic and religious fault lines, for example Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Sudan. These cases hold a lesson for future attempts at creating multi-ethnic and multi-religious states.
1.1.2.5.9.2. Con: The history of most modern nation-states involved the combination of two or more independent political entities who had fought against each other in the past.
1.1.2.5.9.2.1. Pro: The United Kingdom is a union of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, which resolved many wars between these groups.
1.1.2.5.9.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.
1.1.2.5.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.6.1.5.
1.1.2.5.10. Pro: Israel's current President, Reuven Rivlin, has said that he would rather [accept Palestinians as Israeli citizens](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-official-accepting-palestinians-into-israel-better-than-two-states-1.287421) than accept the creation of a Palestinian state.
1.1.2.5.11. Pro: A similar solution was implemented in Lebanon, where the conflicting parties entered an [inter-religious power sharing agreement](https://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2015/08/27/things-to-know-about-lebanons-government/). This has allowed the various religious and ethnic groups within Lebanon to live peacefully together.
1.1.2.5.11.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.5.6.1.2.2.
1.1.2.5.12. Pro: As of 2009, a joint state with Palestinians and Israelis as equal citizens was unacceptable to only a minority of Palestinians; the majority would at least be willing to tolerate or even embrace this solution \([Irving, p. 4](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)\).
1.1.2.6. Con: There are alternatives. I.e. the arab areas west of the Jordan could be put under Jordan administration with Israel still in control of the borders and Gaza administered by Egypt.
1.1.2.7. Con: Despite this supposedly obvious fact, attempts at negotiating a two-state solution have consistently failed for decades.
1.1.2.7.1. Con: Israel consistently imposes a double standard on the peace process, where it lays out conditions of [recognition and demilitarisation](http://www.haaretz.com/news/full-text-of-netanyahu-s-foreign-policy-speech-at-bar-ilan-1.277922) for peace negotiations yet refuses to let Palestinians set their own pre-conditions. US recognition of Palestine will signal that Israel cannot just demand recognition without reciprocating it.
1.1.2.7.2. Con: US recognition of Palestine might get Israel back to the negotiation table by indicating the American support is not unconditional. Right now, Israel can refuse to return to negotiations despite strong international pressure because it perceives its US support as unconditional.
1.1.2.7.2.1. Pro: Israel believes that [under Republican administrations](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/8/11175136/donald-trump-benjamin-netanyahu-gop), it has free rein to do whatever it wants without any risk of jeopardizing its relationship with the US. Showing that a Republican president is willing to exert pressure for peace would force Israel to become more accountable.
1.1.2.7.2.2. Pro: The Obama administration's decision to [break](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-declines-to-veto-un-security-council-resolution-for-israel-to-stop-jewish-settlement-activity/2016/12/23/cd4efe72-c939-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html?utm_term=.43b2a1267411) a long tradition of vetoing UN Security Council resolutions criticising Israel was seen as a [strong rebuke](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/23/world/middleeast/israel-settlements-un-vote.html) of Israel, and if the Obama administration had remained in office, it would have been seen as a major shift in US policy towards Israel.
1.1.2.7.2.2.1. Con: The Obama administration could afford to allow the resolution to pass because it was near the end of the administration's tenure, and because the election had already happened. Under [normal circumstances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_UN_resolutions_concerning_Israel_and_Palestine), an American administration would never have the political support to do something like this.
1.1.2.7.2.3. Con: Recognition of Palestine is largely symbolic, and a willingness to do so does not signal a willingness to more substantively exert pressure on Israel \(for example, by cutting military aid\), so Israel will continue to act with impunity.
1.1.2.7.2.3.1. Pro: The US's unfailing support for Israel is the product of a set of [political factors](http://www.vox.com/2014/7/24/5929705/us-israel-friends) that will remain for the foreseeable future, so it is highly unlikely that the US will ever substantively reduce the degree of its support for Israel.
1.1.2.7.2.3.2. Con: The symbolic gesture in question is massive and unprecedented; a willingness to do it signals a general shift in attitude towards Israel on the part of the US, and Israel would be very worried about that shift in attitude.
1.1.2.7.3. Con: The consistent failure of past peace negotiations makes it seem like peace talks are destined to fail. However, they have failed due to random, unpredictable, external setbacks, not internal factors that make a peace process impossible. US recognition of Palestine is required to force Israel back to the negotiating table.
1.1.2.7.3.1. Pro: The [Taba Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taba_Summit#End_of_the_negotiations) was organised in 2001 by Clinton as a last ditch effort to reach a peace deal before his administration ended. According to the statement issued by the negotiators at the end of the talks, they came closer to reaching a final settlement than in any previous peace talks, however upcoming Israeli elections meant that they could not be continued.
1.1.2.7.3.2. Pro: [Recent negotiations](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.775258) between Netanyahu and the Israeli leader of the opposition indicated plans for dramatic moves towards territorial compromise and peace, but the Amona Crisis destroyed the negotiations.
1.1.2.7.3.2.1. Con: The negotiations failed when Netanyahu [consciously decided](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/us-offered-israel-secret-peace-deal-in-2016-but-netanyahu-walked-away-a7588526.html) not to allow the opposition party into his coalition.
1.1.2.7.3.3. Pro: The Oslo Accords, signed in 1993 and 1995, ultimately failed due to [Yitzhak Rabin's assassination](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/shot-in-the-heart).
1.1.2.7.3.4. Pro: Peace talks [in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_peace_process#Israeli.E2.80.93Palestinian_talks_in_2007_and_2009) failed in part because of Olmert's [resignation on charges of corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Olmert#Stepping_down).
1.1.2.7.3.5. Con: Peace talks have consistently failed for several decades. The consistency of this failure cannot be explained by random chance, and indicates that there are systematic underlying factors which make peace impossible to achieve.
1.1.2.7.3.5.1. Con: The [Madrid Talks in 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Conference_of_1991#The_impact_of_the_Madrid_Peace_Conference) were broadly successful, leaving all parties feeling hopeful about the peace process, indicating that a resolution is possible.
1.1.2.7.3.5.1.1. Con: Yet the lack of progress on these talks indicates that a resolution is not possible.
1.1.2.7.3.5.2. Con: The Oslo Accords were [successfully negotiated and signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords), and the only [reason](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ssfc0005/The%20Rise%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20Oslo%20Peace%20Process.html) they were ultimately unsuccessful was the assassination of Rabin.
1.1.3. Pro: Promoting a two-state solution against resistance would repeat what has failed in the past: external pressure and the promotion of large-scale change, for example in the form of peace and a two-state solution. Smaller steps forward might be a more feasible alternative.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The promotion of large-scale schemes for change in a top-down manner only reproduces polarization. Instead, change should be through a bottom-up process and by capitalizing on existing ties on the ground level, for example the work of NGOs and citizen initiatives \([Coleman, p. 213](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=bQf9drmDYZcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+five+percent&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Yet the work of NGOs and citizen initiatives is handicapped by policies imposed from above: Palestinians will not trust Israelis when they can't find a job, can't travel in their own land, can't meet their own families because of arbitrarily imposed checkpoints, and don't have access to basic goods and necessities because of Israeli restrictions imposed on the borders.
1.1.3.2. Pro: [Decoupling](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-five-percent/201205/the-decade-peace-in-israel-palestine) the Israeli-Palestine conflict from larger regional and world political issues \(e.g. relations with Iran\) would have the potential to simplify the process of seeking solutions.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Decoupling would lead to a [failed policy](https://theweichertreport.com/2017/05/28/the-linkage-between-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict-and-iran/) - Israel's oppressive counter-terrorism and security measures are the result of an Iranian threat. By ignoring Iranian funding of militant groups in Palestine such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Israel will never agree to withdraw from the occupied territories.
1.1.3.3. Con: The US can accelerate the peace process without directly interfering. For example, it could [neglect to veto](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/u-s-vetoes-of-un-security-council-resolutions-critical-to-israel) Security Council resolutions that punish Israeli behaviour counterproductive to peace, like settlement-building.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.
1.1.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.3.
1.1.4. Pro: Many Palestinians do not themselves support the two-state plan the US will base its recognition on. This makes it unlikely that such a plan will ever be successfully adopted.
1.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.5.5.1.1.
1.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.4.3. Pro: [Two thirds](https://mosaicmagazine.com/essay/2017/04/do-palestinians-want-a-two-state-solution/) of Palestinians reject the idea of East Jerusalem becoming the capital of a Palestinian state with West Jerusalem being controlled by Israel.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: According to a 2009 poll, nine out of ten Palestinians see it as "essential" that all of Jerusalem comes under Palestinian control; splitting the city according to the 1967 borders was "unacceptable" to half of all Palestinians \([Irwin, p. 11](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)\).
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: This issue is a major obstacle: eight out of ten Palestinians voiced in 2009 that no deal with Israel should proceed as long as there is no agreement on Jerusalem \([Irwin, p. 11](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)\).
1.1.4.4. Pro: [Two thirds](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/676) of Palestinians believe that the two-state solution is no longer a viable way forward due to the already existing and expanding Israeli settlements.
1.1.4.4.1. Con: This is a judgement about the current viability of a two-state solution, not its desirability. Palestinians would likely support a two-state solution and believe in its viability if Israel showed a stronger interest in achieving peace.
1.1.4.5. Pro: There is [no clear support](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/636) for a two-state solution among Palestinians with roughly equal numbers expressing support and opposition to the idea.
1.1.4.6. Con: Palestinians would welcome a show of US resolve in this question. As of 2009, eight out of ten saw the American lack of resolve as a major contributor to the lack of progress in the peace process, second only to Israeli unwillingness \([Irwin, p. 18](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)\).
1.1.4.6.1. Con: Almost eight out of ten Palestinians believe that the Trump administration is pro-Israel. Any American initiative will thus probably be received skeptically \([PSR, p. 8](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)\).
1.1.4.6.2. Con: Only some 4% of Palestinians welcome a peace-process driven by the United States. They would rather see the negotiations be led by the EU, the UN, Russia and the US together, or Arab nations - or bilateral talks with Israel \([PSR, p. 7f.](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)\).
1.1.4.6.2.1. Con: This is likely coloured by the failure of US-led talks in the past. If the US were to recognise Palestine and actively engage in diplomatic and trade relations, Palestinian public opinion of the US will surely change.
1.1.4.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.6.1.
1.1.4.6.3. Con: More than half of Palestinians want the Trump administration to stay out of the peace process \([PSR, p. 13](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/poll%2062%20English%20full%20text.pdf)\).
1.1.4.7. Con: Even if they do not support the American agenda as a whole, [nearly half](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/676) of all Palestinians believe that the primary goal of their nation should be to establish a Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital, which is in line with the U.S. plans.
1.1.4.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.
1.1.4.8. Con: [59%](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/678) of Palestinians express support for a particular two-state plan, conditional on a peace deal between Israel and all nearby Arab states.
1.1.4.8.1. Con: Israelis have already offered Palestinian statehood, only to be rejected three separate times, more then once due to the [unwillingness](https://www.algemeiner.com/2014/02/18/palestinian-arabs-the-people-who-always-refuse-a-state/) of the Palestinians to recognize Israel's right to exist. Lack of trust on the Israelis side is understandable when factions of the Palestinians in Gaza actively wish to commit genocide.
1.1.4.8.2. Con: It's not relevant whether Palestinians support a two state solution or not, the only relevant factor is whether the Palestinian leadership supports a two state solutions and there is no evidence that they do.
1.1.4.8.2.1. Con: The public's stance on the issue matters as any government that signs an agreement against the wishes of its constituents might provoke a backlash that could threaten its rule - and possibly bring more radical forces to power.
1.1.4.9. Pro: Currently, only [a minority of Palestinians](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/678) accept Israel as the homeland of its people.
1.1.4.9.1. Pro: Palestinian textbooks display a [world without Israel](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/new-palestinian-textbooks-present-a-world-without-israel-february-2007) and [incite](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/congressional-statement-on-palestinian-textbooks-july-2005) antisemitic feelings. Anti-Jewish feelings are thereby ingrained in the fabric of Palestinian society. A simple recognition cannot change this over night.
1.1.4.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.6.4.
1.1.4.10. Pro: Israel has already offered Palestine sovereignty on multiple occasions since Israels statehood. The Palestinians repeatedly reject it.
1.1.4.10.1. Pro: President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority has repeatedly rejected peace plans.
1.1.4.10.1.1. Con: Abbas has consistently, and [recently](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/05/03/remember-the-two-state-solution-abbas-does/), accepted the two-state solution. Rejection of individual peace plans because of their flaws is not the same as rejecting the two-state solution itself.
1.1.4.10.1.2. Con: Israel has also rejected peace plans, yet that does not mean it has rejected the two-state solution.
1.1.4.10.1.2.1. Pro: Netanyahu [rejected](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Report-Netanyahu-rejected-peace-plan-proposed-by-Kerry-at-secret-2016-meeting-481969) a peace plan proposed by former US Secretary of State John Kerry in a secret 2016 meeting.
1.1.4.10.1.2.2. Pro: Israel [rejected](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1547036/Israel-rejects-Arab-peace-initiative.html) an Arab peace initiative in 2007.
1.1.4.10.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.13.3.1.
1.1.4.10.1.4. Pro: US officials blame Abbas for '[shutting down](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/indyk-netanyahu-and-abbas-loathe-each-other/373922/)' during the 2014 peace negotiations, even though Israel was prepared for an agreement.
1.1.4.10.1.4.1. Con: Abbas had [no choice](https://newrepublic.com/article/118751/how-israel-palestine-peace-deal-died) but to walk away from those negotiations as Israel refused to stop expanding its settlements, a move designed to undermine Abbas and portray him as having made a peace deal by selling off Palestinian land.
1.1.4.10.1.5. Pro: A US-European draft resolution at the UN Security Council that would have extended the Palestinian Authority's authority to the Gaza Strip and stipulated the immediate start of reconstruction was [rejected](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20150227-pa-rejects-draft-resolution-to-extend-its-control-of-the-gaza-strip/) by the Palestinian Authority itself.
1.1.4.10.1.6. Pro: P.L.O. chief Mahmoud Abbas has pledged, repeatedly, over decades that he will [never, ever recognize Israel](http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-fiery-speech-abbas-rejects-jerusalem-concessions/) as the Jewish state, meaning he will never recognize Israel.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1. Con: Abbas refuses to recognise Israel as a Jewish state specifically, not as a state overall. There is a crucial difference.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.1. Pro: Palestinians are asking only for recognition of Palestine as a state, not as a Palestinian or a Muslim state. Their refusal to recognise Israel as a Jewish state specifically is therefore not hypocritical.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2. Pro: Not recognizing Israel as a Jewish state is meant to protect the rights of [the quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Israel) of Israel's population that is not Jewish.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Recognizing a state as solely belonging to a religious or ethnic group is exclusionary and unnecessary.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.1.1. Con: Israel is unique; it was founded as [a Jewish state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration) in response to thousands of years of global anti-Semitism culminating in the Holocaust.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Given that in order to fulfill its founding purpose, Israel must remain a Jewish state, Israel can legitimately demand of other nations that they recognise its right to remain a Jewish state.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.5.2.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.1.1.3. Con: Israel can serve its founding purpose without demanding recognition as a Jewish state from other countries.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Demanding recognition as a Jewish state is part of fighting the thousands of years of antisemitism that Israel was founded to combat, because failing to recognize the Jewish people's right to self determination and to identify as Jewish is antisemitic.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.1.2. Pro: About [20%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel#Population) of Israel's population are Arabs, so recognition of Israel as Jewish excludes a fifth of Israel's population.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.2. Con: Recognition of Israel as Jewish state does not compromise the rights of Arab citizens in Israel \([Becker, p. 1](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus108.pdf)\).
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.4.5.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.4.4.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.5. Pro: The Palestinian Authority [fears](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/03/arab-league-rejects-israel-as-jewish-state-201439161231209704.html) calling Israel a Jewish State will both increase and legitimise discrimination of Israel's Arab population.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.6. Con: The protection of the rights of minorities is a part of the founding narrative of Israel.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.6.1. Pro: [Zeev Jabotinsky](https://www.google.de/search?q=Zeev+Jabotinsky&oq=Zeev+Jabotinsky&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.503j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), one of the early Zionist leaders, was outspoken on minority protection \([Becker, p. 16](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus108.pdf)\).
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.6.2. Pro: The [Israeli Declaration of Independence](https://www.knesset.gov.il/docs/eng/megilat_eng.htm) highlights that the state will "ensure complete equality \[...\] to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion".
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.6.3. Con: [Israel's Declaration of Independence](http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/peace/guide/pages/declaration%20of%20establishment%20of%20state%20of%20israel.aspx) claims itself to be a Jewish state.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.6.3.1. Con: It's possible to be a Jewish state and still protect non-Jewish minorities - indeed, the very fact that a country recognises a minority identity implies that it also recognises a majority identity.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.6.4. Con: Israel was created by uprooting and re-settling more than [half a million](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/04/why-jewish-state-demand-non-star-20144814244225761.html) Palestinians. This does not highlight how minority protection is part of Israel's foundation.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.6.4.1. Con: Arab-Muslim citizens of the Mandate of Palestine were not a minority in the region at the time, particularly not in comparison to Jewish citizens and immigrants; in fact, Arab-Muslims dominate the middle east to this day.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.6.4.2. Con: There would have been no Arab-Israel War and no reason for those Palestinians to flee Israel, where they were a protected minority, had Israel not been invaded by every one of its Arab neighbours simultaneously in 1948.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.7. Con: The Supreme Court of Israel has made it clear that discrimination towards non-Jews is illegal \([CA 6698/95, p. 27](http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/95/980/066/a14/95066980.a14.pdf)\).
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.7.1. Con: Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, [found](https://www.adalah.org/uploads/oldfiles/upfiles/2011/Adalah_The_Inequality_Report_March_2011.pdf) that inequalities between Arab and Jewish citizens of Israel span all fields of public life and have persisted over time. Just because discrimination is illegal does not mean it does not exist.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.4.6.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.9. Pro: Citizenship rights for Jewish and Arab citizens are [not equal](https://www.adalah.org/uploads/oldfiles/upfiles/2011/Adalah_The_Inequality_Report_March_2011.pdf) \(p. 16\). This extends to laws around immigration and family unification.
1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.10. Pro: Over half of Arab families in Israel are classified as [poor](https://www.btl.gov.il/English%20Homepage/Publications/AnnualSurvey/2008/Pages/Thecompletesurvey.aspx) \(p. 80\), compared to an average poverty rate of one-fifth among all families in Israel. Arab towns and villages are heavily over-represented in the lowest socio-economic rankings, and the unrecognized Arab Bedouin villages in the Naqab are the poorest communities in the state.
1.1.4.10.1.6.2. Pro: As the [visual symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization) of PLO's desired state is the entire of Israel \([i.pinimg.com](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d0/ac/9f/d0ac9f0230592331fc208cba5bec40f5.jpg\))\) and the chant "From the river to the sea, Palestine will soon be free" indicates a continued wish to subsume all of mandatory Palestine into a "Palestinian" state, the concern over "Jewish" vs. "mere existence" is a cynical way to ignore true aims.
1.1.4.10.2. Pro: [Almost two thirds](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/676) of Palestinians support abandoning the Oslo Accords, and thereby the foundations of the American-supported peace talks.
1.1.4.11. Con: The US should concern itself with what will end the conflict, not what the Palestinians support. As the Palestinian leadership provides no clear understanding of its own ideas for progress, the recognition of Palestine would be at least a step forward.
1.1.4.12. Pro: As of 2009, the establishment of a historic Palestine from the Jordan river to the sea elicited significantly more support among Palestinians than a two-state solution; more than half even saw this as "desirable" or "essential" \([Irwin, p. 4](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)\).
1.1.4.12.1. Con: At the same time, two thirds of Palestinians expressed in the same poll that a two-state solution would be at least acceptable \([Irvin, p. 4](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)\).
1.1.4.12.2. Con: By all standards this solution is unrealistic as it would require Israel to be subsumed into a Palestinian state. This would be acceptable neither to Israel nor the international community.
1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.
1.1.6. Con: It is impossible to know what the effects of a two-state solution would be. One can only predict.
1.2. Con: The Jewish people have a strong religious and ancient claim to the Land of Palestine and thus are its rightful rulers.
1.2.1. Pro: Christian and Jewish holy texts, followed by over a billion people, delegate Israel to the Jews.
1.2.1.1. Con: [Some Christians believe](https://www.ucg.org/world-news-and-prophecy/palestine-israel-whose-land-is-it-really) that the Covenant of Abraham \(including ownership of the Land of Israel\) was expanded to everyone on Earth following transgressions made by his original Jewish descendants.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: If people are going to appeal to the Bible for an Israeli claim to the land they don't understand the Bible. It ultimately is not about real estate or a particular race. Israel is spiritual. Modern political Israel has nothing to do with it.
1.2.1.2. Pro: In [Genesis 12:7](http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm) and [15:18-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2015:18%E2%80%9321;&version=NIV;), God promised Greater Israel to the descendants of Abraham. Jews are the descendants of Abraham.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Genetically, Muslim Arabs in this region are semitic people and [descend](https://www.haaretz.com/science-and-health/palestinians-and-jews-share-genetic-roots-1.5411201) from Abraham as much as the Jews. They even have similar specific chromosomes and genes.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Textually, God explicitly limited this promise to the seed of Isaac \([Gen 21:10](https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8216#v=10) as endorsed by [21:12](https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8216#v=12) and [25:5](https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8220/jewish/Chapter-25.htm#v=5)\). This promise was then given to Jacob and his descendants \([Gen 28:4](https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8223#v=4)\).
1.2.1.3. Con: Holy texts [like the Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_the_Bible#Schools_of_archaeological_and_historical_thought) are not a good source to base modern land claims upon as they are notoriously unreliable and usually perceived to be not rooted in historic facts.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: International law is not based on religious justifications, as there is no way of evaluating such claims.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: Who cares about perception? Facts are all that matters. 1\) The claim is a strawman; modern zionists do not base their claim to the land of Israel on the Abrahamic covenant. The claim is based in part on [accepted history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_of_Titus) and [proven archeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Dan_Stele). 2\) Though it is a strawman ostensibly to be demolished, the argument is false. Far from being notoriously unreliable, Biblical claims are in fact [very reliable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siloam_inscription#Translation) in [historical fact](http://blog.dovidgottlieb.com/search/label/Biblical%20archaeology) where it is relevant to land claims.
1.2.1.3.3. Con: When the [holy](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=5&verse=21) [texts](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&verse=104) of each party to a dispute [agree](http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/islam-supports-israels-right-of-existence/), then it would be advantageous to use this as a basis to resolve the dispute. For example both the Quran and the Bible agree that the land of Israel belongs to the Jewish nation, who will eventually return.
1.2.1.4. Con: The claims in a religious text have no moral significance for ownership because the religions espoused within those texts are not true.
1.2.1.5. Pro: [Psalm 137](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/11981) commands Jews to never forget about Jerusalem.
1.2.1.6. Con: The number of followers a religion has tells us nothing about whether this religion's beliefs are more correct or relevant than any other religion's beliefs.
1.2.1.7. Pro: The Old Testament delineates the land of Israel in [Numbers 34:1-35:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2034-35:8) and [Ezekiel 47:13-23](http://www.biblica.com/bible/online-bible/?osis=niv:Ezekiel.47:13%E2%80%9320:13).
1.2.1.7.1. Con: This extract \([Numbers 34:1-35:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2034-35:8)\) says "Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities of refuge, to which a person who has killed someone may flee," which is not respected nowadays, so what was once, no longer is.
1.2.1.8. Con: Just because many people hold a belief does not make it true. Billions of people used to believe that the Earth is flat.
1.2.2. Pro: Some [Muslim scholars](http://www.meforum.org/2464/quran-covenant-with-jewish-people) even assign the Land of Israel \(including modern day Palestine\) to the Jews.
1.2.2.1. Pro: In [Qur'an 5:21](https://quran.com/5/21) Moses declares: "O my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned to you and do not turn back \[from fighting in Allah 's cause\] and \[thus\] become losers."
1.2.2.1.1. Con: This verse does not define the location, boundaries or borders of such a “Holy Land”, and does not state whether this land has been “assigned” for a specific period of time, or for eternity.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: Muslims believe that Moses was Muslim, and therefore one could make an argument that this “Holy Land” should now be under Muslim control.
1.2.2.2. Con: The Jewish Holy Torah recognizes that the land of Israel was the home for other and older tribes before the Israelites arrived : the Amorites and the Canaanites, the Hittites and the Perizzites, the Hivvites and the Jebusites. 
[Pentateuch Shemot 34:11-12](https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9895/jewish/Chapter-34.htm)
Thus according to the Torah, the Israelites descendants are not the most ancient inhabitants.
1.2.3. Con: Jerusalem is of great religious significance to Muslims, and is considered to be the [third holiest site](http://www.pij.org/details.php?id=646) in Islam.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Jerusalem was the first [qibla](https://www.al-islam.org/the-message-ayatullah-jafar-subhani/chapter-29-change-qiblah), or direction of prayer, for Muslims, before the qibla became Mecca.
1.2.3.2. Pro: It is the city from where Muhammad [ascended](http://www.jerusalem.com/articles/islam/muhammads_night_journey_to_jerusalem-a6295) to heaven and met Allah. It is an important religious event that is [celebrated](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/27/lailat-al-miraj-2014_n_5395082.html) by Muslims every year throughout the world.
1.2.3.3. Con: Jerusalem [appears](http://www.danielpipes.org/84/the-muslim-claim-to-jerusalem) in the Hebrew Bible 669 times and Zion \(which usually means Jerusalem, sometimes the Land of Israel\) 154 times, or 823 times in all. The Christian Bible mentions Jerusalem 154 times and Zion 7 times. Yet the Quran does not mention it once.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: Even though the Quran does not mention Jerusalem itself, it [refers to](https://quran.com/17/1) the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem's old town.
1.2.3.3.2. Con: It is questionable whether references in holy scriptures are the appropriate standard to judge religious significance. The Bible does not mention the Vatican, the Pope or cardinals at any point, yet these stand at the center of the Catholic Church.
1.2.3.4. Con: Jerusalem has historically been used as a [political tool](http://www.danielpipes.org/84/the-muslim-claim-to-jerusalem) by Islamic empires. There is little religious importance affiliated with the city that outweighs Judaism's three thousand year old connection.
1.2.4. Pro: In ancient times the West Bank was part of Israel for a millennia starting with the [Kingdom of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_\(united_monarchy\)) in 1050 BCE to the [Herodian Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodian_kingdom) 4 BCE. Indeed, Jews led the first independent polity in the region.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Unlike the existence of an ancient Jewish sovereign over this land, there has never been a Palestinian state, nor, until recently, did Palestinians have a separate identity. They saw themselves as part of a larger Arab Syria \([Bard, p. 3](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/mf2017.pdf#page=43)\).
1.2.4.1.1. Con: Accounts of past Jewish sovereignty on the disputed territories are based on historical accounts not backed up by research and archaeological evidence.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: There is [a lack of archaeological evidence](http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/archaeology/.premium-1.575418) for the existence of King David. The stories of who he was and what he did are conflicting and give no coherent account.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The [Tel Dan Inscription](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-artifacts/artifacts-and-the-bible/the-tel-dan-inscription-the-first-historical-evidence-of-the-king-david-bible-story/) is strong evidence for the existence of King David that is taken seriously by modern scholars.
1.2.4.1.1.1.2. Con: King David’s palace is the best explanation for the discovery of the [Large Stone Structure](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-sites-places/jerusalem/did-i-find-king-davids-palace/) discovered by Eilat Mazar.
1.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: The biblical accounts of King Solomon and the empire he ruled have been [called into question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon#Historicity). Little archaeological evidence has been found for the power he is usually ascribed or [for the temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon%27s_Temple#Archaeology) in Jerusalem named after him.
1.2.4.1.1.3. Pro: The historical evidence for the [Kingdom of Judah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Judah#Archaeological_record) and the [Kingdom of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_\(united_monarchy\)#Archaeological_record) is sparse and disputed; both were likely much smaller, less unified and less powerful than depicted in biblical accounts.
1.2.4.1.1.4. Con: While aspects of the story by which the Jewish people trace their ancient claim to sovereignty in Israel and Palestine are questionable, others are not. For example, the historical and archeological evidence of the [Hasmonean Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasmonean_dynasty) which ruled that area just prior to its incorporation into the Roman empire, is clear.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: Even if Palestinians understood their identity \(and by extension their nationality\) as part of a larger whole, this doesn't speak against their right to self-determination, which is at the basis of any claim to sovereignty. Thus, it is misleading to imply that there is no claim to Palestinian sovereignty over territory that Palestinians have occupied for centuries.
1.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.
1.2.4.3. Con: The Israeli claims are based on periods of Jewish sovereignty almost 2000 years ago. This is hardly a convincing standard for present-day claims.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: By the same logic, the Egyptian people have an exclusive claim to much of the territory as they had incorporated it [into their empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kingdom_of_Egypt) by the 15th century BC already.
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: There is little reason to assume that first occupancy is more relevant for judging contemporary claims than the duration of occupancy. The Jews ruled over the territory in question for less than 250 years. Arabs have a history of living there for more than 1000 years.
1.2.4.3.3. Pro: Indeed, all else being equal, present-day claims should weight more recent periods of sovereignty over more ancient ones, since they relate more proximally to the present day world.
1.2.4.3.3.1. Con: The other way round, one could also justify Israel's rule over the territories it acquired over the course of the past decades from the Palestinians as its claims are more proximally to the present day.
1.2.4.4. Con: Even [during the period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Palestine#Independent_Canaanite.2C_Israelite_and_Philistine_period) with an Israelite presence in the region, other independent peoples were present. Thus, they should also have a claim to the land. Among them are the Philistines who [fought Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philistines) according to the Bible.
1.2.5. Con: Only 14% of Israelis regard the claim to a 'Greater Israel' as a priority \([Joint Palestinian-EU poll, p. 14](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)\).
1.2.5.1. Con: Today, organisations close to the old Movement for Greater Israel, such as the [Yesha Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesha_Council), have political influence.
1.2.6. Con: Palestinians have a strong moral claim to a Palestinian state given that they lived in the geographic area of Greater Palestine for centuries before leaving or [being expelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_exodus#Changes_in_the_Israeli_Representation_of_the_Causes_for_the_Exodus_.E2.80.93_Late_1970s) in response to the establishment of Israel.
1.2.6.1. Con: Before the [program of expulsion](http://www.meforum.org/263/why-jews-fled-the-arab-countries) from Arab countries, including Palestine, Jews were living in this territory too.
1.2.6.1.1. Con: The claim of the Jews is not incompatible with the claim of the Palestinians. The might both have legitimate claims and therefore both have states recognised.
1.2.6.2. Con: There was never a Palestinian state in history so they have no claim over the area.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: This should not matter if it is good for peace in the region.
1.2.6.2.1.1. Con: There is something to be said for this, but it's not good for peace in the region. When given land and self government, they elected terrorists and attacked Israel.
1.2.6.2.2. Con: Sovereign states as we know them today are relativily recent. There were almost no sovereign state in africa before the 1950s-1960s, it doesn't mean there were no people living there.
1.2.6.3. Con: [Israel's Proclamation of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence), issued May 14, 1948, invited the Palestinians to remain in their homes and become equal citizens in the new state.
1.2.6.4. Con: Several [binding instruments](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/palmanda.asp) of international law grant sovereign rights to the Jewish people in the land of Israel. Zero binding instruments of international law support the claims of the Palestinian Arabs.
1.2.6.5. Con: There may be a claim but it is neither strong nor moral. As history attests, Jews were the original inhabitants- [dispossessed and exiled by the Romans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Roman_Empire#Dispersion_of_the_Jews_in_the_Roman_Empire) in the 1st century and the land then invaded and occupied by several succeeding empires. [Arabs invaded in the 7th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_the_Levant#Conquest_of_Palestine). The claim of the Palestinian Arabs is based on the principle that the descendants of invaders and occupiers have a greater right to inherit property than the descendents of the original owners.
1.2.7. Con: Under the plan proposed here, Jews would retain access to their most important religious sites, such as the Temple Mount and the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. A two-state solution can thus accommodate the religious claims of Jews.
1.2.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.4.
1.2.8. Con: Religious claims played very [little](https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/bookauth/zionism/gwint.htm) role in the early history of the Zionist movement in Palestine and in the creation of the state of Israel, during which time Zionism was aggressively secular. Rather, the chief argument for sovereignty was the need to have a Jewish majority nation-state in order to enforce the rights of Jewish people.
1.2.9. Con: If ancient claims to land are valid, the rightful rulers of nearly all nations would need to change.
1.2.9.1. Con: Even if true on paper, this would not matter in practice as there is no dispute over the rightful rulers of most swathes of land. The slippery slope hinted at by the parent is therefore not of practical relevance for recognizing Jewish land claims.
1.2.10. Con: The United States is a secular democracy and should not take religious claims into consideration when deciding a matter of foreign policy.
1.2.10.1. Con: When making a decision that has an impact on a highly religious area of the world, it would be foolish to ignore religion entirely.
1.2.11. Con: The Jews are not the first settlers, nor the founders, nor the people who inhabited that land for the longest period. If ancient claims are to be considered, then the descendants of the Canaanites - the native Levantines - Palestinians, Lebanese, Syrians, as proven by genetic studies [\(1\)](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/10/081030-phoenician-dna-genographic-missions.html)[\(2\)](https://anthropology.net/2008/10/30/the-y-chromosomal-footprint-of-phoenicians-throughout-the-mediterranean/)[\(3\)](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/ancient-dna-reveals-fate-mysterious-canaanites), would be the real first settlers and founders of Jerusalem and other cities, and should own that land. If religious claims are to be considered, then we should consider Muslim claims too.
1.2.11.1. Pro: All this about moving the Embassy is nothing but political pandering to dispensational evangelicals that believe political Israel are God's chosen.
1.2.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.2.12. Con: Religious claims can't determine the "rightful rulers" of a land. The Amerindian people have a [strong religion](http://nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/315) and [worship specific places](http://indianrockpiles.weetu.com/articles/IndianRockPiles.html) on the Land of the United States of America and Canada, yet [they are not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr2CljnycW4) its rulers. A similar situation exists in many other countries and regions.
1.2.13. Con: The Zionist movement was predominately European Jewish. The original Jews that were expelled and wish to return to the area did return and then [converted to islam](https://mondediplo.com/2008/09/07israel) - they are modern day Palestinians.
1.2.13.1. Con: Sand's thesis rests on a number of claims, one of which is the idea of Khazar myth. It has been [refuted \(part 5, conclusions\)](http://www.khazaria.com/khazar-diaspora.html) and [debunked](https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/khazar-myth-busted-1.5253397) a number of times.
1.2.13.1.1. Pro: A number of [comments](http://yaacovlozowick.blogspot.com/2010/09/scholars-on-shlomo-sand.html?showComment=1285184760358#c555239050575930416), [articles](http://jewlicious.com/2009/11/shlomo-sand-ridiculed-by-historian-simon-schama/) [and](http://jewlicious.com/2009/03/the-french-love-a-good-anti-zionist-socialist-book/) [reviews](http://jewlicious.com/2009/03/french-love-a-good-anti-zionist-book-cont/) have attacked his [methods](https://newrepublic.com/article/72363/indecent-proposal) and [conclusions](http://zioncon.blogspot.com/2008/08/tel-aviv-universitys-shlomo-sand-and.html) \(though some articles are behind [paywalls](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13531040902752531?journalCode=fjih20)\).
1.2.14. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.3. Pro: Public opinion in the US supports this step: [more Americans](http://www.gallup.com/poll/189626/americans-views-toward-israel-remain-firmly-positive.aspx) support an independent Palestinian state than oppose it.
1.3.1. Con: At the same time, [two thirds of Americans](http://www.gallup.com/poll/189626/americans-views-toward-israel-remain-firmly-positive.aspx) sympathize more with Israel than with Palestinians in the current situation; only 15% think the other way around. This makes the recognition of Palestine against Israel's explicit preference hard to sell.
1.3.1.1. Pro: The public's attitude towards Israel gives American politicians little incentive to support positions that run counter to Israeli interests. In fact, support for Israel has been labeled as "cheap talk" - it gives politicians large benefits with minimal risk \([Cavari/Nyer, p. 20](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.2979/israelstudies.19.3.1.pdf)\).
1.3.1.2. Pro: The [vast majority](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/05/23/5-facts-about-how-americans-view-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/) of Republican voters sympathize more with Israel than with Palestine and do not consider a peaceful two-state solution viable. Politicians in Republican-dominated US politics have little to gain from defying this.
1.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.2.
1.3.1.4. Con: Sympathising with Israel is not mutually exclusive to establishing a Palestinian state. The American public can blame Hamas for its aggressive actions but still believe that the Palestinian people deserve a state.
1.3.1.5. Pro: In the same vein, only a very small minority [of 6%](https://www.brookings.edu/research/american-attitudes-on-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/) would like to see the Trump government lean towards the Palestinian side in this conflict.
1.3.1.5.1. Con: This is only because the majority of voters want the Trump administration to lean towards [neither side](https://www.brookings.edu/research/american-attitudes-on-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/), so this does not indicate a general attitude of support for Israel.
1.3.1.6. Pro: Almost half of all Americans - and a majority of Republican voters - believe that the Jewish people are God's chosen people. This makes policies perceived as going against Israeli interests hard to sell \([Brookings, p. 9](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2015-Poll-Key-Findings-Final-1.pdf)\).
1.3.2. Con: While this is currently the case, support for Israel is increasing and support for a Palestinian state is decreasing over time; given that the current margin in favour of a Palestinian state is small, it is likely to disappear in the future. \([Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/189626/americans-views-toward-israel-remain-firmly-positive.aspx)\)
1.3.2.1. Con: Policies are not based upon expected future voter preferences, but current actual voter preferences. Given that, the US should recognise Palestine as a state since a majority of the population supports it.
1.3.3. Con: The relevance and trustworthiness of American public opinion is questionable in light of how uninformed Americans generally are about foreign policy issues.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Only a third of Americans have ever heard of USAid, their country's own organization for international development. Even among college graduates this number increases to only 54% \([Milner/Tingley, p. 392](https://scholar.harvard.edu/dtingley/publications/public-opinion-and-foreign-aid-review-essay)\).
1.3.3.2. Pro: According to [polls](http://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/poll-finding/data-note-americans-views-on-the-u-s-role-in-global-health/), only one in twenty Americans knows that the United States spends about 1% of its GDP on foreign aid. The average estimate of the number is 26%.
1.3.3.3. Pro: Studies from the 1990s indicate that Americans are [less informed](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1081180X96001002003) about foreign policy issues and world affairs than citizens of major European countries and Canada.
1.3.3.4. Pro: Many Americans lack basic geographic knowledge about the world and especially the Middle East. In a 2016 survey of American university and college students, seven out of ten couldn't locate Israel on a map; only half were able to pinpoint countries of major relevance for US foreign policy like Iraq and Iran \([CFR, p. 23](https://www.cfr.org/content/newsletter/files/CFR_NatGeo_ASurveyonGlobalLiteracy.pdf)\).
1.3.3.4.1. Pro: These numbers are persistent and represent not only students. As of 2006, three out of four Americans couldn't locate Israel or Iran on a map of the region. Two thirds couldn't find major theaters of US engagement like Iraq or major allies like Saudi Arabia \([Roper, p. 25](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/roper2006/pdf/FINALReport2006GeogLitsurvey.pdf)\).
1.3.4. Pro: [Two thirds](https://www.brookings.edu/research/american-attitudes-on-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/) of all Americans - and even almost half of all Republican voters - believe America should either support or at least not block a UN resolution that recognizes Palestine as a state.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Given the US's history of voting on the UN Security Council \(it has vetoed nearly every resolution unfavorable to Israel\), even an abstention would be a de facto endorsement of the resolution.
1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.
1.5. Pro: Recognition of a Palestinian state is an important step in ending Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.
1.5.1. Pro: If Palestine is recognised as a state, [Israeli settlements](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-38888649) will be tantamount to violating the sovereignty of this newly formed state. This makes them less tenable, and likely to stop.
1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.4.4.1.
1.5.1.2. Con: Israeli settlements do not stop expanding despite still being [illegal](https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12657.doc.htm). This will not be seen as a significant difference from the status quo.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Israel recently [authorised](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/israel-authorises-3000-settler-homes-west-bank-170201051854191.html) 3,000 more settler homes in the West Bank. These will likely continue unless the Palestinian state is established.
1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.
1.5.3. Pro: The US is one of the world's most influential actors. A US recognition of Palestine could be a powerful way of inspiring other nations to push harder for an independent Palestinian state.
1.5.3.1. Pro: By being the first big western country to [recognize](http://www.theperspective.se/?p=882) Palestine, Sweden led the way for a number of other Western European countries, including France, the United Kingdom and Spain, to do the same. US recognition would have even more effect, given its international status.
1.5.3.2. Con: The United States is too late to the boat to serve as an example to other nations, given that [70.5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_State_of_Palestine) of nations already recognize Palestine.
1.5.4. Pro: The only way for the Palestinian people to escape their oppression is for them to achieve a semblance of political parity with Israel, which will only be achieved through  international recognition.
1.5.5. Con: An end of Israel's occupation won't lead to any progress in the region as the Palestinian refusal to accept Israel's right to exist will continue to impede it.
1.5.6. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.
1.5.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.1.2.1.
1.5.8. Con: -> See 1.1.1.5.
1.5.9. Pro: Recognizing Palestine would improve the work of the UN on the ground in the Palestinian territories.
1.5.9.1. Pro: Currently, UN organisations who work with Palestine can be penalised, as [UNESCO](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/08/us-unesco-voting-funds-palestine-decision) was when the US withheld 22% of its budget when it admitted Palestine. This would no longer be the case if the US itself recognised Palestine.
1.5.9.1.1. Con: A US recognition would not improve the work of UNESCO experts that are not allowed to travel to sites in [Jerusalem](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/10/18/unesco-expected-adopt-controversial-jerusalem-resolution/92346718/) by Israel.
1.5.9.2. Con: Even without membership in specific UN organizations, these can do work in Palestine. UNIDO, for example, runs several projects on [food safety](http://gtad.wto.org/trta_subcategory.aspx?cat=3311301) or for the [Marble stone](https://www.unido.org/fileadmin/user_media_upgrade/Resources/Evaluation/Palestine_TVET_Evaluation_Final_Report__.pdf) industry.
1.5.10. Pro: The UN Fact Finding Mission in Gaza found that "some of the actions of the Government of Israel might justify a competent court finding that crimes against humanity have been committed," for example the [naval blockade](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/10/20111030172356990380.html). \([UN, p. 284](http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf)\). If Palestine were to be established as a sovereign state, these crimes would receive more attention and condemnation from the international community.
1.5.10.1. Con: The blockade is necessary to prevent Hamas from growing stronger.
1.5.10.1.1. Pro: Hamas uses the [majority of the supplies](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-s-quot-blockade-quot-of-gaza) brought into Gaza, so they never reach civilians anyways.
1.5.10.1.2. Pro: The US has [imposed sanctions](http://www.haaretz.com/news/u-s-imposes-sanctions-on-gaza-institutions-over-hamas-links-1.264983) on Gazan institutions because it realises the link between Hamas and the region.
1.5.10.2. Con: An earlier report by the UN, the [Palmer Report](https://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/middle_east/Gaza_Flotilla_Panel_Report.pdf) \(p. 44\), declared the naval blockade on Gaza legal.
1.5.10.2.1. Con: The Palmer Report was intended to [mend relations](https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/09/02/u-n-s-gaza-flotilla-report-adrift-at-sea/) between Turkey and Israel rather than provide a factual assessment of the situation. Not only was the report more political than factual in nature, it also relied exclusively on information provided by Turkey and Israel, hence its conclusions cannot be considered definitive in either fact or law.
1.5.10.3. Pro: The Gaza blockade is very harmful for the Palestinians living in Gaza, and should be lifted.
1.5.10.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.6.1.2.
1.5.10.3.2. Pro: The four-year blockade deprives 1.6 million Palestinians living in the enclave of fundamental human rights.
1.5.10.3.2.1. Pro: About one-third of Gaza's arable land and 85 percent of its fishing waters are totally or partially inaccessible due to [Israeli military measures](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-gaza-rights-idUSTRE78C59R20110913). As a result, at least two-thirds of Gazan households lack secure access to food.
1.5.10.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.1.7.
1.5.10.3.2.3. Con: The United Nations Relief and Work Agency \(UNRWA\) [suspended](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/07/content_10776872.htm) its humanitarian activities in response to Hamas security forces seizing its aids. The blockade does not deprive Palestinians of important resources, but rather Hamas does.
1.5.10.3.2.3.1. Con: Hamas and Israel can both be responsible for depriving Palestinians of important resources. Just because Hamas steals some resources does not mean Israel does not harm Palestinians as well.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.
1.7. Con: The diplomatic recognition of Palestine alone will do little to help resolve the long-running conflict between Israel and Palestine.
1.7.1. Con: There would be a higher chance that Israel would be held accountable for any unfair practices. Much would change.
1.7.2. Con: The recognition of Palestine as a state will not resolve the conflict but it might help. The US should do anything which might help resolve the conflict.
1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.6.1.5.
1.7.4. Pro: The intractability of the conflict between Palestinians and Israel [has](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0162-895X.00255/full) [been](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-4560.2007.00518.x/abstract) [linked](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-2409.2010.01018.x/abstract) to underlying emotions and collective emotional orientations that fuel thinking and beliefs which make any progress next to impossible.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Emotional orientations can strengthen existing beliefs and even function as internally-generated evidence in support of these beliefs. The resulting beliefs and dispositions can thus be largely immune to logical arguments \([Mercer, p. 7](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/40607979.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A9d7e89b17ec5614b927244689024ed89)\).
1.7.5. Pro: In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza, removing all its settlements. Instead of rebuilding Gaza, the territory was turned into a terrorist base for Hamas which began firing rockets into Israel and sending suicide bombers into Israel resulting in deaths of Israeli civilians. Assuming recognition will lead to withdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian territories, the same may happen again.
1.7.6. Pro: As the Palestinian leadership \(both [Hamas](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-assures-critics-israels-destruction-still-a-goal/) and [Fatah](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-assures-critics-israels-destruction-still-a-goal/)\) has been clear that an independent Palestine will not end the conflict, recognition of Palestine would simply reward Palestinian intransigence.
1.7.7. Con: Deciding whether or not a given population deserves independence as a basic human right should not depend upon a desired political outcome.
1.7.7.1. Pro: Palestine is a legitimate state and deserves to be recognised as such.
1.7.7.1.1. Con: Palestine is not a sovereign state in accordance with the [traditional concept of Statehood](http://www.politicalsciencenotes.com/essay/sovereignty-meaning-and-characteristics-of-sovereignty/254).
1.7.7.1.1.1. Pro: Palestine [does not have contiguous borders](http://america.aljazeera.com/multimedia/2014/7/west-bank-security.html), but is instead made up of an archipelago of areas of control, broken up by Israeli settlements and highways.
1.7.7.1.1.1.1. Con: It is unclear why the nature of a state's borders bears on its legitimacy, particularly in a modern context in which physical travel is less important.
1.7.7.1.1.1.2. Con: Other countries, too, have split territories and exclaves. French Guiana is part of France, Alaska part of the United States and Kaliningrad Oblast part of Russia, even though none of them share a border with their country's main territory.
1.7.7.1.1.1.3. Con: It is circular to deny Palestine the recognition of a state, which would presumably consolidate its territory, because its territory is not consolidated at the moment.
1.7.7.1.1.2. Con: The legal definition of a state, as enshrined in international law, is outlined in the [Montevideo Convention of Statehood](https://www.ilsa.org/jessup/jessup15/Montevideo%20Convention.pdf). Palestine fulfils this criteria .
1.7.7.1.1.2.1. Pro: Palestine has the "capacity to enter into relations with the other states" as it has a web of [diplomatic representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_of_Palestine) around the world.
1.7.7.1.1.2.2. Pro: Palestine clearly fulfills the [territory](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Palestine/\@31.9198698,34.6425902,9z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x151cf2d28866bdd9:0xee17a001d166f686!8m2!3d31.952162!4d35.233154) criteria as it rests upon a strip on the West Bank and in Gaza.
1.7.7.1.1.2.3. Pro: Palestine has a permanent population of around [4.7 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Palestinian_territories). Therefore Palestine fulfils criteria 1\(a\) of the Montevideo Convention.
1.7.7.1.1.2.4. Con: Palestine lacks a single sovereign government which can enforce laws throughout its dominion.
1.7.7.1.1.2.4.1. Con: Official recognition of statehood by the US could facilitate processes to unify control of Palestine; the granting of statehood could be made contingent on this happening.
1.7.7.1.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Fatah and Hamas have [already indicated](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.765719) a willingness to form a unity government. US recognition could enable greater international cooperation in the formation of that government.
1.7.7.1.1.2.4.2. Con: Even though Abbas's government does not have control over the entire territory, it is already the only sovereign recognized by most world governments, including the United Nations, whose [representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Ambassador_to_the_United_Nations) is appointed by Abbas. In this respect, it is no different than any other state that does not fully control its territory.
1.7.7.1.1.2.4.3. Con: [Pakistan](http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/08/26/militancy-in-pakistan/), [Nigeria](http://studies.aljazeera.net/en/reports/2016/06/resurgence-militancy-nigerias-oil-rich-niger-delta-dangers-militarisation-160608065729726.html), [India](http://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/islamic-militancy-in-india-1478730250.html), [Ukraine](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2017/02/ukraine-map-170205081953296.html), and [Phillippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_the_Philippines) are just a few of the many states in the world that have militant organisations carrying out violent atrocities within their borders, yet they are all recognised as states.
1.7.7.1.1.2.4.3.1. Con: As it is more difficult to revoke recognition than to initially grant it, the examples are different from Palestine.
1.7.7.1.1.2.4.4. Pro: Palestine is [politically divided](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2015/09/21/hamas-or-the-palestinian-authority-who-will-fail-first/) between two factions: Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, and Fatah which controls the West Bank.
1.7.7.1.1.2.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.5.
1.7.7.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.1.1.2.4.
1.7.7.1.1.4. Pro: Palestine does not have a [monopoly on violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence) over the area it claims.
1.7.7.1.1.4.1. Pro: Israeli forces [regularly conduct raids](http://english.wafa.ps/page.aspx?id=6kwWfka60076552866a6kwWfk) into Palestinian areas of the West Bank to arrest suspected terrorists.
1.7.7.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Israeli intrusion should not render a state illegitimate: the US frequently intervenes militarily in countries without their consent, but that does not make their governments illegitimate.
1.7.7.1.1.4.1.2. Con: The frequency of these raids would presumably diminish drastically if this recognition strengthened the ability of the Palestinian state to maintain control itself.
1.7.7.1.1.4.2. Con: Recognition of statehood from the US could increase the ability of Palestinian governments to exert power within their borders and establish a monopoly on violence.
1.7.7.1.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.7.7.1.1.2.4.3.
1.7.7.1.1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.1.1.
1.7.7.1.2. Con: Palestinians have a [right to a nationality](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Pages/Nationality.aspx) \(to be citizens of a country\), however this does not imply a UN right to have a state of their own. Their rights to security and a stable life could equally be satisfied by giving them citizenship in another country \(for example Israel or Jordan\).
1.7.7.1.2.1. Pro: [Millions of Palestinians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians_in_Jordan) already have, or are eligible to apply for, Jordanian citizenship. This indicates that Palestinians can be provided with citizenship in either Jordan, or other states.
1.7.7.1.2.1.1. Con: Jordan has recently been [arbitrarily withdrawing citizenship](https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/02/01/stateless-again/palestinian-origin-jordanians-deprived-their-nationality) from people of Palestinian origin.
1.7.7.1.2.1.2. Con: Jordan has [no](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4615/jordan-palestinians) interest in accepting Palestinians as its own citizens, not least because it fears being transformed into a Palestinian state. It currently refuses entry to, or forcibly deports, Palestinian refugees.
1.7.7.1.2.2. Pro: The Rohingya are a stateless group within Myanmar, however, the [UN calls for Myanmar to give them citizenship](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2014/12/un-calls-full-rohingya-citizenship-myanmar-monks-rakhin-2014123044246726211.html), and rejects giving them a state of their own, despite [some Rohingya groups](http://cartogracy.com/conflict/rohingya) fighting for independence.
1.7.7.1.2.2.1. Con: This approach has not been particularly effective in protecting the Rohingya, who many observers believe face [genocide](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/rohingya-muslims-burma-government-rapes-massacres-government-genocide-ethnic-cleansing-rakhine-a7471636.html). There is no reason to believe it would be any more effective in helping the Palestinians either.
1.7.7.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.7.7.1.2.1.2.
1.7.7.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.5.5.
1.7.7.1.2.5. Pro: Many Palestinians are [eligible for Israeli citizenship](http://www.timesofisrael.com/more-east-jerusalem-palestinians-seek-israeli-citizenship/), yet they remain stateless for ideological reasons.
1.7.7.1.2.5.1. Con: This applies [only](http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/14/opinion/la-oe-myers-israel-citizenship-arabs-20140114) to Palestinians living in East Jerusalem, not the millions living in the rest of the occupied territories.
1.7.7.1.2.5.2. Con: Offering Palestinians Israeli citizenship as their only option coerces them into accepting citizenship in a nation that has repeatedly committed atrocities against their people. This is reprehensible.
1.7.7.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.7.7.1.4. Pro: Palestinians have a right to self-determination because they lived on the land in question for a longer period of time than the Israelis.
1.7.7.1.4.1. Con: It was not the fact of owning land, but the [British Mandate for Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine_\(legal_instrument\)#Establishment_of_a_national_home_for_the_Jewish_people) that established the mechanism for Israeli statehood.
1.7.7.1.4.1.1. Con: The British Mandate for Palestine was a piece of legislation produced by a colonial organisation, the League of Nations, with little regard for the rights of Palestinian Arabs. It should not be considered a legitimate cession of Palestinian moral ownership of the area.
1.7.7.1.4.1.1.1. Con: There was no sovereign entity in history named Palestine until the Mandate for Palestine. Indeed the Arabs who inhabited the land at the time saw themselves as Arabs or Syrians. The mandate was a legally binding instrument created by the League of Nations and backed by the San Remo declaration and the treaty of Sevres \(1920\) whereby the previous sovereign- Ottoman Turkey- divested itself of any claims to the area. The mandate recognised the rights of Jews to reconstitute their national home.
1.7.7.1.4.2. Pro: Expulsions and the illegal occupation of land that had been temporarily vacated during the war of 1948, called [the Palestinian Exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_exodus), shaped the land claim of the early Israeli state.
1.7.7.1.4.3. Pro: Because Palestinians were forcibly expelled from Israel, their claim to sovereignty over the area was never legitimately extinguished, so they still enjoy a right to sovereign control over parts of the Israel/Palestine area.
1.7.7.1.4.3.1. Con: Palestinians never had a claim to sovereignty over the area in the first place; [Britain did](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine), as Palestine prior to 1948 was part of the British Mandate.
1.7.7.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.
1.7.7.1.4.5. Pro: Palestinians inhabited an even greater area than now but much of their land was [stolen](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_gist/1997/05/selling_land_to_jews.html) by Israel.
1.7.7.1.4.5.1. Con: While individual Palestinians may have claims to land because it was stolen from them, this doesn't establish the legitimacy of a Palestinian state that postdates this theft.
1.7.7.1.4.5.1.1. Con: All Palestinians have suffered from the flow-on consequences of the initial theft of land; they therefore all have a moral claim to the land.
1.7.7.1.4.5.1.2. Con: At the very least, by indicating that the Israeli claim to the land is based on theft and therefore not legitimate, it strengthens the Palestinian claim to the land and therefore to self-determination.
1.7.7.1.4.5.1.3. Con: If modern Israel's legitimacy postdates its historical-right narrative, which is over 2,000 years old, then the 100 year-old right of Palestinians is also valid.
1.7.7.1.4.5.2. Con: This ignores the fact that Jews in British mandated Palestine existed and can be considered 'Israeli', and that a vast amount of modern day Israel was [legally purchased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine) off Arab inhabitants. The land wasn't considered 'stolen' when it was under Jordanian control and Egyptian control.
1.7.7.1.4.5.2.1. Con: As of 1945, only around 7% of Historic Palestine was Jewish-owned. It is hard to imagine how the remainder - almost 19.000 square km - could have been legally purchased off Arab inhabitants.
1.7.7.1.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: In 1945, organizations such as the JNF and PICA owned [906.80 sq km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine#Land_purchases), which was half the Jewish-owned land in the region. Twice that - all the land in Jewish hands - made up merely 7% of the the combined area of [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Israel), the [West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank) and [Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip).
1.7.7.1.4.5.3. Con: The land could not be stolen by a state that did not yet exist. If the land was stolen then it was stolen by someone else \(e.g. the British\).
1.7.7.1.5. Pro: The decision to recognize or not recognize the legitimacy of the Palestinian state is an important way in which other states signal their stance on the Israel/Palestine conflict, irrespective of any theoretical set of criteria for statehood. Acknowledging its legitimacy is thus a way of acknowledging the legitimacy of the Palestinian side of the conflict.
1.7.7.1.6. Pro: Recognition by many other nations is a sufficient condition for a state to be legitimate.
1.7.7.1.6.1. Pro: Political legitimacy is a social construct, and the political legitimacy of a state's existence depends solely on the number of other states willing to recognise that state's existence.
1.7.7.1.6.2. Pro: Many other states have recognised, or indicated their willingness to recognise, an independent Palestinian state.
1.7.7.1.6.2.1. Pro: Palestine has [more states recognising it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_limited_recognition) than any other partially-recognised state not recognised by the US.
1.7.7.1.6.2.2. Con: Several other polities are partially recognised, however the US has not historically seen this as a compelling reason to recognise them itself.
1.7.7.1.6.2.2.1. Pro: 84 UN states [recognise the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic) \(Western Sahara\), however the US does not.
1.7.7.1.6.2.2.2. Pro: The Republic of China \(Taiwan\) is [recognised by 19 UN member states as well as the Vatican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Taiwan#Entities_with_full_diplomatic_relations_with_Taiwan), but not by the US.
1.7.7.1.6.2.2.3. Con: Many other non- or partially-recognized polities are of little relevance for the United States. But in the case of Palestine, and as pointed out elsewhere in this debate, recognition would come with numerous benefits for America and its interests.
1.7.7.1.6.2.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.
1.7.7.1.6.2.3. Pro: The European Union has consistently declared its support and readiness for recognising a Palestinian state. This is outlined in both the [1980 Venice Declaration](http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/mepp/docs/venice_declaration_1980_en.pdf) and [Berlin Declaration of March 1999](http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp418.htm).
1.7.7.1.6.2.3.1. Con: This rhetorical commitment is not particularly significant. More than half of the EU's members and its five largest countries do not recognize Palestine as a state - a step they could easily take without incurring any significant cost.
1.7.7.1.6.2.3.2. Pro: The EU has [invested significantly](http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_five_reasons_to_recognise_a_palestinian_state360) in the two-state solution, with almost €2.5 billion given by EU member states in support of Palestinian state building efforts since 2007. This is in addition to an annual contribution of over €200 million towards UNRWA, the Relief Work Agency that carries out work in the occupied territories.
1.7.7.1.6.2.4. Pro: 135 members of the UN [recognise](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/11/07/map-the-countries-that-recognize-palestine-as-a-state/?utm_term=.75a6e0dbe01e) Palestine as a state. Palestine was therefore recognised by a [higher percentage of nations](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dashanne-stokes/is-this-the-real-reason-why-us-wont-recognize-palestine_b_9777246.html) at the time of its failed application to the U.N. in 2011 \(68 percent\) than Israel was \(64 percent\) when it was successfully admitted in 1949.
1.7.7.1.6.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.1.2.
1.7.7.1.7. Pro: The conquest of Palestinian territories by Israel in the [Six-Day War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War) was illegitimate.
1.7.7.1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.11.
1.7.7.1.7.2. Con: As the land taken in the defensive war did not belong to any entity called "Palestine" framing the claim as a "conquest of Palestinian territories" is fallacious. The area in question had been held by Jordan.
1.7.7.1.8. Con: The current nonexistence of a Palestinian state is [due to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Palestine) the rejection of a partition plan by Arab leaders in 1948 and subsequent acts of warfare against the new state of Israel by Arab nations. Given that Palestinians voluntarily forfeited their opportunity to receive a state, they are not entitled to one now.
1.7.7.1.8.1. Con: The actions of historical leaders from other nations are irrelevant when it comes to considering the rights of modern-day Palestinians.
1.7.7.1.8.1.1. Con: If the actions of historical leaders from other nations are irrelevant, then the actions of current leaders from other nations are irrelevant. The passage of time wouldn’t do anything to make leaders from other nations more relevant. Therefore, the United States and other nations shouldn’t get involved in the rights of modern-day Palestinians.
1.7.7.1.8.2. Con: The U.N. partition [recommendation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine) called for more than half of then Palestinian land to be allocated for a “Jewish State”. This was unreasonable as the Arabs were a majority in Palestine at the time, and owned more land than Jews in every single district in the region. The 1948 plan was unfair and deserved to be rejected.
1.7.7.1.8.2.1. Con: Even if the agreement was unfair, the violent reaction against Israel from surrounding Arab nations was unjustified.
1.7.7.1.8.2.1.1. Con: We would not say, "Even if the occupation of Poland was unfair the violent reaction against Germany was unjustified."
1.7.7.1.8.3. Pro: The actions of historical and modern leaders from other nations are relevant when it comes to considering the rights of modern day Palestinians.
1.7.7.1.8.4. Pro: Palestine as a country never existed until the mid to late 20th Century. Palestine is a region of the Middle East that Israel, parts of modern day Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon exist in.
1.7.7.1.8.4.1. Pro: Arab leaders in 1919 denied that there is an entity called Palestine. To make claims about any native or pre-existing Palestinian identity therefore does not make sense and flies in the face of historical claims made by the Arabs themselves \([Bard, p. 3](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/mf2017.pdf#page=10)\).
1.7.7.1.9. Pro: The people of Palestine have the right to self-determination. Recognizing their state would also recognize this right.
1.7.7.1.9.1. Pro: The Palestinian people have the right to self-determination on the basis of how long they have lived on the land.
1.7.7.1.9.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
1.7.7.1.9.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.7.7.1.9.1.3. Con: This is an arbitrary way of deciding which people have a right to the land, as there is no set period after which these rights come into being.
1.7.7.1.9.2. Pro: The Palestinians have a [right to self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination) and to chose their political status on the basis that they are a people.
1.7.7.1.9.2.1. Con: Even if the Palestinians are recognized as a people, the way they want to self-determine can hardly be gauged due to the lack of a unitary government.
1.7.7.1.9.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.1.1.2.4.4.
1.7.7.1.9.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.5.4.2.
1.7.7.1.9.2.2. Con: It is [not clear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination#Defining_"peoples") how to define "peoples" and whether the Palestinians therefore have the right to self-determination.
1.7.7.1.9.2.2.1. Pro: In numerous cases the applicability of the right to self-determination is disputed, for example in the case of the [Kurdish people](http://opiniojuris.org/2017/09/28/kurds-right-self-determination-andor-secession/) and the [Basque people](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-basque-self-determination/spains-basque-country-proclaims-right-to-self-determination-idUSKBN0E91R720140529).
1.7.7.1.9.2.3. Con: No, they don't. They are Arabs, mostly Jordanian or Syrian, not any distinct people. They have no distinct history or culture. They never had their own nation at any time in history. The name Palestinian was pushed in the 1960's for the express purpose of sounding like one and arguing for a country.
1.7.7.1.9.2.3.1. Con: It shouldn't matter how far the history of a people goes back. The Palestinians of today have a distinct history and culture, for example on their basis for recognition and self-determination.
1.7.7.1.9.2.3.2. Con: By the same logic, the people of Israel should not have the right to self-determination and a state of their own. Israel was founded in 1948, after all.
1.7.7.1.9.3. Con: If the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination clashes with the same right of the Jewish people, it is not clear how both can be respected.
1.7.7.1.9.4. Con: The right to self-determination is [not a tangible element](http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e873) of international law and has no clear content or obligations; it is rather a vague moral principle recognized by various bodies.
1.7.7.1.9.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.1.9.2.2.
1.7.7.1.9.4.2. Pro: Even where there is agreement on the existence of a people, it is [not clear](http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e873) what the right to self-determination entails and how precisely it can be exercised.
1.7.7.1.9.5. Pro: In 1988, Jordanian kingdom made an unconstitutional agreement with Israel regarding CisJordanian people who lost their nationality and Israel never considered them as Israeli people. Stateless, they chose to become Palestinians, as a nationality. These people exist. Therefore, Palestine is their State.

1.7.7.1.10. Con: -> See 1.1.1.5.
1.8. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.1.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.
1.11. Con: Part of Palestine, the Gaza Strip, is ruled by [Hamas](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/world/middleeast/palestinians-gaza-cabinet-hamas.html), a group that the US recognises as a radical Islamist terrorist group. Recognising a Palestine that is partially ruled by Hamas is equivalent to legitimising a terrorist organisation.
1.11.1. Con: Hezbollah [exerts massive amounts of control](http://www.newsweek.com/hezbollahs-latest-conquest-lebanons-cabinet-541487) over Lebanon, however, the US still recognizes Lebanon's statehood.
1.11.1.1. Con: US recognition of Lebanon predates the creation of Hezbollah in [1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah).
1.11.1.2. Pro: Hezbollah is designated a [Foreign Terror Organisation](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm) by the US.
1.11.1.3. Con: Whereas Hamas controls the Gaza Strip, the influence of Hezbollah is smaller in day-to-day affairs. It holds [merely 9%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_general_election,_2017) of the seats in parliament, provides only [two out of 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_government_of_December_2016) ministers and neither the Prime Minister nor President.
1.11.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.5.6.4.1.
1.11.3. Pro: Hamas' latest [charter](http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hamas-charter-1637794876) calls for complete destruction of Israel therefore any conversation regarding recognition of Palestinian state is akin to supporting of another genocide against Jews and Israel.
1.11.3.1. Con: Hamas clearly states [in the charter](http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hamas-charter-1637794876) that it opposes a Jewish state but not the Jewish people because they are Jewish. This undermines the assumption that Hamas seeks a genocide beyond the destruction of Israel.
1.11.3.1.1. Con: 44% of the world's Jewish Population lives in Israel. If violence is used to remove Jews from the state in order to make it something other than a Jewish state, it is not unreasonable to think that this would constitute a Jewish genocide, regardless of the intent.
1.11.3.2. Pro: Hamas leaders have been outspoken about their objective of establishing a Palestinian state from the "[river to the sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas_Covenant)" as opposed to the Palestinian Authority's support for an agreement based on the 1967 lines. Hamas enjoys a fairly wide support from the Palestinian population.
1.11.3.3. Con: The "destruction of Israel" does not imply the killing of anyone. Hamas would surely be delighted with a peaceful end to the state of Israel.
1.11.3.3.1. Con: Israel will never willingly abolish itself as a state, which will necessitate [confrontation](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-gaza-palestine-protests-latest-hamas-west-bank-15-dead-ronen-manelis-violence-middle-east-a8282651.html), which will ultimately lead to deaths.
1.11.4. Pro: Political recognition helps Hamas to achieve its goal of imitating Hezbollah and its success as a recognized actor in national politics and the public discourse \([CRS, p. 33](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33566.pdf)\).
1.11.5. Con: Hamas is not entirely a terrorist organisation, it's mostly a political party. Only its armed branch, called [Izz ad Din al Qassam Brigades](https://web.archive.org/web/20110822125618/http://www.nationalsecurity.gov.au/agd/WWW/nationalsecurity.nsf/Page/What_Governments_are_doing_Listing_of_Terrorism_Organisations_Hamas%26apos), may be considered as a terrorist organisation.
1.11.6. Con: -> See 1.1.1.5.6.4.4.
1.11.7. Con: The United States recognizes states and interacts with governments which it has classified as [state sponsors of terrorism](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/list/c14151.htm): Syria, Iran and Libya.
1.11.7.1. Pro: The USA has also been involved in [state-sponsored terrorism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_state-sponsored_terrorism), regime change and war since its inception, yet that didn't lead other states to call into question American statehood. The same should be the case for Palestine.
1.11.7.2. Con: It wouldn’t benefit Palestine to be recognized as a [state sponsor of terrorism](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/list/c14151.htm) by the United States.
1.11.7.3. Pro: Not only would the designation of a state sponsor of terrorism probably be not particularly problematic, it is also unlikely. Even if organizations like Hamas are categorized as sponsors of terrorism, it is hard to imagine that this label would be applied to Palestine as a whole.
1.11.7.4. Con: This does not mean that America should accept the establishment of a new state that would de-facto be controlled \(if only in part\) by a terrorist group.
1.11.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.
1.11.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.6.2.
1.11.10. Con: It is possible to recognize Palestine as a state and simultaneously condemn Hamas as terrorists and illegitimate rulers of the area they control in Gaza.
1.11.10.1. Pro: Similar situations already occur in countries like Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Colombia, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Ukraine.
1.11.11. Con: Should the Palestinian government \(or parts of it\) become associated with terror acts, Palestine could simply be added to the list of state-sponsors of terrorism.
1.11.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.6.4.
1.11.13. Con: -> See 1.1.1.5.5.1.
1.12. Pro: Israel has all but given up on the two state solution. The US must take this step to bring Israel back to the negotiating table.
1.12.1. Con: Israeli public opinion indicates that Israel has not given up on the two-state solution.
1.12.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.
1.12.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.1.
1.12.1.3. Pro: Polls [indicate that](https://knessetjeremy.com/knessetjeremy-polling-average-the-israeli-poll-of-polls/) throughout the first half of 2017, Yesh Atid - which supports a two-state solution - has been either the most popular or second-most popular party among Israeli voters.
1.12.1.4. Con: At the same time, issues other than national security and relations with Palestinians dominate Israeli elections. During the 2015 parliamentary vote, [a majority of voters](http://www.timesofisrael.com/cost-of-living-tops-list-of-election-issues-poll/) saw economic issues as most pressing; only a quarter gave priority to security issues.
1.12.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.1.2.
1.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.7.2.
1.12.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.

1.12.6. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.
1.12.7. Con: Israel is so heavily invested in its settlements and businesses in the Occupied Territories that it would never agree to negotiate a two-state solution.
1.12.7.1. Pro: 42% of Israeli Jews consider settlements to be [beneficial](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2016-03-08/poll-plurality-of-israelis-think-settlements-help-security) towards Israel's security. Future governments will be constrained by the will of the public.
1.12.7.1.1. Con: There is a trend of [decreasing](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.599003) support among the Israeli public for the settlers. This will likely not be a constraining factor on future governments.
1.12.7.1.2. Con: The [economy](http://www.timesofisrael.com/for-43-of-likely-voters-economic-issues-not-the-palestinians-or-iran-are-top-priority/) is the most important issue for most Israeli voters, and given the [increasing cost](http://www.haaretz.com/settlements-have-cost-israel-17-billion-study-finds-1.265190) of settlements, it is unlikely that settlements will swing the vote in favour of continued occupation.
1.12.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.6.1.
1.12.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.3.3.
1.12.7.4. Pro: There are [406,000 Israeli settlers](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/213234) living in the West Bank, an increase of 29% since 2010. This is nearly 5% of Israel's population.
1.12.7.4.1. Pro: Ultra-orthodox Jews have [much higher birth rates](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/israel-has-the-highest-birth-rate-in-the-developed-world-and-thats-becoming-a-problem-2015-9?r=US&IR=T) than the general population. Given that [many settlers are ultra-orthodox](http://www.timesofisrael.com/a-look-at-israeli-settlers-by-the-numbers/), the number of Israelis in the Occupied Territories will continue increasing rapidly for the foreseeable future.
1.12.7.5. Con: Although withdrawing from settlements would be costly, remaining in the status quo is far costlier.
1.12.7.5.1. Pro: The status quo involves [continuous terrorist violence](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/terrorism/terrisraelsum.html).
1.12.7.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.13.2.
1.12.7.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.13.4.1.2.2.1.
1.12.7.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.3.1.2.
1.12.7.5.2. Pro: The status quo involves nearly complete [alienation from the international community](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.735598).
1.12.7.5.3. Pro: Construction and maintenance of these settlements has become [increasingly costly](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinian-israel-settlements-idUSKBN0EZ0JA20140624) - one study suggests that they cost up to [$17 billion by 2012](http://www.haaretz.com/settlements-have-cost-israel-17-billion-study-finds-1.265190). This has lead to increasing opposition to settlements within Israeli society.
1.12.8. Con: Palestinians list [preconditions](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/PA-Only-precondition-for-talks-is-that-Israel-announce-commitment-to-two-states-499991) to engage in peace talks. If a party needs to be brought back to the negotiation table, it is Palestine.
1.12.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.
1.12.10. Con: Recognitions of a Palestinian State prior to an agreement undermines existing agreements between the Palestinians and Israelis and makes a final status agreement that much more difficult.
1.12.11. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.13.3.
1.12.12. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.12.13. Con: Israel's unwillingness to engage in peace talks is due to [domestic political considerations](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/us-offered-israel-secret-peace-deal-in-2016-but-netanyahu-walked-away-a7588526.html), such as Netanyahu's desire to placate the far-right members of his coalition. A US declaration would only empower these small far-right parties and exacerbate the domestic barriers to negotiating a two-state solution.
1.12.13.1. Con: -> See 1.12.1.3.
1.12.13.2. Pro: -> See 1.12.7.1.
1.12.13.3. Con: If domestic politics in Israel make any concessions to Palestinians impossible, this step needs to be taken in order to force the Israeli establishment into coming to the negotiating table. Otherwise, Netanyahu will continue to ignore the peace process entirely.
1.12.13.4. Pro: This declaration would empower insular, far-right narratives about how [Israel is the only safe place for Jews](http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-to-french-jews-israel-is-your-home/) and that [the world hates Israel](http://www.newsweek.com/tel-aviv-diary-bibi-rails-against-world-536597). This would increase support for far-right parties, not encourage moderation or openness.
1.12.13.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.4.
1.12.14. Pro: After disillusionment with Israel's refusal to negotiate and arrive at a peace treaty, Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, sought to [bypass the peace process](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-08-19/palestine-goes-un) with Israel, showing that he believed it to be beyond recovery.
1.12.15. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.7.1.
1.12.16. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.7.3.
1.12.17. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.3.4.4.
1.12.18. Pro: This is important because without Israel recognizing a Palestinian state, little would change on the ground for Palestinian people.
1.13. Con: Palestinians refuse to recognise Israel specifically as a Jewish state; it is therefore hypocritical of them to demand that other actors recognise them as a legitimate state.
1.13.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.
1.13.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.1.
1.13.3. Pro: Recognition of Israel as a Jewish state is not the only hindrance to a two state solution - certain groups in power in Palestine do not even recognise Israel as a state. Hamas, which governs part of the current Palestinian territory, does [not explicitly recognize](http://hamas.ps/en/page/13/FAQ#FAQ5) Israel's legitimacy or even its right to exist.
1.13.4. Pro: To demand a two state solution while teaching their kids to kill Jews is immoral:
[Palestinian children TV: kill all jews](https://youtu.be/0ORAM-usqhQ)
1.13.5. Con: Israel doesn't support the creation of a Palestinian State, it is therefore hypocritical of Israel to ask Palestinians to support the creation of Israel.
1.13.5.1. Pro: Israel [threatens](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-no-palestinian-state-under-my-watch/) the [creation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-kerry/israel-seeks-u-s-block-of-palestinian-statehood-drive-idUSKBN0JT1A020141216) of a [Palestinian State](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2009/1115/p01s01-wome.html/%28page%29/2) by taking part in internationally condemned illegal settlements outside of Israel proper \(controlling [42% of the West Bank](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/group-israel-controls-42-of-west-bank/), that which would be a part of a future Palestinian state\). Israel should practice what it preaches.
1.13.6. Con: Recognition of independence should not be based upon retaliation, rather it should be based upon whether a people deserve to represent themselves.
1.13.7. Con: America shouldn't make the decision about whether to recognize Palestine based on how Palestine relates to other actors on the international stage; this decision should be made purely based on how it affects America.
1.13.7.1. Con: The decision of whether to recognize has significant influence on America's relations with Israel, its closest ally in the region. It is therefore in America's interest to take into account how Palestine relates to Israel.
1.13.7.1.1. Con: Favoring American-Israeli relations to that extent weakens the credibility of the USA as a third party in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiation.
1.13.8. Con: The recognition of the Jewish character of state and the recognition of the legal or international legitimacy of a state is not equivalent.
1.13.9. Con: Israeli Knesset does not yet recognize Israel as a Jewish State.
The process has actually being discussed for the first time by Israeli deputees IN APRIL 2018 : [www.timesofisrael.com](https://www.timesofisrael.com/knesset-passes-controversial-jewish-state-bill-in-first-reading/)
1.13.9.1. Con: The issue being discussed in Knesset has to do with certain laws, not with the underlying concept of "Jewish State" -- the Israeli Declaration of Independence states "ACCORDINGLY WE, MEMBERS OF THE PEOPLE'S COUNCIL...HEREBY DECLARE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A JEWISH STATE IN ERETZ-ISRAEL, TO BE KNOWN AS THE STATE OF ISRAEL." [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence#Final_wording)
1.13.10. Con: Palestine Liberation Organization supports legally voted Israeli Arab deputees such as Ayman Odeh. The refusal to recognise Israel as a Jewish state comes from Israeli Arab deputees at Knesset.
For being the voice of Arab Israeli in Knesset or in courts, Ayman Odeh has been shot down by his State's Army, but not killed in 2017 : [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NEZrhhhOw8)
And a few days ago Jafar Farah has been beaten by his State's Police till his knee broke : [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c3twojQa2E)
1.13.11. Con: Palestinians have strong incentives not to recognise Israel as a Jewish state, and therefore should not do so.
1.13.11.1. Pro: Asking Palestinians to accept Israel's right to exist equals asking Palestinians [to accept as justified](https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0202/p09s02-coop.html) what has been done to them over the course of the past decades.
1.13.11.1.1. Con: Accepting Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state in principle in no way constitutes accepting that everything Israel has done is acceptable.
1.13.11.1.1.1. Con: Israel's reference to its claims to the land have been among the justifications for the injustices imposed on Palestinians in the past. [Recognizing](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/09/201192614417586774.html) their right to exist as a Jewish state would be acknowledging the atrocities Israel has done because of this.
1.13.11.1.1.1.1. Con: If recognizing the Jewish state acknowledges or affirms Israeli atrocities or injustices committed against Palestinians, then recognizing the Palestinian state would affirm Palestinian atrocities and injustices committed against Israel.
1.13.11.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Resistance to military occupation is a humanitarian right, not a crime.

[Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts \(Protocol I\), 8 June 1977.](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/b0d5f4c1f4b8102041256739003e6366/6c86520d7efad527c12563cd0051d63c)
1.13.11.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The Geneva convention does not grant anybody the right to attack civilians or put civilians in danger through illegal actions. A war crime is a war crime.
1.13.11.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: This claim falsely assumes that resistance to military occupation is all that Palestians are guilty of in relation to atrocities committed against Israel.
1.13.11.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: In the war of 1948, Palestinian Arabs openly and proudly sought the [total annihilation](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/background-and-overview-israel-war-of-independence) of the Jews.
1.13.11.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.6.4.2.
1.13.11.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Crimes which the Israeli government might be charged with, would be on the condition that they were state sponsored \(e.g. actions by the IDF or settlers transferred illegally by the government\), which no external authority has held them accountable to yet.

On the other hand, Palestine is not a state as of yet. The Palestinian Authority has [control only over a part of the land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority#/media/File:Zones_A_and_B_in_the_occupied_palestinian_territories.svg), and [Israel already punishes](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/01/israel-collective-punishment-jerusalem-attack-170110084017716.html) those even suspected of violence and their families in Israel, in the West Bank, and Gaza.
1.13.11.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.9.3.1.1.2.
1.13.11.1.1.1.3. Con: Much of the harmful actions that the Israeli state has taken against Palestinians have been justified by citing [general security concerns](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/04/israel-50-years-occupation-abuses), not by citing its claims to the land.
1.13.11.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Violence as a means of alleviating personally-perceived fear is not a legitimate argument.
1.13.11.1.1.1.4. Pro: According to the [views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories#Israeli_legal_and_political_views) of most adherents of Religious Zionism and to certain streams of Orthodox Judaism, there are no, and cannot be, "occupied territories" because all of the Land of Israel belongs to the Jews.
1.13.11.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: An extreme [position](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rick-steves/settlements-in-the-west-b_b_3240616.html) held by many conservative Jews as well as conservative Christians is that the presence of Palestinians in the West Bank impedes God’s will.
1.13.11.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: [The Land of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Israel) concept has been evoked by the founders of the State of Israel. It often surfaces in political debates on the status of the West Bank.
1.13.11.1.1.1.5. Pro: Israel uses its claim as a Jewish state to [block](https://www.thenational.ae/the-loaded-terms-israel-uses-to-justify-its-inflexible-stance-1.334411) a peace deal with Palestinians.
1.13.11.1.1.1.6. Pro: Israel [uses](https://www.thenational.ae/the-loaded-terms-israel-uses-to-justify-its-inflexible-stance-1.334411) its claim to the land of Palestine to normalise settlements on Palestinian territory, something that has been recognised as illegal by the international community.
1.13.11.1.1.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.4.4.1.
1.13.11.1.1.1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.
1.13.11.1.1.2. Pro: Accepting Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state could be seen as a way to acknowledge the reality and legitimacy of Israel's existence, and the interest for a future where both nations can exist, in peace.
1.13.11.1.1.2.1. Con: Israel does not support a democratic Palestinian state, though that could also lead to peace.
1.13.11.1.2. Pro: For many Palestinians, the existence of Israel is necessarily predicated on the [1948 expulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_exodus) of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.
1.13.11.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.6.4.2.
1.13.11.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.3.
1.13.11.2. Pro: Palestinians may want to not recognise Israel as Jewish in order to protect the legitimacy of their claims of religious access to Jerusalem.
1.13.11.2.1. Pro: Recognition that Israel is Jewish could legitimise Jewish demands for access to the [Temple Mount](https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-10-22/long-running-jerusalem-dispute-heats-again), which would violate Islamic religious instruction.
1.13.11.2.2. Pro: If Israel is recognised as Jewish, then all religious sites within Israel get recognised as primarily Jewish. This gives Israel the justification it needs to restrict the ability of Muslims to access these sites.
1.13.11.2.2.1. Pro: UNESCO has [criticised](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/10/unesco-controversy-over-jerusalems-holy-sites/504149/) current Israeli policy of restricting access to religious sites for Muslims in Jerusalem. It will only likely increase after recognition of Israel as Jewish.
1.13.11.2.2.1.1. Con: Many [countries don't necessarily agree](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/10/unesco-controversy-over-jerusalems-holy-sites/504149/) with UNESCO's criticism. UNESCO's draft resolution, the source of UNESCO criticism, received only 24 votes. 26 countries abstained from the vote and 6 countries, including the United States, voted against it.
1.13.11.2.2.2. Con: Recognition of a Jewish state doesn't necessarily imply that religious sites within Israel are primarily Jewish.
1.13.11.3. Pro: Accepting the Jewishness of the state would mean giving up the '[right of return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_right_of_return)' for millions of Palestinian refugees into Israel who left during the 1948 exodus following the creation of Israel.
1.13.11.3.1. Con: There are not millions who left; there are less than 100,000 remaining. The "official" refugee community numbers in the millions only because the surrounding Arab states refuse to grant citizenship to the millions of children and grandchildren born within their borders.
1.13.11.3.2. Pro: Up to [8 million](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4184/palestinian-refugees-return) Palestinian refugees wish to return to Israel, and strongly condemned Mahmoud Abbas's suggestion of giving up their right to return.
1.13.11.3.3. Pro: If this right to return is given up, up to 450,000 Palestinian refugees would be [forced](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/3770/lebanon-apartheid-laws) to continue to live in inhumane conditions in Lebanese refugee camps where they are treated as second-class citizens.
1.13.11.3.4. Con: Palestinian refugees do not have a right of return to Israel.
1.13.11.3.4.1. Pro: [Jewish leadership](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2011/11/israel_and_1948_did_israel_plan_to_expel_its_arabs_in_1948_or_not_.html) did not plan to expel Arabs from the state-to-be of Israel; rather, that was the consequence of outbreak of violence between Arabs and Jews. As a result, the state of Israel bears no responsibility for Palestinians refugees.
1.13.11.3.4.1.1. Con: [According to Ilan Pappé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ethnic_Cleansing_of_Palestine), Israeli Historian, the 1948 Palestinian exodus resulted from a planned ethnic cleansing of Palestine that was implemented by the Zionist movement leaders, mainly David Ben-Gurion, through systematic expulsions of about 500 Palestinian villages, as well as terrorist attacks executed mainly by members of the Irgun and Haganah troops against the civilian population. He also refers to Plan Dalet and to the village files as a proof of the planned expulsions.
1.13.11.3.4.2. Con: Of course they have a right to return. The [UN ruled as such in 1978](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/805C731452035912852569D1005C1201) and enshrines this concept in [Resolution 149](https://www.unrwa.org/content/resolution-194).
1.13.11.3.4.3. Pro: The refugee crisis was caused by the Arab invasion of Israel in 1948. Not only does the responsibility of solving the crisis lie on the shoulders of the Arab states that caused it, many of the Palestinian Arabs who fled did so [voluntarily](https://www.adl.org/education/resources/glossary-terms/palestinian-refugees) to avoid the ongoing war or at the urging of Arab leaders who promised that all who left would return after a quick Arab victory over the new Jewish state.
1.13.11.3.5. Con: Over 850,000 Jews were [expelled](http://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-refugees-from-arab-lands-seek-justice-at-united-nations/) from Arab countries between 1948-70. These refugees have not been given a right of return to their homelands by Arab states, so it is hypocritical to demand that just for Palestinian refugees.
1.13.11.3.6. Con: Even if a right to return for Palestinian refugees did exist, granting it would not only [destroy](https://www.adl.org/education/resources/glossary-terms/palestinian-refugees) the Jewish character of Israel but also endanger its national security.
1.13.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.
1.13.12. Pro: The US should only be willing to recognise Palestine as part of a reciprocal recognition of Israel as Jewish by Palestinians. Recognising Palestine unconditionally gives away a valuable bargaining tool the US has to bring Palestine to the negotiating table. Once a Palestinian state is recognised, the Palestinian Authority has little incentive to negotiate.
1.13.12.1. Con: With the international community finally on its side, it makes little sense for the Palestinian Authority to act belligerent and uncooperative, laying waste to the diplomatic goodwill shown by the US in recognising it as a state.
1.13.13. Con: The demand for recognition as a Jewish state is new and surfaced only recently at the Annapolis Conference of [2007](http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/05/25/should-the-palestinians-recognize-israel-as-a-jewish-state/).
1.13.13.1. Pro: The demand to recognize Israel as a Jewish state is a [delaying tactic](http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/05/25/should-the-palestinians-recognize-israel-as-a-jewish-state/) by Israel.
1.13.13.1.1. Pro: There is [evidence](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.569459) that it was invented by Netanyahu to stymie peace processes with the Palestinians.
1.13.13.2. Con: The demand for a Jewish state is as old as Zionism itself. The Zionist program, adopted at the [First Zionist Congress in Basel in 1897](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/first-zionist-congress-and-basel-program-1897), specified that the “aim of Zionism is to create for the Jewish people a home in Palestine, secured by public law.”
1.13.13.2.1. Pro: '[The Jewish State](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-the-jewish-state-quot-theodor-herzl)', written by Theodor Herzl, is considered to be the foundational text of the Zionist movement and the creation of Israel.
1.13.13.3. Con: The [Balfour Declaration](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-balfour-declaration) \(1917\), the [League of Nations Mandate for Palestine](http://www.mythsandfacts.org/conflict/mandate_for_palestine/mandate_for_palestine.htm) \(1922\), the [Peel Commission Report](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/text-of-the-peel-commission-report) \(1937\), and the [General Assembly Partition Resolution](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/7F0AF2BD897689B785256C330061D253) \(1947\), all recognise a 'Jewish' homeland for the Jews of Israel.
1.13.13.4. Pro: The demand for recognition as a Jewish state was not included in the treaties with [Jordan](http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/peacetreaty.html) or [Egypt](http://www.mfa.gov.eg/Lists/Treaties%20DB/Attachments/645/Peace%20Treaty_en.pdf).
1.13.13.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.6.3.
1.13.14. Pro: The fact that Palestinians do not recognize Israel as a Jewish state is an obstacle to the peace process. The US should therefore demand Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state before recognizing Palestine.
1.13.14.1. Con: Recognition of Israel as a Jewish state would make Arab residents of Israel feel unwelcome and marginalized, leading to domestic problems that could impede a peace process.
1.13.14.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.
1.13.14.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.9.
1.13.14.3. Pro: Recognising a Palestine which does not accept Israel as a Jewish state could be seen as a tacit support for anti-Semitism by the United States.
1.13.14.4. Pro: It is only once a Jewish state is recognised that the Jewish people will no longer feel threatened; otherwise opposition to a Jewish state will be seen as continuing opposition to Israel in practice \([Becker, p. 13](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus108.pdf)\).
1.13.14.4.1. Pro: Only when there is a feeling of security among Israelis can there be true reconciliation.
1.13.14.4.2. Pro: The acceptance of their state's right to exist is particularly important for the people of Israel as they saw themselves opposed by a coalition of states in the past that attacked them with the [explicit goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#The_Arab_League_as_a_whole) of erasing them from the map.
1.13.14.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.3.1.2.
1.13.14.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.6.1.3.3.1.9.1.3.3.1.1.
1.13.14.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.9.
1.13.14.5. Pro: Without guaranteeing the Jewish right to a homeland, it is difficult for Israel to engage in negotiations.
1.13.14.5.1. Con: The Jewish citizens of Israel already have a homeland, even though their state is not recognised as a Jewish one.
1.13.14.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.13.14.4.
1.13.14.5.2. Con: -> See 1.13.13.
1.13.14.5.3. Con: This recognition is only required from the Palestinians, not the international community. There is no reason why Palestinian recognition of a Jewish state is what validates the existence of a Jewish homeland.
1.13.14.5.3.1. Pro: The Palestinian refusal to recognize Israel as a Jewish state is backed by the [Arab League](http://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/1.578785).
1.13.14.6. Con: -> See 1.13.13.1.
1.13.14.7. Con: If recognition of Israel as a Jewish state led to the expulsion of disloyal Arab-Israelis, it would create more problems for the peace process than it solves.
1.13.14.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.4.4.
1.13.14.7.2. Pro: Right wing foreign minister [Avigdor Lieberman](http://www.aljazeera.com/palestinepapers/2011/01/2011124105622779946.html) already plans to swap Arab-Israeli villages in Israel with Jewish-Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
1.13.15. Con: Not all Israelis demand the Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state.
1.13.15.1. Pro: Haredi Jews, who make up 10% of Israel's population, and are expected to make up 25% of the population within a few decades, are, oftentimes violently, [opposed](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2016/may/12/for-haredi-jews-secular-zionism-remains-a-religious-heresy) to the idea of a Jewish state.
1.13.15.2. Pro: Members of the political establishment disagree on whether formal recognition as a Jewish state should be demanded.
1.13.15.2.1. Pro: [Shimon Shamir](http://www.haaretz.com/ask-mustafa-khalil-1.282123), former ambassador to Egypt and Jordan, regards the Jewishness of Israel as an internal matter that should not be put in front of the international community.
1.13.15.2.2. Pro: [Yonatan Touval](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/13/opinion/13iht-edtouval.html), director of international affairs at Tel Aviv University, criticized the demand as an obstacle to peace and as a danger to Arab-Israelis.
1.13.15.3. Con: For half the Jews in Israel, the recognition of their state as the Jewish homeland by the Palestinians is far more important than a peace deal. Only a slim majority does not perceive these issues as important \([IDI, p. 6](http://www.peaceindex.org/files/Peace_Index_Data_April_2016-Eng\(1\).pdf)\).
1.13.16. Con: It is inappropriate to demand from Palestine the recognition of Israel's right to exist or of Israel as a Jewish state.
1.13.16.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.11.1.
1.13.16.2. Con: -> See 1.13.14.4.
1.13.16.3. Con: Recognition by many other nations is a sufficient condition for a state to be legitimate. Therefore, Palestine should recognize Israeli statehood.
1.13.16.4. Pro: Recognition by many other nations is a sufficient condition for a state to be legitimate. Therefore, Palestinian recognition of Israel has no positive effects on Israel, but strengthens Israel's position in relation to already occupied land, its general approach to the Palestinian people, and potential war crimes.
1.13.16.5. Con: Due to the security issues that arise from such close proximity to Israel, and in order to create a lasting climate devoid of hatred but filled with mutual understanding, the above is a crucial first step Palestinians must take before recognizing Palestine.
1.13.16.5.1. Pro: The modern history of European Jewry shapes the current Israeli position regarding their 'right to exist': security predicates peace. Hamas' repeated calls for the destruction of Israel is bound to jog Jewish memories of these tragic times and establish a powerful negative association by contagion.
1.13.16.6. Pro: -> See 1.13.5.
1.13.16.7. Con: Israel is a de jure state. Thus the Palestinian rejection thereof is equivalent to the Palestinians rejecting the sun. It is no more than an International Relations game, which given their dependency on Israel, is counter-productive.
1.13.16.8. Con: By refusing to recognize Israel's right to exist, Palestine positions itself in opposition to many of its international supporters. This is inappropriate and egregious as the Palestinian economy and society are [highly dependent](http://www.themedialine.org/featured/international-aid-lifeline-palestinian-economy/) on international support.
1.13.16.8.1. Pro: A Palestine that opposes Israel's right to exist puts Germany in a problematic position vis-à-vis its support for Palestine. In the word's of [Angela Merkel](https://knesset.gov.il/description/eng/doc/speech_merkel_2008_eng.pdf), her country has a "special historical responsibility for Israel's security" which "will never be open to negotiation".
1.13.16.8.2. Pro: Opposing Israel's right to exist complicates relations with the US. As Barack Obama [told](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/world/middleeast/transcript-of-obamas-speech-in-israel.html) the people of Israel that those "who adhere to the ideology of rejecting Israel’s right to exist -- they might as well reject the earth beneath them and the sky above". "You are not alone" as long as the US exists.
1.13.16.9. Pro: Other states have not recognised Israel as a Jewish state, or been asked to, yet the US does not refuse to recognise those states.
1.13.16.9.1. Con: Most other states are not proximate to Israel or heavily involved with Israel geopolitically, so whether they recognise Israel or not is mostly irrelevant. The same is not true for Palestine.
1.13.16.9.1.1. Pro: Because the future of Palestine is integrally tied to the future existence of Israel and Israel's population, it's particularly vital that Palestine recognizes Israel's right to exist. The same is not true for other countries.
1.13.16.9.2. Con: It would be difficult for the US to withdraw its recognition of established states. In contrast to that, it is easy to reject the recognition of a disputed state.
1.13.16.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.14.5.3.1.
1.13.16.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.13.13.4.
1.13.16.9.5. Pro: Several major American allies, such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, as well as states that receive large amounts of US support, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, [do not recognize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Israel) Israel in the first place.
1.13.16.9.6. Con: At the same time, most other states have never rejected the right of Israel to exist. The context of their relations with Israel is thus different.
1.13.16.9.6.1. Con: Iranian leaders have rejected Israel's right to exist [on numerous occasions](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/03/Iranian-View-of-Israel/387085/), going so far as to describe it as Iran's mission to erase Israel from the map.
1.13.16.10. Pro: Other countries do not require recognition by other states of their affiliation with a certain religion.
1.13.16.10.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.10.1.6.1.2.1.1.
1.13.16.10.2. Pro: Countries like [Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Yemen) have, for all practical purposes, only Muslim citizens yet do not call for their international recognition as Islamic.
1.13.16.10.3. Con: Iran is generally referred to as the "Islamic Republic of Iran", even in the list of [UN member states](https://www.un.org/en/member-states/).
1.13.16.10.4. Pro: A [variety of countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_references_to_God) associate themselves with a certain religion through their constitution, from Australia and Poland to Switzerland and Ireland, yet they usually do not call for international recognition of this association.
1.13.16.11. Pro: No state besides Israel ever demands the recognition of its [right to exist](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2014/03/israel-pm-demands-recognition-jewish-state-20143418424955968.html) as a precondition for diplomatic engagement.
1.13.16.11.1. Con: That is because other states do not have their right to exist challenged consistently, as is the case with Israel.
1.13.16.11.1.1. Con: The Republic of China - better known as Taiwan - is not recognized as a state by the [vast majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Taiwan#Entities_with_no_representation_in_Taiwan) of other states and has its right to exist as a state [rejected by China](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34729538) frequently. Yet Taiwan does not constantly demand recognition.
1.13.16.11.1.1.1. Con: The reason that Taiwan does not demand this recognition is that China [would not tolerate it](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-taiwan-idUSKCN0YH08R). If Taiwan was in a position of greater security, it would likely demand recognition until it got it.
1.13.17. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.10.1.6.
1.13.18. Pro: One of the two former Prime Ministers of the Palestinian National Authority, Ismail Haniyeh, has [pledged](http://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-official-denies-group-could-recognize-israel/) that he will not recognise Israel.
1.13.18.1. Pro: Ismail Haniyeh has recently been [elected](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/ismail-haniya-elected-political-chief-hamas-170506115834018.html) as the new leader of Hamas' political bureau, which illustrates that his view is in line with the official policy of Hamas as an organisation, and therefore the people who vote for it.
1.13.18.2. Con: Hamas officials have publicly [accepted](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2011/05/24/136403918/hamas-foreign-minister-we-accept-two-state-solution-with-67-borders) the creation of two states along the 1967 boundaries. It is often Israel's aggression that provokes harsh rhetoric from Hamas.
1.13.18.3. Con: Hamas [outlined](http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/01/29/hamas.interview/) conditions for a truce with Israel before the 2006 elections in Gaza, indicating how it is willing to be pragmatic when it comes to electoral pressures, even if it does not ideologically accept Israel's 'right to exist'.
1.13.18.4. Con: The same article quotes the Hamas leader as saying 'The question of recognition is non-debatable as long as \[Israel\] occupies our land'. While Hamas has not recognised Israel now, that does not mean it won't if independent states are formed along the 1967 boundaries.
1.13.18.4.1. Con: The organisation has been [adamant](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/hamas-leader-in-gaza-vows-group-will-never-recognize-israel-1.330593) that it will never recognise Israel.
