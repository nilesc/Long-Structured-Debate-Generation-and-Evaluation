Discussion Title: Affirmative Action: Useful Once, Outdated Today?

1. It is time to end [affirmative action](http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/affirmative-action-overview.aspx) in college admissions.
1.1. Pro: The implementation of affirmative action is an administrative burden to the school.
1.1.1. Pro: This increases the cost of attending school, and while higher cost affects all students, it affects minority students more \(like a regressive tax\)
1.1.2. Con: Administrative positions dealing with affirmative action are almost universally staffed by minorities, providing high-paying, high-profile jobs to the people affirmative action attempts to aid.
1.1.3. Con: Colleges already [have complex admissions criteria](https://newrepublic.com/article/114848/college-admissions-criteria-american-vs-british) that seek diversity in other areas, such as people's intended majors, extracurricular activities, personal essays, interviews, etc. A \(comparatively\) simple criteria to assess, such as race or gender, adds little to the workload.
1.2. Pro: Affirmative action inflames racial tensions.
1.2.1. Pro: Affirmative action is unpopular within society, and leads to the resentment of minority groups.
1.2.1.1. Con: The solution to this problem is better understanding on the part of those who feel resentment. Consider white people who would have been accepted to colleges but are rejected because of affirmative action. The only reason they would have been accepted in the first place is because of the unfair playing field provided by oppression of less privileged groups. Once people understand that affirmative action just partially offsets the existing race-based imbalance, they should feel no resentment.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: It is not necessarily true that a person denied a place by affirmative action would not have had that place in a perfect, race-blind meritocracy.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Where a white person would have been accepted into college but for the existence of an affirmative action program, they are likely to internalize a racist perspective towards that process and the minority group as a whole.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: There is no way for the theoretical white person in this argument to know that they would have been accepted into college but for the existence of an affirmative action program. When applicants aren't invited to attend, they just get a yes/no, not a "close but no". Without that knowledge it would be illogical for them to blame the process or the minority group.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: The sorts of people likely to lash out against affirmative action policies probably already hold negative views towards racial minorities.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: There are plenty of people who hold a positive view towards racial minorities and still oppose affirmative action.
1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: These people are more likely to limit their criticism to affirmative action alone, and are unlikely to respond in a violent or aggressive way.
1.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: The Far Right movement sees the inequality affirmative action addresses not as a problem to be solved, but as an outcome to be [desired](http://www.jeanhardisty.com/writing/articles-chapters-and-reports/affirming-racial-inequality-the-rights-attack-on-affirmative-action/).
1.2.1.2.3. Pro: This internalization can lead to white students reacting negatively to minority students on campus like avoiding socializing, not sitting next to them, or forgoing activities where they are present.
1.2.1.2.3.1. Con: If affirmative action did not exist, many of the minority students on campus would not even be there, which means there is less contact between white students and minorities.
1.2.1.2.3.1.1. Con: Even if these instances aren't numerous, they are still undeniably harmful.
1.2.1.2.4. Pro: Some white individuals see affirmative action as ['black privilege'](https://www.amren.com/news/2016/04/its-time-to-talk-about-black-privilege/).
1.2.1.2.4.1. Con: The fact that they have a false opinion about affirmative action should not be a reason to discontinue it.
1.2.1.2.4.2. Con: Black privilege, much like reverse discrimination, [does not exist](http://www.ebony.com/news-views/black-privilege-myth#axzz4aph6muLA).
1.2.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: There is no such thing as reverse discrimination.
1.2.1.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: Though the term exists, the harm it implies does not.
1.2.1.2.4.2.1.2. Con: Discrimination is discrimination. The term "reverse" is used when trying to make two wrongs equal a right. Either way it means discrimination.
1.2.1.2.4.2.1.3. Pro: Discrimination only occurs when a privileged group [uses their power to oppress a disadvantaged group](http://elitedaily.com/news/world/reverse-discrimination-not-real/1077620/).
1.2.1.2.4.2.1.4. Pro: Attempts to rectify systemic injustice are not reversing racism but neutralising it.
1.2.1.2.4.2.1.5. Pro: Racism is a systemic issue embedded in cultures and institutions. Members of minorities have no power to set majority norms within those systems and thus always suffer from - rather than inflict - discrimination.
1.2.1.2.4.2.1.5.1. Pro: 'Reverse discrimination' would require minorities to be the actors doing the discrimination. In the case of affirmative action, the minority groups are not the ones doing the 'discriminating'. Rather, it is action taken by the State or university, both of which are overwhelmingly white institutions.
1.2.1.2.4.2.1.5.1.1. Con: When we \(Americans, mainly white\) discriminated against African Americans, the government, colleges, and universities took part just as much as the people. Discrimination is discrimination, no matter who is doing it. Affirmative action is discrimination by those in charge towards a certain group, putting them at a lower priority than another.
1.2.1.2.4.2.1.6. Con: Reverse discrimination is a [common term](http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/reverse-discrimination) used to describe the practice of guaranteeing people from certain groups that often experienced unfair treatment because of their race, sex, etc. a particular number of jobs, or college places, even when this discriminates people from other groups who had advantages in the past.
1.2.1.2.4.2.1.7. Pro: The very idea of discrimination being reversed suggests that a harm is being mitigated, not created.
1.2.1.2.5. Con: There are other forms of affirmative action that disproportionately benefit white students, which should mitigate this resentment, e.g. [legacy admissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_preferences) in Ivy League schools.
1.2.1.2.5.1. Con: More than half \(50.8 percent\) of [Harvard's](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40812196) next freshman class will be from minority groups. This is up 3.5 percent from last year, showing an increasing effort by the university to include more diversity.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Approximately [two-thirds](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/07/08/poll-finds-public-opposition-considering-race-and-ethnicity-college-admissions) of US adults oppose the consideration of race in college admissions.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: The poll on which the parent is based [also shows](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/354347/new-gallup-poll-affirmative-action-etc-roger-clegg) that 58-37% of Americans \(whites: 51-44%; Blacks: 76-20%; Hispanics: 69-25%\) support affirmative action. This inconsistency is due to an uncertainty about the vague term ‘affirmative action’.
1.2.1.4. Con: The longer affirmative action is in place, the more normalized it will be. Then, people will grow accustomed to it, and this resentment will cease.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: It is not likely to normalize in its current form, as there will always be a group that is disadvantaged by its policies.
1.2.1.5. Con: Resentment of minority groups is a regular thing in larger mainstream societies and would not stop just because of the cessation of affirmative action.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: Generally, there is often a feeling of resentment on the side of the privileged parts of society when a new group gains power. A loss of power within society frequently  [drives conflicts](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/why-do-ethnic-groups-rebel-new-data-and-analysis/4F69AEFBD88FAADE63207FF7D1F69449) with government, as different ethnonationalist factions lay claims to state power.
1.2.1.5.2. Con: The fact that something bad \(i.e. resentment\) already exists doesn't negate the harm that accrues when it gets worse, as is the case here.
1.2.1.5.2.1. Con: It is unclear what the marginal addition of resentment would actually lead to, given there exist a multitude of reasons one finds to justify resentment towards minorities.
1.2.1.5.3. Pro: Indeed, to the extent to which resentment is triggered by a loss of personal privilege \(such as disproportionate access to education\) as opportunities become evenly spread, it is better to view this resentment as an inevitable stage in creating a more equal society.
1.2.1.6. Con: As of 2014, 63% of Americans considered affirmative action programs that seek to increase the number of black and minority students to be ‘[a good thing](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/22/public-strongly-backs-affirmative-action-programs-on-campus/)’.
1.2.1.7. Con: Whether affirmative action leads to minorities being marginally more resented is probably less important than improving their educational achievement.
1.2.2. Pro: Categorising students based on their race creates an 'us vs. them' mentality.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Minority groups can be pitted against each other when one has access to affirmative action, but the other does not \(e.g. Black Americans and Asian Americans\).
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Affirmative action programs can and should exist for multiple forms of oppression \(e.g. race and gender\). This limits the extent to which marginalized groups feel in competition with each other.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Even though [70 percent](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41928806/ns/business-us_business/t/men-falling-behind-women/#.WIJ3alUrLIV) of high school valedictorians are women, they are still admitted into elite colleges at lower rates than men.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Most Americans favor affirmative action programs for [women](http://www.gallup.com/poll/184772/higher-support-gender-affirmative-action-race.aspx).
1.2.2.2. Con: The diversity that affirmative action brings to college campuses should allow people to view minorities as heterogeneous groups, and connect with their fellow students as individuals, rather than a mere product of their race.
1.2.2.3. Pro: This 'us vs. them' mentality can lead to division within a minority group in college, separating those who are academically successful and those who are not.
1.2.2.4. Pro: White individuals see affirmative action students as "others" because of the seemingly easier route they had to university.
1.2.2.5. Con: This categorization only occurs in the anonymous admissions process. People are not explicitly classified by race on campus.
1.2.2.5.1. Con: Even without explicit categorisation, racial difference is often visible.
1.2.3. Pro: By recognizing racial distinction, affirmative action aids the establishment and promulgation of racial distinction itself.
1.2.4. Pro: Affirmative action encourages 'race policing' because, in order to claim an affirmative action place, students have to prove their race to administrators.
1.2.4.1. Con: Whoever would rather not go through the process could abstain from doing so.
1.2.4.2. Pro: This is especially harmful for Indigenous students, who may not have strong lineage but still practice their culture.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Colleges often define race in a problematic way.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: For example, [Rachel Dolezal](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/rachel_dolezal_claims_to_be_black_the_naacp_official_was_part_of_the_african.html) received an affirmative action spot to attend Howard College, despite not actually being Black.
1.2.4.3.1.1. Con: Rachel Dolezal went on to [sue](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/15/rachel-dolezal-sued-black-college-for-discriminating-against-her-for-being-white/) Howard University in 2002 for reportedly denying her a teaching post and scholarships because she is white.
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: The growth in [multiracial applicants](https://nytimes.com/2011/06/14/us/14admissions.html) could further erode the original intent of affirmative action, which is to help disadvantaged minorities.
1.2.4.3.2.1. Pro: An applicant of mixed white and Black parentage will likely apply as a Black applicant to further their chances of success in applying for admissions.
1.2.4.3.2.1.1. Con: An applicant of Black and white parentage may simply choose the race they most identify with or how they are viewed in society \(e.g. physical features appearing 'more white' or 'more Black\).
1.2.4.3.2.1.2. Con: A legacy of oppression and erasure equally exists for mixed race people \(for example '[one-drop' laws](http://healthland.time.com/2010/12/10/whos-white-whos-black-who-knows/)\), meaning they are legitimate in claiming Black identities and affirmative action places.
1.2.4.3.2.2. Con: At only [6.9%](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/06/11/multiracial-in-america/) of the population, multiracial individuals are still considered a minority race. Thus, disadvantaged portions of this population are still eligible for affirmative action.
1.2.4.4. Con: Most colleges use self-identification as the primary metric by which to assess race for affirmative action purposes.
1.2.4.5. Con: Affirmative action is implemented in colleges in response to the amount of unfair 'race policing' many minorities have historically faced when applying to their university of choice. Thus, it is a resolution, not an encouragement.
1.2.4.5.1. Con: Historically, doing things to make up for past oppression leads to terrible acts.
1.2.4.6. Pro: Having to 'justify' an inherent characteristic of your identify to a bureaucracy is arduous.
1.2.4.6.1. Pro: Minority students who appear white might have their heritage questioned, requiring them to then prove a core part of their identity in bureaucratic terms.
1.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.
1.2.6. Con: Affirmative action itself \(though it might play a part\) isn't what inflames racial tensions, but a number of connected issues already simmering under such multiracial societies.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Ultimately, resolution of these connected issues comes through increased empathy between racial groups and better integration. Affirmative action helps this.
1.2.7. Con: Brown vs Board of Education, which ended segregation in education, [inflamed](https://blog.oup.com/2007/07/brown_v_board_of_education/) racial tensions, yet no one would argue that ending racial segregation in schools should not have occurred. People getting angry is not a reason to not do something.
1.2.8. Con: The exposure of students to racial and cultural diversity in college has [a positive, indirect effect](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/458112/summary) on their recognition of racism.
1.2.8.1. Pro: Race-conscious curricula and cross-racial contact are [important factors](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0002831212468048) in the recognition of racial cognizance and the promotion of racial justice actions.
1.2.8.2. Pro: Affirmative action and the ensuring diversity helps to reduce the perception by black high school students that colleges are elitist hotbeds of racism populated by white lecturers and students.
1.2.8.3. Pro: According to [contact theory,](http://www.iaccp.org/sites/default/files/pettigrew_tropp_2006_contact_theory_0.pdf) merely having different racial groups interact with each other reduces intergroup prejudice.
1.2.8.4. Con: Students tend to socialise with people achieving similar academic outcomes. The [relatively lower achievement](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-painful-truth-about-affirmative-action/263122/) of affirmative action students, coupled with cultural difference, means they [tend to socialise mostly with each other](http://www.seaphe.org/pdf/arcidiacono-social.pdf), rather than integrating with the rest of the student population.
1.2.8.4.1. Con: Not all affirmative action students do worse. With more affirmative action students, there will also be more who do well, and thus socialise with peers who have more academic success.
1.2.8.4.2. Con: Even if this were true, this at least increases the probability that they interact with a greater diversity of students. This would not be able to happen for many minority students without affirmative action policies.
1.2.8.4.3. Con: People socialising in cliques isn't unique to minority students - students of all types primarily socialise with those that they share a backround.
1.2.8.4.4. Pro: Instead of reaching for higher academic outcomes, this puts affirmative action students at risk for staying at the same lower achievement level, and thus reducing the chance of socioeconomic and academic advancement needed to be successful.
1.3. Pro: Affirmative action fails at its intended purpose.
1.3.1. Con: Affirmative action policies can take generations to see their full effect, so it is impossible right now to properly evaluate their efficacy.
1.3.1.1. Con: Affirmative action has existed for a long time. Already in 1978, [the Supreme Court ruled](http://www.civilrights.org/equal-opportunity/fact-sheets/fact_sheet_packet.pdf) that affirmative action policies are permitted in university admissions programs. Forty years should be enough to assess their efficacy.
1.3.2. Pro: Affirmative action often puts the students it is intended to help in a position where academic failure is more likely than success.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Affirmative action sets up minorities for failure as they will be on average unable to compete based on their merits in college and their careers. Instead we must address the root cause directly.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Affirmative action places students into a competitive academic environment, without equipping them with the necessary skills for success. This has a negative effect for students accepted from lower achieving schools.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Because of a mismatch in academic preparation and experience, Black law school graduates from low performing, poorly-funded secondary schools are more likely to [fail the bar exam](http://www2.law.ucla.edu/sander/Systemic/final/SanderFINAL.pdf) than their white peers.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: There is no evidence that current levels of affirmative action reduce the probability of a Black law student becoming a lawyer. [\(Ayres and R. W. Brooks, p. 1809\)](http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2230&context=fss_papers)
1.3.2.2.1.2. Con: If an affirmative action program is the only reason a Black student was able to enroll in a law degree, the alternative is no chance of passing the bar exam. As such, affirmative action programs improve the situation - they just don't solve it entirely on their own.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: Finding a way to help students from lower achieving schools meet the academic skills required to be successful in college should be the goal, instead of stopping a policy that allows them access to their choice of higher education.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Con: If such policies existed and worked, affirmative action wouldn't be necessary.
1.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: Affirmative action fairly distributes academic opportunity to marginalized groups.
1.3.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: College admission processes are notoriously opaque and subjective. Affirmative action is an important safeguard against potential discrimination at the hands of selectors.
1.3.2.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: Tendencies towards supporting familial ties are an example of college admission being less than purely meritocratic.
1.3.2.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: Essays are marked more harshly when the marker [knows that the author is black](http://www.nextions.com/wp-content/files_mf/14468226472014040114WritteninBlackandWhiteYPS.pdf).
1.3.2.2.2.2.1.3. Con: The same discrimination can happen for other sectors of applicants for whom the affirmative action safeguard does not apply \(e.g. applicants of low socioeconomic status\).
1.3.2.2.2.2.1.3.1. Con: Colleges give more weight to first generation college students, which counterbalances this effect on low-income students.
1.3.2.2.2.2.1.3.2. Con: Low-income students are more often minority though, so the safeguard usually works for both groups.
1.3.2.2.2.2.2. Con: Affirmative Action breaks all of humanity into [one of 7 groups](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/race-and-ethnicity/archive/labor-force-characteristics-by-race-and-ethnicity-2014.pdf) through definitions that have no necessary link to marginalization.
1.3.2.2.2.2.3. Con: [Fair](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fair) means treating people equally. And without [discrimination](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/discriminate). Giving people different advantages based on their ethnicity, differentiates between people.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4. Pro: Affirmative action means that intelligent, meritorious candidates who would otherwise be overlooked are given the opportunity to achieve their potential.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.1. Con: Missing from the parent is the qualifier, "at the expense of a different candidate, who may be more intelligent and meritorious."
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.2. Pro: Affirmative action takes into consideration the fact that many under-represented minority students did very well given their set of limited opportunities.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.2.1. Con: If one truly compares performance to resources available on an *individual* basis then there is no need to look at race. Otherwise this assumes *all* members of a certain race \(white, black, etc.\)  are all the same \(in a given metric : access to resources\). That is the definition of racism.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.2.2. Con: If the goal is college entrance testing is PREDICTING performance then it should consider *actual* starting point \(quality of schools, wealth of family\), etc. rather than *assuming* a starting point based solely on race. \(That would be racial profiling\)
It can compare students from the same school and family income to normalize "starting point".
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3. Con: Affirmative action destroys the idea of meritocracy, by giving preference to minority students based on race rather than academic merit. This puts white students who may be more academically qualified at a disadvantage.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.1. Con: White individuals have numerous systemic advantages. It is unlikely that this policy will make their lives unfairly worse.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.2. Con: Affirmative action is in line with the idea of meritocracy. It is simply taking into account factors that are not traditionally included within merit-based systems but should be.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.2.1. Pro: Though some affirmative action beneficiaries may be less academically qualified, they often make up for it through other skills \(e.g. hard work, adaptability and resilience\).
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.3. Con: This ignores the structural factors that make those white students more academically qualified in the first place.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.4. Con: Even with affirmative action, [white students](https://changefromwithin.org/2012/06/06/are-white-students-being-disadvantaged-by-affirmative-action/) are still more likely to enroll and attend college in comparison to minority students. Thus, they are not being disadvantaged.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.4.1. Con: On the margins, an affirmative action policy necessarily means that some more qualified candidates from overrepresented backgrounds miss out on places that get redistributed to minorities.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5. Pro: It would be more fair, and more effective, to fix the gaps in achievement between minorities and majorities prior to college entry.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1. Pro: Addressing educational inequality at a college level through affirmative action comes too late to create effective academic balance.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.1. Pro: Affirmative Action addresses the symptom, not the cause. We should address the causes and watch the symptom to measure the effectiveness of the solution.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.2. Pro: The resources used to create and implement affirmative action policies would be better directed to primary and secondary schooling.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.2.1. Con: There is no reason why improving all levels of education cannot be done simultaneously.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: Affirmative action is not a policy that takes up resources. It does not cost tax dollars to implement affirmative action policies.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.2.2. Pro: This would expose students to diversity in schools at a younger, more impressionable age making the transition into college less of a culture shock.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.2.3. Pro: Students from primary and secondary schools with poor academic performance will have a chance to attend better performing schools, giving them a better chance at succeeding in college.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.2.3.1. Pro: As a result, intervention at an earlier age helps to redress inequality in college admissions without having to specifically target it.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.3. Con: Affirmative action is a policy targeted at promoting educational achievement at the highest levels. It has seperate goals, and is complementary to, broader policies that aim at achieving general education achievement.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.3.1. Con: The fact that similar, complementary policies do not seem to exist at lower levels of education suggests this is probably not the case.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.3.1.1. Con: This could suggest many things: that different policies are effective at different levels of education, that secondary schooling equality programs are lagging behind tertiary level programs, and so on.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.4. Pro: By the time students get to college, the educational divide can span years of school learning.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.5. Con: It is critical that we preserve equitable policies for college admission specifically, because it is the first level of education that is not universally guaranteed.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.6. Con: Affirmative action programs can fuel improvements at lower levels in the education system.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.6.1. Pro: A greater number of minority college graduates can mean a greater number of qualified teachers from minority-dominated areas, improving teaching quality in primary and secondary systems.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.6.2. Pro: A greater number of minority students being accepted into colleges can inspire more students from their schools and local areas to aspire to college, fuelling overall educational performance.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.6. Pro: All other aspects of the college operate on meritocratic principles. Having affirmative action policies in place undermines the integrity of these institutions and the pursuit of academic excellence.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.6.1. Pro: Recruitment based on color and not merit brings down the academic record of the school by excluding those who would perform better.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.4. Pro: Given the vast level of [educational inequality](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/06/inequality-public-schools/395876/) in the United States, academic and extra-curricular achievement are unreliable indicators of intelligence and/or merit.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.4.1. Con: No indicator is perfect, but academic scores are a reasonably accurate indicator of future success.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.4.1.1. Pro: [There is a very strong correlation between SAT scores and future income.](https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/sat-scores-and-family-income/?_r=0)
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.4.1.1.1. Con: This is likely only true because people believe that academic scores are a good indicator and thus hire accordingly. It does not actually prove the academic scores are accurate.
1.3.2.2.2.2.4.4.2. Pro: A lack of teaching and learning resources can cause some students to under-achieve.
1.3.2.2.2.2.5. Pro: Assuming we consider all races equally intelligent, we would expect to see them equally represented in higher education. That we don't suggests the admissions process is discriminatory, not affirmative action.
1.3.2.2.2.2.5.1. Con: Assuming all races are equally intelligent does not imply that they all are equally prepared for college. Certain races disproportionately experience disadvantages prior to the college admission process, causing them to be generally not as prepared and therefore less likely to quality for college even in a non-discriminatory admissions process.
1.3.2.2.2.2.5.2. Con: All races might not be equally intelligent, so the assumption may be mistaken and damaging.
1.3.2.2.2.2.5.2.1. Con: [Race is a social construct](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/04/race-genetics-science-africa/) and, scientists largely agree[there is no evidence intelligence varies by race](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/02/the-unwelcome-revival-of-race-science).
1.3.2.2.2.2.5.3. Con: Equal intelligence does not lead to equal representation in higher education. A much bigger part of the admissions process is how hard you have worked and studied.
1.3.2.2.2.2.5.3.1. Con: However the same logic should apply to this. There should be no reason why people from different races should have different levels of work at school. This points to systemic disadvantage.
1.3.2.2.2.2.5.4. Pro: Candidates with 'Black sounding' names were [50% less likely to be interviewed](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/15/jalen-ross/black-name-resume-50-percent-less-likely-get-respo/) than their 'white sounding' counterparts. A similar subconscious bias likely impacts college admissions.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6. Con: Affirmative action aims to distribute spots to people who would otherwise miss out, but in practice often ends up going to the most privileged members of the marginalised community, most of whom would have been able to access college anyway.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.1. Pro: That a person belongs to a certain minority group does not necessarily mean that it is more difficult for them to get admitted to college.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.1.1. Pro: Determining the level of disadvantage of an individual based on the groups that an individual belongs to \(race, gender, sexual orientiation, etc.\) is not likely to be as accurate as measuring the individual's disadvantages directly \(poverty, community and family instability, lack of educational opportunities, medical disability, etc.\). Therefore, help given to an individual should be based on their actual disadvantages, not the average disadvantages of the groups they belong to.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.1.2. Con: Statistics show that certain minorities have a disproportionately low rate of admission.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.4.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.1.3. Pro: Poverty is a larger disadvantage than race.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.1.3.1. Pro: In the US, students that come from educated and wealthy backgrounds are [seven times more likely](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wyatt-troia/affirmative-action-currently-fails_b_3773874.html) to obtain a bachelor’s degree than students from poor countries. White students are only twice as likely to graduate than black students.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.1.3.2. Con: Black-Americans are far more likely [to be poor](http://blackdemographics.com/households/poverty/), and far more likely to live in [concentrated poverty](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/12/black-poverty-differs-from-white-poverty/?utm_term=.968adcba832e). If affirmative action policies help this group to reach college, they are reaching out for some of the most vulnerable.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.2. Pro: The harm of this is not only that those who are more in need miss out. It also sends the message that the problem has been fixed which makes it harder for other programs to attract the required political capital to be implemented.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.3. Con: Even if affirmative action only benefits the most privileged members of a marginalized community, they are now able to attend better institutions than they would have otherwise. This still benefits the marginalized community.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.3.1. Con: A member of a community gaining success does not guarantee a betterment of said community. Many successful people choose not to "give back" to their communities as a whole.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.3.2. Con: This needs to be considered relative to the people who miss out, e.g. white people from extremely bad socioeconomic circumstances, people with disabilities or people from other marginalised racial/ethnic backgrounds. They might benefit from this opportunity more.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.3.2.1. Con: There is no evidence that suggests that if affirmative action in colleges was stopped, white people from bad socio-economic circumstances, people with disabilities, or people from other marginalized racial/ethic backgrounds would benefit.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.3.3. Pro: These members of the marginalized community can go on to become leaders within the workforce, which means the marginalized community has more connections and symbols of success.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.3.3.1. Pro: In addition, the high-end work place becomes less white, and thus less intimidating for minorities to become a part of.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.4. Pro: There are relatively [fewer applications](http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/07/27/passing-up-harvard-top-minority-students-skip-top-colleges) to top colleges by minorities from low income backgrounds because of the high cost of college applications and the lack of adequate guidance through the college selection process.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.4.1. Pro: Applicants that come from a family from the bottom economic quartile [only constitute 3%](http://web.archive.org/web/20170112020450/http://www.jkcf.org/assets/1/7/JKCF_True_Merit_Report.pdf) of enrollment at the most competitive schools. \(p.7\)
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.5. Con: If those privileged members would have been able to access college anyway, then in those cases affirmative action is not taking a spot away from anyone else.
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.6. Con: Affirmative action selection processes can always be improved to better target the least privileged members of a minority group \(if they do not do so already\).
1.3.2.2.2.2.6.7. Pro: Some states have already abandoned [race-based](http://www.chronicle.com/article/A-New-Kind-of-Affirmative/134840) affirmative action in college admission because it has failed to fairly include minority students of lower-economic status.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7. Con: Affirmative action distributes opportunities to racially marginalized groups, while ignoring other disadvantaged groups.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.1. Con: There are already many specialized programs for each marginalized group.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.2. Pro: Some minority populations are too small to have quotas put in place for them \(e.g. refugees\), but undeniably are particularly vulnerable and in need of state assistance.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.2.1. Con: Quotas are not the only form of affirmative action. These minorities can also be considered under affirmative action.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.3. Pro: For example, Asian Americans are overrepresented within the college system, and have to score [significantly higher on their SATs](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bernadette-lim/being-asianamerican-in-th_b_7295246.html) to gain college admission as administrators seek to balance racial demographics.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.3.1. Pro: Colleges that admit students based solely on standardised scores - without balancing racial demographics - have a high proportion of [Asian-American students](http://www.dailycal.org/2014/04/18/uc-berkeley-admission-decreases-9-percent-due-new-enrollment-model/).
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.3.2. Con: SAT is [not the only factor](https://professionals.collegeboard.org/guidance/applications/decisions) that determines admission to college. At selective universities the SAT only [plays a small role](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/28/admissions-officers-weigh-in-on-sat/2027843/).
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.4. Con: Even if affirmative action does not solve all oppression, it is still valuable as a means of helping certain people get their education.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.6.3.2.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.5. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.6.1.3.2.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.6. Pro: Obese children have a more difficult time getting admitted to college \([Puhl & Brownell, p. 796](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.490.4017&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\).
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7. Pro: Affirmative action distributes opportunities to racially marginalized groups, but fails to account for the full scope of intersectional oppression. As a result, it locks out students who are the most vulnerable.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.1. Pro: Often a number of relatively small oppressions can amount to someone being significantly disadvantaged, but affirmative action can not account for that.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.1.1. Con: The burden for a policy is not to solve all oppression. If it can solve at least one source of oppression, it is, on balance, a favorable policy.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.2. Pro: For example, a white student from a low socio-economic background who has a disability might be more in need of assistance with college admission than a middle class black student. Rigid affirmative action categories prioritise the latter at the expense of the former.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.2.1. Con: The poor white student is equally unlikely to receive assistance in a world where affirmative action does not exist.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.2.2. Con: Rigid affirmative action categories are the only logistically viable method - admissions administrators don't have the resources to individually assess the privilege of every person applying so they must to rely on broad categorisations.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.2.3. Pro: Students from low socio-economic background receive moderate or no prioritisation. The enrollment of students who are less well off [did not change](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/education/despite-promises-little-progress-in-drawing-poor-to-elite-colleges.html?_r=0) from the 1990s to 2012.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.6.4.1.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.2.4. Con: Affirmative action can exist for students with disabilities. It [already exists in workplace based affirmative action](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/hiring/affirmativeact).
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.2.4.1. Con: Although it exists within the workplace for minorities and the disabled, it still has yet to be implemented for disabled college applicants.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.2.4.1.1. Con: Taking away affirmative action for minorities won't help in implementing affirmative action for disabled college applicants.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.2.5. Con: This is not necessarily a bad thing. Racial minorities have to go through unique struggles that are separate from their economic status.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.2.5.1. Pro: For example, black adult males are disproportionately more likely to be monitored by law enforcement.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.2.5.2. Pro: [Teachers expect less from black and Hispanic students](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/teachers-expect-less-students-color-study-shows/), so a self-fulfilling prophecy is created that makes it more difficult for them to succeed.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.2.5.3. Con: Though their struggles may be unique, that doesn't necessarily make them worse than what others suffer. A truly equitable system would prioritise based on need rather than arbitrary identity characteristics.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.2.5.3.1. Con: Tracking precise levels of societal and economic disadvantage is difficult. As a result, we need to use proxies - characteristics generally leading to disadvantage that can be more easily identified.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.2.5.3.2. Con: One of the most prevalent denominators for these applicants is their race, which is one reason it is used as a consideration for admissions.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.8. Pro: Colleges often claim that they seek a diverse student body, however, often admissions systems [value](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wyatt-troia/affirmative-action-currently-fails_b_3773874.html) race more than any other diversity factor.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.8.1. Con: This, at the very least, promotes racial diversity. Without affirmative action, there would be even less diversity overall.
1.3.2.2.2.2.7.8.1.1. Con: Forced diversity is not the answer. True diversity must be organic or you haven't solved anything, just shoved it under the rug.
1.3.2.2.2.2.8. Pro: Affirmative action has been an effective force to undermine gender inequalities in the US.
1.3.2.2.2.2.8.1. Con: By increasing the number of women earning Bachelor's degrees to a percentage larger than is representative of the population as a whole, affirmative action has created a gender inequality that continues to favor admitting a majority group over a now-marginalized group.
1.3.2.2.2.2.8.1.1. Con: It has been shown that [girls succeed over boys in school](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/09/why-girls-get-better-grades-than-boys-do/380318/) because they are more apt to plan ahead, set academic goals, and put effort into achieving those goals, so it makes sense that more women would get Bachelor's degrees more often.
1.3.2.2.2.2.8.1.2. Con: Men are not a "marginalized group." Even though women get higher education, [men get payed more](https://www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/).
1.3.2.2.2.2.8.2. Pro: Today, women are more educated and compose a larger part of the workforce than ever before,[partly as a result of](http://www.vox.com/2016/5/25/11682950/fisher-supreme-court-white-women-affirmative-action) affirmative action.
1.3.2.2.2.2.8.3. Pro: Affirmative action contributed to the fact that women nowadays [are more likely than men](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/affirmative-action-white-women_us_56a0ef6ae4b0d8cc1098d3a5) to earn a bachelor’s degree, as well as to attend graduate school and college.
1.3.2.2.2.2.8.3.1. Con: The fact that women outnumber men in college degrees just shows that affirmative action is not needed anymore.
1.3.2.2.2.2.8.3.1.1. Con: Women are still underrepresented in many traditionally male-dominated fields of studies, as for example engineering, physical science, as well as computer and information science. \([AAUW, p. 3](http://www.aauw.org/files/2013/02/position-on-affirmative-action-112.pdf)\)
1.3.2.2.2.2.8.3.1.2. Con: This only shows that affirmative action may not be necessary for women in some circumstances. Minority students are still clearly underrepresented in colleges and require affirmative action to help address this imbalance.
1.3.2.2.2.2.8.4. Con: Affirmative action has been [disproportionately favoring white women](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/affirmative-action-white-women_us_56a0ef6ae4b0d8cc1098d3a5) as opposed to minority women. This is unfair.
1.3.2.2.2.2.8.4.1. Con: Even if affirmative action benefited white women more than minority women, that is more fair than the previous situation in which white men were prioritized the most.
1.3.2.2.2.2.8.4.1.1. Con: Benefits that favour one or a few marginalized groups over one or more others create the opportunity for greater disparity between the then larger privileged grouping, and the then smaller minority grouping.
1.3.2.2.3. Pro: There are particularly [high drop out rates](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-painful-truth-about-affirmative-action/263122/) for affirmative action students at college.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Con: In the context of class-based affirmative action policies for students from disadvantaged backgrounds in Israeli universities, students who were admitted due to the policy [did not fall behind academically](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775714000223), even in the most selective majors.
1.3.2.2.3.1.1. Con: This study doesn't take into account the effect for students admitted due to race under affirmative action, which accounts for a majority of students admitted into college under its policies.
1.3.2.2.3.2. Con: There is a risk of a correlation causation fallacy in this statement, considering that classist bias could influence the ability for a student to integrate into a traditionally higher class school environment.
1.3.2.2.4. Pro: Almost half of black college students [rank in the bottom 20%](http://yourdailyjournal.com/bookmark/6987165-A-weak-defense-of-an-obsolete-idea) of their class.
1.3.2.2.4.1. Con: As long as the students graduate, that is much [more significant than their grades.](http://college.usatoday.com/2014/05/10/viewpoint-4-reasons-your-college-gpa-wont-matter-once-you-graduate/)
1.3.2.3. Pro: Even short term academic failure derails students' [long term academic confidence](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-painful-truth-about-affirmative-action/263122/).
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Black students who [are academically mismatched](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-painful-truth-about-affirmative-action/263122/) in an undergraduate course are twice as likely to be derailed from plans to go on to postgraduate study.
1.3.2.4. Pro: Because it makes race particularly salient, affirmative action contributes to the phenomenon of stereotype threat, [which negatively pressures students into thinking they need to do well in order to break those stereotypes.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-a-darity-jr/why-were-wrong-about-affirmative-action_b_5613026.html)
1.3.2.4.1. Con: As affirmative action increases the number of minority students, thus, also the number of minority graduates and professionals, it helps to diminish the stereotype threat.
1.3.2.4.2. Pro: The stress from these negative pressures can result in lower academic performance due to stress and burn-out.
1.3.2.4.3. Pro: The feeling of having to prove oneself can have a negative effect on self-esteem. In this instance, a student's sense of self-worth is tied to the approval of others.
1.3.2.4.4. Con: [Stereotype threat can be overcome](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-science-has-to-say-about-affirmative-action/) with support from university staff and psychologists.
1.3.2.4.4.1. Con: People often do not seek out therapy due to the stigma associated with it.
1.3.2.4.4.1.1. Pro: In particular, many Black Americans forgo seeking out [therapy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/culturally-speaking/201111/why-african-americans-avoid-psychotherapy) to avoid being further stigmatized.
1.3.2.4.4.2. Con: Just because people can mitigate the harm through therapy does not justify putting them under that emotional burden to begin with.
1.3.2.4.4.3. Con: Therapy is not always successful for all students.
1.3.2.4.5. Con: While subconsciously feeling the need to take more difficult courses to combat a stereotype is unfortunate at an individual level, it is probably not a bad thing overall that minority students attempt challenging academic activities.
1.3.2.5. Pro: Being thrust into an environment where you are a minority and are distanced from your family/ community is in many cases antithetical to effective learning.
1.3.2.5.1. Pro: The success of minorities within the college system might be better served by instead increasing funding to historically Black colleges or public colleges in diverse areas.
1.3.2.5.2. Con: [International students](https://www.keele.ac.uk/studentcounselling/thingsnotgoingright/commonproblemsforinternationalstudents/) struggle with social integration, communication, and culture shock when studying abroad away from family/community structure. These can all have a negative impact on concentration and academic performance. This is not an issue unique to affirmative action.
1.3.2.5.2.1. Con: Although studying abroad can cause stress, a study found that international students scored higher than their American peers on their level of [academic challenge](http://nsse.indiana.edu/pdf/research_papers/international.pdf), technology use, and personal development.
1.3.2.5.2.1.1. Con: The economic and historical backgrounds of the set of international students will most likely be very unlike those of American students. If a person's background is a major predictor of success, the level of academic success of international students should not be the expected outcome for American students.
1.3.2.6. Con: Affirmative action is meant to provide equal opportunity and access to higher education, not equal amounts of success. There are other academic factors that help influence that.
1.3.2.7. Pro: College students from low socioeconomic backgrounds face tremendous financial challenges in comparison to other students. This often [forces](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/for-the-poor-in-the-ivy-league-a-full-ride-isnt-always-what-they-imagined/2016/05/16/5f89972a-114d-11e6-81b4-581a5c4c42df_story.html?utm_term=.b41cf34c0e46) them into debt.
1.3.2.7.1. Con: This argument may be a reason for better support for low income students, but not for stopping affirmative action.
1.3.2.7.2. Con: The [unemployment](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/business/economy/its-a-tough-job-market-for-the-young-without-college-degrees.html?_r=0) rate for high school graduates in the US is extremely high at 17.8%. If you include those who are underemployed, the number rises to 33%. College at least increases their employment prospects, and provides the ability to get out of debt after graduation.
1.3.2.7.3. Con: Higher education has a financial payoff, even for those who don't graduate. Despite not gaining a degree, they still earn more than equivalent persons who only complete a high school education [\(Russel Sage pg.6\)](https://www.russellsage.org/sites/all/files/Attewell_Lavin_Chap1.pdf).
1.3.2.7.4. Pro: Even with full-ride scholarships, many students still have to cover out-of-pocket for expensive textbooks and supplies in order to participate in class. For lower income students, this added expense can cause debt and more hardship.
1.3.2.8. Con: Even if these under-represented minority students do comparatively poorly in academics, their situation is bettered by going to college.
1.3.2.8.1. Pro: Under-represented minority students are more easily able to make social connections.
1.3.2.8.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.
1.3.2.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.7.3.
1.3.2.8.4. Pro: It gives the marginalized group of individuals easier access to social capital.
1.3.2.9. Con: This is an unnecessarily absolutist attitude. [This study](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-science-has-to-say-about-affirmative-action/) treated affirmative action students with simple psychological exercises and, over three years, reduced the grade gap between them and their white peers by almost 80%.
1.3.2.10. Pro: Being offered an affirmative action place can push students to attend a more reputable college, even if it isn't the best fit for them \(termed the ['quality-fit tradeoff](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20962)'\).
1.3.2.10.1. Pro: As a result, affirmative action students may choose a college for its prestige, but suffer academically due to a more challenging standard of education.
1.3.2.11. Con: Even if affirmative action students tend not to be successful academically, the college as a whole still benefits from having a more diverse student body.
1.3.2.11.1. Pro: Affirmative action improves education by enabling the presence of more diverse perspectives in the classroom.
1.3.2.11.1.1. Con: Diversity promoted by affirmative action is not always a match for diversity of perspectives generally. A person with a common perspective may be aided by affirmative action rules, while a person with an uncommon perspective may obtain no benefit.
1.3.2.11.1.2. Con: It does not improve the learning experience of those being excluded for the color of their skin.
1.3.2.11.1.2.1. Pro: Acceptance based on anything other than academic intelligence lowers standards and expectations of teachers.
1.3.2.11.1.3. Con: The only diversity that matters in a university is diversity of thought.
1.3.2.11.1.3.1. Con: Diversity of thought is better achieved through diversity of people.
1.3.2.11.1.3.1.1. Con: Diversity of ethnic/racial minorities does not correlate with diversity of thought.
1.3.2.11.1.3.1.2. Pro: Differences in cultural backgrounds are likely to lead to diversity of thought, as perspectives honed by varied experiences in our formative years come to the fore.
1.3.2.11.1.3.2. Pro: There are greater differences within groups than between them. Assuming that diversity of thought is achieved through diversity of race is racist.
1.3.2.11.1.4. Con: In most cases, minorities are not represented in the classroom even when they are physically there.
1.3.2.11.1.5. Pro: This is especially useful in classes that teach about minority experiences. Having minority students participate and provide their firsthand perspective is important to ensure that their lives are not misrepresented and that listening to minority perspectives in general is important.
1.3.2.11.1.5.1. Con: That's equivalent to suggesting war veterans should be admitted into high school, to provide a firsthand perspective when learning about the war. Or politicians, when learning about politics. A person with firsthand knowledge of a topic, does not have to be a student at the school to contribute to that schools education. We don't do this for any other topic.
1.3.2.11.1.5.2. Pro: Due to a lack of minority teachers, [white teachers](https://aacte.org/news-room/aacte-in-the-news/347-student-diversity-is-up-but-teachers-are-mostly-white) are often faced with the task of teaching classes about minority experiences. Having the participation of minority students would be beneficial for a more accurate portrayal of their experience, which is valuable to the curriculum as a whole.
1.3.2.11.1.5.2.1. Con: That is irrelevant to the point above. Just like immigrant teachers being faced with the task of teaching classes about that countries history and culture, which is also an irrelevant point.
1.3.2.11.1.5.3. Con: Asking, or expecting, minority students to recount their personal experiences of oppression is an unfair imposition. These experiences might be particularly traumatic.
1.3.2.11.1.5.4. Con: Asking or expecting students to present their experiences of oppression as a 'case study' to be analysed and interrogated by the class is unfair. This requires huge amounts of emotional labour on the behalf of that individual student and appropriates their identity as a tool for educating majority students.
1.3.2.11.1.5.5. Con: In a classroom situation, where most students do not know each other well, having minority students recount their experiences of oppression in turn makes those experiences \(and thus the racial difference they indicate\) the defining feature of those students' identities in that learning environment. This removes the agency those students have over how they approach learning and discussion.
1.3.2.11.1.5.6. Pro: We should normalise the idea that minority groups' experiences of oppression should be listened to as a matter of priority.
1.3.2.11.1.5.6.1. Con: Descriptions of experiences are subjective in nature. Putting a strong priority on unsubstantiated, personal stories should be of little importance in intellectual and academic pursuits.
1.3.2.11.1.5.6.2. Con: Anecdotes are not representative of reality. By basing education on anecdotal evidence, you create an unhealthy inaccurate view of the world, to an even bigger degree than life in general does to all of us. Education should be a bedrock of knowledge built on statistics and research.
1.3.2.11.1.5.6.2.1. Con: Anecdotes are needed as a baseline because [black studies programs generally receive low funding](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-experts-black-studies-programs-facing-campus-2015nov19-story.html).
1.3.2.11.1.5.6.2.2. Con: Anecdotes can sometimes draw attention to larger, little-noticed trends. For example, anecdotes of police brutality had been claimed for years before youtube videos made the trend more obvious.
1.3.2.11.1.5.6.2.2.1. Con: Anecdotes of violence in the Black population was also claimed for years. One cannot discern the right from the wrong without statistics and logical thinking.
1.3.2.11.1.5.7. Pro: Having members of a minority group present wider ideas \(colonialism; structural discrimination\) in terms of their own lived experience helps concretise what are otherwise somewhat abstract ideas and discussions.
1.3.2.11.1.5.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.
1.3.2.11.1.6. Con: It should not be the burden of minority students to bring their own diverse perspectives into the classroom. Educators should be seeking them out and including them in the curriculum \(e.g. through set readings or guest lectures\).
1.3.2.11.1.6.1. Pro: For these students, the burden of having to challenge racist opinions in their learning environment is both unreasonable and damaging.
1.3.2.11.1.6.1.1. Con: Diverse perspectives are not limited to the subject of race. It includes perspectives on many subjects \(e.g. mental health, religion, literary interpretation\) in which a student's race and personal experience play a role. Thus, diversity in the classroom is a tool for exposing students to many different viewpoints, which enhances the learning experience.
1.3.2.11.1.6.1.1.1. Con: Regardless of the subject matter, learning via being exposed to a diverse or different opinion almost always comes at the expense of the person whose lived experience was initially erased or undermined.
1.3.2.11.1.6.1.2. Con: Challenging these opinions in the classroom also gives minority students a chance to denounce falsehoods while sharing their authentic experiences. This is likely to be empowering instead of damaging.
1.3.2.11.1.6.2. Pro: The emotional labour of having to constantly advocate for the recognition of rights meaningfully detracts from minority students' ability to apply themselves to their studies.
1.3.2.11.1.6.2.1. Con: It is not necessary to constantly advocate for their rights in order to bring diversity to the campus. Just their existence is a valuable point for diversity.
1.3.2.11.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: Even if an affirmative action student is conservative and does not support social justice movements, they are still a welcome perspective on the campus.
1.3.2.11.1.6.2.1.2. Con: In order for the benefits of diverse perspectives to accrue, students need to be willing to share their lived experiences with the class. This expectation is burdensome in and of itself.
1.3.2.11.1.6.2.1.2.1. Con: This is not necessarily true. Having a lot of black students means that a network of black students would exist for prospective black students. They do not have to share their lived experience to add a diverse perspective to the campus.
1.3.2.11.1.6.2.2. Pro: This applies to both university wide policies and the micro-aggressions that minority students often endure \(e.g. being spoken over in class, or treated with suspicion on campus\).
1.3.2.11.1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.11.1.5.2.
1.3.2.11.1.6.4. Con: It may not be ideal, but it is the least harmful option. Without the minority students representing their own perspectives, the classrooms are white-washed.
1.3.2.11.1.6.5. Pro: It is also unfair to presume that an individual is willing or able to speak to the needs and experiences of an entire marginalized community.
1.3.2.11.1.6.5.1. Con: People can listen to the experiences of the individual from the marginalised community without generalising that experience as belonging to everyone from that community.
1.3.2.11.1.6.5.2. Con: With more students from marginalised communities in the classroom, the chance is far greater that at least one of them is comfortable speaking about the needs of their community. Indeed, affirmative action spreads the burden of doing so across a greater number of students, relieving those who are uncomfortable or unwilling to speak about their communities.
1.3.2.11.1.6.6. Con: Sharing one's relevant insight on the curriculum being presented is part of participating in class. It is collectively the input of all students that creates engaging dialogue, and thus diverse perspectives within a course of study.
1.3.2.11.1.6.6.1. Con: Whilst sharing your perspectives on the course material may be a prerequisite for class participation, opening up about your lived experience, especially where it may be unpleasant or traumatic, is not.
1.3.2.11.1.6.6.1.1. Con: When it comes to discussing course material, students are not forced to share personal information, it is voluntary.
1.3.2.11.1.6.6.2. Con: This is often detrimental in practice, because minority students are expected to be an 'expert' on speaking about minority issues, without an equivalent burden existing for students with majority characteristics.
1.3.2.11.1.6.6.2.1. Con: Educators do not view their minority students as 'experts', but rather an authentic voice that may share similar experiences with the topic at hand \(e.g cultural traditions\).
1.3.2.11.1.6.6.2.2. Pro: By singling out minorities as experts, it suggests to white students that 'race' only affects minorities. This neglects that white students are affected by conceptions of 'race' too.
1.3.2.11.1.6.6.2.3. Pro: As speaking time in class is limited, every comment on one's 'minority experience' diminishes the opportunities to make contributions in one's field of expertise.
1.3.2.11.1.6.6.2.3.1. Con: A student's expertise is not always required for the subject being studied. For example, a Black student with expertise in physics would not likely be asked about this in a Black American literature course. Thus, it does not diminish their expertise.
1.3.2.11.1.6.6.2.3.2. Con: Contributions on 'minority experience' typically come about in class discussion where this topic is relevant and therefore valuable to all students enrolled.
1.3.2.11.1.6.6.2.3.3. Con: By this logic, every comment or question in a class outside one's field of expertise would diminish one's contributions. However, this is not the case, and therefore it is implausible that comments about 'minority experience' would have a diminishing effect.
1.3.2.11.1.6.6.2.4. Pro: There are reports of students that feel uncomfortable for being singled out as 'experts' or 'spokesperson' \([Chesler et al., p. 115](https://books.google.de/books?id=OhlVpiF8ACAC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=black+students+singled+out+as+experts&source=bl&ots=Hj0JYlyJKo&sig=I98wwc0uqW6SBp9uf2WACBMBsaI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhxOPtgNjSAhVHPBQKHZjQAjMQ6AEIKTAD#v=onepage&q=black%20students%20singled%20out%20as%20experts&f=false)\).
1.3.2.11.1.6.7. Con: Even without affirmative action, there is likely to be some diversity within the classroom, although less. This concentrates the burden on this smaller group, which is likely to be more harmful than if more students existed and could offer support.
1.3.2.11.1.6.8. Con: Minority communities have asked to let their voices be heard. This policy is respecting their wishes.
1.3.2.11.1.6.8.1. Pro: Minority students may feel like their voice does not matter in class or on campus. Speaking up for their race or heritage may instill them with a sense of pride and self-confidence.
1.3.2.11.1.6.8.2. Con: While minority groups, as broad communities, might desire that more attention is paid to their experiences in general that doesn't mean that individual minorities should be obligated to speak up when it causes them distress.
1.3.2.11.1.6.8.2.1. Con: The individual minority students who do not want to speak up do not need to. This just provides a platform for those in the community that do want to be able to express their concerns and present their issues.
1.3.2.11.1.6.9. Con: -> See 1.3.2.11.1.6.5.2.
1.3.2.11.1.6.10. Con: -> See 1.3.2.11.1.6.8.2.1.
1.3.2.11.1.7. Pro: Exposure to a variety of perspectives in the classroom can create interest in learning more about one's classmates \(e.g. their religion, traditions, or thoughts on other related curriculum\), which can improve sociability and classroom experience.
1.3.2.11.1.7.1. Pro: [Ethnic studies courses](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-ongoing-battle-over-ethnic-studies/472422/) in particular can help build connections between students by dispelling racial myths and opening discussing on how students can collectively contribute to solutions..
1.3.2.11.1.7.2. Con: Focus of college education ought to be on imparting knowledge and skills, then on social connectivity.
1.3.2.11.1.7.3. Con: A good educator will integrate those diverse perspectives through course content \(e.g. required readings\), rather than relying on students to bring them.
1.3.2.11.1.7.4. Con: Affirmative action makes people feel objectified for their racial heritage.
1.3.2.11.1.7.4.1. Pro: This encourages both people belonging to minority groups and society at large first to see race first and the individual person second.
1.3.2.11.1.7.4.2. Con: Affirming a person's race is empowering and acknowledges the unique experiences they live through.
1.3.2.11.1.7.4.2.1. Con: Every person lives through a unique experience in life regardless of their racial or ethnic background.
1.3.2.11.1.7.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.11.1.6.8.1.
1.3.2.11.1.7.4.3. Pro: People may not identify particularly strongly with their racial heritage, nor feel a sense of oppression, yet this becomes the determining factor when they come to college applications.
1.3.2.11.1.7.4.3.1. Con: Even if they do not feel a sense of [oppression](http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/gatekeeper.html#.WJjCXFUrLIU), it still exists in the college acceptance process. Affirmative action helps protect students from experiencing it.
1.3.2.11.1.7.4.4. Con: Race is already an important part of people's identity, even without affirmative action. The [recent US election](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-09-02/racial-tension-in-the-2016-presidential-election) is a good example of how race operates as an identity marker in society, but also of how politics often reinforces and reminds people of the racial element of their identity.
1.3.2.11.1.7.4.4.1. Con: Colleges should be as apolitical as possible. Governments often try to influence what is taught or how things are taught not based by their intellectual value but by their ideological agenda.
1.3.2.11.1.7.4.5. Con: It is a positive thing that schools signal a desire for racial diversity.
1.3.2.11.1.8. Con: It is harmful for white students to form their entire perspective on an ethnic or cultural group based purely on their interactions with a handful of peers.
1.3.2.11.1.8.1. Con: Affirmative action does not guarantee that the only ethnic or cultural minorities that white students interact with are found in college. It merely increases the diversity of those interactions.
1.3.2.11.1.8.1.1. Pro: Even if it were true that these were the only interactions that these white students had, then this would presumably be better than the alternative where they didn't interact with any ethnic or cultural minorities.
1.3.2.11.1.8.2. Pro: College students of the same color do not necessarily have the same opinion or even the same culture.
1.3.2.11.1.8.2.1. Con: Even if white individuals do not get to interact with every student of color, it is still a sizable sample size to learn from.
1.3.2.11.1.8.3. Pro: This is particularly damaging to white students, if many of the interactions with minority groups in college were negative. They are then likely to hold a negative view of these groups in the future.
1.3.2.11.1.8.3.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that white students will have negative interactions with minority groups.
1.3.2.11.1.8.3.2. Con: This is a risk of any interaction, and does not outweigh the benefits of those interactions generally. Indeed, the chances that a student has nothing but negative interactions with minority classmates decrease the more minority classmates they have, suggesting that the simple solution to that risk is even higher minority intake rates.
1.3.2.11.1.8.4. Pro: If minority students' experiences of oppression, or their political opinions, diverge from what is expected it can backfire and undermine the effective teaching of issues such as racism or colonialism.
1.3.2.11.1.8.5. Con: It is presumably more harmful for them to do so based on no interactions, or interactions with an even smaller group of peers.
1.3.2.11.1.9. Con: The students attending college on affirmative action programs are typically the most privileged within minority groups. By elevating their experience as representative and authentic we enable ourselves to ignore the experiences of the most disadvantaged.
1.3.2.11.1.9.1. Con: Easier admissions for first generation college students addresses this problem.
1.3.2.11.1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.6.
1.3.2.11.1.10. Con: Diversity also has negative effects.
1.3.2.11.1.10.1. Con: The US is a diverse country. Segregation does not lead to a better understanding between the different racial, ethnic, and cultural groups.
1.3.2.11.1.10.1.1. Con: Artificially created ethnic/racial/cultural distribution created by affirmative action does not represent actual local distribution.
1.3.2.11.1.10.2. Pro: Conflict is often driven by not being able to understand the perspectives of other people. As a result, having a more diverse set of perspectives could increase conflict.
1.3.2.11.1.10.2.1. Con: This conflict is likely what is experienced in a real diverse society. It is better confronted and discussed under the educated observation of a professor than in the public without resolution guidance.
1.3.2.11.1.10.3. Con: Diversity itself is not the culprit for increased misconduct, but rather the school staff's lack of training in managing the diverse needs and characteristics of a diverse student body.
1.3.2.11.1.10.3.1. Con: Unless we're talking about individual treatment of every single student "diverse needs and characteristics of a diverse student body" is merely stereotypical generalization.
1.3.2.11.1.10.3.1.1. Pro: Within a race or ethnicity there are people of very diverse needs and characteristics, thus training staff of colleges how to treat people based on their racial or ethnic identity is based on generalizations instead of actual needs of an individual attending classes.
1.3.2.11.1.10.3.2. Pro: Unless universities and colleges are explicitly segregated, classrooms will still have some level of diversity. Either way, teaching staff need to be given appropriate training to manage diverse needs.
1.3.2.11.1.10.4. Pro: Norms around behaviour in the classroom are [culturally relative](http://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/cultural-differences-student-performance/), meaning that students from different backgrounds can behave in radically different ways.
1.3.2.11.1.10.4.1. Con: Students should be exposed to those diverse cultural norms, which will be carried forward into the diverse workplaces they'll be going to.
1.3.2.11.1.10.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.11.1.10.2.1.
1.3.2.11.1.10.4.2. Con: Most of these different norms aren't disruptive to others - a student uncomfortable making eye-contact with authority figures is in no way detracting from others' learning.
1.3.2.11.1.10.4.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.11.1.10.3.2.
1.3.2.11.1.10.5. Pro: A more diverse student body in schools leads [to an increase in](https://www.amren.com/features/2012/04/school-suspensions-more-official-baloney/) racial tensions, verbal abuse of teachers, classroom disorder and serious violent incidents on campus.
1.3.2.11.1.10.5.1. Con: The study referenced was conducted in primary and secondary schools and cannot be compared to colleges. Black students are [more likely to attend](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/02/concentration-poverty-american-schools/471414/) high-poverty schools. The lack of resources and equipment is a more likely reason for the consequences mentioned in the parent.
1.3.2.11.1.10.5.2. Con: This is the interpretation of a [white supremacist organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Renaissance_\(magazine\)), who are hardly neutral commentators.
1.3.2.11.1.10.5.3. Con: A more accurate interpretation of the state of evidence finds that the higher rate of reported incidents in schools with a higher proportion of non-white students [has more to do with institutionalised racism in enforcement](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/black-girls-innocence-georgetown/532050/) - that non-white students are more likely to be punished for misbehaviour than white students, and that their misbehaviour is more likely to be categorised by teachers and schools as "serious", "violent", etc.
1.3.2.11.1.11. Pro: [Socially diverse groups](http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v311/n4/full/scientificamerican1014-42.html) are more innovative and better at solving complex, non-routine problems.
1.3.2.11.1.11.1. Pro: To the extent people of minority groups have divergent life experiences than that of the majority group, having a more racially diverse team means that they can draw from a greater range of perspectives on how to solve a problem.
1.3.2.11.1.11.2. Pro: Even if a racially diverse team didn't actually have a more diverse set of knowledge and experiences, "[simply interacting with individuals who are different forces group members to prepare better, to anticipate alternative viewpoints and to expect that reaching consensus will take effort](http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v311/n4/full/scientificamerican1014-42.html)."
1.3.2.11.1.11.3. Pro: Homogeneity within a team breeds conformity and complacency due to the [fluency effect where more easily-processed information is judged to be more correct](http://call the fluency heuristic: We prefer information that is processed more easily, or fluently, judging it to be truer or more beautiful.). Having slight amounts of conflict and uncertainty within a team helps better scrutinise information.
1.3.2.11.1.11.4. Con: Socially diverse groups are only more effective if everyone within that team feels like they are welcome and their ideas are respected. When diversity is [seen as a forced obligation this may be undermined](https://hbr.org/2016/09/diverse-teams-feel-less-comfortable-and-thats-why-they-perform-better).
1.3.2.11.1.11.5. Con: Diverse groups can also be a cause of corrosive conflict when team members [bring different values, not just different ideas, to the table](https://hbr.org/2016/09/diverse-teams-feel-less-comfortable-and-thats-why-they-perform-better). Outside of a workplace setting \(where you can deliberately recruit for specific characteristics\) it is less likely that everyone will share the same values.
1.3.2.11.1.11.6. Con: Collaborative problem solving by diverse groups might be common in the workplace — where people are united in purpose — but is less characteristic of classroom education where the goal is to explore a range of ideas rather than to 'solve' an issue.
1.3.2.11.1.11.7. Con: Less diverse groups have higher levels of social capital and in turn are [happier and more comfortable](http://news.mit.edu/2014/workplace-diversity-can-help-bottom-line-1007).
1.3.2.11.1.11.7.1. Con: This sense of comfort can ultimately lead to decreased productivity, as workers are less likely to challenge their habits and expectations.
1.3.2.11.1.11.8. Pro: A diverse classroom is valuable, as it has a positive effect on students’ cognitive personal development, broadens their perspectives and stimulates critical thinking. \([Alger, p. 69](https://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/97003B7B-055F-4318-B14A-5336321FB742/0/DIVREP.PDF)\)
1.3.2.11.2. Con: It is wrong to use a minority student to boost diversity if it does not give the student themselves academic benefit.
1.3.2.12. Con: The disenfranchised groups should be able to decide the way in which they pursue their future. Affirmative action does not force them to get a college education but rather makes it a viable option.
1.3.2.12.1. Con: It doesn't make it a viable option, so much as merely present it as one. This can be misleading and damaging.
1.3.2.13. Pro: Black students are shown to aspire to study STEM fields, but will [abandon](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-painful-truth-about-affirmative-action/263122/) these majors at twice the rate of white students due to academic mismatch.
1.3.3. Con: Affirmative action's purpose is to include more minorities in college campuses. It has succeeded in this purpose.
1.3.3.1. Con: Acceptance into a college or program for which a person is not academically prepared causes the person to incur debt without gaining employability.
1.3.3.2. Pro: [Public research universities](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-what-happens-when-you-ban-affirmative-action-in-college-admissions/) that ban affirmative action see a decrease in Black and Hispanic student enrollment. Without it, minority students have a harder time being accepted into these programs, thus it is still needed for this purpose.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: They are not having a hard time being accepted because of discrimination. They are simply less qualified, and are being held to the same standards as anyone would be who is less qualified.
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: These bans have caused on average [a 17% decline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4454423/) of first-time matriculation of underrepresented medical school students of color.
1.3.3.3. Con: Inclusion on its own is not necessarily a benefit. If people do not gain the benefits of being at college \(e.g. finishing a degree, finding employment\), affirmative action should not be considered successful.
1.3.4. Pro: Affirmative action disempowers a marginalized group of people.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Affirmative action policies entice young people into degrees which may not benefit them socially or economically.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Research has shown that college degrees have [less economic utility](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2016/02/19/a-college-degree-is-worth-less-if-you-are-raised-poor/) for people from low socio-economic backgrounds.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: The relevant comparison is not the utility of a college degree for people from different socio-economic backgrounds. Instead, it is important to consider the utility of a college degree compared to not having one at all.
1.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The relevant comparison is not about having a college degree at all. Instead, it is important to consider the utility of having a college degree and the opportunity cost of spending 3+ years away from the workforce.
1.3.4.1.1.2. Con: The same article also says that people from low socio-economic backgrounds will have their expected incomes increase by the same proportion as others who obtain a bachelors degree.
1.3.4.1.1.3. Con: This study shows the [opposite](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/19/rich-students-flock-elite-colleges-study-finds-graduating-college-levels-playing): Although students from wealthy backgrounds are more likely to be admitted, rich and poor graduates from the same college have equal financial success later in life.
1.3.4.1.1.4. Pro: Given the high opportunity costs of college education \(where a degree can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars\) the money might be better spent on more direct forms of assistance to minorities, such as charities that provide healthcare or food.
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: Undergraduate degrees, especially those such as [liberal arts](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/03/14/study-shows-87-decline-humanities-bachelors-degrees-2-years) \(which students from marginalised groups are disproportionately drawn to\), are decreasing in social value relative to their cost.
1.3.4.1.2.1. Con: Many recipients of affirmative action are given full scholarships or [can access Pell Grants](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/pell); as a result they rarely pay for the full cost of their degrees.
1.3.4.1.3. Con: Even if it is not always the best pathway, [those with college degrees make on average a significantly greater amount of money than those without.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-j-lowe/education-is-worth-the-in_b_5767518.html)
1.3.4.1.3.1. Con: This is predicated on those who take up affirmative action spots succeeding, which is sadly often not the case.
1.3.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.
1.3.4.1.3.2. Con: Many affirmative action students end up dropping out. This often leaves them in a worse position than where they started.
1.3.4.1.4. Pro: College degrees cost a lot of money, even on partial scholarships.
1.3.4.1.4.1. Pro: The average net price of attending a 4 year college or university for a full-time undergraduate student is [$25,409](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76) per year.
1.3.4.1.5. Con: -> See 1.3.2.12.
1.3.4.2. Con: Affirmative action opens up career opportunities for marginalized groups of people in high-paying and well-respected job sectors.
1.3.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.3.4.4. Con: Affirmative action leads to more wealth in the hands of these marginalized people, which directly empowers them.
1.3.4.4.1. Pro: With a college education, affirmative action beneficiaries are more likely to secure high-paying and well-respected jobs, thus diminishing negative racial stigmas over time.
1.3.4.4.1.1. Pro: Affirmative action makes it easier for minorities to go to a prestigious university, which in turn [makes it more likely that their income will be higher.](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/08/does-college-matter/400898/)
1.3.4.4.1.2. Pro: When people work alongside individuals from minority groups, they are forced to confront their latent prejudices as they see the efficacy of these individuals at their jobs.
1.3.4.4.1.2.1. Con: They might also just have their prejudices confirmed due to a confirmation bias about affirmative action being unmeritocratic.
1.3.4.4.1.2.1.1. Con: The more competent minority colleagues and classmates someone is exposed to, the harder it is for them to continue to have a complete confirmation bias effect.
1.3.4.4.1.2.2. Con: Where biases are subconscious, individuals are more likely to consider their coworker the exception rather than the rule.
1.3.4.4.1.3. Con: These stigmas are present within the [workplace](http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&context=honors_theses), despite minority representation.
1.3.4.4.1.4. Con: Even with improved socioeconomic status, minorities still endure negative racial stigmas perpetuated by society and the media.
1.3.4.4.1.4.1. Pro: Influential black women like [Michelle Obama](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amandla-stenberg-and-the-sad-reality-of-the-angry-black-girl-stereotype_us_55a5384de4b0b8145f73a3ad) have been classified as the stereotypical 'angry black woman' for sharing their opinions, despite their status.
1.3.4.4.1.4.2. Con: It's a question of relative stigma. While affirmative action is not going to solve the problem of racial stigma in society by itself, by allowing minority students to become successful citizens in society, it reduces the level of stigma.
1.3.4.4.1.4.3. Pro: For example, [Oprah was once racially profiled in a department store.](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/09/world/oprah-winfrey-racism-switzerland/)
1.3.4.4.1.5. Con: Equally, the stigma of only being able to obtain a college degree by way of affirmative action could also follow minorities into the workplace and cast aspersions on their success.
1.3.4.4.1.5.1. Con: If the workplace doesn't also use affirmative action there would be no reason to assume a person got a role for any reason other than their own merit.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2. Pro: Affirmative action programs in college lead to less-qualified professionals in the workforce.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.1. Con: To the extent that program standards are well defined and equally applied, affirmative action would simply give qualified candidates access and an opportunity to prove themselves regardless of their demographics.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.2. Con: Affirmative action and diverse hiring in the workforce is mostly privately initiated, not state enforced. That firms proceed to hire minority graduates suggest they gain a tangible benefit, either in productivity or PR, even if they are supposedly 'less-qualified.'
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.2.1.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.2.2. Pro: Firms that implement affirmative action policies are often seen in a more favorable light in the public eye. It suggests they are supporters of diversity in the workplace.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.2.3. Pro: More diverse businesses are more effective.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.2.3.1. Pro: There is [evidence of a link](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1083851.pdf) between implementation of workplace affirmative action policies and work quality.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.2.3.2. Pro: A diverse set of experiences, perspectives, and skills \(e.g. understanding customs, languages\) gives companies a global reach, expanding their market and thus, profit.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: Companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity were "[35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters)."
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.2.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.11.1.11.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.2.3.3. Pro: Employees of companies with [2D-diversity](https://hbr.org/2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation) - diversity that encompasses both inherent traits \(gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation\) and acquired ones \(learning\) - are 45% more likely to report growth in market share over the previous year.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.2.3.4. Pro: By upholding affirmative action policies in the workplace, companies can receive [government contracts](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/advantages-disadvantages-affirmative-action-workplace-18141.html), a remunerative opportunity.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.3. Con: Affirmative action doesn't lead to less-qualified workers, but rather makes it more likely that employers have a more diverse pool of college educated graduates to choose from.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.3.1. Con: [Diversity](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diversity) means there is variety. But variety in skin-color is not the only kind of variety. And [Genetics](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/genetic-study-shows-skin-color-just-skin-deep-180965261/) would suggest it is not an interesting metric at all. As skin color does not decide what kind of person you are. Therefore more non-whites in your pool of college educated graduates. Does not necessarily make it more diverse.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.3.2. Pro: Affirmative action provides for diverse college entry. It does not provide an easier path to graduation - all students complete the same exams in order to graduate and apply for work.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.3.3. Con: The qualifications for these workers are different and usually [lower](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/209930?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). Otherwise, they would get in without affirmative action.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4. Con: There is a special need for educated minorities in both the workforce and their communities. Affirmative action increases the number of qualified candidates and helps meet this demand.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.1. Pro: For example, having [more teachers from minority backgrounds](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/05/15/the-troubling-shortage-of-latino-and-black-teachers-and-what-to-do-about-it/?utm_term=.2b29e09affe1) has been seen to improve learning outcomes for minority students.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.1.1. Pro: Due to the lack of Black teachers, the US Department of Education launched a scheme encouraging more [Black American men](http://www.thedp.com/article/2011/02/black_men_still_underrepresented_as_teachers) to join the workforce and become role models for young Black men. Affirmative action helps ensure Black people have access to college education so they can go on to train as teachers.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.2. Pro: Having more minority doctors helps [improve medical practice](http://commonhealth.legacy.wbur.org/2012/02/minority-doctors-diversity) as they are more likely to serve their own communities and have a better cultural understanding of the health issues they face.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.2.1. Pro: For example, in medicine, black patients [benefit significantly](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/opinion/sunday/the-case-for-black-doctors.html) from having access to black doctors.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.3. Con: Having too many options can lead to '[overchoice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overchoice)', making it difficult to choose. Thus, having less qualified candidates can lead to less indecision, and an easier hiring process.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.3.1. Con: There is a dire shortage of minorities working in certain occupations \(e.g. [teaching](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/05/15/the-troubling-shortage-of-latino-and-black-teachers-and-what-to-do-about-it/?utm_term=.2b29e09affe1) and [medicine](https://www.statnews.com/2017/01/16/black-doctors-shortage-education/)\). It is highly unlikely that these potential employers will be burdened with 'overchoice' because of affirmative action.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.4. Pro: Right now, companies [want to hire minorities](https://saharconsulting.wordpress.com/2010/03/26/6-advantages-of-workplace-diversity/) but don't have a large enough pool of sufficiently educated applicants to draw from. Affirmative action simply increases the number of qualified candidates, helping to meet the demand for minorities in particular professions.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.5. Pro: A number of high-ranking officers and civilian leaders of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps [argued](https://www.aclu.org/files/images/asset_upload_file670_37287.pdf) that affirmative action in college is important to ensure a highly qualified and racially diverse officer corps, which is essential to provide national security.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.5.1. Pro: In a brief, they [pointed out](http://www.longviewinstitute.org/research/karabel/security/view/) that affirmative action is needed to increase the pool of minority officer candidates and, thus, constitutes a compelling government interest.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.5.2. Con: This refers specifically to military schools, but is not relevant to the vast majority of cases.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.5.3. Con: The U.S. military is [notoriously racist](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-wisconsin-shooting-army-idUSBRE87K04Y20120821), and it is unconscionable that they would coerce minorities into their ranks with affirmative action spots.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.5.3.1. Con: Affirmative action spots in the military are not coercive. They provide an option to people who would otherwise not have that option.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.5.3.2. Con: Having more minorities in the army may reduce soldiers' racism.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.5.3.2.1. Pro: As they become more intimate with people of diverse backgrounds, they are more likely to realize that racial stereotypes are bigoted.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.5.4. Pro: Although minorities make up 40 percent of US residents, currently they are represented in [less than 20 percent of senior diplomats and 15 percent of senior military officers and senior intelligence officials](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/10/05/building-national-security-workforce-fully-reflects-america).
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.5.5. Pro: Diversity benefits national security by having a variety of different perspectives, strengths, and cultural understanding \(e.g. language, behaviors, and customs\) that is beneficial in making decisions that include diverse groups.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.5. Con: [Diverse teams are more effective in business](https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter). Even if job candidates who benefitted from affirmative action are less qualified it still makes sense to hire them to improve overall performance.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.5.1. Con: Diverse teams only work if the hires are relatively equal in skill. An under-qualified candidate brings down the rest of the group.
1.3.4.4.1.5.2.5.1.1. Con: This implies the diverse candidate will be under-qualified. If the candidate is actually qualified, the employee will turn out to be a useful hire for having disproved the stereotype.
1.3.4.4.1.5.3. Pro: The stigma that minorities need some kind of assistance to succeed is exacerbated by the use of affirmative action in college admissions.
1.3.4.4.1.5.3.1. Pro: The success of minorities in gaining college admissions is perceived as deriving from affirmative action rather than individual merit.
1.3.4.4.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Given that there is usually no clear way to identify which students are at college due to affirmative action, this stigma applies to all students belonging to that identity group.
1.3.4.4.1.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: [Even those](https://www.jstor.org/stable/257055?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) who are not affiliated with affirmative action will be stigmatized if they belong to the same race \(or in the study's case, gender\) as other affirmative action students.
1.3.4.4.1.5.3.2. Con: The point of affirmative action is to raise the education level of minorities to the point where they no longer need quotas to achieve proportional numbers in college. In this way it actually helps solve these negative stereotypes in the long term.
1.3.4.4.1.5.3.3. Con: When minorities face systematic structural barriers to their success that other members of society do not, they often do need assistance to succeed. The better approach is to destigmatise needing society to remove one's barriers to success, which normalising affirmative action helps to do.
1.3.4.4.1.6. Pro: Having access to higher incomes and higher status jobs increases the presence of minorities in privileged spaces such as wealthy suburbs, business lounges, golf clubs, high end retail stores, etc. This reduces the 'othering' effect of only encountering minorities in contexts that are associated with being lower class \(e.g. being a cashier\).
1.3.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.7.
1.3.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.11.1.7.4.
1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.5.1.
1.4. Con: -> See 1.3.2.11.1.
1.5. Pro: Affirmative action reinforces negative racial stigmas.
1.5.1. Pro: Knowing that some members of a minority group benefit from affirmative action casts aspersions on all members of that group.
1.5.2. Con: Negative racial stigmas arise around an oppressed group because of the oppression. For example, "this group is poor, therefore they are more likely to cheat or steal." Or "this group is has high unemployment, therefore they must be stupid". By promoting individuals from historically oppressed groups, affirmative action removes some of the imbalance and eventually weakens the associated stigma. "This student didn't have to cheat because they were getting preferential treatment".
1.5.3. Pro: Affirmative action is not compatible with the notion of [personal responsibility \(see p51\)](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Justice_Gender_and_Affirmative_Action.html?id=HyVQMWrdcxgC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) and accountability for success — things which should be learned for later life experiences.
1.5.4. Con: This is not a good reason to abolish affirmative action in general. Students placed through affirmative action are best placed to decide for themselves whether suffering some stigma during their degree is worth the lifelong benefit of higher education.
1.5.4.1. Con: This assumes that they are aware of the stigma that they are likely to face on campus as someone who benefits from affirmative action. Without having experienced it in the past, this is unlikely.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: Students attending due to affirmative action are probably used to experiencing stigma in spaces where they are a minority and assume the same thing would apply at college.
1.5.4.2. Con: This ignores the coercive pressure that is applied when they see a college spot up for grabs. For an individual from a disadvantaged background, this likely seems too good to pass on.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: This 'coercion' exists because college genuinely is a huge opportunity for some minorities. As coercion goes, it is very positively focused.
1.5.4.2.2. Con: It is not at all clear that stigmas are worse on college campuses than, for example, in the low-skill workplaces that are the majority of the opportunities available for high school graduates without a college degree.
1.5.4.3. Pro: While negative stigmas exist in colleges, the stigmas present in a college environment are likely to be less severe and impactful than those minorities experience in almost any other setting.
1.5.4.4. Pro: While regrettable, experiencing stigma in college is less important than the vast increases in job opportunities and lifetime earnings it confers.
1.5.4.5. Pro: Even if stigmas exist, individuals have different experiences of them and tolerances for their impacts. We should at least offer minorities the opportunity to pursue college and then decide on their own whether it is worth it.
1.5.5. Con: -> See 1.3.4.4.1.
1.5.6. Con: Society can work to readjust people's attitudes towards affirmative action more positively.
1.5.6.1. Con: Affirmative action has been a policy since 1961 and attitudes have yet to positively change. This makes it less promising that attitudes can or will change.
1.5.6.1.1. Con: Societies today are far less racist than they were when slavery existed. Social change does occur, but just takes time.
1.5.6.1.1.1. Con: [Seventy percent](http://time.com/4952612/race-relations-poll-charlottesville-donald-trump/) of Americans think the current state of race relations are bad. The fact that it is still a prominent and volatile topic today shows that society has not made substantial progress.
1.5.6.1.2. Pro: Public polls reveal only [45 percent](http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/11/18885926-nbc-newswsj-poll-affirmative-action-support-at-historic-low) of people support affirmative action policies today, in comparison to 61 percent of people in 1991.
1.5.6.2. Pro: Colleges often give prioritised entrance to the children of alumni who are typically the most well-off and in least need of special treatment. That this policy exists but is not as controversial as affirmative action suggests the way people view the 'meritocracy' of college admissions could be much improved.
1.5.6.3. Con: This would require broad public education programs that are beyond the means or scope of the individual colleges that determine whether or not to implement affirmative action.
1.5.6.4. Pro: Many policies targeting minorities are not accepted by majorities because they have no direct experience of racial discrimination. Better educational programs or shifts in media narratives could help build empathy for minorities and improve support for affirmative action and similar policies.
1.5.6.5. Pro: For example, [there exists speculation that Barack Obama attended Harvard as an affirmative action student](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/04/barack-obama-affirmative-actions-best-poster-child/237990/). If he were to confirm that, the standing of affirmative action would be improved.
1.5.7. Con: Often, minority students simply existing on campuses subverts the racist tropes that have historically applied to them.
1.5.7.1. Con: There is a history of [racism](http://college.usatoday.com/2016/02/26/racism-on-college-campuses-students-on-where-we-are-now/) on college campuses that is still present and being challenged today, in spite of increasing minority presence.
1.5.7.2. Pro: For example, [pervasive stereotypes about the intelligence of African American and Latino people](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/intelligence-and-the-stereotype-threat.html) still exist today. Seeing members of these groups represented in higher education helps to eradicate that perception.
1.5.7.3. Pro: Statistically speaking just having more minorities in a student body makes it more likely that some of them will visibly achieve academic excellence \(i.e. topping a class; receiving a Dean's prize; etc\).
1.5.7.3.1. Con: This is disingenuous, given it ignores the fact that affirmative action students are almost always at an academic disadvantage relative to their peers.
1.5.7.4. Pro: Having a critical mass of minority students better enables them to advocate for political causes and common interests without having to worry as much about being singled out.
1.5.7.4.1. Pro: On campuses with low diversity, minority students may not speak up for themselves for fear of being ostracized or ridiculed, without having a campus community to support them. Banding together allows them to support each other on-campus, minimizing the impact of any stigma they face.
1.5.7.4.1.1. Pro: It is easier to have minority student associations when there are more minority students on campus.
1.5.7.4.1.2. Con: Banding together does not absolve the presence of these negative stigmas.
1.5.7.4.1.2.1. Con: The purpose of banding together is for support against any negative stigmas, not to absolve the presence of them.
1.5.7.4.1.3. Pro: The existence of affirmative action demonstrates to minority students that their college, as an institution, cares about the issues facing minority students. This helps them combat negative stigma.
1.5.7.4.1.4. Con: The negative stigma associated with being a minority might actually lead to them distancing themselves from one another as they try to escape this stigma by associating with majority social groups.
1.5.7.4.1.5. Pro: Racial solidarity is important for mutual support and for [advocating for political change](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4500204?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) that improves the experience of being a minority.
1.5.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.3.
1.5.8. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.4.
1.5.9. Pro: The [high drop out rate](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-painful-truth-about-affirmative-action/263122/) and low educational attainment of many affirmative action students reinforces the idea that they are less equipped or intelligent than their peers.
1.5.9.1. Con: Not enough scientific research has been done on correlation between race and intelligence.
1.5.9.2. Con: These figures don’t reinforce that affirmative action students are less intelligent than their peers, but that they face more challenges.
1.5.9.2.1. Pro: 69% of Black Americans did not finish college [because of their high student loan debt](http://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html), while only 43% of white students listed this as a reason.
1.5.9.3. Con: Black students have [high graduation rates](http://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html) at US high-ranking colleges and universities. The Black graduation rate is actually higher than the white graduation rate at Wellesley, Bryn Mawr, Mount Holyoke, Colby College, and Swarthmore College.
1.5.10. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.4.1.5.3.
1.5.11. Con: -> See 1.5.7.4.1.
1.6. Con: Affirmative action in college admissions normalizes affirmative action in the workplace.
1.6.1. Con: Employers, as a requirement for staying in business, must hire the most qualified applicants they can. They would put their business at risk for hiring a lesser qualified candidate due to affirmative action.
1.6.1.1. Con: It is a myth that affirmative action leads to the hiring of unqualified workers as [Anthony Walesby](https://www.higheredjobs.com/Articles/articleDisplay.cfm?ID=246) explains.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Unless being of a certain race or gender relates to a workers ability to produce then selecting on race or gender will necessarily compromise more relevant selection criteria.
1.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Studies have shown selecting on race and gender \(i.e., diversity\) is [beneficial to employers and workers](https://blog.capterra.com/7-studies-that-prove-the-value-of-diversity-in-the-workplace/)
1.6.1.2. Con: Many companies have diversity programs. These [do not put their businesses at risk](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesmarketplace/2017/12/18/37-business-leaders-who-spoke-out-about-diversity-and-inclusion-in-2017/#5531eb0a15a0).
1.6.2. Con: This statement would be true if one believes that 'normalizes affirmative action' translates directly into the same employment opportunities as whites, but that, in itself, is a fallacy and a form of discrimination which is statistically indeterminable.
1.6.3. Pro: Where people have been exposed to affirmative action policies in college, they are more likely to accept and promote it in the workplace.
1.6.3.1. Con: The other way around, graduates might also be left with resentment towards Affirmative Action policies and oppose their implementation in other contexts.
1.6.4. Pro: Affirmative action policies are easier to implement in the workplace when there is a larger pool of qualified candidates from which to draw.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Tech companies like IBM and Intel are [active supporters](http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/09/pf/college/ibm-intel-dupont-affirmative-action/) of affirmative action in colleges because they want a larger pool of applicants and recognize that there is an uneven racial spread in their workforce, which is currently overwhelmingly white and male.
1.6.5. Con: The general poor academic performance of affirmative action students acts as a deterrent to businesses.
1.6.5.1. Con: While there is evidence of lower educational qualifications among minorities, this study found [no evidence](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/209930) of weaker job performance from affirmative action hires.
1.6.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.4.1.5.2.5.
1.6.5.3. Pro: [Educational requirements](http://www.nber.org/papers/w5603.pdf) are lower than for non-minorities.
1.6.5.3.1. Con: Affirmative Action counterbalances the historical conditions that led to educational disparity. Once the racial gap is successfully addressed, it will eventually become unnecessary.
1.6.5.3.2. Pro: Lower educational requirements for minority applicants may put them in a position of failing at a job because they are not as academically prepared for the tasks required.
1.6.5.3.3. Con: Affirmative action does not always have to come at the expense of quality. Improvements can be made such that only quality minority students are admitted/employed.
1.6.5.3.3.1. Con: This is already likely to occur without affirmative action as those candidates would likely be chosen anyway. Affirmative action is only beneficial on the margins when it is likely to lead to less qualified candidates.
1.6.5.3.4. Con: Even if educational requirements for minorities were lower, they still are vastly improved by having had a college education.
1.6.5.3.5. Con: -> See 1.6.5.1.
1.6.5.3.6. Con: This primarily suggests that colleges need to admit a greater number of minority students to meet demand from businesses, rather than that affirmative action policies are a problem.
1.6.6. Con: College and the workplace are not analogous so transferral is unlikely. At college, students are in effect customers paying the institution for a service. In the workplace, individuals are employees being paid for their own service.
1.6.7. Con: Explicit affirmative-action style hiring policies \(i.e. minority quotas for positions\) are extremely rare in private enterprise, even after decades of having affirmative action in college.
1.6.7.1. Pro: Only after a private company sells more than $50,000 in products or services to the federal government and employs at least 50 workers is it required to develop a written [affirmative action plan, or AAP](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/affirmative-action-handled-private-companies-72536.html).
1.6.7.1.1. Con: Those requirements can stigmatize the "minorities" already working at the workplace, putting them under special scrutiny, which could cause all kinds of friction.
1.6.8. Pro: College is nominally the final stage of training people undergo before entering their professional careers. To normalise affirmative action there is the closest it can get to being normalised in the workforce.
1.6.9. Pro: In the long-term, affirmative action helps create a more diverse workplace.
1.6.9.1. Pro: Many consider the diversity of a [company](https://www.glassdoor.com/press/twothirds-people-diversity-important-deciding-work-glassdoor-survey-2/) when deciding on a place to work. This gives companies with affirmative action policies a wider selection of qualified candidates from which to choose, increasing their opportunities to recruit top talent.
1.6.9.2. Pro: With more minorities getting college degrees, more of them will be able to access high-skill jobs.
1.6.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.
1.6.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.4.1.5.2.2.3.
1.7. Con: Affirmative action is important to the success of minorities in college.
1.7.1. Con: There are many social and academic organizations that exist in university that accept and help all people regardless of their race. It is more appropriate for the federal government to promote inclusive organizations rather than exclusive organizations at university.
1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.
1.7.3. Pro: Colleges have an incentive to maximise the success of affirmative action and scholarship students. The ways in which they achieve this \(e.g. increased student support resources\) benefit all disadvantaged students on campus.
1.7.3.1. Con: If colleges have an incentive to maximize the success of affirmative action students then they have an incentive for this to be done with increased student support resources solely for those students. This disadvantages all the other students, as there are fewer resources left for them.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Colleges often deploy their affirmative action policies as a way of enhancing their brand or their commitment to social justice. Thus they feel obligated to heavily support students who enter through affirmative action programs.
1.7.4. Pro: If affirmative action is stopped, it would suggest that it was always illegitimate and harm any students who entered through affirmative action but remained there after its abolition.
1.7.4.1. Con: This would only be a problem for a single generation. This is a weak reason to permanently continue an unfair system.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: This assumes that the problems that affirmative action seeks to redress would be solved in a single generation. Given the systemic levels of disadvantage faced, there is no reason to assume this is true.
1.7.4.2. Con: It's hard to identify whether specific individuals have been allowed entry due to affirmative action quotas.
1.7.4.2.1. Pro: If minority individuals do well in class, it is unlikely that their peers consider them to be enrolled due to an affirmative action program.
1.7.4.3. Con: Like with a sports scholarship given to a promising athlete - its withdrawal would not mean it was illegitimate to start with, only that the college policy changed or the circumstances of the athlete prevented them from continuing to enjoy the privileges they were previously afforded.
1.7.4.4. Con: It is also plausible that stopping affirmative action will not discredit its past implementation, but rather imply that progress has been made to the point where it is no longer needed for its intended purpose.
1.7.4.4.1. Pro: As America is becoming divided more by class and income than by race, [affirmative action](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/why-affirmative-action-no-longer-works/361113/) may not be as effective in helping the most underrepresented.
1.7.4.5. Pro: This is particularly a risk because of the existing undercurrent of belief in American society that affirmative action policies are illegitimate and their recipients are undeserving. It is through this lens that any such policy change would be interpreted.
1.7.5. Con: Affirmative action taints the academic success of all minorities as it creates the impression that they would not have gained admission to college on meritocratic grounds. Stopping affirmative action in the admissions process would restore legitimacy to all members of a minority group in the future.
1.7.5.1. Pro: Ability and hard work have made Barack and Michelle Obama, Condoleezza Rice, Oprah Winfrey and Colin Powell worthy role models. Affirmative action diminishes their achievements by giving the impression that they were assisted to reach those heights.
1.7.5.1.1. Con: The success of a few celebrities masks the reality that it is very difficult for underrepresented minorities to succeed. They are not representative of the lives of most minorities.
1.7.5.1.2. Con: There is no way of ascertaining whether these people were admitted to college on their own merit or as beneficiaries of affirmative action.
1.7.5.1.2.1. Pro: If an employer has two candidates for employment, one Asian, one Black, knowing that the Asian candidate is held to a much higher bar in college than the Black candidate is, the inclination could be to choose the former first.
1.7.5.1.3. Con: Having achieved these positions, their worth is determined by their actions not whether they achieved the position from affirmative action. It is not true to suggest that they would have been respected any differently without affirmative action.
1.7.5.1.3.1. Con: In the case of former US President Obama, it was very much a topic of discussion: Donald Trump often accused Obama of being a [terrible student](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Trump-Obama-Wasnt-Good-Enough-to-Get-into-Ivy-Schools-120657869.html%3Famp%3Dy?client=safari) who only got his Harvard place because of affirmative action.
1.7.5.1.3.1.1. Con: Trump has also accused Obama, variously, of [not being born in the US](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/politics/donald-trump-obama-birther.html) \(despite substantial evidence to the contrary\), [wiretapping him](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-updates-everything-president-trump-accuses-obama-of-wiretapping-1488648248-htmlstory.html) \(despite no evidence thereof\), and, particularly bizarrely, [colluding with Russia](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/donald-trump-barack-obama-russia-tweets-election-hacking-fbi-badly-exposed-a7809616.html). It is difficult to treat any particular accusation he levels as either grounded in genuine belief or reality, as such, this is not an indicative example.
1.7.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.7.5.3. Con: Affirmative action policies have been in place in US colleges since the 1960s, yet this does not appear to have occurred.
1.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.7.4.
1.7.7. Pro: Affirmative action students may be especially motivated to succeed academically after having been given such an important opportunity.
1.7.7.1. Con: Black and Hispanic male college students may have [higher motivations](https://news.utexas.edu/2014/03/17/cccse-report-aspirations-to-achievement) to do well academically than their white peers, but this does not typically translate into academic success.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.
1.9. Pro: Affirmative action promotes reverse discrimination.
1.9.1. Pro: Some white people believe that anti-white racism [is now a bigger problem](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691611406922) than anti-black racism. These beliefs are likely to be triggered by affirmative action policies.
1.9.1.1. Con: Despite people's perceptions, anti-white racism is not actually a bigger problem than anti-Black racism.
1.9.1.1.1. Pro: Racism is a hierarchal system of oppression based on phenotypes where 'White Europe' is superior and 'Black Africa' is inferior. The hierarchy determines resource access, public perception and treatment. It was created by Europeans to justify perpetual exploitation of Africa and its global majority 'melanated' population for the benefit of a 'white minority appearance.' As a white creation for white benefit, white people cannot be victims of racism.
1.9.1.1.2. Pro: Black people are incarcerated at [nearly six times the rate](http://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/) of white people.
1.9.1.1.2.1. Con: This is not an argument relevant to whether anti-white or anti-black racism is worse.
1.9.1.1.2.1.1. Con: That there is such a huge imbalance in policing between races speaks to either the effects of active discrimination or  structural disadvantage against Black Americans. Either way anti-black racism is worse given it exacerbates this already dire situation.
1.9.1.1.3. Pro: Black school students are suspended and expelled at [3 times the rate](http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/01/28/us-education-still-separate-and-unequal) of white students.
1.9.1.1.4. Pro: Black people are disproportionately subject to targeting by law enforcement \(e.g. [stop and frisk](https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-racial-discrimination)\).
1.9.1.1.5. Pro: A survey found that [51% of Americans](https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-racial-discrimination) harbor anti-Black sentiments.
1.9.1.1.6. Pro: A policy that tangibly helps minorities should not be discontinued because of mistaken beliefs.
1.9.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.4.2.1.
1.9.1.3. Con: This could be used as a justification for removing any policy which protects a minority. Often, these policies effectively harm the majority but we still promote them because one of the purposes of the US political system is to [protect minority interests](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm).
1.9.1.4. Pro: Even if whites are mistaken in their belief that anti-white racism is important, it is better to pursue non-targeted policies \(such as universal basic income\) that enhance life for minorities but do not prompt backlash from majority groups that control most political and financial power.
1.9.1.5. Pro: Given that whites with college degrees make up most of the political and business elite it makes sense that they might be especially offended by policies like affirmative action that directly relate to their own life experiences. Given this, it is probably better to expend political capital on policies that enhance the lives of minorities without triggering this particular form of backlash.
1.9.1.5.1. Con: Policies that do not trigger backlash are likely to be ones which benefit all people equally. Even if these improve everyone's life, they do not correct for relative inequality between groups.
1.9.1.5.1.1. Con: Relative inequalities are less important to people's wellbeing and their absolute standard of living. Even policies that distribute financial resources or education to everyone still have the largest impact on those who had the least resources/education in the first place.
1.9.1.5.1.2. Pro: In fact, because wealthier groups in society have more political capital and likely more choice in how they spend additional funds, they often benefit most from seemingly equal policies.
1.9.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: For example, when the Australian government rolled out the 'Building the Education Revolution' stimulus package \(which gave additional funding to all schools\), [private schools benefitted disproportionately](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/schools-the-pawns-in-a-grand-plan-20100607-xqmz.html).
1.9.2. Con: Affirmative action does not give minorities a leg up; it just levels a playing field that is systemically unequal.
1.9.2.1. Con: Race is a single component of privilege. If you want to level the playing field, we should level all parts that affect the field such as parenting, peer groups, and socioeconomic level, height, attractiveness, etc.
1.9.2.2. Pro: Affirmative action helps redress the ongoing effects of racial injustices.
1.9.2.2.1. Pro: In the 1930s and 1940s, the U.S. government helped many White Americans gain skills and wealth while largely [ignoring Black Americans](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/books/review/when-affirmative-action-was-white-uncivil-rights.html).
1.9.2.2.1.1. Pro: During this time, most Black Americans worked as agricultural labor or domestic workers and both of those occupations were excluded from [minimum wage, Social Security, unemployment insurance and workmen's compensation](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/books/review/when-affirmative-action-was-white-uncivil-rights.html).
1.9.2.2.1.2. Pro: Although the G.I. Bill was intended to help all veterans, Black Veterans North and South were excluded.
1.9.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: Local [white officials](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/books/review/when-affirmative-action-was-white-uncivil-rights.html) denied housing and business loans to Black Veterans as well as admission to all-white colleges and universities.
1.9.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: [By October 1946](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/books/review/when-affirmative-action-was-white-uncivil-rights.html), 6,500 former soldiers had been placed in nonfarm jobs by the employment service in Mississippi; 86 percent of the skilled and semiskilled jobs were filled by whites, 92 percent of the unskilled ones by blacks.
1.9.2.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: [In New York and northern New Jersey](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/books/review/when-affirmative-action-was-white-uncivil-rights.html), fewer than 100 of the 67,000 mortgages insured by the G.I. Bill supported home purchases by nonwhites.
1.9.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: Black veterans were also excluded from job-training programs for careers in promising new fields like radio and electrical work, commercial photography, and mechanics. Instead, most African-Americans were channeled toward traditional, low-paying ["black jobs."](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/books/review/when-affirmative-action-was-white-uncivil-rights.html)
1.9.2.2.2. Con: Affirmative action ignores the real socio-economic reasons behind less success in school. Issues like fatherlessness and lack of reproductive responsibility.
1.9.2.2.3. Con: Ongoing effects of racial injustice will not be redressed by unjustly affecting people based on their race.
1.9.2.2.3.1. Con: The affecting of people based on their race is not unjust, it is to alleviate the inequalities caused by systematic racism.
1.9.2.2.4. Con: Affirmative action does not help solve any particular racial injustices that already exist; it just adds more in the opposite direction to make the statistics look like previous problems were fixed.
1.9.2.2.5. Con: Those disadvantaged by affirmative actions had no part in the discriminatory policies of the \(far off\) past.
1.9.2.2.6. Pro: Black Americans are disproportionately poor. Affirmative action helps alleviate this income disparity.
1.9.2.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.4.1.1.
1.9.2.2.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.9.2.
1.9.2.2.6.3. Pro: Black Americans have the highest [poverty](http://stateofworkingamerica.org/fact-sheets/poverty/) rate at 27.4 percent, in comparison to white Americans at 9.9 percent.
1.9.2.2.7. Pro: Affirmative action policies create leaders within minority communities.
1.9.2.2.7.1. Pro: Historically, civil rights leaders have been college educated.
1.9.2.2.7.1.1. Pro: Martin Luther King Jr. [had a PhD](http://drmartinlutherking.net/martin-luther-king-education).
1.9.2.2.7.2. Pro: There is a stronger culture of activism on college campuses than there is in society as a whole.
1.9.2.2.7.3. Pro: In addition to academic excellence, many colleges and universities are focused on [cultivating leadership](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/01/why-are-american-colleges-obsessed-with-leadership/283253/) qualities in its students. Affirmative action policies give minority students better access to these institutions, thus increasing the chance for them to become leaders.
1.9.2.2.7.4. Pro: A college education increases the chance that someone will have the financial stability to devote time to activism or civil rights work.
1.9.2.2.7.5. Pro: A college education increases the chance that someone will be able to access the advanced training needed to, for example, work as a civil rights lawyer.
1.9.2.2.8. Pro: Black Americans have historically been, and are to this day, [locked out of housing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/07/03/why-we-still-need-affirmative-action-for-african-americans-in-college-admissions/?utm_term=.2ccf40f760d5) that gives access to good public schooling. This creates a form of de-facto [segregation](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/19/america-schools-segregation-race-class-education-policy-bobby-scott) in school.
1.9.2.2.8.1. Pro: Without access to good public schooling, it is harder to gain entrance to college without any form of affirmative action.
1.9.2.2.8.2. Pro: This is in tension with the decision in [Brown v. The Board of Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education), which legally mandated the de-segregation of American schools.
1.9.2.2.8.2.1. Con: As long as admissions are based on empirical academic standards and not excluding people based on demographics, then it is not racial segregation and is therefore in keeping with Brown V. The Board of Education jurisprudence.
1.9.2.2.9. Pro: Native Americans have had their land stolen and desecrated by the State. This creates an obligation on white Americans to look after native people.
1.9.2.2.10. Con: Affirmative action only admits minorities in such a limited fashion that their attitudes and outlooks are assimilated into those of the majority rather than threatening any real cultural shift. In doing so it allows colleges to appear progressive without threatening the privilege of their students or of the institution.
1.9.2.2.10.1. Con: Even if affirmative action only admits minorities in a limited fashion, it is still more than it would be without affirmative action.
1.9.2.2.10.2. Con: Many minorities bond together on the basis of their identity and do not assimilate into the majority.
1.9.2.2.10.3. Pro: Given that affirmative action policies still use the same metrics as normal college admissions, only applied to a limited pool of applicants, the people who get accepted are likely to be the most acceptable, and therefore least controversial, to the admissions team.
1.9.2.2.10.4. Con: This is an argument for deeper affirmative action programs, not stopping affirmative action policies altogether.
1.9.2.2.11. Con: This is a very limited form of redress, and one which uses political capital that could be better allocated to the advocation of policies like [reparations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reparations_for_slavery).
1.9.2.2.11.1. Con: Affirmative action is a better long term solution for these groups as it empowers the community in the long run as opposed to short term injections of resources.
1.9.2.2.11.2. Con: Affirmative action sets up a political mood that makes policies like reparations more acceptable.
1.9.2.2.11.2.1. Pro: When policies like affirmative action are passed, experts and academics talk about the need to address historical/racial injustices as justification for these policies.
1.9.2.2.11.2.1.1. Pro: As more of this literature comes out, popular news organizations and journalists cover this research. Then, mainstream society learns about these issues and becomes more sympathetic towards these sorts of policies.
1.9.2.2.11.2.1.2. Con: This is an extremely optimistic view of how these stories get covered. In reality, the mainstream media is more likely to cover stories such as [these](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30462129/ns/us_news-life/t/does-affirmative-action-punish-whites/#.WIlaTbZ97iw), which emphasise the 'reverse discrimination' angle.
1.9.2.2.11.2.1.2.1. Pro: Even liberal news outlets, like [the Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-painful-truth-about-affirmative-action/263122/) and the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/07/17/a-basic-flaw-in-the-argument-against-affirmative-action/?utm_term=.46c7b21a320a), are increasingly giving affirmative action negative coverage.
1.9.2.2.11.3. Con: Affirmative action empowers disenfranchised minorities and makes it easier for them to exercise their political power.
1.9.2.2.11.3.1. Pro: Those who have college degrees are [much more likely to vote.](http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/demographics)
1.9.2.2.11.3.1.1. Pro: These affirmative action beneficiaries are much more likely to vote in favor of policies that serve their community's interest \(e.g. Reparations\).
1.9.2.2.11.4. Con: Because the policy is status quo, it does not require much additional political capital to maintain it.
1.9.2.2.11.4.1. Con: However, by removing the policy, it might effectively free up political capital to use elsewhere.
1.9.2.2.11.5. Con: A US Supreme Court amicus [brief](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=105078117027005082019086093094087064062064049034070049097093096111068117061060030062062026016087108072065028098112075023076013124000124069117100115106094092062078001120104122029025090091069123089096023015118123095083025010083112097090098001004&EXT=pdf) defends affirmative action as being considered reparations for slavery and legal discrimination.
1.9.2.2.11.6. Con: Affirmative action is vastly more politically tenable than reparations.
1.9.2.2.11.6.1. Pro: Affirmative action is a policy that currently exists. Getting rid of a sure thing for the possibility of reparations is far too risky.
1.9.2.2.11.6.2. Pro: Reparations will cause social upheaval also by depriving minorities who benefit from affirmative action today - excluding them because their ancestors were not enslaved or because they settled in the country after the achievements of the civil rights movement in the 1960s.
1.9.2.2.11.7. Pro: These policies would be more helpful for the most disenfranchised within these minorities.
1.9.2.2.11.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.6.
1.9.2.2.11.8. Con: Affirmative action directly addresses and improves the educational inequalities experienced by minorities, something reparations does not provide.
1.9.2.2.11.9. Pro: Reparations can raise the socioeconomic level of Black Americans, making it easier for them to afford better education and thus, a better academic outcome.
1.9.2.2.12. Con: Affirmative action does not serve to redress the effects of racial injustices in the past. Asian Americans have been [historically discriminated](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/06/19/the-rise-of-asian-americans/) against, but they do not benefit from affirmative action.
1.9.2.2.12.1. Con: The U.S. Supreme Court recognized that Asian Americans or whites [may benefit](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/opinion-affirmative-action-asian-americans-are-not-your-wedge-n610596) from affirmative action policies.
1.9.2.2.12.1.1. Con: The article cited mentions benefits for neither Asians nor whites. On the other hand, its argument that Affirmative Action policies do not impact Asian Americans negatively is based on misinterpretation of evidence.
1.9.2.2.12.2. Pro: Many elite colleges [control the racial composition](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/opinion/white-students-unfair-advantage-in-admissions.html?_r=0) of their classes through affirmative action regulations. These regulations often lead to an illegitimate preference for whites over Asian-Americans.
1.9.2.2.12.2.1. Con: Just because some schools illegitimately preference whites over Asian-Americans does not mean that all colleges should stop affirmative action. It simply means that colleges should stop unfairly prioritizing whites over Asian-Americans.
1.9.2.2.12.2.2. Con: Asian Americans have been [among the greatest direct beneficiaries](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/opinion-affirmative-action-asian-americans-are-not-your-wedge-n610596) of various affirmative action programs. Various elite colleges, such as Yale, include Asian Americans in their race conscious admission criteria.
1.9.2.2.12.2.2.1. Con: Asian Americans tend to support affirmative action policies not because they benefit them, but because the areas where they tend to congregate are major urban centers, where the majority of voters tend to vote progressive.
1.9.2.2.12.2.2.2. Con: The idea that affirmative action still benefits Asian Americans doesn't account for how low Asian admission rates are, in addition to having the highest mean GPAs and standardized test scores.
1.9.2.2.12.2.2.2.1. Pro: Harvard consistently rates Asian-American applicants low in ['personality traits'](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/harvard-asian-enrollment-applicants.html), affecting their admission despite higher test scores.
1.9.2.2.12.2.3. Pro: Colleges that enforce affirmative action policies tend to have a majority of their places [reserved](http://hlrecord.org/2012/10/affirmative-action-benefits-white-people/) for whites. Colleges that don’t enforce affirmative action policies have a smaller percentage of white students, as for example [Berkley 24%](http://opa.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-fall-enrollment-data), [Stuyvesant High 24%](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/education/black-at-stuyvesant-high-one-girls-experience.html?pagewanted=all), or [Caltech 29%](https://www.registrar.caltech.edu/academics/enrollment).
1.9.2.2.12.2.3.1. Con: These numbers are misleading as they only talk about the percentage of white students and not about the composition of the rest of the student body. In Stuyvesant High, for example, the number of Blacks and Hispanics [is almost minimal and falling](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/12/nyregion/status-quo-at-elite-new-york-schools-few-blacks-and-hispanics.html). Only seven black and 21 Hispanic students got admitted in 2014 with a total enrollment of about 3,300.
1.9.2.2.12.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.7.3.
1.9.2.2.12.2.5. Con: Asian Americans are not a disadvantaged minority group in this particular context; they [have the highest level of educational achievement and the highest level of average earnings amongst any racial group](http://blogs.voanews.com/all-about-america/2016/04/11/why-asian-americans-are-the-most-educated-group-in-america/), including white Americans.
1.9.2.2.12.2.5.1. Con: The perception of Asian-Americans as a ‘privileged minority’ [disregards](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bernadette-lim/being-asianamerican-in-th_b_7295246.html) internal class differences between Asian-American sub-groups.
1.9.2.2.12.2.5.1.1. Pro: This stereotype also negatively affects Southeast Asians who traditionally have a harder time achieving academic success because of their [typically less privileged backgrounds](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bernadette-lim/being-asianamerican-in-th_b_7295246.html).
1.9.2.2.12.2.5.1.2. Con: This is an argument for more granular policies, that separate out such diverse groups into more, smaller groups.
1.9.2.2.12.3. Con: This policy helps redress past racial injustices against at least some communities. It should not be ended just because its redress is restricted to some communities.
1.9.2.2.12.4. Con: -> See 1.9.2.2.10.4.
1.9.2.2.13. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.4.1.5.2.4.
1.9.2.3. Pro: White individuals [have systemic advantages](https://changefromwithin.org/2012/06/06/are-white-students-being-disadvantaged-by-affirmative-action/) in the current admissions system.
1.9.2.3.1. Con: That article talks about being better prepared due to having more resources. The advantage is not directly due to being white.
1.9.2.4. Pro: Minorities are disproportionately located in poor income neighborhoods with lower quality of schooling.
1.9.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.2.8.
1.9.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.7.7.2.5.2.
1.9.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.4.
1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.4.2.1.
1.9.4. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.5.
1.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.4.3.
1.9.6. Pro: Reverse discrimination is a valid issue in that it highlights how broad metrics fail to equitably determine who best deserves assistance. In the case of affirmative action, it exposes the flawed assumption that all members of a minority group are as disadvantaged as the most disadvantaged members of the majority group; an assumption that ignores intersectional attributes such as class, sexuality, gender, etc.
1.9.6.1. Con: Dealing with the fact that, in general, white people are more advantaged than otherwise equivalent people of colour does not require that we ignore other facets of disadvantage.
1.9.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.7.
1.9.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.6.
1.9.6.4. Pro: Members of a majority racial group often had to overcome at least some adversity in order to attend college, such as having grown up poor, been marginalised for their sexuality, or having a physical or mental impairment. When they see minorities being given automatic entry to college they feel like society only recognises disprivilege when it stems from race.
1.9.6.4.1. Con: This would presumably be better dealt with by doing a better job acknowledging and correcting for a greater variety of disadvantages, rather than stopping correcting for disadvantages attached to one's race.
1.9.6.5. Pro: Both reverse discrimination and intersectional analyses point to the problems in making assumptions about privilege through a single lens.  Although these critiques are made by different groups they would both probably agree that it were better if college entry used a more holistic calculation to determine who is in most need of equitable access.
1.9.6.6. Con: To the extent to which these issues exist, they are still not problems of discrimination - but rather of a failure to provide targeted help to other disadvantaged groups, such as LGBT people or women.
1.9.6.6.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.6.1.1.
1.10. Con: -> See 1.9.2.2.
1.11. Con: Affirmative action is important to the success of minorities later in life.
1.11.1. Con: Affirmative action is not the only avenue to give minorities access to success. There are [many](http://www.mspg.org/resources/78-diversity-civil-rights-organizations) organizations dedicated to this.
1.11.1.1. Pro: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \([NAACP](http://www.naacp.org/issues/economic-opportunity/)\) has programs, scholarships, and initiatives to help students receive the education and economic opportunities necessary for future success.
1.11.2. Con: Affirmative action quotas have begun to have a [negative effect on chances of admission](http://www.collegeconfidential.com/dean/should-we-check-the-asian-box-on-applications/) for some subsets of minorities.
1.11.2.1. Con: If a school is not willing to take in more worthy students of a certain ethnicity than they have to, this is a clear symptom of racism.
1.11.3. Con: Affirmative action does not help fix the culture within minority communities, nor does it help fix the culture regarding minorities within diverse communities.
1.11.4. Con: The presumption that preferential treatment in university acceptance is important to the success of one racial group is an example of racist and patronizing thought. The statement requires that one implicitly believe that without preferential treatment, members of the race in question could not achieve success later in life.
1.11.5. Con: This is making a generalization \(assumption\) based on the group \(race/ethnicity\) of the person. If their group suffers, then it's better to target those people suffering, rather than assume all in the group suffer the same.
1.11.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.2.4.
1.11.7. Pro: College degrees often have greater [social value](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED521322.pdf) for people of marginalized racial or socioeconomic backgrounds. Affirmative action policies makes obtaining a degree more possible for these groups.
1.11.7.1. Pro: Education is critical in [alleviating inter-generational poverty](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/struggle-street-education-is-the-key-to-breaking-intergenerational-poverty-20150506-ggvya3.html).
1.11.7.2. Pro: Having more minorities with college degrees normalises this within their communities and makes pursuing higher education seem like a more achievable aspiration.
1.11.7.3. Pro: Having parents with college degrees has a significant positive effect on the [educational and occupational prospects of their children](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2853053/).
1.11.8. Pro: By having affirmative action policies, minorities are more likely to be represented in government.
1.11.8.1. Con: Minority groups such as Asian-Americans haven not translated their high representation in institutions of focus in affirmative action policies \(i.e. university education, high paying employment\) into political representation.
1.11.8.2. Pro: [Only 5.2%](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43869.pdf) of people elected to US Congress in 2016 did not have at least a bachelor's degree. Reducing the population of minority students in college is likely to lead to a lower representation of these groups in Congress.
1.11.8.3. Pro: A greater diversity in Congress allows for better policies to be formed as they can draw upon the actual experience of members in forming them.
1.11.8.3.1. Con: The fact that someone belongs to a minority group doesn't necessarily make them well positioned to advocate for their interests.
1.11.8.3.1.1. Pro: [Less than 20%](http://www.jbhe.com/news_views/64_degrees.html) of Black Americans have bachelors degrees, so those who do aren't necessarily representative of the community or its interests.
1.11.8.3.1.1.1. Con: The segregation between Black and white people goes beyond money and college education. Even if Black Americans receive a good income, they often [end up](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/us/milwaukee-segregation-wealthy-black-families.html?_r=0) living in poor communities anyway.
1.11.8.3.1.2. Pro: Minority candidates often get hamstrung by [respectability politics](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/12/respectability-politics-wont-save-black-americans), which forces them to be moderate in the policies they push.
1.11.8.3.1.2.1. Pro: For example, Obama is often [criticised](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/paradox-of-the-first-black-president.html) for being relatively weak on policies that specifically target Black American interests.
1.11.8.3.1.2.2. Con: Even if they aren't the ones advocating these policies, minority candidates can add valuable insight and perspective on issues which affect them.
1.11.8.3.1.2.3. Con: Respectability politics is in part driven by the internalised racism of voters causing them to overpunish minority politicians. The more they are exposed to minorities generally and minority politicians specifically, the more that process is broken down, freeing minority politicians to take more aggressive policy positions.
1.11.8.3.1.3. Con: The presence of minorities in government is symbolically significant in and of itself.
1.11.8.3.1.4. Con: By this logic, a government dominated by white men would be no worse than a government which actually mirrored demographics. However, this would \(and historically did\) lead to racist and sexist policies.
1.11.8.4. Con: There is no reason that a college education should be a prerequisite for democratic participation, even at the highest level.
1.11.8.4.1. Con: Regardless of whether or not there is a reason why it should be like this, empirically it is true that it is very difficult to become a politician at the highest level without a college degree.
1.11.8.4.2. Con: While a college degree is not a prerequisite for democratic participation per se, the network of friends, colleagues, former professors and workmates one receives attending college is an advantage that shouldn't be underestimated.
1.11.8.5. Con: The backlash to affirmative action policies, and the resultant racism, makes it less politically viable to elect minority candidates.
1.11.8.6. Pro: A more diverse minority representation in government increases [voter participation](http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/R_601CGR.pdf) among these groups, resulting in policies that have a direct positive effect on their communities.
1.11.9. Pro: Having more members of minorities with a college education normalises that aspiration within their communities and thus creates a virtuous cycle of increasing college attendance.
1.11.9.1. Con: Having success by merit alone is an even better role model.
1.11.10. Con: -> See 1.3.2.
1.12. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.4.1.5.2.
1.13. Pro: In principle, the government should not endorse policies that treat people differently based on their race.
1.13.1. Pro: Affirmative action is no longer needed because it's already illegal to deny services based on race, gender/sexual orientation, personal/political beliefs etc.
1.13.2. Pro: However a human tries, selection criteria will always be biased. AI algorithms could provide a neutral solution based on tangible factors but this is currently unreachable, both technologicaly and moraly.
1.13.3. Con: Affirmative action is not necessesarily the purview of just the government; if it is useful private organizations are under moral obligation to enact it.
1.13.4. Pro: The defense of affirmative action competes for the power of progressives to make more subtiantive and effective changes to the more important social structures that maintain inequality.
1.13.5. Con: It is principally justified for governments to acknowledge differences which cause structural barriers for minority groups.
1.13.5.1. Pro: It's important to consider the wealth gap between whites and non-whites in America.   White people have 16 times more wealth than non-whites, according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2015/03/26/the-racial-wealth-gap-why-a-typical-white-household-has-16-times-the-wealth-of-a-black-one/&refURL=&referrer=#3119395b1f45).  Wealth includes material and non-material assets.  In addition, white people can turn every dollar they earn in to 3 times more wealth than non-whites.  So the playing field is far from level and we have a responsibility to try to correct that.
1.13.5.2. Con: Fighting discrimination with other forms of discrimination is only going to magnify the problem.
1.13.5.2.1. Con: The Supreme Court ruled in [Paradise v. Allen](http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3689) that even potentially "discriminatory" measures used to address historical racial disparities are reasonable
1.13.5.2.2. Con: A problem which affects a group can't be fixed by solutions that are blind to such groups - indiscriminate solutions aren't viable because they inherently ignore the problem.
1.13.5.3. Pro: For example, paid maternity leave policies single out women, because they are more likely to be put in a position where they are pressured to leave work after having a child.
1.13.5.4. Pro: ['Race blindness'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_color_blindness) only perpetuates discrimination.
1.13.5.4.1. Con: 'Color blindness' was a fundamental tenant of the Civil Rights Movement of the 50s and 60s, which has greatly reduced discrimination.
1.13.5.4.2. Pro: Color-blind admissions would favor white students because of their earlier educational advantages.
1.13.5.4.2.1. Pro: Elements that enhance the chances of a college applicant - such as social background, parental education, life experience and extra-curricular interests - are weighted in favor of white applicants.
1.13.5.4.2.2. Pro: [A long-term analysis of SAT scores](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/10/27/study-finds-race-growing-explanatory-factor-sat-scores-california) shows that race and ethnicity among applicants to the University of California campuses are a stronger predictor of SAT scores than income or the education level of parents.
1.13.5.4.2.3. Pro: There exists [a huge segregation](http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-345) by race and class in primary and secondary public schools. High-poverty, high-minority schools are under-resourced and over-disciplined.
1.13.5.4.2.4. Pro: In 2012, 15 % of African-American students attended ‘[apartheid schools](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/even-after-neighborhoods-integrate-many-students-attend-apartheid-schools/432435/)’, a term used to describe schools in which at least 99% of students are black.
1.13.6. Con: Many laws that are implemented by the government are designed to target certain groups within society \(based on socio-economic status, geography\). It is unclear why policies that treat people differently based on these mutable characteristics are principally any different to race.
1.13.6.1. Con: Race isn't mutable.
1.13.7. Pro: Under the [Equal Protection Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause#Text) of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution, affirmative action may be considered unconstitutional, because it favors one group over another group based on racial preference.
1.13.7.1. Con: Laws like [Title IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX) are considered constitutional, even though they allow for specific protection of a minority group \(in this case women\) in a way which may seem discriminatory at face value.
1.13.7.1.1. Con: [Title 9](http://claremontindependent.com/title-ix-sexual-violence-the-preponderance-standard/) in itself is very controversial and should be repealed. Under the Obama administration, Title 9 has been interpreted to mean that colleges are forced to have separate pseudo courts for sexual assault cases where the burden of proof is changed from beyond a reasonable doubt to preponderance of evidence.
1.13.7.2. Con: The US Supreme Court recently [upheld the constitutionality of affirmative action](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/us/politics/supreme-court-affirmative-action-university-of-texas.html).
1.13.7.2.1. Con: The source shows that the court upheld a single incident of affirmative action, instead accepting that race was a valid consideration when giving out college places. It was also a narrow 4-3 victory, and specifically does not protect the constitutionality of other affirmative action programs.
1.13.7.2.2. Pro: The idea that 'reverse discrimination' goes against American principles and values is at least somewhat undermined when the highest experts on the constitution decide that it should be permitted.
1.13.7.2.3. Pro: Over time the US Supreme Court has issued many rulings that have identified many policies — segregation, miscegeny bans, and housing limitations, etc — as discriminatory to the point of being illegal. That they did not find Affirmative Action to be the same shows that its form of 'discrimination' is not harmful.
1.13.7.2.4. Con: Many policies or activities may be harmful even if they are legal according to the Constitution.
1.13.7.2.5. Pro: It is important to note that this case, and others in the precedent chain before it, have dealt directly with whether affirmative action programs are discriminatory - as if they are, state universities would be in breach of constitutional guarantees of equal treatment - and found them not to be.
1.13.8. Pro: [Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1866) prohibits discrimination of a group of people based on race, nationality, or color. Affirmative action violates this by denying admission to white applicants in favor of minority applicants.
1.13.8.1. Con: Affirmative action does not deny white students access; schools do that by having caps on the number of students they admit. Affirmative action ensures minorities who would be discriminated against get the same chance.
1.13.8.2. Con: This presupposes that affirmative action equates to discrimination, rather than a remedy to it.
1.13.8.2.1. Con: Affirmative action is discrimination - it actively discriminates \(to choose between\) people on the basis of race. It further validates race as a measure of value and judgement to be excercised upon people.
1.13.8.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.2.
1.13.8.3. Con: It is perverse to interpret these laws in a way which victimises the very group of people they were intended to protect.
1.13.8.4. Con: Not implementing affirmative action would be denying minority applicants a fair opportunity: they go to college at disproportionately lower rates because the system is rigged against them.
1.13.8.5. Pro: White applicants need higher grades and standardized test scores than Black applicants to be offered admission.
1.13.8.6. Con: -> See 1.13.7.2.
1.13.9. Con: -> See 1.13.7.2.
1.13.10. Con: Governments have an obligation to correct for structural inequalities which arise from state discrimination.
1.13.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.2.1.
1.13.10.2. Con: Affirmative action is not the only way nor the best way to correct for structural inequalitity.
1.13.10.3. Con: The term "structural" implies that there's something fundamental in the system that causes discrimination to arise. The very existence of affirmative action is the proof that such systemic discrimination doesn't exist, a large group like a nation or a society can either discriminate or not.
1.13.10.3.1. Con: A large group like a nation or society is extremely multifaceted and can both structurally discriminate as well as try to correct structural inequalities at the same time .
1.13.10.3.2. Con: Structural discrimination can be a pervasive part of society and something that is extremely difficult to solve. In contrast, specific policies like affirmative action are much more achievable as they can be implemented by relatively small groups; thus they can exist even in the face of larger structural issues.
1.13.10.4. Con: The only structured, systemic racism that exists within our government is, in fact, Affirmative Action policies that provide preferential treatment based solely on race.
1.13.10.5. Con: The US government has an obligation to democratically represent the will of its citizens, any obligation to correct for structural inequalities is contingent.
1.13.10.6. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.2.8.
1.13.11. Con: Equal treatment is not necessarily fair treatment.
1.13.11.1. Con: The opposition of equality to fairness is one that is fraught with dangers. The claim implicitly supposes fairness to be a higher goal than equality, but the opposite is true. Equal treatment of individuals is the high water mark of open societies; when we go further and attempt to make outcomes "fair" \(Marxism, authoritarian socialism, etc\) we find we can only do so by ceding autonomy and agency to authorities as arbiters of fairness.
1.13.11.2. Con: Treating people equally is equitable.
1.13.11.2.1. Pro: The definition of equitable is fair and impartial. Treating people equally is being impartial, whereas treating them unequally would be biased.
1.13.11.2.1.1. Pro: To be fair, affirmative action policies would have to include disadvantaged students from every race, not just minorities. Since it is not structured this way, it cannot be equitable.
1.13.11.2.1.2. Con: Impartiality does not require that one be blind to circumstance. For example, where one house in a block is on fire, impartiality would not require that firefighters spread water equally over all houses in the area, rather than focusing on the only one in need.
1.13.11.2.2. Con: Treating everyone equally is only equitable if everyone starts from the same place. Thus, differences and privileges have to be acknowledged to be able to treat people equitable.
1.13.11.3. Pro: Treating everyone the same ignores historical and structural factors that make some people uniquely vulnerable based on their identity \(e.g. race/class/gender\).
1.13.11.4. Pro: Treating everyone equally \(i.e. the same\) entrenches dominant norms and values, which normally reflect only the priorities of the dominant, privileged groups within society.
1.13.11.5. Pro: Many policies that are broadly accepted to protect equal rights in society \(e.g. maternity leave\) are 'unequal' in their scope or application.
1.13.12. Pro: Government policy that affects minorities \(i.e. welfare, affirmative action\) would be more popular and better resourced if it targeted the effects of discrimination \(poverty, lack of education\) than if it explicitly targeted race.
1.13.12.1. Con: Policies that would redirect enough resources to make a significant impact on issues like poverty and education would be costly and prompt backlash from tax payers as well. A system that enables minorities to become economically productive means less backlash as less resources and money are taken from other economically productive citizens.
1.13.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.1.5.
