Discussion Title: Should Steroid Use in Sports Be Allowed?

1. Steroid Use in Sports Should Be Allowed.
1.1. Pro: Legalising steroid use in sports will level the playing field.
1.1.1. Con: Legalising steroids would force all athletes to take steroids if they wanted to remain competitive.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Athletes often sacrifice a great deal to achieve professional status, and may not easily be able to transition out of sports and into another career. That makes this choice incredibly coercive.
1.1.1.2. Pro: If using PEDs becomes normalised, the drive to win, or coercion from others, could [motivate](https://law.marquette.edu/facultyblog/2010/10/20/why-steroids-have-no-place-in-sports/) athletes to go beyond the recommended medical advice in order to get ahead of their competitors.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Athletes are so prone to injuring themselves in the pursuit of outperforming their competitors that it has its own dedicated field of medicinal practice: Sports Medicine. As technology and resources improve over time, so do athletes' abilities to manage these developments safely.
1.1.1.3. Con: Athletes disinterested in steroid use would still have the option of joining traditional leagues.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Although optional some athletes will feel pressured into taking steroids to keep the playing field level which will exclude those who cannot afford to take the steroids.
1.1.1.5. Pro: Athletes with more ability to pay for steroids would have an advantage over the rest.
1.1.1.6. Pro: Steroids provide athletes with an advantage over their competition, refusing to take steroids would put athletes at a disadvantage.
1.1.1.7. Pro: Coaches and clubs already coerce their athletes into taking PEDs. This would only get worse in a world where there were no consequences.
1.1.1.7.1. Pro: Without any kind of disincentive, the only incentive coaches and clubs have is to be as successful as possible, both in pursuit of success for its own sake, and the financial benefits that come with it. Thus, they are likely to promote PED use to those ends.
1.1.1.7.2. Con: If athletes are being coerced currently, it is grossly unfair that the status quo imposes harsh, individual punishments such as bans.
1.1.1.7.3. Pro: It is [alleged](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/teams/essendon/essendon-players-mother-sarah-interviewed-by-triple-m-host-eddie-mcguire-remains-a-mystery/news-story/287406b5bf3e12bd539b89161fd4f7de?nk=364813c464277304a1125ca0cd31fabc-1517398930) that players involved in the Essendon doping saga \(in the Australian Football League\) were not informed of the side effects of the 'supplements' they were injected with.
1.1.1.7.4. Pro: Given that sporting careers do not typically span a large amount of time, there is an incentive for administrators to prioritise short term performance over long term harms.
1.1.1.7.5. Pro: Countries who hoped to use athletics as a prestige generator have forced their athletes to dope, for example [East Germany](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/east-germanys-forgotten-olympic-doping-6949436).
1.1.1.8. Con: Steroid use is completely voluntary. Individuals should be able to consent to steroid use since no third parties are harmed.
1.1.1.8.1. Con: The requirements of staying competitive as a professional athlete are too coercive. Individuals cannot consent to steroid use under such circumstances.
1.1.1.8.1.1. Pro: Athletes have spent essentially their entire lives singularly devoted to their sport. It is all they have done and trained for since childhood, and their window of opportunity for success is very small compared to other professions. These make it very difficult for an athlete to give up their sport or make fully objective choices regarding it.
1.1.1.8.1.2. Con: Individuals can choose not to be athletes if they do not wish to use steroids.
1.1.1.8.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.8.1.1.
1.1.1.8.1.2.2. Con: We should not force athletes to have to chose between their health/safety and their career/passion.
1.1.1.8.1.3. Pro: The government does not allow individuals to consent to actions where it is likely doing so is against an individual's best interests.
1.1.1.8.1.3.1. Pro: The government will not let you sell your kidney or work in hazardous conditions even if you consent.
1.1.1.8.1.3.2. Con: The government does not have a right to determine what is in the best interests of any individual.
1.1.1.8.1.4. Pro: The pressures of competitiveness, coaches and clubs are likely to create a power imbalance against athletes who wish to refuse steroids.
1.1.1.8.2. Con: In contact sports, a player who is unnaturally strong and fast poses a physical danger to the other players.
1.1.1.8.2.1. Pro: Steroid abuse is harmful to health and any introduction would need to bear in mind the health outcomes of athletes.  For example, contact sports have an ever greater focus on reducing concussion injuries.  Why would any sport allow athletes to put themselves at increased risk by using steroids?
1.1.1.9. Pro: Top performing athletes are offered the best pay, sponsorship deals, opportunities and victories. If competitors are using PEDs to have an advantage, not taking a steroid could threaten the livelihood of an individual athlete or their entire team.
1.1.2. Pro: Wealthier athletes/ teams/ countries are able to [use and conceal their use of PEDs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2012/08/24/why-its-time-to-legalize-steroids-in-professional-sports/#15d2183e65d2) while those without access to medical teams and designer drugs either do not use PEDs, or are caught and punished trying to do so.
1.1.3. Con: Legalising PEDs will only add an additional way in which those with most resources can influence the results of sporting matches/ races etc.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The use of steroids in sports shifts the focus of sports from practice and teamwork to a competition of who has the most money to spend on steroids.
1.1.4. Pro: Currently, athletes who are unwilling to break the rules are at a disadvantage. We shouldn't punish people for acting ethically.
1.1.5. Con: If everyone took steroids, everyone would gain an equal benefit and those with genetic advantages would still outperform those without.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Different athletes respond differently to PEDs for a variety of physiological reasons - e.g. EPO increases red blood cell counts at different rates for different athletes\). It becomes a competition played out in laboratories rather than arenas.
1.1.6. Con: Legalising steroid use will give an advantage to nations \(e.g. [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/09/more-than-1000-russian-athletes-benefitted-from-state-sponsored-doping)\) who have already engaged and invested in dangerous state-sanctioned doping regimes, and thus have access to the most advanced doping technology.
1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3. Pro: Legalising the use of PEDs will create transparency and allow regulation of the market.
1.3.1. Pro: Athletes could be required to state which PEDs they are currently using which would ensure transparency.
1.3.1.1. Pro: There would be very little incentive for athletes to lie, since steroid use would be legal.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Even if steroids are legal, many of the same incentives \(e.g. to get ahead of other competitors, to keep their advantage secret\) could drive athletes to not disclose, or lie about, which steroids they are using, despite them being legal.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: One motivation for athletes to lie about their steroid use would be to prevent others from finding out the specific regimen of PEDs they are taking.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: There will always be an incentive to gain a competitive advantage. This will mean that clubs and athletes will seek out newer, riskier drugs that their competitors don’t yet have access to.
1.3.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: In order to escape detection during drug tests many athletes use [designer steroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_cream). These are novel compounds that have not been tested by any agency for safety in medical or non-medical uses.
1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Another motivation for athletes to lie about steroid use would be to maintain a 'clean' public image.
1.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: If steroids were legal and widely used it is unlikely there would be any stigma against their use.
1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Although it is possible attitudes would change over time, steroid use is currently associated with lying, cheating and athletes who have been stripped of awards. That stigma would survive even if steroids became legal \(and permissible within the rules of sporting tournaments\).
1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The persistence of this stigma would only be reinforced by all the previous scandals involving athletes who were caught using steroids and stripped of their titles. It will take time for those stories to be forgotten.
1.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: Even if the athlete themselves wants to disclose their steroid use, they may be coerced by their team, sponsors, or coaches, to lie about steroid use.
1.3.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.7.
1.3.1.2. Pro: This would allow people to scientifically study the impact of these drugs on the human body for the first time.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: It is very tough to have rigorous scientific analysis on illegal drugs, such as cocaine.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: This would allow athletes to dope more effectively, which increases the overall quality of sports.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: Steroid use makes sports more exciting.
1.3.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: People instinctively find incredible displays of athleticism appealing: think fantastic dunks, long home runs, or the Olympic 100 meter dash. The more of these there are, the more fans will be interested.
1.3.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: What makes these feats of athleticism so appealing is their rarity. If everyone was capable of doing incredible things, that would become normal and thus not exciting.
1.3.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: In 2017, Major League Baseball's [home run rate](https://www.si.com/mlb/2017/09/20/major-league-baseball-single-season-total-home-run-record) was the highest it has ever been, yet 2/3 of team's TV ratings [declined](https://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/local-mlb-tv-ratings-shine-clouds-still-loom/).
1.3.1.2.2.1.1.1.2. Con: There will always be outliers to keep fans interested.
1.3.1.2.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Just as everyone currently in the NBA is more athletic than everyone who was in the NBA in 1965, we still have incredibly exciting athletes like [Blake Griffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN5yO3wHQzM) or [Zach LaVine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYxVcfaGih8).
1.3.1.2.2.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: In a year with the highest home-run rate of all time, baseball fans were mesmerized by [Aaron Judge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh17H6Xxu4I), who hit the ball harder and farther than any other player.
1.3.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Athletes using performance enhancing drugs could make them able to do things that have never been seen before, and because athletics is entertainment, they would be more entertaining.
1.3.1.2.2.1.3. Con: Many viewers prefer to watch athletes who are particularly skilled, as opposed to just freakishly strong. Widespread steroid use prioritises the latter over the former.
1.3.1.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: For example, many people criticise modern men's tennis for being [boring](http://www.tennisnow.com/News/Pat-Cash-Thinks-Modern-Tennis-is-Boring.aspx), because it has become more about brute force than skill and agility.
1.3.1.2.2.1.4. Pro: In 1998, baseball was still suffering from the 1994 players' strike which cancelled the World Series. That year's [steroid-fuelled](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/baseball/longterm/chase/articles/base27.htm) home run barrage revived fan's interest in the sport.
1.3.1.2.2.1.5. Con: Fans are turned off when they perceive players to be cheating.
1.3.1.2.2.1.5.1. Con: Cheating is relative. If steroids were not against the rules, then it would not be cheating to use them.
1.3.1.2.2.1.5.1.1. Con: What matters is the fan's perception of cheating, and these norms have already been well established.
1.3.1.2.2.1.5.2. Con: Steroid use does not affect the rules governing game dynamics and is therefore not cheating. It only changes an individual player's level of skill, as does training and inborn ability.
1.3.1.2.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: Steroids are only seen as "against the spirit of competition" because they are against the rules of most sports. If the rules were changed, steroid use would no longer be seen as "against the spirit of competition."
1.3.1.2.2.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Fans dislike steroid use at present because it is cheating. If steroid use were allowed, it would no longer be cheating and fan attitude would change.
1.3.1.2.2.1.5.2.1.2. Pro: Sports change their rules all the time. It isn't a bad thing for the focus of a sport to change.
1.3.1.2.2.1.5.2.2. Con: Any competition must have rules to keep it structured. Saying one chemical is legal and another is not is no different than saying you must bounce the ball when you move or run in this specific direction to get points.
1.3.2. Pro: Legalising steroids will allow for the regulation of steroids to ensure their safety.
1.3.2.1. Con: Many common steroids used for doping are [approved by the FDA](https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm526151.htm) and other agencies for medical purposes.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.1.2.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: This does not guarantee the safety of using those drugs as PEDs.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Steroid use is unsafe.
1.3.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Most minor doping involves the narrow use of otherwise safe medications, such as a [vasodilator](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/10/how-serious-was-tennis-player-maria-sharapova-doping) before a tennis match.
1.3.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.1.1.
1.3.2.1.2.1.3. Pro: Steroids are used by athletes at doses that are [10-100 times higher](https://www.verywell.com/steroids-in-sports-3120518) than the recommended doses for prescription medical use.
1.3.2.1.2.1.4. Pro: Attempting to emulate the performance of athletes who are using steroids can be dangerous for 'normal' people who may either push themselves too hard trying to reach the standards of their sports heroes, or use steroids without appropriate medical supervision.
1.3.2.1.2.1.4.1. Pro: This is conceptually similar to young women who aspire to look thin like [supermodels](https://www.rehabs.com/explore/dying-to-be-barbie/).
1.3.2.1.2.1.4.2. Con: Even though illegal, most doping regimens are done under the supervision of a doctor.
1.3.2.1.2.1.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.1.3.
1.3.2.1.2.1.4.2.2. Con: Even when used under medical supervision, the use of PEDs carries [serious health risks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2219897/#__secid2669998).
1.3.2.1.2.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: PEDs, whether used as medically advised or abused, can [cause](https://www.verywell.com/steroids-in-sports-3120518) infertility, baldness and/or excessive body hair growth, growth or reduction in size of sexual organs, high blood pressure and cholesterol, heart attacks, cancer, jaundice, rage, aggression, mania and psychosis.
1.3.2.1.2.1.4.2.2.2. Pro: As well as the health risks of taking PEDs, athletes can experience [withdrawal effects](https://www.verywell.com/steroids-in-sports-3120518) including mood swings, fatigue, lack of appetite, irritability, insomnia, aggression, depression and suicide.
1.3.2.1.2.1.5. Pro: Steroids are [addictive](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/anabolic-steroid-abuse/are-anabolic-steroids-addictive). This means that athletes will either suffer from withdrawal or be forced into illegal markets at the point they retire.
1.3.2.1.2.1.6. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.1.4.2.
1.3.2.1.2.1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.8.
1.3.2.1.2.1.8. Pro: Steroid abuse can cause bouts of rage, most famously resulting in the [Chris Benoit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Benoit_double-murder_and_suicide) murder-suicide.
1.3.2.1.2.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.1.4.2.2.
1.3.2.1.2.1.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.8.2.
1.3.2.1.2.1.11. Con: The level of physical toll and risk of injury that is [currently expected/ required](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2012/08/24/why-its-time-to-legalize-steroids-in-professional-sports/#15d2183e65d2) of athletes to reach the top performance standards means that sport itself can be unsafe.
1.3.2.1.2.1.11.1. Con: Sports organisations and governments put forward policies to protect athletes from the worst risks of sport based on their current information, e.g. the protocol changes that followed the [exposure of concussion risk](https://www.bustle.com/articles/128459-how-did-the-events-in-concussion-affect-the-nfl-the-doctor-at-its-heart-changed-everything) in the NFL. Legalising PEDs would be a step in the opposite direction.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Since steroids are obtained illegally, it is often difficult to confirm that the drugs are pure or safe.
1.3.3. Pro: If steroid use is legal, players will be able to seek medical advice and supervision when using steroids.
1.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.1.4.2.
1.3.4. Pro: Currently sports organisations have to navigate [confusing anti-doping policies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2012/08/24/why-its-time-to-legalize-steroids-in-professional-sports/#15d2183e65d2) that vary widely and struggle to keep pace with innovation and advancement.
1.3.4.1. Pro: By definition, enforcement policies are behind the athletes. Regulators cannot ban something until they know what people are using.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Constant improvements in research, technology and medicine blur the lines surrounding what is 'natural', 'legal', 'unnatural' or 'illegal'.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: The line between illegal [blood doping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_doping) and legal [PrP injections](https://www.hss.edu/condition-list_prp-injections.asp) is murky at best.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: In Major League baseball, some stimulants are strictly [restricted](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2012/08/24/why-its-time-to-legalize-steroids-in-professional-sports/#15d2183e65d2), e.g. ephedrine, but others are not, e.g. caffeine.
1.3.5. Pro: Currently athletes who are exceptional are often suspected of steroid use, even if they are passing drug tests. Their achievements are being undermined and discredited by rumour and suspicion surrounding steroid use.
1.3.5.1. Con: The current culture condemning PEDs means that legalization will not undermine people's tendency to discredit the accomplishments of suspected dopers.
1.4. Pro: Legalising the use of steroids will reduce the incidence of cheating in sports.
1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.1.1.
1.4.2. Pro: When steroids are illegal, those who use them gain an unfair advantage. Legalisation evens this playing field by allowing all athletes to use steroids.
1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.4.3. Pro: Since steroid use is commonplace, it makes sense to alter the rules to allow all players to engage in it.
1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.4.3.4. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.1.
1.4.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.4.4. Con: Athletes cheat to gain an advantage over other players. Legalising steroids will simply incentivise cheaters to find new ways to cheat.
1.4.4.1. Con: The incentive to win is already maximized, or at least this doesn't change that. It is likely that people are already doing everything they can, or at least are willing to do.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: The New England Patriots were caught [videotaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_New_England_Patriots_videotaping_controversy) their opponent's practices.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: The Boston Red Sox were caught [stealing signs](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/sports/baseball/boston-red-sox-stealing-signs-yankees.html) using technology, which is against MLB rules.
1.4.4.2. Con: In certain sports, there are only so many areas to get an edge. Track runners cannot start early, for example.
1.4.4.3. Con: The fact that athletes don't already engage in these "new ways of cheating" suggests that such methods are more difficult or provide smaller benefits. As such there is likely to be a net reduction in cheating.
1.4.5. Pro: Cheating, by definition, involves inflicting some form of unfairness or harm onto another. A world where everyone adheres to the same rules is much more fair and thus involves less harm done to people.
1.4.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.4.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.4.5.3. Con: This is an argument against literally any form of regulation that people are likely to break.
1.4.5.4. Pro: Steroids allow people who lack genetic advantages to compete with those who have them.
1.4.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.4.6. Con: This is akin to saying "legalising murder will reduce crime rates".
1.5. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.1.
1.6. Con: Legalising steroids will change the nature and focus of sports.
1.6.1. Pro: Sports are about the 'natural' limits of the human body.
1.6.1.1. Con: Many sports have embraced technology in order to improve athletic performance, e.g. in cycling, modern bikes are far lighter and faster than their older contemporaries.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Competitions based on using technology \(e.g. NASCAR\) are predicated on everyone using the same technology, so that the only true differences are in the athletes themselves.
1.6.1.1.2. Con: The move towards e.g. lighter bikes is indicative of the fact that people find intrinsic value in going fast for its own sake, not just in comparison to their competitors.
1.6.1.2. Pro: [Fast Suits](https://theconversation.com/fast-suits-and-olympic-swimming-a-tale-of-reduced-drag-and-broken-records-7960) have been banned in swimming because they are seen as reducing the spirit of the competition.
1.6.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.
1.6.2. Pro: When steroid use is legal, there will be a greater focus on developing better steroids for athletes instead of improving athletic performance naturally.
1.6.2.1. Con: Since all athletes will have access to the same steroids, it will still be necessary for athletes to work on their 'natural performance.'
1.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.1.1.
1.6.2.3. Con: New technology also provides athletes with an advantage, yet athletes still work to improve their 'natural' performance.
1.6.2.4. Con: The people who develop better PEDs are different from the people who develop better training regimens or work with athletes directly.
1.6.3. Con: The introduction of new technology in sports hasn't fundamentally changed the focus or nature of sports.
1.6.3.1. Pro: If anything, it has improved the existing aspects.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: Advances in medicine have allowed players to return from injury and/or prolong their careers.
1.6.3.1.1.1. Pro: Longer, healthier careers allow fans to enjoy their favorite players more.
1.6.3.1.1.2. Pro: Longer, healthier careers allow players to make more money from their short earning windows.
1.6.4. Pro: Legalising steroids will undermine existing 'natural' records.
1.6.4.1. Con: Better technology has allowed athletes to beat older records. This hasn't undermined those records.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.2.
1.6.5. Pro: Emphasising physical dominance over other elements of competition will make sports less enjoyable to watch and compete in.
1.6.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.2.2.1.
1.6.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.2.1.3.
1.6.6. Con: -> See 1.3.1.2.2.1.5.2.1.2.
1.6.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.6.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.6.9. Pro: Legalization will make players go too far. There is value in seeing players play naturally.
1.6.10. Con: The nature of sport, the principle of sport will lose its meaning. The true principle of sport is in bettering oneself according to the possibilities of the human body, mind-emotional-energetic level and spirit. Also it opens the door to higher possibilities - physiological limitations are expanding like there are levels with certain range.
1.6.11. Pro: If you have a sports record made by an athlete not using steroids, it is a record made with natural talent. Performance enhancing steroids pollute the sports environment that should consist of all-natural talent in competition. Steroid use should be banned from sports.
1.7. Pro: The purpose of sports is to find the limits of the human body.
1.7.1. Pro: People innately find human extremes \(intelligence, speed, strength\) fascinating, and set up tests to find the most extreme cases. We now consider these tests to be sports.
1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.6.1.
1.7.3. Pro: Allowing the use of PEDs and observing the results would advance science.
1.7.4. Con: There is a lot of debate about what [sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport) is and what its purpose is. For example, sport was once linked with preparing people for war, a function it no longer holds for most modern societies.
1.7.4.1. Con: Even then, certain people were renowned specifically for their athletic prowess \(e.g. they could run faster than anyone else or throw a spear farther\).
1.7.4.2. Con: While the origins of organized training may be to prepare for war, the idea of, for example, making everyone run as fast as possible for a certain arbitrary distance to see who won is designed solely for determining the fastest person.
1.8. Pro: Steroids are very similar to any other modern technology or training methods athletes use to get ahead of their competition.
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.1.
1.8.2. Pro: [Plenty of athletes](https://deadspin.com/why-dont-we-let-injured-athletes-use-peds-513135553) used PEDs to recover from injuries faster.
1.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.1.1.1.
1.8.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.1.1.2.
1.8.2.3. Pro: HGH \(Human Growth Hormone\) can be [used](https://deadspin.com/why-dont-we-let-injured-athletes-use-peds-513135553) to help repair and strengthen injured muscles and ligaments.
1.8.2.3.1. Pro: This could shorten recovery times for athletes allowing them to play again sooner after injury.
1.8.2.3.2. Pro: This could also allow athletes to recover from 'career-ending' injuries.
1.8.2.4. Con: This is a reason to legalise the use of steroids for medical purposes. There is no reason to extend this to active use in sports.
1.8.2.4.1. Con: It is hard to draw a line between a medical and non-medical use.
1.8.2.4.1.1. Pro: Using steroids for a medical purpose like recovering from an injury, would still confer a benefit even once a player recovered.
1.8.2.5. Pro: Not all steroids are the same and the ones that allow you to heal faster from sprains and injury are not available to people who train day in and day out.
1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.1.
1.8.4. Con: -> See 1.3.1.2.2.1.5.2.2.
1.8.5. Pro: In the workplace, people drink coffee to augment performance.
1.8.6. Con: -> See 1.6.1.2.
1.9. Con: Legalizing steroids and other performance enhancing drugs would have negative externalities.
1.9.1. Pro: Governments invest heavily in sports because of their role in promoting healthy living and exercise. This public health message is compromised at the point many athletes are using drugs.
1.9.1.1. Con: Many PEDs are not illegal to use, but are merely banned by the rules of various sports. Changing the rules of those sports would simply bring them in line with the law, and what the general public is allowed to do.
1.9.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.9.2. Pro: Advertisers are not likely to respond positively to having their brand associated with the use of substances which are illegal for the majority of the population.
1.9.2.1. Con: -> See 1.9.1.1.
1.9.2.2. Con: Major drug scandals are currently [economically devastating](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-17351951) for advertisers. Getting rid of anti-doping regulation insulates them from these shocks.
1.9.3. Con: Legalising steroid use would benefit intersex athletes.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Under status quo, intersex athletes who identify as women aren’t allowed compete in female categories, because their naturally high levels of testosterone are considered an [unfair advantage](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/magazine/the-humiliating-practice-of-sex-testing-female-athletes.html), tantamount to doping. This would not be a problem if steroid use was legalised.
1.9.3.2. Con: This issue could easily be resolved without going to the lengths of legalising performance enhancing drugs. Given that the Olympics now [allows](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3412969/Olympics-change-policies-allow-transgender-athletes-compete-without-having-gender-reassignment-surgery.html) trans women to compete in the women's category without undergoing surgical transition, it seems feasible that rules can be adjusted to allow intersex women to compete as well.
1.10. Pro: Steroid use will happen regardless of whether or not it is legal.
1.10.1. Con: Steroid use will only occur when the benefits of doping outweigh the risks, increasing penalties for doping \(and increasing screening\) could drastically reduce its occurrence.
1.10.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.
1.10.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.10.3. Pro: Legalizing steroid use helps regulate the market and provide better care to athletes who choose to take them.
1.10.4. Pro: Many famous and successful athletes have been found guilty of doping multiple times.
1.10.4.1. Pro: [Alex Rodriguez](https://www.mlb.com/yankees/news/arbitrator-rules-alex-rodriguez-to-be-suspended-for-2014-season/c-66433260), one of the best baseball players ever, served a season long suspension for PEDs.
1.10.4.2. Pro: [Jenrry Mejia](http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/14768114/jenrry-mejia-new-york-mets-suspended-permanently-mlb-third-positive-ped-test) was banned from baseball for life for a 3rd PED suspension.
1.10.4.3. Pro: Sprinter [Justin Gatlin](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/12/19/u-s-sprinter-justin-gatlin-involved-in-doping-investigation/?utm_term=.2e2245763411) has been suspended twice for PEDs and is currently under investigation again.
1.10.5. Con: This is an argument against literally any kind of regulation. Presumably the penalties have at least a marginal impact, which means the question must be whether that marginal reduction is worth it.
1.11. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.2.1.
1.12. Con: This would allow athletes to use drugs which are illegal for the general population.
1.12.1. Pro: Allowing athletes to use substances which are banned in the general population reinforces the problematic idea that they are above the laws and rules of society.
1.12.1.1. Pro: The conviction rates for professional athletes are "[astonishingly low](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/07/01/should-character-matter-in-pro-sports/athletes-get-off-easy-when-they-are-violent)." Top performing athletes are often [treated differently](https://www.phillyvoice.com/conestoga-football-no-gay-thursday-athlete-worship/) and poor behaviour is excused due to their value on the sports pitch. This can create a sense of [narcissism and omnipotence](https://www.cnbc.com/id/100942614) in the athlete who receives special treatment.
1.12.1.2. Con: -> See 1.9.1.1.
1.12.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.12.1.4. Con: Steroids should not be banned in the first place.
1.12.2. Con: Many athletes [already use](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/ice-being-used-as-performance-enhancing-drug-at-local-football-clubs-20150322-1m58ug.html) illegal drugs such as amphetamines to improve their performance.
1.12.3. Pro: [Stimulants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9809128), such as amphetamines, can be used to enhance performance. The abuse of these drugs will increase if it is legalised.
1.12.3.1. Con: Decriminalization of drug use does not not necessarily lead to abuse. See [Portugal's drug laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_Portugal) for an example.
1.12.4. Pro: Given there is a strong '[party culture](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/pg778z/athletes-absolutely-party-sex-sports-social-media-rio-olympics)' within professional sports, it is highly likely athletes will abuse these drugs recreationally as well as using them to enhance performance.
1.12.5. Con: This is a non-sequiturial fallback argument. The entire point of the argument is to allow restricted drug use for registered and monitored athletes.
1.12.6. Con: We could make them legal for the general population
1.13. Pro: The ways in which drugs are regulated within sports are unfair for athletes.
1.13.1. Pro: The process of drug testing is unfair and invasive.
1.13.1.1. Pro: Drug testing violates athletes' privacy.
1.13.1.1.1. Pro: [Urine testing](https://www.inverse.com/article/19918-drug-testing-athletes-morality-banned-substances-olympics) requires athletes to go to the bathroom in front of a total stranger, which can be deeply confronting and humiliating for them.
1.13.1.1.2. Con: Drug testing is no more invasive than other procedures athletes undergo regularly \(e.g. being in a communal locker room, or receiving physio treatment\).
1.13.1.1.2.1. Con: Athletes have more choice over these other procedures \(e.g. whether to receive physio treatment or not\) than over invasive drug testing.
1.13.1.2. Pro: 'Random' drug tests profile athletes based on their physical characteristics.
1.13.1.2.1. Pro: Female athletes are more likely to be tested for [hyperandrogenism](https://www.inverse.com/article/19918-drug-testing-athletes-morality-banned-substances-olympics) if they appear masculine.
1.13.1.2.2. Con: In league sports, the rate of testing is collectively bargained and uniform.
1.13.1.2.3. Con: In non-league sports, all athletes are required to submit to a certain number of random tests per year, as well as at competitions.
1.13.2. Pro: The rules around what is legal and illegal in sports are sufficiently unclear such that athletes can be penalised without realising or intending to commit an offence.
1.13.2.1. Pro: Maria Sharapova was suspended for taking a banned substance she [did not know](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2017/04/17/maria-sharapova-says-she-had-to-google-the-drug-she-was-taking/#6374dd295a3a) was in a heart medication she was taking.
1.13.3. Pro: Drug regulations unfairly penalise athletes with mental and physical health conditions.
1.13.3.1. Pro: [Ritalin](https://theconversation.com/athletes-need-performance-enhancing-drugs-to-treat-illness-13718), a drug used to treat the symptoms of ADHD, is banned by the World Anti Doping Authority.
1.13.3.2. Con: Many sports leagues offer "[therapeutic use exemptions](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do/science-medical/therapeutic-use-exemptions)" for doctor-prescribed drugs like amphetamines for ADHD.
1.13.3.2.1. Pro: This system can easily be [abused](http://www.bbc.com/sport/37382825) by athletes and unscrupulous doctors.
1.13.4. Con: Though a few individual athletes with unique circumstances may suffer under drug testing, it protects the vast majority.
1.13.5. Con: Regulation can be improved to make it more fair. The fact that some rules are bad is not a reason to do away with regulation altogether.
1.14. Con: Steroid use goes against the spirit of competition.
1.14.1. Pro: Many fans view athletes as something to aspire towards, and strive to emulate their fitness and skill. Steroid use makes these aspirations impossible to ever naturally achieve.
1.14.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.1.4.
1.14.1.2. Con: The very nature of being a 'high-performance' or 'professional' athlete involves regularly performing feats of skill, strength, or will that lie well outside the boundaries of what is achievable by any 'normal person'. Preventing athletes from achieving even greater performance because they would be ''too good'' is a redundant statement. Professional athletes are only professional because they're already capable of achieving far better than statistical norms.
1.14.1.3. Con: Many other factors, like expensive technology, make it impossible for fans to achieve the same level of performance as athletes.
1.14.2. Pro: Sports is the voluntary acceptance of unnecessary obstacles so that we have a united baseline to determine the "best."
1.14.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.2.
1.14.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.2.2.1.5.2.1.
1.14.4. Con: Athletes have traditionally pursued every possible advantage in the 'spirit of competition' - steroid use is no different.
1.14.5. Con: Competition has never been fair as it is heavily based on genetics, diet, upbringing and so forth. As such there is no such thing as fair competition in sports.
1.14.6. Pro: Steroid use takes the onus off the athlete and puts it in the hands of governments or company's that can spend to create cutting-edge PED. This means an average athlete in skill belonging to a large company will be equivalent to a talented athlete belonging to a small company. This would widen the gap between the effects of science and the natural born talent of an athlete.
1.15. Pro: Competition could be divided into 'enhanced' and 'normal' categories. Any legal enhancement would be allowed in 'Enhanced' competition.
1.15.1. Pro: Giving enhancement-using athletes their own no-holds-barred competition may remove them from competition with clean athletes.
1.15.2. Con: With drug usage allowed, athletes may consume substances to the detriment of their health, mental or physical.
1.15.3. Con: Having separate categories would not completely remove cheating. Taking steroids, but hiding it and competing in "normal" category would still be tempting.
1.15.3.1. Con: It's possible to test athletes for steroid use.
1.15.4. Con: -> See 1.14.6.
1.15.5. Pro: Sports are a form of entertainment. There will be a time when a separate category for PEDs is created. The audience will then dictate with their wallets whether this is to stay or go.  I believe that it will overtake traditional sports with dramatic action.
