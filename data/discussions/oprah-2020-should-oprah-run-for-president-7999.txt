Discussion Title: Oprah 2020: Should Oprah Run For President?

1. Oprah should run for president of the United States in 2020.
1.1. Con: Oprah promotes various ["snake oil" products](http://thefederalist.com/2018/01/09/remember-oprah-winfrey-premier-national-snake-oil-salesman/), which calls her integrity into question when it comes to running for office.
1.2. Pro: Oprah comes from humble origins, and has become successful despite past hardships. This is a quality greatly admired by many people.
1.2.1. Con: Humble origins and success in the face of adversity are indeed admirable, but other qualities are arguably more important for a potential presidential candidate.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Oprah has no substantive political experience.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Donald Trump also had no political experience, now he is the president.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The fact that he is president does not mean that he should be president.
1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Donald Trump's lack of experience has arguably already led to many bad decisions for the US as a country.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Oprah has no foreign policy experience.
1.2.1.1.3. Pro: Donald Trump's lack of previous political experience was a significant argument to label him as unqualified.  Those who opposed Trump as a candidate at least in part for this reason can't logically conclude that Oprah makes a qualified candidate.
1.2.1.1.4. Pro: This level of politics is highly complicated and experience in lawmaking and foreign policy helps in decision making.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Experience holding public office \(at the state or local level\) or the military should be a prerequisite for the presidency. Since Oprah has neither, she should not run for president of the United States.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The President, especially, needs a record of being elected by the public, found worthy of being re-elected by the public, and have a record of being accountable to the public. The Presidency is not an entry-level position. If Oprah wants to get into politics, let her run for state legislature or, at the highest, a US House position first.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Most people who support Oprah's politics have argued that Trump is unqualified because he lacks public service experience. It would be hippocritical for these people to vote for Oprah.
1.2.1.2.3. Con: Holding public office and/or military experience should not be prerequisites for the presidency.
1.2.1.3. Pro: In her career, Oprah has not had to think deeply about issues pertaining to public policy or national security, both of which should be crucial for a presidential candidate.
1.3. Con: At the very least, a candidate should be interested in running for \(and winning\) the presidency. Oprah has recently stated that [she is not interested](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/25/oprah-says-shes-not-interested-but-americans-say-she-could-beat-trump/?utm_term=.ba991a444ab8) in running. So, she should not run.
1.4. Con: The American government is already criticized for the role corporations play in politics and for how wealthy many politicians are. An Oprah candidacy/presidency could set a dangerous precedent forcing the poor or middle class to accept that public discourse should be left to the top .01%
1.5. Con: The nomination of candidates like Oprah or Mark Zuckerberg, candidates with little political experience, would hamstring attempts by the democrats to have a coherent policy agenda that could oppose the Republicans.
1.5.1. Con: A coherent policy agenda for the party is the responsibility of the 'professionals' already in charge. New candidates adopt the strategy, not rewrite it.
1.6. Con: [Most](http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/misc/usapolls/us180108_PBS_NPR/UPDATED_NPR_PBS%20NewsHour_Marist%20Poll_National%20Nature%20of%20the%20Sample%20and%20Tables_January%202018.pdf#page=3) people do not want Oprah as president.
1.6.1. Con: While it is true that a majority of people do not want Oprah to run for President, said study shows that, if it were a head-to-head between Oprah Winfrey and Donald Trump, 50% of people would vote for Winfrey and 39% for Trump, leaving 11% undecided.
1.6.2. Con: Presidents are sometimes elected without winning the majority vote. Both Trump and Bush jr lost the popular vote but were still elected. Therefore, it does not matter if "most" people do not want Oprah to be president.
1.7. Pro: Oprah is qualified for the office of the presidency of the United States.
1.7.1. Pro: Oprah meets the three eligibility requirements for the presidency as outlined in Article II of the US Constitution.[archives.gov](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-article-ii-)
1.7.1.1. Con: Eligibility requirements and qualifications are different kinds of things. So, just because Oprah is eligible does not mean she is qualified.
1.7.2. Pro: Oprah may lack experience in the public sector, but she possesses a wealth of experience growing a business empire.
1.7.2.1. Con: Business and the public sector are different. Experience and success in one does not mean that a person will be successful in the other.
1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.7.4. Con: Oprah is unqualified to run for president of the United States.
1.7.4.1. Pro: This is no evidence which indicates that Oprah has the high degree of competence necessary in politics to create a positive impact as president.
1.7.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.7.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.7.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.7.4.5. Con: Professional experience in entertainment or business should not be seen as disqualifying. What Oprah may lack in knowledge and experience with public policy, national security, and so forth, may be addressed via cabinet appointments.
1.7.4.6. Con: Oprah meets the three eligibility requirements for the presidency as outlined in Article II of the US Constitution.[archives.gov](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-article-ii-)
1.7.4.6.1. Con: Eligibility requirements and qualifications are different kinds of things. So, just because Oprah is eligible does not mean she is qualified.
1.7.4.7. Con: Oprah may be deemed unqualified if one uses past standards \(i.e. pre-2016 election cycle\) to evaluate her potential candidacy. The rules have changed.
1.7.4.8. Pro: Oprah has contributed to the spread of pseudoscience, including giving Jenny McCarthy a platform for her very dangerous anti-vaccine views.[Oprah’s anti-science history.](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/1/9/16868216/oprah-winfrey-pseudoscience)
1.7.5. Pro: Through her years of experience interviewing people from all walks of life, Oprah understands what many in the United States want and need.
1.8. Con: Oprah should not run but should instead campaign for a candidate like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.
1.8.1. Con: Bernie Sanders has on multiple occasions stated that he wants to tax 'the billionaires' a lot more. Oprah Winfrey has a net worth of $3 billion \([forbes](https://www.forbes.com/profile/oprah-winfrey/)\) and is therefore highly unlikely to campaign  for someone like Sanders because it would hurt her own immediate intrest.
1.8.2. Pro: She can win but should she? She has no political experience, and after Trump especially, America will need a seasoned politician in the Oval Office.
1.9. Con: By nominating a celebrity, Democrats would undermine claims that they are the more serious party.
1.9.1. Pro: Democrats should nominate a serious progressive candidate with a proven track record; someone who has been on the right side of history throughout the years, like Bernie Sanders.
1.9.2. Pro: An Oprah vs Trump election would be a reality tv show. No one would be able to take it seriously.
1.9.2.1. Con: A sensational election does not negate the relevance of the presidential candidates, their positions, or their policy.
1.9.3. Pro: Another major show business persona entering and possibly winning the presidential race would strengthen the unhealthy cult of personality already existing in \(not only american\) society.
1.9.3.1. Con: We know nothing about a successful show business personas ability to understand issues, sway people with arguments and other political skills.
1.10. Pro: Oprah could be an effective campaigner and win the presidency.
1.10.1. Con: Oprah's election might only stand as the antithesis to Trump. Where Trump is extreme right Winfrey would be extreme left, serving no other purpose.
1.10.2. Pro: Trump would have a hard time campaigning against Oprah.
1.10.2.1. Pro: As one of the most liked people in America, Oprah could beat Donald Trump.
1.10.2.1.1. Pro: Oprah has a strong connection to regular people and understands issues that face everyday Americans.
1.10.2.2. Con: Trump might have an easier time running against another celebrity. The debate would be less about policy and qualifications and more about image.
1.10.3. Con: Campaigning plays to the strengths of a show business persona. Oprah would be effective at it. But it doesn't imply that she would be a good president.
1.10.4. Con: Her past association with a long term, known sexual predator, Harvey Weinstein, [snopes.com](https://www.snopes.com/oprah-kissing-weinstein-cheek/) and other less than stellar Hollywood types could  be successfully used against her.
1.10.5. Pro: A Rasmussen poll on January 10, 2018, found that Oprah would defeat Trump by 10 points if the election had been held that day. [rasmussenreports.com](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/january_2018/oprah_vs_the_donald_and_the_winner_is)
1.10.5.1. Con: She can win but should she? She has no political experience, and after Trump especially, America will need a seasoned politician in the Oval Office.
1.10.6. Pro: The prospect of a female African American president would activitate diversity-embracing voters.
1.10.6.1. Pro: A Rasmussen poll on January 10, 2018, found that Oprah would defeat Trump by 10 points if the election had been held that day. [rasmussenreports.com](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/january_2018/oprah_vs_the_donald_and_the_winner_is)
1.10.6.1.1. Con: She can win but should she? She has no political experience, and after Trump especially, America will need a seasoned politician in the Oval Office.
1.10.7. Pro: Oprah could self-fund her campaign if needed, and could quickly create a powerful fundraising network of elites.
1.10.8. Pro: Donald Trump has shown us that TV celebrities can win the presidency.
1.10.9. Pro: Shaun King has [written on the intercept](https://theintercept.com/2018/01/14/2020-election-oprah-trump-michelle-obama-bernie-sanders-joe-biden/) that an ideal candidate to oppose Trump in the 2020 election must possess four things, and that Oprah does, in fact, possess those things.
1.10.9.1. Pro: An ideal candidate to oppose Trump must have a gargantuan social media following across multiple platforms.
1.10.9.2. Pro: Oprah has an established large core base of supporters.
1.10.9.3. Pro: Oprah presents a strong contrast in both character and personality to President Trump.
1.10.9.3.1. Con: Oprah's public persona has been carefully designed and managed over time. Any conclusions drawn about the qualities of character and personality ought to take this into account.
1.10.9.4. Pro: Oprah has a demonstrated ability to organize people around a cause.
1.10.9.5. Con: King notes that Oprah is not the only person who possesses the four qualities necessary to oppose Trump. Hence, these qualities do not distinguish her from other potential candidates.
1.10.10. Con: The likelihood of winning shouldn't be the main argument for running. It says nothing about possible consequences of Oprah presidency.
1.11. Con: -> See 1.7.4.
1.12. Pro: Oprah is a powerful orator.
1.12.1. Con: To be the president of a country, it is not enough to simply be a powerful speaker. This is only one skill of many in which Oprah would need to be qualified.
1.13. Pro: Oprah would be the first black female president of the United States.
1.13.1. Pro: It is reasonable to assume that an African American female would yield positive policy results for disadvantaged minorities.
1.13.2. Con: Race and gender does not make one a good president. Choosing a president only on the basis of race or sex undermines the seriousness of politics.
1.13.3. Con: There are more important qualities to prioritize in a candidate for presidency than race.
1.14. Con: We know very little about where Oprah stands on the issues facing the nation.
1.15. Pro: Oprah embodies many of the values of the Democratic party and could mobilize many of its voters by getting media traction on key issues.
1.15.1. Pro: She would be the best. An openminded person.
