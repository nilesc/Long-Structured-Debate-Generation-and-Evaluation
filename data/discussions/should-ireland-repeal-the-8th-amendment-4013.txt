Discussion Title: Should Ireland Repeal the 8th Amendment?

1. Ireland Should Repeal the 8th Amendment
1.1. Con: This is too complex an issue to leave in the hands of politicians.
1.2. Con: A long history of violently oppressing women cannot be solved by taking that same mentality and turning on another section of the human race. Abortion does not liberate women.
1.2.1. Con: It liberates women insofar as it allows them to have control over their own bodies.
1.2.2. Con: A foetus cannot in any way be looked at equally as a woman
1.3. Con: Bodily autonomy begins in the womb
1.3.1. Con: The Irish Supreme Court has [ruled](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/supreme-court-rules-only-constitutional-right-of-the-unborn-is-right-to-life-1.3417970) that the only constitutional right conferred to an unborn child is the right to life stated in the 8th amendment.
1.3.2. Con: A non-viable foetus is not an autonomous being, since it is completely reliant on the body of the person carrying it.
1.3.3. Con: There is no bodily autonomy for fetuses.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Bodily autonomy is granted to legal persons. For example, a fetus under 24 weeks does not have [personhood](https://embryo-ethics.smd.qmul.ac.uk/key-facts/personhood/) under UK law.
1.4. Pro: Irish people are already getting abortions, either by travelling to other countries or obtaining pills illegally. Repealing the 8th Amendment would allow them to access these abortions in a much safer, less expensive and more dignified way.
1.5. Pro: It allows for the termination of pregnancies in situations of rape.
1.5.1. Con: Studies conducted in 1987 and again in [2004](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/psrh/full/3711005.pdf) \(pdf\) show that [less than 1%](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html) of pregnancies in the US are terminated because of rape.
1.5.1.1. Pro: In the study conducted in 1987, the number was the same as 2004 suggesting that there would be no significant change in abortions for reasons of rape.
1.6. Pro: Constitutional articles are brief and absolute and as such are not suited to contentious points.
1.6.1. Pro: Complexity is better suited to specific legislation than constitutional amendments which tend to be too concise and absolute to cater to all cases.
1.7. Pro: It allows for termination in cases of Fatal Foetal Abnormalities where the foetus would not survive independently outside the womb.
1.7.1. Pro: Currently, parents either have to wait for a fetus to die during pregnancy, or go the UK to get an abortion, as in the case of [this couple](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/fatal-foetal-abnormality-the-kindest-thing-for-our-baby-was-to-terminate-1.3478014), whose baby had a severe genetic disorder.
1.8. Con: It is possible to modify Amendments without repealing them. This might offer a solution which would keep more of the populace happy.
1.8.1. Con: If there are significant protests against a constitutional item it signifies that it no longer represents the will of the people.
1.8.2. Con: Unfortunately there has been no willingness from those who support the 8th to make any changes to the existing article so there is no reason to think that there would be now.
1.9. Con: The right to life of the fetus would be removed
1.10. Pro: It takes the question of women's health out of the hands of the government and gives women bodily autonomy.
1.10.1. Con: Ireland ranks joint 6th in the world for [safe care of pregnant women](http://www.thejournal.ie/maternal-deaths-mortality-rate-ireland-pro-life-campaign-statistics-2921139-Aug2016/), higher than the UK. So there's utterly no proof that it's necessary for health reasons.
1.10.1.1. Con: Aggregate statistics aren't really appropriate here, certainly not as the only gauge. If a small number of people die as a consequence of not having medical options then there is strong evidence, evidence that aggregate statistics won't reflect.
1.10.2. Con: Women's health will still be governed by health policy, all a repeal vote will do is remove the barriers to legislating for women's health that were created by the 8th amendment.
1.11. Con: The Catholic Church has come out against it.
1.11.1. Con: Non-Catholic people should not be forced to abide by the beliefs of a religion they do not follow.
1.11.2. Pro: Irish Bishops have [warned](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/bishops-warn-against-abortion-on-demand-1.3487675) that changing the amendment might lead to "abortion on demand".
1.11.2.1. Pro: The [phrase](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/phrase-abortion-on-demand-has-dishonest-edge-1.2702041) "on demand" has certain negative connotations, that are invoked by using this phrase.
1.11.2.1.1. Pro: It suggests people who want to have an abortion are impatient consumers, and that an abortion is a consumer item.
1.11.3. Con: The Catholic Church has often been on the wrong side of history so its involvement is irrelevant.
1.11.3.1. Con: The opinion of any institution that has the support of a large percentage \(78% in 2016 [cso.ie](http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp8iter/p8iter/p8rrc/)\) of the population is relevant, regardless of whether one thinks it is "right" or "wrong".
