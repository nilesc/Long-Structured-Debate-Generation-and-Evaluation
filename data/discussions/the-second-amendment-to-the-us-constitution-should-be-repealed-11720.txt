Discussion Title: The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution should be repealed.

1. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution should be repealed.
1.1. Con: Not having a guarantee to bear arms puts potential victims at risk of being unable to defend themselves.
1.1.1. Con: [Guns kept in the home](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/guns-in-the-homesafe-storage-statistics/) are more likely to be involved in a fatal or nonfatal unintentional shooting, criminal assault or suicide attempt than to be used to injure or kill in self-defense.
1.1.1.1. Pro: The risk of dying from an unintentional gunshot injury is [3.7 times higher for adults living in homes with guns](http://The risk of dying from an unintentional gunshot injury is 3.7 times higher for adults living in homes with guns. The ownership of guns does not help people defend themselves; although, it increases the chance that they will die from an unintentional gunshot injury.).
1.1.1.2. Con: You do not have to kill or injure somebody to successfully use a gun to defend yourself.  There are no reliable metrics for Defensive Gun Uses.  Estimates range [from 500,000 per year to 3 million a year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulhsieh/2018/04/30/that-time-the-cdc-asked-about-defensive-gun-uses/#2f88c2e6299a).
1.1.1.3. Pro: Unless extensively trained as the law enforcement people are, [trying to use a gun as a defense during an attack is more likely to get you killed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?=574&v=8QjZY3WiO9s) than if you did nothing.
1.1.2. Con: Without the Second Amendment, the number of arms in society as well as the threats faced by individuals would be lower, thus there would be less need for defense with guns.
1.1.2.1. Con: The threats faced by individuals are the crimes, not the means of forcing those crimes. Standard practice is to assume a robber has a weapon, regardless as to whether it can be seen.
1.1.3. Pro: Those who are willing to break the law through either aggravated battery or other violent crimes will not be deterred from owning guns simply because it is made illegal. This will effectively guarantee that only criminals will own guns, giving them a distinct advantage over unarmed, law abiding citizens.
1.1.3.1. Con: Making such a thing illegal, or at least have more restrictions, would make it significantly harder for criminals to get guns. Obviously there will still be gun violence, but reducing the overall amount is better than leaving it as it is.
1.1.4. Pro: The best equalizer in a fight is a firearm. A 250lb man will win almost all physical confrontations with a 120lb woman, but a firearm equalizes the fight. Same can be said of any physical advantage.
1.1.5. Con: Repealing the Second Amendment would not make gun ownership illegal.
1.1.5.1. Con: But it would open the door to making gun ownership illegal.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: This is a slippery slope fallacy. Doing something does not necessitate doing a more extreme version of that thing.
1.1.5.1.2. Con: Even accepting the Slippery Slope Fallacy, if guns were made illegal then the rates of mass shootings would likely decrease as over 80% of firearms used in mass shootings were legally acquired [www.msnbc.com](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/most-guns-mass-shootings-obtained-legally)
1.1.6. Pro: By refusing to allow citizens the right and responsibility to protect themselves, the government [becomes responsible](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/research/JLPP/upload/Rizzi-note-final.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjI7Oy_ptvbAhVRuVkKHTNTD6EQFjAAegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw259Qgr3w-odVM0dYwBnlP9) for their protection. This opens the floodgates to allow the government to be liable for every criminal act that could have reasonably be prevented with the ownership or use of a firearm.
1.1.7. Con: Repealing the Second Amendment would not necessarily affect this right at all. Adding a new amendment that bans Americans defending themselves is not the proposal.
1.1.8. Con: Since the Dickey amendment limits gun related research, and local to federal LEO’s don’t collect data on defensive uses of firearms starting with draw and threaten, there is no way to know if defensive uses are even relevant.
1.1.9. Con: Gun rights advocates often say things like "we need guns to defend ourselves" and "without guns, there will still be plenty of other ways to hurt people", without seeing the contradiction. If there will still be plenty of ways to hurt people, then there will also be ways to defend oneself.
1.1.9.1. Con: Guns act as an equalizer. Most people, regardless of physical stature or athletic ability, can train to defend themselves competently with firearms.
1.1.9.1.1. Con: Guns are not equalizers, since not all guns are equal.
1.1.9.1.1.1. Con: Not all guns are equalizers in all cases, but guns can eliminate the biggest discrepancy in combat- the physical abilities or their absence.
1.1.9.1.2. Con: If one person has a gun and another doesn't, those two are even more unequal in power than if both were unarmed. So unless you want a mandate to carry guns, there is no equalizing effect.
1.1.9.1.2.1. Con: There is absolutely and irrefutably an equalizing effect.  Any argument otherwise is patently absurd.  If a person is armed they will be able to defend themselves in a wide variety of scenarios they otherwise may be completely defenseless in.

Obviously, a prerequisite is that one must actually be armed.

Obviously, perfect equality in outcomes cannot be obtained.

The right to defend oneself or others is an individual right.   One may choose to not exercise it.
1.2. Con: Several industries in America benefit from the Second Amendment and its implications. Repealing the Amendment would hurt those industries.
1.2.1. Pro: The annual revenue of the gun and ammunition manufacturing industry was [$13.5 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/02/americas-gun-business-by-the-numbers.html) and the gun industry as a whole employed [287,986](https://money.cnn.com/2016/04/18/news/economy/guns-jobs/index.html) people in 2015.
1.2.2. Con: This suggests that other industries wouldn't arise. The second amendment wasn't written to create or protect industry, but to protect our freedoms as citizens.
1.2.3. Con: A balance between industry and the positive outcomes of that industry for society needs to take a precedence. The same argument can also be applied elsewhere: we should legalise heroin because it would create a successful industry.
1.2.4. Con: Funeral services will not be impacted, since everyone dies eventually one way or the other. Gun violence does not increase the number of deaths, only the number of premature deaths.
1.2.4.1. Con: Premature deaths impact funeral cash-flows, so they have indeed a financial impact.
1.2.5. Con: Hospitals are negatively impacted by gun violence, since people who are shot and killed by the age of 20 could otherwhise live on and get cancer or require dialysis, which is much more profitable.
1.2.5.1. Con: That said, [most shootings are not fatal.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4700838/) So for every three men who are shot, one of whom dies, two of the men receive some early gunshot treatment, and still get cancer later on. And since there is a span of around 40 years between their gunshot wound and their cancer, the interest gained by placing the gunshot profits into a savings scheme might compensate for the loss of the cancer patient later on.
1.2.6. Pro: Ballistic experts and many forensic technicians owe their jobs to guns.
1.3. Pro: The Second Amendment is an anachronism.
1.3.1. Pro: The intention behind the Second Amendment was to prevent the federal government from interfering with the militias of states. Since states no longer have militias, this renders the amendment an anachronism.
1.3.1.1. Con: In recent years there have been [various militia groups](http://www.researchforprogress.us/rwpop/nwo.html) operating in various states. "During the mid-1990s, armed militias were sporadically active in all fifty states, with total membership estimated at between 20,000 and 60,000."
1.3.1.1.1. Con: These are not militias in the sense [the founding fathers meant](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/opinion/john-paul-stevens-repeal-second-amendment.html), since they don't reduce the threat that a national standing army might pose to the security of the separate states.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: According to [Stevens](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/opinion/john-paul-stevens-repeal-second-amendment.html), the founders intended the militia to counter the "concern that a national standing army might pose a threat to the security of the separate states".  If the size and firepower of the militia is insufficient to perform that function that does not mean the militia is not a militia. It only means the militia needs to be larger.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If the militia was insufficient, this would mean the US is not a free and safe state.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: A threat to security does not equate to an elimination of freedom.
1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Rather than increasing the size of the national standing army, the US has instead relied on civilian, [private military](https://www.amazon.com/Corporate-Warriors-Privatized-Military-Industry/dp/0801474361) groups for national defense. By limiting the size of the army, the existence and use of armed civilians has reduced the threat that a national standing army might pose to the security of the separate states which is exactly as the founders had hoped.
1.3.1.1.1.3. Con: Founder Richard Henry [Lee wrote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Henry_Lee) the militia includes, "all men capable of bearing arms" and goes on, "all regulations tending to render this general militia useless and defenceless, by establishing select corps of militia, or distinct bodies of military men, not having permanent interests and attachments in the community to be avoided."
1.3.1.2. Con: Founder [Richard Henry Lee](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Henry_Lee) did not express concern that the fed would "interfere" with state militias. Lee wrote, "all regulations tending to render this general militia useless and defenceless, by establishing select corps of militia, or distinct bodies of military men, not having permanent interests and attachments in the community to be avoided." Lee said to avoid a military and regulations that render local militias useless which ironically is exactly what the parent claims has happened.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Militias of the size and role that they had in the 18th and 19th century do not exist anymore in the US. At the time, they were the essential means for American defense.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: The definition of [militia](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/militia) includes "the whole body of able-bodied male citizens declared by law as being subject to call to military service." [Almost all](https://www.sss.gov/Registration-Info/Who-Registration) male U.S. citizens and male immigrants, who are 18 through 25, are required to register with Selective Service.
1.3.1.3.1.1. Con: If one were to use this definition in the context of the 2nd amendment, carrying guns would have nothing to do with well-regulated militias and the amendment would be a non-sequitur
1.3.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Founder [Richard Henry Lee](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Henry_Lee) wrote the militia includes, "all men capable of bearing arms ... it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them."
1.3.1.3.1.1.2. Con: The founders believed that proficiency at arms contributes to a well regulated militia so it's a reasonable sequitur to add, "the right of the people to bear arms shall not be infringed." There's no evidence that the Second Amendment is a non-sequitur. The amendments were carefully crafted by thoughtful authors.
1.3.1.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.1.1.
1.3.1.3.1.3. Pro: Founder [James Madison](http://www.madisonbrigade.com/library_bor_2nd_amendment.htm) wrote, "a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people trained to arms, is the proper, natural and safe defence of a free state".
1.3.1.3.1.4. Pro: In Presser v. Illinois, [Justice Woods](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/116/252/) wrote, "It is undoubtedly true that all citizens capable of bearing arms constitute the reserved military force or reserve militia of the United States... \[no state may\] prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms so as to deprive the United States of their rightful resource for maintaining the public security"
1.3.1.3.1.5. Pro: [Kates writes](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=133113085074065112103127065107029112006064056058069029104004017119110007112028125067098033019101022122010127084076082064102112059052014001081099125025064064122116100018049010096029096122095009100074013098080116071007111067019124103025029025093101025103&EXT=pdf), "if they focus on the amendment's wording
at all, it is only on the word 'militia,' assuming that the Framers meant 'militia' to refer to 'a particular military force,' i.e., the states' home reserve, now federalized as the National Guard.  In fact, though not unknown in the 18th Century, that usage was wholly secondary to the one Webster classifies as now least used. 'The whole body of able-bodied male citizens declared by law as being subject to call to military service.'"
1.3.1.3.1.5.1. Pro: If we are all the militia, then the government is granted the right to regulate arms for everybody where the 2nd amendment states "well regulated militia." This is an astute point, but it contradicts your overall claim.
1.3.1.3.1.6. Pro: [Malcolm writes](http://www.constitution.org/mil/maltrad.htm), "for all able-bodied men there was also the civic duty to bear arms in the militia" and "every American colony formed a militia that, like its English model, comprised all able-bodied male citizens."
1.3.1.3.1.7. Pro: [Kopel writes](http://www.davekopel.org/2A/LawRev/Great-gun-control-war-20th-century.pdf), "In 1903, the same year that Congress established the modern organized militia as the National Guard, Congress also acted to bolster training for the unorganized militia-defined by statute as all able-bodied males aged eighteen to forty-five, with a few exceptions. See 10 U.S.C. § 311 \(2006\)."
1.3.1.3.1.8. Pro: 10 USC Ch. 12: THE MILITIA §246 [states](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/246), "The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age... The classes of the militia are \(1\) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and \(2\) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia."
1.3.1.3.1.9. Pro: [John F. Kennedy said](http://quotes.liberty-tree.ca/quote_blog/John.F..Kennedy.Quote.B160), "Although it is extremely unlikely that the fear of governmental tyranny, which gave rise to the 2nd amendment, will ever be a major danger to our Nation, the amendment still remains an important declaration of our basic military-civilian relationship, in which every citizen must be ready to participate in the defense of his country. For that reason I believe the 2nd Amendment will always be important."
1.3.1.3.1.9.1. Con: John F. Kennedy's beliefs do not usurp the authority of the US Constitution. Only the court has the authority to review and amend constitutional law.
1.3.1.3.1.10. Pro: [Rakove writes](https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?httpsredir=1&article=3289&context=cklawreview), "the concept of the militia had a fixed and consensually accepted meaning in ordinary usage, so that it was essentially coterminous with the free adult male population physically capable of bearing arms; and if the
language of the Constitution is not to be rendered completely plastic, modern interpretation has to preserve that meaning."
1.3.1.3.1.11. Con: If the militia consists of all people, than that clearly reinforces the state's power to regulate all weapons because the amendment clearly grants the power to the government to regulate said militias.
1.3.1.3.1.12. Con: If the 2nd Amendment is intended to maintain the militia, and the militia is all able-bodied men, then the right of women and the elderly to own guns is not explicitly protected by the 2nd amendment
1.3.1.3.1.13. Pro: In "Firearms Law and the Second Amendment", the authors [write](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008R1DZUQ/ref=kinw_clar_choose1?_encoding=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0), "eligible voters was very similar to the class of persons liable to perform militia duty - namely, free white adult males."
1.3.1.3.2. Con: The continued existence of the [Selective Service](https://www.sss.gov/Registration-Info/Who-Registration) is evidence that many people consider the American militia is still essential for national defense.
1.3.1.3.3. Con: The fact that there were roughly the [same number](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2016/02/back-iraq-us-military-contractors-return-droves/126095/) of civilians as soldiers deployed in the Iraq war is evidence that the militia is still essential for American defense. Some contractors were in support roles, but "the CIA and other intelligence agencies still use contractors ... for paramilitary services. The number of those contractors, some who are closer to the battlefield than the military advisors, is classified and unknown to the public."
1.3.1.3.3.1. Con: The idea of a "well-armed militia" was to counter the US government, in case it ever went against its people. The CIA, a government organisation, hiring contractors, is not what the founding fathers had in mind when putting the "well-armed militia" into the 2nd Amendment. Thus the CIA using contractors, is not a good argument for a militia being enabled via the 2nd Amendment.
1.3.1.3.3.1.1. Con: A militia of civilians was conceived for two purposes. One was to counter the need for a federal standing army which might oppress the people and the other was to ensure ample manpower to defend the nation when needed. The use of civilians to supplement the military, defending national security interests, is exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when writing "a well regulated militia being necessary for the security..."  PMCs are a perfect example of why civilians need arms.
1.3.1.3.4. Pro: Militias were essential for defense because America's standing army was [largely disbanded](https://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-u-s-armed-forces) after the Revolutionary War.
1.3.1.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.2.
1.3.1.3.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.3.
1.3.1.4. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.
1.3.2. Pro: The phrase "well regulated militia" was intended to mean something similar to our current [National Guard](http://prospect.org/article/well-regulated-militia). It didn't mean that everyone should have a gun for self defense. We already have a National Guard, so the Second Amendment is no longer needed.
1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.5.
1.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.7.
1.3.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.8.
1.3.2.4. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.9.
1.3.2.5. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.3.
1.3.3. Pro: The Second Amendment has to be understood in its historical context which involved militias - which don't exist anymore.
1.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.3.3.2. Pro: The founding fathers [imagined](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed29.asp) a militia as "little, if at all, inferior to \[the military\] in discipline and the use of arms" and on eye-level with it. Such a militia does not exist in the US.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Even if armed, many Americans could hardly put up much of a fight [for physical reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity_in_the_United_States). In most states, a quarter to a third of adults are obese; another third of the population is overweight.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: Most Americans are not obese and even one-third of Americans would still vastly outnumber any military force on Earth.
1.3.3.2.1.2. Con: While physical fitness is helpful in combat situations, the primary purpose of firearms is to compensate for physical disparities. The American obesity rate is further justification for more people to own firearms.
1.3.3.2.1.3. Pro: The fatness of Americans is already [posing a problem](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/10/15/too-fat-to-fight-military-threatened-by-childhood-obesity.html) for military recruiting as overweight and obesity reduce the pool of candidates capable of joining.
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: James Madison [spoke of](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed46.asp) the militia as a force for which it "may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by \[...\] regular troops".
1.3.3.2.2.1. Con: America has over 300 million guns. James Madison was not wrong when he [wrote](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed46.asp), an oppressive army "would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops."
1.3.3.2.2.2. Con: In America, there are 1.3 million [troops](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/22/us/is-americas-military-big-enough.html) but among civilians there are 20 million military [veterans](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/11/10/the-changing-face-of-americas-veteran-population/) including 5 million veterans under the age of 50. As Hamilton [wrote](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed29.asp), these civilians form "a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior... in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens" as long as civilians have the right to bear arms.
1.3.3.2.2.2.1. Con: Since 1788, the disparity between military grade weapons and civilian small arms has grown to the point that no body of civilians, regardless of size, could possibly defend against a military attack.
1.3.3.2.2.2.1.1. Con: The current trend is towards asymmetrical warfare, where larger weapons of mass destruction are not as useful in fighting the opposing forces.  In asymmetrical warfare the technology disparity is not as relevant as the total count of participants.
1.3.3.2.3. Pro: Alexander Hamilton [spoke of](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed29.asp) the militia as troops for which it would be "necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year" to ensure at least a minimum of capability and preparedness. This does not happen in the US.
1.3.3.2.3.1. Con: The [USTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academi#United_States_Training_Center) operated by Academi in North Carolina is the largest private firearms training center in the world. USTC offers tactics and weapons training to military, government, and law enforcement agencies as well as several open-enrollment courses periodically throughout the year for civilians.
1.3.3.2.3.2. Con: Hamilton [wrote](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed29.asp), "the project of disciplining ALL the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious" \[emphasis mine\]. Hamilton was advocating, for a "select core" of militia that would assemble often and would develop "a tolerable expertness in military movements" because that "is a business that requires time and practice." Hamilton was describing [privatized military](https://www.amazon.com/Corporate-Warriors-Privatized-Military-Industry/dp/0801474361) groups which does happen in the US.
1.3.3.2.3.3. Con: Hamilton considered the militia to include every able bodied man, not just the men disciplined in the use of arms. In [The Farmer Refuted](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-01-02-0057), Hamilton estimates the size of the militia response to a foreign invasion by "computing the number of men, capable of bearing arms in any nation, is by taking a fifth part of the whole people. By the best calculations we are supposed in America, to exceed three millions. The fifth part of three millions is 600,000."
1.3.3.2.4. Pro: American gun owners are not necessarily qualified to use their guns. [About 40%](http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/24/2/161) report not having received any formal training. In most cases, this training covered safety and gun handling but not necessarily actual combat.
1.3.3.2.4.1. Con: A [majority](http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/24/2/161) of US firearm owners have received formal firearm training. Over 125,000 certified [NRA](https://home.nra.org/about-the-nra/) instructors train about 1,000,000 gun owners a year. Nearly 6,000 people annually compete in NRA National Matches which is one of the biggest sporting events held in America. More than one million youth are also participating in NRA shooting events.
1.3.3.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.2.2.
1.3.3.2.5. Con: The "[Privatized Military Industry](https://www.amazon.com/Corporate-Warriors-Privatized-Military-Industry/dp/0801474361)" encompasses hundreds of companies, thousands of civilians, and billions of dollars. Such firms have participated in wars in Africa, Asia, the Balkans, and Latin America. They have become a key element in U.S. military operations. They are not considered significantly inferior to the military in discipline or use of arms.
1.3.3.2.6. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.3.1.
1.3.3.2.7. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.4.1.
1.3.3.2.8. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.2.1.
1.3.3.2.9. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.2.2.
1.3.3.2.10. Pro: Permissive as American gun regulation may be, the limitations it imposes on gun ownership make it hard to imagine that armed civilians could effectively counter military forces.
1.3.3.2.10.1. Pro: Although legal, it is [very difficult and highly expensive](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/its-still-legal-to-own-a-machine-gun-its-also-extremely-difficult-and-especially-expensive) to acquire fully-automatic weapons in the US. In contrast: the standard rifles of most American soldiers - [such as the M4A1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_carbine#M4A1), are fully-automatic.
1.3.3.2.10.1.1. Con: While it is difficult and expensive to legally purchase fully-automatic weapons in the US, the [STEN gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sten) proved that it's not difficult or expensive to construct a machine gun anywhere that has a rudimentary machine shop.
1.3.3.2.10.1.2. Con: Despite the expense of legally owning fully-automatic weapons, the ATF reports there are [630,019](https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/docs/undefined/firearms-commerce-united-states-annual-statistical-update-2017/download) registered machine guns in the US. That means, civilians own 1 machine gun for every 2 active duty soldiers.
1.3.3.2.10.1.3. Con: While it is expensive to own fully-automatic weapons in the US, machine guns are widely available [for rent](https://www.smokinggunsd.com/firearms/machine-guns.html) making it possible for large numbers of the militia to train using fully-automatic weapons.
1.3.3.2.10.2. Con: There are many examples of armed civilians fighting effectively against military forces, from one-on-one encounters such as [Ben Kanahele](http://www.historynet.com/the-niihau-incident.htm) in Niihau to 100,000 civilians in [Private Military Companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_military_company) in Iraq.
1.3.3.2.10.3. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.10.1.1.
1.3.3.2.10.4. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.10.1.2.
1.3.3.2.10.5. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.10.1.3.
1.3.3.2.10.6. Con: Civilians can buy a tank for about [$50,000](https://www.wired.com/2015/06/heres-can-buy-russian-tank/) plus shipping and permits. Before bringing a civilian tank into the US, someone "cuts a hole in the cannon" but such a tank would still be useful in battle and would afford civilians the opportunity to train on the maintenance and operation of a tank.
1.3.3.2.10.6.1. Con: The type of [training](http://www.benning.army.mil/armor/eARMOR/content/issues/2012/SEP_OCT/Articles/1-81_Armor_19KOSUT_SO12.pdf) required to successfully operate a tank is far beyond the means of most people.
1.3.3.2.10.6.2. Con: A tank without a gun, is pretty useless and no threat on the battlefield, especially when you are facing tanks with guns, modern, Hellfire missiles shot from Predator drones, anti tank rockets and close air support, like A10s.
1.3.3.2.10.6.3. Con: There is a reason why that tank costs 50k, because it is useless in modern warfare.
1.3.3.2.10.6.3.1. Pro: Because this version of the tank is outdated, Russia developed the [T-14 Armata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-14_Armata).
1.3.3.2.10.6.4. Con: This kind of tank has no defensive measures, besides its armor, which can easily be penetrated by modern weaponry.
1.3.3.2.10.6.5. Pro: Due to its armor, even a tank without an operational cannon still has some defensive value in battle.
1.3.3.2.10.6.6. Pro: Having learned to operate a tank without a functional cannon, civilians would be better prepared to operate fully functional tanks if some were acquired during battle.
1.3.3.2.10.7. Con: The U.S. military has a horrible track record of winning fights against armed insurgencies, all of which have had vastly inferior equipment to the U.S. military.
1.3.3.2.10.7.1. Con: All of these armed insurgencies took place on foreign soil, where America was unfamiliar with the terrain, customs, and/or language of the people they were fighting. This wouldn't be true in an American insurgency.
1.3.3.2.10.7.2. Pro: After two decades of fighting a Taliban insurgency for control over Afghanistan, the United States is generally not seen as a victor and oftentimes described [as losing ground](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/03/afghanistan-war-helmand-taliban-us-womens-rights-peace).
1.3.3.2.10.7.3. Pro: America proved largely unable to achieve its goals in Vietnam and saw South Vietnam fall in 1975, in part because of its inability to deal with insurgencies.
1.3.3.2.10.8. Con: If expected to fire upon American civilians en mass, some of the U.S. military personnel would desert, thus reducing military strength.
1.3.3.2.10.9. Con: If the executive branch decided to exterminate 300,000,000 citizens with tanks/helicopters/nukes, they would have no economy left to stand on and would quickly be conquered by another world power. There is no incentive for the government to go against the majority.
1.3.3.2.10.10. Pro: We can witness how well an armed resistance against an extremely advanced army works in Israel, it doesn't.
1.3.3.2.10.10.1. Pro: Palestinians have no shortage of RPGs, ammunition and AK47s and still do not stand any chance against Israel.
1.3.3.2.10.10.1.1. Con: Palestinians continue to exist and they continue to attack Israel so obviously they are not powerless against Israel.  While they may eventually lose the war, the Palestine weapons have inflicted damage on Israelis.
1.3.3.2.10.10.1.1.1. Con: The damage they have inflicted over the years is negligible.
1.3.3.2.10.10.1.1.1.1. Con: They have caused Israel to live in a state of war and caused significant trauma, even if not a lot of physical damage.
1.3.3.2.10.10.1.1.2. Con: But causing a bit of damage was not the goal of the Palestinians. The goal was to achieve independence, freedom and their own land and state. This looks ever more realistic to achieve.
1.3.3.2.10.11. Pro: We can witness how well Hezbollah fared against Israel, when they attacked, invaded and occupied Lebanon.
1.3.3.2.10.12. Pro: We can witness how well the Kurds have fared against the Turks. They have never been able to establish their independent country within the border of Turkey.
1.3.3.2.10.13. Pro: We know, how during the Breakup of Yugoslavia the ex Yugoslavian army was only stopped from invading Slovenia and dominating the other countries, after the US / NATO started intervening and taking out their heavy equipment via air bombardment.
1.3.3.2.10.14. Pro: We know how even a pretty well equipped Iraq army, was twice easily squashed by US military might.
1.3.3.2.10.15. Pro: We know how Afghanistan, a very hard place to invade, with loads of armed militias, was successfully invaded, and the Taliban government toppled.
1.3.3.2.10.15.1. Con: ISAF and the US have given up and are reducing trops in Afghanistan.
1.3.3.2.10.15.1.1. Con: This is not due to them not being able to control it, but that the cost vs benefits of controlling it are too low.
1.3.3.2.10.15.1.2. Con: This is due to the idea of bringing democracy to Afghanistan having been shown to not being possible.
1.3.3.2.10.16. Pro: Even if a sufficiently large advanced 21st century military could never force an armed civilian population to surrender, they could definitely subdue them to the point where they would successfully control and occupy the country, bending the will of the civilian population to do as the military wants.
1.3.3.2.10.17. Pro: As modern armed forces are moving towards autonomous fighting machines, humans will become less and less effective at fighting [them](https://www.kialo.com/autonomous-fighting-machines-the-future-of-warfare-486/486.0=486.1+486.475).
1.3.3.2.11. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.3.3.
1.3.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.5.
1.3.3.4. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.
1.3.4. Con: The Second and Third Amendments have prevented abuses from inception to the modern day, and are therefore not anachronistic.
1.3.5. Con: The third amendment, while very specific in its jurisdiction, protects an aspect of freedom of privacy and property, like the fourth amendment does.  While both could be reworded to be more broad in definition, they still retain the spirit of significant rights; the people's right to tools of self defense, and the people's right from property confiscation/use by the government.
1.3.6. Pro: The Amendment is a product of its time. It refers to firearms that were far less powerful than what is widely available today.
1.3.6.1. Con: The framers of the Second Amendment were well aware of the previous advancements in weapons systems; i.e. stones to spears to swords to bow and arrows to gunpowder and the resulting muskets of their day. They had to know there would be great advancements and inventions of fire power in the future. Much as we know there will be great future advancements in computer tech and artificial intelligence.
1.3.6.2. Con: Yet the Framers wanted to guarantee to the American people the same level of firepower as the contemporary military powers of the time. A single shot musket in the late 18th century was at least the equivalent of an AR-15 today. The 2nd Amendment is therefore not conditioned upon the destructive power of the arms in question.
1.3.6.2.1. Con: If the Framer's intent was matching the level of firepower, then the 2nd amendment guarantees citizens' ownership of nuclear weapons as well. The danger this alone [presents](https://science.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-bomb8.htm) is a good reason to repeal or amend the amendment.
1.3.6.2.1.1. Con: The danger posed by nuclear weapons is not a good reason to repeal the Second Amendment because even with the Second Amendment, the materials used in a nuclear weapon are already, heavily regulated.
1.3.6.3. Con: There are multiple examples of weapons closer to the firepower of today that the Founders knew about.
1.3.6.3.1. Pro: Pepper box revolvers could hold over 20 rounds and were developed hundreds of years before the founding fathers.
1.3.6.3.2. Pro: The Puckle gun \(early gatling gun\) was created 60 years before the revolutionry war.
1.3.6.3.2.1. Con: The Puckle gun was [nothing but a prototype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puckle_gun) that never saw combat usage and production on a large scale. It is unlikely that it made much of an impression on the framers of the Constitution, assuming they even knew about it.
1.3.6.3.3. Pro: The girandoni rifle, where a 22 capacity magazine could be fired within 30 seconds was created during the revolutionary war.
1.3.6.3.4. Pro: The belton flintlock developed during the revolutionary war that could fire 20 or so rounds in 5 seconds with one pull of the finger.
1.3.6.4. Con: The variety of weapons in existence at that time and the failure of the founders to specify single-shot muskets or similar indicated their belief that all types of weaponry were valid for personal ownership.
1.3.6.4.1. Con: The amendment doesn't state that. It doesn't evaluate different types of weapons. It grants the power to the state. The framers could not have foreseen all possibilities. Their intent was to protect the right to bear arms, but to allow the state to regulate the availability of arms. This gives the government the power to limit ownership of weapons. For example, nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons are restricted from the general public due to the nature of devastation they can cause.
1.3.6.5. Pro: The 2nd amendment doesn't protect the ownership or availability of certain types of firearms. It grants regulatory power to the state. It only protects your right as a citizen to bear arms that are made available through government regulation.
1.3.6.5.1. Con: It could be interpreted that regulations of firearm ownership is undermining \(infringing\) the "right to bear arms".
1.3.6.6. Con: The 2nd amendment allowed citizens to own [cannons](http://www.1812privateers.org/United%20States/PRINCE/usmarq.html) and even Gatling Guns \(after their invention\) these weapons were much stronger then single-shot muskets. It stands to reason that modern firearms would still be protected just the same.
1.3.6.6.1. Con: The potential lethality of today's most dangerous weapons could not have been foreseen when the constitution was written. The framers granted the power to the government to regulate the militia \(which inherently includes firearms\) in the 2nd amendment. Therefore, you cannot deduce that the writers of the constitution would allow all weapons today. Otherwise, why would they have granted the power of oversight to government?
1.3.6.7. Con: The Amendment was written in the context of an era during which guns were widely available and gun ownership was very common.
1.4. Pro: The Second Amendment's precise meaning is too unclear for it to be of use.
1.4.1. Con: The lack of clarity might be justification for revising the Second Amendment but doesn't support repealing the Second Amendment.
1.4.2. Con: If so, then the "pursuit" of "happiness" is also too poorly defined and nebulous to be consdered valid.
1.4.2.1. Con: The phrase ‘the pursuit of happiness’ does not appear in the constitution. It’s from the Declaration of Independence, the legal substance of which separated us from Britain’s colonial empire but did not establish for this new country a body of laws.
1.4.3. Pro: The meaning of terms like "militia" has been [a subject of debate and disagreement](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/10/politics/what-does-the-second-amendment-actually-mean-trnd/index.html) - even among experts - for a long time.
1.4.3.1. Pro: In the District of Columbia v. Heller ruling from 2008, justices disagreed about whether the term "militia" refers to all male, able-bodies citizens within a certain age range \([Justice Scalia](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/opinion.html)\) or only to citizens doing service in a state-organized militia \([Justice Stevens](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/dissent.html)\).
1.4.3.1.1. Con: In the District of Columbia v. Heller ruling, Justice Scalia and [Justice Stevens](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/dissent.html) disagreed as to whether the "right to keep and bear arms to encompass use or ownership of weapons outside the context of service in a well-regulated militia." They expressed no disagreement whether the term "militia" referred to all citizens or not. The court has always recognized "the militia" to be all able-bodied citizens.
1.4.3.2. Con: There seems to be consensus among the Supreme Court upon the definition of the term, "militia".
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: In DC v. Heller, dissenting [Justice Stevens](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/dissent.html) wrote, "the words 'the people' in the Second Amendment refer back to the object announced in the Amendment’s preamble. They remind us that it is the collective action of INDIVIDUALS HAVING A DUTY TO SERVE in the militia..." Stevens asserts "the people" excludes people "outside the context of service" but confirms the militia is all "individuals having a duty to serve."
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.4.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Experts on the Second Amendment like Joyce Lee Malcolm argue that there is no agreement on what sort of militia the framers [had in mind](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=j4ZnFy3f8sAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=To+Keep+and+Bear+Arms:+The+Origins+of+an+Anglo-American+Right&hl=ko&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdrL2ywebbAhWBmJQKHXIuDPQQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=To%20Keep%20and%20Bear%20Arms%3A%20The%20Origins%20of%20an%20Anglo-American%20Right&f=false) \(p. 136\) and that the meaning of the term is "[by no means clear](http://www.constitution.org/mil/maltrad.htm)".
1.4.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.6.
1.4.4. Con: While there is no consensus on the meaning of the Second Amendment, the Supreme Court interpretation has been very clear; gun ownership is an individual right.
1.4.4.1. Con: [Since District of Columbia v. Heller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller#Dissenting_opinions) was a 5-4 decision, it illustrates that there is no actual consensus about the meaning of the Second Amendment. Even the justices could not agree on the meaning of the Second Amendment.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: In the District of Columbia v. Heller ruling from 2008, the Supreme Court [acknowledged](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/opinion.html) in its ruling "very different interpretations of the Amendment" among its members.
1.4.5. Pro: The Second Amendment has been described by scholars as producing an "amazing range of", "varying", "very different" and "competing interpretations" \([Lee Malcolm, p. 136](https://books.google.de/books?id=j4ZnFy3f8sAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=To+Keep+and+Bear+Arms:+The+Origins+of+an+Anglo-American+Right&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-rY2y5cHcAhXnBsAKHePCA_kQ6AEILDAA#v=onepage&q=To%20Keep%20and%20Bear%20Arms%3A%20The%20Origins%20of%20an%20Anglo-American%20Right&f=false); [Beeman, p. 82](https://books.google.de/books?id=A4y1h_AbwC4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Penguin+Guide+to+the+United+States+Constitution:+A+Fully+Annotated&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjr38rX5sHcAhVLecAKHYddDnAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=The%20Penguin%20Guide%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution%3A%20A%20Fully%20Annotated&f=false); [Hudson, p. 55](https://books.google.de/books?id=MCy2zFfD6yYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Handy+Law+Answer+Book&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKxYLi5sHcAhUjBcAKHSQQB30Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=The%20Handy%20Law%20Answer%20Book&f=false); [Uviller/Merkel, p. 5](https://books.google.de/books?id=abAwWcOeFjkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Militia+and+the+Right+to+Arms,+or,+How+the+Second+Amendment+Fell+Silent&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiS9JTu5sHcAhVGVsAKHdxsCAAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=The%20Militia%20and%20the%20Right%20to%20Arms%2C%20or%2C%20How%20the%20Second%20Amendment%20Fell%20Silent&f=false); [Harcourt, p. 145](https://books.google.de/books?id=xJIUCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Guns,+Crime,+and+Punishment+in+America&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiE8vv35sHcAhWJIMAKHWMjBScQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Guns%2C%20Crime%2C%20and%20Punishment%20in%20America&f=false)\).
1.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.1.1.
1.4.7. Con: The First Amendment has also been debated for a long time. Many believe it protects hate speech and many believe it doesn't. Just because something is debated doesn't mean the whole thing should be banned.
1.5. Pro: The 2nd amendment is already effectively meaningless. "Arms" is a much larger category than it was in 1791. We already prohibit citizens from owning the vast majority of military arms, from RPGs to tanks, jets, missiles, and the list goes on. So the 2nd amendment is already being selectively ignored. The true debate and question should be about what level of arms control we want for our citizens. The right to bear arms is already limited.
1.5.1. Con: Many items listed here are [not actually prohibited](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_II_weapons). They may be purchased if the purchaser acquires the appropriate license and pays a yearly tax.
1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.6.6.
1.5.3. Pro: It is [illegal](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/guide/atf-national-firearms-act-handbook-atf-p-53208/download) to transfer or possess a machine gun made after May 19, 1986.
1.5.3.1. Con: While it is true that it is illegal to transfer a fully automatic weapon that was manufactured after may 19,1986, it is completely legal to own and transfer fully automatic weapons made BEFORE May 19, 1986. Those weapons are highly prized and buying one legally is VERY expensive, but it can be done as long as the person passes the background check and has the $200 tax stamp for it or is a [Class 3 weapons dealer.](http://www.oldglorygunsandammo.com/nfa-class-iii-weapons/)
1.5.4. Con: If the 2nd Amendment were "effectively meaningless", then it would not have been cited as the main argument by the plaintiff's lawyer and been the first point in the decision of the Supreme Court during [District of Columbia v. Heller](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZS.html).
1.6. Con: The Second Amendment secures fundamental rights and is part of America's social contract between government and citizens
1.6.1. Pro: Repealing any Amendment from the actual Bill of Rights would set a dangerous precedent, deeming the most basic rights of a U.S. citizen reversible.
1.6.1.1. Con: There is precedent for repealing amendments based on public wishes as opinion evolves e.g. 21st amendment repealing the 18th during the prohibition. Evolution of thinking on gun control is no different, as the abilities of weapons are vastly superior now compared to when the amendment was first written
1.6.1.1.1. Con: The technical capabilities of arms is irrelevant in that you’re still not justifying why an American’s right to defend themselves should be given up.
1.6.1.1.1.1. Con: This is a straw man arguement. No-one is advocating for Americans to give up the right to defend themselves, this is not the purpose of the second amendment anyway.
1.6.1.1.1.1.1. Con: In DC v. Heller the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment ensures civilians can be armed for personal self defense. The Second Amendment bolsters the security of person.
1.6.1.1.2. Con: Though amendments have been added and repealed, we've never amended the original ten Bill of Rights. Breaking that barrier could redefine what it means to be American, potentially in a good way... but potentially in a very dangerous way. It would be more beneficial to discuss the proper interpretation of the second amendment, acknowledging that our right to bear arms is intrinsically tied to the security of the state, which indicates a common goal: reducing needless violence.
1.6.1.2. Con: This is a typical slippery slope argument.
1.6.1.2.1. Con: This may be so, but the point remains that our Bill of Rights hasn't been amended. We'd take a pretty large risk by changing one of the original ten amendments. Our right to speak freely, refuse soldiers form barging into homes, etc. might be the next targets for change. It would be more beneficial to discuss the second amendment's inherent claim, that our right to bear arms is intrinsically tied to the security of the state, and this indicates a common goal: reducing needless violence.
1.6.1.3. Con: Fallacy of precedent and slippery slope. We have repealed one amendment, prohibition, and that precedent has not since been followed. The rules for passing an amendment are such a high standard that repealing other amendments which protect basic freedoms is highly unlikely, thus negating the slippery slope. The ability to amend laws is not a negative as you suggest. The government requires the ability to adjust laws to stay relevant.
1.6.2. Pro: [Justice Steves writes](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/dissent.html), the Second Amendment contains "both a duty and a right to have arms". The amendment is not just about a right but it also serves to "remind us that it is the collective action of individuals having a duty to serve in the militia". Repealing the Second Amendment would eliminate that reminder of the peoples' duty to serve.
1.6.2.1. Con: The second amendment does not imply a duty. It states that a well-regulated militia is necessary to protect the nation. That is not a requirement to 1\) serve or 2\) own weapons.
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.9.
1.6.4. Con: Following [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract#John_Locke's_Second_Treatise_of_Government_\(1689\)), the social contract stipulates that people respect and obey the government in exchange for safety and prosperity. The Second Amendment undermines this social contract as it makes America unsafe.
1.6.4.1. Pro: The Second Amendment and the right it protects enables much violence in the US.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: More people are killed in car accidents than by a gun. More than twice the amount people are killed by [alcohol](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics) than by guns every year. Even more are killed by tobacco, yet there is no call to ban any of those.
1.6.4.1.1.1. Con: And yet sales of alcohol and tobacco can legally be restricted, and car ownership subject to licensing, background checks and assessments of competency unlike guns. When the cultural values at the time demanded both an amendment banning and subsequent repealing of alcohol consumption, The People were allowed a vote. Why should Guns be any different?
1.6.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The ownership of firearms IS legally restricted and subject to licencing and background checks.
1.6.4.1.1.2. Con: Campaigns for the stricter regulation or even banning of tobacco products have a history that spans decades.
1.6.4.1.1.3. Con: The number of traffic deaths has been [steadily sinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year#/media/File:US_traffic_deaths_per_VMT,_VMT,_per_capita,_and_total_annual_deaths.png) for decades thanks for increasing safety standards and regulation. The issue of traffic deaths is therefore successfully being dealt with whereas the [number of handgun homicides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Ushomicidesbyweapon.svg) is on the same level as in the 1970s and 1980s \(although it has been higher since then\).
1.6.4.1.1.3.1. Con: A [more comprehensive look](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/07/gun-homicide-rate-down-49-since-1993-peak-public-unaware/) shows that both crime and gun homicides have decreased significantly since the 1970s and 1980s.
1.6.4.1.2. Pro: There is a correlation between gun ownership rates and gun violence and gun deaths.
1.6.4.1.2.1. Pro: Long term studies in the US indicate that rates of gun ownership and firearm homicide rates [rise in tandem.](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2013.301409?journalCode=ajph)
1.6.4.1.2.1.1. Con: The article is incorrect. [According to the CDC](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/07/chapter-2-firearm-deaths/), firearm homicides peaked in 1993 at 7 per 100,000. By 2010 it had dropped to 3.6 per 100,000. [As of 2015, it is at 4 per 100,000](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm). Interestingly, the number of guns in the US has risen dramatically from 173 million in 1981 to 393 million in 2018. If your claim was true, we should have seen a drastic increase in the gun related homicides rate, not a lower rate.
1.6.4.1.2.2. Pro: Across US states, those with higher rates of gun ownership in general also have [higher rates of gun deaths](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/pro-gun-myths-fact-check/).
1.6.4.1.2.3. Con: By observing the higher intentional homicide rates in other countries, we can see the negative effects of restrictive gun laws. According to the UN, the countries with the highest intentional homicide rates are; #1-El-Salvador \(82.84\), #2-Honduras \(56.52\) and #3-Venezuela \(56.33\). By comparison to those countries, the US has very lax gun control laws and an intentional homicide rate of 5.25 per 100,000 which puts the US at #87 on the list. [El Salvador](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/el-salvador) [Honduras](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/honduras) [Venezuela](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/venezuela)
1.6.4.1.3. Pro: Research comparing US states with each other points towards an [inverse correlation](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/01/the-geography-of-gun-deaths/69354/) of gun control - for examples assault weapons bans and trigger lock requirements - and gun deaths.
1.6.4.1.3.1. Con: All American states are subject to the provisions of the Second Amendment. These gun control measures can apparently be implemented without violating the Second Amendment. Thus, lower rates of gun deaths and the existence of the Second Amendment do not exclude each other.
1.6.4.1.4. Con: Repealing the Second Amendment is unlikely to change the prevalence of gun violence in the US as the weapons used for this violence are already out there.
1.6.4.1.4.1. Con: There are various examples for gun buyback programs through which the number of guns was reduced, for example [in Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_buyback_program#Australia) between 1996 and 2003.
1.6.4.1.4.2. Con: Over time, those guns will fall apart and need to be repaired. Without a place to repair them, they will become useless.
1.6.4.1.5. Con: Repealing the Second Amendment will not solve the issue of violence in the country or even lessen it by a extremely large degree. If you take away one of many methods of causing harm and pain, there are still many methods of causing harm and pain.
1.6.4.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.
1.6.4.1.5.2. Con: This opinion is not supported by international experience with gun control \(vis. [Australia](http://andrewleigh.org/pdf/GunBuyback_Panel.pdf), [UK](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/firearms-act-twenty-years-on-has-it-made-a-difference-dunblane-port-arthur-a8110911.html)\). Countries with largely similar cultural backgrounds and values to the USA have instituted gun control measures with a subsequent decrease in firearm related homicides and suicides.
1.6.4.1.5.3. Pro: Tools of violence, in fact, can be an effective deterrent of violence.
1.6.4.1.5.3.1. Pro: The concept of [Mutually Assured Destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction) has helped prevent the outbreak of global war in the nuclear age.
1.6.4.1.5.4. Pro: [In April 2018 the murder rate in London surpassed the murder rate in New York for the first time.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/03/londons-murder-rate-higher-than-new-york-citys/480860002/)

Britain has no constitutional protections for firearms, and has very strict gun control.
1.6.4.1.5.4.1. Con: This data is unlikely to be representative of a larger trend and merely points towards exceptional months. In 2017 in total, New York City had [almost three times](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43628494) as many murders as London. The differences in the ten years prior to that were even more pronounced.
1.6.4.1.5.4.2. Con: New York is hardly representative for the rate of gun violence in the US as a whole. Dozens of major US cities have [much higher murder rates](https://www.thetrace.org/2018/04/highest-murder-rates-us-cities-list/) then New York.
1.6.4.1.5.5. Con: Firearms are one of the easiest and most effective ways to kill. You only have to pull a trigger. This action requires less mental engagement, so it is more likely to be used than other methods. Banning this killing method will make it harder for someone to commit a crime, and that may discourage him from doing so.
1.6.4.1.5.6. Pro: In some Asian countries with strict gun laws, deadly [knife attacks](https://bigthink.com/dragons-and-pandas/years-of-the-knife-nil-the-stabbing-culture-in-east-asia) are common.
1.6.4.1.5.6.1. Con: All of these attacks would have been more deadly if the attackers had used a gun.
1.6.4.1.5.7. Con: Repealing the second amendment will not eliminate all violence, but mitigating some of it is still a worthwhile endeavor.
1.6.4.1.5.7.1. Con: Changing the tool used to do violence does not mitigate violence.
1.6.4.1.5.7.1.1. Con: It does when the new tool is significantly less effective at causing harm, and this is the case with guns compared to other weapons.
1.6.4.1.6. Pro: America suffers from more and worse mass shootings than other countries.
1.6.4.1.6.1. Pro: A third of all mass shootings with a minimum of four victims between 1966 and 2012 took place in the US and led, on average, to more victims than elsewhere \([Lankford, p. 176](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01924036.2015.1105144?needAccess=true)\).
1.6.4.1.6.1.1. Pro: The study emphasizes that America's lax gun regulations allow perpetrators to acquire multiple guns which commonly increases the number of victims \([Lankford, p. 180](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01924036.2015.1105144?needAccess=true)\).
1.6.4.1.6.1.2. Pro: In similar research that spans the same time period and a total of 171 countries, 90 mass shootings took place in the US. Only four other countries reached double-digits: The Philippines, Russia, Yemen and France, none of which had more than 18 mass shootings \([Lankford, p. 192](https://search.proquest.com/docview/1797309887?rfr_id=info%3Axri%2Fsid%3Aprimo)\).
1.6.4.1.7. Pro: The United States has a [far higher rate of gun homicides](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/upshot/compare-these-gun-death-rates-the-us-is-in-a-different-world.html) than other rich Western countries, even when adjusted for differences in population size.
1.6.4.1.7.1. Pro: America's gun homicide rate is [25 times as high](https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343\(15\)01030-X/pdf) as that of other populous, high-income countries. For 15- to 24-year olds, it is even 49 times as high.
1.6.4.1.7.1.1. Con: A [true representation](https://mises.org/wire/mistake-only-comparing-us-murder-rates-developed-countries) of homicide statistics should include all homicides in all countries, not just gun-related homicides or just "populous, high-income countries".
1.6.4.1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.6.4.1.7.1.1.
1.6.4.1.7.3. Pro: Some countries where gun ownership is illegal have a [rate of less than 1 homicide per 100 000 inhabitants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate). That rate in the USA is of 5.35 per 100 000, higher than in most of the developed countries. The rate of 1/100 000 is not an utopy, so the US should take measures in order to reach it. They should take example on those countries with illegal gun ownership and low homicide rates.
1.6.4.1.8. Con: The majority of firearm crimes are committed by those that [illegally possess firearms](http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2018/mar/12/john-faso/do-illegal-gun-owners-commit-most-gun-crime-rep-fa/). Therefore, repealing the 2nd amendment would specifically target legal firearms owners without providing a response to those that illegally possess firearms and the violence caused by them.
1.6.4.1.8.1. Con: Prohibition of guns would reduce the amount of guns in circulation. The illegal gun markets would also fall apart.
1.6.4.1.8.1.1. Con: Prohibition of any good [drives demand for a black market solution to supply what the open market does not](http://www.nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-85-number-5/globalization-us-black-market-prohibition-war-drugs-and-case-mexico).
1.6.4.1.8.1.1.1. Con: Unlike some other illegal products, gun production requires more technologies and machines. It makes it more difficult to produce illegal guns.
1.6.4.1.8.1.1.1.1. Con: Anyone with $500-$1,000 can reliably manufacture firearms on their own with [devices like the GhostGunner](https://ghostgunner.net/collections/featured-products/products/ghost-gunner-2-deposit) or any other [CNC milling machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control). This is comparable in price and complication to the stills of alcohol prohibition and grow setups for illegal marijuana cultivation.
1.6.4.1.8.1.2. Con: Illegal gun markets would probably become more prevalent, as eliminating the private supply of guns would be next to impossible. There are inherent logical problems in enacting such legislation when [more guns are owned privately than by law enforcement](http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2017/08/robert-farago/trace-civilians-70-times-guns-u-s-police-military-combined/).
1.6.4.1.8.1.2.1. Con: This is exactly why it should not be made possible that citizens own more guns than law enforcement.
1.6.4.1.8.1.2.2. Con: If it was illegal to sell guns to citizens, the gun factories would dramatically reduce their production. Less supply means less illegal sales.
1.6.4.1.8.1.2.2.1. Con: [Illegal sales largely take place between individuals](https://gun.laws.com/illegal-guns/illegal-guns-statistics), not between firearms manufacturers and individuals. Restricting the legality of manufacturing does not solve the problem of the private trade and sale of already owned weapons, [as Australia has found out](https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/78dxzg/we-asked-australians-where-they-got-their-illegal-guns).
1.6.4.1.8.1.3. Pro: Illegal gun markets are very rare in other developed countries with strict gun regulations.
1.6.4.1.8.1.3.1. Con: [Black markets exist everywhere](http://reason.com/archives/2016/08/23/in-europe-terrorists-arm-themselves-on-t) [there are laws](https://reason.com/archives/2016/03/22/australias-gun-buyback-created-a-violent) [restricting ownership of firearms](http://www.gunpolicy.org).
1.6.4.1.9. Pro: Firearms are by nature killing machines that are more efficient and easy to use than other weapons. This makes crimes easier and deadlier despite that guns can also be used for defense.
1.6.4.1.10. Pro: The second amendment is the main underlying reason for the US's perplexingly high homicide rate, and the only underlying reason for the outrageous number of mass killings.
1.6.4.1.10.1. Pro: According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate), the US has a far higher homicide rate than Canada, for instance.
1.6.4.2. Con: [Locke argued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract#John_Locke's_Second_Treatise_of_Government_\(1689\)) that a government's legitimacy comes from the citizens' delegation to the government of their absolute right of violence \(reserving the inalienable right of self-defense or "self-preservation"\). The Second Amendment protects the right of self-defense.
1.6.4.3. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.1.1.1.
1.6.4.4. Pro: In terms of safety, America lacks behind other nations of comparable wealth.
1.6.4.4.1. Pro: The homicide rate in the US is [about 30% higher](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=BLI) than the average of OECD nations and far ahead of that in countries with a comparable level of wealth.
1.6.4.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.1.7.
1.6.5. Con: The right protected by the Second Amendment clashes with other, more fundamental rights and interests.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Article 3 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) affirms every person's "right to life, liberty and security of person".
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.1.
1.6.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.1.1.1.
1.6.5.1.3. Pro: As the comparison with other high-income countries shows, safety in the US is relatively low. American men are nine times as likely to be a homicide victim than men in other OECD countries, women four times as likely as women in other OECD countries \([Grinshteyn/Hemenway, p. 270/1](https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343%2815%2901030-X/abstract)\)
1.6.5.2. Pro: The [letter of transmittal](http://constitutionus.com) that accompanied the draft of the constitution described "prosperity, felicity, safety" as the purpose of "the consolidation of our Union". The Second Amendment undermines the safety of Americans.
1.6.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.1.
1.6.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.1.1.1.
1.6.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.1.3.
1.6.5.3. Con: The right protected by the Second Amendment helps provide for "the security of a free state" which is one of the more fundament rights and interests of the nation.
1.6.5.3.1. Con: Living in a country where anyone around you may own a gun is not really a secure situation as defined by a 'state of being free from danger or threat', because guns make crimes more likely to happen. A country where no civilian owns a gun is therefore much more secure.
1.6.5.3.1.1. Con: While some may trade freedom for security, America has typically sided on the side of freedom.
1.6.5.3.1.1.1. Con: When a violent person owns a gun, he is more likely to hurt or kill more people than he would without a gun. This breaks the fundamental freedom of living for the victims.
1.6.5.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The breaking of the law \(murder\) does not infringe on rights because it is already illegal.
1.6.5.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: That it is illegal doesn't mean that it won't happen. Justice is done after a crime is committed, but that won't save the victim.
1.6.5.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Crime breaks the freedom of living,  beyond the scope of laws and legal rights.
1.6.5.3.1.2. Pro: It's like running through a mine field. It's not as secure as running through an empty field.
1.6.5.3.1.2.1. Con: A mine field creates a zone where people would not want to cross. Those on either side would feel more secure from each other as crossing the field would be deadly.
1.6.5.3.1.2.1.1. Con: The "mine field" in the parent claim was a metaphor: the mines represent armed people and the field represent the country. Living in a country full of armed people is dangerous for the same reasons that camping in the middle of a mine field is dangerous.
1.6.5.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: A mine is an unthinking indescriminate explosive. An armed person both can think for themself and act rationally and legally.
1.6.5.3.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: An armed person may not think rationally and legally when under the effect of drugs.
1.6.5.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: A person under the effects of drugs that would impair rational and legal thought cannot legally carry a firearm.
1.6.5.3.1.2.2. Con: Crossing a minefield is not safe but people don't install minefields to run through them. Minefields are installed for security and they provide much greater security than an empty field.
1.6.5.3.1.3. Con: There is no state truely free from danger or threat.
1.6.5.3.1.3.1. Con: While we can't truly be free from danger or threat, we should take any reasonable action that would get us as close as possible to this state.
1.6.5.3.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.1.7.3.
1.7. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.1.
1.8. Pro: The Second Amendment prevents the government from enacting laws that protect their citizens from gun violence.
1.8.1. Con: The Fourth Amendment prohibiting unreasonable search and seizure also prevents states from enacting laws \(e.g. stop-and-frisk\) that protect citizens from gun violence.  So do the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th amendments. All the amendments limit government in some way but that's not a reason to repeal any of them.
1.8.2. Con: The second amendment doesn't prevent states from restricting [gun access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_law_in_the_United_States) \(the "violence" mentioned in the parent\), as evidenced by [various laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state).
1.8.3. Con: Gun violence is not the only form of violence "preserved" by the second amendment.
1.8.4. Con: There is an assumption with this statement that gun control laws prevent violence. This is unsupported.
1.8.4.1. Con: This is not unsupported. The experience with comparatively affluent nations with similar demographic backgrounds who have enacted stricter gun control policies have shown [decreases in gun violence and deaths](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/4/16418754/gun-control-washington-post).
1.8.5. Con: The Second Amendment does not allow the right to bear ammunition. States could outlaw the [sale](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-should-regulate-bullets/2016/01/06/62de9322-b3dc-11e5-a76a-0b5145e8679a_story.html?utm_term=.8872e5486fed) and [possession](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/12/no-really-regulate-the-bullets/266332/) of bullets without repealing the amendment.
1.8.5.1. Con: Banning ammunition would be unconstitutional for at least one of two reasons. First, [ammunition](http://www.constitution.org/leglrkba.htm) is generally considered to be "arms". Second, even if ammunition is not considered to be arms such a ban would still be an infringement on the right to "bear arms". The government cannot restrict piecemeal what the Constitution forbids them to restrict wholesale.
1.8.5.2. Con: The opinions expressed in the Washington Post and The Atlantic do not seem to have any legal basis. There's no legal precedence or legal argument which suggests the Second Amendment does not protect ammunition.
1.9. Pro: The Second Amendment has racist origins.
1.9.1. Pro: The thirteenth Amendment should also have struck out the second amendment, because the right to bear arms as part of a well regulated militia's primary purpose was [to keep slaves from rebelling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/02/22/what-the-second-amendment-really-meant-to-the-founders/?utm_term=.63d24f1517f0).
1.9.2. Pro: At the time of the writing of the Bill of Rights, the [historical meaning](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/02/22/what-the-second-amendment-really-meant-to-the-founders/?utm_term=.38c9d96c0149) that was implied by the words "right to bear arms" was specifically to the exclusion of African Americans and other oppressed peoples like Native Americans. The reason the bill was passed was so that whites could protect themselves from these "other people.
1.9.2.1. Con: The constitution in that time would have applied only to US citizens, most of whom were likely white, whereas most non-whites were likely not citizens \(being either slaves or under the jurisdiction of their own nations/tribes\); this interpretation could likely be due to a coincidence of sovereignty.
1.9.3. Con: Just because something has its origins in the slavery era and was based on racism does not mean that it should be abandoned. Many things overcome their origins and are today of independent value.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Both the White House and the Capitol building were built [with the help of slaves](https://www.whitehousehistory.org/questions/did-slaves-build-the-white-house) and on the basis of American racism. Yet there is no debate about tearing them down.
1.9.4. Con: The lawful interpretation of the 2nd Amendment is not racist, so its origins have no effect on the merit of the amendment.
1.9.5. Con: Militias did indeed originate in a time when the biggest threat to the community was thought to be conflict with, say, Native Americans. By the revolution, though, the context had changed: now the militia was tasked with fending off a foreign government. After ratification, the 2nd Amendment was meant to limit the power of the new Federal government. Then, after the Civil War, supporters of the 14th Amendment sought to extend this right to black freedmen seeking defense from racist mobs.
1.10. Con: Gun ownership is a fundamental part of being an American.
1.10.1. Con: What it means to be American is not fixed and always evolving. An America without the Second Amendment is therefore by no means impossible or unimaginable.
1.10.1.1. Pro: It was a fundamental part of being an American to be able to drink alcohol until the 18th Amendment, then it wasn't, then it was again after the passing of the 21st Amendment. The same could happen for the 2nd Amendment - it could be repealed, and not owning a gun would be part of the national identity of "Being an American"
1.10.2. Con: There is a tradition of gun ownership, but a larger number of Americans [do not own guns](https://www.statista.com/statistics/249740/percentage-of-households-in-the-united-states-owning-a-firearm/). To claim that gun ownership is fundamental to being an American is exclude the majority of Americans.
1.10.2.1. Con: What is part of being an American is the freedom to buy and own guns, not necessarily the actual ownership.
1.10.2.1.1. Con: The freedom to buy/own guns is only part of being American for some people right now because it is currently legal. The fact that something is currently legal is not an argument to keep it legal.
1.10.3. Pro: Gun ownership is a way for Americans to feel connected to the nation's historical roots, since firearms played an important role in the creation of the country as it is known today.
1.10.3.1. Con: To claim that elements of America's past are worth preserving because it keeps people connected to the nation's roots is problematic. By the same logic, the continuation of racism could be justified.
1.10.3.2. Pro: The British attempt to confiscate firearms and gunpowder from the Colonists was a [key catalyzing factor](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1967702) in the American Revolution; and without their firearms, it is unlikely that the Colonies would have ever won the war and gained their independence from Great Britain.
1.10.3.3. Pro: Firearms were an essential element of Manifest Destiny and westward expansion.
1.10.3.3.1. Pro: In the 18th and 19th centuries, the [Native American gun trade](https://books.google.com/books?id=BJRJZZIxrmkC&pg=PR8&lpg=PR8&dq=the+role+of+guns+in+westward+expansion&source=bl&ots=XvgOw2z1gQ&sig=a-iacedXqyNM6skP_3YVCrjaeiU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWiKOjpu_bAhXPqFkKHV9wDos4ChDoAQhTMAo#v=onepage&q=the%20role%20of%20guns%20in%20westward%20expansion&f=false) burgeoned as American, British, and French forces sought to leverage Native alliances against one another as they fought for territory beyond the original colonies.
1.10.3.3.2. Pro: Prior to colonization, the West was full of vast expanses of dangerous and uncharted wilderness; therefore fur-trappers, traders, explorers, and other frontiersmen needed to carry firearms in order to ensure their safety.
1.10.3.3.3. Pro: [Gunslingers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunfighter) and gun-toting cowboys were a staple of the American Old West, and remain prominent in global mainstream media as a symbol of American history and culture.
1.10.3.3.4. Con: Contrary to popular thought, many municipalities in the Old West enforced [stricter gun control regulations](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gun-control-old-west-180968013/) back then they do today.
1.10.3.3.4.1. Pro: Aside from the 2nd Amendment, most gun-control regulations were passed on the [local level](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gun-control-old-west-180968013/) and typically mandated that visitors turn their weapons over to law enforcement upon entering town. In exchange, the officer would give them a token that would need to be returned in order to get their gun back when leaving.
1.10.4. Con: A subjective definition of what it means to "be an American" is not a valid defense of gun ownership.
1.10.5. Con: Repealing the Second Amendment does not mean removing the right to buy and own guns. It simply means removing that clause from the Constitution. There is no clause in the Constitution that protects the right to own a car or possess alcohol, but we still retain those rights.
1.10.5.1. Con: If our rights are not listed and protected by the Constitution, we run the risk of a tyrannical government eliminating them. Basically, the anti-federalist argument for the Bill of Rights. There is also the issue of the Second Amendment being a response to British abuses of the colonists. They decided to never again give up their "right" to arm themselves as a deterrent to tyranny.
1.11. Pro: Other countries allow their citizens to own and use guns for self-defense and sports without a constitutional guarantee like the Second Amendment.
1.11.1. Con: The constitution is harder to change than are laws and regulations. The Second Amendment therefore ensures that the government cannot easily take away the right to keep and bear firearms from citizens.
1.11.2. Con: If other countries allow gun ownership without a constitutional guarantee and if the USA would continue to allow gun ownership without a constitutional guarantee then there's no reason to bother repealing the constitutional guarantee as it doesn't seem to matter.
1.11.2.1. Con: Repealing the 2nd Amendment would allow lawmakers to restrict the possession, use, and features of firearms, which would save lives.
1.11.3. Con: Other countries do not have a list of enumerated rights just for being alive.
1.11.4. Pro: Only [three countries](http://www.businessinsider.com/2nd-amendment-countries-constitutional-right-bear-arms-2017-10) in the world currently have a constitutional right to own a gun: the US, Mexico, and Guatemala.
1.12. Pro: The version of the Bill of Rights sent to the states to be ratified [contained a typo](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/01/most-consequential-comma/426894/) that completely changes the literal context of the second amendment. It is entirely possible that, technically speaking, the exact second amendment text used today in the US constitution was never actually ratified by the states.
1.12.1. Con: The supposed comma error does not effect the meaning of an individual's right to bear arms.
1.12.2. Con: The text of the 2A, was ratified by the several states with the commas in question, and thus is and was legally binding.  Whether Jefferson thought the commas ought to have been placed elsewhere or removed is moot.
1.12.3. Pro: The amendment's use of [commas](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/opinion/16freedman.html?_r=0) makes it ambiguous as to whether the focus is on protecting militias or protecting every individual citizen's right to bear arms.
1.13. Pro: The amendment says that a well-regulated militia is necessary for the security of a free state. The right to bear arms is based on that assumption. But the assumption is clearly wrong, since there hasn't been a well-regulated militia in the US for quite a while. So how can it be necessary? The amendment is factually incorrect.
1.13.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.13.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.
1.13.3. Pro: Australia, just as one of many examples, is a free state, and guns are virtually entirely banned there. If the [current Supreme Court interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller) of the second amendment is correct, then Australia proves the 2nd amendment wrong.
1.13.3.1. Con: [Blackstone](http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/freestate.pdf) wrote, "nothing... ought to be more guarded against in a free state, than making the military power... a body too distinct from the people." That opinion was enshrined in the 2nd Amendment. A state's freedom might be secure but it's not as secure as it could be if the right to keep and bear arms is reserved to the military and excluded from the people. It's an opinion, not something which can be proven right or wrong.
1.13.3.1.1. Con: This would imply that Australia's freedom is hanging by a thread. It is not.
1.13.3.1.2. Con: In the quoted article, Blackstone also states that the military in Absolute Monarchies serve to protect the monarch's interests/position and the country from foreign powers, and are a separate "profession" from citizens. The Armed Forces in modern times serve a democratically elected executive and are drawn from citizenry, therefore negating the preconditions that Blackstone set for the Second Amendment to be necessary to keep a state "secure". It is an anachronistic argument which is not upheld
1.13.3.2. Con: Neither the [Second Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) nor the [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller) have claimed a free state cannot exist if guns are banned.  The Second Amendment claims that a well-regulated militia is necessary for security.  It does not claim an individual right to bear arms is necessary for security.  The Second Amendment protects the individual's right to bear arms for the purpose of \(but not limited to\) producing a well-regulated militia.
1.13.3.2.1. Pro: The [Supreme Court held](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller#Decision), "The Amendment’s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause."
1.13.3.2.2. Con: If you can't have a secure and free state without a well-regulated militia and you can't have a well-regulated militia without a right to bear arms, then you can't have a secure and free state without a right to bear arms.
1.13.3.2.2.1. Con: It's possible to maintain an effective military without a civilian militia. The government could form a well-regulated militia exclusively from professional men-at-arms. However, The founders rejected a "select corps of militia" instead [stating](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Henry_Lee), "a militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves...all men capable of bearing arms". Due to the decision to rely on a civilian militia, the founders specifically stated government shall not infringe on the people's right to arms.
1.13.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.3.2.2.1.
1.13.3.3. Con: Australia is a free state, but is not as secure in that status as the USA.
1.13.4. Con: -> See 1.13.3.1.
1.13.5. Con: America's [militia](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/militia) has been called upon many times. There are currently over [1.3 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces) members of the [unorganized militia](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/246) who have volunteered for active service to protect the security of our free state.
1.13.5.1. Con: They could have volunteered without previously owning weapons. This is called basic training.
1.13.6. Con: It is the ability of the people to form a militia separate from any level of government that secures freedom. Removing this freedom will not cause an immediate reduction of other freedoms, but the second amendment is to protect future generations, not either side of the current political divide.
1.13.7. Con: Reasoning that since there has not been a well-regulated militia in the US for "quite a while" isn't a solid basis for suggesting it won't be necessary.
1.13.7.1. Con: Plenty of other states manage to stay free and secure without a well-regulated militia. Thus, there is little reason to assume that it commonly becomes necessary.
1.13.8. Con: if you look at all the countries that have had a military coup and installed a military dictator, the idea of an armed populace protecting their freedoms becomes much more understandable. The current total military strength of the US is [2.83 million](https://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=united-states-of-america#manpower). However, the number of households with a gun is estimated to be around [50 million](https://gunculture2point0.wordpress.com/2017/02/02/how-many-households-in-america-today-have-guns/). However, many households own more than one gun and there is[more than 1 gun for every person in the US](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/there-are-more-guns-than-people-in-the-united-states-according-to-a-new-study-of-global-firearm-ownership/?utm_term=.8321ac6f7e81). This means a military coup in the US could never succeed.
1.14. Con: The right to bear arms is essential to protect a free society against external as well as internal threats.
1.14.1. Con: By this logic, most countries with far stricter gun laws should not be free and democratic. Yet many of the countries with far stricter gun laws are thriving democracies.
1.14.1.1. Pro: According to the [Freedom in the World Index](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world-2018-table-country-scores) by Freedom House, dozens of countries with stricter gun laws than the US are considered more free.
1.14.1.2. Pro: In fact, many countries with strict gun laws look more democratic than the US. In Economist's Democracy Index, the US is not even part of the "full democracy" group, whereas twenty-one other countries are \([EIU, p. 5](http://www.eiu.com/Handlers/WhitepaperHandler.ashx?fi=Democracy_Index_2017.pdf&mode=wp&campaignid=DemocracyIndex2017)\).
1.14.1.3. Con: Most countries with stricter gun laws are less free than America. According to the [Freedom in the World Index](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world-2018-table-country-scores) by Freedom House, the United States currently ranks 55th out of 210 countries.
1.14.1.3.1. Con: According to this index, most countries of the [Western European and Others Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_European_and_Others_Group) \(against which the US is most often compared\) have a better freedom score than the United States despite their strict gun regulations.
1.14.1.3.2. Con: Correlation does not imply causation, there could be many other reasons why there are fewer freedoms. E.g. the US absolutist approach to freedom of speech.
1.14.1.4. Con: At the same time, there are also examples of democracies with an unarmed populace that slowly degraded into tyranny \(Germany being one example\). There are no examples of this happening when the populace was armed.
1.14.1.4.1. Con: The presence of guns would not have saved Germany from turning into a dictatorship as large parts of the population were welcoming this development.
1.14.1.5. Con: The logic is faulty. The right to bear arms does not guarantee a perfect democracy, but provides a significant obstacle to tyranny. Democracies without the right to bear arms are not a contradiction, they are just vulnerable.
1.14.1.5.1. Pro: Many of history's [most brutal regimes](https://freedomoutpost.com/gun-control-dictator-style-tyrants-who-banned-firearms-before-slaughtering-the-people/) banned or confiscated private firearms prior to committing genocidal acts, implying that such weapons in the hands of the populace could have helped prevent these acts from happening in the first place.
1.14.1.5.1.1. Pro: [Targeted firearm confiscation](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/little-gun-history/) of populations deemed dissident or rebellious was enforced under the regime of Josef Stalin, which left millions vulnerable to imprisonment and death as a result of the Soviet [collectivization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivization_in_the_Soviet_Union) attempt.
1.14.1.5.1.2. Pro: In 1915 the Young Turks enacted a set of measures against the Armenians [including an order](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/ref/timestopics/topics_armeniangenocide.html) to hand over any owned weapons to the authorities. Those who owned them were transferred to labor camps where they were either killed outright or died of overwork, while the remaining Armenians were left unarmed to defend against the genocide that ultimately claimed 1.5 million lives.
1.14.1.5.1.3. Pro: During the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, private firearms were [confiscated and transferred](http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/F-Working-papers/SAS-WP4-Cambodia.pdf) to the stockpiles of the regime, which went on to kill between 1.5 and 3 million Cambodians.
1.14.1.5.1.4. Pro: The [1938 Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_legislation_in_Germany#Gun_regulation_of_the_Third_Reich) enacted by the Nazi Party deprived all Jews living within the Third Reich and occupied territories of possessing any kind of weapons, including knives, firearms, and ammunition.
1.14.1.5.1.4.1. Con: It is unlikely that an armed population would have made a difference in Nazi Germany. Jews made up [less than one percent](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005276) of the population; and the wider public supported the Nazi's repression and persecution of Jews.
1.14.1.5.1.5. Con: Plenty of other governments heavily restricted gun ownership without turning against their population or becoming tyrannical. A government's gun policies are therefore no bellwether.
1.14.1.5.1.5.1. Pro: Gun regulation in Japan [has been described](http://www.guncite.com/journals/dkjgc.html) as "the most stringent in the democratic world", yet the country has been a stable democracy for decades.
1.14.1.5.1.5.2. Pro: Australia [significantly tightened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Firearms_Agreement) gun regulations in 1996 and implemented a mandatory buyback program for some gun types. Yet the country has remained a stable democracy.
1.14.2. Con: There is no example in history in which the freedom of an established democracy was saved from tyranny by a significant contribution from armed civilians.
1.14.2.1. Con: The Second Amendment states the militia \(not "armed civilians" outside of the military\) is necessary to secure freedom. The founders implored civilians to use arms [especially when young](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Henry_Lee), and be the militia, prepared for military service, if needed. There are many examples in history where freedom was saved from tyranny by a civilian militia called to active military service.
1.14.2.1.1. Pro: In 1939, [Karel Pavlík](http://americaninprague.eu/history/Nazi-Germany.shtml) commanded a company of armed Czechoslovakian citizens \(the 12th machine-gun company of the 8th Infantry Regiment\) that fought against Nazi tyranny in the town of Místek. Even though that battle was lost, the resistance and allied forces eventually won the war, driving the Nazis out of Místek.
1.14.2.1.2. Pro: By the year 1939, over [1.5 million](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/britain_wwtwo/ff1_conscription.shtml) men from Britain's [militia](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/militia) were called up to active service to fight for freedom against Nazi tyranny.
1.14.2.2. Con: In light of the attacks of [9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/911_attack), and due to Saddam Hussein's previous attacks on the freedom of Americans, US military forces along with over 100,000 civilians armed with privately owned weapons, working in [Private Military Companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_military_company), successfully toppled Hussein's tyrannical regime.
1.14.2.2.1. Pro: Talking about the reason for the Iraq war, the [President said](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=73139), "We're concerned that Iraq is exploring ways of using these UAVS for missions targeting the United States.... Now, as before, we will secure our nation, protect our freedom..." UN inspectors [reported](http://www.un.org/depts/unmovic/documents/UNMOVIC%20UDI%20Working%20Document%206%20March%2003.pdf), "Iraq has declared that in 1988 it considered RPVs as a delivery vehicle to spray Biological Warfare agents" and "Iraq developed a remotely piloted MIG possibly to be equipped with a spray tank for the delivery of a BW agent".
1.14.2.2.2. Pro: In 2002, Congress [passed](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ243/html/PLAW-107publ243.htm) the "Authorization of use of Military Force Against Iraq" listing 23 reasons including "Iraq persists... to engage in brutal repression of its civilian population thereby threatening international peace and security in the region" and "to remove from power the current Iraqi regime and promote the emergence of a democratic government" and "it is in the national security interests of the United States to restore international peace and security to the Persian Gulf region".
1.14.2.2.2.1. Pro: The 2002 act passed the [Senate](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/107-2002/s237) 77-23 and passed the [House](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/107-2002/h455) 296-133.
1.14.2.2.3. Pro: Hussein planning an attack or even bluffing of an attack is a threat to national security whether Hussein actually had the capability to carry out an attack or not. Michael Schrage [wrote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2003/05/11/no-weapons-no-matter-we-called-saddams-bluff/0be893f3-f877-44d9-84b2-5f580266213e/?utm_term=.ef59bde02ca0), "Iraq's WMD threat remained credible for more than 20 years because that's precisely what Hussein wanted the world to believe. After all, he had successfully deployed chemical weapons against both Kurds and Iranians. He'd earned his credibility."
1.14.2.2.4. Con: There is no evidence whatsoever that Iraq ever posed a threat to the US, its freedom or political institutions.
1.14.2.2.4.1. Pro: The [British Iraq Inquiry](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36721645) by a number of politicians, diplomats and historians found in hindsight that estimates of the threat posed by Iraq were largely based on faulty intelligence and that the country didn't pose any immediate threat.
1.14.2.2.4.1.1. Con: While stating the threat was not imminent, the [British Iraq Inquiry](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36721645) noted, "military action might have been necessary later" and acknowledged, "Iraq has continued to produce chemical and biological agents" and "Iraq had the means to deliver chemical and biological weapons" even though Iraq hadn't yet weaponized the agents.
1.14.2.2.4.1.1.1. Con: All claims regarding chemical and biological and nuclear weapons, were wrong. The threat, was not a threat.
1.14.2.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con: There was no imminent threat of chemical, biological or nuclear attack but there was a threat of an attack. Hussein had attempted to assassinate a former US President. Hussein took Americans hostage. Al-Qaeda attacked with razor blades. Hussein didn't need WMDs to be a threat.
1.14.2.2.4.2. Con: In 1993, the Washington Post [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/iraq/timeline/062793.htm?noredirect=on), "U.S. Navy ships launched 23 Tomahawk missiles against the headquarters of the Iraqi Intelligence Service... in what President Clinton said was a 'firm and commensurate' response to Iraq's plan to assassinate former president George Bush". President Clinton said, "We will combat terrorism. We will deter aggression. We will protect our people."
1.14.2.2.4.3. Con: Politico [reports](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/bush-announces-launch-of-operation-iraqi-freedom-march-19-2003-236134), "A post-invasion investigation by the Iraq Survey Group concluded that Iraq had ended its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs in 1991 but that it intended to resume production if sanctions were lifted."
1.14.2.2.4.3.1. Con: But the sanctions were never intended to be lifted.
1.14.2.2.4.3.2. Con: This proves, that at the point in time, they had no WMDs. The hypothetical of the future is just that, a hypothetical, nobody knows what will happen in the future.
1.14.2.2.4.4. Con: UN Security Council Resolution [687 stated](https://peacemaker.un.org/iraqkoweit-resolution687), "aware of the use by Iraq of ballistic missiles in unprovoked attacks" and "concerned by the reports in the hands of Member States that Iraq has attempted to acquire materials for a nuclear-weapons programme".
1.14.2.2.4.5. Con: President Clinton [stated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Liberation_Act), "Iraq admitted, among other things, an offensive biological warfare capability… \[Hussein\] will then conclude that he can go right on and do more to rebuild an arsenal of devastating destruction. And some day, some way, I guarantee you he'll use the arsenal."
1.14.2.2.4.6. Con: In 1990, in violation of American freedom, Saddam Hussein's regime took hundreds of Americans hostage. The intent was to use them as bargaining chips and forestall any military action against Iraq.  Deputy Chief [Joseph Wilson](https://adst.org/2015/07/freeing-american-hostages-in-the-first-gulf-war/) found "115-120 that were identified as human shields."
1.14.2.2.4.7. Con: -> See 1.14.2.2.4.1.1.
1.14.2.2.4.8. Pro: A [Senate committee report](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/06/world/middleeast/06intel.html) into the lead-up to the Iraq War concluded that the government's assessment of the threat posed by Iraq was overstated and based on faulty intelligence.
1.14.2.2.4.8.1. Pro: The head of the committee [argued that](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/05/AR2008060501523.html) "the American people were led to believe that the threat from Iraq was much greater than actually existed", a process he [characterized as](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rockefeller-bush-duped-public-on-iraq/) "deliberately cynical manipulation".
1.14.2.2.4.9. Con: President [Bush said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/12/september11.usa2), "I am often asked why we are in Iraq when Saddam Hussein was not responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The answer is that the regime of Saddam Hussein was a clear threat. My administration, the Congress, and the United Nations saw the threat - and after 9/11, Saddam's regime posed a risk that the world could not afford to take."
1.14.2.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.2.4.2.
1.14.2.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.2.4.3.
1.14.2.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.2.4.4.
1.14.2.2.8. Pro: With the passage of [HR 4655](https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/4655), Congress, "Urges the President to call upon the United Nations to establish an international criminal tribunal for the purpose of indicting, prosecuting, and imprisoning Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials who are responsible for crimes against humanity, genocide, and other criminal violations of international law."
1.14.2.2.9. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.2.4.6.
1.14.2.2.10. Con: The toppling of the Iraqi regime and the invasion of Iraq were not done by Private Military Companies but by [regular armed forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq).
1.14.2.2.10.1. Con: [Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq), "the coalition forces also received support from the Peshmerga in Iraqi Kurdistan." The Peshmerga were a local militia group which fought against the national military. The Peshmerga were under the control of regional, civilian political parties. [Rai writes](https://www.khaama.com/kurdish-peshmerga-can-be-a-game-changer-in-iraq-and-syria-6802/), "During the US-led invasion of Iraq the Peshmerga helped the United States in their mission to capture Saddam Hussein. They also captured Al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden’s messenger Hassan Ghul in 2004."
1.14.2.2.10.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.5.
1.14.2.2.10.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.3.
1.14.2.2.10.4. Con: [Isenberg writes](http://www.mafhoum.com/press9/279P2.pdf), "The increase in the use of PMCs has grown dramatically... during the first Gulf War in 1991 for every one contractor there were 50 military personnel involved. In the 2003 conflict the ratio was 1 to 10." Since 1970, "the increasing technical complexity of military equipment and hardware drove the Services to rely on contractors as technical specialists, and they worked side by side with deployed military personnel." For example, civilians helped operate missile systems.
1.14.2.2.10.4.1. Con: From your paper, as support personnel, not as fighters alongside US marines.
1.14.2.2.10.4.1.1. Pro: "Today contractor logistics support is routinely imbedded in most major systems maintenance and support plans. Unfortunately, military operational planners have not been able to keep up with the growing involvement of contractors"
1.14.2.2.10.4.1.2. Pro: "particularly in high technology positions, reliance upon increasingly complex technology, higher mission requirements, low military salaries, and recruitment shortfalls all within a booming economy and budgetary surplus projections."
1.14.2.2.10.4.1.3. Con: Civilians often provided security services on the ground. Isenberg writes, "the lack of security in post-war Iraq created an enormous demand for PMC services. At least ten to
fifteen cents of every dollar spent on reconstruction is for security," and "428 civilian contractors had been killed in
Iraq and another 3,963 were injured." That means civilians with guns were fighting in Iraq.
1.14.2.2.10.5. Con: In 2004, [Singer wrote](https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/14132/PP4_Singer.pdf), "PMFs provide a range of tactical military roles on the ground, supplementing the currently over-stretched coalition forces. An estimated 6000 of the private contractors carry out armed roles" and "even helped operate combat systems like the Patriot missile batteries in the Army and the Aegis defence system on board numerous U.S. Navy ships."
1.14.2.2.11. Con: The weapons used by PMCs in Iraq are fully automatic assault rifles - weapons that cannot be privately purchased or owned in the US.
1.14.2.2.11.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.
1.14.2.2.11.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.10.1.2.
1.14.2.2.12. Con: PMCs are not a militia, esp. not as considered by the constitution.
1.14.2.2.12.1. Pro: PMCs are professional mercenaries, many of them ex army, doing this, for money. \([definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia)\)
1.14.2.2.12.1.1. Pro: From [Academi's](https://www.academi.com/pages/careers) \(ex Black Water\) webpage: "More than eighty percent of all ACADEMI employees are former military or law enforcement. "
1.14.2.2.12.1.2. Con: According to [Academi's](https://www.academi.com/pages/careers) web page, about 20% of their employees are not former military or law enforcement.
1.14.2.2.12.2. Pro: PMCs were not comprised of regular civilians that volunteered to help in Iraq.
1.14.2.2.12.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.2.12.1.1.
1.14.2.2.12.2.2. Con: -> See 1.14.2.2.12.1.2.
1.14.2.2.12.3. Pro: Militia, in a US constitutional context, does not comprise an expeditionary force that is flown to far away countries and invades them.
1.14.2.2.12.4. Pro: Militia, in a US constitutional context, constitutes a local, US, citizen's army, that would rise up against a corrupt US government.
1.14.2.2.12.5. Con: PMCs in the US are a local, US, citizens' army, that could rise up against a corrupt US government.
1.14.2.2.12.6. Con: Just like modern PMCs, the Militia, in the US constitutional context, were used as a supplemental military force which traveled as needed and fought the enemy [where needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privateer#United_States).
1.14.2.2.12.7. Con: PMCs were comprised of regular civilians that volunteered to help in Iraq.
1.14.2.2.12.7.1. Con: -> See 1.14.2.2.12.1.1.
1.14.2.2.12.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.2.12.1.2.
1.14.2.2.12.8. Con: [US News](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/erbe/2007/10/04/blackwater-pay-insults-the-military) refers to PMCs as "the paid militia." Just like modern PMCs, some members of the militia in early America were professional soldiers, many of them [ex-army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shepard), and were paid to provide military services. Many received [arms](http://www.stateoftheunionhistory.com/2016/06/1808-thomas-jefferson-militia-act-of.html) from the government.
1.14.2.2.12.9. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.8.
1.14.2.2.12.10. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.
1.14.2.2.13. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.2.4.9.
1.14.2.2.14. Con: According to [International Humanitarian Law](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule3), the moment a civilian is armed it is no more civilian anymore but a combatant.
1.14.2.2.15. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.2.10.5.
1.14.2.3. Con: Around [October 2013](https://www.rt.com/news/american-military-contractors-iraq-621/), the newly formed democracy in Iraq was fighting to free Fallujah from Al-Qaeda. Among the military and foreign civilian fighters in the region were 2,191 civilian Iraqis, working for the US Defense Department to defend freedom in Iraq. Following the US withdrawal from Iraq in 2014, the Iraqi government continued to use many of the same civilians to defend against Al-Qaeda.
1.14.2.4. Con: The lack of an example from history is hardly a reason to repeal a right guaranteed by the Constitution.
1.14.2.4.1. Con: The lack of an example in itself is not a reason to repeal the Amendment; but it undermines a reason for keeping it.
1.14.2.5. Con: That's because there is no example in history of a democratic government becoming tyrannical when the citizens were well-armed. There are multiple examples in history of a democratic government becoming tyrannical when the citizens were not well-armed.
1.14.2.5.1. Con: Nazi Germany was pretty tyrannical and the citizenry at the time was very well armed.
1.14.2.5.1.1. Pro: Some gun control was enacted during the Weimar Republic. This was specifically to PREVENT the fascists' rise to power, and Hitler's coup attempt of 1923 in Munich did in fact fail. He ultimately won democratically. [ir.lawnet.fordham.edu](https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/26/ben-carson/fact-checking-ben-carson-nazi-guns/&httpsredir=1&article=4029&context=flr) \(p.660\)
1.14.2.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.14.1.5.1.4.
1.14.2.5.1.3. Con: The 1928 Law on Firearms and Munitions and the 1938 German Weapons Act required that citizens have [permits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_legislation_in_Germany#History_of_firearms_restrictions_in_Germany) in order to acquire or carry a firearm, and there were additional regulations for who would qualify. This means that weapons were actually not easily accessible for much of the public.
1.14.2.5.2. Con: In 1941 the US government implemented [Japanese internment](https://www.britannica.com/event/Japanese-American-internment) which was, "the forced relocation by the U.S. government of thousands of Japanese Americans to detention camps".
1.14.2.6. Pro: Any example of armed citizens saving their democracy from tyranny does not support the second amendment if that country did not have an equivalent to the second amendment.

Such an example would actually demonstrates that the second amendment is unnecessary in order to protect democracy from tyranny.
1.14.2.6.1. Con: An example of armed citizens fighting tyranny does support the text of the Second Amendment which states that a well-regulated militia is necessary for the security of a free state. Even if the example doesn't support the need for the Second Amendment itself to exist, such examples do support the need for the principles in the Second Amendment to exist.
1.14.2.7. Pro: There are several examples in history in which armed civilians made some contribution to fighting tyranny.
1.14.2.8. Con: In 1941, retired lieutenant colonel [Napoleon Zervas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Zervas), while a civilian, organized a resistance group of Greek citizens. In 1942, Zervas' group began armed conflicts against Nazi tyranny. The resistance and allied forces eventually won the war, driving the Nazis out of Greece.
1.14.2.9. Con: In World War II, Hitler attempted to destroy England. Some British civilians picked up arms and defended their established democracy from Nazi tyranny.
1.14.2.9.1. Con: The Germans never stepped foot on British soil \(unless you count the channel islands, which they took without much resistance\). With the exception of the fighting in North Africa and later in France and Germany, Britain was only fighting with ships and planes. No British civilian fought in the war.
1.14.2.9.1.1. Con: [British civilians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Guard_\(United_Kingdom\)) unfit for military service were directly engaged in the fight in WWII. The Home Guard operated its own dedicated batteries of anti-aircraft guns and rockets plus coastal defense artillery as well as engaging German planes with their machine guns. They are credited with shooting down numerous Luftwaffe aircraft and the V-1 flying bombs. The Home Guard in Northern Ireland also took part in gun battles with the IRA. In total, 1206 of the Home Guard were killed in battle.
1.14.2.9.1.1.1. Con: "otherwise ineligible for military service" does not mean "ineligible for military service". The difference being that "otherwise ineligible" actually means eligible in at least one specific circumstance. The home guard was part of the military for all intents and purposes.
1.14.2.9.1.1.2. Pro: The [Home Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Guard_\(United_Kingdom\)) was made of civilians "too young or too old to join the services, or those in reserved occupations" or "otherwise ineligible" meaning they were not eligible. The members were civilian volunteers, not legally committed or required to serve in the Home Guard.  The members of the Home Guard were not members of the military.  The members of the Home Guard were armed civilians.
1.14.2.9.1.1.3. Con: The home guard did not own those anti-aircraft guns. So this case has nothing to do with the question whether civilians should be allowed to own guns, they didn't.
1.14.2.9.1.1.3.1. Con: The ownership of anti-aircraft guns in particular notwithstanding, the Home Guard had some [privately owned guns](https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2012/8/23/the-hession-rifle/) which means this case does have something to do with the question of whether civilians should be allowed to own guns. They did.
1.14.2.9.1.1.3.1.1. Con: The home guard did not use those privately owned guns to fight the Germans, which is why this is not a case of civilians successfully defending their country from tyranny with guns that they owned.
1.14.2.9.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The first plane shot down by the Home Guard was accomplished by [concerted rifle fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu7zC26z1CA), not anti-aircraft guns.
1.14.2.9.1.1.4. Con: They were fighting against WW2 weaponry, since then, weapon systems have significantly advanced and no simple weapon system has ever successfully downed a cruise missile, ICBM, 30000 feet bombing run or predator drones.
1.14.2.9.1.2. Con: British civilians were directly involved in the war and about [60,000](https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/civilian-casualties-of-world-war-two/) British civilians were killed.
1.14.2.9.2. Pro: The Nazi military invaded British air space, British waterways and British soil \(if you count the Channel Islands\).
1.14.2.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.9.1.1.
1.14.2.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.9.1.2.
1.14.2.10. Con: The irony is that you say that while living in a democracy saved from a tyrannical government by the private ownership of guns.
1.14.2.11. Con: In the [Battle of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Athens_%281946%29) the democracy of the town of Athens, Tennessee was saved from tyranny entirely by a group of armed civilians.
1.14.2.12. Con: In light of the attacks of [9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/911_attack), and due to Saddam Hussein's previous attacks on the freedom of Americans, US military forces along with over 100,000 civilians armed with privately owned weapons, working in [Private Military Companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_military_company), successfully toppled Hussein's tyrannical regime.
1.14.3. Pro: -> See 1.14.1.3.
1.14.4. Pro: The military defends against attacks. Without a military, a tyrannical invader might \(not "will"\) overrun a free society. The military comes from the militia \(by definition\). In the USA, the militia comes from civilians \(by law\). In order for civilians to be prepared for military service, civilians should be \(not "must be"\) proficient with some military-style \(not "military grade"\) weapons. In this way, the right to bear arms is fundamental to a free society and a deterrent to tyranny.
1.14.4.1. Con: This is called basic training, which one receives AFTER joining the military. Or the police department. Even during World Wars, there has always been time to train new recruits for war. Furthermore, the United States spends as much money on its military as the next six countries combined. If such military can't defend us, making a difference with civilians taking potshots at whatever is a pure fantasy.
1.14.4.1.1. Con: In 1941, Japanese Airman Shigenori Nishikaichi attacked the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, crash-landed on the island of Niihau, recruited the assistance of a local Japanese-American, disarmed the other civilians, took hostages, and burned a home trying to protect secret papers from Japan. At first the locals were compliant but after learning of the attack on Oahu, civilian [Ben Kanahele](http://www.historynet.com/the-niihau-incident.htm), armed with a knife \(and his wife Ella, armed with a rock\), killed the invader, stopping the attack.
1.14.4.1.1.1. Con: “Saved his community from Tyranny” May be an over exaggeration. The pleural of anecdote is not data, as there are several stories of military personnel behind enemy lines which would support or refute this view. The fact that he was subdued without a gun also supports the position that universal gun ownership is not required.
1.14.4.1.1.2. Pro: Even though he was a civilian, Ben Kanahele was awarded the [Purple Heart](https://digicoll.manoa.hawaii.edu/hwrd/Pages/viewtext.php?s=browse&by=title&route=browseby.php&tid=586), acknowledging Ben's injuries were the result of military combat.
1.14.4.1.1.3. Con: The Niihau incident doesn't relate to firearms but involves a stone and a hunting knife. "Arms" should be understood in the context of the Second Amendment where it certainly doesn't refer to stones and knives.
1.14.4.1.1.3.1. Con: Niihau residents had a shotgun and a pistol. The pilot also arrived with a sidearm and the plane had machine guns. The invader only succeeded in capturing all the firearms by enlisting the help of local, Yoshio Harada. [HistoryNet](http://www.historynet.com/the-niihau-incident.htm) noted that Harada was a "sell-out that would cost them–as well as the nation–dearly".
1.14.4.1.1.3.2. Con: The soldier and the civilians fought over control of the guns. It was the physical struggle for the shotgun in particular which gave Kanahele the opportunity to attack Nishikaichi. The fact the invader was ultimately vanquished using a knife rather than the shotgun, doesn't change the fact that armed civilians successfully defended the island.
1.14.4.1.1.3.3. Con: In the NY Times, Justice Stevens linked to "[United States v. Miller](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/307/174)" where the court noted that "arms" were any weapon of "ordinary military equipment," or ones that "could contribute to the common defense." In the context of the Second Amendment the court stated "arms" would have included pikes, bayonets, armor, swords, as well as "a good fixed musket".
1.14.4.1.1.3.4. Con: In an article for the UofM Journal of Law Reform, the authors [write](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/knives.pdf), "Knives are clearly among the 'arms' which are protected by the Second Amendment. Under the Supreme Court’s standard in District of Columbia v. Heller, knives are Second Amendment 'arms' because they are 'typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes,' including self-defense."
1.14.4.1.1.4. Con: Japanese Airman, Nishikaichi never posed a threat to freedom and democracy in the US.
1.14.4.1.1.4.1. Con: If the pilot did not wish to pose a further threat, the pilot could have surrendered to the people of Niihau. The fact that the pilot continued to attack the people of Niihau and attempted to return to the Japanese air force, indicates that the pilot intended to continue attacking America.
1.14.4.1.1.4.2. Con: [HistoryNet](http://www.historynet.com/the-niihau-incident.htm) notes, "Nishikaichi and seven other fighter pilots from the carrier Hiryu had attacked targets in southeastern Oahu. The fighters strafed the U.S. Naval Air Station on the Mokapu Peninsula and then hit Bellows Army Airfield, 10 miles to the south. In both attacks, bombing followed the strafing. The fighters then made another pass to hit additional targets of opportunity." This attack was a serious threat to the US.
1.14.4.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.14.4.1.1.4.1.
1.14.4.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.14.4.1.1.4.2.
1.14.4.1.1.7. Con: Knives are hardly of relevance as arms in the context of the Second Amendment as its repeal wouldn't affect the availability of knives.
1.14.4.1.1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.14.4.1.1.3.4.
1.14.4.1.1.8. Pro: The [New World Encyclopedia](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Militia#Definition) notes, "There is no minimum size to militia, and a solitary act of defense, including self-defense, can be thought of as one person calling up himself to defend the community, represented by himself or others, and to enforce the law."
1.14.4.1.2. Con: During WWII, over a million [STEN](http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/draw_pdf.php?filename=WW2_Sten_Gun_Article-.pdf) sub-machine guns were hastily manufactured and thousands were blindly air-dropped into Nazi occupied territories like Norway, to arm civilians fighting for freedom.
1.14.4.1.3. Con: Fortunately, civilians do not have to join the military in order to receive military training or buy military style weapons. Armed civilians can indeed make a difference fighting against military forces.
1.14.4.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.5.
1.14.4.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.2.
1.14.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.14.4.1.3.
1.14.4.3. Pro: Justice Joseph [Story wrote](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendIIs10.html), "The militia is the natural defence of a free country against sudden foreign invasions..."
1.14.4.4. Pro: Justice Joseph [Story wrote](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendIIs10.html), "the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms... offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers..."
1.14.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.1.1.
1.14.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.9.
1.14.4.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.3.
1.14.5. Con: If a successful fight against a tyrannical government hinges on the right to bear arms, then the tyrannical government could easily crush the resistance by taking that right away.
1.14.5.1. Con: The act of the government attempting to remove said firearms being indicitive of that government becoming tyrannical, the resistance will already be armed.
1.14.5.2. Con: Which is exactly why gun owners so ardently defend their right to bear arms. The main claim here is that the 2nd Amendment should be repealed. If the government tries that, wouldn't that be a rather clear signal that it is bent on tyranny?
1.14.6. Pro: There are several examples in history in which armed civilians fought for freedom against their own tyrannical government.
1.14.6.1. Pro: In 1989 the citizens of [Romania](http://books.google.com/books?id=vBssmkvaSoQC&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=romanian+revolution+%22armed+civilians%22&source=bl&ots=Y1Nu7rpjL_&sig=psxp1I6zNz27h2ue0ce3IyYjjBU&hl=ko&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=romanian%20revolution%20%22armed%20civilians%22&f=false) violently overthrew longtime Communist Party General Secretary Nicolae Ceaușescu.  The National Salvation Front then took power and installed a series of economic and [democratic reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Revolution).
1.14.6.1.1. Con: Some were violent, but the Romanian revolution, as most revolutions when Communist regimes fell, was mostly non-violent, just people showing up on the street protesting the current regime.
1.14.6.1.2. Con: Even if the Romanian uprising could have been called violent, which it was only at the fringes, this doesn't mean that they were well armed.
1.14.6.1.2.1. Pro: The article itself refers to only [600](https://books.google.com/books?id=vBssmkvaSoQC&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=romanian+revolution+%22armed+civilians%22&source=bl&ots=Y1Nu7rpjL_&sig=psxp1I6zNz27h2ue0ce3IyYjjBU&hl=ko&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=romanian%20revolution%20%22armed%20civilians%22&f=false) weapons being distributed in a confrontation of [hundreds of thousands of unarmed people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Revolution) vs the government.
1.14.6.2. Pro: In 1990 the Tutsi citizens of [Rwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Civil_War) \(many in exile\) violently overthrew Hutu president Habyarimana.
1.14.6.2.1. Con: The Ruanda civil war was mostly fought with very primitive home-made weapons, clubs with nails, machetes etc, as private gun ownership in Ruanda is very [low](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/rwanda).
1.14.6.3. Con: There are many examples of established governments squashing said armed rebellions. An armed citizenry is heavily outmatched by a highly trained military. Successful rebellions had the support of the people so they could outnumber the military, not because they were stronger militarily. Before the American Revolution, the federalist papers were written. This suggests the power of communication is more important than that of a weapon. That's why the freedom of speech is the first amendment.
1.14.7. Con: Many countries around the world do not have a fundamental right to bear arms and they function as free societies. The right to bear arms does not guarantee the continuance of a free society or the absence of tyranny. Slavery, Watergate, internment camps, tenement bosses, et al have existed within the framework of a constitution that included the right to bear arms. With the exception of slavery, these tyrannies have been righted without the use of firearms.
1.14.8. Pro: The right to bear arms enables citizens to resist tyranny.
1.14.8.1. Con: Democracies have various constitutional and procedural safeguards against tyranny.
1.14.8.1.1. Pro: The checks and balances of the American political system ensure that no branch of government can become overtly powerful or even tyrannical.
1.14.8.1.1.1. Con: Those checks and balances over time have become frayed and blurred- changed where the original responsibilities and authorities overlap and conflict.
1.14.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: Executive orders now allow a president to create laws outside the legislative process.
1.14.8.1.1.1.2. Pro: More often Judges are now giving verdicts not on court cases, but on executive policy that may not have a current trial.
1.14.8.1.1.1.3. Pro: The Internal Revenue Service \(IRS\) has targeted nonprofit groups for scrutiny based strictly [on their political leaning](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-conservative/justice-department-settles-with-conservative-groups-over-irs-scrutiny-idUSKBN1CV1TY).
1.14.8.1.1.1.4. Pro: The Environmental Protection Agency \(a division of the executive branch\) regularly creates and enforces laws outside the legislative process and judges the violators outside the judiciary.
1.14.8.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: In [Sackett v. EPA](https://www.perc.org/2012/01/09/sackett-v-epa/) plaintiffs argued, "that by issuing compliance orders without first giving property owners a chance to contest them in court, the EPA skirts the federal law and the Fifth Amendment guarantee of due process." The Supreme Court agreed and ordered the EPA to stop judging violators outside the judiciary.
1.14.8.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.14.2.5.2.
1.14.8.1.1.3. Con: [Sandefur explains](http://volokh.com/2014/01/19/ninth-circuit-hear-challenge-obamacares-platonic-guardians-january-28/) how tyranny has successfully bypassed the checks and balances in America. Congress has created administrative agencies that betray the principles of limited, divided government. These agencies have become an "unaccountable, and unrestrained, ruler who presumes against individual liberty and requires the citizen to get permission from the state before he may act."
1.14.8.1.1.4. Con: The American political system has failed to restrain the growth of tyrannical bureaucracies.  [Arendt stated](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/10/14/hannah-arendt-on-bureaucracy-and-violence/), "bureaucracy is the form of government in which everybody is deprived of political freedom, of the power to act; for the rule by Nobody is not no-rule, and where all are equally powerless we have a tyranny without a tyrant."
1.14.8.1.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.14.8.1.1.1.3.
1.14.8.1.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.14.8.1.1.1.4.
1.14.8.1.2. Pro: Political parties have a gate-keeping function through which individuals entering the political process are scrutinized, socialized and - if necessary - stopped.
1.14.8.1.2.1. Con: The 2016 election proved that the gate-keeping functions of political parties cannot always stop the [most unsavory](https://news.gallup.com/poll/197231/trump-clinton-finish-historically-poor-images.aspx) candidates from obtaining the highest office. Trump's 61% unfavorable score is worst in presidential polling history while
Clinton's 52% unfavorable score is second-worst.
1.14.8.1.3. Con: Constitutional and procedural safeguards only counter the possibility of a domestic tyrant taking power peacefully.  These safeguards do nothing to prevent violent coups or external invasion.
1.14.8.2. Con: Americans, even though they were well-armed, have failed repeatedly in the past to defend freedom when the door to tyranny was opened by their government.
1.14.8.2.1. Pro: More than 100.000 Japanese Americans were [incarcerated in camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans) during World War 2. Armed Americans did not stand up against this government overreach and violation of rights.
1.14.8.2.1.1. Pro: The incarceration has been described as a [violation of numerous rights](http://online.sfsu.edu/jaintern/rightsviolated.html) of those affected, among them those protected by various parts of the Constitution and several Amendments.
1.14.8.2.1.2. Pro: Through the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 the US government [admitted that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans) the internment was driven by "race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership" and not by military necessity.
1.14.8.2.1.3. Con: Though not resorting to violence, many Americans did [stand up](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2015/11/09/protests_against_internment_camps_during_world_war_ii.html) against government internment of Japanese Americans.
1.14.8.2.2. Pro: In fact, the right to bear arms [enabled Americans](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1465114) to protect the white tyranny over black people during the slavery era. The Amendment's history is intrinsically linked to the preservation of tyranny.
1.14.8.3. Con: The right to bear arms is not a necessary condition to safeguard democracy and freedom. There are plenty of countries in which both were defended or even established by private citizens without arms.
1.14.8.3.1. Pro: The Second Amendment states a well regulated militia is necessary for the security of a free state. The amendment does not claim that the right to bear arms is necessary to safeguard democracy or necessary for any other purpose. The amendment merely states the right shall not be infringed.
1.14.8.3.2. Pro: In the DC v. Heller [decision](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller#Decision), the Supreme Court ruled, the "individual right to possess a firearm" is "unconnected with service in a militia". Since it's the militia which is necessary to safeguard a free state, the right to arms is not directly connected to that purpose.
1.14.8.3.3. Pro: No European country, nor Canada, have a provision like the 2nd Amendment.
1.14.8.3.4. Pro: In response to the perceived undermining of democracy, hundreds of thousands of South Koreans [took to the streets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016–17_South_Korean_protests) in 2016 until President Park was impeached. She was later [prosecuted](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/world/asia/park-geun-hye-south-korea.html) for the abuse of power, bribery and various other charges.
1.14.8.3.5. Pro: The [Orange Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution) in Ukraine was a series of peaceful protests in response to the perception that democracy was undermined through rigged elections and corruption. The result was a re-vote that brought down the sitting government.
1.14.8.4. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.10.
1.14.8.5. Con: Civilians are able to resist tyranny without arms so it cannot be the right to bear arms which enables resistance.
1.14.9. Pro: The right to bear arms helps to repel foreign invasion.
1.14.10. Pro: The right to bear arms helps to repel insurrections.
1.14.11. Pro: There are several examples in history in which armed civilians fought for freedom against foreign tyrannical governments.
1.14.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.14.4.1.2.
1.14.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.14.4.1.1.
1.14.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.2.
1.14.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.8.
1.14.11.5. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.9.
1.14.11.6. Pro: Article I, Sec. 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to issue "Letters of Marque and Reprisal" which grant civilians permission to cross over into another country's territory, capture a ship and bring it to an American port. During the War of 1812, [Madison used](https://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2014/04/09/letters-of-marque-and-reprisal-an-introduction/) such letters to oppose the British.
1.14.12. Con: With an armed populace, armed conflict between factions seems like a far more likely result of a threat from the state against its citizens. Strong democratic institutions constitute a far better guarantee against state-sanctioned harassment than the right of every citizen to bear arms.
1.14.13. Pro: -> See 1.14.1.5.1.
1.14.14. Pro: The military defends against attacks. Without a military, a tyrannical invader might \(not "will"\) overrun a free society. The military comes from the militia \(by definition\). In the USA, the militia comes from civilians \(by law\). In order for civilians to be prepared for military service, civilians should be \(not "must be"\) proficient with some military-style \(not "military grade"\) weapons. In this way, the right to bear arms is fundamental to a free society and a deterrent to tyranny.
1.14.15. Pro: There are several examples in history in which armed civilians fought for freedom against their own tyrannical government.
1.15. Con: The second amendment should be amended to take into account changing priorities, but not repealed.
1.15.1. Pro: Legislation should be relevant to the people and the times for it to be effective. Policies, standards and procedures get regularly reviewed to ensure desired results are achievable. An update of the 2nd amendment without changing the underlying intent would make it more relevant for today’s society.
1.16. Con: Repealing the 2nd Amendment would not change much at all in the United States. Over 40 states have an [unambiguous equivalent](http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/beararms/statecon.htm) to the 2nd Amendment which protects "individual" right to bear arms. If you wanted to repeal this right, you'd have to also repeal 2nd Amendment equivalent in the state constitutions as well.
1.17. Con: Responsible citizens should not lose protection of their rights due to the actions of criminals.
1.17.1. Con: Advocating for a right that is attributed to the [death or injury of thousands of children](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/gun-violence-children-america-us-study-deaths-injuries-statistics-a7797621.html) every year is not responsible.
1.17.1.1. Con: The right referred to is the right of self defense.

No murders can be attributed to self defense.
1.17.1.2. Con: Vehicles and pools have been attributed to many deaths and injury as well, but they are not regulated in the same way.
1.17.2. Con: A law cannot create or revoke rights. Repealing the Second Amendment would not make gun ownership illegal.
1.17.2.1. Con: The 13th Amendment revoked the right to own slaves. The 15th Amendment revoked the right to discriminate by race. The 18th Amendment revoked the right to own alcohol. Several rights have been revoked by law.
1.17.3. Con: What is the point of law, but to create order. All manner of law is written to protect freedoms or prevent crime. Therefore, if arms are used in the commission of crime, law will follow to protect citizens. The basic freedoms that all citizens are endowed with are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness \(aka property\). If guns pose a threat to life, then laws can be passed to protect your right to life.
1.17.4. Con: It is not necessarily penalizing to be barred from purchuasing things. In some cases, it is protection. For instance, you are not allowed to buy crystal meth.
1.17.4.1. Con: Penalized \(definition: subject to some form of punishment\) is the more accurate word.  The United states doesn't bar people from purchasing meth, it punishes them after the fact, regardless if any actual crime \(malum in se\) was committed.

It would offer far more protection for users if they were permitted to legally purchase methamphetamine.  There would be no violent black market, quality would be much higher,  professionals could monitor use, and treatment wouldn't carry as large of a stigma.
1.17.4.2. Con: If drugs were not criminalized, there would be far less crime in the country, including gun crime. Many robberies, burglaries, assaults, and homicides [are drug and/or gang related](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/246404.pdf).
