Discussion Title: Should Genetically Modified Organisms (or GMOs) be promoted as part of a sustainable agricultural economy?

1. Genetically Modified Organisms should be promoted as part of a sustainable agricultural economy.
1.1. Pro: The main reason that people fear GMOs is a lack of understanding as to what the term GMO means.
1.1.1. Pro: The term 'GMO' itself is misleading because it groups genetic modifications by breeding in the same group as 'GE' \(genetically engineered\) or transgenic organisms, which are two different types of man-made genetic changes that should be addressed in isolation from the others. GMOs can be created through pollination or other methods. GEs are made in a lab. Transgenic organisms are made in a lab, and combine DNA from unrelated organisms.
1.2. Pro: [GMO crops](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/gmos-and-pesticides/) can be engineered to produce biochemical pesticides. These "are pesticides that the plants themselves produce after genetic material has been added to them" and are non-toxic upon consumption. The new pest resistant crops need less or no synthetic pesticides and are therefore more efficient.
1.2.1. Con: Studies are [inconclusive](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/09/01/492091546/how-gmos-cut-the-use-of-pesticides-and-perhaps-boosted-them-again) as to whether GMO crops require more or fewer pesticides.
1.2.1.1. Con: To be clear as to the parent claim - studies are extremely conclusive as to GE crops substantially reducing usage of insecticides. Herbcides are less clear.
1.2.1.2. Con: Adoption of glyphosate has supported a [move away from more toxic and persistent herbicides](http://www.crediblehulk.org/index.php/2015/06/02/about-those-more-caustic-herbicides-that-glyphosate-helped-replace-by-credible-hulk/).
1.2.1.3. Con: Trends in the use of herbicides are not clear cut and evidence suggests that glyphosate adoption has not only helped to reduce overall toxicity, but also that [rates of herbicide usage increase is equal or lower in GMO systems.](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14865)
1.3. Pro: People should be allowed the freedom to choose their own food.
1.3.1. Pro: For some individuals, natural foods may be the best option. For others, GMO foods may be the best option. There is no one-size-fits-all. Limiting access to GMOs helps nobody.
1.3.1.1. Con: There is no evidence that GMOs are healthier than natural food.
1.3.2. Con: Without labels indicating whether a food is GM or not, consumers don't have enough information to choose what kind of food they eat.
1.3.2.1. Con: There are a range of non mandatory market provided labels for those seeking out non GMO foods. These satisfy market demands in much the same way that other faith based labels like Kosher or Halal do.
1.3.2.2. Con: A GMO label itself is arbitrary and provides little meaning. The range of breding methods that should be subject to a label is not based on any objective test of risk nor degree of genetic change. For example, mutagenesis alters thousands of genes randomly but is not the focus of labelling; herbicides are applied to non GMO crops; and large companies also sell non GMO seeds. The label is not informative of much.
1.4. Con: So far GMO has mainly been used to make pesticide resistant crops to enable more [aggressive pesticide](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethhoffman/2013/07/02/gmo-crops-mean-more-herbicide-not-less/#65cca7943cd5) use. This is not good for people or the environment.
1.4.1. Con: Assessments of herbicide usage have to look at weighting that accounts for toxicity and environmental fate. Glyphosate uptake has corresponded with [reduction](http://www.crediblehulk.org/index.php/2015/06/02/about-those-more-caustic-herbicides-that-glyphosate-helped-replace-by-credible-hulk/) in more [caustic](http://weedcontrolfreaks.com/2016/05/as-consumers-shift-to-non-gmo-sugar-farmers-may-be-forced-to-abandon-environmental-and-social-gains/) herbicides and herbicide usage trends have been the [same or greater](http://weedcontrolfreaks.com/2017/04/gmos-and-herbicides-its-complicated/) in non GMO crops. The application rates are hardly “aggressive” either.
1.4.2. Con: Rolling herbicide and insecticide usage into one aggregate analysis is a flawed way of looking at GMO impacts. The Bt trait has meant up to a 90% [reduction](http://cottonaustralia.com.au/cotton-library/fact-sheets/cotton-fact-file-biotechnology) in insecticides. In some cases pesticide industry has had to [scale](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-06/monsanto-killing-dupont-insecticide-sales-with-intacta-soybeans) back production because of Bt.
1.4.3. Con: Looking at current usage alone is a poor predictor of future food applications. This is like looking at early computers and claiming all such technology will always be large, expensive and only for few applications. New GE methods are significantly reducing costs and expanding possible applications.
1.5. Con: GMO may reduce biodiversity by outcompeting similar plants leading to unforeseen consequenses for the environment, animals and people
1.5.1. Con: The same as with any other type of breeding. The best examples are chickens. There are a very limited number of races of chickens out there in producing meat and eggs.
1.5.2. Con: Bringing things into perspective. Everything has unforseen consequences for the environment. These consequences can be positve and negative. The problem is, we as humans are often biased to see the negative and overlook the positve.
1.6. Pro: GMOs offer nutritious and easy to grow plants that can be more resistant to disease and climatic events. They can provide a solution to the lack of food in certain parts of the world
1.6.1. Pro: A major UN FAO report \([IAASTD, 5.5.4](https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/8590)\) concluded that: '\[A more GMO\] pathway could see traits for the remediation of polluted or degraded land or adaptation to heat and drought, which could assist in dealing with current agroenvironmental challenges and in the adaptation to rapid climate change.'
1.6.2. Pro: GMO crops can be [nutritionally fortified](https://futurism.com/new-genetically-modified-rice-could-feed-billions/) in order to reduce the incidence of malnutrition and attendant developmental disorders, saving and improving millions of lives.
1.6.3. Pro: [800 million](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/feeding-the-world/) people in the world are undernourished, despite the fact that the current output of the world’s farms could supply over 11 billion people with 2,000 calories per day. Increasing food supply in impoverished regions would be an efficient way to reduce this gross inequality.
1.6.4. Pro: A major UN FAO report \([IAASTD,  ch 5.5.4](https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/8590)\) examined future scenarios with greater or lesser access to GMO and concluded '...the elimination of ... transgenesis would slow but not stop the pace of agricultural research and improvement. As a result, humanity would likely be more vulnerable to climatic and other shocks and to increased natural resource scarcity under this alternative pathway.'
1.6.4.1. Pro: The climate is changing quickly. Although plants and animals evolve to compensate, the plants we need may not evolve fast enough to support the world's population \(nutrition and/or quantity\). GMOs will be part of the solution.
1.6.5. Pro: In many developing countries, the climate is very hot and dry, meaning that crops are difficult to grow and food has a short shelf-life. GM crops could solve both these issues.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Over a five-year period, a total of [2.9 million farmers](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/02/drought-resistant-crops-gm-africa-monsanto-syngenta-dupont) in 13 African countries saw their yields increase by 20% to 30% after sowing drought-tolerant GMO seeds.
1.6.6. Con: If GMOs trigger adverse effects for people's health, it is false that they could provide a long-term solution to food shortages; that would be like saying the production of poison could alleviate world hunger.
1.6.6.1. Con: GMOs do not create adverse effects for people's health anymore than normal organisms do.
1.6.6.2. Pro: There is a human health risk attached to the use of GMOs.
1.6.6.2.1. Con: There is a human health risk attached to drinking [water](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/water-intoxication#1). But there's still a clear benefit to drinking it. The same applies to GMOs.
1.6.6.2.2. Pro: There is a risk of unknown unknowns with rapid change and no long term studies.
1.6.6.2.3. Pro: There are multiple studies that suggest adverse human and animal [reactions](http://responsibletechnology.org/gmo-education/section1/) to GMO foods.
1.6.6.2.3.1. Con: This doesn't mean that the GMO process is flawed.
1.6.6.2.3.2. Con: Many of these studies are [not supported](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) by mainstream science.
1.6.6.2.3.2.1. Pro: Some studies and whistleblowers suggest that financial/political influence is being used to falsely discredit or marginalize those people and studies which do not affirm the safety of GMO foods.

[GMO spokesman turned GMO whistleblower followed the science](http://gmwatch.org/en/news/archive/2013/15096-interview-with-dr-thierry-vrain-gmo-whistleblower)

[The bias of industry-sponsored or industry-linked studies on the safety of hazardous products is well documented.](http://earthopensource.org/gmomythsandtruths/sample-page/3-health-hazards-gm-foods/3-5-myth-claim-gm-foods-unsafe-selective-data-since-many-studies-show-safety/)

[An Illusory Consensus behind GMO Health Assessment](http://www.scienceforthepublic.org/assets/154/STHV%20GMO%20ILLUSORY%20CONSENSUS.pdf)
1.6.6.2.3.2.1.1. Con: The claim of [Theirry Vrain](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/glp-facts/thierry-vrain-molecular-biologist-claims-gmos-poison-food-supply/) being a whistleblower is not supported by his past position, which was not significant in terms of positions held and specialisation in the area. His claims including emphasis on flawed studies are not well supported by evidence. Regardless, the consistent views on safety across hundreds of independent science bodies and large literature reviews is not undermined by individual personalities or voices, as is the case with fields such as AGW or vaccines.
1.6.6.2.3.2.1.2. Con: The critique of an 'illusory consensus' on GMO safety is valid to the extent that if some GMO proponents argue that there are no innate risks and no need for regulatory screening, this position is not supported by the literature. However, the more common position \(by bodies including the [WHO](http://www.who.int/foodsafety/areas_work/food-technology/faq-genetically-modified-food/en/)\) is that while genetic engineering has risks and should be regulated. The consensus view applies to the specifically approved and regulated crops, not the theoretical risks.
1.6.6.2.3.2.1.3. Con: A primary source cited for claims of adverse impacts outside of industry studies is [Domingo \(2011\)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.664.8314&rep=rep1&type=pdf). This review summaries studies showing no concern, and those showing 'serious concerns'. However, some of these studies are recognised for methodological problems such as [Seralini et. al. \(2007\)](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2986), [Malatesta et al. \(2008\)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691511006399). Issues include not controlling with isogenic lines, inadequate sample sizes, and 'p hacking'. [Other systematic reviews reach different conclusions.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691511006399)
1.6.6.2.3.2.1.4. Con: While there have been cases of industry 'strong-arming' and pushing campaigns against some study/authors, the particular studies that have received high profile critique have been very broadly recognised outside of industry as having serious methodological or design flaws \(e.g. Seralini \[[1](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2910/abstract), [2](http://www.science20.com/news_articles/700_researchers_call_gilleseric_seralini_release_gmo_test_data-95574), [3](http://parrottlab.uga.edu/parrottlab/Publications/Arjo-et-al-TRAG-2013.pdf), [4](http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/349/feeding-study-in-rats-with-genetically-modified-nk603-maize-and-with-a-glyphosate-containing-formulation-roundup-published-bei-seralini-et-al-2012.pdf)\]\). Industry influence is not the major driver of those studies being discredited and individually is it not accurate to cast critiques as falsely discrediting the works.
1.6.6.2.3.2.1.5. Con: Reviews of industry bias in publication \(of comparatively small samples compared to the overall body of research\) need to be put against the larger context of publications, where a [significant proportion are non-industry aligned](https://www.biofortified.org/2014/02/industry-funded-gmo-studies/), and results across industry and non-industry studies generally align. Large systematic reviews and meta-analyses in recent years confirm safety from a weight-of-evidence perspective, including a [decade of EU-funded research](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/07388551.2013.823595), and [an overview of 10 years of studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24041244).
1.6.6.2.3.2.1.6. Con: The [review paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.642.8444&rep=rep1&type=pdf) \(as cited in parent claim\) demonstrated bias associated with industry affiliation but not funding. The results are aggregated in a way that does not demonstrate that 'negative' outcomes = health risks; but can include simply failure to show a desired benefit in a test product. It does not show a clear split in results in terms of safety.
1.6.6.2.3.2.1.7. Con: Industry bias does occur in publications but assessment of this must recognise that that as GMO studies are for the commercialisation of crops, there are built in internal reviews within corporations that mean only successful products are likely to make it to latter stage assessment and publication; and many of the studies are compositional studies for substantial equivalence of crops which are generally favourable. [The bias largely represents commercial reality, not underhand tactics.](https://www.biofortified.org/2014/02/industry-funded-gmo-studies/)
1.6.6.2.3.3. Con: The studies suggesting this are typically underpowered, poorly designed, and of [limited to no statistical validity](http://weedcontrolfreaks.com/2014/07/seralini-rat-study-revisited/). The most influential studies include works that have been [retracted](http://retractionwatch.com/2014/06/24/retracted-seralini-gmo-rat-study-republished/)  or published in predatory journals including [without peer review](http://retractionwatch.com/2014/06/26/republished-seralini-gmo-rat-study-was-not-peer-reviewed-says-editor/). [Well designed and conducted studies](http://www.grace-fp7.eu/en/content/grace-published-its-1-year-feeding-trial-gm-maize-mon810-variety) show no such effects on animals.
1.6.6.2.3.4. Con: The popular proponents of claims of GMO harms include people with [no expertise or training](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/glp-facts/jeffrey-m-smith/) in the topic, or [those with a profit incentive](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2017/05/05/follow-money-organic-industry-funds-anti-gmo-campaigns/) to dispute GMO safety.
1.6.6.2.3.5. Con: The position of [multiple](http://www.siquierotransgenicos.cl/2015/06/13/more-than-240-organizations-and-scientific-institutions-support-the-safety-of-gm-crops/) [credible](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/once-again-us-expert-panel-says-genetically-engineered-crops-are-safe-eat) [authorities](https://www.oecd.org/science/biotrack/46815888.pdf) disagrees with this position, after putting research into the broader context of the literature
1.6.6.2.4. Con: GMOs are tightly regulated by several government bodies such as the [EFSA](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/genetically-modified-organisms), meaning that GMOs undergo extensive safety testing prior to commercialisation.
1.6.6.2.4.1. Pro: Every GMO is unique, just as every species, so they go through the same process as normally occurring organisms.
1.6.6.2.5. Con: A potential health concern is in herbicide usage associated with GMO traits, such as glyphosate. Heath risks of pesticides generally are a real issue, so it is reasonable to ask whether the herbicides that have increased with GMO adoption are creating new health risks our diet.
1.6.6.2.5.1. Con: The [rates of herbicide](https://ppipblog.com/2016/09/06/do-farmers-really-drench-douse-or-slather-their-crops-with-pesticides/) \(and all pesticide\) application, in developed economies is highly regulated, with limits set so that residues do not present a dietary risk. Because of these laws, and the cost of pesticides, there are low risks of pesticide residues associated with GMO crops being at a level which would pose dietary risks.
1.6.6.2.5.2. Con: Systematic reviews show a reduction in toxic pesticide usage [through GMO adoption](http://fafdl.org/wiki/index.php?title=GMOs_and_Pesticide_Use:_Systematic_Reviews), specifically a\) reduction in insecticide usage and b\) reduction in the toxicity of herbicides used.
1.6.6.2.5.3. Con: There are [comprehensive regulatory frameworks](http://fafdl.org/blog/2017/04/13/glyphosate-vs-caffeine-acute-and-chronic-toxicity-assessments-explained/) that ensure trace levels of herbicides are not harmful to human health, given low dosage and conservative risk modelling.
1.6.6.2.5.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.6.6.2.6. Con: Genetic modifications have been in existence for millennia, and almost all food we eat today is far from its wild counterpart. It is thus illogical to fear transgenic GMOs.
1.6.6.2.6.1. Pro: Even picking foods from the wild might be genetically modified, due to hybridizing with already GMO'd crops. This makes it near impossible to avoid GMOs in foods.
1.6.6.2.6.2. Con: 'Natural' genetic evolution happens due to survival of the fittest, or via selective breeding whereby farmers will take seeds from the best crops and reproduce the crop using those. Unlike GMO production, this does not involve adding unnatural chemicals to the crop.
1.6.6.2.6.2.1. Con: The GM process is less important than the plant that results from it. In this sense natural selection does the same thing as transgenic manipulation, but in slower, less precise and random fashion.
1.6.6.2.6.2.1.1. Con: Natural selection involves the genesis of new genes at random; it doesn't do the same thing as transgenics. Transgenics is the intelligent design of organisms through the addition of genes from other organisms.
1.6.6.2.6.2.1.2. Pro: Just as with normal plants, GM foods should be evaluated on a case by case basis. There is no reason why a GM organism couldn't have evolved naturally in the wild.
1.6.6.2.6.2.2. Con: A primary method used to produce the crops we eat today \(which is not labelled as a GMO and is available in organic production\) is [mutagenisis](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/28/science/28crop.html). Unlike genetic engineering, this works through application of radiation or chemicals to seeds to promote random mutations.
1.6.6.2.6.3. Pro: All foods today are GMO, though the term is often used for only the modern methods. The traditional methods are too random and have greater risks and costs. The term "[organic](https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm214871.htm)" is just a scam that people must learn more about, as the pesticides classified as such are often far more dangerous, and no foods fit the context in which the term is often used.
1.6.6.2.6.4. Pro: New technologies such as [CRISPR](https://www.acsh.org/news/2018/04/03/crispr-created-foods-are-different-gmos-its-wrong-anti-gmo-activists-pretend-theyre-not-12790) merely enhance the mechanism of mutagenesis, not the end result.
1.6.6.2.7. Con: Any assessment of risk has to consider the actual risk - post regulation and scrutiny - not just the theoretical risk. Genetic engineering methods can create novel risks but these are highly scrutinised. The scientific consensus is that the post regulated risks of GMOs are equal to or lower than their conventional counterparts. Rather, some unregulated methods [generate greater risks but these are not assessed.](http://www.crediblehulk.org/index.php/2017/10/24/genetically-engineering-foods-involves-greater-precision-and-lower-risk-of-unintentional-changes-than-traditional-breeding-methods/)
1.6.7. Pro: GM crops can be made resistant to microbial infections, such as the potato blight that led to the [Irish Potato Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_\(Ireland\)) in the 19th century.
1.7. Con: The only two transgenic crops engineered for herbicide \(namely glyphosate\) resistance and used on a large scale are corn and soybeans. While other modified traits may not be as harmful, the current usage of this sort of GMO crop creates and promotes an increased use of herbicides that is [not sustainable](https://www.nap.edu/read/23395/chapter/2).
1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.7.2. Con: Herbicides are applied to GE and non GE crops alike.
1.7.3. Con: In specific case studies of Roundup-ready crops such as sugar beets, the herbicides used for the non-GMO options [are far inferior](http://weedcontrolfreaks.com/2016/05/as-consumers-shift-to-non-gmo-sugar-farmers-may-be-forced-to-abandon-environmental-and-social-gains/) for health, environment and cost.
1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.8. Pro: GMOs can be used to create non-food items, like biofuels, cloth and plastics that are 100% renewable and carbon neutral. This can be done with much less space, thus reducing the need to take away from food production.
1.8.1. Con: [Biofuels](http://energy-reality.org/biofuels/) are unsustainable and destroy lands for production.
1.8.1.1. Con: Even if that were correct, their lower carbon footprint is an important tool for oil dependant societies to begin to reduce their overall carbon output in the short term without adversely affecting their populations or economy until more ecologically sound technologies can become more established.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: The [same amount](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513003856) of energy is needed as input to produce the equivalent output in biofuels.
1.8.2. Pro: GMOs significantly decrease the amount of greenhouse gases emitted due to agricultural practices. In 2012, this was equivalent to removing [27 billion kg](http://www.pgeconomics.co.uk/page/36/-gm-crop-use-continues-to-benefit-the-environment-and-farmers) of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
1.9. Con: GMOs mean that farmers are not economically independent due to patents, and subsequently must rely on seed companies who control their livelihood completely.
1.9.1. Con: The same could be said about tractors and harvesters.
1.9.1.1. Con: Farmers are dependent on technology. Most farmers can not produce technologies. The reason is they are a farm and they produce plants and animals. In a broad sense we are all dependent on something. The question is if it makes sense for the individual case.
1.9.2. Pro: The seed company Monsanto [won](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/12/monsanto-sues-farmers-seed-patents) $23 million by suing 410 farmers and 56 small businesses who saved their GM seeds, highlighting the vulnerability of farmers to the major seed distributors.
1.9.2.1. Con: The practice of suing is very marginal in the context of the overall market. Suing is done to enforce contract law and proceeds go to charity. Over decades of operation, selling seeds to over 300,000 farmers per year, [Monsanto have sued less than 150 farmers.](https://monsanto.com/company/media/statements/lawsuits-against-farmers/)
1.9.2.2. Con: [Many farmers do not wish to save seeds](http://www.thefarmersdaughterusa.com/2016/02/no-farmers-dont-want-save-seeds.html) and would prefer the stability of a new seed each year, saving on management and cleaning costs, and benefitting from high performance hybrids.
1.9.2.3. Con: [Contracts are associated with a particular annual seed purchase](http://thefarmerslife.com/whats-in-a-monsanto-contract/), and do not mandate the other inputs to be used with the crop. Given existing dynamics not to save seeds \(eg for efficiency reasons or becuase of the advantages of buying hybrid crops annually\) the IP restrictions do no represent ongoing lock ins or traps for farmers. They could return to alternative crops or saved seeds if desired. However the high uptake of GE crops where available suggests this is not desired by many farmers.
1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.9.2.2.
1.9.4. Con: -> See 1.9.2.3.
1.9.5. Con: This is true for many non-GMO seeds.
1.9.6. Con: Buying seeds is economically convenient for many kinds of cultivations, and producing seeds autonomously is not a widely spread practice in modern farming.
1.9.7. Con: Many farmers, particularly in developing countries, rely on GMOs to make a living where they would not have had a chance before. GMOs are thus the best option for many farmers.
1.9.8. Con: Patents predate genetic engineering by many decades and are [not unique](http://www.crediblehulk.org/index.php/2015/07/08/genetically-engineered-crops-and-seed-saving-myths/) to genetically engineered products.
1.10. Con: -> See 1.6.6.2.
1.11. Con: Lack of genetic diversity due to monoculture of GMOs increases the vulnerability of the human populations that depend on them.
1.11.1. Con: [GMOs do not foster or drive underlying trends in broadacre commodity crop production](http://appliedmythology.blogspot.com/2014/08/do-gmo-crops-foster-monoculture.html?m=1) \('monoculture'\), which is often blamed for reduced genetic diversity. And adding genetically engineered traits to a hybrid seed stock doesn't further reduce diversity, in any case.
1.11.2. Con: The picture of seed diversity isn't really as dire [as is commonly thought](http://gmopundit.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/seed-biodiverity-as-measured-on-in.html?m=1). This myth of loss of diversity came from counting seed names in 1901 catalogs and then looking for the in recent catalogs. What they neglected to realize is that a lot of early seeds were sold under a variety of names. 

The number of varieties has actually [increased in last 100 years.](http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=400020126087066099117095093064125010096068026065069063076086024102113023127116100127028021100056061044043007103125107122088104049022017012058022010064125070123090064093085107027100078118123024023004118085071064121112027110017103123090092022067095017&EXT=pdf)
1.11.3. Con: The premise often is that GMOs are the driver of trends like broad acre corn and soy. Rather, GMO investment \(given high capital cost\) has followed large commodity markets in the first instance. If the concern is this kind of farming, then [mechanisation is a larger explanation than breeding methods](http://www.fancybeans.com/blog/2013/05/25/how-to-really-march-against-monsanto/).
1.11.4. Con: The breeding programs that set up crop diversity [are an ongoing set of practices against which GE has been incorporated.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20054521/)

With specific crops where GE has been dominant, the introduction of GE traits has not further reduced diversity \(e.g. [cotton](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/abstracts/43/2/515), [soybeans](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/abstracts/43/1/409)\)
1.11.5. Con: The [National Academy of Sciences review of GMOs](https://nas-sites.org/ge-crops/) concluded that: Since 1987, there has been a decrease in diversity of crops grown in the United States— particularly in the Midwest—and a decrease in frequency of rotation of crops. Studies could not be found that tested for a cause–effect relationship between GE crops and this pattern. Changes in commodity prices might also be responsible for this pattern.
1.11.6. Con: The [National Academy of Sciences review of GMOs](https://nas-sites.org/ge-crops/) concluded that: Although the number of available crop varieties declined in the 20th century, there is evidence that genetic diversity among major crop varieties has not declined in the late 20th and early 21st centuries since the introduction and widespread adoption of GE crops in some countries.
1.12. Con: There is an animal health risk attached to the use of GMOs.
1.12.1. Con: This is not a major issue for those who do not equate the value of animal life and the value of human life. For these people, if humans are not negatively affected, there is not a substantial enough reason to ban GMOs.
1.12.1.1. Con: Animal consumption of GMOs can lead to human consumption of GMOs through meat consumption.
1.12.1.2. Con: Even if we do not equate human and animal life, harm to animals should still be a factor. For example, we shouldn't just go shooting endangered rhinos and defacing priceless artifacts for fun because they aren't worth a human life.
1.12.2. Con: While there are potential risks from some genetic engineering techniques, the consensus of authorities is that [post regulation](http://www.who.int/foodsafety/areas_work/food-technology/faq-genetically-modified-food/en/), risks are [equal or lower](http://www.crediblehulk.org/index.php/2015/11/22/the-international-scientific-consensus-on-genetically-engineered-food-safety/) than non GMO food and no adverse impacts demonstrated.
