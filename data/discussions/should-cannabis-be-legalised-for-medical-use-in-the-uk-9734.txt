Discussion Title: Should cannabis be legalised for medical use in the UK?

1. Cannabis should be legalised for medical use in the UK.
1.1. Pro: Humans have an [endo-cannabinoid system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system). Basically we are designed to receive cannabinoids as cures.
1.2. Pro: Overwhelming scientific research supports the beneficial medical effects of using cannabis.
1.2.1. Pro: There is peer reviewed Vitro [evidence](https://www.sgul.ac.uk/research/research-news/cannabis-extract-can-have-dramatic-effect-on-brain-cancer-says-new-research) that THC can kill cancer cells. Vivo studies would help understand how to make this universal.
1.2.2. Con: Any medicinal benefits of cannabis should be researched and drugs developed based on specific active ingredients, instead of it being legalised as an unrefined substance.
1.2.2.1. Con: Without legalisation it cannot be thoroughly researched.
1.2.2.2. Con: Even if future research leads to safer and more effective treatments, this should not stop people taking advantage of treatments known from research to be sufficiently safe and effective today.
1.2.3. Pro: Cannabis is especially and [scientifically proven](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1097-0142\(19820815\)50:4%3C636::AID-CNCR2820500404%3E3.0.CO;2-4) to help to mitigate the worst signs of chemotherapy. That is the reason it is available on prescription in many countries, including the USA and Netherlands.
1.2.4. Pro: Cannabidiol is claimed to help with [sleep disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28349316).
1.2.4.1. Con: Though it may decrease sleep problems in the short-term, it could [impair sleep quality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28349316) long-run.
1.2.5. Pro: [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614667) suggests that cannabidiol can help with tremors caused by drugs used to control Parkinson's disease.
1.2.6. Pro: [Research](https://radiationtherapynews.com/2014/11/18/study-finds-cannabis-extractradiotherapy-combo-can-make-brain-cancer-tumors-virtually-disappear/) by London University Hospital claims that cannabidiol, with the help of radiation therapy, can make some brain tumours virtually disappear.
1.2.7. Pro: It could help a lot of people, Including Cronic pain conditions. [Evidence](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322051.php)
1.2.8. Pro: Cannabis users are less likely to suffer from Psychosis and Schizophrenia when compared to non users as the 2008 [Keele study](http://ukcia.org/wordpress/?p=76) showed, which surveyed over 5,000 regular uses of cannabis.
1.2.8.1. Con: The study in question found no causal link between cannabis and psychiatric disorders.
1.2.9. Pro: Cannabis oil helps to reduce the number and impact of seizures in epilepsy and similar diseases.
1.2.9.1. Pro: This has been widely publicised recently in the case of 12-year-old [Billy Caldwell](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44458807) where this treatment could be the only thing keeping him alive.
1.3. Pro: Legalisation could ensure the safe and regulated procurement of the substance, mitigating the negative effects of a black market.
1.3.1. Pro: Under the current illegal system, unscrupulous sellers who act outside the law and cannot be as easily monitored are more likely to exist.
1.3.2. Pro: It will stop criminal gangs from profiting.
1.3.3. Pro: If it was legalised it would stop police wasting time chasing people that sell it.
1.3.3.1. Pro: An already under-pressure police force will have less petty cannabis-related crime to deal with allowing them to be more efficient elsewhere. Similarly there will be less pressure on the prison system, which too is currently struggling.
1.3.4. Pro: Quality control could be implemented to ensure a standardised and measurable dosage could be administered.
1.3.5. Pro: People will use it medicinally anyway and legalising it will simply allow ill people to get the medicine they need without the without the difficulties it entails.
1.3.5.1. Pro: It would reduce the risk to people who are currently seeking treatments abroad for their health care.
1.3.6. Con: The majority of the substance that is bought on the black market is for personal use. As this would not fall under medical purposes, a black market would still exist.
1.3.6.1. Con: Personal use may be recreational or medical. Those who are using it to relieve symptoms are subject to the same laws, despite its medicinal  qualities being beneficial to their health and wellbeing.
1.3.6.2. Con: No matter what share of the market is accounted for by medical users, these users should not have to be exposed to the risks of a black market, even if one continues to exist for recreational use.
1.3.7. Pro: Illegality just pushed the problem to obscurity.
1.4. Con: There is no reason to legalise whole cannabis plant when individual cannabinoids can be more accurately dosed.
1.4.1. Pro: Individual cannabinoids act with [higher selectivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15582455), exerting better therapeutic effects and fewer side effects.
1.5. Pro: Legalisation for medical use enables greater tax revenue and additional jobs through introduction of a linked industry.
1.5.1. Pro: Legalizing cannabis, removes a medicine from the hands of illegal drug gangs and puts the money back into the economy instead.
1.5.2. Con: The government could be greedy and over taxation is a possibility.
1.5.3. Pro: The tax and revenue generated by cannabis sales will not only save the NHS but reinforce it. Not only will it secure the NHS and its foundations but also provide cost effective alternative treatments. This will also open the door for other drugs to be further tested and implemented that are showing promising results but not utilised due to their categorisation as an illegal substance.
1.5.4. Con: The same concept applies to synthetic, therapeutic cannabinoids
1.6. Con: Cannabis has harmful effects on people's health.
1.6.1. Con: While cannabis can have side effects it is impossible to die from overdose unlike prescription medication.
1.6.2. Pro: Psychiatric [researchers](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jnc.14549) found out that long-term use of either cannabis or cannabis-based drugs impairs memory. They found that mice exposed to the drug long-term had "significant ... memory impairments" and could not even discriminate between a familiar and novel object.
1.6.2.1. Con: The study cited did not administer cannabis, they used WIN 55,212‐2 which is not present in cannabis. It does bind to the CB1 receptor, as does THC, but it cannot be assumed to have the same effects.
1.6.2.2. Con: It has been shown that individual cannabinoids have different effects to the combination found in cannabis so any study looking at an isolated cannabinoid tells us little about natural cannabis.
1.6.3. Con: All medications carry side effects, for example opiates which are widely used as painkillers are [highly addictive](https://www.addictioncenter.com/opiates/). The risks of medical cannabis should be balanced against the benefits for a particularly individual, just like any drug.
1.6.4. Con: Studies have shown a [positive correlation](https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343%2813%2900200-3/abstract) with lower BMI and increased metabolic rates in marijuana users. Consequently, diabetes risk lowers and waste lines are generally thinner in users compared to those who don't intake cannabis.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Marijuana has hundreds of active cannabinoids are known to function on many different cell receptors not just cannabinoid receptors, this has been linked to increased metabolic activity. In other words, cannabinoids are actively causing somatic cells to function better/optimally.
1.6.5. Pro: Cannabis can exacerbate mental health issues. This could lead to unintentional triggering of ill-health.
1.6.5.1. Pro: [Research](http://www.nationaldrugstrategy.gov.au/internet/drugstrategy/Publishing.nsf/content/C22A31B6C742DFE5CA25767E00122541/$File/m684.pdf) shows that cannabis and psychotic
disorders occur together more often than would be expected by chance.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: Correlation is not causation.
1.6.5.2. Pro: [A study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC135489/) following 1600 adolescents showed that those who used cannabis daily were five times more likely to develop depression and anxiety in later life.
1.6.5.2.1. Con: This does not imply causation, and in fact the drivers of early life drug use and later anxiety/depression can be the same.
1.6.5.3. Con: -> See 1.6.3.
1.6.5.4. Con: [Epidemiological studies](https://www.schres-journal.com/article/S0920-9964\(09\)00269-2/fulltext) have failed to find a correlation between increased cannabis use in the population and the expected rise in schizophrenia cases.
1.6.5.5. Con: The exact same can be said of alcohol, prescription medications and Even heavy social media use, in fact harmful effects on mental health are higher in all three of these totally legal things.
1.6.6. Pro: Recently, the cannabis plant was found to contain [carcinogenic mutagens](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/problemsanddisorders/cannabis.aspx) that can affect people's lungs. Thus, any introduction for medical use may have more harmful impacts in the long term.
1.6.6.1. Con: Legalisation would increase access to alternatives to smoking such as "edibles" \(no lung damage\) or juicing of the raw plant \(without heat, it has no psychoactive properties, thus no potential for purported mental health side effects\).
1.6.6.2. Con: Cancerous mutagens could be present in cannabis if grown with inorganic growth regulators.[humboldtseeds.net](https://www.humboldtseeds.net/en/blog/plant-growth-regulators-weed/)
1.6.7. Con: So do other substances, such as tobacco and alcohol, and yet these are legal.
1.7. Con: Cannabis has been proven to have very negative impacts on a person's learning abilities.
1.7.1. Con: The effect of cannabis disrupting the memory can be used to treat habitual memory illnesses [including PTSD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26092091/).
1.7.2. Pro: Marijuana causes learning and memory impairments.
1.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.
1.7.2.2. Pro: ALL 1,000 U.S. cannabis smokers in a [study](https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad160833) had "low blood flow" throughout the brain and, tragically, restricted blood flow in the brain's memory/dementia region.
1.7.2.2.1. Con: This study did not study ordinary recreational cannabis users or medical users, they were people diagnosed with Cannabis Use Disorder. To draw conclusions about moderate or medical cannabis use from a study of people with Cannabis Use Disorder is like generalising from alcoholics to moderate drinkers.
1.7.3. Pro: For example it makes it harder to concentrate as well as impact on said person's capacity to organise and use information.
1.7.4. Pro: Memory impairment from marijuana use occurs because [THC alters](http://kgov.com/negative-effects-of-marijuana-pot-research-shows-cannabis-is-harmful) how the hippocampus, a brain area responsible for memory formation, processes information.
1.8. Pro: It should be up to the individual to decide whether the risk is worth taking.
1.8.1. Pro: In a true free society, individuals must take responsibility for their actions. If they do no harm to others or others property the rest of us should have no problem with individual choice.
1.9. Con: Legalising for medical purposes will encourage wider use.
1.9.1. Con: Wider use of cannabis is safer than wider use of alcohol which can be over-dosed leading to fatalities.
1.9.2. Pro: There could be a potential risk for illegal users of the drugs to abuse the medical system in order to get to them. This would put strain on the NHS.
1.9.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.3.
1.9.3. Con: The statistics in countries that have already legalized suggest that an increase in use is not [likely](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/almost-addicted/201502/will-legalizing-marijuana-increase-its-use-probably-not).
1.9.4. Con: A decision on if a medical treatment should be made available to patients should not be based on if non-patients will use that treatment. This certainly isn't how pharmaceuticals are handled, so cannabis shouldn't be treated differently.
1.9.5. Con: If cannabis can bring benefits or joy to the people that use it, then wider use is not necessarily a bad thing.
1.9.6. Pro: Bristol University researchers' [peer-reviewed study](http://kgov.com/negative-effects-of-marijuana-pot-research-shows-cannabis-is-harmful) of 5,000 youths found that teens who regularly smoke pot are 26 times more likely to begin using other drugs by age 21, and they're 37 times more likely to be addicted to nicotine and 3 times more likely to have an alcohol problem, all as compared to teens who don't smoke marijuana.
1.9.6.1. Con: Bristol Universities study is irrelevant in this instances as it assumes that medicinal marijuana is to be smoked and that teens will be smoking it. THC can be consumed in much safer and far less 'cool' means. If we are worried about it leading teens in to other drugs, put an age limit on it.
