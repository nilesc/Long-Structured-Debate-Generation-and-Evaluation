Discussion Title: Should the sale of semi-automatic rifles be banned?

1. The sale of [semi-automatic rifles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_rifle) \(external box magazine\) should be banned.
1.1. Pro: The top 4 deadliest mass shootings committed by a single actor were carried out with semi automatic box magazine fed rifles - [Oslo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Norway_attacks), [Orlando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_nightclub_shooting), [Port Arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur_massacre_\(Australia\)), [Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_shooting).
1.1.1. Con: While that is true, it must be stated that almost all gun related homicides are committed with a pistol. [In 2014 there were 5,562 homicides committed with a handgun and 248 with a rifle.](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2010-2014.xls) At the same time, knives were used to kill 1,567 people, Blunt objects were used to kill 435 people and personal weapons \(hands, feet and such\) were used to kill 660 people. A similar trend follows every preceding year.
1.2. Con: In a high-stress self-defense situation the ability to fire multiple rounds in quick succession is vital in countering the loss of accuracy incurred under stress. If you have only a bolt action/lever/pump, you might as well have a single-shot musket for all the good one round will do you.
1.2.1. Con: Using a clip of cartridges, it's possible to reload an internal fed rifle nearly as fast as inserting an external magazine.  It all depends on how the access to the internal magazine is designed.
1.2.1.1. Pro: A [revolver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FbUMqoyjDw) can be reloaded very fast using a clip.
1.2.1.2. Pro: An [M1 Garand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiTJOz1XFGA) can be reloaded very fast.
1.2.1.3. Pro: A clipper allows to reloading a [SKS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Sr6tSZhDM) very fast.
1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.4. Pro: While mass shootings will continue to occur, reducing the access to semi-auto, external box fed magazine fed firearms will reduce the rounds per minute that mass shooters can achieve, thus lowering the casualty count.
1.4.1. Con: The natural right of self defense includes defending from a tyrannical government and the tools necessary for that. The Founders used the word "Arms" in the second amendment because they where explicitly speaking of military stile weapons. 
Those who think it will happen under the current administration, no mater which party, are only as paranoid as those who think it can never happen are naive.
1.4.2. Pro: 75% \(167 of 222\) of firearms used in mass shootings are semi-auto, external box magazine fed firearms. Accounting for 90% \(732 out of 816\) of fatalities in mass shootings as of writing this \(02/26/2018\). [US Mass Shootings, 1982-2018: Data Investigation](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/)
1.4.2.1. Con: The fact that the most common form of gun is often used in gun crimes only demonstrates unsurprising correlation, not causality.  If bolt action guns were more popular than semi-automatic guns then presumably there would be a higher percentage of crimes using bolt-action guns.
1.4.3. Con: Rate of fire and reload times are highly negligible considering police response times.
1.4.3.1. Con: Rate of fire and reload times are not negligible when considering the time/effort it may take to 
a\) rush an attacker or
b\) flee
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Given that attackers can \(and often do\) carry more than one weapon, the ability to rush an attacker is not affected by the reload time on their primary weapon, as the secondary weapon can still be used.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: Rate of fire and reload times are not negligible in a self-defense situation either.  Given that the vast majority of gun uses in the US are defensive gun uses by citizens, banning virtually all firearms would have an overwhelmingly negative impact on the country as a whole.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Lowering response time with some form of armed guards is a universally applicable way to lower casualties with no constitutional hurdles. A [majority](http://file:///C:/Users/Jonny/Downloads/\(U\)_ActiveShooter021317_17B_WEB.PDF) of active shootings from 2000-2013 ended within 5 minutes, which is faster than response time. Roughly 14% ended within two minutes.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: The infrastructure and cost that would be required to ensure a sub-5 minute response time would be restrictive expensive.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: Creating a constant on-watch military force would severely limit the freedoms of Americans, by way of creating a militaristic state.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Con: [Most](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/01/21/75-percent-campuses-employ-armed-officers) college campuses have dedicated police forces.
1.4.3.2.2.2. Con: Providing security ensures freedoms rather than limits them. This is why armed personnel protect numerous events from parades, sporting events, speeches, schools, etc.
1.4.3.2.3. Pro: Allowing those teachers who want to to carry concealed would be the most effective way to reduce response time.
1.4.4. Con: Mass shooters typically carry multiple weapons. They don't need one gun with a particularly high rate of fire to cause a lot of damage quickly, so banning semiautomatic weapons would not reduce the number of casualties.
1.4.5. Con: A semi-auto, external fed rifle can have the exact same rounds per minute as a semi-auto, internal fed rifle.  The external box reduces the time to reload.  It does not change the rate of fire.
1.4.5.1. Con: A faster reloading time increases the rate of fire overall throughout the course of a sustained shooting. For example, there's absolutely no way to sustain the rate of fire that an AR-15 can sustain over the course of a half hour shooting with a lever action rifle or single action pistol.
1.5. Con: If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns. Meaning mass shooters will still be able to get semi-auto, external box magazine fed firearms if they try hard enough.
1.5.1. Pro: [Over twice as many mass shootings were committed with pistols than rifles.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/476409/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-weapon-types-used/) If semi-auto rifles were banned, pistols will still be the preferred weapon.
1.5.2. Con: 3 Crimes since 1934 have been committed with the usage of legally owned automatic weapons. From 1983-1992 4 of 651 law enforcement officers killed were done by machine guns \(0.006%\). Of the 2359 guns seized in the detroit area between 1991 & 1992 only 16 of them were automatic weapons \(0.7%\).
[guncite.com Crime with Legally Owned Machine Guns](http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcfullau.html)
1.5.3. Con: Sheley and Wright found that the juvenile inmates in their 1991 sample in four States preferred large caliber, high quality handguns. Just prior to their confinement: 
58% owned a revolver, usually a .38 or .357 caliber gun 
55% owned a semi-automatic handgun, usually a 9 millimeter or .45 caliber gun 
51% owned a sawed-off shotgun 
35% owned a military-style automatic or semiautomatic rifle.

[Bureau of Justice Statistics Guns Used in Crime](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/GUIC.PDF)
1.5.3.1. Con: Given that not only are juveniles not allowed to legally purchase handguns, and sawed off shotguns are illegal in general, this claim seems to inadvertently be supporting the parent's claim that criminals will obtain guns regardless of legal restrictions.
1.5.4. Pro: It is fairly easy to build your own semi-automatic rifles.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Because of home manufacturing, with tools like the [Ghost Gunner 2](https://ghostgunner.net/products/ghost-gunner), semi-automatic rifles will remain accessible.
1.5.4.2. Pro: If we permit bolt-action rifles with external box magazines and we permit semi-automatic rifles with integral magazines, then it seems likely that people could easily combine the two to create their own, semi-auto, external box rifles at home.  There'd have to be a ban on semi-auto rifles and/or a ban on external box magazines to create an effective ban on semi-auto, external box rifles.
1.6. Con: -> See 1.4.3.
1.7. Con: Such a ban would miss the point.
1.7.1. Pro: Semiautomatic weapons are not necessarily more deadly than "civilian weapons," and either type of weapon is equally deadly to a defenseless crowd.
1.7.1.1. Pro: In 2015, 134 individuals were killed/wounded in active shooter incidents \(56 killed; "one or more individuals actively engage in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area"; [Source \[PDF\]](https://ovc.ncjrs.gov/ncvrw2017/images/en_artwork/Fact_Sheets/2017NCVRW_MassShootings_508.pdf)\); total, 251 murders were committed with rifles \([FBI '15](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-20)\). Active shooting events were 0.42% of murders in '15, and rifles were involved in 1.9% of murders. From '82-'17, 43 rifles were used in 90 mass-shooting incidents \([Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/476409/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-weapon-types-used/)\). A ban would have little impact on murder and mass-shooting rates.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: This argument is about the killing capacity of semi automatic rifles, not murder and mass shooting rates.
1.7.1.2. Pro: In the close quarters of a school shooting, semi-auto handguns would be every bit as deadly as rifles and can easily sustain as high a rate of fire.
1.7.2. Con: Slowly reducing the number of arms in circulation would reduce the number of guns in the long term.
1.7.2.1. Con: Guns last for a LONG time. I have a shotgun made in 1903 and a 22 rifle made in 1945. There are 45 pistols and 1903 Springfields that saw service in WW1 and M-1 Garands that saw service in WW2 still being sold in gun stores and it's not unheard of to find muzzle loading rifles from the Civil War in a gun shop. Your plan of slowly reducing the number of legal guns in circulation would literally take centuries.
1.7.3. Pro: If you ban the sale of semi-auto rifles with an external box magazine, it will only stop the sale of new weapons and will not remove the tens of millions that are currently in private hands. Furthermore, any serious attempt to ban them will result in a massive increase in sales, rapidly swelling those numbers.
1.7.4. Pro: Banning one type of weapon ignores the underlying causes of violence.  It doesn't help anyone to trade gun deaths for bomb deaths.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Regardless of the weapon type, as long as ammunition isn't regulated mass casualties will remain.
1.7.4.1.1. Pro: Increasing the price of ammunition by forcing serial numbers be stamped on all legal bullets and shell casings would allow for trackability of ammunition as well as limit access to it.
1.7.4.1.1.1. Con: Adding cost would disproportionately restrict a fundamental right of self defense more from low income people. Are you suggesting that poor people deserve less access to rights.
1.7.4.1.1.2. Con: Serializing individual bullets without effecting performance in such a way that they can be read after firing would be a major technical hurdle.
1.7.4.1.1.3. Con: The increased cost would come with zero benefit on crime, since a $5 nail file can be used to erase bullet serial numbers.
1.7.4.1.2. Con: It would be extremely difficult to regulate home-reloads. Regulation would have to be applied to the reloading supplies and legislation would have to be extremely heavy on those who reload at home, making it unlikely to pass congress.
1.7.4.1.3. Pro: Restricting bullet access will reduce the number of bullets in circulation.
1.7.4.1.3.1. Con: Reducing the number of bullets in circulation will have zero effect on crime, but a negative effect on those who use guns lawfully.
1.7.4.1.4. Con: Reloading is not for making "unregistered" bullets. There are many reloaders in the shooting sports now  for many reasons even though bullets are not registered.
Reasons for reloading vary from cost savings to increased precision.
1.7.4.1.5. Con: Most sport shooters will use far more bullets in a day of practice or compition than most mass shooters in an attack.
Bullets are required for practice and practice is required for safety.
1.7.4.1.6. Pro: With over 300 million guns in circulation \(and they're not coming back\), it would be more beneficial to restrict sales of bullets and impose mandatory minimum sentence for making them at home.
1.7.4.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.7.4.1.3.1.
1.7.4.1.7. Con: -> See 1.7.4.1.1.2.
1.7.4.1.8. Con: Additional regulation at all is a red herring, especially in reference to reducing mass casualties.  Mass public shooting deaths per capita in Europe are [equal to those in the US](https://crimeresearch.org/2015/06/comparing-death-rates-from-mass-public-shootings-in-the-us-and-europe/), despite having no second amendment, and significantly higher restrictions across the board, and that is without taking into account mass casualties from attacks that don't involve guns \(which are a larger problem in Europe, than the US\).
1.7.4.1.9. Con: Regulating ammunition has zero benefits whatsoever on crime, and plenty of negatives on legal gun use.
1.7.4.1.9.1. Pro: Making ammunition more expensive and/or harder to obtain means that legal gun owners are able to practice less, which means there is a greater likelihood of missing in an emergency situation.  This raises danger to both the owner, and bystanders.
1.8. Con: This violates the Second Amendment, stating "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
1.8.1. Con: The quote says it should be 'regulated'. Restricting the availability of certain types of guns is therefore well within the range of permissible actions.
1.8.1.1. Con: A well regulated militia is in reference to training, rather than regulation of arms. Well regulated in this sense means disciplined, not governmental regulations.
1.8.1.2. Con: The quote says a militia should be well-regulated.  The quote does not say arms should be regulated.
1.8.2. Pro: Restricting access to weapons common among infantrymen, undermines the purpose of the Second Amendment. If no civilians have access to weapons of war then all civilians will be ill-prepared to form into well-regulated militias to defend the nation from threats both foreign and domestic should the need arise.
1.8.3. Con: -> See discussion #11720: The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution should be repealed.
1.9. Pro: Pump/lever/bolt action, external box magazine fed firearm, or a semi-auto, fixed size internal magazine fed firearm fulfill most possible use cases. Thus, semi-automatic rifles aren't needed.
1.9.1. Con: Service in a militia is impossible with only bolt, pump or lever action rifles.
1.9.1.1. Con: The case of [US v. Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Miller) hinged on the fact that Miller's shotgun was not protected by the 2nd Amendment because it was deemed as not useful in a militia. The natural conclusion is that weapons useful in a militia ARE protected. Such weapons include semi-automatic rifles with a removable box magazine.
1.9.2. Con: "Most uses" is not ALL uses. thus, there is still a need for semi-auto rifles with an external box magazine.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Use in a [militia](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/246) is one such use. Hunting dangerous game such as wild hogs is a valid use for semi-auto rifles as well. Home/self defense against multiple intruders is another. I can literally show dozens of examples of semi-auto rifles being used effectively for just such reasons.
1.9.3. Con: External box fed firearms allow hunters to quickly change the type of ammunition being fired.  This is a unique purpose that can't be fulfilled using an internal magazine.
1.9.4. Con: The second amendment uses the word "Arms" not gun or rifle, it is making specific reference to uniquely military type weapons which would give the people more leverage should that need arrive.
1.9.4.1. Con: This would include nuclear armaments.
1.9.5. Con: If this were true, police forces would opt to use those types of firearms instead of semi-auto pistols and rifles with detachable magazines.  Clearly the fact that they choose to use semi-auto weapons shows that they are better suited for the lawful use of force when a gun is required.
1.9.6. Con: If all of the purposes of a semi-auto, external box magazine fed firearm can be fulfilled by other types of firearms, there is still no point in banning them, since those other options would still be present.
1.10. Con: -> See 1.5.4.
1.11. Pro: The rounds per minute that semi-auto, external box magazine fed firearms can achieve is excessive and makes them weapons of war over being tools.
1.11.1. Con: Rapid fire of that sort is of little use other than to make your enemy take cover. A slow rate of fire with aimed shots is FAR more lethal. That is what the military teaches and it is [most definitely true.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cosc-RO_oMg)
1.11.2. Con: There isn't a specific rate of fire that makes something a "weapon of war" rather than a "tool." All weapons are designed to hurt or kill people.
1.11.3. Con: -> See 1.9.4.
1.11.4. Con: The fact that police overwhelmingly choose to use semi-auto weapons stands as extremely compelling evidence that this is not true, since the primary purpose of armed police is not to wage war on people but to enforce the law.
1.12. Con: Semi-automatic rifles are owned and used more often for legal purposes than for crime.  Therefore banning them will obviously have an overwhelmingly negative impact on the tens of millions of people who own them legally compared to the non-existent effect on the several hundred people who use them illegally per year.
1.12.1. Con: People who legally own semi-automatic rifles can keep enjoying them as long as no new weapons are sold.
