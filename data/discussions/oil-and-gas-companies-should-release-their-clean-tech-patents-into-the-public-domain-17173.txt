Discussion Title: Oil and gas companies should release their clean tech patents into the public domain

1. Oil and gas companies should release their clean tech patents into the public domain
1.1. Pro: Petrol companies have been directly responsible for the lack of CO2 emission reductions, having access to patents for cleaner technologies and doing nothing with them, while actively pressuring congress to stop looking into the same research. It is a responsibility for our future to use this information now, and give the world a better chance with the knowledge dispersed.

1.2. Pro: Releasing clean tech patents into the public domain will positively affect the image of the companies.
1.2.1. Con: It would not be a voluntary choice, as private companies have a legal duty to maximise profit to their shareholders.
1.3. Pro: Free publication of the results will promote more rapid development in clean energy tech, ultimately benefiting all the humanity.
1.3.1. Pro: Global warming [threatens](https://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/global-warming/science-and-impacts/global-warming-impacts) the lives and livelihoods of millions of people. Averting this crisis is a huge collective benefit.
1.4. Pro: The need for clean energy is too great for good ideas to be hidden from the possibility of a synergistic breakthrough.
1.5. Con: This would discourage further research and innovation into clean technology. Putting in all the effort and money to gain a competitive advantage of superior clean technology would become too risky in the future.
1.5.1. Con: This would be a voluntary decision and would only impact the clean tech patents held by oil and gas companies. It would remain possible to patent new green technology.
1.6. Pro: More technology is available to fight global warming
1.7. Con: Research was paid by the companies while they can't profit from it.
1.7.1. Con: Now, the patents are not used while they can help in getting the planet back in good health
1.7.1.1. Pro: Averting climate change could save [millions of lives](https://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/global-warming/science-and-impacts/global-warming-impacts) and is a more important aim than protecting the right to make a profit.
1.7.2. Con: The companies have been sitting long enough on these patents, they missed their chance.
1.8. Con: Public domain disrupts market mechanics, no-one will use the patents as no-one can profit from it
1.8.1. Con: A patent in itself is not the source of profit. A product built based on the patented technology is.
1.9. Pro: Public domain creates access for everyone, so it will be used by a lot of people.
1.10. Pro: These companies have been polluting the planet long enough, it's time they turn around and make it healthy again.
1.10.1. Con: Big Oil companies [have known](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/20/oil-company-records-exxon-co2-emission-reduction-patents) about climate change and the pollution they are causing for a long time, yet they have not made any steps to change. There is no reason why they would suddenly change now.
1.10.1.1. Con: This is a debate about what oil companies should do, not what they are likely to do. The fact that they have known about climate change for so long means they have a moral duty to limit its impact.
1.10.2. Con: Their customers are the main cause of the pollution, you can't hold the companies responsible for that; the market asked for these products.
1.10.2.1. Con: Oil and gas companies [lobby](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/gas-industry-spending-millions-lobbying-to-ensure-europe-is-locked-in-to-fossil-fuels-for-decades-a8028056.html) in order to prevent the adoption of renewable energy sources, depriving customers of the opportunity to choose to adopt them.
