Discussion Title: Cigarettes should be banned

1. Cigarettes should be banned
1.1. Con: The cigarette industry creates jobs and increases exports around the world
1.1.1. Con: Jobs are a social construct. Humanity can thrive in many ways; jobs don't need to be preserved just for the sake of keeping things as they always were.
1.1.2. Con: There are many other industries; presumably people who bought cigarettes would just spend their money elsewhere, creating jobs in a different area.
1.1.3. Con: Slavery used to do the same.
1.2. Pro: Cigarette ban will drastically reduce agricultural area used for tobacco cultivation, allowing it to be used for nutrient cultures or reforestation and thus benefiting the environment.
1.2.1. Con: The cultivation of tobacco takes merely 0.09% of all agricultural land in the world. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivation_of_tobacco) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_land).
1.3. Con: The best way to prohibit the purchasing of cigarettes is by exerting higher taxes on these products. Banning a product to be sold in the market is not fit to the free market ideology.
1.4. Pro: Smoking is addictive.
1.4.1. Con: Adults are traditionally allowed to do many things that contain risk or self harm. The most common approach is to ensure they are aware of the risks so they can make informed choices
1.4.1.1. Con: Not only adults are smokers. Many young people replicate behaviours of adults without realizing the risk.
1.4.2. Con: Many pain medications can be addictive but are not banned and are considered necessary for pain management
1.4.2.1. Con: Cigarettes are not considered necessary for any medical conditions though.
1.4.2.2. Con: The [Opioid Crisis](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis) stands as evidence that such medications are often over-prescribed or falsely prescribed, and as a result millions of people have become addicted to such substances and tens of thousands have died.
1.4.3. Pro: If smoking is not banned, more people will continue to become addicted and the negative impacts will continue to occur.
1.5. Con: Prohibition simply does not work. Whether one looks at historical or modern examples, the prohibition of a substance, any substance, only gives it the allure of the forbidden.
1.5.1. Con: Alcohol prohibition in the US in the early XXth century [did lessen the per capita consumption](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470475/#__sec3title), improving the public health and reducing the drunkenness-related accidents.
1.5.2. Pro: Prohibition of tobacco would result in the same disaster that prohibition of alcohol created. Criminal gangs would take over the production and sale of tobacco and they would fight constant wars with each other over territory. \(See, e.g., Mexican drug cartels, Capone's Chicago...\)
1.5.3. Con: Prohibiting the widespread use of [metamphetamin](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/crystal-meth-origins-link-back-to-nazi-germany-and-world-war-ii-a-901755.html) was very effective in Germany after WWII.
1.5.4. Con: Making something illegal generally works, such as prohibiting rape.
1.5.5. Con: The prohibition took place in a time when gang activity was especially high. This isn't the case today anymore.
1.5.5.1. Con: It remains the question whether gang activity was stimulated by prohibition. In todays cities gang activity is pretty high in areas of forbidden substances: take cocain or cannabis for instance.
1.6. Pro: Big business' commercialization of tobacco has resulted in marketing campaigns targeting children causing people to get addicted at young ages. Banning the sale but not the growth of tobacco would limit the widespread harm caused by tobacco and the industry.
1.6.1. Con: Selling cigarettes to minors is already illegal [basically everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_age) and the health risks are clearly stated on each pack of cigarettes you can legally buy.
1.7. Pro: Smoking is detrimental to the health of the smoker
1.7.1. Con: By that standard, sugar, tee or even coffee should be banned. That is a restriction on life itself. It disrespects the human as an individual capable of making their own decisions.
1.7.1.1. Con: Standard by which cigarettes should be banned is dependent on the degree of harmful effects. Sugar, tea and coffe are much less harmful to a person's health.
1.7.2. Pro: According to the Center for Disease Control, cigarette smoking is the [leading preventable cause of death](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/index.htm) in the United States.
1.7.3. Pro: 1-Smoking cigarettes kills\([Resource](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-31600118)\) . 
2-Voluntary eating/smoking/injecting substances that cause death is considered suicide. 
3-Committing suicide is a crime. 
4- crimes are illegal =\> Smoking must be illegal.
1.7.4. Con: Nicotine can also have [helpful effects](https://www.healthline.com/health/smoking/nicotine-withdrawal) on the body, such as reducing depression and irritability, improving one's mood, and enhancing both short-term memory and concentration.
1.7.5. Con: People should be responsible for their own bodies and their own health.
1.7.5.1. Con: By this logic, all the drugs are to be legalized, and benefits of this are [highly disputable](https://www.kialo.com/all-drugs-should-be-legalised-7100/7100.0=7100.1/=7100.1/comments).
1.7.5.2. Con: Healthcare for smoking related illnesses becomes a burden on tax payers and the insurance market.
1.7.5.2.1. Con: Through purchasing cigarettes smokers [contribute more](https://fullfact.org/economy/does-smoking-cost-much-it-makes-treasury/) in tax than is needed to deal with the costs of their potential health issues.
1.7.5.2.2. Con: [Statistically](http://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au/chapter-17-economics/17-2-the-costs-of-smoking) that may not be the case. Smokers generally don't live as long as the rest of the population, which means that they have less years in which to make health insurance claims. Therefore any burden they create is mitigated.
1.7.5.2.2.1. Con: The source given [states the opposite overall](http://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au/chapter-17-economics/17-2-the-costs-of-smoking).
"lost productive capacity due to premature death or smoking-associated illness \(labour costs\)" \[17.2.1\]  costs $15,592.2 million Australian dollars \(before the subtracting costs saved by death\)  \[17.2.2\]
1.7.5.2.2.2. Pro: This figure is listed as $7,583.1 million AUD.  \[[17.2.2](http://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au/chapter-17-economics/17-2-the-costs-of-smoking)\]
1.7.5.2.2.3. Con: The medical procedures and cancer treatments they undergo during their life rack up enormous costs.
1.7.5.2.3. Con: It only is a burden if the smoker chooses to not have healthcare.  Insurance companies need to be allowed to charge more for people who are shown through general physicals to be less healthy than the average based on poor health decisions \(not genetics\).  Only in conditions of immediate life threatening injury should a hospital be required to help and only under the condition of rehabilitation and health conscious support being given in return.
1.7.5.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.2.2.3.
1.7.5.2.5. Pro: In [Iran](https://financialtribune.com/articles/people/66193/municipality-kiosks-flout-ban-on-tobacco-sale), smoking causes $1.3 billion in healthcare spending.
1.7.5.3. Con: Secondhand smoke is damaging to the health of non-smokers
1.7.5.3.1. Pro: This fact is what makes the issue a moral one and also one not in the often mentioned nanny-state framework. Smoking ban is not necessarily meant to save the smokers from themselves but to save the nonsmokers from harm caused to them by smokers.
1.7.5.3.1.1. Pro: Smoking is too much of a damage to others too be seen as primarily an individual issue.
1.7.5.3.2. Con: This is an argument for banning smoking in public areas unless all present have given consent, not a complete ban
1.7.5.3.2.1. Con: Smokers prove themselves more than likely to neglect or violate such prohibitions, whereas the law enforcement officers tend to ignore such offences as too minor.
1.7.5.3.3. Pro: Being able to breath fresh air which is not polluted by the stench of inconsiderate smokers has priority over the smokers rights to smoke. I'm happy for smokers to do so if they put a plastic bag over their heads and don't polute my air!
1.7.5.3.4. Pro: Being exposed without consent is unpleasant for the senses and violates the personal space.
1.7.5.3.5. Pro: [Children and infants](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/secondhand_smoke/health_effects/index.htm) exposed to secondhand smoke can suffer asthma, respiratory infections, ear infections, and sudden infant death syndrome \(SIDS\).
1.7.5.3.6. Pro: For [adults](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/secondhand_smoke/health_effects/index.htm), secondhand smoke has been known to cause coronary heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer.
1.7.5.3.7. Pro: Secondhand smoke [increases the risk](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/secondhand_smoke/health_effects/index.htm) of both developing heart disease and having a stroke by 20-30%.
1.7.5.3.8. Con: No one is being forced to be around people while they smoke
1.7.5.3.8.1. Con: When people smoke in public areas, it's often very difficult for those around them to avoid the second-hand smoke.
1.7.5.3.8.1.1. Con: That is an argument for banning smoking in public areas, not for banning smoking
1.7.5.3.8.1.2. Pro: Some people smoke on escalators. There it is difficult to avoid the smoke.
1.7.5.3.8.2. Con: No one is to be forced to relocate themselves in order not to be affected by air pollution caused by a smoker's voluntary act.
1.7.5.3.8.3. Pro: Cigarettes are banned in most enclosed spaces, and thus fairly easy to avoid.
1.7.5.3.8.3.1. Con: Some parents smoke in their homes exposing young children with nowhere else to go to second hand smoke.
1.7.5.3.8.3.2. Con: In [Austria](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5535745/Austria-SCRAPS-smoking-ban-bars-restaurants.html) it is legal to smoke in bars and restaurants.
1.7.5.3.8.4. Con: Many smokers smoke outside buildings. Upon leaving and entering that building one has to walk through that wall of smoke.
1.7.5.3.8.5. Con: -> See 1.7.5.3.8.3.1.
1.7.5.3.9. Con: The negative health effects of inhaling some second-hand smoke are but the tip of the iceberg when compared with living in [densely populated urban areas.](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londons-air-as-bad-as-smoking-6959600.html) In more sparsely populated rural areas, smokers are easily avoided. Thus, the factor of secondhand smoke on well-being is, while not entirely negligible, trace. \(N.B. one must of course concede that controls on parents smoking around their children are still a good idea, and not subject to this argument\)
1.7.6. Pro: In Iran [20%](https://financialtribune.com/articles/people/66193/municipality-kiosks-flout-ban-on-tobacco-sale) of preventable deaths are caused by smoking.
1.7.7. Pro: There is no reason to continue supporting the willful intake of substances that are carcinogens and sources of pulmonary issues because cigarettes do more harm to more people and it only benefits people/institutions that profit from the tobacco business.
1.8. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.3.
1.9. Con: Everyone should have the right to make their own decisions in regards to their health
1.9.1. Con: The proliferation of smoking advertising and product placement creates false information - true choice can only be made when informed
1.9.1.1. Con: Many countries have laws that ensure informed decision, such as warning labels on cigarette packs. It does not call for a complete ban.
1.9.2. Con: Smokers take up beds in hospitals as well as the time of researchers who could be focused on something else
1.9.3. Con: By polluting the air and the objects around, smokers deprive non-smokers from the free choice whether to be exposed to the treat of second-hand smoking or not.
1.9.4. Pro: Denying people bodily autonomy is an [infringement](https://www.crin.org/en/home/what-we-do/policy/bodily-integrity) of basic human rights.
1.9.4.1. Con: People want autonomy to harm themselves, yet expect others to bear the cost of the concequences of their irresponsible decisions.
1.9.5. Con: The health costs are a burden on society.  Uninsured  patients drive up costs, and insured patients increase the cost of insurance for everyone.
1.9.5.1. Con: Insurance companies usually charge higher premiums for smokers.
1.9.5.2. Pro: Uninsured patients would be a drain on society in countries with socialized health care.
1.9.5.3. Con: The government will lose billions in taxes if they were to ban cigarettes.
1.9.5.3.1. Con: True, but for society it would be an overall benefit. Taxes on unhealthy products should not be meant to remain.
1.9.5.3.2. Con: Heavy taxation is meant as a deterrent not as a fiscal opportunity
1.9.5.3.3. Con: Cigarettes weigh heavily on the [healthcare system](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-costs-smoking/cigarette-smoking-costs-weigh-heavily-on-the-healthcare-system-idUSKBN0JX2BE20141219).
1.9.6. Con: -> See 1.7.5.3.
1.9.7. Con: If this was the case, then euthanasia would be allowed in cases of terminal illness. However since it remains illegal in most places, clearly autonomy in regards to personal health is not deemed necessary by society.
1.9.7.1. Pro: We are required to wear seat belts and helmets, which only benefit our own health. This also illustrates that autonomy is not always valued in society over health.
1.9.7.1.1. Con: Actually they don't. I speak from 20 years experience as a Fireman. Helmets especially - they just make it harder to find the head.
1.9.7.2. Con: In several European countries euthanasia is in fact legal and there are movements pushing for legalization in places such as the United States. Perhaps autonomy will be deemed necessary or at least valued more in the near future.
1.9.7.3. Con: Euthanasia may be illegal in some places as it requires positive actions by other people \(usually doctors\) and a complex medical and social culture. Euthanasia is not a strictly autonomous action, and the fact that it is illegal in most places does not speak to the value of autonomy in society.
1.9.7.3.1. Con: Although certain forms of Euthanasia require positive action by other people, there are forms that minimize that action by putting the burden of the act on the sick person themselves. This includes the work by Dr. Kevorkian, who only provided the means for sick people to end their own lives. As these forms also remain illegal, it is clear that the larger discussion of euthanasia is not concerned with personal autonomy.
1.9.7.4. Pro: If you are considered to be a possible [harm to yourself \(or to others\)](https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/dangerous-to-self-or-others/), you can be admitted for up to 72 hours in a psychiatric unit against your will.
1.9.7.5. Con: -> See discussion #985: Every human should have the right and means to decide when and how to die.
1.10. Con: You should be allowed to harm yourself but not others.
1.10.1. Con: -> See 1.7.5.3.
1.10.2. Con: -> See 1.9.7.
1.11. Pro: Littered cigarettes are common and can cause fires.
1.11.1. Con: The issue can be mitigated by enforcing littering laws, which are already in place in most countries. Banning cigarettes entirely is an excessive solution to this particular problem.
1.11.2. Pro: Especially in places with dry conditions, the ember from a cigarette butt is easily enough to start a brush fire.
1.11.2.1. Pro: In places like [California](https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/17/monterey-county-wildfire-sparked-by-lit-cigarette-butt-official-says/) and [British Columbia](https://globalnews.ca/news/2078250/4-brush-fires-in-west-vancouver-in-4-hours-likely-started-by-discarded-cigarettes/) there have been frequent reports of wildfires that have been started by lit cigarette butts during the dry season.
1.11.2.2. Con: Thus the onus here is on the smoker to be responsible. Plenty of people have a cigarette and dispose of it responsibly every day, and  no then fire manifests even in the driest conditions.
1.11.2.3. Con: Any number of catalysts can result in a fire when conditions are dry. Responsible individuals dispose of their cigarettes responsibly, just as responsible campers ensure the camp fire is completely doused and extinguished when they break camp.
1.11.3. Con: Littering is already illegal. If we banned everything that wound up as litter, we could not have drink or food containers, for example. Banning what is thrown out is addressing the "tool" or instrument of the transgression. Instead, address the overall behavior that applies to all tools. Littering laws do that, so banning a product because someone might throw it along the side of the road is unnecessary.
1.12. Con: -> See 1.9.5.3.
1.13. Con: Small cigarette stores will go out of business.
1.13.1. Con: Maybe yes, but this is not a problem. Selling poison is immoral, so them losing a specific source of income is no to be seen as a worry. After all, we are not worried about the livelihoods of contract killers either.
1.14. Con: Banning cigarettes while many are still addicted to them will lead many people to suffer from withdrawal.
1.14.1. Con: As difficult as it is, suffering withdrawal is better than many of the health conditions that cigarettes may cause.
1.14.1.1. Con: This is a choice that should be made by the people who will have to suffer the consequences and not by the state.
1.14.2. Pro: The [effects of withdrawal](https://www.healthline.com/health/smoking/nicotine-withdrawal#symptoms)--which can include anxiety, headaches, depression, and nausea--could potentially create serious harm to the person who is suffering from it.
1.14.2.1. Con: Withdrawal usually only lasts for a couple of weeks, so these effects are merely short-term inconveniences.
1.14.2.1.1. Con: Cravings last for years and often get exacerbated by triggers. These triggers can be extremely common in everyday life and cause suffering to the individual.
1.14.3. Con: Banning doesn't necessarily have to happen at once without warning. There could be a transition period in which people with withdrawal effects receive support.
1.14.4. Con: In order to minimize such effects, countries like [Australia](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38733502) have a long-lasting programs of gradual tobacco consumption restrictions that ultimately, but not instantly lead to complete ban.
1.15. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.2.
