Discussion Title: Should US intelligence agencies end mass data collection?

1. US intelligence agencies should stop mass data collection.
1.1. Con: There are no plausible alternatives: Mass data storage has unique security benefits that mere real-time mass surveillance or more targeted surveillance will never be able to provide.
1.1.1. Pro: Storing information enables intelligence agencies to compare data points from different periods of time and triangulate their insight.
1.1.2. Pro: It would be impossible to monitor all communications going on in real-time, so storage is necessary for intelligence analysis.
1.1.3. Pro: Analysis of large amounts of [historical information](https://www.npr.org/2013/06/15/191694315/high-tech-surveillance-targets-evolving-terrorist-tactics) can yield unique insights into the development of terrorist tactics and social patterns within their organisation.
1.1.4. Con: Improving US foreign policy is a better alternative to mass data collection.
1.1.4.1. Pro: US covert operations involving foreign countries, such as the collection of internet data from [overseas](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/06/politics/nsa-verizon-records-questions/index.html) by US security agencies has the potential to contribute to ['blowback'](https://www.thenation.com/article/blowback/), undermining national security. Therefore mass data collection is counter-productive because such a measure makes the population less safe.
1.1.4.2. Pro: The protection of civil liberties, such as the right to privacy, would not have to be compromised to the extent they have been. A better foreign policy would make the US population safer which would either remove the need for bulk data collection for security purposes, or at the very least would be significantly reduced.
1.1.4.3. Con: It is impossible to end terrorism through improving foreign policy. For example, terrorists don't fit into a diplomatic system that can be recognized by legitimate representative parties, therefore they cannot be negotiated with.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: The US has previously negotiated with terrorists.
1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: American soldier Bowe Bergdahl was released in [exchange](http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/03/the-u-s-does-negotiate-with-terrorists/) for five Taliban fighters held at the Guantanamo Bay prison.
1.1.4.3.1.2. Pro: American authorities agreed to set free Qais al-Khazali, a former spokesman for influential Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, in [exchange](http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/03/the-u-s-does-negotiate-with-terrorists/) for a British civilian held hostage by Iraqi militants.
1.1.4.4. Con: Foreign policy is stronger when backed up with the knowledge/effects made possible by bulk data collection.
1.1.5. Pro: Collecting mass data is the way to identify who a potential threat could be. Machine learning systems can only get smarter and better the more data you feed into it. It can find more patterns that way.
1.1.6. Con: It is preferable to have telecommunications firms collect and retain data. Security agencies should only access information of those who are suspected of terrorism or related to terrorism investigations. This alternative proposal allows for a more targeted approach towards security.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Monitoring everybody’s communications instead of targeting the communications of suspected terrorists has caused security agencies to [miss](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/07/18/too-much-surveillance-makes-us-less-free-it-also-makes-us-less-safe/?utm_term=.07f7bc57e1c3) real threats to national security. An example of this was the failure of intelligence agencies to prevent the Boston terrorist attack.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: The collection of too much data can mislead the algorithms that the NSA uses to sift through voice messages to find potential threats and anomalies.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Con: Traditional algorithms are [very capable](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation) of working across large datasets.
1.1.6.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: An alternative to mass data collection would be to instead use the manpower and resources on a [much more sophisticated](https://www.cepol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/26-reinhard-kreissl.pdf) examination and use of a smaller quantity of data collected.
1.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Some experts [recommend](https://www.cepol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/26-reinhard-kreissl.pdf) moving away from mass data collection, and ever-increasing monitoring, in the name of security and instead using technology and data collection to complement traditional, low tech, community monitoring and policing rather than replace them.
1.1.6.1.2.2. Pro: The thousands of false positives created by mass data collection make it impossible to isolate credible threats from innocuous threats. Targeted data collection, and extensive analysis [better enables](https://digg.com/2015/why-mass-surveillance-cant-wont-and-never-has-stopped-a-terrorist) security experts to isolate, and prevent, terror threats.
1.1.6.1.2.2.1. Pro: Mass data collection is usually just sifting through a huge amount of data with very few relevant bits of information, most of which end up to be false positives.
1.1.6.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: A report on mass surveillance during the Bush administration found that [only 1.2%](https://www.propublica.org/article/whats-the-evidence-mass-surveillance-works-not-much) of leads pursued based on data 'made a substantive contribution' to identifying a terrorist or potential confidential informant.
1.1.6.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: This is specific to an individual program called [Stellarwind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_Wind), not mass surveillance generally.
1.1.6.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: FBI agents were spending so long sifting through information that was flagged through surveillance that they are [reported](https://www.propublica.org/article/whats-the-evidence-mass-surveillance-works-not-much) to have sent back frustrated reports claiming "You are sending us garbage".
1.1.6.1.2.2.1.3. Con: Due to the confidential nature of information gathered from mass data collection, it is more likely that the role of these sources has been underestimated than is likely with more 'traditional' sources.
1.1.6.1.2.2.1.4. Pro: Investigators are [reported](https://www.liberties.eu/en/news/meandmyrights-infobesity-why-mass-surveillance-is-useless-against-terrorism/13579) to have followed up on, and interviewed, thousands of innocent individuals.
1.1.6.1.2.3. Con: Most administrative and security organizations do not have the funding or manpower to undertake an operation of this scale.
1.1.6.1.2.3.1. Con: The funding that is currently being used on mass data collection, and the manpower used to go through data collected, could be redirected to great effect in working on alternative programmes to mass data collection.
1.1.6.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Both the initial cost of implementing the mass data collection programme and the budget required to maintain the programme have been [very expensive](http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/07/news/economy/nsa-surveillance-cost/index.html). These costs are coming from taxpayers.
1.1.6.1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: The high costs associated with the mass data collection programmes create an [incentive](https://www.rt.com/news/nsa-whistleblower-mass-surveillance-398/) for the intelligence agencies and politicians to justify that expenditure even if it is not efficient because the public could be very unhappy to learn that such spending was wasted rather than redirected into other areas of public spending.
1.1.6.1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: If high costs are not providing actionable intelligence, there would be strong incentive to pause/slow the program, as it is not helping you meet your goals/targets.
1.1.6.2. Con: Telecommunications companies can [deny](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35594245) the requests of US security agencies to access their databases and thus hinder the progress of terrorism related investigations that are crucial to upholding national security.
1.1.7. Pro: Most intelligence agencies of other countries [collect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_mass_surveillance_projects) a lot of data of both their own citizens and foreign ones. It is necessary for American intelligence agencies to follow modern intelligence techniques.
1.2. Pro: Compromising liberty and privacy for the purpose of security is counterproductive.
1.2.1. Pro: The purpose of the government is to protect the freedoms granted by the US constitution, not restrict them. Curtailing civil liberties for the purpose of security serves the ideological agenda of terrorists which rejects liberalism, thus rendering such a measure counter-productive.
1.2.2. Con: Safety is a prerequisite for enjoying liberty. If an individual is not safe, it hardly matters how free they are.
1.2.2.1. Con: A good relationship between the government and its people is an essential component of good governance. If the government an guarantee the safety of their citizens, but cannot guarantee them having happiness, then life may not be worth it.
1.2.2.2. Con: Freedom and liberty are [important parts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_way) of the American lifestyle. An absence of that freedom is therefore a grave injustice.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: America's close ties with freedom have been present [historically](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-blankley/an-american-obsession-wit_b_493099.html) and have been a driving force in its conception.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: Freedom has not seen [much implementation](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/magazine/who-are-americans-to-think-that-freedom-is-theirs-to-spread.html) in the US and there has been a historical struggle of retaining freedom in government policies.
1.2.2.2.3. Con: There can be multiple possible [conceptions](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-five-conceptions-of-american-liberty) of the way Liberty sees effect in real life. Some ideas may even be in direct contradiction with each other. Therefore there is no way to establish if the freedom of privacy being infringed is in fact a very necessary one.
1.2.2.2.4. Con: American libertarian ideas sometimes [lead](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-blankley/an-american-obsession-wit_b_493099.html) to situations where free interpretation of freedom is causing active harm to the country.
1.2.2.2.4.1. Pro: Excessive demand for freedom to do whatever the public wants leads to situation like gun control becoming a massive problem in the USA. In that situation ideas like freedom to arm one's self dominates the state responsibility to protect its people.
1.2.2.2.5. Pro: America's [foundation](http://www.insideronline.org/2015/09/americas-culture-of-liberty/) was on strict principles of equality and freedom as evidenced by their importance in the Declaration of Independence. Therefore infringing that freedom is a grave harm.
1.2.2.2.5.1. Pro: By compromising on particular individual freedoms for the purpose of security opens the door for other freedoms, such as freedom of speech, to be undermined. Therefore such a compromise has damaging implications for democracy and the relationship between the state and its people.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1. Pro: Mass data collection creates a dangerous power imbalance between citizens and the government.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: Mass data collection is carried out by agencies which are ["insulated](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/why-should-we-even-care-if-the-government-is-collecting-our-data/276732/) from the political process and public accountability."
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Reviews into actions carried out by the intelligence community are confidential meaning the public never get access to transcripts or details of what took place making it impossible to [determine the quality](http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/article/fear-and-mass-surveillance-our-constitutionally-toxic-political-cocktail) of the review.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Even if there are security concerns, it would be possible for [declassified summaries](http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/article/fear-and-mass-surveillance-our-constitutionally-toxic-political-cocktail) to be provided about investigations in order to provide the public with pertinent information about what is being investigated, and how, and whether telecoms companies are cooperating with investigations. This information could help inform citizens exercise their democratic and civil rights.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: There are [reports](https://www.rt.com/news/nsa-whistleblower-mass-surveillance-398/) that suggest that even those involved in court proceeding regarding mass data collection may not be given full information about the proceedings they are required to make decisions about.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.2. Pro: Mass data collection gives the government the power to identify and supress political opponents and dissidents.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3. Con: A power imbalance is always going to exist between citizens and the government just because of the government's access to material resources, tax revenues and its ability to enact policy.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1. Con: In using all of these resources, governments are ultimately accountable to the people, so there is no real imbalance of power. Mass data collection eschews such oversight.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The nature of mass data collection makes it \(virtually\) impossible to have real regulation and oversight given the confidential nature of data collected and the operations of the intelligence community.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.5.1.1.1.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court does not allow [public hearings](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/unnecessary-and-disproportionate-how-nsa-violates-international-human-rights), which violates due process.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.3. Pro: Mass data collections operate on a system of secrecy where normal citizens are expected to trust that they are done properly. However, since there is no transparency, there is no way to gauge the limits within with intelligence agencies are operating.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.5.1.1.1.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.2.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.3.3. Pro: Despite the bad press the NSA has attracted from their mass data collection, intelligence agencies in Europe are equally, if not more, free to spy on citizens with [little regulation or oversight](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/04/german-intelligency-service-nsa-internet-laws).
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.3.3.1. Con: As a result of [heightened scrutiny](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/2015/0522/Fiercely-critical-of-NSA-Germany-now-answering-for-its-own-spy-practices) post-Snowden, Germany passed a [series of reforms](https://www.lawfareblog.com/new-rules-sigint-collection-germany-look-recent-reform) to create more oversight and limit the powers of their mass data collection agency, the BND.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Ongoing [political pressure](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/24/special-forces-need-to-face-scrutiny-from-parliament-say-mps) in the UK has also focused attention on [regulation and oversight](https://whorunsbritain.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2015/09/07/are-the-british-intelligence-and-security-agencies-democratically-accountable/) of their intelligence agencies.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.3.3.2. Pro: Similarly, UK intelligence agencies were [found guilty](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-collect-data-unlawful) of human rights violations resulting from their mass data collection.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.3.3.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.5. Pro: The mere scale of mass data collection makes any meaningful oversight practically impossible.
1.2.2.2.5.1.1.4. Pro: Mass data collection by largely autonomous agencies creates a sense of [helplessness](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/why-should-we-even-care-if-the-government-is-collecting-our-data/276732/) and powerlessness among citizens.
1.2.2.2.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.5.1.1.2.
1.2.2.3. Con: It is a slippery slope once rights start to get discarded: Eradicating an important right like privacy means that the sacred nature of rights is violated. Eradicating that sanctity may lead to the elimination of other fundamental ideas like freedom/liberty or the right to fair trial also being abandoned since the state is unwilling to respect ideals that citizens hold dear.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: The [holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust) in Germany was not an instant process. People wouldn't instantly have accepted concentration camps springing up. Rather it was a slow development towards genocide with a gradual dehumanizing of Jewish people in public and a slow eradication of their rights.
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: Stalin's [rise to power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism) included slowly purging his opponents one by one and developing stricter controls over the populace. Springing up a totalitarian state immediately post revolution in Soviet Russia would've been unsustainable. Rather it was the slow move towards totalitarianism that allowed it to be sustained.
1.2.2.3.3. Pro: [Napoleon](https://www.history.com/topics/napoleon) didn't immediately become emperor in post revolutionary France because libertarian ideas were still high. Instead he slowly rose to power and established popularity within the people before doing away with ideas like democracy and instead proclaiming himself Emperor.
1.2.3. Pro: Mass data collection encourages a culture of distrust between citizens and the government, which ultimately leads to societal instability.
1.2.3.1. Con: Mass distrust of the government [already exists](https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/04/verify-then-trust) in the modern world. The government's reputation can hardly be tarnished any further. This is especially true when the US government has performed much harsher activities in the past which trump data collection.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: The CIA experimented on human subjects under project [MKUltra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra) to research mind control under front organizations.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: The US health service [gave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment) African Americans syphilis to gauge its effects under the false pretext of providing free health care.
1.2.3.1.3. Pro: The United States government has been accused multiple times of violating international humanitarian law because of its illegal detention and inhumane treatment of prisoners in [Guantanamo Bay](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Guantanamo-Bay-detention-camp).
1.2.3.1.4. Con: Worse government policies in the past do not justify current violation of citizens' rights.
1.2.3.2. Pro: The success of a large number of public policies \(education, vaccination etc.\) depends on the citizens' [faith in the government](http://www.oecd.org/gov/trust-in-government.htm).
1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.5.1.1.
1.4. Pro: Ending mass data collection would help regain public trust in US intelligence agencies.
1.4.1. Pro: US intelligence agencies were [brought to court](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order) for infringing on the rights of citizens through mass data collection.
1.4.1.1. Con: A 2014 report from the Privacy and Civil Liberties board [stated](https://www.pclob.gov/library/215-Report_on_the_Telephone_Records_Program.pdf) that the intelligence agencies had no complaints against them of "significant intentional misuse of the system" and that there was no evidence of "bad faith or misconduct" by government officials or the US intelligence agencies.
1.4.2. Pro: When the mass surveillance of US citizens was discovered, there was [outrage](https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/6/4401654/white-house-nsa-verizon-us-call-records) on the part of companies whose data was illegally obtained, and citizens whose metadata was being stored illegally and without their knowledge.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Not only was mass surveillance discovered, but there is [evidence that suggests](https://www.wired.com/2013/09/nsa-backdoor/) the NSA deliberately created backdoor entry into internet data to aid their mass surveillance efforts.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: The [billion dollar campaign](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0) undertaken by the NSA showed disrespect for individuals and companies, and blatantly violated an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy.
1.4.3. Pro: The lack of trust in US intelligence agencies caused by previous mass data collection has had widespread ramifications because for many people, knowing the agencies behaved badly and lied to them before begs the question of what else are they being, or have been, untruthful about.
1.4.4. Con: The public is skeptical about everything. Publicly declaring that mass data collection has ended will not cause people to accept that the government has in fact stopped it and not continuing in secrecy.
1.4.5. Con: [62 percent](http://www.people-press.org/2013/06/10/majority-views-nsa-phone-tracking-as-acceptable-anti-terror-tactic/) of the US public are comfortable with the NSA intruding on privacy to investigate terrorist threats.
1.4.5.1. Con: Public support for a policy does not mean that the policy is effective.
1.4.5.2. Con: According to a [poll](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/195931-poll-public-turning-against-nsa-practices) conducted by the Pew Research Center, 53% said they opposed the government's collection of phone and Internet data as a part of a anti-terrorism efforts. From those polled, 73% believed that the proposed changes by the government to how security agencies conduct themselves would not make a difference in terms of protecting privacy.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: A study found that a majority of Americans – [56%](http://www.people-press.org/2013/06/10/majority-views-nsa-phone-tracking-as-acceptable-anti-terror-tactic/) – say the National Security Agency’s \(NSA\) program tracking the telephone records of millions of Americans is an acceptable way for the government to investigate terrorism.
1.5. Pro: Mass data collection harms tech companies and service providers.
1.5.1. Pro: Communications companies and their customers who are targeted by the mass data collection program don't have the right to intervene and contest to the decision made by security agencies to collect personal data, nor are they able to read the constitutional justification by security agencies to do so. Therefore, it is clear that the US mass data collection program violates the [right to due process](https://fedsoc.org/commentary/publications/why-nsa-s-bulk-data-seizures-are-illegal-and-unconstitutional) that is afforded by the fifth amendment.
1.5.2. Pro: Facebook alone has [reported](http://washingtonsblog.com/2014/06/surveillance-makes-us-poor.html) losing 11 million users due to privacy concerns.
1.5.2.1. Con: Facebook is responsible for invasions of privacy into its users data. This includes both selling personal data for [advertising](https://consumerist.com/2014/06/12/facebook-is-now-selling-your-web-browsing-data-to-advertisers/) and [prioritising](https://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006) political beliefs over one another.
1.5.3. Pro: The damage done to US tech companies by the NSA mass surveillance scandal is [estimated](http://washingtonsblog.com/2014/06/surveillance-makes-us-poor.html) to have cost US companies hundreds of billions of dollars.
1.5.4. Con: Most tech companies [willingly](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-data-brokers-selling-your-personal-information/) [collect](https://dataethics.eu/en/facebooks-data-collection-sharelab/) the data of their users and sell it to private advertising corporations. It is only fitting that the government does the same.
1.5.4.1. Con: [Verizon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order) was forced to send data regarding phone call lengths and IMEI numbers of their customers to the NSA.
1.5.4.2. Pro: The backlash towards US intelligence agencies collecting data is nothing short of mass hysteria. Unlike tech companies, who collect private data to increase the profit margins of their businesses, the government does so for a far greater purpose - to ensure the safety of its population from harmful threats.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: Mass data collection is a crucial pillar of US counterterrorism efforts and necessary to keep the population safe.
1.5.4.2.1.1. Con: A White House [report](http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/18/21955636-obama-task-force-calls-for-overhauls-to-surveillance-tactics?lite) concluded that the bulk collection of Americans' phone records "was not essential" to thwarting terror attacks.
1.5.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Not only was it not essential, it has been [reported](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/28/nsa-bulk-metadata-collection-expires-usa-freedom-act) that none of the data used in preventing terrorism has, to date, come from sources that would be off-limits to intelligence agencies under restricted data collection, i.e. the terrorists have always been subject of ongoing, warrant-based suspicion and monitoring, rather than mass surveillance of the general public without cause.
1.5.4.2.1.2. Pro: Phone data collection has helped thwart [multiple terrorist attacks](http://www.ibtimes.com/four-times-nsa-surveillance-programs-stopped-attack-1312309).
1.5.4.2.1.2.1. Con: It is hard to trust accounts of the intelligence community supporting mass data collection when they have a [history of lying](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/opinion/mass-surveillance-isnt-the-answer-to-fighting-terrorism.html) to the US public and have incentives to prove the efficacy of mass data collection.
1.5.4.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.2.3.1.1.1.
1.5.4.2.1.2.2. Con: Even in cases where surveillance data is used against terror suspects, these individuals are often [known previously](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/opinion/mass-surveillance-isnt-the-answer-to-fighting-terrorism.html) to law enforcement officials and the intelligence community.
1.5.4.2.1.3. Con: The retention of mass data by security agencies leaves the US vulnerable to [cyber-terrorism](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/terrorists-learn-hack), undermining national security.
1.5.4.2.1.3.1. Pro: The retention of mass data by the US government and affiliated organizations create a massive [vulnerability](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/04/16/living-in-the-grip-of-vigilance/nsa-surveillance-creates-vulnerability) to identity theft by hackers.
1.5.4.2.1.3.2. Pro: Any information held by the US government will inevitably become the target of hackers already or hoping to work for foreign governments.
1.5.4.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: As part of the hack of the [Office of Personnel Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach), Chinese hackers obtained around 21.5 million personal records.
1.5.4.2.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.5.4.2.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.5.4.2.1.6. Con: Mass data collection by US intelligence agencies has led to over-collection of data which has made the population less safe.
1.5.4.2.1.6.1. Pro: Mass surveillance has led to [hundreds of thousands of innocent](https://www.aclu.org/other/terror-watch-list-counter-million-plus) people to be placed on the US government's terrorist watch list. Such a bloated list wastes the time of security agencies and diverts their energies from looking for true terrorists endangering the safety of the population.
1.5.4.2.1.6.1.1. Pro: Bloated lists like this one [ensnare](https://www.aclu.org/other/terror-watch-list-counter-million-plus) many innocent travelers as suspected terrorists.
1.5.4.2.1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.5.4.2.1.7. Con: Mass data collection is inefficient and a waste of resources.
1.5.4.2.1.7.1. Pro: A White House [review panel](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/nsa-program-stopped-no-terror-attacks-says-white-house-panel-f2D11783588) on the NSA's mass data collection program found that it had not prevented any terrorist attacks.
1.5.4.2.1.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.2.1.2.
1.5.4.2.1.7.1.2. Con: According to the same article, Geoffrey Stone said that the mass collection of telephone call records was a “logical program” from the NSA’s perspective and could have been useful in principle.
1.5.4.2.1.7.1.3. Pro: Intelligence officers have [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/opinion/mass-surveillance-isnt-the-answer-to-fighting-terrorism.html) that often the issue in preventing terror attacks is not lack of information on suspects, but an issue with determining how and when to act on the 'sheer numbers' of individuals known to the law enforcement/ the intelligence community.
1.5.4.2.1.7.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.2.2.1.
1.5.4.2.1.7.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.5.4.2.1.7.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.2.1.2.2.
1.5.4.2.1.7.1.4. Con: The presence of mass surveillance techniques means that perpetrators are less likely to attack in the first place. This effect can't be accurately measured but exists as a benefit nonetheless.
1.5.4.2.1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.2.2.1.
1.5.4.2.1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.2.3.1.1.
1.5.4.2.1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.5.4.2.1.7.5. Con: According to an independent [report](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/02/nsa-data-collection-legal-independent-board), a set of the NSA data collection programs were declared as "legal and effective in protecting national security".
1.5.4.2.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.
1.5.4.3. Con: Users [consent](https://www.fff.org/2014/03/04/private-vs-government-data-collection/) to have their data collected when they use the technology and services from companies. With government data collection, there is no consent.
1.5.4.4. Con: [Advertising corporations](https://www.fff.org/2014/03/04/private-vs-government-data-collection/) employ user information to try to market user specific products and services. Governments have more power to use the information maliciously.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.2.1.7.
1.7. Pro: Mass data collection threatens civil liberties.
1.7.1. Pro: The fourth amendment of the US constitution does [not permit](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/22/nsa-bulk-data-collection-constitutional-rights-aclu) the NSA to place hundreds of millions of innocent people under permanent surveillance for the purpose of targeting a small number of specific individuals.
1.7.1.1. Con: The NSA operates under the assumption that bulk data collection is not permanent surveillance, but [necessary and relevant](https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/17/nsa-spying-justification-declassified/) surveillance of individuals endangering national security.
1.7.2. Pro: Mass data collection has [enabled overreach](http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/article/fear-and-mass-surveillance-our-constitutionally-toxic-political-cocktail) by the intelligence community, ranging from mismanaging data collected to ignoring court orders coming from the FISA court.
1.7.2.1. Con: This implies that there needs to be better regulation and oversight of the intelligence community but this is possible while still allowing mass data collection.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.
1.7.2.2. Pro: The intelligence community have ignored/ [circumvented laws](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/opinion/mass-surveillance-isnt-the-answer-to-fighting-terrorism.html) aimed to prevent their overreach as well as capitalising on vague legislation and nontransparent justice proceedings.
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: The laws regarding mass data collection are currently vague, with [confusion](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-big-data-privacy-20140502-story.html) surrounding how to apply laws to data from newer technologies and unhelpful loopholes created by incomplete attempts to reform out-dated Privacy Acts to address such confusion on how to apply "archaic" laws to a rapidly-changing world of technology and mediums of communication.
1.7.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.
1.7.2.2.3. Pro: One example is the CIA's [internal review](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/world/senate-intelligence-commitee-cia-interrogation-report.html) that showed CIA intelligence officers hacked into the Senate Intelligence Committee to 'spy' on an investigation into their operations.
1.7.3. Pro: There is a revolving door between the government and the private sector. It is inevitable that intelligence practices will be [privatized and capitalized](https://www.thenation.com/article/how-private-contractors-have-created-shadow-nsa/). This poses a special risk to human autonomy that would normally be tempered by a sovereign lawful entity.  The private use of user data to survey, predict, and subsequently modify behavior using psychometric tools constitutes an act of [psychological warfare](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage) against the general public.
1.7.4. Pro: The government can use mass data against individuals who hold political views counter to the government's. For instance, the purpose of the IRS is to collect taxes and fund the government, but they used their [position and tax payer information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRS_targeting_controversy) to [scrutinize conservative nonprofits](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/27/560308997/irs-apologizes-for-aggressive-scrutiny-of-conservative-groups).
1.7.5. Pro: Mass data collection violates the right to privacy.
1.7.5.1. Pro: US law is very clear in defining what a person's reasonable expectation to privacy entails, and has gone to great lengths to protect that right as technology develops. Allowing mass data collection via social media and the internet is failing to protect the individual's reasonable expectation to privacy in the 21st century.
1.7.5.1.1. Pro: In light of the phone surveillance scandal, the intelligence agencies were [ordered](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/28/nsa-bulk-metadata-collection-expires-usa-freedom-act) to cease their collection of the metadata of US citizens' phone calls within 180 days of the Freedom Act being passed into law.
1.7.5.1.1.1. Pro: Similar legislation could be passed to ensure the internet metadata of citizens would only be obtainable from service providers if there is an ongoing investigation into that person.
1.7.5.1.2. Con: According to the NSA, their database of phone records can only be sifted through when there is "[reasonable suspicion](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/06/the_nsa_s_phone_call_database_a_defense_of_mass_surveillance.html)" regarding specific individuals.
1.7.5.1.2.1. Pro: Since each individual does not know whether their data is being sifted through or not, there is no way to check if the NSA is actually following guidelines.
1.7.5.1.2.1.1. Con: All US Intelligence agencies are subject to [oversight and audit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community_Oversight).
1.7.5.1.2.1.2. Con: The NSA has to acquire a warrant from the [FISA](https://www.ajc.com/news/national/what-fisa-warrant/WqP428Eg04nHe933u1GazO/) court for targeted surveillance.
1.7.5.1.2.1.2.1. Con: The FISA court is actually a closed security cleared tribunal.  Without transparency the [public cannot check if the courts decisions are fair](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2018/02/27/law-clinic-pushes-for-fisa-court-transparency/).
1.7.5.1.2.2. Con: The NSA has [broken the law](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-23721818) on multiple occasions and are not controlled by democratic power. Therefore you can not trust their policy regarding data privacy.
1.7.5.1.2.2.1. Con: Many breaches are [operator and systems errors](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-broke-privacy-rules-thousands-of-times-per-year-audit-finds/2013/08/15/3310e554-05ca-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.8bc0ebc0927e), both of which might not be malicious, but just honest mistakes.
1.7.5.2. Con: Intelligence agencies only [looked at](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/28/nsa-bulk-metadata-collection-expires-usa-freedom-act) a small fraction of phone data while that was legal in the USA and never looked at the content of calls.
1.7.5.2.1. Con: Even the metadata - location of call, participants in a call, length of call, time and date of the call - violates a person's privacy and allows those with access to it to build a [profile](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/28/nsa-bulk-metadata-collection-expires-usa-freedom-act) of the person.
1.7.5.2.2. Con: The possession of data in and of itself constitutes a violation of privacy.
1.7.5.2.2.1. Con: The government is already in the possession of a huge amount of data about users. This includes banking information, private relationships, social security numbers etc. If one can rely upon the government to use that information properly, further acquisition of information should not be problem.
1.7.5.3. Con: [62 percent](http://www.people-press.org/2013/06/10/majority-views-nsa-phone-tracking-as-acceptable-anti-terror-tactic/) of US citizens think it is more important to investigate terrorist threats even if that entails intruding on privacy.
1.7.5.3.1. Con: A lot of data collected by intelligence agencies [is of foreign citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act) and includes sifting through a lot of private and personal information.
1.7.5.4. Pro: According to the American Civil Liberties Union \(ACLU\), the NSA's bulk data collection [violates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/22/nsa-bulk-data-collection-constitutional-rights-aclu) the constitutional rights to freedom of association and privacy.
1.7.6. Pro: By conducting searches of personal information without a warrant or reasonable cause, mass data collection violates the right to due process.
1.7.6.1. Con: The right to due process is not a fundamental human right. However, the right to life is. Due process can be, and often is discarded by governments if they feel the need is dire enough.
1.7.6.2. Pro: In the United States, the right to due process is [recognised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process#United_States) as granting citizens four main protections: the right to fair procedures in the justice system, to not be subject to vague laws, to have protection from government interference with citizens' rights and to have particular rights as set out in the amendments \(religion, free speech etc.\). Mass data collection threatens, or even violates, these protections.
1.7.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.2.1.
1.7.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.7.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.2.
1.7.7. Con: There is no inherent good to civil liberties.
1.7.7.1. Con: All civil liberties are good things.

Civil liberties include the [freedom of conscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_conscience), [freedom of press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_press), [freedom of religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion), [freedom of expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_expression), [freedom of assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly), the right to [security and liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty), [freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech), the [right to privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy), the [right to equal treatment under the law and due process](http://equal treatment under the law), the [right to a fair trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial), and [the right to life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life).
1.7.7.2. Con: The right to privacy is instrumental in protecting autonomy and moral personhood.
1.7.7.2.1. Pro: Privacy helps secure one's [“inviolate personality”](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/#PriHumDig) which defines one’s essence as a human being. Without privacy, it is difficult or even impossible to develop an independent moral personality. The knowledge of someone else scrutinizing or judging your private life and beliefs stifles this development.
1.7.7.2.2. Con: Lack of privacy exists in a lot of professions e.g. a soldier at deployment. This does not mean that the soldier's dignity or worth is demeaned. Some might even see it as being elevated since that person has willingly given up a freedom.
1.7.7.2.2.1. Con: People understand what they will give up when voluntarily joining professions like the military. People do not have the ability to consent to having their data collected by the government.
1.7.7.2.3. Pro: Invasions of privacy can be harmful to a person's identity and degrade their sense of dignity.
1.7.7.2.4. Pro: Every person has certain foundational human rights, and one key way that these rights are protected is by securing the ability to maintain some degree of privacy.
1.7.8. Con: Governments always have to balance civil liberties with the safety interests of their citizens.
1.7.8.1. Pro: A study has found that nearly four in five [\(78%\)](http://news.gallup.com/poll/6196/which-freedoms-will-americans-trade-security.aspx) Americans are willing to give up certain freedoms to gain security,
1.7.8.1.1. Pro: [30%](http://news.gallup.com/poll/6196/which-freedoms-will-americans-trade-security.aspx) of the participants in the study favor making it easier for legal authorities to access private communications such as mail, e-mail and telephone conversations.
1.7.8.2. Con: That is why governments have standards like warrants that allow for specific citizens' rights to be abridged when there is a just cause. Mass data collection improperly balances rights by imposing a cost on all citizens without due cause.
1.7.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.
1.7.8.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.7.8.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.5.1.
1.7.8.5. Pro: Security measures implemented by the government that balance civil liberties with the safety interests of its citizens are temporary, not permanent.
1.7.8.6. Pro: National security is essential to allow people the freedom to exercise their rights safely. If people are under a constant threat of attack, then their ability to practice their rights is hindered. Therefore the government must balance civil liberties with the safety interests of their citizens.
1.7.8.6.1. Pro: Without national security, no citizens have the capability to exercise their right to privacy, as the sovereignty of the state and safety from internal and external threats give citizens the environment in which to contextualize their rights.
1.7.8.7. Pro: The government is democratically elected by its citizens, therefore it has a mandate to implement measures that balance civil liberties with the safety interests of its citizens.
1.7.8.8. Con: If the US government cared about balancing civil liberties with the safety interests of its citizens, then it would have banned the purchasing of firearms. More people have died due to gun related violence, than as a result of terrorism. Therefore the government has no moral grounds to decide which civil liberties should or should not be compromised for the purpose of security.
1.7.8.8.1. Pro: Of the 32,000 people shot to death every year, 11,000 are [murdered](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/lax-u-s-gun-controls-pose-a-greater-threat-than-terrorism/). That's more deaths in a single year than those killed on 9/11.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.5.4.2.1.
1.9. Con: The vast majority of the data stored will never be looked at by anyone anyway, so it does not hurt anyone.
1.9.1. Con: How often the vast majority of the data stored is looked at is irrelevant. The issue is that of consent. By not being given the choice to consent to your personal data being collected violates the rights granted by the fourth amendment of the US constitution.
1.9.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.
1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.2.1.3.
1.9.3. Con: The NSA has had a history of security breaches and [leaks](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/us/nsa-shadow-brokers.html). Collecting and storing mass data exposes millions to the danger of leaks and breaches.
1.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.2.
1.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.1.2.
1.9.6. Con: Waiting for data to be misused by giving it in the hands of people is not a very good idea. The multitude of data present can be exploited by government employees or agencies at any point.
1.9.6.1. Pro: Government employees are human beings. Human beings have a tendency to commit crimes and misuse private information for such purposes such as blackmail. It seems only logical that government employees could do the same, and have done so in the past.
1.9.6.1.1. Pro: Media reported that NSA employees used the information and technology they had access to in order to spy on their [spouses and ex-lovers](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-surveillance-watchdog/nsa-staff-used-spy-tools-on-spouses-ex-lovers-watchdog-idUSBRE98Q14G20130927).
1.9.6.2. Pro: Much of the data collected is confidential so there's no way to determine who has had access to your data and what is being done with it.
1.9.6.3. Con: -> See 1.7.5.2.2.1.
1.9.7. Con: [Chinese government](https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/13/china-cctv-bbc-reporter/) officials say the same about their mass data collection, but the possession of the data generates implicit pressure on Chinese citizens.
