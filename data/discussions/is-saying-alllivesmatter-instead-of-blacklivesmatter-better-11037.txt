Discussion Title: Is Saying #AllLivesMatter Instead of #BlackLivesMatter Better?

1. Saying #AllLivesMatter instead of #BlackLivesMatter is better
1.1. Pro: Not everything has to be about race. Some feel that once they've brought the words "race" and "racism" into the discussion that they've won the debate.
1.1.1. Con: The material property of color similarities is widely used and certainly more obvious than any methaphorical or abstract meaning of the word.
1.1.2. Con: Some things are about race. For instance, the [disproportionate sentencing of black Americans](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2015/08/racial_disparities_in_the_criminal_justice_system_eight_charts_illustrating.html) and other issues which the Black Lives Matter movement represents.
1.1.2.1. Pro: [Every study](https://www.theroot.com/heres-how-many-people-police-killed-in-2017-1821706614) [ever done](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5388955/) has shown that [police force](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/02/the-role-of-structural-racism-in-police-violence/553340/) is [disproportionate](https://www.vox.com/cards/police-brutality-shootings-us/us-police-racism) against [people of colour](https://source.wustl.edu/2018/02/police-kill-unarmed-blacks-often-especially-women-study-finds/) than those who are [white](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/police-respect-whites-blacks-traffic-stops-language-analysis-finds). Many of these studies took into account multiple variables, isolating and grouping similar instances \(from routine traffic stops to police shooting someone unarmed\).
1.1.2.1.1. Con: [This source](https://www.theroot.com/heres-how-many-people-police-killed-in-2017-1821706614) is not a study, but an opinion piece that presents statistics in a biased way, and uses numbers without context.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: [This source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5388955/) doesn't demonstrate that the police use disproportionate force against people of color.  It simply assumes that this is true, and discusses ways that this would be harmful.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: [This source](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/02/the-role-of-structural-racism-in-police-violence/553340/) argues that structural racism contributes to the disproportionate use of force by police.  It does so by pointing out that police are more likely to be violent with black people in states where black people are more segregated, more incarcerated, less educated, and poorer in economic terms.  This could also be interpreted to present alternative explanations for the supposedly racially motivated violence.
1.1.2.1.4. Con: [This source](https://www.vox.com/cards/police-brutality-shootings-us/us-police-racism) doesn't address use of force, but incarceration.  Even so, this source claims that most of the disparity is due to factors such as poverty and unemployment.
1.1.2.1.5. Con: [This source](https://source.wustl.edu/2018/02/police-kill-unarmed-blacks-often-especially-women-study-finds/) claims that "the odds of being killed by police when unarmed were about the same for black and white males."
1.1.2.1.6. Con: [This study](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/police-respect-whites-blacks-traffic-stops-language-analysis-finds) purports to identify how respectful officers are by studying language patterns which don't necessarily indicate respect or disrespect.  It does not address use of force at all.
1.1.2.1.7. Con: When controlling for other variables \(such as age, income, and education\), the effect of race on satisfaction with the police [disappears entirely or is substantially reduced](https://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/legitimacy/Pages/welcome.aspx).
1.1.2.1.8. Pro: Black Americans, in particular, are a [third](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=4779) more likely than whites to be stopped by police, up to a [third](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/pbtss11.pdf) more likely to be ticketed during a stop, and three times more likely to be searched. They’re also as much as three times more likely to be subject to the use of force, with [one study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0141854) finding that unarmed black people are almost three-and-a-half times more likely to be shot by police than unarmed whites
1.1.3. Con: A discussion based on race is inherently about race. Black people have the right to decide which things affect them.
1.2. Con: Both sayings are equally harmful, as they each reduce complex issues to hollow and divisive platitudes.
1.2.1. Con: All slogans are used to reduce complex issues, but not all slogans are harmful, some create an impact and with it social change.
1.2.1.1. Con: Even if a slogan creates an impact, there is no reason to believe that the impact will be positive.
1.2.2. Pro: Reducing complex issues to single-sentence rallying cries like this encourages people to take sides rather than listen to each other.
1.2.3. Pro: Given how contentious the phrases are, it would be wise to back away from them: they have been too tainted by the controversy to be effective phrases any longer.
1.2.4. Pro: It's not only black people who have suffered hardship. Other races, including white people, have had their fair share of hardship. Singling out "black lives" is unfair.
1.2.4.1. Con: In other situations, focusing on one particular problem is not considered unfair even though many other problems exist in the world. For example, it is not considered unfair to focus on raising money for breast cancer even though other cancers also exist.
1.2.4.2. Con: Black Lives Matter does not imply and is not intended to imply that only the lives of African Americans matter. It means that those lives matter in addition to the lives of white individuals.
1.2.4.3. Con: This is a fallacy of relative privation. Dismissing an argument or complaint due to the existence of more important problems in the world, regardless of whether those problems bear relevance to the initial argument.

Just because other groups have suffered oppression, does not lessen or even apply to this argument, and only serves as a mechanism to misguide the argument.
1.3. Con: If all lives truly mattered, there would be no need for the Black Lives Matter organisation to even be started. The purpose is to point out how they are treated differently, and how they need solutions to their race specific difficulties.
1.3.1. Pro: "Black Lives Matter" is in part about getting non-black people to see things from black people's perspective. This is needed because black people are systematically disadvantaged in a variety of ways. In contrast, "All Lives Matter" is simply a reaction against having to change one's perspective. It is not a call for empathy, but a call for deliberately ignoring those deserving of more empathy.
1.3.2. Con: Attributing differences in treatment by the police to race ignores other variables such as whether or not the recipient of force resisted or attacked police officers.
1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.4. Pro: The USA is a democracy, and most Americans don't agree with the "Black Lives Matter" movement.
1.4.1. Con: There was no vote held on this matter. This claim presumes population opinion awareness, but that information is not available anywhere. At best they are speaking for themselves, their community, or what they have percieved as true.
1.4.2. Pro: According to an [August 2015 poll](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/august_2015/black_lives_matter_or_all_lives_matter), 78% of likely American voters said that the statement 'All Lives Matter' was "close\[r\] to \[their\] own" point of view than 'Black Lives Matter' was. Only 11% said that the statement Black Lives Matter was closer. Nine percent said that neither statement reflected their own point of view.
1.4.3. Con: This only suggests that it is more popular to say All Lives Matter. It does not mean it is better.
1.4.4. Con: People voted for the Nazis; this does not make the viewpoint any less problematic.
1.4.5. Con: The USA is a representative republic.
1.4.5.1. Pro: The US constitution protects the rights of a minority to express an opinion even if it is not supported by the majority.
1.4.6. Pro: President Donald Trump has stated that "Black Lives Matter" is a divisive term and that the term is inherently racist.
1.4.6.1. Con: President Donald Trump is [racist](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-racist-examples_us_56d47177e4b03260bf777e83) and [divisive](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/18/politics/nbc-wsj-poll-march-18/index.html). As such his opinion means nothing.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: Trump's alleged racism and divisiveness doesn't reflect the truth that Black Lives Matter is an inherently divisive phrase.
1.4.6.1.2. Pro: His neglect in dispelling hateful supporters \(KKK, white nationalists, and neo-Nazi groups\) while claiming that a civil rights group is racist shows a clear bias.
1.4.6.2. Con: The President of the United States should not necessarily be held as the final or even a good authority on whether or not something is good or "best."
1.4.6.2.1. Pro: The president holds no direct authority on ethical matters other than imposing laws with may affect that. His opinion bears no more importance than anyone else on the matter, nor does he have any kind of credentials to suggest that he has any kind of superior understanding of social issues.
1.5. Pro: All lives actually do matter. If you believe in equality, you should believe that black and white lives are equal, and saying "all lives matter" should not be a problem.
1.5.1. Con: All lives do matter. If you believe in equality, you should believe that black lives also matter, and saying "black lives matter" should not be a problem. However, it's clear by the reaction to the two statements that the societal contexts, meanings, and group identifications expressed by #ALM and #BLM are different.
1.5.2. Con: Therefore, black lives matter.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Black lives do not need to be singled out as mattering more than other lives. We should be stating "Latino Lives Matter", "Asian Lives Matter", "Native American Lives Matter" and "White Lives Matter" as well.
1.5.3. Con: All lives do matter, but it is necessary to focus specifically on black lives for the time being, as it is very apparent that our policing and judicial systems don't know that.
1.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.
1.5.4. Con: "Black Lives Matter" as a statement does not impose that every other life is of any lesser importance, nor does the BLM movement. It just states the context. In fact it more so states that black lives seem to currently matter less to people. Saying all lives matter in fact implies that black lives matter also, but the implications of the movement seem to be solely aimed at retaliating against BLM.
1.5.5. Con: This argument was never popularly used to oppose the BlueLivesMatter movement, which is a countermovement with much of the same support of the AllLivesMatter movement.
1.6. Pro: The Black Lives Matter movement should be acknowledged as a terrorist organisation. In 2015, Kentucky State Trooper Joseph Cameron Ponder, 31, was [shot and killed](https://bearingarms.com/bob-o/2015/09/15/black-lives-matter-thug-murdered-ky-state-trooper-trying-help/) in cold blood by Joseph Thomas Johnson-Shanks, a Black Lives Matter protester. This is not an isolated incident, several other assassinations have also occurred.
1.6.1. Con: The suspect in that case was fleeing arrest over a suspended license. He did not assassinate the trooper.
1.6.2. Con: By this logic, the police should equally be acknowledged as a terrorist organization. Numerous police officers have killed unarmed civilians. None are isolated incidents either. Black Lives Matters is the result of these murders.
1.6.2.1. Con: Shootings by police officers are normally isolated incidents.  The officers involved generally do not have a direct connection to other officers involved in shootings.
1.6.2.2. Con: The Black Lives Matter is largely a result of the killing of [Michael Brown](https://www.circa.com/story/2017/08/09/politics/three-years-after-michael-browns-death-whats-next-for-black-lives-matter). Immediately prior to his death, Michael was [attacking](https://nypost.com/2014/08/19/witnesses-say-ferguson-teen-attacked-cop-before-shooting/) the officer who shot him.
1.7. Con: They are both equally good if and when used in the context of improving and protecting the lives of human beings.
1.7.1. Con: #AllLivesMatter would only be good if it had been invented separate to the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Instead, it was in direct response and is [widely regarded as criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Lives_Matter) of the BLM tag.
1.7.1.1. Pro: All Lives Matter is notably a countermovement. It serves to negate the claims made by Black Lives Matter.
1.7.2. Con: ["Black Lives Matters" encourages protests and political action to reduce police brutality and reduce systematic racism.](https://elephrame.com/textbook/BLM)["All Lives Matters" encourages protests against "Black Lives Matters". "All Lives matters" does not encourage protests to reduce police brutality and reduce systematic racism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Lives_Matter) Therefore, saying #AllLivesMatters is worse because it does not improve the world.
1.7.3. Pro: Being pro-black is not the same as being anti-white.
1.7.4. Con: The All Lives Matter movement is a backlash to Black Lives Matter in that it assumes that BLM is lobbying for special treatment. In being such it attempts to negate the worth of the BLM movement in its entirety. It cannot be "good" and negate the notion that some of the "all lives" which are supposed to matter are being actively discriminated against.
1.7.4.1. Con: The phrase "All Lives Matter" can be used in a good context, regardless of the All Lives Matter "movement" and its intentions.
1.8. Con: Black Lives Matter inherently includes all lives, as it is expressing that black lives matter also, meaning that all the other lives already mattered before the movement felt the need to express that black lives matter too.
1.8.1. Con: "Black Lives Matter" does not inherently include all lives. It explicitly states black lives without any emphasis to suggest that other groups matter. For example, if the movement was entitled "Black Lives Matter Too", it would suggest inclusivity.
1.8.2. Pro: It is a strawman argument to argue that saying "Black Lives Matter" is inferring that only black lives matter. It only serves to misrepresent the argument, and in making the claim one remains naive, wilfully or not, to their platform.
1.8.2.1. Con: "Black Lives Matter" is itself strawman argument. There isn't a modern police department anywhere in the U.S. that claims black lives don't matter.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: It is regrettable that their actions do not reflect this belief.
1.8.2.1.1.1. Con: This is an oversimplification.  The nature of the police's job is that they are sometimes violent, and this violence has been directed against people of all races.
1.8.2.1.1.2. Con: Some of their actions reflect this belief, some do not. Police officers are individuals, and trying to hold all of them accountable for the actions of a few is as unfair and counterproductive as racial stereotyping.
1.8.2.2. Con: Clarifying a platform when their stated motto seems unclear is not an invalid argument.
1.9. Pro: #BlackLivesMatter is a racist and divisive term.
1.9.1. Pro: It deliberately excludes other minority groups, at the same time - say, for example, Asian minorities.
1.9.2. Pro: Dividing people along racial lines promotes enmity between different races.
1.9.2.1. Con: Police brutality is what promotes enmity between races. Black people do not feel safe on US streets compared to how other races feel. Black Lives Matter tries to redress the balance of equality by elevating black lives to the expected standard of respect.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: Allegations of police brutality are often unfounded.
1.9.2.1.1.1. Pro: Michael Brown was originally alleged to have been shot while putting his hands up to peacefully surrender.  Forensic evidence supports Officer Wilson's account that Michael Brown attacked him and that they struggled for control of Officer Wilson's gun before it was fired. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown)
1.9.2.1.2. Con: Some black people may not feel safe around the police, while others may. No one person or organization is qualified to speak for an entire race.
1.9.2.1.3. Con: Police brutality is not the only source of racial enmity. Pretending that it is ignores many other serious problems that have nothing to do with the police.
1.9.2.1.4. Con: The best predictor of whether or not the police will be content with a person is resistance, not race.
1.9.2.1.4.1. Con: There have been many examples caught on camera where the police have still arrested, assaulted or killed a black person who has not demonstrated any signs of resistance. The shooting of Michael Brown is a prime example as he had his hands up when he was shot.
1.9.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Just because someone is not resisting arrest does not mean that can't be arrested.
1.9.2.1.4.1.2. Con: Michael Brown's shooting was not caught on video.
1.9.2.1.4.1.3. Con: The "fact" that Michael Brown had his hands up in "surrender" is in dispute. According to the police, Michael Brown was attacking the officer who shot him.
1.9.2.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.1.1.1.
1.9.2.1.4.1.4. Con: There have not been many such examples.
1.9.2.1.4.2. Con: Even if a black person is not resisting arrest, racist tendencies will often cause a person to believe that a black person is resisting even if they are not.
1.9.2.1.4.2.1. Con: Saying that racist tendencies could cause a misperception is not evidence of racist tendencies among the police.
1.9.2.1.4.3. Pro: When police brutality does occur, it is not necessarily racially motivated or directed towards black people.
1.9.3. Pro: Saying that black lives matter actually tells people that there is a difference in how life value is perceived, and thus is keeping alive the very opinion it's fighting. It creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.
1.9.3.1. Con: It is not a self-fulfilling prophecy or a prophecy at all, when a lower perceived value of black lives is already in [evidence](https://www.vox.com/cards/police-brutality-shootings-us/us-police-racism).
1.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.
1.9.5. Con: Divisiveness does not mean that an idea is bad. Freeing slaves was divisive during the lead up to the Civil War. It is, nonetheless, considered a good idea to not allow slavery.
1.9.5.1. Con: Divisiveness is not inherently wrong, but divisiveness and exclusion along specifically racial lines is.
1.9.5.1.1. Con: Black Lives Matter does not exclude anyone based on racial lines.
1.9.5.1.1.1. Con: [They do.](https://www.dailywire.com/news/16976/segregation-all-rage-black-lives-matter-groups-amanda-prestigiacomo)
1.9.6. Con: It would be a racist term if it implied superiority, but it is a simple statement. It is not #BlackLivesMatterMost. It is only divisive to the degree that people already are divided in ideas about race and the existence of structural racism.
1.10. Con: The phrase "All Lives Matter" is often used by people to deny that racism against black people exists.
1.10.1. Pro: Although all life is valuable, black lives are the ones under suppression and being discriminated against so the focus must be on them.
1.10.1.1. Con: Black people are not the only people who are discriminated against.
1.10.2. Pro: People who say "All Lives Matter" don't really believe that all lives matter. They are just using it as a response against the "Black Lives Matter" movement. It is a tactic deliberately designed to derail the conversation about racial equality in the USA.
1.10.2.1. Con: Not all people saying #AllLivesMatter are saying it as a challenge to the #BlackLivesMatter campaign. Some are saying it in conjunction with the #BlackLivesMatter campaign. The context in which someone is saying #AllLivesMatter is important.
1.10.2.1.1. Con: #AllLivesMatter was a direct response to #BlackLivesMatter, and served an argumentative purpose.
1.10.2.2. Pro: When a house is on fire, no one shouts that "all houses matter". Instead, they just water the one that's on fire. Black people represent the house which is on fire. [#AllHousesMatter cartoon](http://chainsawsuit.com/comic/2016/07/07/all-houses-matter-the-extended-cut/)
1.10.2.3. Pro: Saying "All Lives Matter", even though it is \(or should be\) true, is a kind of trolling. It is akin to how the "Blue Lives Matter" hashtag became popular as a response to Beyonce's halftime performance speaking out against police brutality.
1.10.2.3.1. Con: The statement black lives matter did not rise from a philosophy about life, but from a specific cause which rising from a specific group of people, their statement is not to say that only black lives matter, it is to highlight that there is reason to act specifically in the black cause
1.10.2.3.2. Con: Neither "All Lives Matter" nor "Blue Lives Matter" are trolling.  Both statements are used to oppose ideas that are being perceived as the harmful components of the Black Lives Matter message.
1.10.2.4. Pro: All Lives Matter is a movement in direct response to Black Lives Matter, and thus All Lives Matter serves as an argument against Black Lives Matter. Saying that All Lives Matter as a way to retaliate is a strawman argument, through misrepresenting the intended meaning of Black Lives Matter, based on the intended meaning of the All Lives Matter movement.
1.10.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.8.2.1.
1.10.2.4.2. Pro: "All lives matter" is an ineffective rhetorical device, since it is in the same frame as the original "Black lives matter" claim. It would be more effective to use a slogan unrelated to the original thesis, like "It's OK to be white."
1.10.2.4.2.1. Con: All lives matter is effective as a counterargument specifically because it is framed in terms singular to black lives matter.
1.10.3. Pro: Historical discrimination cannot be resolved by just removing the source of discrimination. An inverse discrimination \(albeit, progressively diminishing and only for a calculated time\) is required to make it really equitable.
1.10.3.1. Con: There is no practical way to calculate a level of discrimination to be intentionally applied, to progressively diminish intentional discrimination, or to effectively end it at its planned conclusion.
1.10.3.2. Con: Two wrongs don't make a right.
1.10.3.3. Con: The people benefiting from "inverse" discrimination would not be the same people who historically suffered.
1.10.4. Pro: A [famous photo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/All_Lives_Matter_%2825951086405%29.jpg) exists of a white man with a sign saying "All Lives Matter - Go home & get a job"; this demonstrates how racism is undermined by using #AllLivesMatter.
1.10.5. Con: We should not let people who deny racism decide how a phrase is used or understood, otherwise, we are allowing racists to control our language. All lives should matter whether or not racism deniers also use the term.
1.10.5.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.
1.10.5.2. Con: We cannot escape the fact that the meaning of a word or phrase is often determined by the way it is used in context, both popularly and historically, not necessarily only by its inherent meaning. The word “negro” simply means “black” in Spanish, but because of its historically racist use, most people would refrain from using it.
1.10.5.2.1. Pro: Words are arbitrary, and their popular use often becomes the defining factor of their context.
