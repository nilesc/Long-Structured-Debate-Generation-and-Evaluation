Discussion Title: Reward or Dominate: What's the best method to train dogs? 🐾

1. Positive Reinforcement is the best method to train a dog. 🐾
1.1. Con: Dominance theory is not supported by science.
1.1.1. Pro: Its most famous proponent, Cesar Millan, has been [criticized](https://www.livescience.com/5846-critics-challenge-dog-whisperer-methods.html) for the methods he uses.
1.1.1.1. Pro: National Geographic channel even shows a warning at the beginning of Millan's show urging people to "not try this at home" without consulting a professional.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Millan was under investigation for possible animal [cruelty](https://www.thedodo.com/cesar-millan-dog-pig-1647781916.html).
1.1.2. Pro: The research that established dominance theory was done on captive wolves, and is based on behavior not observed in wild packs.
1.2. Pro: Positive Reinforcement uses dogs' natural desires for training.
1.2.1. Pro: Dogs want to please their humans, and want to earn their approval. Positive Reinforcement uses this instinct to reward wanted behavior.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Rewarding behavior makes it more likely such behavior gets repeated. This principle is used by [zookeepers](https://medium.com/sciview/zookeepers-encourage-natural-animal-instincts-and-behavior-b28b998cd71d) to work with the animals they look after, and it even works in [humans](https://www.ishn.com/articles/102484-using-positive-reinforcement-for-success).
1.2.2. Pro: As dogs are driven by food and play, these incentives work best for training.
1.3. Con: Problem dogs can't be trained by Positive Reinforcement.
1.3.1. Pro: Problem dogs often [need negative reinforcement](https://www.cesarsway.com/cesar-millan/cesars-blog/reinforcement) so they can be brought to a place where positive reinforcement will work; otherwise, the dog will run riot.
1.3.2. Con: Negative reinforcement can make aggressive dogs even more aggressive; positive reinforcement [will not](https://www.thespruce.com/positive-reinforcement-dog-training-1118248).
1.4. Con: Some dog breeds only react to strength and need their human to be the leader of the pack.
1.4.1. Pro: Many people believe that some dog breeds are naturally more aggressive than others, and subsequently need a stronger hand to keep them under control.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Pit Bulls and other terriers were bred for aggressive behavior such as fighting and driving prey.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Pitbulls were [created](https://www.ukcdogs.com/american-pit-bull-terrier) in the 19th century by breeding terriers with bulldogs to combine their agility and strength.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Pitbulls were often used for [bloodsports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_bull#History) like bear-baiting and bull-baiting.
1.4.1.1.3. Con: Pitbulls are very [loyal](https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/American-Pit-Bull-Terrier/Personality.aspx) and playful dogs, who are closely attached to their human family.
1.4.1.2. Con: [Research](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/owners-not-breeds-predict-whether-dog-will-be-aggressive-180949962/) has shown that aggressive behavior can predicted by looking at the owner, rather than the dog. In other words, the way a person trains a dog says more about that dog's potential aggressive behavior that its breed.
1.4.2. Con: Aggression in dogs is [often caused by](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/canine-corner/201403/dog-aggression-is-predicted-training-methods-and-breed) the training method used. Aggressive methods make dogs aggressive towards humans.
1.4.2.1. Pro: A [study](https://positively.com/articles/aggressive-training-breeds-aggressive-dogs/) found that dogs trained using punishment and aversive training methods were twice as likely to be aggressive towards strangers and three times as likely to be aggressive towards family members.
1.4.2.2. Pro: This makes dominance training not only a worse method, but one that should perhaps be outlawed as dangerous.
1.5. Pro: Positive Reinforcement training is more successful.
1.5.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.companionanimalpsychology.com/2012/07/positive-reinforcement-and-dog-training_11.html) among dog owners showed that reward-based training resulted in more obedient dogs with fewer problem behaviors.
1.5.2. Pro: People who only use positive reinforcement [report](https://www.companionanimalpsychology.com/2012/07/positive-reinforcement-and-dog-training_18.html) their dogs are less attention-seeking, aggressive or fearful.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.5.4. Pro: [Guide Dogs for the Blind](https://www.guidedogs.com/meet-gdb/dog-programs/guide-dog-training) uses PR to train its dogs.
1.5.4.1. Pro: USA guide dogs organization [reported](https://thehappypuppysite.com/the-evidence-for-positive-reinforcement-training-in-dogs/) an increase in pass rate from 50% \(the old rate\) to 80% in their dogs after switching to modern methods in 2005 in addition to a significant decrease in handler training time.
