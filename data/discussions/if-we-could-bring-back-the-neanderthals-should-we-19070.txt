Discussion Title: If we could bring back the Neanderthals, should we?

1. If made possible, we should bring back the Neanderthals.
1.1. Con: Human cloning is morally wrong.
1.1.1. Pro: Neanderthals were capable of interbreeding with homo sapiens to some extent. While we cannot be sure about their intelligence there is a large chance they are comparable to humans or at least intelligent enough to have 'personhood'. Thus the ethics of cloning would be the same as for homo sapiens humans.
1.1.2. Con: Cloning humans should never be on the cards. Man's ego would be too big and dangerous
1.2. Pro: Modern humans could learn a lot about ourselves by observing them.
1.2.1. Pro: Currently, modern humans [do not know](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/weekinreview/23wade.html) if Neanderthals could speak. A live one could answer this question, among others.
1.3. Pro: Homo Sapiens [killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal_extinction#Possible_cause_of_extinction) Neanderthals to extinction, so bringing them back is something we should feel obligated to do.
1.3.1. Con: It is likely that this wasn't a one-sided affair and that they too were trying to get rid of us.
1.4. Con: We will be bringing them into an environment totally different from the one they lived in and we don't know if they could adapt.
1.4.1. Pro: Neanderthals would have no immunity against the diseases we spread since their immune system didn't adapt to the bacteria, fungi and viruses of our society.
1.5. Pro: Crossbreeding could be beneficial to both species.
1.5.1. Con: Neanderthals were able survive in harsh environments. These traits aren't needed in modern times.
1.5.1.1. Con: Those traits could be extremely beneficial for future generations of astronauts.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Surviving Earth's harsh climates does not equate the environments in space.
1.5.2. Con: [Interbreeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal_extinction) might have caused the extinction of Neanderthals.
1.5.3. Con: it might also be harmful
1.6. Pro: The research acquired will be extremely beneficial for human medicine.
1.6.1. Pro: We may be able to trace the origins of human disease.
1.7. Con: Neanderthals were less intelligent than modern humans.
1.7.1. Pro: but then again, they had bigger brains than we have, maybe they were smarter than us in which case we'd be introducing a superior species which might threaten our own existence
1.7.1.1. Con: we would outnumber them million to one and they would only receive education provided by us, so it would take them generations to become an actual threat.
