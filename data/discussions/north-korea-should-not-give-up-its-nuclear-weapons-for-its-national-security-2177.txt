Discussion Title: North Korea should not give up its nuclear weapons for its national security.

1. North Korea should not give up its nuclear weapons for its national security.
1.1. Pro: Having nuclear weapons can be a good diplomatic tool for North Korea to make bargains with big countries.
1.1.1. Con: Other countries might see through the bargaining strategies and will not be fooled again.
1.1.1.1. Pro: In South Korea and the US, there have been strong voice that we should not make a compromise with North Korea which Pyeongyang fianlly wants.
1.1.2. Pro: Brad Glosserman, the executive director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in the US, argued, ["if North Korea didn’t get international assistance including food then its people would starve so it needed to be “public enemy number two”, inspiring just enough fear to keep other countries at bay but not enough for them to attack."](http://www.news.com.au/technology/why-its-so-important-for-north-korea-to-develop-nuclear-weapons/news-story/ae936c8099fdcfb137860260afcee844)
1.1.3. Pro: ["Historically, nuclear weapons have been used to either threaten or to deter enemies. However, it seems that North Korea had another goal in mind: using the weapon as a bargaining chip to bring the United States to the negotiation table."](https://www.northkoreanreview.net/single-post/2016/1/13/Does-North-Korea-have-a-Nuclear-Bargaining-Chip)
1.1.4. Pro: Shane Smith [analyzed](http://uskoreainstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NKNF_Evolving-Nuclear-Strategy_Smith.pdf) North Korean nuclear strategies in terms not only of military and war-fighting strategy, but also of political and diplomatic tools.
1.1.5. Pro: North Korea can use the card of its nuclear weapons[to get materials including food and energy from the international community.](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/why-would-north-korea-give-up-its-nuclear-weapons-20160110-gm2za5.html)
1.2. Con: There will be many advantages for its national security when North Korea gives up its nukes.
1.2.1. Pro: North Korea can get enormous economic and technological help from the international community to develop its economy, which is beneficial for stablizing its regime.
1.2.1.1. Con: Since Kim, Jong-un can fully control his people, the most important thing to maintain his power is not the normal people's lives, but the elite's. In this sense, developing its economy is not the priority.
1.2.1.2. Con: As people become richer and wealthier owing to the economic development, they might open their eyes for political liberty. South Korean case in the 1970s and 80s is a good example.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Kim, Jong-un can utilize the economic development as a tool to get more supports from his people. Just as Deng and his successors did in China, it will be more sustainable and stronger to maintain his power and national security in this sense, if Kim can make the economic development.
1.2.2. Con: Diplomatic and economic advantages can always be revoked.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization
\(KEDO\) was [not initiated on time and later revoked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Peninsula_Energy_Development_Organization) when the Agreed Framework was broken down.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Depending upon the regime in the US and South Korea, the position on the diplomatic and economic advantages can be changed.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: There are huge difference of positions towards North Korea between Bush and Obama administration in the US.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: The difference can be also found between Roh and Moon governments on the one hand, and Lee and Park governments on the other hand.
1.2.2.2.3. Pro: When North Korea participated in the six-party talks and denuclearlized its facitlity at Yongbyun, its name on the terrorist countries was lifted by the US. Soon after, however, Pyeongyang was re-designated as one of terrorist countries.
1.2.3. Pro: Normalizing the diplomatic relationship between North Korea and the US can be more beneficial for North Korean national security.
1.2.3.1. Con: Even if the US had formal relationships with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, Washington initiated wars and eliminated the leaders in the name of the war on terrors.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Establishing one's embassy in the other country can increase the number of contacts between two countries, which might be helpful to understand and cooperate better.
1.2.4. Pro: North Korea's nuclear program risks [exacerbating an arms race](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2017/03/08/hey-north-korea-youre-starting-an-arms-race/#56d370a229ac) in the region.
1.2.5. Con: The absence of an absolute deterrent is a great disadvantage that other factors can hardly compensate for.
1.3. Con: It is not nuclear weapons but traditional forces that deter the US from operating surgical strike on North Korea.
1.3.1. Pro: Since thousands of canons aim at Seoul, the US cannot choose the military option.
1.3.2. Pro: Another reason is the US military base at Uijeongbu. Located between Seoul and North Korea, the army base plays a role in tripwire. Once the battle occurs, the US army must be attacked which leads to automatic military intervention of the US military regardless of the US Congress permission.
1.3.3. Con: The US has the capability to totally destroy the canons nearby DMZ and to operate surgical strike on the nuclear facilities in North Korea at the same time.
1.3.4. Pro: One of main reasons to give up that option is because of North Korean armies nearby the demilitarized zone \(DMZ\).
1.3.5. Con: From the US perspective, the costs are hugely different between North Korean traditional military weapons and nuclear weapons. The former might give a lot of damage on South Korean assets. The latter, however, with fully-fledged missiles, can strike the US continent with enormous damage.
1.3.6. Con: The lack of information about where North Korean nuclear weapons are prevents the US from striking. If the US cannot assess that it will strike and destroy DPRK nuclear weapons with absolute certainty, it runs the risk of nuclear retaliation.
1.4. Con: It is naive to think that the North Korean nuclear problem magically stops in Seoul or Tokyo. North Korea is well-known to have collaborated with terrorism-sponsoring states such as Syria \(nuclear reactor attacked and destroyed in 2007 by the Israelis\), Iran, and Pakistan \(+China, Russia?\) They must not be allowed to master this technology and give it to other volatile or anti-Western regimes.
1.5. Pro: Nuclear weapons looks like the only way that North Korea can safeguard its sovereignty, at least under juche regime. At the same time it leads the country to an stalemate hard to get out
1.5.1. Con: Since 1952 the United States has not invaded North Korea, therefore North Korea cannot justify a requirement for nuclear weapons to protect itself.  The fact that North Korea could destroy Seoul with conventional artillery is enough of a deterrent.
1.6. Con: North Korea will never get a peace treaty if it remains a nuclear power. No nation will trust the Kim Regime and want it to benefit from decades of dishonesty and bad faith.
1.7. Pro: Making a compromise with the United States and South Korea is not reliable.
1.7.1. Pro: ["By 2002, the United States believed North Korea was pursuing both uranium enrichment technology and plutonium reprocessing technologies in defiance of the Agreed Framework. North Korea reportedly told American diplomats in private that they were in possession of nuclear weapons, citing American failures to uphold their own end of the "Agreed Framework" as a motivating force."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#Overview)
1.7.2. Con: ["Eventually it became clear that North Korea in the late 1990s was pursuing a clandestine program to enrich uranium for use in nuclear weapons in violation of the Agreed Framework. In October 2002, when an official U.S. delegation confronted the senior North Korean negotiator with this information during talks in Pyongyang, the negotiator admitted that North Korea was pursuing an enrichment program and other unspecified programs."](https://www.armscontrol.org/print/6605)
1.7.3. Con: ["North Korean officials changed their story again in 2010, when they revealed to visiting U.S. nuclear expert Siegfried Hecker that they had an enrichment facility at Yongbyon with 2,000 spinning centrifuges. Hecker was permitted to visit this facility and was impressed with its sophistication."](https://www.armscontrol.org/print/6605)
1.7.4. Con: In 2008, ["six-party discussions on verification, disablement, and energy assistance in Beijing end in stalemate due to a failure to reach agreement on verification. U.S. officials later claim that North Korea refused to agree in writing what it agreed verbally in Octobor."](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron#2002)
1.8. Con: Its constant nuclear threats against the US are North Korea's greatest threat to its national security. The US has been content to not invade the DPRK for almost half a century without their possession of nuclear weapons, but now that they posses nukes, the US may be forced to invade to defend itself from a nation which is constantly threatening a nuclear strike and may distribute material and/or weapons to terrorist organizations.
1.9. Con: International sanctions because of the possession of nuclear weapons might be harmful for North Korean national security.
1.9.1. Pro: Constant sanctions targeting the leadership group might weaken the sense of loyalty of the elite towards Kim, Jong-un.
1.9.2. Pro: International sanctions might have a bad impact on North Korean economy.
1.9.2.1. Con: Despite sanctions, [free markets i](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/5/2/15502672/north-korea-economy)mplicitly admitted by the North Korean government made the North Korean economy better.
1.9.2.2. Con: The bad economy in North Korea is [not due to the sanctions](https://www.ft.com/content/9427a7bc-24e1-11e7-8691-d5f7e0cd0a16?mhq5j=e2). It was mainly [because of the flood in the 1990s and the limited trade partners since the collapse of the Soviet Union](http://www.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/COE/Japanese/Newsletter/No.6.english/KIMURA.html).
1.9.2.3. Pro: [Several people working in human rights NGOs](https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/how-will-sanctions-on-north-korea-affect-its-people/3277042.html) argue that international sanctions inevitably cause hardships for North Korean people in general as well as their government.
1.9.2.3.1. Pro: [People who work in the coal and mining industries can suffer](https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/how-will-sanctions-on-north-korea-affect-its-people/3277042.html)from the international sanctions.
1.9.2.4. Con: International sanctions can make North Korea more rely on its people living abroad, so that the effect of sanctions could be minimized.
1.9.2.4.1. Pro: Lots of bank accounts are made in Southeast Asia and Middle East where the UN has little power to take control.
1.9.2.4.2. Pro: North Korean people can get to Malaysia without visa.
1.9.3. Con: [International sanctions against North Korea have not been effective due to arbitrary interpretations and weak implementation.](http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/25/news/north-korea-economy-sanctions/index.html) So it is not disadvantageous to have nuclear weapons.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Although current sanctions by the international community are the strongest ever, [China, accounting for more than 80% of North Korean trade, does not completely implement sanctions in terms of oil or other strategic resources.](http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/24/news/economy/north-korea-china-pressure-trump/index.html)
1.9.4. Con: ["Beijing has apparently made the calculation that a nuclear-armed North, however undesirable, is a better option than regime collapse."](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/why-would-north-korea-give-up-its-nuclear-weapons-20160110-gm2za5.html)In this sense, sanctions will not be implemented to the extreme degree that North Korea gets damaged a lot.
1.10. Pro: North Korea has been intimidated by other countries to be attacked with nuclear weapons.
1.10.1. Con: During the Korean war, it was one of military options for the US and its allies to win the war. After the war, the US mentioned the deployment and usage of nuclear weapons in the context of defending South Korea. This is because it was North Korea which initiated the war.
1.10.2. Con: After the Cold War, the US retreated tactical nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea. Therefore, there has been no nuclear weapons in South Korea. Despite this, North Korea has been developing nuclear weapons.
1.10.2.1. Con: Even if there is no nuclear weapons in the soil of the southern peninsula, the US still has the largest number of nuclear weapons which can be launched anywhere in the world with its advanced missiles. Therefore, from the North Korean perspective, the threat from the US still exists.
1.10.3. Con: In the interview with the columnist Robert Novak in early June 1975, the South Korean president Park Jeong-hee said “If the US nuclear umbrella were to be removed, we have to start developing our nuclear capability to save ourselves.”  \([Oberdorfer, p71](https://www.amazon.com/Two-Koreas-Contemporary-History/dp/0465031234)\) But the South Korean position was defensive, not with the intention of attacking North Korea.
1.10.4. Pro: In 2013, Korean Central News Agency said in its commentary, ["The DPRK's underground nuclear test was an unavoidable just option to protect the sovereignty and dignity of the country and nation from the ceaseless nuclear threats of the U.S. technically at war with it."](http://www.kcna.kp/kcna.user.article.retrieveNewsViewInfoList.kcmsf#this)
1.10.5. Pro: North Korea [argues](http://www.kcna.kp/kcna.user.article.retrieveNewsViewInfoList.kcmsf#this) that the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises are nuclear war drills targeting at North Korea.
1.10.5.1. Con: According to the description on these military exercises from the US and South Korea, "[the primary purpose of Foal Eagle is to demonstrate South Korean-U.S. military resolve to deter war on the Korean peninsula and to improve the combined and joint operational posture of those forces.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foal_Eagle)"
1.10.6. Pro: The United States president Truman initially mentioned the possibility of using nuclear weapons during[the Press conference on November 30th of 1950](https://trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=985).
1.10.6.1. Pro: Kim Il-sung was “enormously threatened” by the Truman’s remark on November 30, according to the testimony of Yoo Sung-cheol, the previous director of operations in the North Korean People’s Army. \([Hankook Ilbo, My translation](http://www.kyobobook.co.kr/product/detailViewKor.laf?mallGb=KOR&ejkGb=KOR&barcode=2007701000825)\)
1.10.6.2. Pro: In the Kim’s report to the 3rd regular conference of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea on December 12th of 1950, Kim, Il-sung said, “the US burglars are about to pose the brutal threat to use the atomic bombs because their invading army is on the brink of ruin.” \([Kim et el, p99](http://www.krpia.co.kr/search/product?keyword=%EB%B6%81%ED%95%9C%EC%97%B0%EA%B5%AC%EC%9E%90%EB%A3%8C%EC%A7%91&log=y), My translation\)
1.10.7. Pro: General MacArthur “submitted a list of ‘retaliation targets’ in China and North Korea, requiring twenty-six atomic bombs in all” on December 24th of 1950. \([Hastings, p183](http://sydney.edu.au/arts/government_international_relations/staff/profiles/justin.hastings.php)\)
1.10.8. Pro: In 1951, Johns Hopkins University research team advised “twenty-two types of tactical targets that can be attacked effectively with atomic warheads” to General MacArthur \([Rumbaugh et al, p2](http://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-special-reports/tactical-employment-of-atomic-weapons/)\)
1.10.8.1. Pro: On the extension of this, Operation Hudson Harbor was planned to “establish the capability to use atomic weapons on the battlefield with an atomic strike, including weapons assembly and testing, leading, ground control of bomb aiming” \([Cummings, p61](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30209238?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\)
1.10.9. Pro: Eisenhower considered atomic bombs not only as a tool to threaten but also a possible option that can be used in the battlefield. \([Betts, p38](https://www.brookings.edu/book/nuclear-blackmail-and-nuclear-balance/)\)
1.10.10. Pro: One year after the armistice treaty of 1953, Secretary of State John Dulles announced that [“the US will protect its allies through the ‘deterrent of massive retaliatory power.’”](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/dulles-announces-policy-of-massive-retaliation)
1.10.11. Pro: In 1955, Eisenhower [“declared at a news conference that in the event of war in East Asia, he would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons against military targets "exactly as you would use a bullet."](https://millercenter.org/president/eisenhower/foreign-affairs)
1.10.12. Pro: In 1958 at the latest, the US deployed tactical nuclear weapons in the southern part of the Korean peninsula.
1.11. Pro: Nuclear weapons can give North Korea deterrence effects.
1.11.1. Pro: Some people argue that making a compromise is not the goal of having nuclear weapons. [Regime survival and deterrence effects](https://www.brookings.edu/research/dealing-with-a-nuclear-armed-north-korea/) are two main purposes for North Korea.
1.11.2. Pro: [During the last Gulf War in 2003, Kim Jong-un's father and predecessor as leader disappeared from public view for 44 days. It was surmised at the time that Kim Jong-il feared assassination by Tomahawk missile. If Kim Jong-un has his own finger on the nuclear button, that calculation changes. His fear that the United States or South Korea might kill him suddenly is diminished.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37321686)
1.11.3. Con: In order to have deterrence effects from nuclear weapons, the country has to have the second-strike capability. It means that the country attacked by a nuclear weapon can retaliate the attacking country with the same weapon. In case of North Korea, owing to the small size of territory, it is difficult to have second-strike capability.
1.11.3.1. Con: For small-size countries, submarines are more essential to have second-strike capability. Since they are moving all the times and hard to detect, they can give North Korea second-strike capability.
1.11.3.2. Con: The size of territory does not completely determine the second strike capability. Just as China, Russia, and India, North Korea [has been putting its efforts](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2017/02/24/0200000000AEN20170224000251315.html) to develop moving missiles which can be used for the second strike.
1.12. Con: Instead of nuclear weapons, other non-conventional weapons can be used for the national security.
1.12.1. Con: For a relatively small and poor country, nuclear weapons are the most economically viable way to ensure security.
1.12.2. Pro: The U.S. Secretary of Defense’s [2014 report](https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/North_Korea_Military_Power_Report_2013-2014.pdf) indicated that the DPRK possesses a potentially robust biological warfare capability.
1.12.3. Pro: ["North Korea probably could employ chemical weapon agents by modifying a variety of conventional munitions, including artillery and ballistic missiles.](https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/Military_and_Security_Developments_Involving_the_Democratic_Peoples_Republic_of_Korea_2015.PDF)"
1.12.4. Con: Unlike other WMD, [nuclear weapons have deterrence effects.](https://www.aps.org/units/fps/newsletters/2007/october/foster-payne.html) Therefore, other weapons are not sufficient to secure North Korean security.
1.13. Pro: North Korea does not have superiority against South Korea in terms of economic and traditional military power, which leads to the necessity of having nuclear weapons.
1.13.1. Con: Inferior position of North Korea against South Korea in terms of economy and traditional military does not necessarily lead to the necessity of having nukes. Pyeongyang can develop other non-conventional weapons.
1.13.2. Pro: Brad Glosserman, the executive director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in the US, said, [“Nuclear weapons capability is the only thing that distinguishes North Korea from South Korea, and the inter-Korean competition is profound. This is the only one in which North Korea is on top, so they’ve got to keep those weapons.”](http://www.news.com.au/technology/why-its-so-important-for-north-korea-to-develop-nuclear-weapons/news-story/ae936c8099fdcfb137860260afcee844)
1.13.3. Pro: As of 1975, South Korea overtook North Korea in terms of per capita GDP in the following [figure](http://signsofchaos.blogspot.fr/2013/05/generating-wealth-of-nations-4-real-gdp.html).
1.13.3.1. Pro: As of 2013, South Korean GDP is about [40 times bigger](https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2013/apr/08/south-korea-v-north-korea-compared) than that of North Korea.
1.13.4. Pro: In terms of military expenditure, South Korea exceeded North Korea in the mid-1970s, and in the late 1970s, the amount of military budget in South Korea was almost twice larger than that of North Korea as we can see from the [graph](https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/HELIX.HTM#*).
1.13.5. Con: In terms of the size of [active-duty troops, artillery pieces, and submarines](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/04/11/how-north-and-south-koreas-armed-forces-compare-infographic/#a2fdf3b828b4), North Korea enjoys superiority over South Korea.
1.13.6. Pro: In terms of [main battle tanks, combat aircrafts, helicopters and frigates/destroyers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/04/11/how-north-and-south-koreas-armed-forces-compare-infographic/#a2fdf3b828b4), South Korea is stronger than North Korea.
1.14. Pro: Countries which gave up nuclear weapons ended up tragic results.
1.14.1. Pro: After Pyongyang's last nuclear test in January of 2016, a commentary in North Korea's media said: ["History proves that powerful nuclear deterrence serves as the strongest treasured sword for frustrating outsiders' aggression...The Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq and the Gaddafi regime in Libya could not escape the fate of destruction after being deprived of their foundations for nuclear development and giving up nuclear programmes of their own accord."](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37321686)
1.14.2. Con: ["South Africa produced six nuclear weapons in the 1980s, but dismantled them in the early 1990s."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons#cite_note-10) Despite its abandonment, South Africa has not collapsed or fallen into any security crisis.
1.14.3. Pro: ["Ukraine inherited about 5,000 nuclear weapons when it became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991, making its nuclear arsenal the third-largest in the world. By 1996, Ukraine had agreed to dispose of all nuclear weapons within its territory, with the condition that its borders were respected, as part of the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons#cite_note-10) Owing to diplomatic stance of Ukraine towards the European Union \(EU\) and Russia, Russia began  annexation of Crimea in 2014.
1.14.4. Pro: The collapse of Soviet Union made Belarus possess nuclear weapons made by the USSR. But Belarus agreed to transfer all the nuclear weapons to Russia. [The US pledged to give financial supports to Belarus in exchange for returning the Highly Enriched Uranium \(HEU\) to Russia. But the US imposed sanctions against Belarus because of Belarus' violent policies against political opponents. Belarus stopped returning HEU.](http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/belarus/)
1.14.5. Con: Like Belarus, Kazakhstan also inherited nuclear weapons following the collapse of the Soviet Union. ["In its first decade of independence, Kazakhstan dismantled and destroyed Soviet weapons systems and facilities left on its territory, and signed major international nonproliferation treaties."](http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/kazakhstan/) There has been no serious security threats even after giving up nuclear weapons.
1.15. Pro: Nuclear weapons can be a tool to unify the peninsula which can be regarded as a preemptive way to secure its national security.
1.15.1. Pro: Although the tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea were retreated by the US, North Korea needs nuclear weapons in case of war against the South Korea. The US will participate in the war and might intimidate North Korea with nuclear weapons just as during the Korean War.
1.15.2. Pro: In the 1970s, some North Korean officials [thought](http://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/111471) that the peaceful unification would be impossible. Once the war would break out again, nuclear weapons were necessary this time.
1.15.3. Con: After the end of the Cold War, the diplomatic relationship between two Koreas has been better in general. Both countries do not explicitly proclaim the necessity of unification by force.
1.16. Pro: Nuclear weapons can stabilize the domestic political situation in North Korea.
1.16.1. Con: Concerning Twining’s statement, nuclear weapon is not the only way to integrate people and to allocate resources to its key groups after blackmailing the international society. Other totalitarian regimes including Libya could do without nuclear weapons.
1.16.2. Con: About Lankov’s explanation, giving up nuclear weapons does not necessarily mean that North Korea will give up fighting against its enemies. Although it would affect not the North Korean willingness but its ability, it does not make North Korea unable to attack.
1.16.3. Pro: Andrei Lankov mentions, “the sufferings and destitution of the last two decades were a necessary sacrifice to protect the country from outside enemies…surrender of nuclear weapons would…render these sufferings and deaths meaningless.” \([Moore, p166](https://www.amazon.com/dp/142141094X/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_dp_T1_YofrzbW6STHMC)\).
1.16.4. Pro: Daniel Twining says that nuclear weapons function as a tool to integrate people as well as to make key groups loyal to the regime by distributing resources from the international society \([Moore, p200](https://www.amazon.com/dp/142141094X/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_dp_T1_YofrzbW6STHMC)\).
1.16.5. Pro: Nuclear weapons [can play a role in](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/why-would-north-korea-give-up-its-nuclear-weapons-20160110-gm2za5.html) making hard-liners loyal to Kim, Jong-un and reassuring his population about protecting them from the US and its allies.
1.17. Pro: There is no perpetual ally in the international community.
1.17.1. Pro: After the Cold War, South Korea established relations with China and Russia, while North Korea failed to do so with the US and Japan.
1.17.2. Con: Although the cooperation and support was different, China has been one of the closest allies for North Korea since 1948.
1.17.3. Pro: Since the mid-1950s, Soviet Union and China began conflicting on the issue of whether the Communist could coexist with the Capitalist West. This political and ideological debates hugely impacted North Korea.
1.17.4. Pro: The fact that Soviet Union withdrew the nuclear weapons from Cuba impressed Kim that Moscow would not protect him, which led him to announce the four military guidelines at the fourth-term Party Central Committee on December 1962. \([Person](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/NKIDP_eDossier_12_North_Korea_and_the_Cuban_Missile_Crisis.pdf)\)
1.17.5. Pro: In the Chinese-North Korean summit on April 18 of 1975, Mao “declined to support Kim Il-sung’s proposal to attack the South.” \([Xia and Shen, p1108](https://academic.oup.com/dh/article-abstract/38/5/1083/516927/China-s-Last-Ally-Beijing-s-Policy-toward-North)\)
1.17.6. Con: North Korea and China have been keeping the Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation Friendship Treaty since 1961, where the article stipulates that ["the two nations guarantee to adopt immediately all necessary measures to oppose any country or coalition of countries that might attack either nation."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-North_Korean_Mutual_Aid_and_Cooperation_Friendship_Treaty)
