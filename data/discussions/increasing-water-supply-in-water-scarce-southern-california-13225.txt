Discussion Title: Increasing water supply in water-scarce Southern California

1. How can water supplies in Southern California be increased?
1.1. Recycle our wastewater.
1.1.1. Pro: Harvest a plentiful, unwanted resource: sewage and stormwater.
1.1.2. Con: It is expensive.
1.1.3. Con: Recycling sewerage is a good alternative, but storm water has oils and heavy metals from road surfaces that are difficult and costly to remove, compared to sewerage treatment.
1.2. Increase our supply of water.
1.2.1. Con: Industry will use up the extra water for profit.
1.2.2. Con: It is expensive to create pipelines.
1.2.2.1. Con: The potential negative repercussions are dangerous, and expensive to fix.
1.2.3. Pro: This would plan for the needs of a growing population.
1.2.4. Con: Extra water will used up, and not be conserved as the population grows.  More is needed.
1.3. Reduce usage.
1.3.1. Con: The shortage is extensive and needs focused work, not stopgap solutions.
1.3.2. Con: There is only so much that can be reduced.
1.3.3. Pro: Reduce-reuse-recycle: this is the most efficient manner of increasing supply.  No costs other than "getting the word out."
1.3.3.1. Pro: It is also a green choice, that helps for the better
1.3.3.1.1. Con: This solution relies on individual behaviors, instead of addressing the collective problem.
