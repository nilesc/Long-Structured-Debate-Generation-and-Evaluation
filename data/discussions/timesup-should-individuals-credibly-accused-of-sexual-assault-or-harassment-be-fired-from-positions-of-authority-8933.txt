Discussion Title: #timesup: Should individuals credibly accused of sexual assault or harassment be fired from positions of authority?

1. Individuals credibly accused of sexual assault or harassment should be fired from positions of authority.
1.1. Pro: People who commit sexual assault and hold positions of power propagate rape culture in an incredibly pernicious manner. Removing them is a step toward ending rape culture in the long term.
1.1.1. Pro: Rape culture is perpetuated by men treating women as sexual objects without agency.
1.1.1.1. Con: Objectification is not assault.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: While objectification alone does not qualify as assault, a culture that encourages the objectification of women reinforces the idea that they are there for men's pleasure, and creates unrealistic ideas about sex and relationships.
1.1.2. Con: Ending rape culture requires men to recognise their own problematic behaviour. Internal investigations and dismissals are closed processes that do not promote understanding of the causes of rape culture.
1.1.2.1. Con: While these investigations are closed proceedings, if enough companies highly publicize their zero-tolerance approach, this will shift the media narrative in a way that allows men to recognize the perniciousness of rape culture.
1.1.2.2. Pro: There is a growing belief that the current climate of accusations is becoming a '[witch hunt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/is-sexual-harassment-just-a-witch-hunt-now-thats-absurd-and-heres-why/2018/01/26/b7bd0220-02bd-11e8-9d31-d72cf78dbeee_story.html?utm_term=.84f525e80562)', a term which immediately undermines the credibility and shows how some are keen to avoid really examining their own behaviour at all costs.
1.1.3. Con: Credibly accused does not mean they actually committed acts of sexual assault and they are therefore not necessarily contributing to rape culture.
1.1.4. Con: There is no such thing as "rape culture".
1.1.4.1. Pro: Rape is illegal.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Despite rape being illegal, it continues to occur in high numbers. [1 in 6](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence) American women has been the victim of a completed or attempted rape during their lifetime.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The statistic quoted is now around 20 years old. \(1998\) so is not a reliable representation of the actual numbers of rapes committed.
1.1.4.1.1.2. Con: Lots of things are illegal and still happen in high quantities. Drugs, for example. It doesn't make that activity acceptable to the rest of society.
1.1.4.1.1.3. Pro: [Another study](https://rapecrisis.org.uk/statistics.php) indicates nearer to 1 in 5 women having been sexually assaulted since the age of sixteen.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: The illegality of an act doesn't affect the social structures associated with it.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Rape culture does not exist because rapists are ostracized from society and their actions seen as abhorrent.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: Despite rapists being despised, they very rarely face any consequences for their actions. It has been found that [97%](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system) of rapists never spend even one day in jail for their crimes.
1.1.4.2.1.1. Con: The cited report simply assumes the guilt of the accused, including huge numbers of hypothetical accused. That more rapes than robberies lead to an arrest is taken as evidence that there is bias against arrest, rather than evidence that many accusations are without foundation, even though either is plausible.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: Most rape reports are assumed false, and even those cases that enter the news often lament the [lost potential](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnn-feels-sorry-for-steubenville-rapists-world-cant-believe-its-ears) of the rapist rather than treat them as abhorrent.
1.1.4.2.3. Con: This is not universal. Many [minimise or ignore](https://www.fastcompany.com/3068610/the-real-reasons-women-dont-report-sexual-harassment) sexual harassment/assault, both male and female; this is an inescapable symptom of rape culture.
1.1.4.3. Con: Rape culture refers to a society where rape is common and often excused or at least normalized by the media. In these ways, the current societal environment could very much be viewed as contributing to rape culture.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.
1.1.4.4. Con: The argument against the existence of rape culture can only be a semantic one; we are currently learning that in Hollywood there has long existed a culture in which powerful figures use their influence to assert themselves sexually upon newcomers and those with less social/economic/industry capital. Like all subcultures, it is not monolithic, and does not align with the values of those outside the culture. But it exists all the same.
1.1.4.4.1. Con: These acts were not rape. They were in almost all cases consensual sex performed in exchange for a consideration: prostitution, in fact.
1.1.4.4.1.1. Con: Coerced sex is rape.
1.1.4.5. Pro: There is no rape culture as in a culture of rape that is common to most men. Most men do not think of rape as permissible or justifiable.
1.1.4.5.1. Con: [A recent study](https://www.salon.com/2015/01/15/the_ugly_truth_about_sexual_assault_more_men_admit_to_it_if_you_dont_call_it_rape/) found 1 in 3 men confess they’d be willing to force a woman to have sex with them if they knew they wouldn’t get caught.
1.1.4.5.1.1. Con: The study was conducted on less that 80 college students. This is hardly an accurate representation of society as a whole.
1.1.4.5.2. Con: This is true, but men equally do not always understand or acknowledge what constitutes rape. This includes elements like undermining or ignoring a victim's testimony based on what they were wearing, their other sexual behaviour, and their level of inebriation at the time of the assault.
1.1.5. Con: People who commit sexual assault and hold positions of power do propagate criminal culture and should be removed. But "people who commit sexual assault and hold positions of power" are in a nonidentical group to "individuals credibly accused of sexual assault and harassment".  Therein lies the logical error committed. Consequences mustn't follow accusations, they must follow determined guilt.
1.1.6. Pro: The average full time employee works for approximately 40 hours a week, which is almost 25% of the total week. This means that their workplace is often the institution they interact with the most on a day to day basis and so plays an important role in enforcing norms in their life. When sexual harassment of any kind is tolerated in the workplace, it entrenches the norm of harassment being acceptable.
1.1.6.1. Pro: When people see that sexual harassment is no longer tolerated in their workplace, it helps to change the norms of acceptability that people currently believe about sexual harassment.
1.1.7. Con: Suspending them from their roles is a better solution. This shows people in lower positions on the hierarchy the severity of the allegations, and also allows time for a criminal investigation to confirm that they actually did commit sexual assault.
1.1.8. Pro: The culture of organisations is shaped in a [top-down manner](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/cristina-m-regalado/follow-the-leader-shaping_b_8617808.html): the behaviour of those at the top normalises similar harassment at every level.
1.1.8.1. Pro: People in positions of power have an incentive not to fire lower down employees for similar behaviour so as not to set a precedent which could lead to themselves being fired.
1.1.8.1.1. Pro: Those in positions of power who behave in this manner are also less likely to view such behavior by lower-level employees as problematic in the first place.
1.1.8.2. Con: There are varying level of benefits and limitations that each member of an organization has. The individuals at the top receive much more monetary compensation for similar \(or reduced\) work hours, and any shortcomings in their behavior are treated with less severity than those of employees down the ladder. It only seems normal within that scenario that cases of harassment be treated differently.
1.1.8.2.1. Pro: A CEO or vice president of a company will not be treated with the same scrutiny for being late. The action which might have no consequences for a person high up on the ladder may result in someone below on the ladder being terminated from employment.
1.1.8.2.2. Pro: The [difference](http://fortune.com/2017/07/20/ceo-pay-ratio-2016/) in monetary compensation within the same company is astounding. The physical and mental exertion performed by workers on the lower tier may be much higher, but the monetary reward is much more reduced than someone high up on the ladder.
1.1.9. Pro: Organisations systemically cover-up harassment and assault allegations directed by a ['boys club' at the top](https://www.mediaite.com/online/who-is-cleaning-up-fox-news-legacy-of-systemic-sexism-a-slew-of-female-executives/). It is important to dismantle this.
1.2. Con: Automatically firing people accused of sexual assault or harassment would cause increased detriment to victims of a false rape accusation.
1.2.1. Pro: The frequency notwithstanding, being falsely accused of rape is hugely emotionally devastating, considerably more so than most other crimes. Indeed, false accusations - and the repercussions on people's [personal](http://www.rebelcircus.com/blog/mother-of-four-commits-suicide-after-a-false-accusation-that-shed-been-intimate-with-an-underage-boy-caused-her-to-lose-custody-of-her-children/) and [working](http://metro.co.uk/2017/10/14/police-officer-contemplated-suicide-after-a-woman-falsely-accused-him-of-rape-7000169/) lives - have led to a number of falsely accused individuals [committing suicide](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/446681/thomas-klocke-suicide-texas-university-student-commits-suicide-after-being-accused). It is an indisputably reasonable fear.
1.2.1.1. Con: The consequences of allowing the accused to remain in their position are even more severe. Weinstein and Nassar are prime examples, as they were able to abuse many more people as a result of not losing positions of power.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.
1.2.2. Pro: Ease of getting individuals fired from positions of authority could lead to those individuals who wish to fulfill personal or professional agendas misusing this power to make up false claims of assault or harassment.
1.2.3. Con: More harm is done by sheltering the accused than by trusting the accuser.
1.2.3.1. Con: On a case by case basis, by trusting the accuser you potentially create a victim of a crime \(a false rape accusation\) however by trusting the accused even if they are guilty you avoid creating another victim as the victim \(of rape\) has already been created.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: If the accusation is in fact true, it is entirely possible more victims will be created, as the person who initially committed the assault has not been removed from their position or punished, so may harass or assault others.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: It is impossible to compare the severity of both situations. To be raped and not have the guilty party convicted, or to be falsely accused of rape, are both life-altering miscarriages of justice. It is not about counting the number of victims, but rather about minimising the harm done to the innocent parties.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.2.3.1.2.2. Pro: False accusations are [no more common](https://theconversation.com/heres-the-truth-about-false-accusations-of-sexual-violence-88049) in sexual assault than any other crime and therefore this is not a reasonable fear.
1.2.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: In addition to this, rape is [dramatically under-reported](https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/cjji/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/04/Rapelitrev.pdf). A large prevalence study indicated that police-reported rape is as low as 6%, with around 40% of these citing the attitudes of police and court systems as the reason.
1.2.3.1.2.2.2. Con: Any amount of false accusations warrants a reasonable fear. Indeed, even if statistics showed only a tiny fraction of cases to be false accusations, these incidents should merit someone the right to be innocent until proven guilty.
1.2.3.1.2.2.3. Con: With other crimes, a due process of law is carried out to verify the authenticity of the statements. The [evidential burden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidential_burden) that needs to be met is fairly high and needs to be met before any punishment is given. With accusations, it is very hard to verify the authenticity of one's statement in part due to lack of [independent witnesses](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/25/rape-myths-low-conviction-rate).
1.2.3.1.2.2.4. Pro: There is a [pervasive culture](https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/cjji/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/04/Rapelitrev.pdf) within criminal justice systems - most specifically police forces - that anticipates high levels of false sexual assault allegations: a third of those interviewed \(very incorrectly\) estimated that around 25% of rape allegations are false. Studies have also unanimously found that the concern of false reports is at the forefront of police officers' minds at time of an initial report. This bias clouds how all victims are treated and how seriously they are taken.
1.2.3.1.2.2.4.1. Pro: Pre-existing biases amongst \(particularly male\) jury members mean they are [inclined to acquit](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320244912_Juries_in_Rape_Trials_Balanced_or_Biased) based on stereotypes about women who are sexually assaulted.
1.2.3.1.2.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.2.3.1.2.2.6. Pro: Academic studies have demonstrated that the rate of false reporting is low.
1.2.3.1.2.2.6.1. Pro: Credible academic studies have established that the rate of false reporting is [between 2 and 8%](https://www.vox.com/2015/6/1/8687479/lie-rape-statistics).
1.2.3.1.2.2.6.2. Pro: In a study of the Los Angeles Police Department, the rate of false accusations was found to be 4.5% [\(Spohn, p.49\)](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/237582.pdf).
1.2.3.1.2.2.6.3. Pro: A study of English false rape accusations found that the number was between 3% and 9%, although likely to be closer to the lower bound [\(Kelly, p.83\)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238713283_Home_Office_Research_Study_293_A_gap_or_a_chasm_Attrition_in_reported_rape_cases).
1.2.3.1.2.2.6.4. Pro: Across Europe, cases designated as false claims by the police range between 1% and 9% [\(Lovett, p.112\)](http://kunskapsbanken.nck.uu.se/nckkb/nck/publik/fil/visa/197/different).
1.2.3.1.2.3. Con: One cannot, as they are entirely different scenarios. But if we remove the specific charge of rape, and just look at the fundamental argument of the claim and it's ramifications, we find a legal question that has long been settled in the Western world. That question is "is it better to let a guilty man go free, or to convict an innocent man?". The answer, enshrined in the principle of innocent until proven guilty, is the former.
1.2.3.1.3. Con: The testimonies of the #metoo movement prove that to not be the case, as most of the accused have dozens of accusers or more.
1.2.3.2. Con: Not automatically ensuring someone is fired from their job is not sheltering the accused. It is giving the accused a fair and lawful chance to defend themselves.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Sheltering the accused and refusing to believe the accuser will lead to instances where abusers are able to go on harassing and assaulting people, causing significant harm to the victims.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: Sheltering the accuser and refusing to believe the accused will lead to instances where people who make false allegations are able to continue making these allegations, thus causing damage to a multitude of people.
1.2.3.4. Con: The harm to the accuser by performing an investigation is the same whether the investigation occurs before the accused is fired or before they are jailed, but the harm done to the accused if they are fired before an investigation exonerates them remains.
1.2.3.4.1. Con: Assuming the allegations are true, the harm to the accuser is substantially worse if they have to continue interacting with the accused in a professional environment and seeing them in public spaces, or even simply knowing that they may go on to commit the same crime again.
1.2.3.5. Pro: Forcing other employees to work with the accused contributes negatively to the company's culture and work environment.
1.2.3.5.1. Con: Firing an accused employee contributes negatively to the company's culture and work environment.
1.2.3.5.2. Con: Companies may have a [suspend with pay](https://www.gov.uk/disciplinary-procedures-and-action-at-work/suspension-from-work) policy to ensure the safety of both parties when accusations are made. They are not obligated to do so but it is to the benefit of the employee to make sure his income is not jeopardized based on accusations.
1.2.4. Pro: Being fired for such accusations would be a confirmation of guilt in the eyes of many and would irreparably damage a person's reputation.
1.2.5. Pro: Firing accused people without proof of guilt makes influential people blackmailable even if they committed no misconduct. It is much easier to fabricate a false accusation than it is to fabricate a guilty charge.
1.2.5.1. Con: The stigma and victim blaming which society [inflicts](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-ludy-green/breaking-down-the-present_b_8129858.html) on survivors of sexual assault who come forward with accusations makes this an unlikely scenario.
1.2.6. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.2.2.
1.3. Pro: Sexual assault and harassment dissuade women from entering the workplace or cause them to leave, harming the overall goal of gender equality in the workplace.
1.3.1. Pro: Women are [put off male-dominated industries](https://www.vox.com/2017/11/30/16706162/sexual-harassment-wage-gap-studies) in which sexual harassment is disproportionately high, [such as manufacturing](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/11/21/16685942/sexual-harassment-industry-service-retail).
1.3.1.1. Pro: Women in the tech industry, which leans disproportionately male, have [spoken](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html) out about the culture of sexual harassment in Silicon Valley and how it dissuades women from pursuing careers in tech.
1.3.2. Pro: Hostile workplaces, in part created by sexual harassment, [push women into lower-paying jobs](http://www.epi.org/publication/womens-work-and-the-gender-pay-gap-how-discrimination-societal-norms-and-other-forces-affect-womens-occupational-choices-and-their-pay/).
1.3.3. Con: This argument paints women as weak creatures that can't stand up for themselves.
1.3.3.1. Con: Demanding women not be assaulted or harrassed at work is not asking for special privileges.
1.3.3.2. Pro: French film star Catherine Deneuve has [denounced](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/10/europe/catherine-deneuve-france-letter-metoo-intl/index.html) the the #MeToo movement for this reason, claiming that it helps the "enemies of sexual freedom."
1.3.3.2.1. Con: Deneuve has also been vocal in her [support](https://www.20minutes.fr/people/2032899-20170317-affaire-roman-polanski-catherine-deneuve-defend-realisateur-provoque-tolle) of Roman Polanski, rendering her critique of the movement problematic.
1.3.4. Con: This assumes that a company has an overall goal of gender equality in the workplace.
1.3.4.1. Con: Companies should be invested in having a diverse range of staff, and this requires a safe and inviting work environment, which includes one where people are protected from harassment and assault.
1.3.4.2. Con: Diversity within the workplace is in a company's interests because it correlates with better financial results [\(Hunt, p.1\)](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/organization/our%20insights/why%20diversity%20matters/diversity%20matters.ashx).
1.3.5. Con: Gender equality is not a good enough reason to suggest people should lose their jobs withough a fair chance to defend themselves.
1.3.5.1. Con: Perhaps this is the price of equality: a transitional period wherein men suffer some unfair treatment, before society reaches some form of equilibrium.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: This assumes only men are falsely accused of rape.
1.3.5.1.2. Con: This assumes only men are negatively effected by a man's job loss: their families, work colleagues and friendships will be affected.
1.4. Pro: Society often fails individuals with credible claims of sexual assault and harassment in terms of both social and legal repercussions. A system where the credibly accused pay for their actions by having their employment terminated ensures that the accused faces consequences.
1.4.1. Pro: The entertainment industry has repeatedly failed to act in response to allegations.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Woody Allen continued to enjoy a successful career and had many celebrities come out and support him despite allegations against him of [harassment and molestation](https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/11/16635446/woody-allen-dylan-farrow-mia-ronan-sexual-assault-allegation-metoo). Being a well connected and renowned star, he was able to dodge his allegations and continue working as an actor and director, even insofar as including themes of relationship between an older man and a much younger woman in many of his movies.
1.4.1.2. Pro: The Nate Parker and Jean Celestin [rape controversy](http://people.com/movies/a-complete-timeline-of-the-nate-parker-rape-allegations-and-the-production-of-birth-of-a-nation/) resulted in both accused getting off scot-free despite vocal criticism on them from the side of the accuser. While the accuser ended up committing suicide, both accused ending up attaining financial success and fame.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Roman Polanski achieved widespread fame and success as a film maker despite having [numerous](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/17/16156902/roman-polanski-child-rape-charges-explained-samantha-geimer-robin-m) sexual assault allegations against him, both of children and adults. He ended up not having to face any consequences for his actions as he fled the states and continued to enjoy his film-making carrier in other countries.
1.4.1.4. Pro: In the case of the entertainment industry - wherein the nature of the industry means that most employees are freelance or temporary - it is difficult, if not impossible, for individual allegations to have effect in a business framework. Part of the 'power' of abusers in the industry is that they are those in charge of employment on individual projects, and/or can blacklist individuals. Legally pursuing dismissal or discrimination is nigh on impossible.
1.4.1.5. Con: It may have been a long time coming, but in the light of #metoo and #timesup, the entertainment industry has been seen to make positive strides in the right direction. Firing Weinstein and other senior figures demonstrates that the industry is committed to, and is, changing.
1.4.1.6. Pro: Major spokespeople in the industry have [confirmed](http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/17/media/scott-rosenberg-harvey-weinstein/index.html) that "everyone knew" of Harvey Weinstein's pattern of sexual abuse for years prior to the New York Times breaking the story.
1.4.2. Con: While being professionally terminated is a consequence that the accused will suffer, it is difficult to establish that is a severe enough consequence. The [effects](https://www.rainn.org/effects-sexual-violence) of sexual assault and harassment are arguably much more severe since the accused might still find employment elsewhere, but the victim might never psychologically recover.
1.4.2.1. Con: While being fired might not be a severe enough consequence, it is still better than no consequence at all.
1.4.2.2. Con: The support of the company they work for may make an employee feel more confident in bringing the case forward legally by reporting it to the police or bringing forward a civil suit against the perpetrator.
1.4.3. Con: This system would also lead to people who were innocent, yet credibly accused, being punished for crimes they have not committed. This is unjust.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Companies might weigh the legal risk and feel that there is a [greater danger](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/sexual-misconduct/accusations-metoo-era-how-companies-handle-complaints-n829326) in keeping an employee in office after an accusation, even if the evidence against them isn't crystal clear. They would want to separate the accused from the company as soon as possible because the legal risk of mishandling a situation in which a woman has complained of sexual harassment is huge.
1.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.2.2.
1.4.3.3. Pro: This is evidenced in the \(multiple\) cases of UK university students being accused of rape, and later having charges dropped. In three key cases - [Liam Allen](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/liam-allen-student-falsely-accused-of-rape-police-cherry-picked-evidence-a3753781.html), [Isaac Itiary](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/dec/22/liam-allan-and-isaac-itiary-trial-collapses-should-lead-to-much-needed-reform) and [Oliver Mears](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/18/oxford-university-student-cleared-rape-charge-yet-another-case/) - they were compelled to drop out of university. This is indicative of major flaws in how the justice system handles sexual harassment.
1.4.3.4. Pro: The true extent of false allegations of rape is very difficult to determine. However, it is notable that sites like [accused.me.uk](https://accused.me.uk/) exist as a hub for those whose lives have been destroyed by false accusations.
1.4.4. Con: Every act of assault or harassment is of varying degrees; having one objective punishment across the board of professional dismissal is not a proper criteria for justice.
1.4.4.1. Con: If criminal or civil proceedings are brought, then the sentence can be varied by a judge depending on the severity of the harassment/assault. This is different to whether an employer considers someone a suitable employee.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: In the proposed scenario the employer acts as the judge. There are other ways to discipline employees, from a demotion or suspension to firing the employee.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: Destroying somebody's livelihood is a dramatic step, and one that should be taken lightly. Employers should be subservient to the law, not trying to exact it themselves.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Most crimes have different yardsticks for the punishment that they warrant. The act of killing a person, for example, varies between different countries and has a range of 'degrees' - from manslaughter to first-degree premeditated murder - insofar as severity of action and punishment. Certainly, there is no universal objective standard, and nor can there be for sexual assault.
1.4.4.3. Con: All instances of sexual assault and harassment, no matter the severity, are symptomatic of rape culture and should not be tolerated no matter what.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: Even 'low-level' sexual harassment can have [serious negative consequences](http://time.com/5017072/sexual-harassment-psychological-damage/) for women. A zero tolerance approach is the only way to root out the problem.
1.4.4.3.1.1. Con: Having everyone who commits 'low level' sexual abuse, mentioned in the parents research, fired is irrational, and would result in huge amounts of people both men and women being fired for offenses such as calling someone a slut.
1.4.4.3.2. Con: It is not a case of 'tolerating' sexual assault or harassment; rather, taking affirmative action without recourse to legal proceedings is a dangerous precedent to set. A company can refuse to tolerate sexual harassment and not fire those accused: the two are not mutually exclusive.
1.4.4.4. Pro: The definitions of sexual assault and harassment are too broad. The fact that this spectrum includes rape and touching a thigh should immediately demonstrate to us that it's not a good moral standard.
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: The effect of this will be to eliminate all sexual expression in the workplace, an infantilization of our culture that no one benefits from.
1.4.5. Pro: The justice system is seen to fail victims in a variety of cases and contexts. In the US, cases like that of [Brock Turner](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-02/brock-turner-justice-system-sexual-assault-victims/7801784) exemplify the serious flaws in how rape and sexual harassment are treated. As such, ensuring that there are reasonable consequences outside of the justice system is vital.
1.4.5.1. Pro: [Internationally](https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/cjji/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/04/Rapelitrev.pdf), whilst levels of reported rape continue to climb, the rates of conviction remain steadfastly low. There are clear, known failings in every aspect of the legal system as it pertains to rape and sexual assault.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: Roger Ailes, who faced credible accusations of sexual assault and harassment from more than [20 women](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roger-ailes-accusers-list_us_57a9fa19e4b06e52746db865), was never charged with anything.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: Bill Cosby, who faced credible accusations of sexual harassment and rape from more than [50 women](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/13/showbiz/gallery/cosby-accusers/index.html), was [not convicted](http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/bill-cosby-trial-complete-timeline-happened-2004/story?id=47799458) after a trial for sexual assault.
1.4.5.2. Con: Prosecution bias amongst the police favours the victim, leading to [inadequate disclosure of evidence](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42417553) to the alleged perpetrator \([Kozinksi, xiii](https://georgetownlawjournal.org/assets/kozinski-arcp-preface-9a990f08f3f006558eaa03ccc440d3078f5899b3426ec47aaedb89c606caeae7.pdf)\).
1.4.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.2.2.4.
1.4.5.3. Pro: Sexual assault cases often have very little evidence to corroborate the victim's account, and it is therefore extremely hard to meet the high standard of proof in criminal cases. It is necessary to have a system with a lower standard to protect victims.
1.4.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.2.2.4.
1.4.5.5. Con: Failures within the justice system undoubtedly occur, and must be addressed and corrected. This fact, however, does not change the right to due process. Failures of the justice system are a separate issue and do not justify lowering the standard of proof of claim.
1.4.5.5.1. Pro: An example to illustrate the point: If one believes that a guilty person was tried and acquitted, one cannot seek extralegal retribution.
1.4.5.5.2. Pro: We do not get to impose punishment because we are unsatisfied with the workings of the justice system. That is vigilantism. We must focus our energies on reforming the systems that fail us.
1.4.5.5.3. Con: When consistently let down by the systems that are supposed to protect us, there are no options remaining but to attack the problem from a different angle. As and when the failures in the justice system are suitably addressed, this will be rendered unnecessary; that could be a long ways off yet.
1.4.5.6. Con: Seeking extralegal enforcement of crimes because the justice system is flawed is a breakdown of the rule of law.
1.4.5.6.1. Con: The company is responsible for shaping their corporate culture to a higher standard than the law is.
1.4.5.6.1.1. Pro: Companies are allowed to create policies pertaining to what is acceptable or unacceptable behaviour in their workplace, and fire employees who exhibit unacceptable behaviour. This is not outside the rule of law because, so long as it is not discriminatory, it is not subject to the rule of law.
1.4.5.6.1.2. Con: It is not reasonable to place the burden of responsibility on companies; the law exists to create the processes and protection - for both victims and perpetrators - without individual companies trying to take this on.
1.4.5.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.5.2.
1.4.5.7. Pro: The lives of women who've been abused are changed profoundly \(lost careers, self-worth, living in fear/anxiety, addiction, suicide\). Woman have been silenced, blamed, or accused of lying. Courts have done little \(temporary restraining orders/shelters\). Society has been too quiet. No significant changes have happened to prevent abuse & save lives. A new movement is alive, a major transition - starting w/ a voice. Prevention is a goal. Getting it right is a challenge. Adjustments are inevitable.
1.4.6. Pro: Politicians are very rarely held to account for their improper behaviour.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Despite [several](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/nov/30/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-full-list) women coming forward to allege that Donald Trump had made unwanted sexual advances toward them, he was elected president—helped by [more than half](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/25/white-women-husbands-voting) of white women who voted for him.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: Support for Donald Trump among conservative white people was based on a wide range of issues, including his [opposition](http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-abortion-womens-health-platforms-positions-2016-11) to abortion, his promise to [appoint](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/280381-trump-unveils-list-of-11-potential-supreme-court-nominees) a conservative justice to the Supreme Court, and a general [loathing](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-distaste-for-both-trump-and-clinton-is-record-breaking/) for Hillary Clinton. It's plausible that many white women didn't discount the veracity of the claims against Trump, but decided he was the lesser of two evils.
1.4.6.1.1.1. Con: The fact that the Access Hollywood tape had minimal impact on white women's votes exposes the degree to which society fails to take sexual harassment and assault seriously when weighing it against other issues. Credible penalties for the accused would lead to a shift in the discourse.
1.4.6.2. Pro: Bill Clinton faced [multiple credible allegations](http://www.businessinsider.com/these-are-the-sexual-assault-allegations-against-bill-clinton-2017-11/#paula-jones-3) of sexual assault and harassment in the 1990s that did little to discredit him among his supporters and he continued to hold office.
1.4.7. Con: -> See 1.4.5.5.2.
1.4.8. Pro: It can take an incredibly long time for the accused person to be processed \(especially if they are in a particularly powerful position\), so even if they are in the end found guilty this will have allowed them to go on with the harassment for months or even years, and might not even have an impact on their career.
1.4.9. Pro: [Less than 2%](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/11/16685778/sexual-harassment-federal-courts) of job discrimination lawsuits - which includes sexual harassment - make it to a jury. Only around 4% receive damages. The system is irreparably broken, but for those in authority to lose their control would go some way in redressing the balance.
1.4.10. Pro: Consequences for these actions send a necessary message to those accused that these actions are not acceptable, leading to fewer instances in the future.
1.4.10.1. Con: One would hope so, but the potential consequences of arrest for any crime manages to not act as a deterrent; indeed, [re-offending rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism) illustrate that for some people, no consequence is severe enough to deter them from prohibited behaviour.
1.5. Con: Firing individuals based on credible accusations is counter-productive for the individuals and companies that the policy aims to help.
1.5.1. Pro: A zero tolerance approach to sexual harassment, resulting in immediate termination, will have negative consequences for women.
1.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.3.1.
1.5.1.2. Pro: People are often resentful of what they view as punishments that are too severe and may take out that resentment on the women who report their harassers.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Women won’t have a safe workplace if there’s no means of preventing low-level harassment without resorting to [firing](https://qz.com/1125385/zero-tolerance-sexual-harassment-policies-are-terrible-for-women/). If women worry that any offense, no matter how minor, could lead to someone losing their job, then small but troubling instances of sexual harassment could go unreported.
1.5.1.4. Pro: Strict, severe punishment could lead to men worrying about associating with women. This can be seriously detrimental to women’s careers and workplace relations.
1.5.1.4.1. Con: It would be severely detrimental to unprompted romantic advances, which could actually be a marked improvement within professional environments as more people save the flirting for Tinder and Bumble.
1.5.1.4.1.1. Con: [15% of people](https://www.reportlinker.com/insight/finding-love-online.html) find their significant others at work; it would be a shame to remove this possibility outright.
1.5.1.4.1.1.1. Con: There is a large difference between mutual attraction and sexual harassment. People who can’t understand that difference do not belong in society.
1.5.1.4.2. Pro: Polling has shown that [many](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/upshot/members-of-the-opposite-sex-at-work-gender-study.html) men and women in the US see a wide range of one-on-one situations with the opposite sex, such as private work meetings, dinners, or drinks, as inappropriate.
1.5.1.4.3. Pro: Companies have begun to establish [rules](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/lunches-hugs-and-break-room-banter-where-are-the-new-boundaries-at-work/2018/01/28/1911b700-013d-11e8-bb03-722769454f82_story.html?utm_term=.f11b9c181ae3) limiting interaction between co-workers, such as mixed-gender travel.
1.5.1.4.4. Pro: Men in [Silicon Valley](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/upshot/as-sexual-harassment-scandals-spook-men-it-can-backfire-for-women.html) have used sexual harassment scandals as an excuse to not have solo meetings or lunches with women.
1.5.1.4.4.1. Con: Their own unprofessional behavior does not warrant a full stop on zero tolerance, it simply hampers their own ability to rise as they feel incapable of acting professionally.
1.5.1.4.4.1.1. Con: It is not a fear of acting unprofessionally, but of being falsely smeared in yet another sexual assault scandal.
1.5.1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: None of the scandals so far have been false. This isn’t a reasonable fear.
1.5.1.4.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Very few of the scandals have been criminally investigated; as such, it is impossible to verify whether they are all unanimously true.
1.5.1.4.5. Pro: Building genuine relationships with senior people \(known as [sponsorship](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/jobs/sponsors-seen-as-crucial-for-womens-career-advancement.html?_r=1&)\) is the most important contributor to [career advancement](http://www.catalyst.org/media/catalyst-study-shows-sponsorship-key-womens-success).
1.5.1.4.5.1. Pro: According to [research](https://womenintheworkplace.com/), more men than women at every level say they interact with senior leaders at least once a week. This imbalance will likely increase and further hamper career advancement for women.
1.5.1.4.5.2. Pro: Managerial and leadership jobs are [predominantly held by men](http://www.womenatworkpoll.com/). Reduced interaction between men and women in a professional environment will hurt women more.
1.5.2. Pro: Those individuals who replace the ones removed as a result of committing acts of sexual assault or harassment will learn from the mistakes of their predecessors and get better at hiding their actions, so the problem gets pushed further underground.
1.5.2.1. Con: As the majority of people are not sexual abusers it is more likely that the replacement will instead not abuse anybody.
1.5.2.2. Con: Individuals who get credibly accused of sexual assault or harassment and yet retain their position of authority are more likely to be able to hide their actions better. This will be because they now know the mistakes that led to them being exposed, and they become confident that they do not have to face consequences for their actions.
1.5.2.3. Con: This isn't a reason not to fire these people. Those that conduct insider trading, bribery, or any other related offense in the workplace should not avoid being fired simply because another individual could 'learn' from their mistakes that led to them being caught.
1.5.2.4. Pro: The person might just change tactics so as to become less likely to be caught; for example, they might leave less of a digital footprint in their harassment, or make sure there are no witnesses to the harassment.
1.5.2.4.1. Con: People who commit sexual harassment or assault have an existing incentive to be as tactical as possible in doing so so as not to be caught.
1.5.2.4.2. Con: People are capable of change. Every person on Earth will have committed some form of misdeed, but these do not define them. Even hardened criminals are able to reform themselves and their lives. It is indicative of a very unforgiving worldview to make any criminals into perpetual pariahs, and forever assume their guilt \(or assume their desire to commit further crimes\).
1.5.2.4.3. Con: This is a terrible reason to not punish criminals
1.5.2.4.3.1. Pro: Fear of criminals not being caught is not a reason to avoid catching criminals.
1.5.2.4.4. Pro: This may have the positive effect of provoking investigators to update and alter their own tactics in catching perpetrators.
1.5.2.5. Pro: When people in positions of authority know that their actions will warrant consequences, they are more likely to threaten accusers in order to make them fear speaking out against them.
1.5.2.5.1. Con: Assaulters and harassers feeling threatened is an inevitable response to any successful method of removing them from power. The side-effects are unfortunate, but should not prevent action being taken.
1.5.2.5.2. Pro: Harvey Weinstein used threats to silence victims with [great effect](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ny-times-details-harvey-weinstein-settlements-threats-powerful-silencing-machine-1064765) over an extensive period of time.
1.5.3. Pro: Immediate termination of individuals credibly accused of sexual assault or harassment would harm the organization that they're a part of.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Removing senior people will often lead to inferior replacements being appointed after lengthy delays, impacting the efficiency of their organization.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: Given that it is in the interest of companies to both have multiple skilled people working for them and to minimise the delay in filling vacant positions, there is no reason to believe that an adequate replacement would not be found promptly.
1.5.3.1.2. Con: Positions of power should not give people immunity from the law.
1.5.3.1.2.1. Pro: If a senior member of an organization breaks a law and gets sentenced to prison, the same rule applies, and is overlooked. Simply because an individual is a good CEO and benefits their company does not excuse the action they've committed that's both detrimental to their organization and society as a whole.
1.5.3.1.3. Con: This is not a sound reason to keep those individuals employed because keeping sexual harassers in positions of power is detrimental to efficiency by ruining the reputation of the organisation.
1.5.3.1.4. Pro: Senior people were put there, most of the time, for a reason. They out-competed everyone else. If they weren't the best person for the job, they wouldn't have been there to begin with. This especially applies to people with long careers who might actually be irreplaceable; people like [Charlie Rose](http://uk.businessinsider.com/charlie-rose-harassment-not-wrongdoings-2017-11?r=US&IR=T), whose style of presenting and extensive experience was at the core of his popularity.
1.5.3.1.4.1. Con: No amount of talent or profit is worth tolerating sexual harassment or abuse
1.5.3.1.5. Con: A sexual predator is categorically the wrong person for any senior position, and therefore is never the optimal choice for their position.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Severe power imbalance is harmful to the organisation, and giving everyone the power to have anyone fired would reward the least ethical.
1.5.4. Pro: Firing people on the basis of the accusation rather than on the basis of the investigation will result in all of them being able to credibly claim that they were not investigated before being fired, making it harder to identify which people would have had the accusation substantiated if an investigation were performed.
1.5.4.1. Con: Most companies will use investigation procedures to determine if the accusations are credible.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Although it varies around the world, all large companies have investigation procedures in order to comply with labour legislation \(e.g. [US](https://www.hg.org/wrongful-termination.html), [UK](https://www.gov.uk/dismiss-staff), [China](https://www.chinalawblog.com/2015/04/terminating-china-employees-the-basics.html)\) that protects employees against unfair dismissal.
1.6. Pro: It is important to minimise the possibility that individuals will continue to be harassed and assaulted by those in a position of power or authority.
1.6.1. Pro: This is particularly true in the case of young, or even underage, victims; Anthony Rapp [was fourteen](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/30/16569228/kevin-spacey-assault-allegations-anthony-rapp) at the time of Kevin Spacey's sexual assault, for example. It is not merely a position of abusing career-related power, but the assumed power of an adult abusing the trust of a child.
1.6.2. Con: It is more important to maintain a just society, where people are given a fair chance to defend themselves in law before they are punished.
1.6.2.1. Con: Victims of sexual assault and harassment rarely receive justice for their suffering due to a combination of factors including, but not limited to, feeling too afraid to go to the police, prohibitive legal costs, shame and embarrassment felt during a public trial, and the prejudice of jurors. For such victims, society is already unjust.
1.6.2.2. Pro: Vigilante justice - both [online](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/how-online-vigilantes-are-hurting-the-justice-system/article11047378/) and in [real life](https://blogs.absolute.com/archive/the-dangers-in-vigilantism/) - is hugely detrimental to the criminal justice system, insofar as it impedes investigations and subjects targets to a type of 'mob justice' without due process. This is never acceptable.
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.2.
1.6.4. Pro: It is incredibly difficult to come forward about these matters because of fear of backlash from people in power. This removes that fear.
1.6.4.1. Con: Simply knowing that the abuser will be removed from their position of authority does not remove fear of backlash. It is possible that the person who has now been fired will seek to punish the victim for speaking up in a non-work environment.
1.6.5. Con: The accused will not necessarily change their behavior and could be hired elsewhere.
1.6.5.1. Con: Individuals dismissed for reasons of sexual assault or harassment are unlikely to be hired elsewhere, as most prospective employers seek references from previous employers so will likely find out about the reasons for the previous dismissal.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: Companies won't knowingly hire someone they suspect might perpetrate sexual assault or harassment against existing employees as this would leave them liable to a civil suit if such an incident occurred.
1.6.5.1.2. Pro: If another company does hire them, they will likely be on the lookout for such behaviour.
1.6.5.1.3. Con: In a number of cases, [those](https://jezebel.com/uc-berkeley-dean-accused-of-sexual-harassment-will-keep-1794437402) [who](https://www.denverpost.com/2018/02/13/randy-baumgardner-sexual-harassment-committee-chairmanship/) have been removed from positions of authority have done so 'voluntarily'; as such, their references from a previous employer will not play such a large role in overshadowing future job applications.
1.6.5.1.4. Con: This heightens the danger of false accusations: it is not simply firing a person from their job, but de facto destroying careers that could have spanned decades.
1.6.5.2. Con: If the person is hired elsewhere, they will likely change their behaviour as a result of experiencing being caught in their behaviour and the damage to their own livelihood in which being caught results.
1.6.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.4.
1.6.5.3. Pro: A process of rehabilitation and behaviour modification, with the incentive of eventual acceptance and forgiveness, would better reduce the risk that abusers pose to people around them, rather than firing them without any attempt any behaviour modification.
1.6.5.3.1. Con: Existing programmes for sexual rehabilitation [do not work](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11372442/Sex-therapy-in-prisons-does-not-stop-rapists-reoffending-warns-expert.html). Until such a time as reliable rehabilitation has been trialled, removal from positions of authority is a necessary precaution for perpetrators.
1.6.5.3.2. Con: Much of the threat in sexual assault comes from an imbalance and abuse of power structures. Removing an individual from a position of power necessarily removes their ability to abuse that position.
1.6.6. Con: Sexual assault and abuse are harmful physical attacks. Sexual harassment, which is uninvited speech, should not be lumped in with the others.
1.6.6.1. Pro: Sexual harassment is an unwelcome sexual advance. All propositions referencing sex could be defined as a sexual advance. It is unknown whether a sexual advance is unwanted. All speech referencing sex must be considered sexual harassment a priori.
1.6.7. Con: If there is a credible accusation of sexual harassment, the accused shouldn't be fired immediately, at least not one hundred percent of the time.  Many cases, especially verbal sexual harassment, can be dealt with by HR to stop the harassment and maintain the victim's safety without needing to resort to firing.
1.6.7.1. Con: Despite this, any forms of physical sexual harassment \(i.e. non-consensual groping\) are cases for immediate dismissal, along with multiple cases of verbal harassment against the same person.
1.6.8. Pro: The level of evidence required should be lower in cases where ongoing harm is possible because it establishes there is a likely risk it will happen again.
1.6.8.1. Con: A person should not lose his \(or her\) job unless there is credible evidence of wrongdoing.
1.6.8.2. Con: -> See 1.1.7.
1.6.8.3. Pro: For a teacher to be disbarred from the profession for life in the UK, it only needs to be proven [that it is more likely than not](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/495028/Teacher_Misconduct_The_Prohibition_of_Teachers_advice_updated_26_Jan_2016.pdf) that they committed the offence.
1.6.9. Pro: Individuals in position of authority can get away with inappropriate behavior more often than not since they have control and power over the people they are exploiting. Much like pedophiles are not allowed to be near schools, individuals who use positions of authority to exploit others should be removed so they cannot exploit others anymore.
1.6.9.1. Con: Paedophiles are barred from schools only after being convicted of wrongdoing; suspending anybody on accusation is a different matter.
1.7. Con: It is inappropriate for the employer to adjudicate the accusation as it ought to be done in a court of law, in which the accused is innocent until proven guilty.
1.7.1. Con: Removal from a job is not a criminal sanction: it does not require court proceedings.
1.7.1.1. Con: The sanction imposed is not the consideration which requires due process; it is rather the veracity of the accusation.
1.7.1.2. Con: However, [unfair dismissal](https://www.gov.uk/dismissal/unfair-and-constructive-dismissal) is very much a legal issue. Firing an employee on the grounds of hearsay would certainly constitute unfair dismissal.
1.7.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.4.
1.7.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.1.1.
1.7.1.2.3. Con: A credible accusation corroborated by testimony would form [a reasonable ground](http://www.ashbycohen.co.uk/blog/different-tests-for-wrongful-dismissal-and-unfair-dismissal-for-misconduct/) on which to fire the alleged harasser or assaulter, provided the employer investigated the incident.
1.7.2. Pro: Accusation, credible or otherwise, is never sufficient to determine guilt.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Credibility of accusation is an arbitrary standard which, if adopted, could have the effect of a "judgment without trial" towards the public opinion.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: The standard for punishment must be guilt. Any standard below legally determined guilt is irresponsible, as it includes the possibility of imposition of punishment on innocent parties.
1.7.2.1.2. Con: All standards are, to some extent, arbitrary. Employment law sets credibility standards, usually according to what is ['reasonable'](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/sme-library/smes-questions-answered/employment-law-sack-employee/). This is in line with such standards.
1.7.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.5.2.
1.7.2.2. Con: It is more than sufficient to warrant high levels of safeguarding, however; removing somebody from their position may be the most effective way to safeguard.
1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.4.5.
1.7.5. Pro: Employers have their own individual biases that make them inappropriate arbitrators of punishments of such severity.
1.7.5.1. Con: Creating a standard in which corporations fire those credibly accused of sexual misconduct helps create a societal norm around adjudicating such cases, which will check the individual biases of employers.
1.7.6. Pro: Automatically firing someone doesn't allow room for restorative justice or reeducation of individuals. If we resort to firing individuals because they have made bad decisions we might as well all get fired. We need to solve the problem of harassment and help people get the help they need so all of society gets better. Firing people from one job sweeps the problem under the rug and solves nothing.
1.7.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.3.
1.7.7. Con: -> See 1.4.5.6.1.
1.7.8. Con: Firing someone from their job is not mutually exclusive from bringing a legal case against them.
1.7.9. Con: Depending on local labor laws \(right to work in the U.S. and at will in many other locations\) firing an employee or contractor is not subject to any reason that isn't discriminatory based on a protected class. This makes the actual reason for termination moot.
1.7.10. Con: This is already a standard consequence of sexual harassment in the workplace- where good practice policy exists formal disciplinary action varies from final written warnings to instant dismissal. A complaint is judged on balance of probability and not on legal standards of evidence. The impact of the behavior and not the intention is considered.
1.7.11. Con: Using the workplace and your position in it to sexually harass is unacceptable. It is a breach of contract, both with the business and with your colleagues. Therefore if you breach that contract, the business should have the right to cancel your contract.
1.7.12. Pro: If other individuals within society who deviate from legal or societal norms are allowed to retain their positions unless they get sentenced, then those who commit sexual assault or harassment in positions of authority should be no different.
1.7.12.1. Con: Those who commit offences at work that seriously affect the welfare of those should be treated similarly severely. Other instances being swept under the carpet is not an argument for doing the same here.
1.7.12.2. Con: -> See 1.6.8.3.
1.7.12.3. Pro: Citizens in the U.S. have a constitutional right to due process.
1.7.12.3.1. Pro: The Constitution of the United States of America specifically grants jurisdiction to try felonies to the Supreme Court and its subordinate courts.
1.7.12.3.2. Con: The 5th Amendment does [not affect private companies](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-reid/private-sector-employees_b_12428414.html), only governmental institutions.
1.7.13. Con: Employers adjudicate disputes between employees frequently, and in serious cases fire employees found to be responsible for disruption in the workplace without the need for court proceedings.
1.7.13.1. Con: There exists a procedure between the accusation and the firing, namely, the said adjudication. Thus support for the right to private adjudication is not equivalent to support for the firing of persons credibly accused.
1.8. Pro: Due to the structure of the judiciary system it is possible to judged as not guilty even when most of the evidence and common sense point to guilt.
1.9. Con: It is often going to be difficult to determine how reliable or credible an accusation of harassment or assault is, and therefore this is not an appropriate system to use to determine a punishment.
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.2.2.3.
1.9.2. Pro: A credible claim is very circumstantial and equally provable or disprovable. For example, a rape trial just [collapsed in the U.K.](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-42696986) after previously undisclosed evidence came to light exonerating the defendant completely. Without that evidence, the claims were “credible”. People ought not to have their employment at risk for potentially vindictive or malicious claims.
1.9.2.1. Con: No, they are not equal. There are very real techniques used to test the validity of claims. In this case, pictures of the pair embracing does not affect whether a rape took place; many rapists scheme to show good affect in public afterwards to establish such 'evidence', sometimes threatening the victim to participate. This then makes the prosecution case harder, if not impossible, meaning the courts will not pursue it to a conviction.
1.9.3. Con: Investigations to determine whether an accusation holds more than a preponderance of the evidence are expensive, and costs are reduced by avoiding a full investigation.
1.9.4. Pro: The severity of the punishment and its potential impact on the accused's life justifies an extremely thorough system of investigation and adjudication.
1.9.4.1. Pro: Losing one's job is in the [top ten](https://paindoctor.com/top-10-stressful-life-events-holmes-rahe-stress-scale/) of most significant life stressors, and can be financially devastating. This would only be augmented should the accused turn out to be innocent.
1.9.5. Pro: Unfounded accusations could be considered "credible" just because they are based on dislike or prejudices against the accused.
1.9.5.1. Pro: The effects of rumour cannot be overstated. If we permit people to be fired on the basis of 'credible accusations', the ostensible 'credibility' will be more easy to obtain if rumours of somebody's behaviour is already rife. This is patently unfair.
1.9.5.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.1.1.
1.9.6. Pro: Sexual assault is a criminal offense and accusations of assault should be required to be reported to the police and handled by them. The terms of what constitutes a valid claim of harassment is something that seems too murky. Any claim of harassment should merit investigation by the company before action is taken, and to be honest firing someone without evidence of wrongdoing over an accusation like this should be terms for a lawsuit.
1.9.7. Pro: In this case metoo movement could be used by oportunistic people in order to eliminate competitors on their way to the top positions at work. That will undermine an entire idea behind the movement.
The very first case in which it will be proven that someone conspire with women to make a false but "credible" accusation would criple metoo movement extremely.
1.9.8. Con: In cases of harassment and/or assault there's often no evidence other than the victim's declaration
1.9.9. Con: -> See 1.6.8.
1.9.10. Pro: The current sexual harassment crisis - which has been predominantly played out on social media, with little or no legal repercussions - can inspire [internet vigilantism](https://inacrowdedtheater.com/2017/07/07/sexual-assault-and-internet-vigilantism/). If this continues to propagate, it can easily spiral out of control, and certainly cannot be used as the basis for punishment.
1.9.10.1. Con: Setting a standard to which corporations must adhere to in cases of credible sexual assault allegations diminishes the odds of internet vigilantism.
1.9.10.2. Pro: The [Gamergate controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy) is a fine example of internet vigilantism spiraling out of control. Female game developers and journalists faced an intense backlash which included harassment both on the web and off it. What initially started off as criticism devolved into an intense harassment campaign.
1.9.10.2.1. Con: Every Gamergate community has actively [discouraged interacting](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/wiki/rules) with any person of interest, or even calling them by name, to prevent harassment. Even on "free-speech" places like [Voat](https://voat.co/v/GamerGate) or [8chan](https://8ch.net/gamergatehq/index.html) they prohibited it.
1.9.10.2.2. Con: Any large group of people embroiled in a large-scale debate on the internet is going to have people acting in a way that the majority does not agree with. To paint the entire group based on the actions of relatively few, especially when they are frequently denounced by the larger group, is ignorant of how the internet works at best and disingenuous at worst.
1.9.11. Pro: There is no agreed upon standard for what constitutes sexual misconduct. It is therefore not fair to hand out punishment without due legal process for a crime which has no set objective yardstick as of yet.
1.9.11.1. Pro: While some cases are black and white, others such as the [Aziz Ansari](http://deadline.com/2018/01/aziz-ansari-allegations-sexual-encounter-metoo-1202242992/) case are not. [Some](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/aziz-ansari-sexual-assault-allegation-media-ethics-debate-privacy-babe-journalism-a8166106.html) feminist writers dismissed the incident as a bad date, whereas others thought it was a case of sexual assault.
1.9.11.2. Con: While certain grey areas might exist in a romantic setting, that is not the case in a professional setting. There exist guidelines, like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's [guidelines](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm) in the USA, in many countries that define sexual harassment at workplace.
1.9.12. Con: -> See 1.5.4.1.1.
1.10. Pro: Individuals who have been harassed or assaulted are more likely to feel comfortable coming forward if they believe there are going to be real consequences for the abuser.
1.10.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.
1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.
1.10.3. Con: People who aim to lie about sexual misconduct, to harm innocent people, are more likely to do so if they know that it will result in punishment of the victim, solely based on allegations they make.
1.10.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.
1.10.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.2.2.
1.10.3.3. Pro: The harm to innocent people who are accused could be particularly bad given the possibility of unchecked rumours and accusations spreading rapidly online via social media.
1.10.4. Pro: Sexual harassment is often committed by those [with economic power against those without](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/09/sexual-harassment-economic-inequality-harvey-weinstein): victims will only come forward if they know their abuser will be removed and cannot threaten their job security.
1.10.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.4.
1.10.5. Pro: It is particularly important that those in high-ranking positions are seen to be fired with the accompanying media coverage. Such actions create a climate that supports other victims in coming forward and knowing they will be taken seriously.
1.10.5.1. Con: Regrettably, this has the kickback effect of cynics claiming that the majority are 'jumping on the bandwagon' or falsifying accusations.
1.10.5.2. Pro: Although it took a number of years, [Dr. Luke's removal from Sony](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/sony-cuts-ties-controversial-pop-music-producer-dr-luke-997270) as a result of Kesha's allegations, and [Kesha's performance](https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/28/16943794/grammys-2018-kesha-performance-praying-times-up) as part of the #metoo movement at the Grammys produced major media coverage and showed women they could safely make allegations without fear.
1.10.5.2.1. Con: Kesha had the resources and the star power to endure the [complex](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/comeback-kesha-timeline-bitter-legal-feud-sony-dr-luke/) legal battle that transpired between her and Dr. Luke. Most women lack the resources to endure an emotionally and monetarily harrowing legal battle. Kesha's victory, while a victory for herself, and for other wealthy women does not necessarily translate into an equal victory for most women.
1.10.5.2.1.1. Pro: The same can be said for Taylor Swift, who sued [for just $1](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jonmichaelpoff/this-is-why-taylor-swift-is-suing-for-just-one-dollar?utm_term=.xsWpWG4bOj#.mlJDlnLaA4) against DJ David Mueller, a symbolic move that she was in the financial situation to survive. Most women do not have that luxury.
1.10.5.3. Con: Women who accuse high-profile figures of sexual assault or harassment often face [public backlash and abuse](https://splinternews.com/trump-stumps-for-accused-child-molester-attacks-moore-1821150147), discouraging others from coming forward.
1.10.6. Con: It is the role of the justice system, not the employer, to determine and enforce consequence.
