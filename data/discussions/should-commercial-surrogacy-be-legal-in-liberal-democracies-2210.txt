Discussion Title: Should Commercial Surrogacy be Legal in Liberal Democracies?

1. Commercial Surrogacy Should Be Legal In Liberal Democracies
1.1. Con: Commercial surrogacy raises legal issues about who has parental rights over the child.
1.1.1. Con: While absolutely true, the potential legal issues are a symptom, not a reason that commercial surrogacy should be illegal.
1.1.2. Con: If someone is paid to carry someone else's child \(or even agree to do it as a favor\) they should have no claim whatsoever on that child.
1.1.3. Con: As most legislations tend to favour biological parents, adoption as a method to start a family is not exempt of [legal](https://www.laurachristianson.com/laura/what-happens-when-birth-parents-want-their-child-back/) battles and yet it is legal.
1.1.4. Pro: As giving birth is a complex process with multiple medical, biological and emotional variables, it is unlikely that regulations or a contract can account for all the possibilities thus creating a legal conundrum harmful to all parties.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Gay parents were immersed in a legal [battle](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/26/gay-couple-win-custody-battle-against-thai-surrogate-mother) after the surrogate refused to sign the papers to allow them to take the baby to the US after she allegedly found out they were gay.
1.1.4.2. Pro: One of the [first](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/05/weekinreview/baby-m-s-future.html) cases of traditional commercial surrogacy \(in which the surrogate uses her own eggs\), known as the [Baby M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_M) case, had a long process of legal battles to establish parental rights over the child.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Due to the precedent set by the Baby M case, New Jersey recently encountered another case where the surrogate mother fought for custody after changing her mind. She was firstly given legal rights but another ruling gave custody to her brother, the [biological](http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/12/nj_gay_couple_fight_for_custod.html) father and sperm donor.
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: Even though judges tried to rule considering the “best interest of the child” the process had different [rulings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_M#Legal_significance) until custody was given to the couple who arranged the surrogacy and the surrogate mother was given visitation rights.
1.1.4.2.3. Pro: If legal proceedings stretch over time and the child is placed under the care of one party and swapped to the other, that can certainly be detrimental to the child’s wellbeing.
1.1.4.2.4. Con: Baby M's case happened in 1987 and, as stated, was the first case of traditional commercial surrogacy. Liberal democracies are now better equipped to account for the potential problems with regulating commercial surrogacy.
1.1.4.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.
1.1.4.2.5. Con: If there are clear regulations governing commercial surrogacy, then there will be no need for court cases establishing rights as they will be made clear in legislation.
1.1.4.3. Pro: A woman in California has [sued](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3608920/Surrogate-mother-48-gave-birth-triplets-despite-father-s-demand-abort-one-babies-couldn-t-afford-care-sues-custody.html) the commissioning father for demanding that she abort one of the three viable embryos she was pregnant with, as she considered it unconstitutional, and has unsuccessfully filed for [custody](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-surrogacy-idUSKCN0YU2G3).
1.1.5. Con: Legalising commercial surrogacy allows for regulations which could reduce the extent of these problems. For example, surrogates and prospective parents could sign contracts clearly stating who has parental rights.
1.1.5.1. Con: This is already the case in some states of the US that allow commercial surrogacy, and yet legal battles between prospective parents and surrogates over parental rights and other issues still happen.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.
1.1.5.1.3. Con: Legal battles over parentage reveal deficiencies over the comprehensiveness of legislation. If governments in liberal democracies are serious about allowing commercial surrogacy, they will create laws that clearly define the parental rights of parents and surrogates.
1.1.6. Pro: In this type of dispute, establishing an agreement that satisfies all parties is almost impossible. Judges cannot grant legal [joint](http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/12/nj_gay_couple_fight_for_custod.html) custody to both parties when strained relations make it impossible for them to agree upon basic considerations about the child’s life \(school, religion, politics, etc\).
1.2. Con: Commercial surrogacy practices commodify human life.
1.2.1. Pro: Commercial surrogacy commodifies babies by turning them into goods which can be purchased and sold.
1.2.1.1. Pro: This results in babies being treated as tradeable items of property rather than autonomous human beings.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Brian](http://sonofasurrogate.tripod.com/#), the author of a blog entitled “The Son of a Surrogate” affirms: “It looks to me like I was bought and sold.” On a similar blog, a self-identified surrogacy child speaks about the feeling of “[rejection](http://theothersideofsurrogacy.blogspot.com.es/)”.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: On the other hand, some children born through surrogacy have [spoken positively](http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4227189.htm) about it and feel very loved due to the effort their parents went through to have them.
1.2.1.2. Con: In commercial surrogacy, it is the woman’s reproductive services that are for sale, not the child.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: As there is a handover of the child from the surrogate to the intended parents, the baby can thus be equated to a good that has been exchanged.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: It would be illegal to treat a person like property in any liberal democracy.
1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: For example, following a commercial logic, if a fetus has a disability it can be seen as a ["faulty product"](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2014/sep/05/baby-must-not-become-faulty-product-when-surrogacy-doesnt-go-plan) that can be returned. It is immoral that prospective parents \(often also the biological ones\) can make these sort of decisions.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Children would not be seen as 'faulty products' under any legitimate and lawful surrogacy legislation.
1.2.1.2.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.1.
1.2.1.2.1.2.3. Pro: A British couple [rejected](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/children/11055643/British-mother-rejected-disabled-twin-because-she-was-a-dribbling-cabbage-says-surrogate.html) a twin girl born with a disability, forcing the surrogate mother and her husband to keep the child as their own.
1.2.1.2.1.2.4. Pro: Commercial surrogacy [entered the spotlight](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-14/baby-gammy-twin-must-remain-with-family-wa-court-rules/7326196) in Australia when baby Gammy, a twin, was left in Thailand, allegedly because the child had Down Syndrome.
1.2.1.2.1.2.4.1. Con: The Family Court of Australia [held](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-14/baby-gammy-twin-must-remain-with-family-wa-court-rules/7326196) that the family did not abandon Gammy in Thailand.
1.2.1.2.1.2.5. Pro: A surrogate in the US fled her state so she could be recognised as the child’s mother, after the intended parents pressured her to have an abortion after they discovered the baby had serious heart and brain [abnormalities](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/04/health/surrogacy-kelley-legal-battle/index.html).
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: In a similar manner, paying for the services of a matrimonial agency is not the same as buying a spouse \([Mclachlan & Swales, p. 97](http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1538&context=lcp)\).
1.2.1.3. Pro: Giving children in exchange of money erodes the social considerations of children and by extension, life.
1.2.2. Con: Other legal ways of having a baby \(e.g. adoption and IVF\) are similarly commercialised and profit driven. Surrogacy is not distinct from these.
1.2.2.1. Con: This could equally be seen as an argument to ban commercial and for-profit adoption as well as commercial surrogacy, and keep both processes altruistic.
1.2.2.2. Con: Adoption agencies are often charitable or not-for-profit [organisations](http://www.barnardos.org.au/about-us/about-our-organisation/) or public institutions.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: In continental Europe adoptions are [conducted](http://www.adoptionpolicy.org/pdf/eu-italy.pdf) by [public](http://www.adoptionpolicy.org/pdf/eu-france.pdf) [entities](http://www.adoptionpolicy.org/pdf/eu-spain.pdf) or non-profit [organisations](http://www.adoptionpolicy.org/pdf/eu-germany.pdf) under public supervision.
1.2.2.3. Con: Adoption is different in that much of the [revenue](http://www.adoptionbirthmothers.com/adoption-industry-profit-data-2015/) is used to fund programs for adoptive children and their prospective families, not profit.
1.2.2.4. Con: Adoption agencies may make money from adoption, but unlike in commercial surrogacy, the birth mother in an adoption does not turn a profit. This would practically equate to selling her baby.
1.2.2.5. Pro: The law around adoption agencies in places like the US still allows people to make massive [profits](http://www.ajc.com/news/local/nonprofit-adoption-agencies-often-profit-someone-other-than-children-families/h4HDsyDgyN1lEmrLxKaGcK/) as a result of adoption, meaning it occurs as a commercial transaction similar to how surrogacy would work.
1.2.2.5.1. Con: Laws require adoption agencies to be non-profit. The fact that said agencies manage to use legal loopholes to get [profit](http://www.ajc.com/news/local/nonprofit-adoption-agencies-often-profit-someone-other-than-children-families/h4HDsyDgyN1lEmrLxKaGcK/) is an indication that legislation needs to improve, yet it does not endorse or encourage adoption to be a commercial transaction.
1.2.3. Pro: Practices where body parts are used or sold for financial gain should not be legalised.
1.2.3.1. Pro: The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the [EU](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf) specifically prohibits using the human body and its parts as a source of financial gain.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Commercial surrogacy places monetary values on the womb, the egg and the sperm.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: It is currently [legal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_donation_laws_by_country) for men to donate their sperm and be compensated for it. Commercial surrogacy should not be seen as radically different to this, as both involve using the body for financial gain in a way that allows others to have children.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: The amount of time, effort, risk and loss of bodily autonomy that surrogacy involves is in no way comparable to [sperm](http://www.londonspermbank.com/london-sperm-bank-blog/entry/how-long-does-it-take-to-donate-sperm) or [egg](https://www.eggdonorcentral.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-donate-eggs/) donation.
1.2.3.2.1.2. Con: In most [legislations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_donation_laws_by_country), sperm and eggs are donated, not sold. Donors receive a [compensation](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/7958588/Egg-and-sperm-donors-could-get-up-to-800-in-payments.html) for their expenses but not a payment.
1.2.3.2.1.2.1. Con: There is no meaningful difference between a compensation and a payment.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Commercial surrogacy puts a price tag on medical [complications](https://www.westcoastsurrogacy.com/surrogate-program-for-intended-parents/surrogate-mother-cost) such as losing a tube, an ovary or a hysterectomy.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Con: It is only fair that surrogates should be compensated for medical complications. The same happens with [medical malpractice](http://www.abpla.org/what-is-malpractice) lawsuits, yet these are not criminalised.
1.2.3.2.2.1.1. Con: In cases of medical malpractice, the procedure that lead to it was medically necessary for the patient or, at least, involved a procedure that benefited the patient, e.g. cosmetic surgery. In surrogacy, these paid complications are the result of an unnecessary procedure that benefits a third party, not the patient.
1.2.3.2.3. Pro: For example, one article in the US records payments of $150,000 for commercial surrogacy. It [records](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/us/foreign-couples-heading-to-america-for-surrogate-pregnancies.html?hpw&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpHedThumbWell&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well) that: surrogates receive $20,000 to $30,000, egg donors $5,000 to $10,000, the fertility clinic and doctor $30,000, the surrogacy agency $20,000 and the lawyers $10,000.
1.2.3.3. Pro: The idea of providing surrogate services in exchange for a fee uses marketplace language.
1.2.3.4. Pro: No country allows selling humans and most countries have laws against child trafficking.
1.2.3.4.1. Pro: In [Paradiso and Campanelli v Italy](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{"itemid":\["001-170359"\]}), it was held by the European Court of Human Rights that when a genetically unrelated baby to the prospective parents was born in Russia to a Russian surrogate mother, the intended parents could not bring the child to Italy. It was regarded by the Court as human trafficking.
1.2.3.4.2. Pro: Some people consider commercial surrogacy to be the same as [human trafficking](https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/04/04/surrogate-parenthood-for-money-is-a-form-of-human-trafficking/#cda1c471202f).
1.2.3.5. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.
1.2.3.6. Con: Prostitution, one of the oldest forms of human commodification, is legal in over [49 countries](http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000772). Surrogacy should be no different if it is a mutual agreement among consenting adults.
1.2.3.6.1. Con: Governments have previously seen individuals selling their bodies as something which does harm society, which is why in a number of countries [prostitution is illegal.](http://chartsbin.com/view/snb)
1.2.3.6.1.1. Pro: When individuals sell their bodies, people view one another differently, as people are more likely to be seen as commodities and objects.
1.2.3.6.1.2. Pro: The selling of one's body, as in prostitution or commercial surrogacy, is particularly bad as it is likely to be the poorest women who are coerced into doing this out of desperation.
1.2.3.6.1.3. Con: However, there has been a trend worldwide towards the legalisation of regulated sex work.
1.2.3.6.1.3.1. Pro: Many current and former sex workers have created pro-legalisation movements such as [COYOTE](http://coyoteri.org/wp/), [PONY](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjx29ijqPXPAhWDoZQKHSh4AgQQFggjMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nswp.org%2Fmembers%2Fprostitutes-new-york-pony&usg=AFQjCNHuvYX1tR8spiDueg1zkv5jngDIrg&sig2=QKPAsVXR_tus8uia1wwnkw), and [many others](http://www.nswp.org/members/).
1.2.3.6.1.3.2. Pro: The [All India Network of Sex Workers](http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21629472-proper-debate-needed-legalising-sex-work-make-it-legal) argues that ending India’s de facto criminalisation of sex workers would make them less vulnerable.
1.2.3.6.1.3.3. Pro: Organisations such as Amnesty International, after much research and fieldwork, advocate for decriminalisation as a way to protect sex workers and persecute abusers.
1.2.3.6.1.3.4. Pro: A country regarded as progressive as the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_the_Netherlands) has legalised and regulated prostitution.
1.2.3.6.1.3.5. Pro: In recent years, countries such as New Zeeland, Australia \(depending on the region\), Austria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, Greece or France have legalised sex work \(even though soliciting or procuring is in most still illegal\).
1.2.3.6.1.3.6. Con: In many countries [legalization](http://prostitution.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=000120) has made it more difficult to prosecute abusers of sex workers because it removes the assumption that the transaction is wrong.
1.2.3.6.1.3.6.1. Pro: A New Zealand [government report](http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Does_Legalizing_Prostitution_Protect_Women_and_Girls_EN.pdf) reveals that despite decriminalization, abuse of sex workers continues.
1.2.3.6.1.3.6.2. Pro: In [2007](http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Does_Legalizing_Prostitution_Protect_Women_and_Girls_EN.pdf) the German government found that over one-third of prosecutors noted that legalizing sex work “made their work in prosecuting trafficking in human beings and pimping more difficult.”
1.2.3.6.2. Con: Prostitution involves a commercial transaction between two consenting adults, yet it does not involve the creation of another human being as part of that transaction.
1.2.3.7. Con: All labour involves the use of one's body or skills to make a product or provide a service for someone else. Surrogacy is simply the provision of a service.
1.2.3.7.1. Pro: All forms of manual labour to some degree commodify the body.
1.2.3.7.1.1. Con: However unlike most forms of manual labour, the essence of surrogacy is using a woman's womb for a commercial purpose, rather than combining manual labour with skills. For example, a carpenter lifting timber to construct the frame of a house.
1.2.3.7.2. Con: In other forms of labour, the final result or product is not a human being.
1.2.3.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.2.4. Pro: It is immoral to permit surrogacy full stop, as it inherently involves a commodification of a woman's body for the benefit of another family.
1.2.4.1. Con: Women should be free to choose what they want to do with their bodies.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: Commercial surrogacy compromises bodily integrity.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: In some cases, surrogates sign [contracts](http://sverigeskvinnolobby.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/POLICY-PAPER-SURROGACY-MOTHERHOOD.pdf) that dictate and limit their diet, sexual activity or exercise.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con: [Actors](http://www.cinemablend.com/new/6-Drastic-Ways-Christian-Bale-Changed-His-Look-Role-40621.html) also go through strict physical routines and dietary changes in order to fit in for a character. Furthermore they are also expected to look good or they do not get hired. This leads to many getting [extensive surgery](http://www.obsev.com/galleries/celebs-and-after-plastic-surgery/222852) which compromises bodily integrity too.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Actors are in a position to make choices about their appearance for roles. They therefore have a significant amount of control about the way they look. In contrast, once surrogates agree to commercial surrogacy, they have limited control over their bodies and cannot opt out. Actors can opt out at any time.
1.2.4.1.1.1.2. Con: Participating in sports compromises bodily integrity. Athletes cannot consume various drugs and have to stay in good physical condition. Their diet and exercise [is monitored](https://www.csipacific.ca/wp-content/pdfs/pp/performance-point-TID-1403-monitoring.pdf). Banning surrogacy but not sports is a double standard.
1.2.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Sacrifices made by elite athletes for sporting pursuits are different to surrogacy, as the elite athletes are choosing to follow the strict regime to participate in their chosen sport and can opt out at any time. In contrast, women who are surrogates cannot opt out.
1.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Some sport professionals cannot opt out of their contracts and are forced to complete a season \(unless they are injured\) therefore putting them in a similar situation to surrogates.
1.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Surrogates [can also choose](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/02/surrogacy-contract-melissa-cook/463323/) to have an abortion, therefore being rendered free of the physical burden upon them.
1.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Abortion health risks are [substantial](http://americanpregnancy.org/unplanned-pregnancy/abortion-side-effects/).
1.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Most health risks associated with abortion are mild and serious complications are [rare](http://americanpregnancy.org/unplanned-pregnancy/abortion-side-effects/).
1.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: In many contracts, if surrogates choose to abort, they won’t be monetarily compensated and could even have to pay damages.
1.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.2.3. Con: At a certain point in a pregnancy, [abortion](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/abortion-viability-gestational-age-state-bans/485384/) is no longer an [option](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9582428/Abortion-24-week-limit-QandA.html).
1.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: Surrogacy clinics in [India](https://www.academia.edu/235242/_Commercial_Surrogacy_in_India_Manufacturing_a_Perfect_Mother-Worker_2010_Signs_Journal_of_Women_in_Culture_and_Society_Vol_35_No._4) make the women live in their premises and completely control their schedule.
1.2.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Surrogacy in India was unregulated until recently; these conditions would likely not be allowed in a regulated market.
1.2.4.1.1.3. Pro: Some surrogacy contracts give the commissioning parents the right to decide regarding [abortion](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/02/surrogacy-contract-melissa-cook/463323/), thus negating the surrogate’s body autonomy and rights.
1.2.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: Under US law women cannot be forced to abort or be forced not to. As the surrogate’s right to abort or not is protected, the only solution in case of a dispute is to declare the contract void and suspend payment. Even still, legal [troubles](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/02/surrogacy-contract-melissa-cook/463323/) over the potential child or liability remain.
1.2.4.1.1.3.2. Con: Some professors argue that agreements regarding surrogacy \(including abortion\) should be enforceable. If it is not legal to force women to abort, even if women have previously agreed to do so under some circumstances, one possibility is to impose [damages](http://blogs.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2016/06/07/surrogacy-contracts-abortion-conditions-and-parenting-licenses-in-the-curious-case-of-cook-v-harding/) when that contract provision is broken.
1.2.4.1.1.3.3. Pro: Canadian law recognises that all women \(pregnant or not\) have the right to body [integrity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1800554/) and the right to make decisions regarding their bodies. The law views a gestating foetus as part of the woman’s body.
1.2.4.1.1.3.4. Pro: Most [European](http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/330090/4-Advancing-womens-sexual-reproductive-rights-in-Europe.pdf?ua=1) countries recognise women’s right to body autonomy including their capacity to decide over abortion.
1.2.4.1.1.4. Con: Other professions also compromise bodily integrity, and even at times, to a greater extent than commercial surrogacy but they are legal.
1.2.4.1.1.4.1. Pro: A wide-variety of industrial jobs carry serious health-risks, for example, [mining work](http://www.livescience.com/11173-miners-face-health-risks-good-days.html).
1.2.4.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: We allow people to join the military and go to war, even though this requires extensive training and can result in significant bodily harm or death.
1.2.4.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Military service can be characterised as service in the public good, with sacrifices necessary to protect the community. Commercial surrogacy in contrast is for the benefit of one family. The two therefore cannot be compared.
1.2.4.1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Given that legalising commercial surrogacy would likely benefit a huge number of families, the existence of this industry and the work of surrogates could also be considered a public service.
1.2.4.1.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Many soldiers live experiences that leave them with combat-related post-traumatic stress [disorder](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/18/collateral-damage-ex-soldiers-living-with-ptsd) \(PTSD\) for the rest of their lives.
1.2.4.1.1.4.1.1.3. Pro: Since 2001 a total of [8,377](http://icasualties.org/) US and UK soldiers have died or been [wounded](http://icasualties.org/OEF/USCasualtiesByState.aspx) in various military operations.
1.2.4.1.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.1.1.
1.2.4.1.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.1.2.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: The right to enter into or enforce a private agreement is not absolute.
1.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: Two individuals [cannot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_agreement) legally sign a contract to enslave one of them or to commit a crime.
1.2.4.1.2.2. Pro: Two individuals [cannot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_agreement) legally sign a contract so that one can kill the other.
1.2.4.1.2.3. Pro: Two or more individuals cannot enforce a contract if the terms of the contract are [unfair or unlawful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_agreement), regardless of their willingness to sign it.
1.2.4.1.3. Pro: People have the right to make choices in relation to their private lives.
1.2.4.1.3.1. Con: Surrogacy is uniquely difficult to consent to.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: One of the [conditions](https://philpapers.org/rec/KIRTGS-3) for an agreement to be exploitative is that the disadvantaged party enters into it not fully knowing the risks and burdens. In a lot of cases, this premise can be applied to commercial surrogacy.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The impacts of pregnancy on a person's body are wildly variable and nearly impossible to predict, let alone fairly compensate for. If women have not been pregnant before they may not understand the risks of what they are signing up for.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: A study conducted in Iran pointed out that a surrogate pregnancy should be considered a [high-risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4126251/) emotional experience for women acting as surrogates.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Most concerns of the women who participated in the study were family and friends’ reactions as well as religious tribulations. In secular countries with more gender equal policies, those concerns are likely to disappear.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Prospective parents enter into surrogacy agreements in Nepal, Ukraine or previously in India - developing booming surrogacy industries -  due to the [low](http://www.sensiblesurrogacy.com/surrogacy-costs/) prices these countries offer compared to the US. With such prices, the necessary care \(including counselling\) and legal protections for the surrogate are unlikely to be [available](https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2016/09/putting-price-reproduction-global-surrogacy-market/).
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Commercial surrogacy has considerable physical health risks and often involves considerable medical expenses.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.4.1.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: There are several health [risks](https://surrogacy.ca/resources/articles/53-risks-to-surrogate-mothers.html) associated with surrogacy, from mild side effects to really serious health complications, including [death](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-relatedmortality.htm). In the case of [IVF](http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/11666/1/What-Are-the-Risks-of-Surrogate-Motherhood.html) treatments, those risks include reactions to the medication, the increased possibility of multiple births and ectopic pregnancy.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: In less regulated markets like India, women are implanted with more than two embryos, which is the legal limit in the [UK](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/aug/08/medicalscience.highereducation). In one case a woman received six embryos. This highly increases risks for the surrogate and the [babies](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(12\)61933-3/fulltext).
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: These practices are indeed exploitative and risky, yet regulations would help improve safety for everyone involved better than a total banning.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Prospective parents who use surrogates in third-world countries see the implantation of more embryos [positively](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(12\)61933-3/fulltext), as it increases the chances of success and, if a multiple pregnancy does occur, they pay the same for one baby as for two.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: IVF-induced pregnancies resulting in multiple implants carry [risks](http://www.happybeginningseggdonation.com/risks_of_surrogacy) such as maternal hemorrhage, gestational diabetes, miscarriage, and pregnancy-related high blood pressure.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.2.3. Pro: Surrogacy pregnancies achieved through IVF are [more likely to result in twins or triplets](https://surrogate.com/surrogates/pregnancy-and-health/emotional-and-medical-risks-of-surrogacy/), and this carries higher risks than single foetus pregnancies.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.3. Con: Most risks are exactly the [same](https://surrogate.com/surrogates/pregnancy-and-health/emotional-and-medical-risks-of-surrogacy/) as in any pregnancy.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.2.2.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.3.3. Pro: Maternal mortality rates \(women dying due to causes related or aggravated by pregnancy\) are really [low](https://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=2223) in developed countries.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.3.3.1. Con: The US has experienced a [raise](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/health/maternal-mortality.html) in maternal mortality, specifically among poor black women. As most deaths are caused by cardiovascular complications, researchers believe the increase in obesity is the main factor.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.3.3.1.1. Con: Precisely to avoid [risks](http://www.circlesurrogacy.com/surrogates) associated with obesity, most US clinics [require](http://www.creatingfamilies.com/surrogate-mothers/?surrogate-requirements-56) that surrogates have a Body Mass Index \(BMI\) that does not exceed 31-33.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Considering that the Word Health Organisation sets the threshold of obesity at [30](http://apps.who.int/bmi/index.jsp?introPage=intro_3.html), it does not seem a very reasonable limit to ensure the surrogate’s health.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.3.3.1.2. Con: There are [many reasons](http://www.npr.org/2017/05/12/527806002/focus-on-infants-during-childbirth-leaves-u-s-moms-in-danger) for the increase in maternal mortality rates, including women waiting until later in life to conceive, focus more on infant health during childbirth, as well as a greater prevalence of C-sections.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.3.3.2. Con: Maternal mortality rates in countries that offer or used to offer surrogacy to foreigners like India or Nepal have rather [high](https://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=2223) mortality rates.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.3. Con: That is one of the reasons many clinics seek potential surrogates who have given [birth](http://www.creatingfamilies.com/surrogate-mothers/?surrogate-requirements-56) before so they understand the risks better. This provision could be legislated.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.5. Con: This can be resolved with a clear screening process with the surrogate ahead of time to warn them about the risks involved.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.5.1. Con: If the surrogate is in dire need of money, it will be very difficult for her to rationalize the risk of a pregnancy at the time when she is making the decision.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.5.2. Con: The [lack of informed consent](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-surrogate-mothers-india-idUSKBN0LY1J720150302) to medical procedures is a problem for surrogates in India. Many women are not made aware of the full risks involved or how many embryos are transferred.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: This is exploitative, as most of these women are illiterate and without the education necessary to help them fully comprehend the procedures.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.5.2.2. Con: These issues happened under India's previously unregulated market. If states legalise and regulate the market, this can be prevented.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: The regulations could impose a financial penalty if the basic health information is not provided to the surrogate.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.5.2.2.2. Pro: This regulation can require surrogates to give a verbal or written assessment to show that they fully comprehend all requirements and procedures.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.5.3. Pro: Without regulation, it would be impossible to mandate a proper screening process.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.2. Con: It would be possible to make it a legal requirement for commercial surrogates to consult a medical professional. The surrogates could be given a very detailed medical examination including warnings about the risks associated with pregnancies to help rectify the imbalance.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.5.2.
1.2.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: It is unclear whether a woman can ever truly consent to commercial surrogacy due to the power disparity and socio-economic conditions operating prior to entry into the agreement.
1.2.4.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.5.1.
1.2.4.1.3.1.2.2. Con: All decisions linked to a financial need are coercive. But this decision is far less coercive than a state ban that removes any choice at all from the woman.
1.2.4.1.3.1.3. Pro: Commercial surrogacy requires a long-time commitment \(nine months\) in which the surrogate or worker at a certain point cannot back down and terminate the contract, unlike many other jobs.
1.2.4.1.3.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.2.
1.2.4.1.3.1.4. Con: While there may be difficulties in ensuring consent under the status quo, many of these concerns can be resolved in a system where surrogates have to sign a contract clearly stating what they are consenting to.
1.2.4.1.3.1.4.1. Con: It is not simply a matter of whether surrogates can sign a contract, but whether we should ever give them the right to consent to something so complex and unique.
1.2.4.1.3.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.2.4.1.3.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.
1.2.4.1.3.2. Con: Commercial surrogacy does not exist in the private realm as it is necessarily a commercial contract between a family and the surrogate mother. As such, the government has a right to intervene and prohibit commercial surrogacy.
1.2.4.1.4. Pro: Commercial surrogacy is [not intrinsically different](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1376831/pdf/jmedeth00299-0027.pdf) from other forms of labour. Women should have the right to profit from the labour they can do.
1.2.4.1.4.1. Pro: Women in India have argued that the commercial ban on surrogacy means that surrogates will [clean houses and mop floors](https://www.ft.com/content/866643bc-7b19-11e6-ae24-f193b105145e?mhq5j=e3); the pay and conditions for jobs like this are worse than for surrogacy.
1.2.4.1.4.2. Con: Reproductive labour is different in nature than any other type of labour and therefore should not be commercialised \([Satz, p.177](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195311594.001.0001/acprof-9780195311594-chapter-5#p117)\).
1.2.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: Unlike other forms of labour, in some types of surrogacy, the surrogate and the final product of her work are genetically linked.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2. Pro: Unlike other forms of labour traditionally dominated by women \(including [sex work](http://www.businessinsider.com/there-are-42-million-prostitutes-in-the-world-and-heres-where-they-live-2012-1)\), surrogacy is the only one that can be performed exclusively by women \(or individuals with a uterus\).
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1. Con: This is no reason to ban the practice. If anything, it produces a unique economic benefit for women that governments should be supportive of.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: It is puritanical and misogynistic to restrict reproductive labour, particularly since only women can participate in it.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Every form of labour commodifies the body, yet only reproductive labour and surrogacy - both dominated by women - induce calls to 'protect women's bodies from commodification'.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: The idea that having children is 'unique' or 'special' and therefore not a legitimate form of paid labour has not prohibited men from donating their [sperm](https://www.nwcryobank.com/sperm-donation/) and getting compensation for it. Clearly, the inconsistency is gendered.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con: [Gamete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete_donation) donation is a usual practice: men can donate sperm and women can also donate eggs and be economically compensated for it - and to a higher degree as the procedure is more complex – so there is not a gendered division.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: We always allow humans to capitalise on skills and abilities that they have. To single out women's ability to carry children and say that this ability should not be used because it is intrinsic to their body draws an arbitrary line.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: In fact, some [authors](https://medium.com/festival-of-dangerous-ideas/stop-surrogacy-before-it-is-too-late-9910035a63f0) consider surrogacy as a form to liberate women from the responsibility of being able to have children and as a way to “deconstruct nuclear families and heterosexual norms.”
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4. Con: Laws regarding surrogacy always favour genetic links thus often using the body of a woman to support the lineage of a man.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: When women are unable to have a baby, surrogacy allows a heterosexual or a male same-sex couple to have a [genetic](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/05/feminist-history-surrogacy-how-much-right-should-pregnancy-give-woman-over-baby) child with the father’s genes. Yet when two women are unable to conceive, if they cannot provide an egg \(and therefore no genetic material\) laws make it very difficult for them to claim parental rights.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.1.1. Con: It is unfair to disadvantage infertile women in heterosexual relationships simply because other women are already disadvantaged.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.2. Con: In the cases where women have viable eggs but are unable to carry a child, the baby born through surrogacy does have a genetic link with both parents.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.2.1. Con: There are [three](http://fertilityhelp.com/fertility-options/) different surrogacy processes: using the surrogate’s egg \(traditional\), using a donor’s egg or using the intended mother’s egg \(both known as gestational\). As egg [problems](http://www.advancedfertility.com/surrogacy.htm) are more common than uterine problems, heterosexual couples who opt for surrogacy are likely to not use the intended mother’s egg.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.3. Pro: Surrogacy reinforces the notion that parental rights are just established by genetic links instead of by the actual act of parenting.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.3.1. Con: That a surrogate is paid fully acknowledges her important contribution. That the intended parents - who take the child home and care for them - are still the parents fully recognises parenting the child as the most important contribution.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.3.2. Pro: The [European Court of Human Rights](http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Surrogacy_ENG.pdf) ruled against a couple who had a child born through surrogacy who was not genetically related to them. They were also denied the possibility to adopt the child and the baby spent two years in a children’s home, with no official identity until given another name and birth certificate and placed with a foster family.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.3.2.1. Con: The ECHR decision was based on the state's desire to dissuade French couples from travelling abroad to access surrogacy. This would not be needed if countries like France simply legalised commercial surrogacy.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.3.3. Con: If surrogacy reinforces a notion that parental rights are defined by genetic links, a ban on surrogacy reinforces the notion that parental rights are defined by carrying a child and giving birth. This is equally inaccurate and unfair.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.3.3.1. Con: Carrying and delivering a child can be seen as the first step of parenting, and involves a higher degree of responsibility and care than just providing gametes \(either sperm or eggs\) through sexual intercourse.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.4. Pro: Infertility has [historically](https://www.acfs2000.com/history_of_infertility.html) been seen as women's [problem](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/10/foul-reign-of-the-biological-clock) and responsibility. Assisted reproductive technologies \(generally invented for a specific problem and then offered to any woman\) perpetuate this conception.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.4.1. Pro: In heterosexual couples, when infertility is detected in the man, often the option is to use IVF on the woman \(which involves invasive surgery, medication and is way more costly\) instead of using artificial insemination from a sperm donor which could be as effective[\(Stricker, p. 121\)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.ep11007191/abstract).
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.4.1.1. Con: When other options fail, IVF can have [better success rates](http://uscfertility.org/back-basics-difference-iui-ivf/). This is likely an important reason for the high rate of IVF.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.4.2. Pro: Regardless of the infertility diagnosis, most procedures have been conducted on the woman’s body. Researchers conclude that this has been caused by the historic lack of research about male infertility \([Johnson, p. 2](http://paa2010.princeton.edu/papers/100622)\).
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Even with newly developed techniques to address male infertility, most procedures are still conducted on women \(or on both to some degree\) making apparent the need for more “involvement of men’s bodies” [\(Johnson, p. 3\)](http://paa2010.princeton.edu/papers/100622).
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.5. Pro: Evidence suggests that men are less willing to adopt than women, which may lead women to pursue only biological parenthood only to satisfy their partners \([Strickler, p. 116](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.ep11007191/abstract)\).
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.6. Pro: Before regulations, US clinics started to recruit young and working class women to use as traditional surrogates. Often, ads were posted by [men](https://medium.com/festival-of-dangerous-ideas/stop-surrogacy-before-it-is-too-late-9910035a63f0) whose wives were infertile yet wanted to have children genetically related to them.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5. Con: Commercial surrogacy reinforces negative gender stereotypes and does not contribute to equality.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.1. Con: Women's capacity to carry children should not be regarded as a negative gender stereotype. Rather, it is a way that women contribute to society, and commercial surrogacy simply allows them to do this more broadly.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.2. Pro: Women who are surrogates may be called offensive names such as "human incubators, incubator's for men's sperm, a commodity in the reproductive marketplace and prostitutes" \([Andrews, p. 74](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1748-720X.1988.tb01053.x/abstract)\).
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.3. Pro: Commercial surrogacy defines parenthood in terms of genetic ties, equalling motherhood and fatherhood to the genetic material provided while ignoring the more extended contribution women provide in the birthing process \([Satz in Sovik, p. 117](http://www.bsu.edu/libraries/beneficencepress/stance/2011_spring/Book%20Review.pdf)\).
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.3.1.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4. Pro: Commercial surrogacy increases other people’s “access and control over women’s bodies and sexuality” \([Satz in Sovik, p. 117](http://faculty.capebretonu.ca/sstewart/satz%20prostitution.pdf)\).
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.1. Pro: If women’s bodies have been traditionally controlled and used by patriarchy through different systems, and only women are able to be surrogates, it is arguable that commercial surrogacy is a modern form of control and use of women’s bodies.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.3.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.1.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4. Pro: Commercial surrogacy involves several professionals such as doctors, nurses, lawyers and even brokers or agencies. It is difficult for women to assert their [agency](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(12\)61933-3/fulltext) through this process, particularly if they are poor and have less bargaining power: even if they are crucial to the process, they are also [disposable](https://www.academia.edu/235242/_Commercial_Surrogacy_in_India_Manufacturing_a_Perfect_Mother-Worker_2010_Signs_Journal_of_Women_in_Culture_and_Society_Vol_35_No._4) and replaceable.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1. Con: A regulated market could provide statutory protections for surrogates to ensure they have agency.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1. Pro: Having a regulated commercial surrogacy market means that the women who work as surrogates can be sure they will get paid.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: A regulated market would allow states to prosecute clinics and parents who exploit or fail to pay surrogates. They get no such protection under an unregulated market.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2. Con: Many surrogates may find legal recourse too expensive to access.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: Surrogates [need their own lawyers](https://surrogate.com/intended-parents/surrogacy-laws-and-legal-information/understanding-surrogacy-contracts/) to advocate for them and ensure the fairness of the contract. Many surrogates will be unable to afford a competent lawyer and will be faced with unfair or exploitative contracts.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2.2. Con: It is possible that government alternative dispute resolution bodies such as [Consumer Affairs Victoria](https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/) in Australia or equivalents elsewhere will have jurisdiction to moderate disputes between parties at low or minimal cost.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2.2.1. Con: However, professionals trained and accustomed to deal with consumer claims are likely not equipped nor prepared to deal with the complex legal and moral ramifications that arise in surrogacy disputes.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2.3. Con: This would improve under a legal market, where surrogacy contracts could be required to protect the surrogate's interests.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2.3.1. Con: Market regulations tend to favour those with bargaining and economic power. Therefore, it is likely regulations will protect prospective parents more than surrogates and prioritise their interests if a dispute arises.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: In the US, commercial surrogacy is regulated within consumer [rights](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2014/sep/05/baby-must-not-become-faulty-product-when-surrogacy-doesnt-go-plan) and thus buyers \(intended parents\) are more protected than sellers \(the surrogate\).
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Before banning surrogacy, [Thai](https://zenit.org/articles/australian-couple-rejects-surrogate-baby-born-with-down-s-syndrome/) law required surrogates to already have kids \(in case they lost that ability during the process\) and to be single \(as under Thai law the husbands would become the father\). This situation led to very vulnerable women entering into often exploitative surrogacy agreements.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2.3.1.1.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.3. Pro: There are often power imbalances between the women working as the surrogates and those paying them, for example, in terms of wealth. It is therefore important that all the parties involved are legally protected.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.4. Pro: Especially in transnational surrogacy, intended parents can claim breaches in the contract to [withhold](https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/02/21/inenglish/1487696447_837759.html) the surrogate’s money. Litigating among different jurisdictions is very difficult and costly, more so for low-income women.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.4.1. Con: Even if liberal democracies regulate the market, the litigation costs for surrogates may equally be too high, especially for low-income women.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2.3.1.1.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2.3.1.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.2. Pro: Regulation can guarantee the right of a wronged party to sue if the contract or their rights are violated. There is no such recourse in the status quo.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.3. Pro: The government can ensure a fair price and reasonable conditions for surrogates.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.3.1. Con: Governments do not regulate prices in most industries, including fertility treatments, therefore it is unlikely they can regulate surrogacy prices.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.3.1.1. Con: Governments regulate the minimum price for labour, including for the nurses and doctors who work in fertility clinics. Surrogates should not be any different.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.4. Pro: [Californian](https://www.fertilitysourcecompanies.com/ca-surrogacy-laws/) law regarding surrogacy requires that prospective parents and the surrogate both have separated legal representatives.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.5. Con: A ban on surrogacy controls women's bodies far more by cutting off their choice to engage in surrogacy.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.6. Con: Using women’s bodies to fulfil others’ needs reinforces the notion that female bodies are objects for consumption or use.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.7.1.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.6.2. Con: Commercial surrogacy compensates the work a woman does and, crucially, requires her full and informed consent. That undermines the notion that women's bodies are objects for consumption.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.6.3. Pro: Women’s bodies have historically been used and [sold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife_selling_\(English_custom\)) for the pleasure of others, particularly wealthier men. [Prostitutes](http://www.businessinsider.com/there-are-42-million-prostitutes-in-the-world-and-heres-where-they-live-2012-1) \(free or [enslaved](https://townhall.com/columnists/haleyhalverson/2014/08/22/slaves-of-prostitution-why-sex-trafficking-should-be-redefined-n1881456)\) have provided and still provide sexual gratification and surrogates can provide the possibility to have a genetically-related child.
1.2.4.1.4.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.1.
1.2.4.1.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.3.
1.2.4.1.4.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.
1.2.4.1.4.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.3.7.
1.2.4.1.4.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.7.2.
1.2.4.1.4.3. Con: In other types of labour, workers can alienate themselves from the work product. As sexuality and reproductive labour are a core part of a woman’s sense of self, it is not possible for them to alienate themselves and therefore reproductive labour should not be commodified.
1.2.4.1.4.3.1. Con: Sexuality and reproductive labour are not necessarily a core part of every woman's sense of self. If a sex worker can alienate herself from her work, a woman could alienate herself from her reproductive labour.
1.2.4.1.4.3.2. Con: One's ability to alienate him or herself from the work product of his or her labor is not a necessary prerequisite to the commodification of that work product. For example, a musician probably considers his ability to create music as a core part of his sense of self, but that musician is allowed to sell his ability to create music to a record label by way of contract, if s/he so chooses. The focus is the voluntary consent of the parties, not the musician's alienability from their musicality.
1.2.4.1.4.4. Pro: Compared to the labour intensive jobs that poor women often have to accept, choosing to be a surrogate may be a preferable option, particularly for women who have been pregnant before and therefore know what to expect.
1.2.4.1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.1.
1.2.4.1.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.7.
1.2.4.1.5. Pro: One of the ways that women have consistently been oppressed is through the legal and social control of their bodies. Giving women the right to choose what they do with their bodies is therefore a key part of their freedom from patriarchy.
1.2.4.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.
1.2.4.1.5.2. Pro: It should not be assumed that other people know what is best for women and their bodies. For example, women who have carried babies before likely know what to expect from a pregnancy and are therefore the only ones who should decide whether that is something they want to go through. If it is, that should be a legitimate choice.
1.2.4.1.5.3. Pro: Laws about abortion and contraceptive access seek to control the actions of people with uteri, and are generally seen to be anti-feminist. Banning commercial surrogacy can be viewed in the same way.
1.2.4.1.5.3.1. Con: However, there is a significant difference. While contraception and abortion are actions that are directly linked to the decisions people with a uterus can make about their bodies, in surrogacy those bodies are being used for a third-party.
1.2.4.1.5.3.2. Con: While most feminist organisations support contraception and abortion, a big number of them do not support surrogacy. In [Europe](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/03/left-wing-feminists-conservative-catholics-unite/520968/), numerous organisations have organised protests and demanded a [ban](http://sverigeskvinnolobby.se/en/project/feminist-no-to-surrogacy-motherhood/).
1.2.4.1.5.4. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.1.
1.2.4.1.6. Con: If women are coerced into working as surrogates then they are not making a free choice. Governments should therefore intervene to protect these women.
1.2.4.1.6.1. Con: Many harms can be avoided by implementing strict regulations for commercial surrogacy once legalised.
1.2.4.1.6.1.1. Pro: Women are far more likely to be coerced into surrogacy in an illegal market with no checks and balances.
1.2.4.1.6.2. Con: A better way for governments to intervene and protect these women is by making commercial surrogacy legal but safe, allowing women to make money from surrogacy while being protected by the state.
1.2.4.1.7. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.
1.2.4.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.
1.2.4.1.9. Pro: It should be up to the women entering these agreements to decide whether the harm is too great, not the state.
1.2.4.1.9.1. Con: Some women are desperate for money and so the context to their situation is important. Poor peoples' bodies should not become tools for rich people.
1.2.4.1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.
1.2.4.1.9.3. Pro: The state should only intervene when an individual's actions have a significant harm to the community.
1.2.4.1.9.3.1. Pro: Given commercial surrogacy simply seeks to provide a safe and legal way for women to help families have children who otherwise could not, it is difficult to see it amounting to a significant harm to the community.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2. Con: However, governments also intervene to prevent citizens from harming themselves.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1. Pro: Commercial surrogacy can be emotionally and psychologically harmful to surrogates.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.1. Pro: Elizabeth Kane, the first commercial surrogate in the US, now campaigns against commercial surrogacy, saying that a surrogate mother 'feels like a flesh covered test tube during the entire experience' \([Allis, p. 21](http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/articles/the-moral-implications-of-motherhood-by-hire/?galley=pdf)\).
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.1.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.3. Con: Professional psychological support systems can become a more stringent part of the surrogacy process to help mitigate the emotional challenges faced.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.1.2.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.4. Con: Available research on surrogates shows only positive outcomes.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.4.1. Con: They are all studies that have been conducted in developed economies, primarily the UK and the US. As such, they cannot account for the many surrogates in other countries.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.1.2.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.4.2. Pro: A study that followed up with surrogate mothers after ten years of relinquishing the child, found that they all remained [positive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25527614) about the experience, had good mental health and showed no negative long-term effects.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.4.3. Pro: Available [research](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/humupd/dml039) seems to conclude that, even though society at large is not fully acceptant of surrogacy, surrogate mothers and prospective parents adopt a very pragmatic approach that allows them to live the experience and to reconcile it with their beliefs.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.4.4. Pro: One [study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648314003538#bib0055) examining the long-term experience of surrogates  found that most of them showed no psychological health issues post-surrogacy.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.4.5. Pro: A study at [Cambridge University](http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/family-bonds-how-does-surrogacy-impact-on-relationships) found that many surrogates build positive relationships with the families they help.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.4.6. Pro: A [study](http://www.creatingfamilies.com/surrogacy/?surrogate-parenting-reassessing-human-bondingbrfont-size%3D2by-hilary-hanafin--ph.d.-font-size-167) from Los Angeles found that surrogates tend to think of the child as the intended parents' child, and do not feel a loss for them at the end of the pregnancy.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5. Pro: Surrogates are less likely to be part of the child's life in commercial arrangements, which can be emotionally challenging to overcome.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.1. Pro: Among families created through donation and surrogacy, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5324532/) show more positive family relationships and better adolescent well-being when information about biological origins has been disclosed before children were 7 years old.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.1.1. Con: If children show better adjustment and well-being when information about their biological origins is disclosed, that is a reason to regulate donation and surrogacy as open processes, yet not a reason to say they have harmful effects.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.2. Con: [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3155651/) comparing families conceived through egg donation, donor insemination and surrogacy, found that in the latter case, almost all parents tell their children how they were born.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.2.1. Con: Telling children that they are born via surrogacy may aggravate family issues. This can weaken the family connection as a result.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Even if the child wishes to meet their surrogate mother such an arrangement may be impossible as the surrogate mother may not wish to meet the child. This rejection would be extremely damaging to the child.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: In surrogacy, as is already happening with open adoptions, there is an increasing trend of families keeping in contact with gestational mothers, which seems to [improve](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4572724/#R130) the experience of all parties involved.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.4.5.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.2.1.1.2. Con: [Laws](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5033425/#fn11) mandate that information about donors has to be available to children in some countries \(some parts the US, Sweden, the UK and Germany, among others\) while in other countries \(France, Spain and Denmark\) donors have to remain completely anonymous. Therefore, the possibility to know about biological or gestational origins depends on how surrogacy is regulated but it is not a problem of surrogacy in itself.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Information on the surrogate mother is far more likely to be available in regulated markets in liberal democracies, while it is likely impossible to maintain open relationships in unregulated markets.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.2.1.2. Pro: The desire to know their surrogate mother may cause children to have some psychological distress as they try to distinguish between the birth parents, that society lays a big importance on, and the parents who actually nurtured them.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.1.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.2.1.3. Pro: This can put the child in a difficult position, where they do not want to hurt the feelings of the parents who raised them, but also want to know their biological or surrogate mother.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.2.1.3.1. Con: These problems can also arise in cases of adoption, where the adopted child wants to know their birth parents. This is a problem that can be overcome and should not be enough to justify banning commercial surrogacy.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.3. Pro: An altruistic surrogate is more likely to be a friend or relative of the parents. It is far easier for the child to understand the circumstances of their birth and why they came about in these situations.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.6. Pro: The women who carry the child may be traumatised by the process of giving up 'their' child after carrying it for 9 months.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.6.1. Pro: Many women who have worked as surrogates [have spoken of the pain](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-37050249) they experienced when they had to give up the child.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.3.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.4.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.6.4. Con: A study by the UK Department of Health found that only in a really small number of cases \(4 to 5%\), surrogacy arrangements were unsuccessful and surrogates refused to give up the child \([Brazier et al., p. 26](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110208100210/http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/\@dh/\@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_4014373.pdf)\).
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.6.4.1. Con: However, researchers also recognise that the evidence is partial \(as more cases need to be examined\); that the pain these circumstances generate should not be minimised and that the legal dispute the child may get into is a cause for concern \([Brazier et al., p. 26](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110208100210/http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/\@dh/\@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_4014373.pdf)\).
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.6.4.2. Con: The UK only allows [altruistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy#United_Kingdom) surrogacy and the surrogate mother retains the parental rights unless she decides to transfer them to the intended parents. These circumstances cannot be compared to commercial surrogacy in which contracts are enforceable and surrogates do not have the option to change their minds.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.4.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.4. Con: This is an argument for why surrogacy should be regulated, not necessarily illegal.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.4.1. Pro: Other activities like smoking [cigarettes](https://www.ttb.gov/rrd/federal_regulations.shtml) or drinking [alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alcohol_laws_of_the_United_States) are harmful and not illegal but regulated.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.5. Pro: That is why most legislations do not allow the use of drugs.
1.2.4.1.9.3.2.6. Pro: Most legislations do not allow the selling of organs.
1.2.4.1.9.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.3.6.1.
1.2.4.1.10. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.
1.2.4.1.11. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.
1.2.4.1.12. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.9.3.
1.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.6.1.2.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Treating a woman's body like a for-rent incubator dehumanises the woman by making her body and rights secondary to the baby's.
1.2.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.
1.2.4.5. Con: -> See 1.2.3.7.1.
1.2.5. Con: Treating people as commodities is common in capitalist logic and it is not wrong, as long as people are not treated only as mere objects.
1.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.7.1.
1.2.5.2. Con: As commodification is the valuing of something only for its productive use, there is no meaningful moral difference between commodification and objectification when applied to human beings. Both are wrong.
1.2.5.3. Pro: Commodification of humans in part or in whole is potentially extremely dangerous but seemingly inevitable - it seems better to get ahead of the curve and construct strong legal protections against abuse.
1.2.5.4. Pro: Models commodify their bodies to sell a product, yet that does not mean they give up their agency or humanity or that they should be regarded as objects.
1.2.6. Con: If commercial surrogacy raises moral and ethical issues for some people, regulations could permit altruistic and commercial surrogacy so those who do not want to commercialise the practice can choose not to do so.
1.3. Pro: The commercialisation of surrogacy enables the government to properly regulate the industry.
1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.3.2. Pro: The government would be able to obtain revenue through income taxation.
1.3.2.1. Con: Governments could get income from other not regulated or illegal activities \(prostitution, drugs or guns\), yet because they are considered harmful, potential revenues are less important than keeping these activities forbidden to the public.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Governments already get income through taxes on other fertility treatments, surrogacy should be included as well.
1.3.3. Pro: A regulated market protects the interests both of the women working as surrogates and of the parents who are paying the surrogate.
1.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Regulating the market could guarantee the familial status of children, protecting their parents from uncertainty and safeguarding their futures.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Regulating the market for surrogacy would also involve keeping records that would allow the child to find out more about their parentage later in life.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.2.1.1.2.1.
1.3.3.3. Pro: A legal market could implement regulations that ensure the health of the surrogate.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.
1.3.3.3.2. Pro: Medical testing could be required to ensure that the surrogate is healthy before the procedure is carried out.
1.3.3.3.3. Pro: For example, regulations could set age [limits](http://www.creatingfamilies.com/surrogate-mothers/?surrogate-requirements-56) for surrogates, as some US clinics do nowadays.
1.3.3.3.4. Pro: Regulations could also limit the number of times a woman can be a surrogate or limit the number of times she has been [pregnant](https://www.fertilitysourcecompanies.com/questions-for-the-surrogacy-source-how-many-times-is-too-many-to-be-a-surrogate/) before to qualify as a surrogate.
1.3.3.4. Pro: Regulation could set out a process for preventing disputes between the surrogate and the intended parents or resolve them if they arise.
1.3.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.3.3.4.2. Pro: [Californian](https://www.fertilitysourcecompanies.com/ca-surrogacy-laws/) law also requires that gestational surrogacy contracts must be notarized and signed before any medical proceedings start.
1.3.3.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.4.
1.3.3.5. Pro: A regulated market would require the involvement of ethical, registered health professionals and medical facilities.
1.3.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.3.
1.3.3.7. Con: As surrogacy contracts involve a product that is a human being and a provider who uses her reproductive functions in a permanent way, contracts can be very difficult to enforce or dissolve in case of disputes among parties.
1.3.3.7.1. Pro: In Europe, and partly in the US, most contracts for the provision of goods or services include the right to [withdrawal](http://www.ericposner.com/The%20Right%20to%20Withdraw%20in%20Contract%20Law.pdf). So if the goods or services provided are not adequate or consumers change their minds, they can void the contract and return the goods/services. That is ethically and morally very complex in surrogacy contracts.
1.3.3.7.1.1. Con: There are [exceptions](http://magyarefk.hu/en/useful-information/online-shoping/lack-of-right-of-withdrawal-from-the-contract.html) to these rules: airplane tickets or perishable foods, for example, thus there is no reason to assume that surrogacy agreements cannot have the specific provisions to ensure all parties have their rights guaranteed and which is the procedure in case of disputes.
1.3.3.7.1.2. Con: Surrogacy arrangements are different to ordinary commercial transactions because at a certain point it is impossible to prevent the baby from being born. As such, the right to withdrawal should not apply to surrogacy arrangements.
1.3.3.7.1.2.1. Con: The fact that surrogacy is different to any other ordinary commercial transaction, and cannot or should not have the same provisions, may be a good indication that surrogacy should therefore not be commercialised.
1.3.3.7.1.3. Con: As part or the totality of the baby's genes come from the intended parents, the surrogate only provides a service \(carrying the pregnancy to term\) and as such same protections that apply to any service-based industry can apply.
1.3.3.7.1.3.1. Con: However, unlike any other service, there is a human being involved that never consented to the process. If intended parents change their minds and refuse the child, these service-based protections are not designed to protect him or her.
1.3.3.7.1.3.2. Pro: Many services do not allow for returns, but do allow the customer to demand compensation. If you purchase an inadequate meal, failing internet service or an inferior education, those things cannot be returned, but your money can be.
1.3.3.7.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.3.3.7.1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2.3.1.1.
1.3.3.7.1.4. Pro: If commissioning parents decide to reject a child, they put the surrogate mother with the almost de facto obligation of keeping the baby, regardless of her situation.
1.3.3.7.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.2.3.
1.3.3.7.1.4.2. Con: If a child is rejected and the surrogate mother is unable to keep the child, it is possible that the child is put up for adoption or looked after by foster parents.
1.3.3.7.1.4.2.1. Con: When the child grows up and learns that they have been rejected by their prospective parents and their surrogate mother, no matter the love they receive from their adoptive mother, they may be traumatised and have strong feelings of rejection and defectiveness.
1.3.3.7.1.4.2.1.1. Con: These situations will likely be extremely rare, given how seriously parents will take the momentous decision to enter into a surrogacy agreement.
1.3.3.7.1.4.2.1.2. Con: Adopted children may feel trauma at finding out the circumstances of their births, but most overcome any adoption-related issues they experience and are as well-adjusted as anyone else \([Child Welfare Information Gateway, p. 7](https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubpdfs/f_adimpact.pdf)\).
1.3.3.7.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.2.4.
1.3.3.7.1.5. Con: If commercial surrogacy is properly regulated, then the government will be able to remove through legislation the right to withdrawal.
1.3.3.7.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.2.
1.3.3.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.3.
1.3.3.7.3. Con: If commercial surrogacy is properly regulated, then the government will be able to make the prospective parents raise the surrogate child as a matter of public policy.
1.3.3.7.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.3.3.8. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2.3.1.
1.3.3.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.2.
1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.3.3.7.
1.3.5. Pro: Making surrogacy difficult to access or unlawful brings it [underground](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(12\)61933-3/fulltext), increasing risks.
1.3.5.1. Pro: There will always be a demand for surrogacy and the demand will likely grow in the near future. Therefore, as long as there is demand, a market will emerge to meet that demand.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: Adoption is not necessarily the right option for all those who want to be parents, as it may be important to them to have a child who is biologically theirs.
1.3.5.1.1.1. Pro: It is important for parents to choose the path to family that works for them, otherwise their relationships with their children may become negative and difficult for both the parents and the children.
1.3.5.1.1.1.1. Con: However, if the path to start a family comes into conflict with other people’s rights and it is deemed harmful, governments can opt to not allow it.
1.3.5.1.1.2. Pro: Surrogacy gives men the option to have a child that is biologically their own, which some may prefer. Adoption does not provide this option.
1.3.5.1.1.3. Con: In many cases, women unable to conceive need to use the egg of the surrogate mother or a donor, therefore the baby is not genetically related to her.
1.3.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.2.1.
1.3.5.1.1.4. Con: In a male same-sex couple only one partner is able to be the sperm donor and therefore to pass his genes to the child.
1.3.5.1.1.4.1. Con: This might still be a preferable option for a same-sex couple if being a biological parent was particularly important to one of the parents and less so to the other.
1.3.5.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Culturally, most people tend to value [biological](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ethics-everyone/201202/parents-children-and-biological-ties) ties with their offspring, therefore, if one prospective parent is able to give up that option, there is no reason why both cannot do the same.
1.3.5.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Several studies conclude that with new fertility treatments, most parents prefer a biological child and thus adoption is the last resort \([van den Akker, p.55](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/humupd/dml039)\).
1.3.5.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.1.4.1.1.1.
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: The concept of surrogacy and its demand are not something modern. Traditional surrogacy is present in the [Bible](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2016) in the story of Sarah and Abraham and has been part of [ancient](http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/57389/8/08_chapter%202.pdf) cultures for centuries in India, Mesopotamia, Egypt or among Native Americans.
1.3.5.1.3. Pro: The traditional nuclear family is evolving and [changing](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/health/families.html?pagewanted=all). As more and more people decide to become parents in different [arrangements](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/24/families-evolved-language-words-relatedness-traditional) \(single parents, blended families, same-sex couples, [co-parenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coparenting)…\), the demand for surrogacy is likely to increase.
1.3.5.1.4. Pro: As women [postpone](http://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/12/21/making-babies-why-are-so-many-infertile.html) having children due to career reasons and men's [sperm](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/out-for-the-count-why-levels-of-sperm-in-men-are-falling-1954149.html) count decreases due to several factors, more and more couples nowadays have problems conceiving. This has provoked a surge in the use of [reproductive](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/17/health/record-ivf-use/index.html) technologies, including surrogacy.
1.3.5.1.5. Con: The actual or future demand does not justify legalisation if the activity is deemed harmful. There is also demand for drugs, guns or prostitution and most governments regulate or ban some of these activities.
1.3.5.1.5.1. Pro: Commercial surrogacy is harmful to children.
1.3.5.1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.
1.3.5.1.5.1.2. Pro: The children may feel a desire to get to know their surrogate mother.

1.3.5.1.5.1.2.6. Con: Some parents may choose not to disclose the details of the child's birth, in which case, no harm is done.
1.3.5.1.5.1.2.6.1. Con: If the child finds out at a later date that their parents have kept the information from them it is likely that the child will suffer greater psychological harm than if they were aware from the outset.
1.3.5.1.5.1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Research has already shown that families created through surrogacy have [less positive mother-child interaction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3210890/) than natural conception families. Increasing distrust between the child and the parents would exacerbate this.
1.3.5.1.5.1.2.6.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.5.1.
1.3.5.1.5.1.2.7. Con: This does not necessarily have to be a bad thing. Many children have blended families with multiple parents without it being something that harms them.

1.3.5.1.5.1.3. Pro: When children are old enough to realise that they had a surrogate mother, they may feel distressed with the circumstances surrounding their birth.
1.3.5.1.5.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.3.5.1.5.1.3.2. Con: Sperm donation is a commercial transaction. Children born with the help of a [sperm donor](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11938713/Sperm-donor-children-are-fine-without-fathers-says-Cambridge-University.html) do not suffer more psychologically or emotionally than those conceived naturally.
1.3.5.1.5.1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.2.
1.3.5.1.5.1.3.2.2. Pro: In 7-year-old children born through sperm [donation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3075381/), egg donation or conceived naturally, no differences were found in terms of psychological adjustment or maternal bonds. These findings confirm previous studies that had similar outcomes when assistive reproduction was less common.
1.3.5.1.5.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Different studies, conducted by a similar team of researchers, compared and found that children conceived naturally vs children conceived via donors \([2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3075381/) and [2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4886836/)\) did not have different outcomes. However, when including children born via [surrogacy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586757/), worse outcomes were reported.
1.3.5.1.5.1.3.2.3. Con: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586757/) showed that it is [more difficult](http://www.today.com/health/new-study-tracks-emotional-health-surrogate-kids-6C10366818) for children to deal with the idea that they developed and were born of another woman's womb than they would be with the idea that they are not the biological child of one or both parents.
1.3.5.1.5.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: A child may find the situation even more difficult when they discover that they were born as a result of a commercial transaction.
1.3.5.1.5.1.3.2.3.1.1. Con: Children born through surrogacy may be [aware](http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4227189.htm) of how much effort their parents went to in order to have them, and feel very loved as a result.
1.3.5.1.5.1.3.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Children and adults can also feel distressed and as a commodity when they realise they were conceived through a surrogacy agreement.
1.3.5.1.5.1.3.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: An adult who as a child was born through a surrogacy arrangement has campaigned to outlaw the practice stating that she would not have chosen it for herself and that it is “[degrading](http://nypost.com/2014/06/16/children-of-surrogacy-campaign-to-outlaw-the-practice/)”.

1.3.5.1.5.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.5.1.3.2.3.
1.3.5.1.5.1.4. Con: Available research, although limited as commercial surrogacy is a rather new procedure, concludes that children born from surrogate agreements \(either traditional or gestational\) do not experience any [negative](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/humrep/det410) consequences.
1.3.5.1.5.1.4.1. Pro: [Bonds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3210890/) between mothers and children aged seven and children’s adjustments show no difference between traditionally conceived families and those formed through surrogacy.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5. Con: While some children are brought into the world by accident and are unwanted, the children brought into the world as a result of surrogacy are very wanted and are therefore likely to be part of loving and supportive families.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.5.1.3.2.3.1.1.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.2. Con: Wanting a biological child and having the economic means and time to pursue that desire does not necessarily entail good parenting in the long run.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.3. Pro: In the first year of the baby’s life, families formed through surrogacy showed greater enjoyment and greater [psychological](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15122966) well-being and adaptation to parenthood than those formed by natural conception.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.4. Con: Some children born from surrogacy are unwanted and, in some cases, abandoned due to physical or mental disabilities.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.2.4.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.2.3.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.5. Con: Although a rare occurrence, there are some examples of parents using surrogacy to have children who they intend to sexually abuse.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.5.1. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that the rate of abuse is higher in families created through surrogacy.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.5.1.1. Pro: Studies in the US show that [21%](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/194972.pdf) of youth abuse is perpetrated by a family member \(father, step-father, brother, etc…\). Abuse is indeed present in traditionally-created families, yet it is likely that similar patterns happen in families created through surrogacy.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.5.2. Pro: In [Australia](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-19/victorian-man-jailed-for-sexually-abusing-surrogate-twins/7428720) a man was charged for trafficking and sexually abusing his twin surrogate baby daughters.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.5.3. Pro: In America, a couple were [imprisoned](http://www.smh.com.au/national/named-the-australian-paedophile-jailed-for-40-years-20130630-2p5da.html) for sexually abusing their son and trafficking him to other child molesters. They had paid a Russian surrogate mother $8000 to carry the boy and had always intended to sexually abuse him.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.6. Pro: A child of surrogacy will never have to worry about whether their parents wanted them or whether they 'should have' been born. These feelings can cause distress for children and adults alike.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.7. Con: A Japanese single male had 13 surrogate children in Thailand who he [intended](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-09/japanese-businessman-fathered-13-surrogate-babies-in-thailand2/5660482) to make work in his company. He kept 9 of the children in a nursery and rarely visited them.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.7.1. Con: A regulated market could require parents to be screened in the same way adoptive parents are.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.7.2. Con: The fact that this man was caught shows that individuals would not be able to get away with this.
1.3.5.1.5.1.5.7.3. Con: This singular example is not a representative sample of how the majority population will use it, or how the children born of it will be treated.
1.3.5.1.5.1.6. Pro: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3210890/) from Cambridge found that surrogate families had less positive mother-child interaction than natural conception families.
1.3.5.1.5.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.5.1.4.1.
1.3.5.1.5.1.6.2. Con: As the study includes families formed through egg donation and surrogacy \(gestational and traditional\) it is possible to assert that those findings may be explained by several factors, including the lack of genetic link, probably more important than the absence of a gestational link.
1.3.5.1.5.2. Con: If the legislation can mitigate those harms, it is absolutely justified.
1.3.5.1.5.3. Pro: Commercial surrogacy is harmful to surrogate mothers.
1.3.5.1.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.
1.3.5.1.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.
1.3.5.1.5.3.3. Pro: It uses women as tools for the use of rich people.
1.3.5.1.5.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.
1.3.5.1.5.3.5. Pro: Women who act as surrogates are likely to be shamed and criticised.
1.3.5.1.5.3.5.1. Pro: As motherhood is still considered a primal aspect of womanhood in most societies, and a lot of women who do not have children are often shamed or questioned, it is likely that women who decide to carry a child to give it away will be criticised.
1.3.5.1.5.3.5.1.1. Pro: Public acceptance of surrogacy tends to be limited \([van den Akker, p. 54](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/humupd/dml039)\).
1.3.5.1.5.3.5.1.2. Con: Alternatively, a surrogate could be seen as giving other women the chance to also experience motherhood, which could be a very positive experience. This does not have to take away from the surrogate's own experiences of motherhood.
1.3.5.1.5.3.5.1.3. Pro: As attitudes towards surrogacy are ambivalent or sometimes negative and surrogates tend to get less familiar and social support, which is needed for their psychological well-being, it is likely surrogates may be particularly vulnerable during the process [\(Edelmann, p. 127\)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247514026_Surrogacy_The_Psychological_Issues).
1.3.5.1.5.3.5.2. Pro: Socially, women who are surrogate mothers will be ostracised by the community as their work is not considered a valuable contribution.
1.3.5.1.5.3.5.2.1. Con: However, studies show that surrogate mothers stated that the experience boosts feelings of “self-worth and self-confidence” [\(van den Akker, p. 56\)](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/humupd/dml039).
1.3.5.1.5.3.5.2.2. Con: "Valuable contribution" is relative, as it would be very valuable for a family who could not have children by other means to have a child through surrogacy.
1.3.5.1.5.3.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.2.
1.3.5.1.5.3.5.3. Con: If surrogacy is legalised and more comprehensive information is available, it is likely that the process and those involved in it will be more socially accepted.
1.3.5.1.5.3.6. Con: Commercial surrogacy often gives women access to better quality healthcare than they could otherwise afford.
1.3.5.1.5.3.6.1. Con: The [healthcare](https://www.westcoastsurrogacy.com/surrogate-program-for-intended-parents/surrogate-mother-cost) is only available during the pregnancy or a little while after and for matters related to it. Therefore, surrogates only receive healthcare for something they would not need care for if it was not for the surrogacy agreement.
1.3.5.1.5.3.6.2. Con: To diminish [costs](https://www.westcoastsurrogacy.com/surrogate-program-for-intended-parents/surrogate-mother-cost), intended parents may use the surrogate’s health [insurance](https://www.westcoastsurrogacy.com/surrogate-program-for-intended-parents/surrogacy-faq-for-intended-parents) if possible. Therefore she will receive the same care that she normally receives.
1.3.5.1.5.3.6.3. Con: In countries with no universal healthcare like the US, when surrogates do not have health insurance, intended [parents](https://surrogate.com/intended-parents/surrogacy-laws-and-legal-information/where-can-i-find-surrogacy-insurance/) can purchase a [specific](https://www.newlifeagency.com/sales/products/surrogacy/) one to cover the time of the pregnancy or even just pay for the pregnancy costs with [no insurance](https://www.adoptivefamilies.com/how-to-adopt/surrogacy-cost-and-health-insurance/).
1.3.5.1.5.3.6.4. Pro: If the surrogate mother is uninsured, the [intended parents](https://surrogate.com/intended-parents/surrogacy-laws-and-legal-information/where-can-i-find-surrogacy-insurance/) are typically responsible for providing prenatal medical care, which is likely to be of better quality than the surrogate can pay for out-of-pocket.
1.3.5.1.5.3.7. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.9.3.2.1.4.
1.3.5.1.5.3.8. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.9.
1.3.5.1.6. Con: The demand can be mitigated by other options, such as facilitating and improving adoption processes.
1.3.5.1.6.1. Pro: Adoption is a more appropriate mechanism for childless families to have children.
1.3.5.1.6.1.1. Con: Many adoptive children come from foster systems where they have been [neglected or abused](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/singletons/200810/why-more-people-don-t-adopt). These children need a level of expert care and resources that not every family can provide.
1.3.5.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Several studies have pointed out that adopted children are more likely to develop [behavioural](http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1307&context=honors) problems.
1.3.5.1.6.1.1.2. Pro: Especially in international adoptions, children are at higher risk of suffering mental [disorders](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/04/13/children.adoption.mental.health/index.html).
1.3.5.1.6.1.1.3. Con: More resources, expert support and education can counterbalance this situation, so that more families are equipped to deal with children who need specific care.
1.3.5.1.6.1.1.4. Con: Precisely because of these situations, these children are even more in need of loving and caring environments. Since they are the responsibility of the state, the state should help provide enough resources so these children can find suitable families.
1.3.5.1.6.1.2. Con: Commercial surrogacy provides parents with the opportunity to have children without a lengthy waiting period for an adoption to occur.
1.3.5.1.6.1.2.1. Con: Children waiting to be adopted are in great need of a loving family. Prospective parents should recognise this and be willing to favour non-biological adopted children.
1.3.5.1.6.1.2.2. Con: There are [thousands of older children](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865578356/Adoption-often-leaves-older-children-behind-alone-but-waiting-families-change-the-future.html) in the care system waiting to be adopted, if more families were willing to adopt older children.
1.3.5.1.6.1.2.3. Con: Some governments such as the [UK](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/11208986/Adoption-Why-Id-rather-adopt-than-give-birth-to-my-own-child.html) have made efforts to cut waiting times, bureaucracy and costs so more willing families are able to adopt.
1.3.5.1.6.1.2.4. Pro: According to [Sensible Surrogacy](http://www.sensiblesurrogacy.com/what-is-surrogacy/), the wait for adoption can be years, while surrogacy is closer to 12 months.
1.3.5.1.6.1.2.5. Pro: For some people, especially for younger women, IVF and other treatments can be successful after a short period of time, and therefore can be considerably [cheaper](https://www.today.com/parents/ivf-versus-adoption-why-just-adopt-not-answer-1C7398701) than adoption.
1.3.5.1.6.1.2.5.1. Con: In the UK, even altruistic surrogacy can cost between [£7,000 and £15,000](https://www.surrogacyuk.org/intended_parents/your-questions-answered), since the intended parents must pay all costs relating to the pregnancy.
1.3.5.1.6.1.2.5.1.1. Pro: A domestic adoption in the UK costs only [£160](http://adoptcymru.isonlinehere.com/blog/en/how-much-does-it-cost-to-adopt-a-child/). Even a more expensive international adoption costs less than £2,000 plus the cost of the parents' flights.
1.3.5.1.6.1.2.5.2. Con: The average cost of a commercial surrogacy in the USA is between [$80,000 and $120,000](http://pregnancy.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Average_Cost_of_Surrogacy). Even if using IVF in altruistic surrogacy can be in some cases cheaper than adoption, commercial surrogacy is certainly not.
1.3.5.1.6.1.3. Con: Unfortunately, there have been multiple cases of adoption agencies discriminating against minorities attempting to adopt. A surrogate allows victims of discrimination to still have a family.
1.3.5.1.6.1.4. Pro: For a state, citizens adopting children already under its protection reduces the burden of care services. From a state's perspective, commercial surrogacy could let individuals avoid adoption entirely, favoring the possibility to have their own biological children.
1.3.5.1.6.1.4.1. Pro: A better state policy would therefore encourage adoption rather than discourage it by allowing commercial surrogacy. If families cannot have children through surrogate mothers but really want children, they will be compelled to seek adoption.
1.3.5.1.6.1.4.2. Con: For altruistic reasons, people will continue to adopt children because they will desire to help enrich the life of a child who for whatever reason is available for adoption.
1.3.5.1.6.1.4.3. Con: People may have ethical qualms about commercial surrogacy. This means that despite commercial surrogacy being legalised, they will not want to engage in surrogacy and so will favour adoption.
1.3.5.1.6.1.5. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.1.
1.3.5.1.6.1.6. Con: While it may be possible to adopt children, this is not always the case for various reasons.
1.3.5.1.6.1.6.1. Pro: It is often difficult to adopt children due to restrictive laws, particularly governing older children.
1.3.5.1.6.1.6.1.1. Con: These laws could be reviewed to increase the number of children available to be adopted.  The necessity of minors in finding a home should be a higher priority than biological parental rights.
1.3.5.1.6.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.2.3.
1.3.5.1.6.1.6.1.2. Pro: In [Victoria, Australia](http://www.dhs.vic.gov.au/for-individuals/children,-families-and-young-people/adoption-and-permanent-care), children at risk of harm from their biological parents are taken to live with foster parents. However, there is a legal presumption that the children will one day return to their biological parents. As such, it can be many years before a foster parent is legally able to adopt their foster child.
1.3.5.1.6.1.6.1.3. Pro: In [Spain](https://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/handle/10230/21815/TFG_Economics%20of%20Infertility.pdf;sequence=1) there are more children in the care system than adoptive parents. However, children are only adoptable when they do not have known parents, when parents consent to adoption or when a judge deprives parents of their parental rights. As the top priority is for the children to return to their parents, foster care is possible but full adoption is difficult or unlikely.
1.3.5.1.6.1.6.1.4. Pro: In most European legislations, biological parents have to consent to adoption. Although in some cases the state can waive that consent, the conflict between the biological parents' rights and the child’s interests, as well as the intention to keep parental ties, can make the process of full adoption difficult \([European Commission p. 20-21](https://www.google.es/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj5jcSmid7VAhXoIcAKHXXGC0YQFggvMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fe-justice.europa.eu%2FfileDownload.do%3Fid%3D45ac4453-12f2-4165-853d-67ec3cc8c057&usg=AFQjCNFKhOnxWlzYzCRKjQoQ7f8V6e2aug)\).
1.3.5.1.6.1.6.2. Pro: Some countries simply do not have enough adoptive children for the number of parents who might want to adopt.
1.3.5.1.6.1.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.2.2.
1.3.5.1.6.1.6.2.2. Pro: The number of adoptive children in the mainstream system in the UK has [fallen dramatically](https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/jan/20/adoption-social-work-child-munby), leading to an increase in the number of parents turned down.
1.3.5.1.6.1.6.2.3. Pro: There were [fewer than 100](https://www.aai.gov.ie/images/General-Statistics-2013-to-2016.pdf) adoption orders granted in Ireland in 2016. Adoption is not a realistic option for Irish parents.
1.3.5.1.6.1.6.2.4. Pro: An expert on the American system [said](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/singletons/200810/why-more-people-don-t-adopt) in 2008 that there were "simply not enough newborns and babies to go around."
1.3.5.1.6.1.6.3. Pro: Some potential adoptive parents are [turned down](https://www.familyeducation.com/life/social-workers/when-you-are-turned-down-adoptive-parent) by adoption agencies. This should not bar them from starting a family.
1.3.5.1.6.1.6.3.1. Con: It is unfair and discriminatory that couples with infertility issues that need third party assistance need to be deemed apt if they choose adoption, yet no similar regulations are required for couples opting for surrogacy.
1.3.5.1.6.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: The Australian father who allegedly abandoned Gammy, a baby with Down Syndrome in Thailand, was later found out to be a [convicted](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/baby-gammy-australian-father-who-abandoned-down-syndrome-surrogate-child-now-tries-to-access-funds-10261916.html) sex offender. While people with such convictions are [not permitted](http://www.dhs.vic.gov.au/for-individuals/children,-families-and-young-people/adoption-and-permanent-care/adoption-and-permanent-care-frequently-asked-questions) to adopt, no regulations are applied to those who undergo surrogacy.
1.3.5.1.6.1.6.3.2. Con: There might be valid reasons for these parents to be turned down.
1.3.5.1.6.1.7. Pro: The genetic parents will legally lose their parental rights over a child when that child is officially adopted. This thereby creates greater certainty as to who has parental rights and responsibilities.
1.3.5.1.6.1.8. Pro: With so many children in the world who need loving families, the better thing for people who want families to do would be to adopt one of those children.
1.3.5.1.6.1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.6.
1.3.5.1.6.1.8.2. Pro: Even within liberal democracies such as the UK, there are often [not enough](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/09/not-enough-adoption-placements-children) parents who want to adopt.
1.3.5.1.6.1.8.3. Pro: In fact, it may be an immoral choice to seek medical and commercial techniques to start a family, without responding first to the countless children in need of a family. Especially when sometimes these minors live under very difficult circumstances.
1.3.5.1.6.1.8.3.1. Pro: International [adoptions](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/16/world/international-adoption-main-story-decline/index.html) are in decline while the number of orphans grow.
1.3.5.1.6.1.8.3.1.1. Con: This [trend](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/16/world/international-adoption-main-story-decline/index.html) is due to stronger regulations in countries like China or Russia.
1.3.5.1.6.1.8.4. Con: Adoption is often a very difficult and lengthy process which many families are not prepared to go through.
1.3.5.1.6.1.8.4.1. Con: Commercial surrogacy is similarly likely to be a complicated and difficult process, and could come with numerous legal difficulties that adoption does not.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9. Con: Surrogacy is just as legitimate a way to form a family, and should be extended as an option.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.5.1.5.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2. Con: It is illegitimate to form a family through the exploitation of a woman and the commercialisation of her body.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1. Pro: Commercial surrogacy is exploitative of women.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.1.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.2. Pro: Women will only choose to agree to commercial surrogacy if they are financially vulnerable.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.4.4.1.1.2.3.1.2.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.2.2. Pro: [Women](https://theconversation.com/not-for-profit-the-case-against-commercial-surrogacy-18512) who are likely to be surrogates are: 'low-income single mothers, migrants, unemployed women, or mothers unable to work and care for her children at the same time'.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.2.3. Con: Even if the women who choose to be surrogate mothers are financially stretched, this is not a reason to delegitimise a means to earn money.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.2.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.4.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.2.6. Con: For some women, the choice to become a surrogate is not about the money.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.2.6.1. Pro: Some women may choose to be a surrogate to be of service to others that cannot achieve parenthood naturally.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.2.6.2. Pro: Some women may enjoy being pregnant, but are done conceiving their own children.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.2.6.2.1. Pro: [Several](http://www.thelist.com/35900/untold-truth-surrogacy-according-surrogate/) [women](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7851838.stm) [have](http://www.artparenting.com/surrogacy-story.html) opened up online about their positive experiences with surrogacy and their desire to have more pregnancies.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3. Pro: Women who carry children are likely underpaid for their services.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.1. Con: If commercial surrogacy is legalised, then women will be able to compete in an open market and therefore obtain fair recompense for their services.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.1.1. Con: In an open market, there would likely be a large number of poor women willing to engage in commercial surrogacy out of desperation. This could push prices down rather than keeping them competitive.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.2. Con: It is more likely that women will be underpaid in a system without regulation.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: Surrogates in India are underpaid and often [not given access to their surrogacy contracts](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Unregulated-surrogacy-industry-worth-over-2bn-thrives-without-legal-framework/articleshow/21131823.cms). It is impossible for these women to advocate for their own rights.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: A survey of 200 surrogates between 2010 and 2012 [found](http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/09/18/494451674/why-some-of-indias-surrogate-moms-are-full-of-regret) that many weren't paid what they were promised and were deceived about the procedures.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.2.1.2. Con: Surrogate mothers in India used to be paid around $5,000 USD and $7,000 USD, an [affordable](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(12\)61933-3/fulltext) figure for Western couples, yet a very large sum for Indian women who often make $300 USD per year. This money can be really helpful for education, [housing](https://www.academia.edu/235242/_Commercial_Surrogacy_in_India_Manufacturing_a_Perfect_Mother-Worker_2010_Signs_Journal_of_Women_in_Culture_and_Society_Vol_35_No._4), [healthcare](https://www.academia.edu/235240/_Not_an_Angel_Not_a_Whore_Surrogates_as_Dirty_Workers_in_India_2009_Indian_Journal_of_Gender_Studies_Vol._16_No._2_141-173) or debt.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: An expert researcher in India [said](http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/09/18/494451674/why-some-of-indias-surrogate-moms-are-full-of-regret) that payments to surrogates are simply not enough to actually relieve their poverty.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.3. Pro: The cost of human life is unquantifiable. Therefore, the cost of carrying a child cannot be properly compensated for.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.3.1. Con: Doctors, nurses and midwives all work in creating and preserving human life, yet we have found ways to compensate them for it.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.2.1.2.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.5. Con: With commercial surrogacy, women are compensated for their time, effort, and emotional/physical challenges, not just their expenses as with altruistic surrogacy. This can amount to a bigger payment.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.6. Pro: In [America,](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-06/advocacy-group-urges-nt-to-regulate-surrogacy/5653704) the surrogate mother earns approximately $30,000 USD per pregnancy. This would be insufficient to lift the woman out of poverty.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.6.1. Con: The average income of a surrogate for nine-month pregnancy is [higher](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-06/advocacy-group-urges-nt-to-regulate-surrogacy/5653704) than the [median annual income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEPAINUSA672N) in the United States. Given that many surrogates likely work other jobs while pregnant, this would be a significant benefit to the average surrogate.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.6.2. Con: A job does not have to lift someone out of poverty for it to be legally justified.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.4. Con: There are many forms of labour that can be considered exploitative and yet are not illegal.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.4.1. Pro: The demand for work experience is driving many graduates into [unpaid internships](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/01/11/demanding-experience-graduate-employers-fueling-exploitative/), which are highly exploitative and perfectly legal.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.4.2. Pro: [Deliveroo, Amazon and Uber](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/deliveroo-uber-amazon-gig-economy-workers-exploitation-contracts-mps-accuse-exploitative-a7668971.html) are just some of the companies which have been accused of exploiting their casually contracted employees.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.6.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5. Con: Commercial surrogacy is no more exploitative than altruistic surrogacy, where women often feel obliged to volunteer their bodies for family members or close friends. If anything it is superior because it at least compensates them for the process.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.1. Pro: When altruistic surrogacy happens among family members, there is an element of emotional [coercion](https://academic.oup.com/medlaw/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/medlaw/fww045). For example, family members pressuring the potential surrogate to help the intended parents in need.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: A woman in New Jersey said she felt [coerced](http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/12/nj_gay_couple_fight_for_custod.html) into being the surrogate for her gay brother, especially as he provided her with a place to live and a job.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.1.2. Pro: There would be less of a need for people to coerce family members if the option of commercial surrogacy was open to them.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2. Pro: Legalising and regulating commercial surrogacy is preferable to allowing 'altruistic' surrogacy \(i.e. minimal financial support to the surrogate mother and living expenses\), which devalues the surrogate's contribution to the family and society.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.1.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2.2. Pro: In countries where altruistic surrogacy is permitted, legislations are often [ambiguous](http://gdknowledge.co.uk/surrogacy-law-in-the-uk-and-abroad/) and there is very little [control](http://sverigeskvinnolobby.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/POLICY-PAPER-SURROGACY-MOTHERHOOD.pdf) to establish what is altruistic and what is not. For example, in the UK, courts often recognise any [expenses](http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed161592) as “reasonable expenses”, legalising de facto commercial surrogacy.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: [Advertising](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/11583545/How-to-have-a-baby-by-surrogate-in-the-UK.html) to find a surrogate is illegal in the UK, thus making the process extremely complicated.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2.4. Con: 'Altruistic' surrogacy is often done by family members or friends to help someone close to them. They should be able to make that choice if they are willing to do so.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.1.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2.5. Pro: There is a great deal of physical and emotional labour required in carrying a baby to term and giving birth. Given this is a service for others, the women doing this work should be fairly compensated.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2.6. Pro: Ambiguous laws allowing altruistic surrogacy and/or lack of proper regulations to establish a framework that protects everyone’s rights can turn into outlandish and discriminatory situations.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2.6.1. Pro: In the UK, prospective parents had to receive their children in [car parks](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/nhs-surrogate-births-rules-laws-parents-babies-handed-over-car-parks-a7381646.html). As the law establishes a six-week period after the birth before parties can go the courts and transfer parental rights, hospital personnel do not want to be involved in the handover. Despite the Department of Health stating that babies can be given in hospital premises, these situations are still quite common.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2.6.2. Pro: In the [UK](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/6396366/Women-denied-NHS-fertility-treatment-because-they-cannot-carry-child-themselves.html), where altruistic surrogacy is permitted, some public clinics cover the IVF treatments and some do not as the law is ambiguous. If more clear regulations regarding surrogacy were implemented, it is likely part of the costs would be subsidised.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2.6.3. Con: Those discriminatory situations would not take place if surrogacy was fully banned.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2.7. Pro: With altruistic surrogacy, prospective parents can pay [$80,000](http://www.kidspot.com.au/birth/conception/real-life/the-commercial-surrogacy-debate-and-one-familys-surrogacy-story) AUD or [more](https://www.westcoastsurrogacy.com/surrogate-program-for-intended-parents/surrogate-mother-cost) in medical and legal fees, yet no money goes to the surrogate mother to compensate her for her effort.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.6. Con: This process does not have to be exploitative. Having clear regulations and protections in place can allow surrogacy to simply be a job that women can freely sign up to.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.7. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.9.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.5.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.3. Pro: Some couples may not have access to more altruistic forms of surrogacy. Commercial surrogacy enables a broader opportunity to find a willing surrogate.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.3.1. Pro: The [majority](https://surrogate.com/about-surrogacy/types-of-surrogacy/what-is-altruistic-surrogacy/) of altruistic surrogates are already known to the intended parents. Many people do not have a friend or family member willing to go to those lengths for them.
1.3.5.1.6.1.9.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2.2.1.
1.3.5.1.6.1.10. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.2.5.
1.3.5.1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.1.
1.3.5.1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.6.2.
1.3.5.1.6.4. Con: Mitigating the demand is not the same as eliminating it. Even if only a dozen families a year need surrogacy, keeping that market illegal will hurt them and the surrogates involved.
1.3.5.1.6.4.1. Con: The issue is how to categorise this “need”. People may want to have children, yet if they are not able to do it by natural methods, they should opt for any other method that is legal. Their desire to have a family should not prevail over other people’s rights.
1.3.5.1.7. Con: New technologies being [developed](http://wombtransplantuk.org/) could help meet the demand to start a family without the need to use surrogacy. For example, womb [transplants](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/first-u-s-woman-with-uterus-transplant-looks-forward-to-pregnancy/) or other forms of [fertility](http://www.fertilityproregistry.com/article/archive/fertility/alternative-options-to-surrogacy) treatments.
1.3.5.1.7.1. Con: These options are not available for single fathers or male same-sex couples.
1.3.5.1.7.2. Pro: [Sweden](http://www.sou.gov.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SOU-2016_11_webb.pdf) has banned all forms of surrogacy yet is actively researching other possibilities for infertile women such as womb transplants. In 2014 the first child has been born after a uterus [transplantation](http://www.gu.se/english/about_the_university/news-calendar/News_detail/world-s-first-child-born-after-uterus-transplantation.cid1239052).
1.3.5.1.8. Pro: Illegal private surrogacy agreements can leave the individuals involved in a very vulnerable legal state.
1.3.5.1.8.1. Con: Entering an illegal agreement or deal may be legally harmful for those who choose to do so. The consequences of those acts should have been taken into account and should not be a reason to legalise that agreement.
1.3.5.1.8.1.1. Pro: The right to have a family is not so inalienable that we should allow people to have biological children through commercial surrogacy if it causes great harm.
1.3.5.1.8.2. Pro: A UK couple used a [friend](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10679695/DIY-surrogate-pregnancy-deal-ends-in-court-battle.html) as a surrogate with artificial insemination at home. When they divorced, the intended mother had no parental rights nor could adopt the baby. The judge established that the child should “remain a ward of court indefinitely”, granting the woman the care of the child and banning the surrogate from exercising her parental rights without the court permission.
1.3.5.1.8.2.1. Pro: The lawyers that [drafted](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10679695/DIY-surrogate-pregnancy-deal-ends-in-court-battle.html) a private surrogacy contract in the UK a bit before the baby was delivered committed a criminal offence according to the case’s judge.
1.3.5.2. Pro: A market that is not properly regulated is more likely to have loopholes that people can take advantage of.
1.3.5.3. Con: It is arguable that most developed liberal democracies are better equipped to deal with exploitative situations and could, therefore, prevent the occurrence of an underground market.
1.3.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.
1.3.5.3.2. Con: Even if developed countries are able to prevent underground markets in their own countries, they cannot do so for developing countries. When their own citizens are forming part of the demand for illegal surrogacy in those countries, they have a responsibility to act.
1.3.5.3.2.1. Con: Developed countries can do both things: preventing an underground market in their countries, yet also trying to stop their citizens from undergoing surrogacy abroad.
1.3.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: After a report recommending a total ban on surrogacy, the Swedish governmental commission also advocated applying measures to counter commercial surrogacy abroad \([Swedish Government Official Reports, SOU, p. 64](http://www.sou.gov.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SOU-2016_11_webb.pdf)\).
1.3.5.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: The Swedish report recognises that banning surrogacy nationally is incompatible with allowing citizens to circumvent the rules by going abroad and then accepting the consequences of such arrangements [\(SOU, p. 63-65\)](http://www.sou.gov.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SOU-2016_11_webb.pdf).
1.3.5.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: The Swedish report does not propose new regulations to transfer paternal rights after surrogacy abroad, nor does it advocate to change present parenthood rules. Genetic fathers will be recognised under actual laws, yet any other parent will have to resort to “stepchild” adoption [\(SOU, p. 65\)](http://www.sou.gov.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SOU-2016_11_webb.pdf).
1.3.5.4. Con: In most liberal democracies where surrogacy is already forbidden, an underground market seems to not been developed.
1.3.5.4.1. Con: [Fertility experts](https://www.ft.com/content/866643bc-7b19-11e6-ae24-f193b105145e?mhq5j=e3) and [women's groups](https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2015/11/17/indias-surrogacy-industry-needs-regulation-not-a-ban-say-womens-rights-groups/) in India have argued that the ban on surrogacy will push the market underground and leave both parents and surrogates with less protection.
1.3.5.4.2. Pro: Given the high number of people from liberal democracies where surrogacy is forbidden or only altruistic who enter into surrogacy agreements in low-income countries with lax or no regulations, it is likely that an underground market in liberal countries has not developed.
1.3.5.4.2.1. Pro: Presently, many Australians, Europeans and North-Americans seek surrogacy agreements in poorer countries.
1.3.5.4.2.1.1. Pro: Presently [25 per cent](http://www.smh.com.au/national/chief-justice-diana-bryant-confident-commercial-surrogacy-will-be-legalised-in-australia-20150429-1mvzn1.html) of international surrogacy arrangements are entered into by Australians.
1.3.5.4.2.1.2. Pro: In the UK, 2,000 babies are born through surrogacy every year and [95%](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/05/feminist-history-surrogacy-how-much-right-should-pregnancy-give-woman-over-baby) of them are born overseas.
1.3.5.5. Con: The desire to pay surrogates less and get the best deal possible will likely still lead to exploitation and some form of underground market, even if a legal one exists.
1.3.5.5.1. Con: If a black market will exist either way, the best thing to do is to minimise the size of it by legalising commercial surrogacy and regulating at least a large portion of the market.
1.3.5.6. Pro: Some developing countries have banned commercial surrogacy, but this has simply [driven the market underground](http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/2016/11/womb-for-rent-regulating-international-surrogacy-market/), removing regulation and encouraging exploitation.
1.3.5.6.1. Pro: India's ban on surrogacy for gay intended parents first, and for any foreigners later, has made clinics exploit [loopholes](https://qz.com/1109531/surrogate-mothers-at-risk-in-india-after-the-commercial-surrogacy-ban-is-extended/) and move surrogates across international borders, worsening their conditions.
1.3.5.6.1.1. Pro: [Cambodia](https://qz.com/1109531/surrogate-mothers-at-risk-in-india-after-the-commercial-surrogacy-ban-is-extended/) seems to have followed the same path: moving surrogates to Thailand and then Laos to complete the surrogacy process.
1.3.5.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.
1.3.5.6.3. Pro: Thailand's [black market](http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/sbs-journalist-patrick-abboud-investigates-the-dark-side-of-commercial-surrogacy-in-thailand/news-story/07559bbe4543421705d20808354bb144) for surrogacy has boomed since the ban on commercial surrogacy in 2015.
1.3.5.6.4. Pro: China has a ['booming' surrogacy market](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/world/asia/china-experiences-a-booming-black-market-in-child-surrogacy.html), despite the fact that both commercial and altruistic surrogacy are banned there.
1.3.5.6.4.1. Pro: The police rescued dozens of children from a “[baby-factory](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/shocking-pictures-show-chinese-baby-4971128)” in China, where surrogacy is forbidden. The living conditions were unhygienic and unsuitable and most of the babies had sexually transmitted diseases.
1.3.5.6.4.2. Pro: Some surrogacy businesses in China cut the [surrogate](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/world/asia/china-experiences-a-booming-black-market-in-child-surrogacy.html) off from their family during their pregnancy, to ensure they do not try to run away with the baby.
1.3.6. Pro: Legalization is the best option because it gives families who opt for surrogacy the backing of the government. They can therefore avoid the consequences that come with illegal acts.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Imposing punishments such as fines or even jail time - as some [Italian](http://www.thejournal.ie/italy-gay-surrogacy-crackdown-2560415-Jan2016/) politicians have proposed - does not seem an adequate measure for people who only want to have a family and are unable by other means.
1.3.6.2. Pro: French courts previously annulled birth certificates obtained abroad from surrogacy agreements, as French citizens should not be allowed to go abroad to circumvent French laws. However, these [rulings](http://nyujilp.org/the-prohibition-of-surrogate-motherhood-in-france-2/) created very difficult situations for the children \(recognised in one country but not in the other\) and did not help to protect the minor’s interests.
1.3.6.2.1. Con: Denying the nationalisation of children born abroad through surrogacy agreements violates children’s rights and does not have their best interests at heart. This shows that in a globalised world, legalising surrogacy in liberal democracies is the best and easiest path.
1.3.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.8.2.1.
1.3.6.4. Con: Implementing bans on surrogacy could help authorities [prosecute](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/cambodia-surrogacy-australian-charged-a7429856.html) those who exploit women, even more so in poorer countries.
1.3.7. Con: -> See 1.3.6.4.
1.4. Con: Most people in liberal democracies are religious and most religions do not approve of surrogacy.
1.4.1. Pro: Liberal democracies should derive law based on the wishes of their people. If most of the people hold religious objections to commercial surrogacy, then the government should derive laws based on those views.
1.4.2. Con: Governments should be secular and derive law without reference to religious texts or beliefs.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Liberal Democracies should enforce separation of church and state as a matter of principle.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: If the majority of a population is religious, it would be undemocratic for the state to cut out religion entirely.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Without the separation of church and state, the state will likely prioritise one religion over others. This is discriminatory to believers of other religions.
1.4.2.1.3. Pro: Religious doctrine tends to be dogmatic and difficult to change. Liberal democracies should be adaptable and focused on doing what is best for their people, not what a religious text says.
1.4.3. Con: Being religious does not mean that you share all of the opinions of your religion.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Many US believers do not take scriptures literally.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Only [twenty-four percent](http://www.gallup.com/poll/210704/record-few-americans-believe-bible-literal-word-god.aspx) of Americans believe Bible scriptures are the literal word of God.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Many Catholics support [abortion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/07/25/National-Politics/Polling/question_11462.xml?uuid=XUun2vUZEeKB-o6Ds4ZMNg#), or the [death penalty](https://www.ncronline.org/news/politics/pope-francis-takes-dim-view-death-penalty-not-all-catholics-are-convinced), or [same-sex marriage](http://www.prri.org/spotlight/attitudes-on-same-sex-marriage-by-religious-affiliation-and-denominational-family/), all of which are positions opposed by the Catholic Church.
1.4.4. Con: Government policy should enforce the beliefs of the majority of its populace.
1.4.4.1. Pro: In democracies the will of the populace is the least corruptible form of decision making.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: The public is often uninformed on specific policies, and votes on emotion rather than rationality.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Citizens tacitly consent to a ['social contract](http://www.iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/)' whereby they surrender some freedoms in order to produce a government that maximises their welfare. In democracies we do so in the knowledge that the government will maximise the welfare of the majority of its citizens.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: Maximising the welfare of the populace is not the same as following the exact views of the populace.
1.4.4.3. Con: Democracies allow for the will of the majority to restrict the freedom of others.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: If policy only reflects majority interests then there will always be an incentive to ignore minority interests.
1.4.4.3.2. Pro: Not all decisions in a democracy should proceed from an elected mandate; some matters of law and justice should result from strong rules that cannot be overriden.
1.4.4.4. Con: The majority of voters vote selfishly and without knowledge or consideration for what policies are best for society as a whole. Elected governments should disregard their beliefs if it creates poor policy.
1.4.4.5. Con: This represents a case of the [Tyranny of the Majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority): a decision does not become right or wrong just based on numbers.
1.4.4.5.1. Pro: Justifying decisions with the mere dominance of a majority - may it be based on religion, skin color or gender - over a minority is dangerous. History knows plenty of examples for this, from slavery in the United States to the discrimination of LGBT+ people until only recently.
1.4.4.5.2. Con: Utilitarianism justifies the tyranny of the majority. Thus, it is acceptable from a major school of philosophical thought.
1.4.4.5.2.1. Con: Modern political systems - and especially democracies - do not work according to utilitarian principles. The happiness of the many does not justify a violation of rights of the few.
1.4.4.5.2.2. Con: Tyranny of the majority does not necessarily increase utility. The majority may oppress the minority because they believe them to be inferior, but it does not actually improve the majority's lives.
1.4.4.6. Pro: According to a [YouGov](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/dpko1u32b7/tabs_OP_Surrogacy_20151130.pdf) poll from 2015, the majority of Americans support surrogacy, 71% of people approve the practice and only 14% disapprove it.
1.4.4.6.1. Con: International coalitions such as [Stop Surrogacy Now](https://lozierinstitute.org/surrogacy-the-commodification-of-motherhood-and-human-life/) and other numerous [organisations](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/03/left-wing-feminists-conservative-catholics-unite/520968/), as diverse as feminist movements and conservative Catholic institutions, have advocated against surrogacy, especially in Europe.
1.4.4.7. Pro: A [YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/08/08/british-public-legalise-commercial-surrogacies/) poll from 2014 in the UK shows that people are in favour of legalising commercial surrogacy, with 54% of respondents saying it should be legal.
1.4.4.7.1. Con: However, the same poll also shows more people in favour of commercial surrogacy if it is for [straight](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/08/08/british-public-legalise-commercial-surrogacies/) couples \(53%\) and less approval if it is for gay couples \(40%\). If laws were passed following the majority’s view, they would be discriminatory and unfair.
1.4.4.7.2. Con: -> See 1.4.4.6.1.
1.4.5. Pro: Polls indicate that most people in liberal democracies identify as religious.
1.4.5.1. Pro: According to polls, Christianity is the largest religion in the EU, adopted by [72%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Europe#Eurobarometer_poll_2012) of its citizens.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: However, European countries have experienced a [decline](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-33256561) in [church](https://aeon.co/essays/is-migration-making-europe-more-secular) membership and attendance.
1.4.5.1.2. Con: The European Union is officially [secular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_European_Union) and only four countries have state churches: Denmark, Greece, Malta and the UK.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Christianity is adopted by [70%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States) of Americans.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.4.5.2.2. Con: The United States is not a theocracy and its law does not have to follow Christian teachings.
1.4.5.2.2.1. Pro: Christianity also believes that abortion is a sin. Yet, the US law permits abortion.
1.4.5.2.2.1.1. Con: The Federal Government is [attacking](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/types-attacks) the right to have abortions in [many ways](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/federal-and-state-bans-and-restrictions-abortion), often making it all but impossible to end a pregnancy.
1.4.5.2.2.2. Pro: Most laws in the US are not made on the basis of Christian beliefs, but rather what is most appropriate for the overall well-being of its residents.
1.4.5.2.3. Con: The US is also comprised of a lot of people who do not adhere to any [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion_in_the_United_States) and that number is [increasing](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/01/10-facts-about-atheists/).
1.4.5.3. Pro: [78%](http://www.pewforum.org/2014/11/13/religion-in-latin-america/) of people across Latin America identify as Christian.
1.4.5.4. Con: ['No religion'](http://www.news.com.au/national/no-religion-tops-religion-question-in-census/news-story/a3b45e6b2e35df695932a83535078f51) was the top choice in the Australian census for the first time in 2016. This shows a clear decline in religious identity and influence.
1.4.6. Con: Many major creeds have [ambiguous](http://peopleof.oureverydaylife.com/religious-views-surrogacy-9339.html) or positive views about surrogacy, including Protestantism, Judaism and Islam.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Conservative Jewish Rabbis and Reform Jews generally allow or find [surrogacy](http://www.mazornet.com/infertility/surrogacy.htm) a viable practice.
1.4.6.2. Pro: The [Committee](https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/19912000/spitz_surrogate.pdf) on Jewish Law and Standards, representative of the Conservative movement, favours surrogacy as a means to have a family, and advocates for regulations to protect surrogates from abuse and exploitation.
1.4.6.3. Con: Some [orthodox](http://www.mazornet.com/infertility/surrogacy.htm) and conservative [rabbis](http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/jewish-surrogate-motherhood/) do not approve surrogacy as a viable way for Jewish couples to have a family.
1.4.6.4. Con: Many major [denominations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity#Major_denominations) of Christianity do not approve of using surrogacy to start a family.
1.4.6.4.1. Pro: The Southern [Baptist](http://d1nwfrzxhi18dp.cloudfront.net/uploads/resource_library/attachment/file/21/Surrogacy.pdf) convention considers surrogacy, or at least most forms, as “theologically and morally problematic”.
1.4.6.4.2. Pro: The Christian Orthodox Church [opposes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18983734) surrogacy, even describing it as "a [mutiny](https://www.rt.com/politics/russia-church-surrogate-motherhood-885/) against God".
1.4.6.4.3. Pro: The Catholic Church opposes commercial surrogacy as it does not consider it [morally](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19870222_respect-for-human-life_en.html) licit.
1.4.6.4.3.1. Pro: The [Vatican](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19870222_respect-for-human-life_en.html), which also rejects any other form of in vitro fertilisation, considers surrogacy “contrary to the unity of marriage”, against the “the dignity of the procreation of the human person” and “an objective failure to meet the obligations of maternal love”.
1.4.6.5. Con: Some branches of Islam [oppose](http://peopleof.oureverydaylife.com/islam-surrogacy-9541.html) surrogacy.
1.4.6.5.1. Con: However, other scholars and believers [accept](http://www.ilmgate.org/the-islamic-ruling-on-surrogate-motherhood/) it as long as it involves a [married](http://www.beautifulislam.net/family/surrogacy.htm) couple.
1.4.6.6. Pro: The Church of [England](https://www.churchofengland.org/our-views/medical-ethics-health-social-care-policy/hfea.aspx) does not oppose altruistic surrogacy as legislated in the UK.
1.4.6.7. Pro: The Church of [Scotland](http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/23182/863_WEB.pdf) supports surrogacy as a means to have a family.
1.4.7. Pro: Christianity and Islam generally oppose surrogacy.
1.4.7.1. Con: In the Bible, Sarah and Abraham used [surrogacy](https://www.gotquestions.org/surrogate-mother.html).
1.4.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.4.1.
1.4.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.4.2.
1.4.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.5.
1.4.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.4.3.
1.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.6. Pro: Commercial surrogacy makes it possible for some people to have a family.
1.6.1. Pro: People have a right to have children and to pass on their genes to those children if they want to, which commercial surrogacy can allow people to do.
1.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.8.1.1.
1.6.1.2. Pro: While most people already have the ability to do this, it is important to make it as accessible as possible for the greatest number of people.
1.6.1.3. Con: While people have a right to a family, it is not crucial that they have them biologically. Alternatives such as adoption are available in this case.
1.6.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.6.
1.6.1.4. Con: Having children is not a right.
1.6.1.4.1. Pro: [Reproductive rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights) include abortion, contraception, freedom from forced sterilisation and reproductive healthcare as well as education and information: they do not include the right to have children.
1.6.1.4.2. Pro: As parenting can result in harm to others \(in the US, a child is abused or neglected every 36 seconds\), it should be treated as a [privilege](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-carroll/post_3810_b_1829044.html), similarly to other activities such as driving, which requires a license issued by the government .
1.6.1.4.2.1. Con: Parents who form their families through natural means are not required to hold a license. It would be discriminatory to hold only some parents to this requirement.
1.6.1.4.3. Pro: Suggesting that having children is a right commodifies children and treats them as their parent’s property.
1.6.1.4.4. Pro: Children have the right to have at least one adult who takes care of them, but this does not give any adult the right to have children.
1.6.1.4.4.1. Pro: According to the European Convention of Human Rights, the right of children to have a family \(for example, being adopted\) exists, while the right of adults wanting children to adopt does not [\(European Commission, p. 9 and p. 13\)](https://www.google.es/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj5jcSmid7VAhXoIcAKHXXGC0YQFggvMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fe-justice.europa.eu%2FfileDownload.do%3Fid%3D45ac4453-12f2-4165-853d-67ec3cc8c057&usg=AFQjCNFKhOnxWlzYzCRKjQoQ7f8V6e2aug).
1.6.1.4.4.1.1. Con: The right to adoption and the right to have a child through surrogacy are different rights claims.
1.6.1.4.5. Pro: Children are not fundamental to a person's ability to survive and have a good life. Therefore a desire to have children can be described as a want, but not a need.
1.6.1.4.5.1. Con: For some individuals, raising a child is fundamental to a good life.
1.6.1.4.6. Con: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other later directives on [rights](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/rights/) establish that people should be able to decide freely and without interference “on the number and spacing of their children”.
1.6.1.4.6.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.4.1.
1.6.1.4.6.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.8.1.1.
1.6.1.4.6.3. Pro: In order to protect this right, it is necessary to give people as many options as possible to allow them to start a family. Commercial surrogacy can contribute to this.
1.6.1.4.6.4. Con: A narrow reading of this right suggests that this relates to children born through traditional means, rather than surrogacy.
1.6.1.4.6.5. Con: The UN has not called on states to legalise surrogacy, only to [establish clear laws](https://www.google.ee/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0ahUKEwjM-5vo4NvVAhXGDZoKHe6yBnYQFgg6MAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdocstore.ohchr.org%2FSelfServices%2FFilesHandler.ashx%3Fenc%3D6QkG1d%252FPPRiCAqhKb7yhsrHPiif0%252F1kumQo%252BD50%252F9nYuN1Cg%252FtkLKTb9cFHOqpFKoJJGhf3jvUWHX65YO7tpP5Yu2RyPwMxVYxVAQcSu%252B3iqvu9yohGywTGO5sibKpl01vZWtwhv5iQdnbJmFi%252BNIQ%253D%253D&usg=AFQjCNHtfS3NoRTyrCXyWE15u7kTC6Onpw) around it.
1.6.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.9.3.
1.6.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.4.6.
1.6.2. Con: Commercial surrogacy is likely to be very expensive so only rich families will be able to afford it, while poorer families will not be able to do so. This means that there is an inherent social barrier erected between those who can afford surrogacy and those who cannot.
1.6.2.1. Con: Locking everyone out of commercial surrogacy is far more restrictive than allowing it. At least some people can benefit from commercial surrogacy if it is allowed.
1.6.2.2. Con: If commercial surrogacy is allowed, some families will choose it rather than other avenues of starting a family, such as adoption. This will make those avenues more available to families with less money.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.6.2.
1.6.2.3. Con: If surrogacy is legalised, it is more likely that there could be subsidies or insurance to help pay for it.
1.6.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2.6.2.
1.6.2.3.2. Pro: Surrogacy-related insurance is [already available](http://budgeting.thenest.com/insurance-cover-surrogate-pregnancy-32725.html) in the US, where commercial surrogacy is legal in certain states.
1.6.2.4. Pro: The [cost of surrogacy](http://www.sensiblesurrogacy.com/surrogacy-costs/) is $36,900 USD in Georgia and $50,250 USD in South East Asia. In contrast the cost in the United States is $146,500 USD.
1.6.2.5. Con: Other assisted [reproductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology) technologies are also prohibitively [expensive](https://www.forbes.com/sites/learnvest/2014/02/06/the-cost-of-ivf-4-things-i-learned-while-battling-infertility/#7fc0d9e124dd) for poorer families and yet are allowed. Therefore, those are not grounds not to allow commercial surrogacy.
1.6.2.6. Con: Poorer families may not have the resources and income to support a child, through surrogacy or natural conception.
1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.
1.6.4. Pro: Women with lifestyles that depend on them maintaining a specific physique can use surrogates to expand their families.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Models, actors and others who depend on a certain body type or appearance for work may need a surrogate in order to maintain their careers.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: Even in these demanding careers, many women choose and are able to take some time out to have children and return to their chosen fields.
1.6.4.2. Con: They should not put the burden of carrying a child on another women because of reasons of vanity.
1.6.4.3. Pro: Many women wait until later in their career to have a family, which can make natural conception challenging as they get older.
1.6.4.4. Pro: Female athletes, for example, may choose a surrogate so as not to compromise their ability to compete.
1.6.4.5. Con: They are still able to expand their families and maintain their physiques using more altruistic forms of surrogacy.
1.6.4.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.9.3.
1.6.4.6. Con: Governmental agencies in the UK have stressed that surrogacy should only be used when intended mothers are not able to carry a child for medical reasons \([Edelmann, p.129](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247514026_Surrogacy_The_Psychological_Issues)\).
1.6.5. Pro: Commercial surrogacy allows [single men](http://www.parenting.com/fertility/planning/more-single-guys-are-turning-to-surrogacy-to-become-dads) to have children.
1.6.5.1. Con: Single men are increasingly able to adopt children even without a partner, meaning that surrogacy is not the only option.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.1.2.
1.6.6. Pro: Commercial surrogacy gives male same-sex couples the opportunity to have their own children.
1.6.6.1. Pro: It is becoming increasingly difficult for male [same-sex couples](http://www.sensiblesurrogacy.com/gay-surrogacy/) to form a family through surrogacy as many countries with homophobic laws do not allow it. Currently, only the United States offers the procedure with all the legal guarantees.
1.6.6.1.1. Pro: As most liberal democracies recognise same-sex couples, it is likely that if they legalise commercial surrogacy, this method will be available for male same-sex couples to start a family.
1.6.6.1.2. Pro: If commercial surrogacy is more widespread, same-sex couples will have choice about the country in which to enter into a surrogacy agreement.
1.6.7. Pro: Women who are biologically unable to have children or for whom pregnancy is risky will be able to start a family.
1.6.7.1. Pro: Some women are at higher risk of [complications in pregnancy](http://www.webmd.com/baby/managing-a-high-risk-pregnancy#1) due to pre-existing conditions or other risk factors. These women may choose a surrogate to protect their own lives and health while growing their families.
1.6.7.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.
1.6.7.3. Pro: Motherhood is socialised to be an important part of womanhood.
1.6.7.3.1. Pro: Most researchers assert that when infertility is detected in heterosexual couples, [women](https://www.jstor.org/stable/190494?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) are more likely to be distressed and feel more responsible. Additionally, medical procedures put the focus on the woman and assign a [passive](http://paa2010.princeton.edu/papers/100622) role to the man.
1.6.7.4. Pro: Many women would prefer a surrogate to adoption.
1.6.7.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.5.
1.6.7.5. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.7.
1.6.8. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.9.3.
1.6.9. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.7.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.5.3.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.5.1.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.
1.10. Pro: If liberal democracies legalise commercial surrogacy, there will be less need to hire women from poorer countries where rights are more often violated.
1.10.1. Pro: [Studies](https://academic.oup.com/medlaw/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/medlaw/fww045) about cross-border reproduction argue that countries like Australia need to regulate commercial surrogacy to avoid prospective parents going to India or Thailand where transactions are not [monitored](http://www.kidspot.com.au/birth/conception/real-life/the-commercial-surrogacy-debate-and-one-familys-surrogacy-story) and risks of exploitation are greater.
1.10.1.1. Pro: When commercial surrogacy is not legal in the home country of prospective parents, they are likely to get it internationally. In this case, parents often get [information](https://academic.oup.com/medlaw/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/medlaw/fww045) online and through social media, thus bypassing healthcare professionals who could offer better advice and support.
1.10.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.4.2.1.
1.10.2. Pro: If countries that forbid commercial surrogacy rarely [enforce](https://academic.oup.com/medlaw/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/medlaw/fww045) punishable measures against citizens who enter into agreements abroad, grant [parental](http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed115581) rights or facilitate [nationalisations](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/477720/new_1.pdf), they are just being hypocritical in forbidding something in their country but allowing it to happen elsewhere.
1.10.2.1. Pro: While surrogacy remains forbidden, [France's](https://news.vice.com/article/france-to-legally-recognize-surrogate-children-as-french-citizens) highest court has granted legal recognition and citizenship to children born from surrogacy agreements.
1.10.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.
1.10.2.2. Pro: After cases in which intended parents were in a legal [maze](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/German-or-Indian-Surrogate-twins-in-legal-no-mans-land/articleshow/5286325.cms), Germany [recognises](https://www.iflg.net/german-decision-foreign-surrogacy/) parental rights for intended parents of children born abroad through surrogacy.
1.10.2.3. Pro: The [European Court of Human Rights](http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Surrogacy_ENG.pdf) has ruled on several occasions \(regarding French and Belgium cases\) that states should recognise children born to surrogate mother overseas in order to avoid state interference and to guarantee the child’s rights.
1.10.2.3.1. Con: A Spanish gay couple was trapped in [Mexico](https://elpais.com/elpais/2015/02/12/inenglish/1423748151_686685.html?rel=mas) unable to obtain a passport for their children born through surrogacy, due to discrepancies between regional and national Mexican jurisdiction. As Spanish law requires the surrogate to be recognised as the mother, they could not obtain a Spanish passport either.
1.10.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.2.2.1.1.4.3.2.
1.10.2.4. Con: -> See 1.3.5.3.2.1.1.
1.10.2.5. Con: -> See 1.3.6.1.
1.10.3. Pro: In countries where there are no regulations or they are too lax, surrogates can have their rights violated or children can end up being abandoned.
1.10.3.1. Pro: Although studies claim that, at present, transnational surrogacy is indeed [exploitative](https://philpapers.org/rec/KIRTGS-3), it does not need to be. Putting the right measures in place would be better than not regulating it or banning it.
1.10.3.1.1. Con: In countries without a strong democracy, where often the rule of [law](http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/maps/wb_ruleoflaw/) or human [rights](http://reliefweb.int/map/world/world-human-rights-risk-index-2014) are not guaranteed, it is unlikely that legalisation of surrogacy will protect surrogates from abuse and exploitation.
1.10.3.1.2. Pro: Since liberal democracies cannot change the regulations of other countries, the only way to ensure a safe, regulated industry is to do so at home.
1.10.3.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.1.2.
1.10.3.1.3. Con: As [99%](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/) of maternal deaths happen in developing countries and rates are higher for poor women and those living in rural areas, surrogacy in non-developed countries can have higher risks regardless of its conditions.
1.10.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.2.4.
1.10.3.3. Pro: Surrogates in India are sometimes [impregnated or given abortions without their consent](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Unregulated-surrogacy-industry-worth-over-2bn-thrives-without-legal-framework/articleshow/21131823.cms), violating their right to bodily autonomy.
1.10.3.4. Pro: A child born through surrogacy in India in 2012 was abandoned by his parents; his whereabouts are [still unknown](https://scroll.in/pulse/817116/where-is-dev-the-child-born-through-surrogacy-but-left-behind-by-his-parents), showing the lack of accountability in these cases.
1.10.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.2.1.
1.10.4. Con: The view that commercial surrogacy overseas will stop if it is legalised is misguided, as developing countries could undercut the markets in developed nations so they will offer the same service at a lower price.
1.10.4.1. Con: Either due to not being able to enter into a commercial surrogacy agreement \(Europe, Australia\) or looking for a cheaper deal \(US\), many foreigners have travelled to India, Nepal, Thailand or Mexico to hire surrogates, prompting those countries to [ban](https://academic.oup.com/medlaw/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/medlaw/fww045) this service for foreigners.
1.10.4.1.1. Pro: Amid concerns of exploitation and lack of oversight, [Nepal](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/world/asia/nepal-bans-surrogacy-leaving-couples-with-few-low-cost-options.html) banned surrogacy in September 2016.
1.10.4.1.2. Pro: In 2015, the only [Mexican](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/15/mexico-tabasco-state-surrogacy-gay-men-foreign-couples) state legislature that allowed surrogacy \(allegedly non-commercial\) voted to forbid it to gay couples and foreigners.
1.10.4.1.3. Pro: After a case involving a baby with Down's syndrome put [Thailand](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-31546717) in the media spotlight, the country decided to ban commercial surrogacy to foreigners in 2015.
1.10.4.1.4. Pro: [India](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/india-ban-surrogacy-potential-foreign-parents/) has also regulated surrogacy, permitting it only to married Indian infertile couples and not allowing foreigners to hire Indian surrogates.
1.10.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.3.2.1.2.
1.10.4.3. Con: Even if the cost of the surrogacy arrangement itself is lower, the [hidden costs](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/12/the-hidden-costs-of-international-surrogacy/382757/) of international surrogacy \(travel expenses, legal troubles or even fraud\) can put prices at a similar level to domestic prices.
1.10.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.4.
1.10.4.5. Con: Even if the services are cheaper overseas, potential parents may decide to engage a surrogate mother in their home country due to the legal protections that exist for prospective parents in their home country. If so, it is likely they will be willing to pay more for the service.
1.10.4.5.1. Pro: There are inconsistencies between international jurisdictions relating to the registration of surrogate children.
1.10.4.5.1.1. Pro: For example, Professor Millbank [identifies](http://www.abc.net.au/news/factcheck/2014-08-19/rights-of-surrogate-children-born-overseas/5654602) that: "In the absence of Australian parentage the child would, in some circumstances \(such as birth in India\), be both stateless and parentless; in others the child would have the citizenship of the birth country \(United States, Thailand\) but no parents \(California, British Columbia\); or only a mother there \(Thailand\)."
1.10.4.5.2. Pro: The process for obtaining legal recognition for a overseas surrogacy arrangement is complex.
1.10.4.5.2.1. Pro: In Australia, birth certificates issued by other jurisdictions may not be recognised by the [Family Court](http://www.abc.net.au/news/factcheck/2014-08-19/rights-of-surrogate-children-born-overseas/5654602). If so, the child is placed in legal limbo and may not be entitled to the benefits that children born in Australia are given.
1.10.4.5.2.2. Pro: In order to [obtain](http://www.abc.net.au/news/factcheck/2014-08-19/rights-of-surrogate-children-born-overseas/5654602) an Australian passport for a child born in, for example, Thailand, it is necessary to provide a copy of the surrogate agreement and evidence that the child is biologically linked to one of the parents. The Australian embassy will then require a DNA test before the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has discretion as to granting citizenship to the child.
1.10.4.5.2.3. Pro: In the UK, for the baby to be registered as [British](http://www.fishermeredith.co.uk/site/blog/fm-blog/international-surrogacy-and-how-to-bring-baby-back-to-uk) and to acquire a British passport the surrogate mother has to be unmarried and the intended father or mother has to be British and genetically related to the child \(and documented by a DNA test\). If the surrogate mother is married, one of the intended parents has to be British and related to the child.
1.10.4.5.2.3.1. Pro: However, the process is [discretionary](http://www.fishermeredith.co.uk/site/blog/fm-blog/international-surrogacy-and-how-to-bring-baby-back-to-uk), therefore the Home Office may approve it or not.
1.10.4.5.2.3.2. Pro: Registering a British child when the intended parents do not meet the [requirements](http://www.fishermeredith.co.uk/site/blog/fm-blog/international-surrogacy-and-how-to-bring-baby-back-to-uk), that is, when they are not British \(though living the UK\) or are not genetically related to the child \(for example, using traditional surrogacy\) can be really complex. The parents may apply for a visa, for the baby to enter the UK, although if the baby cannot obtain a passport in the birth country, the visa application is not possible.
1.10.4.5.2.4. Con: -> See 1.10.2.2.
1.10.4.5.2.5. Con: -> See 1.10.2.3.
1.10.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.6.
1.10.6. Con: Crime organisations can still prey on vulnerable women and try to [profit from child trafficking](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/shocking-pictures-show-chinese-baby-4971128) within poor countries.
1.10.6.1. Con: As surrogacy is still [banned](http://gbtimes.com/china/china-continue-ban-surrogacy) in China, it is likely that if regulations were put in place, these type of exploitative and abusive situations would not happen.
1.10.6.1.1. Con: However, despite being [banned](http://gbtimes.com/china/china-continue-ban-surrogacy), commercial surrogacy is [booming](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/16/official-ban-is-no-brake-on-chinas-surrogacy-sector.html) in China. If organisations \(criminal or otherwise\) are already taking the risk of using surrogates while it is illegal, it is unlikely that legalising it would stop them from exploiting women.
1.10.6.2. Con: This is far less likely in liberal democracies, where child trafficking is uncommon and surrogacy can be regulated.
1.10.6.2.1. Con: It is still likely in the US, where [1 in 6](http://www.missingkids.org/1in6) child runaways reported are likely due to sex trafficking. Many are from the [most vulnerable and poor](https://www.wearethorn.org/child-trafficking-statistics/) US communities.
1.10.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.10.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.6.4.1.
1.10.7. Con: Commercial surrogacy should be legalised everywhere. Legalisation in developing countries will improve conditions for women in those countries. It does not make sense to only legalise commercial surrogacy in liberal democracies.
1.10.7.1. Con: -> See 1.10.3.1.1.
1.10.7.2. Pro: It also avoids artificially creating a protected marketplace in developed countries. The legality of surrogacy in developed countries will inflate prices in comparison with practices in the developing world. This reduces choice for potential parents who are unable to afford the fees of commercial surrogacy in a liberal democracy.
1.10.7.2.1. Pro: These families will face the difficult decision of choosing to engage a surrogate from a developing nation despite the risks associated with commercial surrogacy such as the legality of the procedure and confidence that the baby will be protected legally once born to return to the country of the prospective parents.
1.11. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.1.9.2.1.5.2.
