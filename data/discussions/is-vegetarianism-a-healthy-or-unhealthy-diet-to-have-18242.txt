Discussion Title: Is Vegetarianism A Healthy or Unhealthy Diet To Have?

1. Vegetarianism is a nutritionally healthy diet.
1.1. Con: [Humans are omnivores](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/12/23/how-humans-evolved-to-be-natural-omnivores/#39f4e83d7af5); we are designed to eat a variety of food types and sources.
1.1.1. Con: We're not necessarily designed to eat both meat and vegetables, we're designed to eat a certain set of nutrients eg. vitamins. This nutrients can be obtained through a variety of means, even excluding meat \(except for Vitamin B12\).
1.1.2. Con: Being capable of eating foods from certain sources does not make those sources essential.
1.1.3. Con: We are not bound to our previous habits, but have the knowledge and technology to change them while remaining healthy.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Humans are constantly evolving; so, too, should our eating patterns.
1.2. Con: Some studies suggest that vegetarians are '[less healthy and have a lower quality of life](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/vegetarians-are-less-healthy-and-have-a-lower-quality-of-life-than-meateaters-scientists-say-9236340.html)' than meat-eaters.
1.3. Pro: According to the American Dietetic Association, [a vegetarian diet meet protein requirements, provide all essential amino-acids, and improve one's health.](https://jandonline.org/article/S0002-8223\(09\)00700-7/fulltext)
1.3.1. Con: Vegetarianism can also come with serious [health risks](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/the-potential-health-risks-of-a-vegetarian-diet.aspx).
1.4. Pro: The British Dietetic Association has stated that: "... it is possible to follow a well-planned, plant-based, vegan-friendly diet that supports healthy living in people of all ages, and during pregnancy and breastfeeding."
1.4.1. Pro: If it is possible to follow a vegan diet healthily - given that it is more restrictive than vegetarianism - it is more than possible to follow a vegetarian diet and be fully healthy.
1.4.2. Pro: Vegetarian diets for [pregnant women](https://www.fitpregnancy.com/nutrition/prenatal-nutrition/vegetarian-pregnancy) are perfectly feasible, assuming a varied diet of "healthy fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts".
1.4.3. Con: Pregnant and breastfeeding women, if vegetarian, need to [supplement heavily](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/vegetarian-and-vegan-mums-to-be/) to get adequate nutrients.
1.4.3.1. Con: All pregnant and breastfeeding women [have to supplement](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/vitamins-minerals-supplements-pregnant/) their diets in some way.
1.5. Pro: Vegetarianism [lowers risk of heart disease](https://jandonline.org/article/S0002-8223\(09\)00700-7/fulltext) by a quarter.
1.5.1. Con: Some types of vegetarian diets can [cause](https://www.nhs.uk/news/food-and-diet/some-types-of-vegetarian-diet-can-raise-heart-disease-risk/) heart disease.
1.5.2. Pro: It may even reduce the heart disease death risk by [up to 40%](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321992.php).
1.6. Con: Vegetarians are more than ten times as likely to be [deficient in the vitamin B12.](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/news/20030618/vegetarian-diet-b12-deficiency)
1.6.1. Pro: A B12 deficiency is a type of [serious aneamia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamin-b12-or-folate-deficiency-anaemia/) that requires medical intervention.
1.6.2. Con: This is not generally an issue for vegetarians as they may consume milk, cheese etc. Vegans generally will drink milk alternative that have been fortified with B12, or they could use nutritional yeast, B12 pills, or consume a fortified cereal.
1.6.2.1. Con: The fact that it needs to be supplemented proves it is not a healthy or balanced diet to have.
1.6.3. Pro: B12 is not found in [any plant-based sources](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/news/20030618/vegetarian-diet-b12-deficiency) other than fortified cereals, meaning it is difficult to access.
1.7. Pro: Meat-eaters are [overall more overweight](https://jandonline.org/article/S0002-8223\(09\)00700-7/fulltext) than vegetarians.
1.7.1. Con: Your dichotomy mixes two groups of meat-eaters: those who care about their diet and those who don't. To be a vegetarian you have to first care about your diet. So the correlation you presented is more likely to be dependent not on vegetarianism, but on healthy lifestyle.
1.7.2. Con: There are many confounding factors, and this is a claim based only on association.
1.7.3. Pro: Vegetarian diets tend to be less calorie-dense than typical omnivorous diets.
1.7.3.1. Con: In ovo-lacto vegetarian diets, meat is often substituted with fat products \(i.e. cheese\) leading to higher calorie intake.
1.8. Con: Meat helps you to increase and maintain muscle mass.
1.8.1. Pro: It also contains creatine, which helps fuel said muscle.
1.8.2. Con: It is possible to be a [vegetarian bodybuilder](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/vegetarian-bodybuilding.html); evidently meat is not the only way to increase and maintain muscle mass.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Indeed, being a vegan bodybuilder \(so even more extreme than vegetarianism\) is [arguably healthier](https://veganproducts.org/vegan-bodybuilding/vegan-vs-meat-eating-bodybuilders/) than being a meat-eating one.
1.8.3. Con: The protein in meat has no special characteristics that make it more effective for building muscle.
