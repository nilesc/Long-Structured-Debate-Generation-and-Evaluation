Discussion Title: Does the Bible allow women to hold the church office of "deacon"?

1. Does the Bible allow women to hold the church office of "deacon"/"deaconess"?
1.1. Con: In [1 Timothy 3:10-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim%203%3A10-11&version=NKJV), verse 10 mentions deacons and then verse 11 says, "Likewise, their wives ...", implying deacons must be men.
1.1.1. Con: Verse 11 just means that the spouse should be on board with the ministry \(although I don’t know that they have to operate exactly as Aquila and Priscilla—Peter was married also\).
1.1.1.1. Con: The Greek word there for “wives” is explicitly female—not a generic “spouse” term.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Greek does have a word for spouse: σύζυγος / σύζηγος \(the first one being, in Latin-ish characters, “sýzygos”\).
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Neither of those spellings seem to exist in the Koine Greek used for the New Testament, therefore it is possible that they did not have this word at the time. Strong’s doesn’t have any words starting in σύζ-.
1.1.1.2. Con: “on board with the ministry”? I don’t see that idea in that verse. If you’re referring to “faithful in all things”, the Greek word for “faithful” seems to mean believing, trustworthy, or truthful; “in all things” seems to mean in total, or completely. So I suppose that phrase’s meaning could include being “on board with the ministry”, but I don’t get the impression that’s what he’s getting at, given the context of the rest of that verse.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The Good News Bible \(which I generally do not recommend\) has an interesting rendering of it: “Their wives also must be of good character and must not gossip; they must be sober and honest in everything.” To me that seems to be a reasonable way to understand the verse.
1.1.1.3. Pro: I just meant that the spouse is not working against Christ.
1.1.2. Con: Women are not specifically excluded here. Also, women were in the group that met to select a replacement apostle for Judas \([link](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+1%3A13-26&version=NIV)\). And in the next chapter, there is nothing to indicate that the men spoke while the women stayed out of the way. In fact, Peter quotes Joel that the men and women would prophesy, saying that's what was happening publicly.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Women are not excluded, they are elevated by Paul as having to be as "saint" as what is asked to deacons.
In the current \(French\) translations, LS or AELF, the term used is "the women" not "their spouse\(s\)", btw so it doesn't seem to apply to only deacon's wife, but to all women.
Said in another way ,deacons have to be as "saint" as a woman should be.
I teach my boys to be as "saint" as a deacon too.[1Tim3, 11 "women" in French](http://www.aelf.org/bible/1Tm/3)
[1Tim3, 11 : compare "women" \(Darby, Segond\) vs "their wives" \(others\)](https://www.enseignemoi.com/bible/1-timothee-3.html)
1.2. Pro: Some versions translate [Romans 16:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+16%3A1&version=NIV) as saying "... our sister Phoebe, a deacon of the church ...", which proves she was authorized to hold that position, under the principle of "approved example".
1.2.1. Con: Most versions translate this verse using "servant" and not "deacon".
1.2.1.1. Con: A deacon is a servant in this context, in that it is an administrative role, not an authoritative role.
1.2.2. Con: Let’s say for now that Paul commended a female “diakonon” in Romans 16:1 so that no interpretation of the root is implied. “diakonon” taken alone does not conclusively imply one or the other specific meaning \(servant or deacon\) – but since 1 Tim. does \(based on the context, of course\), the qualifications there exclude the Rom. 16:1 instance from applying in the same sense.
1.2.2.1. Pro: 1 Tim. 3:8-10,12 gives qualifications for “diakonoi”. If this passage meant general servants, then only married guys with kids could act as a servant in any way. This obviously doesn’t make sense: we know from other passages that all Christians are to serve others \(I’m thinking I don’t have to prove that\). Therefore, these “diakonoi” aren’t just servants in the general sense, and are subject to qualifications that general servants aren’t.
1.2.3. Con: This root word could encapsulate two slightly different meanings, as other Bible words sometimes do \(such as church, or ekklesia, which depending on the context can mean the church universal or a local body\).
1.2.4. Pro: No matter how "diakonon" is translated, referring to her that way may still imply holding a role beyond that of a mere member of said church.
1.2.5. Con: While the Greek form in question in Romans 16:1 is the feminine form of διάκονος, this word can be understood outside of the office of deacon and rather as simply "servant" as it appears in John 2:5 \(servants at a wedding party\); Romans 13:4 \(the government\); 15:8 \(Jesus\); 1 Timothy 4:6 \(Timothy\), and Colossians 1:25 \(Paul\). More evidence is needed to show that Phoebe is commended as the holder of an office.
1.3. Con: [1 Timothy 3:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim%203%3A12&version=NIV;ASV;NASB;NKJV;ESV) is usually translated like, "Let deacons be the husband of one wife ...", which implies that all deacons would have to be men.
1.3.1. Pro: The Greek word here is plural and masculine.
1.3.2. Con: The same word was conjugated as singular and feminine in Romans 16:1.
1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.3.4. Con: It is common to refer to audiences of mixed-gender people as male in non-gender-neutral languages, like Greek -- and even in gender-neutral languages like English.
1.3.4.1. Con: This usage doesn't appear to be one of a mixed-gender audience.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: The Greek word “diakonos” is literally “servant.” Our word “deacon” is a transliteration from the original language, and it seems intellectually dishonest to create a special order in the church by picking and choosing when to translate and when to transliterate.
1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.3.6. Con: Each translation needs to be interpreted within the societal context of when it was translated, since there is not only one single translation but many modern [attempts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_translations). In times of gender neutrality today, this would be gender neutral.
1.3.6.1. Con: That is why, in other claims, the original Greek is discussed -- which should be interpreted within the societal context of when the text was originally written. So if we consider the original Greek, the societal context of modern translations is irrelevant.
1.3.7. Con: This verse was written for a culture that accepted polygamy; therefore, the main point of it is to limit the quantity of spouses, not to specify the gender of a deacon.
1.3.7.1. Con: At least [one person](http://www.scripturessay.com/what-does-husband-of-one-wife-mean-when-applied-to-an-elder-or-a-deacon/) disagrees, saying:
"This is indeed the most literal interpretation of the phrase, but it is very unlikely the proper one considering that polygamy was really not much of a problem in the First Century Church among Christians."
1.3.7.2. Con: That doesn’t explain away what it so plainly says: that deacons are husbands.
1.3.7.2.1. Con: I’ve had that discussion with polygynists. They normally insist that a deacon have at least one wife. It’s an interesting road to go down, but their argument falls flat because of I Timothy 5:9, which is applied to women that the church is caring for.
1.3.7.2.2. Con: On the other side of the argument is the question: Is a man allowed to be a deacon if he does not have kids?
It is easy to prove that God is the one who opens the womb. What about adopted kids though? There is more leeway in this passage than some would give.
1.3.7.2.2.1. Pro: How can one rule or manage his children well if he has none? Methinks it would be unsafe to say that children aren’t a requirement.
1.3.7.2.2.1.1. Pro: Exactly, but this is the same argument that you are using for how he treats his wife.
1.3.7.2.3. Pro: If deacons must have a wife, they cannot be women, as marrying women together wasn't allowed.
1.3.7.3. Pro: Paul’s solution here is quite brilliant. If the men are married to more than one wife, they are not allowed to be leaders in the church.

Let me ask something. Was Paul married? Could he place restrictions on church leadership that he himself did not live up to?
1.3.7.3.1. Pro: Sure, he could, because it wasn’t just him, a mere man, placing the restrictions; it was the Holy Spirit through him.
In John 11:49-52, Caiaphas prophesied that Jesus would die before the Jews had even decided what to do with him. Verse 51 says that prophesy was “not of himself”, or not of his own will or thoughts; its source was divine.
Whether Paul was qualified or not doesn’t pertain to the divine message revealed through him.
1.3.7.3.1.1. Con: Luke called the people who questioned Paul “noble” \(Acts 17:11\). I have yet to find Scriptures to support this treatment of women on a widespread scale.
1.4. Pro: John Calvin believed that the order of Nuns, which the Catholic church had started, was begun by Paul’s orders in [1 Timothy 5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim%205&version=NKJV).
1.4.1. Pro: The women who were taken care of by the church in 1 Timothy 5 were not allowed to sit around idly. They taught as Paul instructed in his epistle to Titus, or visited the sick, or prayed, etc. They worked for their hire.
1.4.1.1. Con: Not just “women” – this passage specifically refers to widows.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Therefore, it would be more accurate to say that they “were not allowed to *have sat* around idly”. Really, all Christians are not supposed to “sit around idly”, present tense – and if a widow is still able to be an active Christian, then by all means, she should do what she can, but that’s not what 1 Tim. 5 is addressing.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Good points, but verse 5 is in the present tense. I’m not saying they have to press beyond what they are able, but these women are still a part of the church. The time that they have from not worrying about survival can be spent on other things.
1.4.1.2. Con: The KJV, MKJV, ASV/RV, and YLT seem to me to have the best translation of verse 9, using “taken into the number” or “enrolled” for Strong’s G2639 \(katalego\), which looks very similar to our word catalogue, possibly indicating the word here might also be translated “catalogued”, which would seem to make sense to me.
In any case, this word does not seem to indicate a hiring or a fulfillment of some office.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: From the context, it seems that this “enrollment” refers to providing for a widow, be it financially from the church treasury, or in some other aid capacity, when she cannot rely on any relatives for the support she might need.
1.4.1.2.2. Con: The elderly have value, but that does not mean that they are allowed to sit around idly. See [I Timothy 5:5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim+5%3A5-6&version=NIV) and [5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim+5%3A17&version=NIV).
1.4.1.2.2.1. Con: Sure, but those verses talk about things all Christians should be doing in that general servant capacity. My point was that the “enrollment” mentioned isn’t talking about any new or currently-ongoing required activity, as would be implied by your usage of the word “hire” to describe widows’ financial support. At the same time, if a widow is still physically able but decides to “sit around idly” once she is “enrolled”, I’d say that might disqualify her from “a reputation of good works”.
1.4.1.3. Con: All the qualifications \(aside from age\) in verses 9-10 specify that they must have been met in the past, i.e. that their being enrolled requires the specified work to already have been done – and not that it will necessarily begin, or be required to continue, upon enrollment.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.1.
1.4.1.4. Con: Women at the time were still treated as second-class citizens, so a widow would not be able to do certain things to provide for herself, even if she were able. Thus, provisions were made for the church to take care of their needs on an ongoing basis.
1.5. Pro: [2 John](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+John+1&version=NKJV) is written to “the elect lady and her children” \(which many think are the Christians who met in her house\).
1.5.1. Con: Women certainly can and do play a meaningful role in spreading the Gospel, although that doesn’t imply that they hold any church office.
1.5.1.1. Pro: The same goes for children \(minors\) and men. Lay people have an important role in spreading Faith, that's exactly the point of Vatican II concile.
They do not take place/role of consecrated people however.
1.5.2. Con: This seems to be a source of contention among scholars: “Elect lady” could mean the obvious, an actual lady, yet some think it may refer to a church itself; “children” has a similar problem: is it literal human offspring, is it the Christians that met in her house, as you say, or is it some other sort of spiritual beneficiaries? And still, what interpretation of “elect” is correct? This may not be concrete proof of anything.
1.6. Pro: [1 Timothy 2:11-12](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Tim%202.11%E2%80%9312) only forbids women from roles of spiritual authority such as elders \(including what we modernly call pastors\). The role of deacon is not an authoritative role, therefore a woman can serve in that position.
1.6.1. Con: The role of deacon WAS not an authoritative role.
Depending on the churchs and periods of time, it may has become an authoritative role.
1.7. Pro: In the history of the church,[there were female deaconess \(Schaff, Bk 3, ChpV, §52\)](http://www.bible.ca/history/philip-schaff/3_ch05.htm), until the Vth century in the West, and the XIIth century in the East, recognized and organized by church councils since the apostolic ages.
1.7.1. Con: The history of the Roman church is not a sanctified source from which we must follow.
1.8. Con: The position in the Bible that is described is the lay position of deaconess. The lay position of deaconess is distinct from the position of ordained deacon.
1.8.1. Pro: The position of a deaconess is simply the honorary result of being the wife of a deacon, and does not confer authority with other deacons.
1.9. Pro: Philip’s daughters prophesied, which implies some authority -- and Paul stayed at his house.
1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.
1.9.2. Con: Philip’s daughters prophesying doesn’t imply any authority of those daughters themselves, but merely the presence of a spiritual gift – though the words spoken from this gift would implicitly have authority, not because of who they are spoken by, but because of the source of the words/thoughts/ideas themselves \(the Holy Spirit\).
1.9.2.1. Pro: Notice in [1 Cor. 14:34-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor+14%3A34-35&version=NKJV) how women are not permitted to speak in the assembly. The [context](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+14&version=NKJV) there is regulation of spiritual gifts – prophesying in particular. So even though their words of prophesy might have some authority, they still can’t speak them in the assembly. They can’t speak, “but should be in submission” – sounds like a lack of sufficient authority to me. These verses, however, only regulate activity in the context of the church setting.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: I Corinthians 14 is an interesting passage concerning women in the church. I have done a lot of reading on it and have yet to find what law prohibited the women from speaking in a public assembly. Hint: it is not Genesis 3.
1.9.2.1.2. Con: The words for “keep silence” are not the same as the ones used in [I Timothy 2:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim+2%3A12&version=NIV). The root word used in I Corinthians 14 is generally translated along the lines of “and they held their peace” \(i.e. [Acts 15:12-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+15%3A12-13&version=NIV)\).

The word for “silence” used in I Timothy 2:12 is also found in places like [II Thessalonians 3:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thess+3%3A11-12&version=NIV), where it is applied to men \(busybody in v. 11 is masculine\).
1.9.2.1.3. Con: [1 Corinthians 11:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11%3A5&version=ESV) is [generally regarded](https://cbmw.org/uncategorized/prophecy-yes-but-teaching-no/) as evidence of women praying and prophesizing in the context of the local church.
1.9.2.2. Con: If women have the ability for the Holy Spirit to speak through them, why doesn’t the Holy Spirit have voice in the common meeting of Christians?
1.10. Pro: Yes, even elder orders is permitted. In the kingdom of God sexism isn't permitted. There is no difference between Jew  or Greek, male or female all are one in the kingdom.
1.11. Pro: Aquila and Priscilla worked as a team to house Christians, to teach them the meaning of prophesy, and more that we have never heard about.
1.11.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.
1.11.2. Con: This is outside the assembly and therefore not pertinent.
1.11.3. Con: There is no statement in Scripture supporting the claim that Priscilla was a deaconess.
1.12. Con: [Genesis 2:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A18&version=ESV): Eve was created to complete Adam, to help him.
