Discussion Title: Should the US stop trying to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear program?

1. The US should not try to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.
1.1. Con: Formally accepting North Korea as a nuclear state would strengthen the North Korean regime.
1.1.1. Pro: Nothing that increases the power or supports the longevity of the North Korean regime is morally justifiable.
1.1.1.1. Pro: The North Korean regime willingly lets its citizens suffer and [starve regularly](http://www.newsweek.com/north-korea-starving-nuclear-missiles-641188).
1.1.1.2. Con: The North Korean government probably feels the same way about the US. If we are to pursue morals at all costs above law then there is no objective framework for settling disputes internationally.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: The North Korean regime is objectively morally worse than the United States. If we can't call torture and death camps evil, the word has no meaning.
1.1.1.3. Con: Condemning and encouraging the world to act absolves you of moral responsibility if the world fails to act while atrocities happen
1.1.2. Con: This would not represent a significant change to the status quo: the North Korean regime is not under any significant threat from outside or inside forces.
1.1.3. Pro: The suffering people of North Korea deserve an international intervention through, or with the help of, the UN. A nuclear-capable dictator would make this intervention impossible.
1.1.3.1. Pro: North Korea continues to commit every human rights violation except apartheid.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: North Korea's oppressive [police state](https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/fs/2017/273647.htm) commits manifold human rights violations every day.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Some of what are called North Korea's abuses of human rights are common practices in other countries, for example [penal labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_labor_in_the_United_States) in the United States.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: This does not excuse North Korea.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: North Korea is a rogue nation, led by psychopathic tyrants that execute people with [mortars](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9630509/North-Korean-army-minister-executed-with-mortar-round.html), imprison people for [three generations](http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/854908/North-Korea-latest-news-children-World-War-3-video-games-Americans), and [abduct foreign citizens](https://qz.com/1078351/dont-forget-about-us-japanese-victims-of-north-koreas-abductions-say/). It is inhabited by a heavily indoctrinated population that is taught [to shoot foreigners while they are still children](http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/854908/North-Korea-latest-news-children-World-War-3-video-games-Americans). Giving them access to nuclear weapons cannot lead to anything good, for anyone.
1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: There are several incosistencies in these statements: psychopathic tyrants wouldn't be able to survive for 60 years while surrounded by American troops and they wouldn't be able to deceive US presidents as they did.
1.1.3.1.2.2. Con: It's obvious that the population is indoctrinated, but how much is this true if people regularly escape from North Korea?
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: In its 2014 report, a UN commission tasked with evaluating the country's human rights record spoke of "systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations " and "crimes against humanity" as essential components of North Korea's political system \([OHCHR, p. 15](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIDPRK/Pages/CommissionInquiryonHRinDPRK.aspx)\).
1.1.4. Pro: The acceptance of nuclear weapons would be a great success for the regime as this would showcase its ability to stand up to much larger countries.
1.2. Pro: Refusing to accept North Korea's nuclear status and condemning it is ineffective and achieves nothing.
1.2.1. Pro: Condemning NK purely for their nuclear program doesn't accomplish anything and distracts from many other harsh political and human rights violations that they should be condemned for.
1.2.1.1. Con: Condemnation of the nuclear program at least directs attention at North Korea. Otherwise, the world would likely ignore the country and its human rights violations as it isn't of much relevance for any major powers.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The human rights violations in Africa, for example, get far less attention--because those countries do not threaten the interests of the powerful nations.
1.2.1.2. Con: We can and should condemn them for all abuses of power.
1.2.2. Pro: Routine condemnation of their nuclear program has proven to be counterproductive and has given North Korea a propaganda tool that the country's government used to further control and oppress its people.
1.2.2.1. Con: The government already controls its people through repression, surveillance, and violence; the issue of propaganda is just symbolic. It is not as if once North Korea can no longer put out propaganda videos, the people will suddenly "wake up" and revolt.
1.2.2.2. Pro: North Korea's entire national identity has revolved around the threat of war with the US, therefore each time we call on NK to end their nuclear program the state run media use this as a rhetorical opportunity to insist the US is trying to weaken the North Korean state.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: It doesn't matter what the US says. The North Korean propaganda arm can and does lie to the populace.
1.2.3. Pro: North Korea cannot be stopped in its development of nuclear weapons anyway.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Despite [strong sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_North_Korea), the country was able to test nuclear weapons several times.
1.2.3.2. Con: There are alternative approaches to stopping North Korea's nuclear program that better serve American interests.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: The US could [incentivize](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/24/obama-response-north-korea-nuclear-tests-deal) North Korea to stop its nuclear programming by ending or down-scaling its military activity at the North Korean border.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: North Korea has offered many times to stop building, but their promises are not credible. The article linked is from 2016, but by the end of [that year](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron#2010) the US secretary of state announced that negotiations were a lost cause because Kim Jong Un believed nuclear weapons were necessary for the survival of the DPRK.
1.2.3.2.1.2. Con: Halting American military activity on the border would include the removal of American troops from South Korea, leaving the South Korean military significantly outnumbered in the event of a North Korean land invasion.
1.2.3.2.1.2.1. Con: There is a difference between stopping military exercises that can be interpreted as aggressive in intent and take place close to North Korea's border on the one hand, and outright withdrawing troops on the other hand.
1.2.3.2.1.3. Pro: North Korea commonly interprets the military exercises by the United States and South Korea close to its borders as hostile in intent and presents its aggressive rhetoric and threats [as a defensive reaction](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/world/asia/north-korea-renews-guam-threat-ahead-of-joint-naval-exercise.html?_r=0).
1.2.3.2.1.4. Pro: Many of the military exercises that involve the US stoke North Korea's worst fears, for example by simulating [decapitation strikes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/11/north-korea-us-south-korea-huge-military-exercise) on the government and its leadership.
1.2.3.2.1.5. Con: Rewarding bad behavior is a perverse incentive. We've seen this pattern before: North Korea extracts concessions, and then cannot be trusted to uphold her end.
1.2.3.2.1.5.1. Con: To the contrary, the staging of massive nuclear exercises close to North Korea's border could be seen as bad behavior that could be stopped as a sign of goodwill without incurring much of a cost.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Direct military action can stop the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: A war with the DPRK now is preferable to a war when the North has a full arsenal of nuclear ICBM's.
1.2.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Among the three options of avoiding war, waging war with terrible consequences and waging war with even more terrible consequences, the preferable one is the first, not the second.
1.2.3.2.2.2. Con: Any military action against the North Korean nuclear weapons program would provoke a large-scale military conflict on the Korean peninsula.
1.2.3.2.2.2.1. Con: If the United States promised nuclear retaliation for any bombardment of Seoul, the North would not fire - even if faced with the destruction of its nuclear program.
1.2.3.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Any attack on nuclear facilities might be interpreted by the North as an all-out war, thus leading to an all-out effort at hitting the enemies South.
1.2.3.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con: If the US clearly informed the North Korean government that we are not interested in regime change and that the bombing and sanctions will stop when KJU agrees to rigorous UN nuclear inspections the risk of misunderstanding US intentions is minimal.
1.2.3.2.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: North Korea has [learned from the fate of the Gaddafi regime](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/north-korea-has-nuclear-weapons-so-it-wont-end-libya-20060) that it should give up its nuclear weapons under no circumstances and not trust any American assurances that are meant to entice it to do so.
1.2.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: There is no military action that does not lead to the loss of life of hundreds of thousands of South Koreans and Americans living in South Korea.
1.2.3.2.2.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.2.2.1.
1.2.3.2.2.2.2.2. Pro: North Korean [artillery](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/07/the-worst-problem-on-earth/528717/) based north of the DMZ could quickly retaliate against Seoul, leading to horrific casualties.
1.2.3.2.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Assuming Kim Jong Un is a rational actor, he will not fire on Seoul if he knows it will lead to his death and to the end of his regime. If he is not a rational actor then war may be inevitable, and it is better to have it now than to have it when he has a full arsenal of nuclear ICBM's.
1.2.3.2.2.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Game theory suggests he must retaliate even to limited attacks somehow, just to prove he's serious. This would quickly escalate, since the same logic applies to the other side.
1.2.3.2.2.3. Con: Direct military action might draw China and Russia into the conflict.
1.2.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: China would most likely come to North Korea's help if the country were attacked based on the [defense treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-North_Korean_Mutual_Aid_and_Cooperation_Friendship_Treaty) between the two countries that has been in place since 1961.
1.2.3.2.2.4. Pro: An airborne surgical strike on known nuclear facilities would cripple or at least seriously hinder North Korea's nuclear program and force them to the negotiating table.
1.2.3.2.2.4.1. Pro: A bombing campaign would apply pressure until the status quo is less agreeable than negotiation. With bombers we could make KJU's status quo extremely difficult. He might be willing to starve his own people, but when the power goes out in his personal chamber, bunker, or lair it is likely that he will become a great deal more pliable.
1.2.3.2.2.4.2. Con: It would be next to impossible to hit all nuclear facilities at once, especially as the country is apparently using [mobile launchers](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-china-truck/north-korea-appeared-to-use-china-truck-in-its-first-claimed-icbm-test-idUSKBN19P1J3) for its ICBMs that could be easily hidden.
1.2.3.2.2.4.2.1. Con: There is no need to hit all targets at once. The attack could go on as long as necessary to eliminate their nuclear program.
1.2.3.2.2.4.2.1.1. Con: This would leave North Korea a chance to strike back or lash out in one last effort. Even if this is far from assured, it is a dangerous possibility and makes any strike highly risky.
1.2.3.2.2.4.2.2. Con: An overwhelming nuclear first strike would take out all their mobile launchers at once with high probability.
1.2.3.2.2.4.2.2.1. Pro: And American antimissile systems could defend against a few survivors.
1.2.3.2.2.4.2.3. Con: North Korea doesn't have a working nuclear ICBM yet. But they will soon if no-one stops them.
1.2.3.2.2.4.2.4. Con: North Korea's small size and lack of [boomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile_submarine) makes an [x-ray pindown strategy](http://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/21/us/pindown-tactic-called-peril-to-tightly-packed-mx-missile.html) viable. This would destroy any North Korean missiles in the boost phase.
1.2.3.2.2.4.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.2.4.2.2.1.
1.2.3.2.2.4.3. Con: North Korea's stated policy is to destroy Seoul in the event of any such attack.
1.2.3.2.2.4.3.1. Con: That Seoul is so vulnerable is entirely due to [South Korean apathy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/08/its-time-to-bomb-north-korea/). Thus, the risk of damage to Seoul should not stop the U.S. from preempting further risks.
1.2.3.2.2.4.3.1.1. Con: South Korea [has been](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/09/why-doesnt-seoul-have-iron-dome/) trying to purchase the Iron Dome system, even though its appropriateness for the Korean situation has been called into question, and working on as well as purchasing alternative but similar technologies.
1.2.3.2.2.4.3.1.2. Con: Parts of the South Korean government have been relocated outside of Seoul to [Sejong City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejong_City).
1.2.3.2.2.4.4. Con: North Korea cannot distinguish a surgical strike from the prelude to a full invasion. Thus Kim would have no choice but to vigorously counterattack any opposing military assets nearby in the hopes of negotiating another ceasefire.
1.2.3.2.2.4.5. Con: It is impossible to predict how North Korea would respond to such an attack.
1.2.3.2.2.4.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.2.2.2.2.1.
1.2.3.2.3. Con: If North Korea invests in a nuclear program, its citizens will starve, which could possibly increase the chances of an uprising in North Korea, as younger generations in the country are becoming disenfranchised with the Kim regime. This could lead to the collapse of North Korea under the Kim Regime.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Multiple agreements aimed at stopping the nuclear program have failed in the past: the [Agreed Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreed_Framework) of 1994, the [Joint Statement of the Six Party Talks](http://www.atomicarchive.com/Reports/Northkorea/JointStatement.shtml) in 2005, and the [Leap Day Agreement](https://thediplomat.com/2016/02/a-great-leap-to-nowhere-remembering-the-us-north-korea-leap-day-deal/) of 2010.
1.2.3.4. Pro: North Korea has nuclear weapons and a pretty good way of delivering them. Iran, on the other hand, did not have nukes, let alone a way to get them to target - so negotiating a deal that prevents Iran from getting a bomb makes sense. The only alternative now is to contain North Korea and work on denying them biological warfare capability.
1.2.3.5. Pro: If North Korea could have been easily stopped in its development of nuclear weapons, the US would have already done so - especially since American territories have been explicitly threatened
1.2.3.5.1. Con: Despite NK's claims, the evidence that they have actual fusion \(hydrogen, thermonuclear\) bombs is insufficient.  The most recent NK self-proclaimed hydrogen bomb test was estimated at 100-200kt.  First hydrogen bomb ever tested, in 1952, was 100 times larger \(Ivy Mike\), at 10 megatons.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Mike)
1.2.3.5.2. Con: Assuming Kim Jong Un is a rational actor, he will not fire on Seoul if he knows it will lead to his death and to the end of his regime. If he is not a rational actor then war may be inevitable, and it is better to have it now than to have it when he has a full arsenal of nuclear ICBM's.
1.2.4. Pro: There is no way to compel North Korea to relinquish nuclear weapons that wouldn't be as destructive as a nuclear war; in fact a nuclear exchange would very likely be a consequence of any attempt to remove NK weapons by force.
1.2.4.1. Con: It is imaginable that there is [a deal](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2017-02-13/trump-and-north-korea) [to be made](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/npqu.12074/full) between the US and North Korea that would trade a security guarantee and/or economic support for a freeze of the nuclear program, which could lead to a dismantling in the long term.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: North Korea cannot be trusted to uphold its agreements about a freeze, short of very intrusive inspections, which it would never agree to. It would just take the concessions and use them to accelerate the weapons program.
1.2.4.2. Con: The problem will only get worse if nothing is done. North Korea continues to produce and proliferate WMDs. The consequences of inaction later may be worse than a localized war now, even a nuclear one.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Sanctions have had no impact on North Korean nuclear aims. The only other avenue is war and that would lead directly to the destruction of Seoul and hundreds of thousands of deaths.
1.2.4.4. Con: Sanctions may slow them down long enough for us to invent a way.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: ICBMs are so last century. North Korea's military, while dangerous, is primitive compared to the United States. The gap may widen if we can maintain sanctions. Better missile and artillery defenses and drone soldiers are already in the works. North Korea cannot win an arms race with no economy, but free-market reforms will gradually undermine the regime. The threat of "star wars" contributed to the downfall of the Soviet Union.
1.2.5. Con: It emphasizes to the international community that the US does not accept it if states \(other than those legitimized by the NPT\) develop or acquire nuclear weapons.
1.2.5.1. Con: American opposition to nuclear weapons is undermined by the fact that other states that have acquired nuclear weapons outside of the NPT - Israel, India and Pakistan - do not face American opposition but rather have close or even friendly relations with the US.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: The United States has adopted a "[don't ask, don't tell](http://www.80bola.com.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/proliferation/israel/Israel%20crosses%20the%20threshold.pdf)" attitude towards Israel's nuclear program - a privilege which no other officially non-nuclear state enjoys.
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: In addition, the American opposition towards nuclear weapons has lost much credibility since the Iraq War of 2003 where non-existent nuclear weapons were [part of the reasons given](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq#Casus_belli_and_rationale) for invading the country.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Most countries would be deterred from developing nuclear weapons by the threat of sanctions, but only if the threat is credible.
1.2.6. Pro: The historical track record provides evidence: no country has ever been pressured through sanctions and hostility into giving up its nuclear program.
1.2.6.1. Pro: When countries gave up their nuclear programs because of external pressure, this pressure came from an ally, for example in the case of [South Korea](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/07/31/why-doesnt-south-korea-have-nuclear-weapons-for-a-time-it-pursued-them/) and [Taiwan](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/chinas-greatest-nightmare-taiwan-armed-nuclear-weapons-19661) and the American pressure to not develop nuclear weapons.
1.2.6.2. Pro: Most countries that abandoned their nuclear programs did so [due to internal reasons](http://www.newsweek.com/nations-gave-nuclear-bombs-78661), for example excessive costs or the lack of a rationale for developing nuclear weapons.
1.2.6.3. Con: But their progress has been slowed, with Iran being a notable example.
1.2.6.4. Con: It may eventually require a war to resolve this, but sanctions have to be tried first.
1.2.7. Pro: The nuclear program is an integral part of North Korea's [identity](http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/en/e/oas/korea-studien/publikationen/Aktuelle-Publikationen/EJB_NKNuclearStateIdentity/index.html) and self-understanding: as a country [under siege](http://journals.rienner.com/doi/abs/10.5555/0258-9184-40.2.223?code=lrpi-site). For this reason, the nuclear program is something that country hardly can or will want to give up.
1.2.8. Pro: By attempting to repress DPRK's nuclear policy it inadvertently shows fear against it and encourages them to continue it.
1.2.8.1. Pro: The USA is the greatest perceived threat to North Korea. Attempting to coerce the North Korean regime into disarming is both confirmation that the nuclear program is a potent deterrent to the USA, and a convincing argument that the USA needs deterring.
1.2.9. Pro: A succesful utilization of force relies to a large extent on the credibility of the coercing party. Thus, for the U.S. to try to force North Korea to abondon its nuclear program, North Korea needs to see a credible threat from the U.S. that a failure to abandon its nuclear program will result in \(military\) force. That seems highly unlikely. The U.S. has nothing to gain by alleviating tensions, whereas North Korea has everything to lose. Their nukes are key to regime survival.
1.3. Con: Accepting North Korea as nuclear state will make the peaceful unification of Korea more difficult.
1.3.1. Con: Reunification is highly unlikely anyway as no international great power has an interest in it.
1.3.1.1. Con: The preferences of the great powers are not the determining factor here. Korean unification will ultimately be a project of the two current governments.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Unification is impossible while Kim is in power.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Unification is not possible under Kim's terms. South Koreans know what wealth and freedom are like. What little knowledge of this leaks into the North is already threatening the regime's legitimacy. Short of a second Holocaust to massacre the South Koreans down to more manageable numbers, assimilating South Korea would poison the Kim regime.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Japan has no interest in Korean reunification as this would result in a large, more powerful Korea. The two countries have had difficult diplomatic relations for decades.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: As much as Japan dislikes South Korea, they like North Korea even less. A unified Korea with a real democracy would be less threatening than the status quo.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: Korean unification would arguably make Korea weaker in the short term as South Korea's economy would have to bear the considerable burden of bringing North Korea up to modern standards. The wealth disparity is even more dramatic than between East and West Germany when they unified.
1.3.1.3. Pro: The United States has little interest in Korean reunification as this would do away with one of the primary justifications for stationing large numbers of American troops in the region, for example to project power against China.
1.3.1.4. Pro: China has little interest in Korea reunification as this would create a state at its borders that might align itself with the US rather than China and host American troops right at China's border.
1.3.1.5. Pro: It was estimated that based on German Reunification that the cost of Korean Reunification and reconstruction of North Korea would cost approximately [US$5 Trillion](http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/01/05/2010010500269.html). The primary roadblock toward Korean Reunification is that NO ONE wants to pay for that amount of money.
1.3.2. Con: Unification with North Korea in the near future is [not favoured](https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/thediplomat_2015-01-29_13-53-09.pdf) by an overwhelming majority of South Koreans.
1.3.3. Pro: South Korea will experience pressure to develop nuclear weapons on its own.
1.3.3.1. Pro: South Korea is commonly described as a [latent nuclear power](http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/south-korea/) that has the technological and industrial basis to develop nuclear weapons within a short time frame. The efforts necessary to do so are thus likely not an obstacle that would dissuade the country from going nuclear.
1.3.3.2. Con: South Korea would remain under America's nuclear umbrella, thus being protected by the prospect of nuclear retaliation even without nuclear weapons of its own.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: South Korea would find the American Nuclear Umbrella less credible if North Korea could hit US cities with ICBMs.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: This is basically the same [reason France acquired the bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_de_dissuasion#History), despite American assurances.
1.3.3.3. Pro: A [solid majority](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/09/13/most-south-koreans-dont-think-the-north-will-start-a-war-but-they-still-want-their-own-nuclear-weapons/) of South Koreans already support the introduction of nuclear weapons to their country. This latent public support might transform into public pressure.
1.3.4. Con: If North Korea's nuclear weapons make the country less anxious about its security, this could lead to inter-Korean progress, for example through negotiations of a peace treaty for the Korean War.
1.3.4.1. Con: As the development of nuclear weapons by North Korea is strongly opposed by numerous other nations, possession of them is unlikely to make North Korea less anxious about its security.
1.3.5. Con: Unification of the Koreas should not be America's intention, seeing as it is up to a democratic unification of the union - not war. And if it were a democratic unification, nuclear weapons wouldn't be an issue at all.
1.3.6. Con: Accepting North Korea as a nuclear state will end the war with South Korea and cause "reunification" because North Korea will then be able to nuke a city or two to force capitulation.
1.3.6.1. Con: It is difficult to imagine North Korea using nuclear weapons as this would certainly invite international retaliation to a degree that would put an end to the North Korean government.
1.3.6.2. Con: It is highly unlikely that North Korea would use nuclear weapons so close to its own territory, especially if it then wants to incorporate the affected areas into a unified Korea.
1.4. Pro: Accepting the nuclear program will allow the US to lift sanctions imposed on North Korea, leading to positive effects.
1.4.1. Pro: Sanctions only strengthen Kim Jong Un's position by making access to consumption goods limited. KJU has control over access and can grant it to those loyal to him.
1.4.1.1. Con: If goods are sufficiently limited, even the elites will feel the pinch.
1.4.2. Con: North Korea violates international law regardless of whether the US accepts or rejects North Korea as a nuclear state. Many sanctions - by the US as well as the international community - would therefore remain in place and few positive effects might materialize.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Many of the American sanctions [refer to](https://www.ncnk.org/sites/default/files/content/resources/publications/HR757_Summary_Final.pdf) North Korea's human rights abuses as well as its money laundering and cyber activities. These sanctions would supposedly remain in place, even if the US accepts the country's nuclear program.
1.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.
1.4.3. Pro: American sanctions target all entities that engage [in the trade of minerals and metals](https://www.ncnk.org/sites/default/files/content/resources/publications/HR757_Summary_Final.pdf) with North Korea. Lifting these sanctions would boost North Korea's trade, which has the potential to further the economic development of the country and the situation of its people.
1.4.4. Pro: The lifting of sanctions could lead to an improvement of relations between the US and North Korea, this providing the potential for a diplomatic opening and further progress.
1.4.4.1. Pro: How serious North Korea takes sanctions imposed by the US and the UN if evident in its descriptions of them as a "[full-scale economic blockade](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/korea-suffer-greatest-pain-sanctions-170912230416433.html)" and a "[declaration of war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/07/north-korea-us-sanctions-declaration-of-war)".
1.4.5. Con: The North Korean regime relies on human rights abuses--strict information control and brutal punishment of any opposition--to remain in power. Any meaningful reforms are poison to the regime. Therefore, no reforms can be expected short of regime change, even if sanctions are lifted.
1.5. Pro: As a sovereign state under international law, North Korea has every right to develop and defend itself with nuclear weapons.
1.5.1. Con: Just because something is legally permissible does not mean that it is the right thing to do and acceptable.
1.5.1.1. Pro: German Nazi regime commited acts that are considered unethical; they did this within their legal framework.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Slavery in America was legal. This is now seen as unethical.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Australian Aboriginal people were legally treated as wildlife. This is now seen as unethical.
1.5.2. Pro: As an individual country the US is in no position to "force" other sovereign states to do anything. International security is the responsibility of international organisations. Unilateral action and interventionism undermine the development of international law
1.5.2.1. Con: If the international community is unwilling to act then it's morally justifiable to step in to prevent atrocities.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: The North Korean nuclear program is not the cause of any atrocities and unlikely to cause any in the future unless North Korea is attacked.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: A credible nuclear capability would give North Korea license to commit more severe atrocities, since no-one would be willing to risk taking a nuclear counterattack to stop them.
1.5.2.2. Con: So far, the United States has pursued its agenda against North Korea through the UN Security Council and largely refrained from unilateral action.
1.5.3. Con: The cruel and tyrannical regime in North Korea should not be recognized as a rightful sovereign state, but as a rogue whose 'right' to nuclear self-defense is thus forfeit.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Since the [Responsibility to Protect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_to_protect) had received the support of the UN General Assembly, the idea that states committing grave human rights violations loose their status as sovereign states with a right to non-interference has been been established in the international community.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: The existence of R2P highlights a double standard in international relations since powerful nations are never held to account on these grounds. If they were then the sovereignty of, for example, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt would have been called in to question at various points.
1.5.3.2. Con: No state acquires a nuclear deterrent by asking for permission. The right to self-defense is never granted but instead enforced through ones' own efforts.
1.5.4. Con: In the case of North Korea, other considerations should outweigh its rights as a sovereign state under national law.
1.5.4.1. Pro: If America were to change its stance regarding North Korea's nuclear program after decades of opposing it, this would set a precedent of America giving in, thus undermining its claim to global leadership.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Respecting North Korea's right to build nuclear weapons would accept a security threat posed to American allies in the region, such as South Korea and Japan. The US would thereby undermine its pledge to the security of these countries.
1.5.5. Pro: North Korea is not a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \(NPT\) which would prohibit it from developing and/or acquiring nuclear weapons.
1.5.5.1. Con: North Korea initially signed the treaty and claimed to withdraw in 2003, yet it is disputed whether that withdrawal was [legal](https://www.ipinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pdfs_koreachapt2.pdf) and thus [effective](https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/10/issue/27/international-law-and-north-korean-nuclear-testing#_edn8).
1.5.5.1.1. Con: Article X of the NPT has a mechanism for withdrawal if states can show that events "have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country" and take into account the 3 month notice period. The terms have [no objective requirement or burden of proof](https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/8/issue/2/north-koreas-withdrawal-nuclear-nonproliferation-treaty) in stating the reasons for withdrawal - this is left up to individual states. Furthermore, the notice period is not obligatory.
1.5.5.1.2. Pro: The International Atomic Energy Agency, which oversees the implementation of the NPT, [still lists](http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/npt) North Korea's status as "Accession" which implies that the treaty's legal obligations apply to the country.
1.5.6. Con: Under [social contract theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract), the state derives its authority from the consent of the people. Without this authority the regime is illegitimate and ought to be replaced.
1.5.7. Con: Given its breach of rules of the international system, North Korea does not deserve that system's protections.
1.5.7.1. Pro: In [Resolution 1718](https://undocs.org/S/RES/1718\(2006\)) from 2006, the UN Security Council decided that North Korea "shall abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner" and "suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile programme".
1.5.7.1.1. Pro: The ongoing validity of Resolution 1718 has since then continuously be emphasized by the Security Council through references to the resolution's violation by North Korea, for example in resolution [1874](https://www.un.org/press/en/2009/sc9679.doc.htm), [2087](https://www.un.org/press/en/2013/sc10891.doc.htm), [2094](https://www.un.org/press/en/2013/sc10934.doc.htm), [2270](https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12267.doc.htm), [2321](https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12603.doc.htm), [2375](https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sc12983.doc.htm) and - as of 2017 - [2371](https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sc12945.doc.htm).
1.5.7.2. Pro: North Korea is [violating sanctions](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/09/07/u-n-report-sanctions-arent-stopping-north-koreas-nuclear-program/) put on it by the UN Security Council.
1.5.7.3. Pro: North Korea is in violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty \(NPT\).
1.5.7.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.
1.5.7.4. Con: This would be an arbitrary measure; North Korea would be singled out. Many nations breach international law to some degree, yet they are not denied the protections of the international system.
1.5.7.4.1. Con: North Korea is not the only nation under international sanctions.
1.6. Pro: Accepting North Korea as a nuclear power opens the doors for possible international regulation and transparency.
1.6.1. Con: There is little reason to assume that North Korea would become more transparent about its nuclear program just because other states do not actively oppose it anymore.
1.6.2. Con: North Korea would be even less likely to accept international regulation and provide more transparency if it was able to use nuclear threat to stop such measures.
1.7. Con: No state or organisation should have the power to trigger global extinction events as directly as nuclear weapons can.
1.7.1. Pro: The annihilation of human life is something worth striving to avoid.
1.7.2. Pro: Historically and up until present day nation states have often acted unethically and against the interest of their constituents.
1.7.3. Con: Powerful weapons are a necessary evil.
1.7.4. Con: It’s hypocritical for the U.S. to denounce another nation for possessing or developing nuclear weapons while maintaining the second largest nuclear arsenal on earth.
1.7.4.1. Con: America criticizes North Korea chiefly because the country is developing nuclear weapons outside of the NPT. Countries that are allowed to do so by the NPT face no American opposition.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.7.4.2. Con: This inequality has been legitimized by and widely accepted in international law, chiefly through the NPT: whereas America and four other nations are allowed to posses nuclear weapons, other countries forgo this right.
1.7.4.2.1. Con: The legitimacy of the NPT is undermined as countries like India, Pakistan and Israel face no backlash for their nuclear programs whereas North Korea does.
1.7.4.2.1.1. Con: India, Pakistan, and Israel have not shown the disregard for international norms with respect to proliferation that the DPRK has.
1.7.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Pakistan has a track record as a nuclear proliferator. [Abdul Qadeer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Qadeer_Khan) and his network proliferated nuclear technology to Libya, Iran, and yes, North Korea.
1.7.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: India was granted a waiver at the Nuclear Suppliers Group, allowing the civilian transfer of nuclear material, despite not joining the NPT, because of her clean track record of non-proliferation and the legitimate need of her large population for carbon-free electricity.
1.7.4.2.1.1.3. Con: Given Pakistan's internal instability and history with Islamic terrorists, she cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons either.
1.7.4.2.1.1.3.1. Con: As bad as Pakistan may have been, they are technically an American ally and amenable to negotiation. North Korea has repeatedly declared itself to be a mortal enemy of the United States, and would be a far greater risk.
1.7.4.2.1.1.4. Pro: Israel is a very close ally of the United States, with a track record of remarkable restraint despite her considerable proven military prowess and being surrounded by enemies. Thus, the U.S. has little reason to fear Israeli nukes.
1.7.4.2.1.2. Con: India, Israel, and Pakistan never joined the NPT, unlike North Korea.
1.7.4.2.1.3. Con: Israel does not officially admit to possessing nuclear weapons.
1.7.4.2.1.3.1. Con: This can be considered an open secret after [the confession of the nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordechai_Vanunu). Israel is likely to have at least 100 plutonium warheads.
1.7.4.2.1.4. Con: As a democracy with an [official no-first-use policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#India's_no-first-use_policy), India is unlikely to ever use nuclear weapons first \(except perhaps accidentally against Pakistan\).
1.7.4.2.1.5. Con: Israel and Pakistan are still banned from trading civilian nuclear materials. That's some backlash at least. India has an exemption due to a legitimate need for nuclear power and a clean track record.
1.7.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.5.5.
1.7.4.2.3. Con: The NPT also stipulates that existing nuclear states are to reduce their nuclear arms. So far, America \(and Russia\) retain far more weapons \(thousands\) than realistically required \(~300\) to deter any attack.
1.7.4.3. Con: The U.S. has institutions more trustworthy than North Korea's for using weapons responsibly, so it's not hypocritical.
1.7.4.3.1. Con: The erratic behaviour of the U.S.'s current president, Donald Trump, cannot be called responsible, and he has the power to start a nuclear war with North Korea.
1.7.4.3.1.1. Con: Donald Trump is an outlier. Most American presidents have seemed more responsible. And unlike Kim, the people can refuse to reelect him.
1.7.4.3.1.2. Con: While the president has the sole authority as commander-in-chief for America's nuclear weapons, Congress could act to limit that authority. Kim has no such checks on his power.
1.7.4.3.2. Pro: The American military has a culture of refusing to obey unlawful orders. North Korea, on the other hand, has been ruled by evil dictators since its inception and a military culture of absolute obedience to the Supreme Leader, enforced via the threat of inhumane punishment.
1.7.4.3.3. Con: The US is the only country ever to drop nuclear weapons on a city, which it did twice during WWII. Though this was long ago it undermines the claim that the US is more capable than other countries of refraining from using nuclear weapons.
1.7.4.4. Pro: The U.S. shouldn't try to force any nation to do anything, not least something it is not prepared to do as a nation itself. This would be global bullying, regardless of which nation it is leaning on.
1.7.4.4.1. Con: The US tried isolationism historically and it didn't work long term. The world won't just leave us alone. Nuclear ICBMs are a global threat.
1.7.4.4.2. Con: North Korea is the bully here, as evidenced by how it treats its own population and flagrantly violates international law. It is a rogue state.
1.7.5. Con: Nuclear weapons, while powerful, [cannot cause](http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/82jpr.html) an "extinction level" event, even if used by the thousands.
1.7.5.1. Con: The author argues that extinction is unlikely and that nuclear war, even with its long-term consequences taken into account, would kill "only" hundreds of millions of people. While this may not be extinction, it is certainly bad enough to be highly critical of nuclear weapons and their proliferation.
1.7.5.2. Pro: In 1982, Professor Brian Martin argued that even the explosion of all nuclear weapons in existence at the time would only kill [between 400 and 450 million people](http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/82jpr.html).
1.7.5.3. Pro: We tend to think of nuclear war as an extinction level event because most deaths caused by it would probably be based in the West. However, places like New Zealand, and large parts of Asia and Africa would likely not be directly affected.
1.7.5.4. Con: When an argument about the current capacities of nuclear weapons is made on the basis of research dating from the situation in 1982, it is not nearly as applicable now as it was 36 years ago.
1.7.5.4.1. Con: Today's nuclear capabilities are not significantly different in terms of their destructiveness from those in 1982.
1.7.5.4.1.1. Pro: America's primary nuclear bomb - [the B61](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B61_nuclear_bomb#Mods) - has been in development since the 1960s. While it has undergone multiple revisions, the bomb's yield has not increased since then.
1.7.5.4.1.2. Pro: America's most powerful nuclear bomb - [the B83](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B83_nuclear_bomb) - was developed in the 1970s and came into force in 1983.
1.7.5.4.2. Pro: The technology to deliver nuclear weapons and employ nuclear explosions is continuously evolving as illustrated by Russia ambitions to develop [new ICBMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-28_Sarmat) and to the technology necessary to cause [nuclear tsunamis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status-6_Oceanic_Multipurpose_System).
1.7.5.4.3. Pro: The understanding of the secondary effects of nuclear detonation or leakage has improved greatly since 1982, especially since the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. New insights should yield much more accurate insight than one could have hoped for in 1982.
1.7.5.4.4. Pro: The global stockpile of nuclear warheads has decreased significantly since the 1980s and today stands at [about a quarter](https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/) of the number back then.
1.7.5.5. Con: A [study](http://www.ippnw.org/nuclear-famine.html) from the IPPNW \(International Physicians For The Prevention of Nuclear War\) concluded that upwards of 2 billion people would die from starvation alone as a result of nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan. That would involve approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized weapons. [America's submarine force](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-russia-china-fear-americas-ohio-class-submarines-19120) has over 1,000 warheads ready to launch, at all times. A single warhead's yield would be either 100 or 475 kilotons. Hiroshima's yield was 16 kilotons.
1.7.5.6. Con: [Cobalt-salted nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_bomb) could render large areas uninhabitable for decades due to persistent ionizing radiation. It would take only 1 gram of Co-60 per square kilometer to kill all humans.
1.7.5.6.1. Pro: A single doomsday weapon would need only about 510 tons of cobalt to render the entire planet uninhabitable, thus causing human extinction.
1.7.5.6.1.1. Con: This wouldn't work in practice, since the rate of transmutation from the normal cobalt-59 isotope to radioactive cobalt-60 is far below 100% due to insufficient neutron flux, even in the presence of a nuclear explosion.
1.7.5.6.2. Con: Fallout doesn't get distributed that evenly. Some areas may remain habitable enough to preserve mankind.
1.7.5.7. Con: Thermonuclear weapons can be made arbitrarily large. Of course, really big ones won't fit on a missile, but that's not required for deterrence if the bomb can be set off in your home country on launch detection and still destroy all your neighbors. A three-stage thermonuclear device would have explosive force on the order of gigatons.
1.7.5.7.1. Pro: A single 10-gigaton bomb near the border would [destroy all of Korea](https://www.rbth.com/opinion/2016/01/05/nuclear-overkill-the-quest-for-the-10-gigaton-bomb_556351).
1.7.6. Con: But states do have that power so it's unreasonable to unilaterally disarm for anyone. Those who have them always will. Given that they exist, a civilisation is foolish not to have them.
1.7.6.1. Con: Even highly sophisticated systems of command and control over nuclear weapons are subject to human error. The risk of accidental use or loss of nuclear weapons makes it foolish to possess them compared to the marginal benefit of nuclear weapons over conventional weapons.
1.8. Con: Accepting North Korea as a nuclear power would weaken global nuclear non-proliferation efforts.
1.8.1. Pro: North Korea is known to proliferate nuclear technology to bolster its economy. The potential nexus between terrorist organizations and rogue states like North Korea is too dangerous to be allowed to exist.
1.8.1.1. Con: It is unlikely that North Korea would give or sell nuclear technology to terrorists as this would possibly invite retaliation from other states for actions not under North Korea's control anymore.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Given they did not fear the backlash from selling to states, they may take the risk of selling to terrorists.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: North Korea has previously sold missile technology to dangerous states that were under UN sanctions, for example Iran \([FAS, p. 16](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R41259.pdf)\). It would presumably attempt to do the same with its nuclear technology for monetary gain.
1.8.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Accepting them as a nuclear power would allow for easier monitoring and reduced sanctions would provide less of an economic incentive to sell nuclear secrets. They have the technology anyway, the only question is how to limit its proliferation.
1.8.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: DPRK has given no indication that they would submit to any monitoring regime upon completion of its nuclear ambitions.
1.8.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The international community has not signaled a willingness to lift sanctions once DPRK achieves its nuclear ambitions.
1.8.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Given DPRK's history of proliferation, it is unlikely that enough pressure could be mounted to stop them from selling nuclear technology in the future, when the international community is in a position of less leverage.
1.8.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: The leverage that the international community can bring to bear against the DPRK decreases when they have a full arsenal of nuclear ICBM's.
1.8.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: According to [a 2017 report](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-kirk-iran-north-korea-0829-story.html), Iran is already working with North Korea to develop nuclear weapons so that it can skirt their nuclear development ban. Iran intends to copy the DPRK's technology so that they can build nuclear weapons faster than the international community can react.
1.8.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Any support for the Iranian missile program is in violation of [UN Sanction 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1929) which bans the country from activities related to missiles that can carry nuclear warheads, and other countries from supporting these efforts.
1.8.1.1.2. Con: Not "hand", "sell". Given North Korea's weak economy, money might be sufficient motivation despite the risks.
1.8.1.1.3. Con: Given their nuclear deterrent and already crushing sanctions, there could be no retaliation.
1.8.1.2. Con: It's unlikely the DPRK would be willing to take a step like openly supporting terrorists, when similar actions taken by other states in the past has been seen and accepted by the UN as justification for war from the US.
1.8.1.2.1. Con: Who said "openly"? That they can threaten us and maintain plausible deniability is precisely what makes North Korea undeterrable.
1.8.2. Con: The de-facto acceptance of India, Pakistan and Israel as nuclear powers outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty has not led to an inflationary spread of nuclear weapons.
1.8.2.1. Con: Yet the risks associated with nuclear weapons have increased through his proliferation. Especially Pakistan has stoked worries that its nuclear weapons may be prone to theft or misuse due to security failures and corruption \([Belfer Center, p. 47f.](https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/PreventingNuclearTerrorism-Web.pdf)\).
1.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.7.4.2.1.1.
1.8.2.3. Con: Using examples of nuclear proliferation to countries like Pakistan, India and Israel to argue that nuclear proliferation is not a realistic prospect is contradictory.
1.8.2.4. Con: Russia got nukes. China borders Russia. China got nukes. India borders China. Pakistan borders India. Every step was controversial. And now Iran borders Pakistan and Iran wants nukes. How long can we hold the line there? This is exactly the kind of domino effect the NPT was designed to avert. Citing the history of a domino effect as justification for a domino effect not happening is a contradiction.
1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.1.1.1.
1.8.4. Con: The US can still emphasize that it does not accept North Korea as a nuclear power voluntarily but for a lack of better alternatives.
1.8.5. Con: The proliferation of nuclear weapons is not necessarily a problem and non-proliferation not a goal to value above other considerations.
1.8.5.1. Pro: Nuclear weapons can make the escalation of conflicts less likely due to the potentially devastating consequences and induce a [nuclear peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_peace).
1.8.5.1.1. Con: Only so far. There have been several close calls made public. Without reforms, accidental nuclear war may be only a matter of time. Every additional nuclear state only increases this risk. This is the rationale for the NPT.
1.8.5.1.2. Pro: Nuclear deterrence is often cited as the reason there have been no global scale wars since the end of World War 2.
1.8.5.1.3. Con: A peace based on mutually assured destruction will breed perpetual fear and terror among all countries involved and those adjacent to them.
1.8.5.1.3.1. Pro: Children growing up with the threat of annihilation during the Cold War had extremely [high rates of anxiety](https://www.thecut.com/article/how-the-threat-of-nuclear-war-shapes-kids-psyches.html).
1.8.5.1.3.1.1. Con: Russia still has enough nuclear weapons to annihilate the United States, but we don't have such high anxiety now. Maybe we got used to it.
1.8.5.1.3.2. Pro: Studies found that the [most vulnerable members](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2327576/) of society such as children, unemployed or those responsible for caring for others are especially susceptible to negative effects of constantly being exposed to the threat of annihilation.
1.8.5.1.4. Con: A peace enforced by the threat of assured mutual annihilation is not desirable.
1.8.5.2. Con: -> See 1.8.5.1.1.
1.8.6. Con: The problem with the nuclear non-proliferation effort is not the ambitions of countries like North Korea, but the hypocrisy of the current nuclear powers in refusing to take the first steps towards removing nuclear weapons.
1.8.6.1. Con: -> See 1.7.4.2.
1.8.7. Pro: Other countries, in particular Iran, can expect to be accepted as nuclear powers if they only endure long enough.
1.8.7.1. Con: North Korea would be accepted as a nuclear power after and because it had acquired nuclear weapons. Iran could still be prevented from reaching this point.
1.8.7.2. Con: Acceptance isn't just based on having. A lot of what is accepted from North Korea will depend on their seriousness about all of this and their willingness to play along. Iran doesn't even have yet so non-proliferation applies.
1.8.8. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.
1.8.9. Pro: Given her proximity and dark history with Korea, Japan will experience pressure to develop nuclear weapons of her own.
1.8.9.1. Con: Given its unique history as the only country that both was [hit by a nuclear bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki) \(twice\) during World War II and experienced one of the world's worst disasters involving[civilian nuclear energy in 2011](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8953574/Japan-earthquake-tsunami-and-Fukushima-nuclear-disaster-2011-review.html), Japan has an especially strong [anti-nuclear movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nuclear_power_movement_in_Japan) that is likely to vigorously oppose and likely prevent such a move.
1.8.10. Pro: With the weakening of the American alliance in the east Pacific, Taiwan will experience pressure to develop nuclear weapons of her own. Taiwan [is close to nuclear capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#Nuclear_weapons) and has only held off until now because of the American nuclear umbrella.
1.8.11. Con: The proliferation has already happened. North Korea has nuclear weapons and delivery systems. Acceptance of this fact can normalize relations and allow for inspections under the auspices of the IAEA or another body. Eventual goal to wind down as part of global effort.
1.9. Con: A nuclear armed North Korea poses a significant security threat to other states around the world.
1.9.1. Pro: Accepting North Korea as a nuclear power would destabilize East Asia.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Facing an accepted nuclear North Korea, Japan would likely strengthen its defensive capabilities.
1.9.1.1.1. Pro: This would most likely have negative reverberations throughout the region as South Korea and China see Japan in a very critical light.
1.9.1.1.1.1. Pro: [China](http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2014/07/27/china-responds-to-japans-constitutional-reinterpretation/) and [South Korea](https://www.cfr.org/blog/korean-view-japans-constitutional-revision-debate) already perceive the Japanese government's plans to revise its constitution and weaken its pacifistic requirements as highly problematic.
1.9.1.1.2. Pro: In the face of a nuclear North Korea, the ambition of conservative forces [to change Japan's constitution](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/world/asia/japan-constitution-shinzo-abe-military.html) and enable the country to engage militarily would receive a boost.
1.9.1.1.2.1. Pro: Japanese public opinion is currently [split in half](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/04/30/national/japanese-divided-revising-article-9-amid-north-korea-threats-poll/) regarding constitutional revision. Seeing North Korea being accepted as a nuclear power might easily tip the balance and give politicians a mandate for revision.
1.9.1.1.3. Pro: Japan might further accelerate the increase of its defense spending, especially as recent rises were [explicitly linked](https://thediplomat.com/2017/08/whats-in-japans-record-2018-defense-budget-request/) to the threat posed by North Korea.
1.9.1.1.4. Con: This would be in America's interest as Japan has been de-facto freeriding on American security assurances for decades.
1.9.1.2. Pro: North Korea would be:
- If considered stable and loyal to its allies, a nuclear proxy for China and Russia to threat US interests.
- If considered unstable and uncontrollable, a threat for every country, directly or indirectly.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: China and Russia have their own nuclear weapons. China borders North Korea so it is unclear what use it would be as geographical proxy.
1.9.1.3. Con: If the acceptance of North Korea's nuclear status would stop the country from threatening its neighbors and the United States, this might actually stabilize the region.
1.9.1.3.1. Pro: The acceptance of China as a nuclear power enhanced regional stability by making China feel more secure against the US and its allies. Similarly, North Korea may feel more secure if its status as nuclear weapons state is accepted. If North Korea feels more secure, it may be less willing to engage in threatening actions, which enhances overall regional stability.
1.9.1.4. Pro: North Korea would become more aggressive.
1.9.1.4.1. Pro: North Korea would not fear retaliatory strikes when acting hawkish towards regional US allies, such as sinking South Korean vessels like the [Cheonan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROKS_Cheonan_sinking).
1.9.1.4.1.1. Con: The American troops stationed in South Korea ensure that any aggression against the latter also involves the US into a conflict.
1.9.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The military base in Itaewon is scheduled to move in the upcoming years.
1.9.1.4.1.2. Con: The US holds operational control over South Korean forces. This automatically involves the US in any conflict on the peninsular.
1.9.1.4.1.2.1. Con: Operational control transfer has been [delayed](https://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/conditions-dictate-delay-in-south-korea-opcon-transfer-1.310584) repeatedly in the past.
1.9.1.5. Con: Accepting North Korea as a nuclear power would increase the region's stability as the spread of nuclear weapons makes conflicts too risky to break out and induces a [nuclear peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_peace).
1.9.1.5.1. Con: Nuclear weapons may prevent all-out war yet promote conflict on a lower level. For example, they [have been described](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/016228805775124570) as a facilitator of non-nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan as both sides can be reasonably sure that their provocations and responses won't escalate into a larger war.
1.9.1.5.2. Pro: The fear of conflict escalating into an all-out nuclear war is seen as the reason why Pakistan and India \(both nuclear-armed states\) have been living in "[an uneasy calm](https://theconversation.com/how-the-bomb-has-kept-the-peace-between-india-and-pakistan-45839)" for decades.
1.9.1.5.3. Con: While a nuclear peace may be stable on the face of it, the stakes are high and small mistakes can have grave consequences. This is illustrated by the alleged [near-outbreak of nuclear war](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41314948) between the US and the Soviet Union in 1983 because of a computer error.
1.9.1.6. Con: Concern on the grounds of destabilisation is hypocrisy. Most of the major actors on the issue are or have been involved in actions that caused destabilisation in Northeast Asia.
1.9.1.6.1. Pro: Continued territorial claims by numerous actors, but particularly China, over the '[first island chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_island_chain)' and the establishment of military bases on those islands by others \(particularly the US\) threatens peace in the region.
1.9.1.6.2. Pro: The increased militarisation and establishment of an [Air Defence Identification Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Defense_Identification_Zone_\(East_China_Sea\)) by China over part of the East China Sea and the continual deliberate measures taken by the [US](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-defence/china-says-u-s-should-respect-chinas-air-defense-zone-idUSKBN16U0SB), [Japan, and South Korea](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25133957) to defy it can only lead to increased hostility and tension in the region.
1.9.1.6.3. Pro: The increased drive for industrialisation in China [puts at risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3888022/) food security for the region's biggest population as more than 40% of the land  is now inarable as a result of pollution and top soil erosion.
1.9.1.6.4. Pro: The [provocative US naval patrol missions](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anderscorr/2017/07/03/chinese-warships-shadowing-u-s-navy-new-normal-in-south-china-sea/&refURL=https://www.google.co.uk/&referrer=https://www.google.co.uk/) in and around the China Sea and the equally provocative actions of China to intercept or surface submarines in the middle of those fleets are dangerous. Such grandstanding by both sides can only lead to heightened tensions and instability in the region.
1.9.1.6.5. Pro: Japan invaded China in the 1930s and then most of South East Asia in the 1940s. As part of it's loss after the war their constitution only allowed for self-defence forces. In recent years however, [remilitarisation has become the norm](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/world/asia/japan-constitution-shinzo-abe-military.html). This can only heighten tensions and instability in the region.
1.9.1.6.6. Pro: Russia and Japan's ongoing territory dispute over the Kuril islands has meant that [as yet no peace treaty has been signed](http://natoassociation.ca/the-peace-treaty-that-never-was-russia-japan-and-the-kuril-islands/) between the two to end world war II.
1.9.1.6.7. Con: [Tu quoque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque). Let's not make it worse.
1.9.1.7. Pro: To effectively deter North Korea, the US needs to send more military assets to East Asia. This strains the relations between the US and China.
1.9.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.
1.9.2. Pro: A nuclear armed North Korea is a security threat for the United States.
1.9.2.1. Con: The US can deter a nuclear North Korea. Accepting its nuclear status therefore does not represent a security threat.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: There are [four variables](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.25) that underpin deterrence theory: the balance of military forces, costly signaling and bargaining behavior, reputations, and interests at stake. Based on these criteria, deterrence theory should not be applied to the standoff between the US and DPRK.
1.9.2.1.1.1. Pro: Military balance is not applicable in a confrontation between the US and DPRK. At this moment in time, DPRK poses no threat to destroy the US, whereas the US can completely annihilate DPRK.
1.9.2.1.1.2. Pro: Reputation for resolve is not applicable to the conflict between the US and DPRK. Neither side has shown a willingness to escalate beyond words for over 50 years.
1.9.2.1.1.2.1. Con: False, North Korea regularly engages in brinkmanship to extort concessions, even to the point of killing South Koreans.
1.9.2.1.1.3. Pro: Based on the interests at stake variable, deterrence theory should not be applied to the conflict between the DPRK and the US. The losses that the DPRK faces are huge relative to the losses that the US would face in a near-term confict \(before DPRK obtains nuclear ICBM's\).
1.9.2.1.1.4. Con: I suspect you might be confusing a colloquial use of 'deter' with a highly academic definition. If the user had said "The US can successfully discourage NK", would your counterpoint still stand?
1.9.2.1.2. Con: Of course it is a security threat, has been since its formation, and is now a greater threat for having nuclear weapons. A weaker claim would hold better: we are less likely to see NK use weapons by accepting reality than brinkmanship or otherwise attempting to force a situation where we just don't have good options.
1.9.2.1.3. Con: Accepting North Korea's nuclear status also creates an international norm which represents a long-term security threat to the US.
1.9.2.1.4. Con: The Kim Jon Un regime is different and classical deterrence theory doesn't apply.
1.9.2.1.4.1. Pro: North Korea treats its citizens brutally unlike other governments. This indicates that the regime is willing to sacrifice many and thus ignore deterrence.
1.9.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Any retaliation against North Korea would supposedly target, first and foremost, the leadership. That the country is willing to sacrifice civilians is therefore largely irrelevant.
1.9.2.1.5. Con: -> See 1.9.1.7.
1.9.2.1.6. Pro: A significant American strike force is deployed close to North Korea: some [50,000 soldiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forces_Japan) in Japan and another [37,500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forces_Korea) in South Korea.
1.9.2.1.6.1. Con: These troop numbers do nothing to deter a North Korea willing to utilize nuclear weapons.
1.9.2.1.6.1.1. Con: They do provide additional deterrence as any nuclear attack on South Korea or Japan would, inevitably, also hit American citizens and thus draw the US into a war.
1.9.2.1.7. Pro: Under no circumstances is it imaginable that North Korea would be able to disable America's [second strikes capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_strike) and, thus, the foundation of its nuclear deterrence.
1.9.2.1.7.1. Pro: America has a [nuclear triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_triad#United_States) that involves submarines equipped with nuclear weapons. It is inconceivable that North Korea could find and destroy all 18 of the currently active [Ohio-class submarines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio-class_submarine) that constitute this leg of the triad.
1.9.2.1.7.1.1. Pro: The North Korean navy [is considered](https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/how-dangerous-is-north-koreas-navy/) small, outdated and unable to operate far beyond the country's coasts.
1.9.2.1.7.2. Pro: North Korea's limited capacity to reach the continental US makes it difficult to imagine how it could disable all three American strategic nuclear missile bases in [Wyoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_E._Warren_Air_Force_Base), [North Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minot_Air_Force_Base) and [Montana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malmstrom_Air_Force_Base).
1.9.2.1.7.3. Pro: It is likely that the United States has nuclear weapons stationed in Japan as well as on submarines close to the Korean Peninsula. American nuclear retaliation is therefore only minutes away for North Korea.
1.9.2.1.7.4. Con: North Korea could sell a nuclear weapon to a terrorist group. That group could use it in a terrorist attack. A terrorist group is not a country so it would be difficult to find a target for second strike capabilities.
1.9.2.1.7.5. Con: North Korea lacks a robust second-strike capability from either bombers or [boomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile_submarine), which would force them to adopt a hair-trigger [launch-on-warning posture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_on_warning) that relies on missiles instead of the safer "retaliation after rideout" strategy [now used by the United States](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/1997_11-12/pdd), which means a technical glitch or human error could easily cause North Korea to launch first.
1.9.2.1.7.5.1. Pro: This almost happened during the Cold War. More than once.
1.9.2.1.8. Con: The Kim Regime rules by fear. Those who bring bad news to the Dear Leader may have a short life expectancy--we cannot assume Kim will have accurate information, thus we cannot assume he will be deterred by it. Kim could easily underestimate America's resolve to defend her allies and spark an escalating war by pushing his characteristic brinkmanship just a bit too far.
1.9.2.2. Con: As the US can defend itself against individual nuclear missiles from North Korea, it has no reason to oppose a North Korean nuclear state.
1.9.2.2.1. Pro: The US has an elaborate [missile defense system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_missile_defense).
1.9.2.2.1.1. Pro: [THAAD](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/thaad-south-koreas-best-defence-against-missile-attack/) is stationed in South Korea and has the ability to intercept nuclear missiles.
1.9.2.2.1.1.1. Con: THAAD might be '[overwhelmed](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/13/south-koreas-thaad-missile-shield-could-be-overwhelmed-by-pyongyang.html)' by swarm like attacks.
1.9.2.2.1.1.2. Con: THAAD was developed to [intercept short, medium and intermediate range missiles](http://missiledefenseadvocacy.org/missile-defense-systems-2/missile-defense-systems/u-s-deployed-intercept-systems/terminal-high-altitude-area-defense-thaad/). It is not equipped to deal with intercontinental ballistic missiles which North Korea would rely on to attack any American territories beyond Guam.
1.9.2.2.1.2. Con: The reliability of the American missile defense system has [persistently](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/united-states-missile-defense-system-probably-cant-stop-north-korea.html) [been](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/05/north-korea-missile-defense-240246) [called](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/elliott-negin/us-missile-defense-progra_b_11001052.html) [into](http://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2017/09/north-korea-more-missile-defense-not-answer/140822/) [question](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/americas-massive-missile-defense-mistake-10768) due to sub-optimal and varying success rates in tests, some of which did rely on unrealistic conditions.
1.9.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: [No element](https://warontherocks.com/2017/05/missile-defense-cant-save-us-from-north-korea/) of the American missile defense system except for the Patriot missile system has ever been tested in combat.
1.9.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: There are [various ways](https://warontherocks.com/2017/05/missile-defense-cant-save-us-from-north-korea/) in which North Korea could attempt to overwhelm the system, for example by firing multiple missiles or missiles with maneuverable entry vehicles.
1.9.2.2.2. Con: There are a number of US allies and interests within North Korean nuclear missile range which might not have the ability to intercept nuclear missiles.
1.9.2.2.2.1. Pro: Seoul, the capital of the US-allied South Korea and one of the most populous cities in the world, could be annihilated within minutes by North Korean nuclear weapons.
1.9.2.2.2.2. Pro: Being seen as unable or unwilling to act in its allies' defense will weaken the geopolitical standing of the US.
1.9.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.9.2.2.1.2.
1.9.2.2.4. Con: ICBMs are not the only method of delivering nuclear bombs. Even given reliable ICBM interceptors, there are other means of delivery the interceptors cannot stop.
1.9.2.2.4.1. Pro: A very short-range missile could be brought near the coast via a cargo ship, then launched from a floating tube. Interceptors would not have enough time to reach the warhead.
1.9.2.2.4.2. Pro: An atom bomb inside a cargo container could be set off in a port city before it's even unloaded from the cargo ship.
1.9.2.2.4.2.1. Con: The gamma radiation of the warhead could perhaps be detected remotely, even through lead shielding.
1.9.2.2.4.3. Pro: A sufficiently miniaturized warhead could be smuggled across the border by a single man, then set off by remote control in a major city.
1.9.2.2.4.3.1. Con: Said warhead may have to be hidden for a very long time. If detected, this might invite retaliation. Perhaps North Korea wouldn't risk this approach.
1.9.2.2.4.3.1.1. Con: North Korea has a track record brinkmanship/of taking extreme risks.
1.9.2.2.4.3.2. Con: A warhead that small would have a very low yield. Bad, yes, but doesn't change the strategic calculus.
1.9.2.2.4.3.2.1. Con: North Korea might smuggle in more than one and set them off simultaneously.
1.9.2.2.4.3.2.1.1. Con: This greatly increases the expense and risk of detection. Perhaps North Korea wouldn't try this approach.
1.9.2.2.4.3.2.2. Con: The yield could be boosted by smuggling in further components that are even harder to detect.
1.9.2.2.4.3.2.3. Con: Portable nuclear warheads that can be shot via rocket launchers, such as the American [W72](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W54#W72), are dozens of times more destructive than even the world's [most powerful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBU-43/B_MOAB) conventional bombs.
1.9.2.2.4.3.3. Con: Miniaturizing a bomb that much, while theoretically possible, is difficult. North Korea may never bother developing this capability if ICBMs are easier.
1.9.2.2.4.3.3.1. Con: If American missile defenses prove to be reliable \(or are improved to that point in the future\), North Korea may be motivated to develop this capability.
1.9.2.2.4.3.3.2. Con: Other countries have already done the engineering work. North Korea would have no qualms about stealing the plans covertly. They wouldn't have to develop it themselves.
1.9.2.2.4.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.2.4.3.2.3.
1.9.2.2.4.3.5. Pro: The theoretical minimum mass of a fission bomb is only about [15 kilograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suitcase_nuclear_device).
1.9.2.2.4.4. Pro: An atom bomb inside a cargo container could be set off in an airport near a major city before it's even unloaded from the cargo plane.
1.9.2.2.4.5. Pro: A torpedo with a nuclear warhead could be used to attack America's port cities. These would not show up on radar and could not be intercepted by antimissile systems anyway.
1.9.2.2.5. Con: North Korea could add decoys to the ICBM payload. This would make the real warheads very difficult to intercept.
1.9.2.3. Pro: The United States can't do accept a nuclear DPRK unless it decides to go to war, which I don't think most Americans, including the leadership, are willing to do. If North Korea actually uses a weapon, then there will be action.
1.9.3. Con: One main incentive behind North Korea's nuclear programme is obtaining respect and recognition. Recognizing them as a nuclear power will fulfill this need and make further saber rattling on their end unnecessary.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Sociological perspectives on proliferation and literature on related norms posit that nuclear weapons may serve a symbolic purpose by enhancing a country's international standing and prestige \([Sagan, p. 76](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539273?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\).
1.9.3.2. Con: If this were the case, North Korea could simply develop its nuclear weapons without the accompanying bellicose rhetoric towards its neighbors and the United States.
1.9.3.2.1. Con: A nuclear power would not be respected in the international arena if people thought the weapons only served a symbolic purpose. The international community does not currently believe North Korea can or would use nuclear weapons, so the bellicose rhetoric can be seen as an attempt at gaining that respect by convincing other actors that North Korea is indeed a threat.
1.9.3.2.2. Con: The bellicose rhetoric could serve the purpose of preventing any intervention from the outside. Once North Korea's nuclear deterrent is firmly established, this rhetoric might become unnecessary.
1.9.3.3. Pro: The two countries that North Korea supposedly worries about the most - the United States and South Korea - do not even recognize North Korea as a legitimate state.
1.9.4. Con: Attempting to force North Korea into abandoning its nuclear program carries an unacceptably high risk of killing millions of innocent people. The possible benefit of forcing North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons is not worth so many innocent lives.
1.9.4.1. Con: Inaction could risk more lives than action now.
1.9.4.1.1. Pro: The destructive capacity of the DPRK is growing. If the DPRK gets a full compliment of nuclear ICBM's they could kill more innocents than are at risk in a near-term war.
1.9.4.1.2. Pro: If the DPRK were to proliferate, millions of innocents would be at constant risk from an irrational & non deterrable counterparties \(i.e. terrorists & other non-state actors\)
1.9.4.1.3. Con: Soft power tactics are not inaction, and military intervention is not the sole option for taking action.
1.9.4.1.3.1. Pro: We could smuggle information in to undermine the regime's propaganda via things like leaflets or flash drives. This is already being done to some degree but could be scaled up at much lower cost than a military campaign.
1.9.4.1.3.2. Pro: We could counterfeit their currency and inject it into the country, both to undermine their economy and to shift the balance of power away from the regime.
1.9.4.1.3.3. Pro: We could document their concentration camps using spy drones and satellites and use it to dissuade North Korea's few remaining allies.
1.9.4.1.3.4. Pro: We could interdict and confiscate their ships in international waters. While technically a military action and an act of war, it doesn't look like an invasion, so it's less likely to escalate.
1.9.4.1.3.5. Pro: We could shame China into sending defectors to South Korea, instead of back to North Korea where they face severe punishment.
1.9.4.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.1.7.5.
1.9.5. Con: Building these bombs allows the North Korean government to hold South Korea hostage and prevent what has happened to Syria and Libya from happening to them. It is not in their interest to use them aggressively.
1.9.5.1. Con: A situation in which one actor holds another actor hostage is commonly not described as "stable" and implies a threat potential due to the risk of escalation.
1.9.5.2. Con: They were already [holding Seoul hostage with conventional and chemical artillery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_People%27s_Army#Capabilities), so that's probably not the reason they want nukes.
1.9.5.3. Con: Nuclear deterrence theory requires a credible second-strike capability. First-strike-only capability, on the other hand, incentivises the opponent to strike first. Thus, first-strike only is inherently destabilizing.
1.9.5.3.1. Con: As of 2013, analysts assumed that North Korea would likely [seek to develop](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/north-koreas-nuclear-weapons-future-strategy-and-doctrine) second strike capabilities and outlined ways in which could be achieved quite easily. It should be assumed that the country has developed this capability by now.
1.9.5.3.2. Pro: North Korea has only one part of the nuclear triad \(land-based missile launch systems\) but lacks the other two \(strategic bombers and submarines with nuclear weapons\). The former are relatively easy to destroy and the country's second-strike capability is therefore questionable.
1.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.2.
1.9.7. Con: North Korea is deterred from any utilization of its weapons - and especially its nuclear arsenal - by the overwhelming retaliation this would invite. Any aggression on its part is incompatible with the regime's goal of survival.
1.9.7.1. Pro: North Korea's past behavior indicates that regime survival is the country's main goal.
1.9.7.2. Con: Aggression could take place on a low level, for example through cyber attacks or terrorism, which would most likely not invite retaliation - and especially so if North Korea has nuclear weapons as a backup.
1.9.7.2.1. Con: Retaliation could happen on a lower level, for example on the economic one, and it could be made by China, which could be pressed by the US and its allies.
1.9.8. Pro: Nuclear-enabled North Korea would lose any fear of retaliation and gain total impunity to conventionally breach the armistice, attack ROK naval, land and civilian assets and kidnap international citizens as they please, because almost no DPRK action could be outrageous enough to risk a conflict with looming threat of nuclear escalation.
1.9.8.1. Con: North Korea has no interest in creating problems at an international level: in fact, Kim Jong-Un depends on China for both export and import, and China can be pressed by countries which have problems with North Korea.
1.9.9. Con: North Korea is simply trying to defend its independence. As long as the US doesn't try to force a bank down their throats, there is no reason to worry about aggression from North Korea.
1.10. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.
1.11. Pro: Accepting a nuclear-capable North Korea is a way to normalize them into the community of nations by giving them a defense to the existential conventional military threat against them.
1.11.1. Pro: As the Korean War was never ended through a peace treaty \(but only through an armistice\), North Korea is right to consider itself still at war with South Korea and the US. It is only natural that it strives to protect itself.
1.11.1.1. Con: Likewise, the US and her allies are right to consider North Korean WMDs a singular threat.
1.11.1.1.1. Con: No North Korean leader would attack the american mainland since this would guarantee their destruction.
1.11.1.1.1.1. Con: An attack on the mainland might be the result of escalation from a smaller conflict or perceived conflict. It need not be the first action to be the final outcome.
1.11.1.1.1.2. Con: An attack on American allies like South Korea or Japan would not be an attack on the American mainland.
1.11.2. Con: North Korea has survived for 70 years without the need of nuclear defence to prevent military threat against them.
1.11.2.1. Con: Yet these decades of survival have supposedly been anxious and uncomfortable for the country, especially after the end of the Cold War. Thus, the North Korea  nuclear program [began in earnest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_North_Korean_nuclear_program) at the end of the 1980s.
1.11.3. Pro: History gives justification for North Korea to still be wary of foreign powers, including the US.
1.11.3.1. Con: Other countries have been able to overcome grievances of the past. The North Korean wariness should therefore not be seen as an absolute constant.
1.11.3.1.1. Pro: Germany invaded and devastated France three times \(in 1870, 1914 and 1940\) and Poland in 1939, yet relations with these neighbors have become strong and amicable.
1.11.3.1.2. Pro: Although America fought Vietnam for more than half a decade in the 1960s and helped devastate it, relations with the country - ruled by the former enemy - are now at a "[historic high](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/05/23/fact-sheet-united-states-vietnam-relations)".
1.11.3.2. Pro: The Korean War left North Korea with a lasting impression of foreign aggressiveness and lack of mercy.
1.11.3.2.1. Pro: During the Korean War, the United States engaged in chemical warfare against North Korea, dropping [more than 30,000 tons](https://theintercept.com/2017/05/03/why-do-north-koreans-hate-us-one-reason-they-remember-the-korean-war/) of Napalm.
1.11.3.2.1.1. Con: Napalm doesn't count as a "chemical weapon" any more than gunpowder.
1.11.3.2.2. Pro: During the Korean War, the United States dropped [more bombs](http://apjjf.org/-Charles-K.-Armstrong/3460/article.html) on North Korea than it did on the whole Pacific theater in the Second World War.
1.11.3.2.3. Pro: The South and allies were responsible for starting the Korean war.
1.11.3.2.3.1. Con: The Korean war was essentially an escalation [of an ongoing civil war](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/books/review/Heilbrunn-t.html). There is no accountability in who "started" it.
1.11.3.2.3.2. Con: North Korea started the Korean War.
1.11.3.2.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.11.3.2.3.1.
1.11.3.2.3.2.2. Pro: There are at least four separate occasions before war broke out, when the North Korean leadership lobbied Stalin for permission and support to invade South Korea - first on 07 Mar 1949. By 30 Jan 1950, Stalin agreed \([Stueck, p. 70-77](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/Rethinking_the_Korean_War.html?id=RDJqqAOVfBQC&redir_esc=y)\).
1.11.3.2.4. Pro: During the Korean war southern forces and allies advanced [as far as the Yalu river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chongju_\(1950\)) instead of stopping back at the 38th parallel.
1.11.3.2.5. Pro: The US [engaged in biological warfare](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/3860439) by dropping infected insects on North Korea \([see also](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z9cJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1623&lpg=PA1623&dq=unamerican+activities+Report+of+the+International+Scientific+Commission+for+the+Investigation+of+the+Facts+Concerning+Bacterial+Warfare+in+Korea+and+China&source=bl&ots=4vby5Z6xVF&sig=5Ytlydbi-mfLS5VyC9k9QOavij8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiCyemG8P7WAhURLlAKHTPSCjoQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=unamerican%20activities%20Report%20of%20the%20International%20Scientific%20Commission%20for%20the%20Investigation%20of%20the%20Facts%20Concerning%20Bacterial%20Warfare%20in%20Korea%20and%20China&f=false) p1623\)
1.11.3.2.6. Pro: The United States has repeatedly [rejected](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-nuclear/u-s-rejected-north-korea-peace-talks-offer-before-last-nuclear-test-state-department-idUSKCN0VU0XE) North Korean offers of negotiating a peace treaty or linked talks about this topic to conditions unacceptable to North Korea.
1.11.3.2.7. Con: This impression is only sustained by propaganda, and is buckling wherever outside information gets through. When North Koreans learn of South Korean prosperity and freedom, their anger turns towards the North Korean regime.
1.11.3.3. Pro: The US and Russia colluded to split Korea against the will and continued efforts of Koreans \([Blum, p. 45](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=-IbQvd13uToC&printsec=frontcover&dq=killing+hope+blum&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=killing%20hope%20blum&f=false)\).
1.11.3.4. Pro: North Korea has only embraced a nuclear program because of a need to protect themselves from aggressive US imperialism.
1.11.3.4.1. Con: The artillery pointed at Seoul is sufficient deterrent. The nukes must be for something else.
1.11.3.4.1.1. Con: The fortified guns are a known quantity. The U.S. has probably mapped them all by now and could take them out or at least disable them very quickly using precision-guided munitions. It's not a sufficient deterrent anymore.
1.11.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Yes, but not before Seoul takes a pounding, leading to massive economic losses and mass casualties.
1.11.3.4.1.1.2. Con: North Korea likely also has road-mobile missile launchers with chemical warheads. These can't realistically be mapped and targeted in advance.
1.11.3.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.1.1.
1.11.3.4.1.3. Pro: Credible North Korean nuclear capability might deter the U.S. from defending her allies from a conventional North Korean attack.
1.11.3.4.1.3.1. Con: A conventional attack from North Korea would not be effective at all since the U.S. owns a huge conventional-answer-attack device in all the countries North Korea could attack \(Japan and South Korea\).
1.11.3.4.2. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.1.1.
1.11.3.5. Pro: Given the US military's aggressive behavior towards NK, both now and in the past, the rational response for NK is to arm itself with nuclear weapons to ward off what is a very real threat.
1.11.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.9.5.3.
1.11.4. Pro: By allowing its nuclear program, the USA cannot be regarded as an enemy of North Korea. Indeed, the USA would undermine the siege mentality of North Korea which feeds its perceived need of great military defenses.
1.11.4.1. Con: Sure they can. The propaganda machine sustaining the illusion of the regime's legitimacy depends on an "enemy" to distract from internal problems. That "enemy" has always been the United States.
1.11.4.1.1. Con: If the USA doesn't threaten North Korea, the animosity between these countries may disappear, regardless of past propaganda, beliefs and viewpoints.
1.11.5. Con: Even if the international community would accept North Korea as a nuclear power, it would remain a pariah state due to its human rights record and persistent hostility towards its neighbors.
1.11.6. Con: The Kim regime depends on remaining closed-off from the rest of the world to keep its people ignorant of the freedoms it denies them to remain in power. Accepting its nuclear capabilities will not change this.
1.11.6.1. Con: Even if its political system, economy and society remain closed-off, North Korea might diplomatically engage more with the international community.
1.12. Pro: America doesn't have any problems with the nuclear programs of other countries, and it should therefore not see the North Korean program as a problem either.
1.12.1. Con: We do have a problem with them and we do threaten them with the Mutual Assured Destruction doctrine, which we believe will deter them from using nuclear weapons. North Korea, on the other hand, may not be deterrable.
1.12.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.1.7.5.
1.12.2. Con: The Cold War, in large part as a result of a nuclear armed regime in the Eastern bloc that was ideologically opposed to the West \(as North Korea is today\), did produce problems for the US.
1.13. Pro: Pressure has not produced any progress so far.
1.13.1. Pro: The only progress that was ever made with North Korea regarding its nuclear program was based on inducements in the [1994 Agreed Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreed_Framework).
1.14. Con: By allowing North Korea to have nuclear weapons, the US would allow China to become a leading regional and ultimately global power.
1.14.1. Pro: Such a move would seal the US American [retreat from Asia](http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2120151/us-retreat-asia-drawing-china-japan-and-south-korea-closer), effectively ceding regional leadership to China.
1.14.1.1. Pro: As the largest regional power, China will inevitably be pushed into the role of having to maintain the delicate balance in the region once the US has retreated for good.
1.14.2. Con: North Korea has long acted against China's wishes by continuing its nuclear programme and relations between the two countries have been [deteriorating rapidly](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2017-12-12/why-china-wont-rescue-north-korea?cid=soc-tw-rdr) in recent years. Having a nominal ally continue such obstinate behaviour will weaken rather than strengthen the PRC.
1.14.3. Pro: A nuclear armed North Korea would also be a nuclear armed Chinese ally in the region, making it clearly militarily superior to any former US allies like Japan or South Korea, who have always relied on the [US nuclear umbrella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_umbrella#Japan) rather than their own military capabilities.
1.14.4. Con: China is already a regional and global power.
1.15. Con: If the US stops trying to prevent a nuclear North Korea, it runs the risk of being blackmailed by North Korea.
1.15.1. Con: The US has no track record of giving in to threats.
1.15.1.1. Pro: The [Foal Eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foal_Eagle) military exercise went ahead despite threats from North Korea.
1.15.1.2. Con: There's a first time for everything.
1.15.2. Con: -> See 1.9.2.2.
1.15.3. Pro: If his bluster is to be believed, KJU aspires to control the entire Korean peninsula. If he had an arsenal of ICBM's, he may use them to threaten the west if any opposition is mounted to an attack on the South.
1.15.4. Con: The US has yet to be blackmailed by it's nuclear capable non-allies \(India, China\) who are significantly stronger than DPRK.
1.15.5. Con: This applies to any sort of military force. Military threats are a normal part of international diplomacy and always have been.
1.15.5.1. Con: By that logic, the U.S. is justified in using threats to try to force North Korea to abandon her nukes.
1.16. Con: -> See 1.11.3.4.1.3.
1.17. Pro: The goal needs to be getting North Korea participating opening in international arms agreements, especially nuclear proliferation agreements. Denuclearization can come over time as part of this. Willing participation is more important.
1.17.1. Con: North Korea has a history of using negotiations to buy time for further arms development. No substantial sanctions should be reduced without concrete, measurable \(and verifiable\) concessions from North Korea.
