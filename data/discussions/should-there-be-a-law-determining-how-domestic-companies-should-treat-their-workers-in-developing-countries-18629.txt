Discussion Title: Should there be a law determining how domestic companies should treat their workers in developing countries?

1. There should be laws determining how domestic companies treat their workers in developing countries.
1.1. Con: Prices would rise for domestic consumers if Western standards were applied to developing countries.
1.1.1. Con: It is immoral to continue benefiting from artificially low prices at the expense of workers in the developing world.
1.1.2. Pro: Increased prices unfairly affect those who are already struggling [financially](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty-in-rich-countries-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-know).
1.2. Con: Even if they're not receiving Western sized wages, the workers are still [earning more](https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/international/sweatshops-make-poor-people-better-off) than they would otherwise.
1.3. Pro: People in developing countries are guaranteed to have basic rights regarding work, like clean toilets and a limited working week.
1.3.1. Pro: Many people in the developed world would expect these standards to be met in their working lives. If we believe in equality, then we should show [solidarity](https://www.ictu.ie/globalsolidarity/workersrights/allworkershaverights.html) and demand them for those who produce our goods too.
1.3.2. Con: This may well come at the expense of having employment at all. It is not irrational to want to have a job rather than fight for specific standards.
1.4. Con: Checking whether the law is being followed would be very expensive and difficult. The inspectors would have to travel all around the world.
1.4.1. Con: Local contractors could be used to carry out inspections.
1.5. Con: Every country makes its own rules. Applying one country's rules to another is colonialism.
1.5.1. Con: This could be mandated by fining the company domestically thus not infringing sovereignty.
1.5.1.1. Con: The effect remains unchanged. For the same reason that richer nations should not offer aid tied to unfair [requirements](https://borgenproject.org/rwanda-ends-tied-aid-donors/), we should not do this. Legally, no sovereignty is breached, but this action forces the hand of developing nations.
1.5.2. Pro: The limited regulations of developing countries often facilitate employment and economic growth that would not occur under more stringent regulation. By enforcing the strict regulations of developed countries on these nations, they are denied crucial opportunities for growth and development.
1.5.2.1. Pro: U.S boycotts of sweatshops in Nicaragua caused such [devastation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/16/globalisation.charlottedenny) for local workers that they mounted protests in favour of free trade.
1.5.3. Con: The vast majority of countries have already [ratified](https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:10011:::NO:10011:P10011_DISPLAY_BY,P10011_CONVENTION_TYPE_CODE:1,F) the International Labour Organization's [core conventions](http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm) that specify labour standards.
1.6. Con: Corporations would just move their seat elsewhere.
1.6.1. Pro: There is a significant first mover problem. International companies are capable of moving jurisdiction should one country introduce this law.
1.6.2. Con: The law could be introduced for selling goods in a developed country, rather than having your main seat in a country.
1.7. Con: Due to the wide range of professions and their needs, it would be extremely difficult to define the law.
1.8. Pro: It will end or at least slow down the corporations' chase after the country with the lowest workers right. Together with a taxation corridor this could really help making the world a better place.
1.8.1. Con: Workers in poor countries would be worse off without work opportunities from Western corporations.
1.8.2. Pro: This would increase the number of jobs available in developed countries.
1.8.3. Pro: This would reduce exploitation, such as unsafe working [conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/rana-plaza-gap-worker-safety), which can occur when businesses are interested in exploiting cheap labour.
1.9. Pro: We would have a better feeling when shopping.
1.9.1. Con: Consumers who wish to feel better when shopping can look to movements such as [Fair Trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_trade) that identify ethical producers. For those who don't care, this policy is not necessary.
1.9.2. Pro: Consumers are willing to pay up to [30%](https://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/stakeholder_trends_insights/brynn_mcnally/study_consumers_are_willing_pay_30_more_fai) more for fair trade goods. This suggests that ethically produced goods are in higher demand and so would fetch a higher price.
1.9.3. Con: Making consumers feel more positive about their actions should not factor into a decision that would radically change the economic prospects of many developing countries.
1.10. Pro: The law would reduce unfair competition.
1.10.1. Pro: Domestic workers would no longer compete against developing country peers with cheaper costs due to lower safety standards.
1.10.1.1. Con: This competitions is vital for developing nations. A more cost effective workforce is a key advantage that they hold relative to developed nations.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: This competition is artificial. It is only possible becasue of the [abuse](http://time.com/4374377/slavery-developed-developing-world-index-slave-labor/) of workers in the developed world. Basic standards could be met, while still remaining cheaper than labour in the developed world.
1.10.2. Con: Better worker treatment will attract brighter minds. These will outcompete domestic workers in terms of productivity.
