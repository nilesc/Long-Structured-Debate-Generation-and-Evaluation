1. Kids in schools should wear uniforms.
1.1. Pro: Uniforms are more aesthetically pleasing.
1.1.1. Con: Many school uniforms are unfashionable, particularly in [China](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/932652.shtml), where they have a reputation of being ugly and poorly made.

1.2. Pro: School uniforms make the decision of what to wear easier compared to the thousands of options created by leaving options.
1.2.1. Pro: The competitive element of choosing one's own clothing can lead to bullying and division in schools.

1.6.1. Con: Not really. If schools still foster creativity in other ways there will be no issues with creativity.
