Discussion Title: What is the best religion to believe?

1. What [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) should people follow?
1.1. [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism)
1.1.1. Con: Jesus was the Messiah.
1.1.1.1. Pro: If Jesus is not God, than he was crazy or a very evil liar, because only someone who is crazy or a very evil liar would falsely claim to be God.  But he clearly wasn't an evil liar because he willingly died for teaching a very good moral code, which no evil man would do. He spoke and acted like someone who was sane. Therefore Jesus is God and to follow him is true religion.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Another possibility oft forgotten within the "Liar, Lunatic, Lord" argument is the fourth option of a "Legend", which posits that many of the characteristics and teachings applied to Jesus may be false or half-truths.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The written accounts of Jesus' life were too soon after the events to allow for the events to have developed [as myth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6phCsPbjfg&list=PLIpO3BUiq2IHGVH6rDrtI5O6F6I-aw5ff&index=44).
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Scott Alexander, the author of the Slate Star Codex blog, wrote a good response to the “Lord, Liar, Lunatic” argument on his old blog: [web.archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20171119034622/http://squid314.livejournal.com:80/343999.html) Basically, one can say that Jesus was a “lunatic” in a very broad sense of the word, so broad that it does not much impair the claim that he was a wise moral teacher.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: It’s possible that Jesus did not actually claim to be God, but was claimed to be so by his followers after he died.
1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Not too many followers are interested in getting themselves killed for a lie. Of his closest followers \(disciples\), John alone is understood to have died naturally.
1.1.1.1.4. Con: All liars are not evil.
1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Plato describes the possibility that a [noble lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_lie) could be created in order to maintain social harmony.
1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See discussion #15593: Jesus is the promised Messiah of the ancient Hebrew religion.
1.1.1.3. Pro: He [fulfilled all the prophecies](http://www1.cbn.com/biblestudy/biblical-prophecies-fulfilled-by-jesus) necessary to affirm His claim.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: There are many prophesies in the Old Testament that were fulfilled by Jesus, such as this list of [the top 40 prophesies](https://jewsforjesus.org/answers/top-40-most-helpful-messianic-prophecies/).
1.1.1.3.2. Con: The Gospels were written well after the death of Jesus. It is possible that the authors of the Gospels added details to make it seem as though he fulfilled the prophecies.
1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: The Gospels were written by individuals drawing from either personal first hand experience or the first hand experience of reliable witnesses.
1.1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: If the New Testament authors were making false claims for personal gain, they would not have universally committed to martyrdom.
1.1.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: The gospels contain accounts embarrassing to the early church founders and are therefore likely not outright fabrications.
1.1.1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: The gospel describes Peter's [three denials of Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial_of_Peter). This is an embarrassing account that would likely not be written unless it was true.
1.1.1.3.2.2. Con: The Dead Sea Scrolls likely [predate Jesus's ministry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls#Age) and contain prophecies regarding the Messiah that were fulfilled by Jesus.
1.1.1.3.2.3. Con: [The evidence indicates](http://coldcasechristianity.com/2015/why-i-know-the-gospels-were-written-early-free-bible-insert/) the Gospels are, indeed, early enough to have been written by eyewitnesses. If they were written this early, in the very region where the events took place, it would have been difficult for them to include obvious lies, given that they would have been written to people who were alive during the events recorded in the New Testament. These people would have been available to vet the content of the Gospels and call them out as lies if they contained fallacious information.
1.1.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: The relative proliferation of biblical texts compared to other writings of the time would have made such obvious lies especially difficult to gain the momentum they did as the foundation of the world's eventual most popular religion.
1.1.1.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: The dispersion of early Christians away from Judea begins with Acts 8 with Philip going into Caesarea, the Ethiopian going to Africa. Paul goes into Europe, perhaps as far as Spain, with the message spreading faster than he does. Thomas is even reported to have made it to India. All of these events happen at least a decade before the destruction of the second temple. If the message was later changed, it would have been very hard to convince the vast people who had learned the original message.
1.1.1.3.2.3.2. Con: Even if the Gospels were written when eyewitnesses were alive, and eyewitnesses “called out” certain aspects of the Gospels as lies, their act of calling out may not have been preserved over the past 2000 years.
1.1.1.3.3. Con: The purpose of Christian prophetic works was not to tell the future, but to tell people what was God's will.
1.1.1.3.3.1. Con: The purpose could easily be both to tell the future and describe God's will.
1.1.1.3.4. Con: It is irrelevant whether or not Jesus fulfilled prophecies if Christianity does not produce good fruit.
1.1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Christians today use means that their God would find detestable to achieve their desires.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1. Con: The errant theology of a particular group does not invalidate the premise of the belief itself.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: If the Holy Spirit existed, it would more clearly empower its believers to act in accordance with its existence.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The Holy Spirit is there to [teach and remind us](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A26&version=NIV) \(and more\). It's still up to us to take action, or allow it to lead us. The fact that you may have parents that teach you and guide you from doing the wrong things, and you don't listen and act accordingly, doesn't question their existence or their advice/teachings. You still have the choice.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.1.2. Con: You cannot prove the Holy Spirit doesn't exist because of the lack of change in people. All that it will prove, is that people are living in disobedience or not really Christian. This was warned in [Matthew 13:1-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A1-23&version=NKJV) in the parable of the sower.
1.1.1.3.4.1.2. Con: This is [predicted](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3fsearch=Matthew%2b13:24-29&version=NIV&interface=amp) in the Bible and adds veracity to the claims of the Bible since there are those who practice the religion faithfully as well.
1.1.1.3.4.1.3. Pro: -> See discussion #3936: American Christians should not be patriotic, nor view themselves as American (according to the Bible)
1.1.1.3.4.2. Pro: The majority of Christians today do not worship the God of the Bible.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Christians frequently describe the world as "fallen," while the world is [good](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1&version=NIVUK).
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.1. Con: Genesis 1 was before "the fall", when Adam and Eve sinned. [Genesis 3:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A17&version=NIVUK) talks about the ground being cursed because of Adam. So even though it was good, it is now cursed.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1. Con: God did not take back his blessing of Adam and Eve. [Genesis 1:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A28&version=NIRV)
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: God does not take back his gifts. [Romans 11:29-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+11%3A29-31&version=NIRV)
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.2. Con: The Psalms repeatedly praise God for the goodness of his creation. If creation were not good, it would be wrong to do so.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.3. Con: Believing that things are not good is the root of many if not every sin.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Eve believes that God did not make her wise enough, so she eats from the tree.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: [God tells Cain](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+4%3A6-8&version=NIV) to "calm down and overcome the temptation to sin" right before he kills Abel.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.3.3. Pro: The Israelites in the desert repeatedly refuse to believe that what God has given them is good and are eventually punished.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.3.4. Pro: The people of Sodom and Gomorrah oppressed the poor and needy because they wanted more than they were given.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.3.5. Pro: The kingdom of Israel split in half because Rehoboam wanted more than God gave him.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.4. Con: God does not curse the man or the woman. He curses the ground. So if anything has fallen, the soil has, but not the plants, the animals, the firmament, the man, his wife, the seas...
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.2. Pro: There is no Old Testament idea of a "Fall". It's a made up idea.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.2.1. Con: The word fallen is used in the Bible to describe someone or something spiritually and morally degraded. Israel is described as “fallen” \([Amos 5:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Amos+5%3A2&version=KJV)\), as is Babylon \([Isaiah 14:12](http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-12.htm)\) and the glory of mankind \([1 Peter 1:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1%3A24-25&version=NIV)\). Each of these has fallen away from the heights of God’s good will for them, fallen into sin, and therefore fallen under the just wrath of God. Those in a fallen state suffer the degrading and deadly spiritual, moral and social consequences of sinfulness.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Amos 5:2 talks about Israel the nation literally falling apart as the Assyrians destroy it. If it was talking about its sinful nature they would not have called it "the virgin Israel."
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Isaiah 14:12 is prophesying the literal collapse of the Babylonian empire as the Persians come to conquer them.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: While it prophesies the literal collapse of Babylon, it is due to their moral/spiritual degradation that God allows this; God isn't unjust. Isaiah 14:5-6 explains that they're wicked and unrelentingly persecute others. Isaiah 14:13-14 goes on to explain their arrogance, how they say in their hearts that they will be like God.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.2.1.3. Con: 1 Peter 1:24 is using a metaphor of flowers to talk about how God is the only thing that gives life any meaning in a statement similar to Ecclesiastes by referencing Isaiah, which is discussing how our lives are fleeting and hard, but God is here for us. [Isaiah 40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+40&version=NLT)
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.2.1.3.1. Con: If God's creation is good \(perfect\), why is the glory of mankind/flesh \(as described in 1 Peter 1:24\) not good as well? Why does the flesh wither and its glory fall like a flower? Why is the natural state not good and we need to be born again to be imperishable seed \(1 Peter 1:23\)? Because something changed us in Genesis.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1.3. Con: The "fall" is not supposed to mean God did a bad job, that what He created is not good. His creation is wonderful and brilliant as attested in multiple places in the Bible \(e.g. Psalms\). But the world is fallen because of our sin. We degrade each other and God's good creation even further by our sinful nature. Our sinful nature is what is bad and what corrupts. [Galatians 5:13-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A13-25&version=NIV)
1.1.1.3.4.2.2. Pro: Christians focus on the sin of the characters of the Bible, while God focuses on their goodness.
1.1.1.3.4.2.2.1. Pro: Nineveh, despite all its sin, is [saved](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jonah+3&version=NIV) merely for humbling itself before God.
1.1.1.3.4.2.2.2. Con: God doesn't focus on the goodness of people in the Bible. Good deeds, their faith and love are mentioned but almost the entire Bible's focus is on how we struggle to do what is right, and yet God's mercy, love and grace is what is highlighted. Christians may look like they focus on sin, because they try to make people aware that without God's love, mercy and grace, they will be lost.
1.1.1.3.4.2.2.3. Pro: [Ahab](http://biblehub.com/sermons/auth/macdonald/ahab's_repentance.htm), despite all his sin, is saved merely by humbling himself before the Lord.
1.1.1.3.4.2.2.4. Pro: Judges is viewed as repeated examples of the Israelites sinning, when their sins are generally not detailed, but God's redemptive work is detailed. The author clearly is focusing on God's mercy.
1.1.1.3.4.2.3. Pro: Christians erroneously misinterpret the Book of Revelation and therefore believe that Jesus will *definitely* return and punish the unrighteous.
1.1.1.3.4.2.3.1. Pro: Modern Christians misunderstand the coming of God's kingdom in the same way that the Jews did before John the Baptist. They wanted the Messiah to become king by force, and Modern Christians want God's kingdom to be established by force.
1.1.1.3.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: The book of Revelation describes how by sacrifice, the Lamb and his servants will overcome the world. Not by war and death.
1.1.1.3.4.2.3.1.2. Pro: Jesus described the coming of his kingdom with metaphors that do not fit a conquering king.[Weedy field, Growing seed, yeast, treasure hunter](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13)
1.1.1.3.4.2.3.2. Con: Jesus's return is not just prophesied in the Book of Revelation, but also in Matthew, Mark and Luke. In [Matthew 25:31-46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A31-46&version=ESV) Jesus explains how he will separate the righteous and unrighteous and cast the unrighteous into the eternal fire.
1.1.1.3.4.2.3.2.1. Con: It seems likely that God will use his servant, the church, to prevent the death of everyone.
1.1.1.3.4.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: In the story of Jonah, the destruction of the Ninevites is prophesied, but God uses Jonah to turn aside God's wrath.
1.1.1.3.4.2.3.2.1.2. Pro: In Exodus 32, God says he will destroy the Israelites, but God uses Moses to prevent this destruction.
1.1.1.3.4.2.3.2.2. Con: In [Matthew 25:46](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/matthew/25-46.htm) the words used are [kolasin](http://biblehub.com/greek/2851.htm) [aionion](http://biblehub.com/greek/166.htm). Which more clearly would be translated as age of punishment. No eternal fire is mentioned.
1.1.1.3.4.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.4.1.3.
1.1.1.3.4.2.5. Con: Incorrect interpretation of the Bible does not disprove Christianity. It proves how fallible people are. If it's there in black and white, and they're not listening, it's not because the Bible or God is errant.
1.1.1.3.4.2.6. Pro: Most Christians today have forgotten Jesus's message behind "[it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.](http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-24.htm)"
1.1.1.3.4.2.7. Pro: The Calvinist belief underpinning Protestantism that 'worldly success as an indication of God's favor' is not a Biblical teaching.
1.1.1.3.4.2.8. Pro: Modern Christians view the Kingdom of Heaven as not having already come while the Bible disagrees with this statement. Jesus [said](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+17%3A20-37&version=NIVUK), "The kingdom is in your midst".
1.1.1.3.4.2.8.1. Con: There is a distinction between the spiritual aspect of this kingdom, which has indeed come, and the actual physical manifestation of that kingdom, which has yet to arrive.
1.1.1.3.4.2.8.1.1. Pro: The physical manifestation of God's Kingdom is the physical manifestation of any Kingdom. It's people. There is no other physical manifestation of any kingdom other than the people who follow or are subjugated to the king.
1.1.1.3.4.3. Con: It is very relevant whether Jesus fulfilled prophecies. If He didn't fulfill the prophesies, He would not be the Messiah, making Christianity false. If Christianity is false, it would be irrelevant if Christianity produced good fruit.
1.1.1.3.4.3.1. Con: When Jesus teaches how to evaluate the validity of a teaching, he states that the way you tell whether a teaching is valid or not is by its fruit. [Matthew 7:15-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7)
1.1.1.4. Pro: The archaeological, historical, and textual evidence of the Old and New Testaments of Christianity are the most robust, coherent, and convincing of all religious texts.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Several archaeological finds have [corroborated](http://coldcasechristianity.com/2018/a-brief-sample-of-old-testament-archaeological-corroboration/) passages in the Old Testament.
1.1.1.4.2. Pro: The list of verified [historical figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biblical_figures_identified_in_extra-biblical_sources) mentioned in the Bible is extensive.
1.1.1.4.2.1. Con: These figures were likely common knowledge to the writers of the Bible, as they were sufficiently well-known to have multiple sources for their existence outside of the Bible.
1.1.1.4.3. Con: Relative historical accuracy does not imply that the supernatural elements of the Bible are true.
1.1.1.4.3.1. Con: To refuse the possibility of miracles, \(the breaking of physical laws by one not bound by physical laws \(i.e. god\)\) begs the question. The possibility of miracles is not disproven by the fact that there are physical laws.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: [Miracles do not violate natural laws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YsEYj-4lCY)
1.1.1.5. Con: There is no such thing as a Messiah.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: "[Messiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah)" just means "savior" or "liberator." Historical, non-secular figures, including Cyrus the Great, have been [labeled](http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4828-cyrus#anchor7) messiahs.
1.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Jesus being a “messiah” in the sense that Cyrus the Great was a messiah does nothing to prove that Christianity is true.
1.1.2. Con: Ishmael is the proper descendant of Abraham, who went on to establish a great nation, as promised by God in the Old Testament. \([Genesis 17:20](http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0117.htm#20)\)
1.1.2.1. Pro: Ishmael is being recognised [in Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmael_in_Islam) as the ancestor of several prominent tribes and of Muhammad.
1.1.2.2. Con: According to the Hebrew Bible, Isaac rather than Ishmael was the true heir of the Abrahamic tradition and covenant. \([Genesis 17:21](http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0117.htm#21)\)
1.1.2.3. Con: According to Torah, both Isaac and Ishmael begot great nations, and it was the job of all Abraham's descendants to be a blessing to all nations.
1.1.3. Pro: The god of Abraham is the one true god.
1.1.3.1. Con: One of the first words of Hebrew Genesis 1:1 is Elohim, which when translated can mean "gods", [plural](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9D).
1.1.3.1.1. Con: The God of the Bible is understood to be a [trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity). Three persons or Gods in one ultimate being.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: This is a difficulty with the [English word God](https://thebibleproject.com/podcast/theme-god-e1-god-or-gods/), 'elohim' does not refer to multiple 'Gods' but multiple 'gods'.
1.1.3.2. Con: This is a claim by the same god \([Isa 43:10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/isa/43/10/s_722010), [Surah Al-Ikhlas 112:1-4](https://quran.com/112)\), and has yet to be proven.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: The god of Abraham has shown he is the one true god through the exodus, the miracles of his prophets, and the miracles and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
1.1.3.3. Pro: The only god worth believing in is a God that is [abundant in mercy](https://www.cgg.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Library.verses/ID/2573/Gods-Benevolence.htm).
1.1.3.3.1. Con: Religions other than the Abrahmic religions believe in such a God.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: [Hindus](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-nature-of-god-in-hinduism-1770061) believe in an all-merciful god, Brahman.
1.1.3.4. Pro: Three of the main religions in this world \(Christianity, Judaism, and Islam\) worship the Abrahamic god.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: That’s just because Christianity and Islam originated from Judaism, it’s not independent corroboration.
1.1.3.4.2. Con: If this is evidence then it means that the three choices of Islam, Judaism or Christianity are equivalent.
1.1.3.4.2.1. Con: The sanctity of the one true God has been corrupted by earthly desires of money, power, and through the illusion of choice.
1.1.3.4.3. Con: The fact that three religions agree on something does not make it true.
1.1.4. Pro: Judaism has meditative Midrash: an effective and functional liturgical mechanism.
1.1.5. Pro: Judaism is the origin of all other Abrahamic religions and the source of the Old Testament.
1.1.5.1. Pro: It is a Christian duty to recover Jewry from it's lost and fallen status. Jesus' teachings were not meant to destroy the law, rather, they set the example of grace. Jewry is a heritage of the Lord, which suffered long persecutions and captivity. All of this was for righteousness' sake. Without such righteousness, Christendom would not be. Christianity is not a self-contained product of an isolated God.
1.1.5.2. Con: Jews rejected the most important part of the Bible - the Gospel.
1.1.5.3. Con: According to Judeo-Christian thought, the Bible came from God, and while Jews certainly wrote it they do not have ownership of God's inspired text.
1.1.6. Pro: They do not proselytise.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Proselytizing is really annoying.
1.1.6.2. Pro: The call for proselytizing and conversion, and the inevitable violence caused by such a call, makes a religion morally inferior to religions that do not have such a call.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: In case of Christianity, Christ clearly taught nonviolence so violence is not inevitable even in efforts to convert others.
1.1.6.3. Con: If having correct beliefs is really important, then convincing others to have correct beliefs is important as well.
1.1.6.4. Con: The fact that a religion does not proselytize does not make it true.
1.1.7. Pro: Judaism offers the best moral code.
1.1.7.1. Con: Judaism is too legalistic, and some Jews still [follow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haredi_Judaism#Practices_and_beliefs) outdated Old Testament laws.
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: Haredi Jewish men largely devote themselves to studying the Torah rather than working, which contributes to high levels of [poverty](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/israel-falls-short-in-attempts-to-integrate-haredi-men-into-workforce-1.5454088) within Haredi communities.
1.1.7.2. Con: Judaism is not a moral code, but an expression of [Sh'ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shema_Yisrael), which commands that one love God.
1.1.7.3. Pro: Judaism is a religion of peace.
1.1.7.3.1. Pro: Judaism is [closely connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_and_violence#Nonviolence) to the philosophy of nonviolence.
1.1.8. Pro: Judaism allows for intellectual and spiritual differences among adherents, with [some denominations](http://www.shj.org/) even allowing agnosticism.
1.1.8.1. Con: Allowing for a diversity of beliefs need not be a good thing.
1.1.8.1.1. Pro: Allowing for a diversity of beliefs means either allowing for the truth along with a bunch of false beliefs, or worse just allowing a bunch of false beliefs and not the truth.
1.1.8.2. Con: The fact that a religion allows for a diversity of beliefs does not make it true.
1.1.9. Pro: Judaism has a long and evolving culture, which is fun to belong to, including melodies, festivals, and food dating back thousands of years.
1.1.9.1. Pro: Community and cultural aspects are still part of Judaism, and have value independently of whether God exists.
1.1.9.2. Con: The notion that it’s fun to be a Jew does not mean that Judaism is true or that you should be a Jew.
1.1.9.2.1. Pro: Lots of evil things can be fun for various people.
1.1.9.2.1.1. Pro: Serial killers find killing fun.
1.1.9.2.1.2. Pro: Judaism prohibits adultery, but people often commit adultery precisely because of its enjoyability.
1.1.10. Pro: Jews are much [more intelligent](http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/culture/features/1478/index1.html) than average. Despite making up 0.25% of the world's population, they make up 27% of Nobel Laureates, 25% of all ACM Turing Award winners, and 50% of global chess champions. 23 per 1000 Ashkenazi Jews have an IQ 140 or higher, compared to 4 per 1000 in the general population.
1.1.10.1. Con: IQ averages do not prove the truth of a religion.
1.1.11. Pro: Jews have survived multiple attacks throughout history, showing that the religion can survive through anything and they aren't going anywhere anytime soon.
1.1.11.1. Pro: In its short history, Israel has [fought and won](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Israel) several wars.
1.1.11.2. Pro: During World War II, Jewish people were systematically exterminated as part of [the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust), yet their religion and cultural identity persisted.
1.1.11.3. Con: False beliefs often persist over extended periods of time.
1.1.11.3.1. Pro: To this day there is still an [International Flat Earth Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies).
1.1.11.3.2. Pro: 39% of Americans still [don't believe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#Recent_public_beliefs) in Darwin's theory of evolution.
1.1.11.3.3. Pro: If Judaism is true, a lot of false religions have persisted for an awfully long time.
1.2. Ancient/revived religions
1.2.1. Pro: [Hellenism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_religion)
1.2.1.1. Pro: Hellenism is an [official religion](https://www.worldreligionnews.com/religion-news/hellenism-officially-recognized-religion-greece) in Greece.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Hellenism [promotes](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/02/22/the-ancient-greek-practice-of-hellenism-lives-on-as-a-modern-religion/) the ancient Greek virtues of "moderation, reciprocity, and self-control".
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Many religions promote these values; Hellenism is not unique.
1.2.1.3. Pro: [Tales](https://www.planetebook.com/free-ebooks/the-odyssey.pdf) about Hellenistic [deities](http://www.talesbeyondbelief.com/greek-gods-mythology/greek-gods-mythology-index.htm) are subjectively more exciting than those of other religions and gods, catching the eye of the entertainment industry time and time again.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Many [popular films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_based_on_Greco-Roman_mythology) have been made based on Greek mythology.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Many more films have been made based on [Christian theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_films).
1.2.1.3.2. Con: Whether something is exciting is not a good reason to believe in it.
1.2.1.3.3. Con: Christianity has formed a huge part of our cultural milieu, so we have been desensitzed to its extremely exciting elements. It is therefore difficult to truly assess its excitement value.
1.2.2. Pro: [Neopaganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Paganism)
1.2.2.1. Pro: Paganism is traditionally open-minded to other gods and beliefs.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Neo-paganism instills traditional virtues of a society that fits well with its cultural traditions, leaving the practitioner with a non-contradictory identity.
1.2.2.3. Con: While neo-pagans often have strong value systems and historical substance, logical arguments to support the various claims are sorely lacking.
1.2.2.4. Con: These beliefs are often exclusionary, and cannot be an answer to all peoples' questions of life and meaning.
1.3. "Alternative" religions
1.3.1. Pro: [Pastafarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster)
1.3.1.1. Con: A federal court has [ruled](https://www.rt.com/usa/339519-judge-flying-spaghetti-god/) that Pastafarianism is not a religion, but a parody of religion.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: The right to wear Pastafarian religious headgear - a colander - on identity photos or in official ceremonies [has](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2382465/Im-Pastafarian-Man-claims-religion-forces-wear-sieve-head-given-permission-wear-official-identity-card-picture.html) [been](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/11/17/pastafarian-drivers-license/19200447/) [upheld](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/pastafarian-minister-christopher-schaeffer-is-sworn-into-new-york-town-council-9044607.html) on multiple occasions around the world. This indicates at least some recognition for Pastafarianism as a legitimate religion.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: -> See discussion #18098: To ban rights for Pastafarians is a violation of human rights and religious equality.
1.3.1.2. Con: Pastafarianism was [created](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1498162/In-the-beginning-there-was-the-Flying-Spaghetti-Monster.html) in 2005 by Bobby Henderson, a 25-year-old, unemployed physics graduate from Oregon as an intended satire of Creationism.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: We are not sure about who created other religions mentioned in this debate and with what motives. The fact that we do know this about Pastafarianism because of its recent nature and complete openness about its roots should not be used for condemning the religion.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Pastafarianism [welcomes anyone](https://www.venganza.org/about/) to join the religion without giving up their other beliefs.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: This would require that all other beliefs are compatible with Pastafarianism, however since it makes truth claims that are not compatible with other religions it really doesn’t achieve such a thing.
1.3.1.4. Pro: This is the only one true-religion because the signs of the Flying Spaghetti Monster have been seen [in clouds](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/84/04/fc/8404fcfad67b52263fecd7961f956278.jpg), [in walls](http://wading-in.net/walkabout/2011/10/now-this-is-proof/), and in [French Toasts](https://www.venganza.org/2011/01/gay-marriage/comment-page-12/). The links show undeniable evidences.
1.3.2. Pro: [Unitarian Universalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarian_Universalism)
1.3.2.1. Pro: God has a perfect understanding of good and evil. Humans do not, but their understanding does improve. As this understanding improves, we also become more interconnected in both secular and religious spheres.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: The [Alpha](https://alpha.org/) program encourages debates about Christianity and religious inter-connectivity.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: This doesn’t constitute evidence that unitarian universalism is true.
1.3.2.1.1.2. Con: Many people of different religions support and engage in debate officially and unofficially, this is not unique.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: The [World Economic Forum](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_AM17_Religious_Leaders.pdf) brings religious leaders together to "inspire responsive and responsible leadership."
1.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.
1.3.2.3. Con: According to any theory that claims "All are saved", people who cannot conform to the required bounds of salvation either 1\) do not exist or 2\) are forced to conform against their nature. But there are certain people who, at their core, will not conform.
1.3.2.4. Con: Selfishness, cruelty, or other evils are not punished, but rewarded with mercy in salvation.
1.3.2.4.1. Con: Mercifulness is a positive trait.
1.3.2.4.2. Con: The same is true in Christianity.
1.3.3. Pro: [Deism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism)
1.3.3.1. Pro: A "first cause" that created the world, but does not intervene in current affairs, makes no assumptions about the universe, and so best fits our observations about the world.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Deism acknowledges that the complexity of the world required some kind of complex creator, or "first cause", but does not go any further \(i.e., miracles\).
1.4. Non-theistic belief systems
1.4.1. Pro: [Atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism)
1.4.1.1. Pro: Religion is irrelevant and even thinking about it consumes precious time useful elsewhere.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: This is circular reasoning, it certainly would be relevant if a god does exist.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: This argument supports agnosticism, not atheism. Atheism is not a default view, it requires proof.
1.4.1.1.3. Con: There is no empirical means of determining morality without first adding an un-empirical assertion. Therefore, either the un-scientific religion of philosophy or another religion must be employed to provide these un-empirical assertions.

Examples: "It's bad to cause suffering to individuals, suffering should be minimized, and pleasure maximized." "Yahweh exists." "Allah is the one true God." "Jesus was the ultimate human."
1.4.1.1.3.1. Con: -> See discussion #2649: Morality is objective.
1.4.1.1.3.2. Pro: Religion provides a unified standard basis for ethical consideration.
1.4.1.1.3.3. Con: Atheism makes no claims on morality.
1.4.1.1.4. Con: There is scientific evidence that believing the assertions of Christianity is beneficial. Therefore, Christianity is valuable.
1.4.1.1.4.1. Con: One can choose to practice these assertions without believing in any God.
1.4.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Many assertions of Christianity, including ones with empirical support, include beliefs about God and cannot be practiced atheistically.
1.4.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: For instance, that prayer helps healing. [newsmax.com](https://www.newsmax.com/Health/Headline/prayer-health-faith-medicine/2015/03/31/id/635623/)
1.4.1.1.4.2. Pro: Jesus claimed that the best way to live one's life was to love one's neighbor and in so doing you would have life and give life. There is significant [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21840289) for this claim and for the negative [consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loneliness#Effects) of failure.
1.4.1.1.4.2.1. Con: Good advice does not prove other claims made in the same book. One can learn much about heroism from "The Lord of the Rings", but this does not prove that elves exist.
1.4.1.1.4.2.1.1. Con: As JRR Tolkien was inspired by Christianity, good advice from Lord of the Rings could be construed as evidence of God's divine wisdom.
1.4.1.1.4.2.1.2. Con: The Bible makes the claim that it contains God's divine wisdom; therefore, good advice is proof of whether or not divine wisdom exists in the book.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2. Con: The idea that social behavior is preferable to antisocial behavior [predates and is not exclusive to Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule). For this reason it cannot be claimed that this proves anything about a god's existence.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.1. Con: The Bible states that there are people who know God outside of Judeo-Christianity. It follows that people before the religion would know some of its truth. For example, [Melchizedek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melchizedek) comes from outside of the central narrative of Genesis, and doesn't really return, but is nevertheless the "King of Righteousness" if you translate his name.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2. Con: Whether a god exists or not is irrelevant to whether or not one should believe in a god.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See discussion #5496: One should believe that God exists, even if they are not sure it's true.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2. Pro: It is not an empirically accepted fact that it is better to believe only in things that have been proven.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.1. Con: To believe in things that you know are not true is intellectually dishonest.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.2. Con: If the standard of what we ought to believe in has nothing to do with truth then there is no point to debating.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3. Con: Believing in things that are not true can impact decisions you make. Making these decisions with incorrect information can lead to incorrect choices. As such, it is better to maximize the amount of true information that you believe and minimize the amount of untrue information that you believe since it leads to better decision making.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1. Con: It is not an empirical fact that humans are capable of making decisions that are best for themselves.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: Modern economics shows us that humans behave irrationally.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Making decisions which are detrimental does not imply an incapability to make positive decisions.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1.2. Pro: Humans fail to make decisions that they know are correct.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1.1.1.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1.3. Pro: Humans frequently make decisions that they know will be detrimental to themselves and others.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1.1.1.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1.4. Con: If humans are not capable of making decisions that are best for themselves, then no human should decide to believe in a god.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1.4.1. Con: There are empirically right ways of making decisions, and humans can make decisions the right way. Their ability to foresee whether the decision is right or wrong is not complete, no matter how much information is provided.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: Taking one's time to make certain decisions is better than not.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: People who marry quickly are often less happy than people who wait longer to marry.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Younger marriages have the [highest](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/stellar/under-30-and-divorced-calling-time-on-failing-marriages-after-tying-the-knot-young/news-story/4431760263c3ca6fd56e12431922b5e0?nk=7e45378dc9262509315c4d61849f06e9-1531315435) rates of divorce.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Couples who date less than one year before marriage have a [much higher divorce rate](https://www.evanmarckatz.com/blog/marriage/couples-that-date-longer-stay-married-longer/) than couples who have dated for a longer time.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.2. Con: Incorrect information can lead one to make better choices than a lack of information. [Such as warnings about unknown dangers couched in legend.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Interference_Task_Force#Thomas_Sebeok)
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.2.1. Con: Warnings of unknown dangers couched in legend are better addressed by providing the information which is known rather than adding extraneous elements to it. Saying "people die in the woods" is better than saying "A monster is killing people in the woods" because it keeps options open as to why people are dying in the woods, rather than giving a specific, possibly wrong, reason.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.2.1.1. Con: Metaphysical concepts can provide psychological benefits.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.2.2. Pro: If there are dangers that are too complicated to be logically communicated by the human brain, then illogical beliefs may be needed to communicate these dangers.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.3. Con: Most choices in one's life are not clearly correct or incorrect; therefore, truly correct or incorrect decisions are rare or non-existent.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.3.1. Con: Just because we often cannot clearly judge which decision would be the correct one even in hindsight, does not mean there is no correct decision to be found.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.4. Pro: The act of believing, itself, can be pleasurable, and can outweigh the negative consequences of poorer decision-making.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.5. Pro: False belief can even lead to better decision-making, assuming religious people are [more charitable](https://www.kialo.com/kialo-should-separate-voting-into-relevance-and-strength-of-claim-20564/20564.0=20564.1/=20564.1/comments) and warmhearted than atheists, and that charity and warmheartedness are better than their absence.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.5.1. Con: There is [conflicting evidence](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11979235/Muslims-and-Christians-less-generous-than-atheists-study-finds.html) on whether religious people are more charitable.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.6. Pro: Believing in things that are not true can sometimes benefit people. See the [placebo effect](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/what-is-the-placebo-effect#1).
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.7. Con: Believing in things that are not true has been demonstrated to harm people. See cases where prayer healing is used [in place of modern medicine](http://whatstheharm.net/faithhealing.html).
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.8. Con: Believing in things that are not true can damage your credibility - especially if you know that they are not true.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.3.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.4. Pro: Believing in things which cannot be empirically proven can be good for one; indeed, this is the basis for all morality.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.3.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5. Con: If a god will affect one's life, believing in a nonexistent god instead of a true, extant god could have dire consequences.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.1. Pro: The same is true about not believing in any god.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2. Con: This is a problematic argument known as [Pascal's Wager](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager).
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1. Pro: The notion proposed by Pascal in his Wager is inherently flawed.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1. Pro: The idea that "you should believe" assumes that you have a choice over what you believe: ["ought implies can"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ought_implies_can). However, one cannot choose their beliefs, and so there is no "should" with regard to belief. \(Perhaps there is only rational or irrational.\)
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: You do not choose your beliefs through volition. You are convinced.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.1.1. Con: People can refuse to be convinced, especially when they have social support for their established belief.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.2. Pro: It is impossible for a sane person to sincerely believe in something they don't genuinely think is true, or at least do not think is false.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Many people take risks when they believe in part of a very complex notion but have doubts about other parts. God honors this kind of belief, as can be seen in the life of Abraham. He believed God enough to leave his homeland for a new land, but doubted when he became old and childless to the extent that he had a child with his wife's maid. God still honored his promise to Abraham, made when Abraham first believed, and gave him a child by his wife, among many other answered promises.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Another example may be a trust fall. A person may in general trust the people there to catch them. But may feel much doubt due to the newness of the situation. They may scream when they fall, showing their lack of total faith. But the fact that they fell shows enough faith to be caught and have an experience where faith grows. The next time they fall, they may not scream.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.3. Pro: Belief without evidence is against rational thinking.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Many positive emotions and activities are outside rational thinking; this does not mean that they do not bring benefit to the lives of those who engage with them.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Belief without evidence being irrational is not the same as emotions outside rationality. Beliefs are not emotions.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.3.2. Con: To say that there is no evidence is simply false.  Example of at least some evidence being that there is a clear [historical person known as Jesus of Nazareth.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus)
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: The eyewitnesses of Jesus's life and his resurrection have been carefully documented by men named Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and Peter. Their testimonies have been well preserved over the ages.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.2.1.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.3.2.1.2. Con: Eyewitness reports, especially those from two millennia ago, are not sufficient evidence for supernatural events. One can find eyewitness reports of almost anything, such as Bigfoot, aliens, the Loch Ness Monster etc.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.2.3.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.3.2.2. Con: -> See discussion #8515: Jesus probably did not exist as an historical person
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.3.2.3. Con: Even if there was a historical person named Jesus of Nazareth, that does not support the idea that he was a god of some kind.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.3.2.3.1. Con: We're not just referring to any Jesus of Nazareth. But Jesus of the Bible. According to the New Testament authors, Jesus claimed to be God. Since we [know Jesus existed](https://www.kialo.com/what-is-the-best-religion-to-believe-3371/3371.0=3371.13-3371.27-3371.333+3371.497), and He claimed to be God, it follows that He is God.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.3.2.3.1.1. Con: Simply claiming to be god is no evidence of being god, even if claimed by a provably real person.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.3.2.4. Pro: [Did Jesus Exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Did_Jesus_Exist%3F_\(Ehrman\)) is a book by Bart Ehrman, a leading scholar of the New Testament, writer of over twenty-five books \(including three college textbooks\) in that field of study and an agnostic. Written to counter the idea that there was never such a person as Jesus Christ at all, Ehrman sets out to demonstrate the historical evidence for Jesus' existence, and he aims to state why all experts in the area agree that "whatever else you may think about Jesus, he certainly did exist."
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.3.2.4.1. Con: The evidence presented by Bart Ehrman falls short of the conclusions he makes. [Historicity of Jesus](https://books.google.com/books/about/On_the_Historicity_of_Jesus.html?id=EWIJoAEACAAJ)
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.2. Pro: Pascal's Wager is flawed in that it proposes infinite utility gains and losses. When you introduce infinity into utility equations, it turns out that every possible action \(as long as it has the possibility, however small, of converting you\) should have an infinite expected utility value. For this reason, going to the park is just as valid a response to Pascal's Wager as going to church.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.2.1. Pro: Any fraction of infinity is still infinity. Therefore, any action that offers a non-zero chance of increasing faith can be justified, by the following equation. Value of action = probability of reward * value of reward.
The value of the reward is infinite. Therefore any non-zero value for 'probability of reward' leads to infinity for 'Value of action'.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.2.2. Con: Someone who understands Pascal's Wager to this extent is not more likely to be converted by going to church than by going to the park anyway, though. The knowledge needed to decide has been attained. And the only variable left is if this person believes or doesn't.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.3. Pro: Pascal's wager justifies the belief in Gods in general, but not necessarily the God of Christianity. If I proposed that there existed a God who would send you to super-heaven and super-hell based on your belief, then Pascal's Wager would say you should believe in that God over the God of Christianity. It does not advocate for the belief in an established God, but instead in the theoretical deity that promises the most reward/punishment.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.3.1. Con: Pascal asserts that the probability of God existing is a [50/50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager) chance. And he was taught the God of the Bible. If he were to hear of your god, the probability might lower quite a bit, thus vastly changing the wager.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.4. Pro: Pascal's Wager assumes a particular theology: one where the God rewards belief and not action. If God doesn't judge you based on your belief in him, however, any perceived gain in believing is meaningless.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.4.1. Con: In this version of the Bible, God will punish non-believers: "But the cowardly, the [unbelieving](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelations%2021:8&version=NIV), the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur."
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Despite Pascal's theology, Christianity does not describe the only God this wager could apply to.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.4.2. Con: It is a false dichotomy to say that God rewards belief but not action. God rewards both. God rewards our actions, but our actions only merit hell. "[For all have sinned](https://biblehub.com/romans/3-23.htm)" and "[the wages of sin is death](https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm)." The way out is [belief in Jesus.](https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm) So He will reward my actions by saying 'you deserve hell' but He will reward my belief by saying 'you are saved by faith in Jesus.'
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.5. Pro: God may punish feigned belief or 'tokenism' visits to religious buildings \(e.g. for considering a doubting mind in Church to be blasphemous\). This consideration changes the Wager.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.5.1. Con: The difference for punishment for this and for unbelief is relatively small. Both are eternal damnation. True belief is what brings eternal life. And considering the afterlife, including in a manner such as Pascal's Wager, can help bring someone to the point of true belief.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.6. Pro: This claim, Pascal's Wager, is countered by the [Atheist's Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist%27s_Wager).
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.7. Pro: This assumes god wouldn't be able to distinguish between a true believer and someone "believing" for personal gain,  which contradicts the assertion of an omniscient deity; God may even punish feigned belief. This consideration changes the Wager.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.7.1. Pro: In almost all religion your ability to enter the kingdom of heaven is an assessment of heart and not of mind. That is to say one must truly believe God’s existence rather than just accepting it through logical choice.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.7.2. Con: The notion that a true believer does not believe for personal gain is a false dichotomy, according to the Bible. For instance, [Romans 2:7](https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm) says that eternal life is for those who seek glory and honor and immortality. Choosing to trust that God is the source of these things gives a lot of honor to God, and is a great display of faith. \(This is also supported by [Hebrews 11:6](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-6.htm) that says those who would please God must believe that He rewards those who seek Him.\)
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.8. Pro: The Apostle Paul would have rejected Pascal's Wager. In [1 Corinthians 15:12-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A12-19&version=ESV), he argues that the Christian faith is of no value if Christ has not been raised from the dead. From Paul's perspective, there is much to be lost in this life from believing in a God that does not exist.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.8.1. Con: Paul also taught much about being patient with those of weak faith. For instance,[Romans 14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+14&version=NIV). So while he might strongly counter certain displays of doubt by certain people, as he did when the Corinthians doubted resurrection, he might not do that in all cases and it might be up to the given circumstances \(new or mature believer, culture, etc\). He might 'become like a gambler to those who gamble,' so to speak, as he strives to be "[all things to all people](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+9%3A19-23&version=NIV)."
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.8.2. Con: Even if people, who believe in a God who then does not exist, are to be pitied above all other humans, the state of humankind as a whole, if there is no afterlife, is quite [pitiable](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+12&version=NIV). This sentiment is expressed well in Pascal's Wager. Pascal loses out on 80 or so good years of living, and that is pitiable if he has no reward for it, but worth the risk to him because the reward is so great.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.2. Pro: The problem with [Pascal's Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager) is that it requires true belief. If a person does not believe in a god but still professes his faith, he is an idle worshiper, which means that not only is he not believing in a god, he is adding an additional sin.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.2.1. Con: This is not necessarily a problem because people who have faith are granted the grace of doubts. The Bible has examples of the disciple [Thomas expressing doubt](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+20%3A24-29&version=NIV) and a man expressing the nuance of faith with doubt in saying "[I believe. Help my unbelief](https://biblehub.com/mark/9-24.htm)." Therefore, a person may believe in some aspects of God but struggle with others, and God will be gracious, patient, and helpful to provide more assurance.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: God showed much patience with the disciples when they did not understand His teachings at first. For instance, they needed to be shown the miraculous feeding of [4000](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+8&version=HCSB) even after the miraculous feeding of [5000](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+6%3A30-44&version=NIV), and even then Jesus takes the time to teach them when He sees that they do not understand when they are afraid of not having enough bread in the [boat](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+8&version=HCSB) shortly after.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.3. Con: Jesus had teachings with similar sentiment, but more clarity and more detail, before Pascal did and would have more authority than Pascal since Pascal was Christian.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.3.1. Pro: Jesus [taught](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-20.htm) His followers to "store up treasure in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy and thieves do not break in a steal" instead of storing up treasure on earth, asserting that the two are mutually exclusive.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.3.2. Pro: Jesus [taught](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-29.htm) His followers that it was better to enter into the Kingdom with their eyes gouged out or their hands cut off, in order to avoid sin, than to enter hell with a whole body.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.3.3. Pro: Jesus [taught](https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm) that His followers should not fear other humans who could kill them, but instead to fear God who has power to kill and to send people's souls to hell.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.4. Con: It is only problematic if used in an unintended manner. Pascal himself said [reason is feeble compared to Scripture](http://2012daily.com/?q=node/138). So incorrectly seeing his argument as all the proof he had for the existence of God and then showing how it doesn’t prove God is a “straw man”. We must see his argument as his reason to engage Scripture in the first place. If his argument convinces to at least engage Scripture, then we must address Scripture and try to find truth or faults within it.
1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.6. Con: One should always endeavor to believe the truth.
1.4.1.1.4.2.3. Pro: The first great law to man is, "That ye love one another, as [I have loved you](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/15.12-14?lang=eng#p10)."
1.4.1.1.4.3. Pro: "A harsh word stirs up wrath" \([Proverbs 15:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+15%3A1&version=NIV)\) is a well supported claim. For example, [this research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28945441): Exposure to intergroup conflict increases meaning and fuels a desire for further conflict.
1.4.1.1.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.2.1.
1.4.1.1.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.2.2.
1.4.1.1.5. Con: Even if religion is frivolous, it is not clear that one's time should be spent elsewhere.
1.4.1.1.6. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.3.2.
1.4.1.2. Pro: There is no evidence to support the assertions of any religion.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: -> See discussion #2629: [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism) exists.
1.4.1.2.2. Con: Some Buddhist principles, practices and metaphysics are [supported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_and_science) by modern findings in Quantum Physics, Mathematics and Psychology.
1.4.1.2.2.1. Con: The fact that some parts of a religion may have real world use does not prove other parts of said religion. Each claim must stand on its own.
1.4.1.2.3. Pro: Religion, gods, and goddesses are concepts enforced by human beings, with no evidence besides man-made works. Each mythology is unproven, or else there would be only one.
1.4.1.2.3.1. Con: The fact that there are multiple mythologies does not imply that none of them have been proven. Even if one mythology has been proven, followers of other theologies could still believe in their disproven mythology because beliefs often persist long after they have been disproven.
1.4.1.2.3.2. Con: It is an assumption that religions and gods are only concepts enforced by humans, this begs the question.
1.4.1.2.4. Pro: Most religions contain contradictions and claims that can be verified as false with science. The act of believing in the falsehoods that many religions contain fills a person's head with delusions. To be Atheist is simply to be against the belief in delusions.
1.4.1.2.4.1. Con: You [can't prove](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-religion/#VerPosPosKanRel) a religion false according to Kant.
1.4.1.2.4.2. Con: Religions are only partially based on ideology, and their ideologies rarely have much to do with proof one way or another. Religions are not falsifiable \(or verifiable\).
1.4.1.2.4.3. Con: This doesn’t validly lead to atheism, only to agnosticism.
1.4.1.2.5. Pro: The philosophical burden of proof falls on the person making unfalsifiable claims. As such, if we can rationally disbelieve in [Russell's Teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot), then there isn't much of a leap to refute a Christian God, or indeed, most other religious beings.
1.4.1.2.5.1. Con: [It is possible to prove the non-existence of something](https://youtu.be/z5rtuQ34v6M), by investigating all possible instances, by showing a lack of evidence that ought to be there if it did exist, or by showing it to be self-contradictory.
1.4.1.2.5.2. Con: Russell's Teapot is meant to show that you cannot disprove the teapot's existence, not that you cannot prove its existence.
1.4.1.2.5.2.1. Pro: If a person cannot disprove something’s existence, they shouldn’t hold a view that they can. Russell’s teapot only points out the irrationality of being an atheist, it doesn’t support it. At best, it supports agnosticism.
1.4.1.2.5.2.1.1. Con: Few if any people are agnostic about whether there is, in fact, a teapot orbiting the Sun between Earth and Mars.
1.4.1.2.5.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.5.1.
1.4.1.2.6. Con: This is simply false. Many philosophical and empirical arguments have been made over time, many of which atheists still have no satisfactory response to.
1.4.1.2.6.1. Pro: [Leibniz argument from contingency](https://youtu.be/FPCzEP0oD7I) has not been resolved and disproven by philosophers.
1.4.1.2.6.1.1. Con: The [anthropic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle) justifies not needing an explanation for the universe's existence.
1.4.1.2.6.1.1.1. Con: The anthropic principle [does not remove the need of an explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQHnG07r9jw&list=PLIpO3BUiq2IFMS3AP3Yi2oDfc7pzrQs2F&index=16) for the universe's existence.
1.4.1.2.6.2. Pro: Multiple forms of the Kalam [cosmological argument](https://youtu.be/6CulBuMCLg0) have not been disproven. Current science supports the philosophical premises as well.
1.4.1.2.6.3. Pro: The [teleological](https://youtu.be/EE76nwimuT0) argument is yet to be successfully refuted.
1.4.1.2.6.3.1. Con: Fine-tuning is explained away by the [anthropic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle).
1.4.1.2.6.3.1.1. Con: The teleological argument is [not resolved by the anthropic principle.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQHnG07r9jw&list=PLIpO3BUiq2IFMS3AP3Yi2oDfc7pzrQs2F&index=16)
1.4.1.2.6.4. Pro: The [ontological argument](https://youtu.be/xBmAKCvWl74) has not been successfully refuted.
1.4.1.2.6.5. Pro: The [arguments](https://youtu.be/OxiAikEk2vU) from objective moral values and duties have not been successfully refuted.
1.4.1.2.6.5.1. Con: Whether [morality is objective](https://www.kialo.com/is-morality-objective-2649) is disputed, and if one doesn't accept that premise then one also need not accept the conclusion.
1.4.1.2.6.5.2. Con: If God does exist, morality remains subjective, there's just a very powerful being in charge of things who can punish and reward according to his own subjective morality.
1.4.1.2.6.6. Con: To be "satisfactory" is a subjective property. Any atheist who has encountered these arguments necessarily has a response that satisfies themselves, or they wouldn't be one.
1.4.1.2.7. Pro: There are standard arguments that all religions make, including belief by faith, that the doctrine claims that it is true, personal experience, and that the leaders and followers believe in the doctrine. Since these arguments are common in all religions, and not all religions can be correct, it is safe to say that these arguments are not sufficient evidence.
1.4.1.2.7.1. Con: Scientific theories are often based on the same evidence as the competing theories, often contradict each other, and claim it's the truth above others.
1.4.1.2.7.1.1. Con: Evidence can support multiple theories. However, specific evidence which points to a specific conclusion, which is demonstrable in contradictory claims is not. The pieces of evidence used in scientific theories which contradict each other are true regardless of the overall theory. Evidence such as personal experience is invalidated if the overall idea is shown to be false.
1.4.1.2.7.1.1.1. Con: Psychology is largely rooted in personal experiences. Mental illnesses are often diagnosed by the patient sharing their personal experiences with a doctor. Therefore, personal experience should not be invalidated because it can provide valuable information.
1.4.1.2.7.1.1.2. Pro: If it is true that personal experience evidence can be used to prove something that is not true, then it is not truly evidence. This is unlike evidence that is used in scientific theories because the evidence remains true regardless of the overall truth of the theory that uses it.
1.4.1.2.7.1.1.3. Con: Religious "evidence", like personal experience, may contradict that of another religion. But that doesn't make the evidence false, or the religion. Both can be wrong, but if one is right, only one can be right. The other is either lying, or has some other psychological dysfunction. This evidence however, cannot be thrown away, because it may very well be true. It simply means you cannot prove your theory on that evidence alone.
1.4.1.2.7.2. Con: You cannot dismiss something as true because it has superficial similarities to other things that might be or are false.
1.4.1.2.7.2.1. Con: The parent claim is not about superficially similar arguments, but exactly equivalent arguments made for different, mutually exclusive, religions. If you disagree that this is the case, you must argue that it is not the case.
1.4.1.2.8. Con: The assertions of Christianity are supported by empirical evidence.
1.4.1.2.8.1. Pro: One assertion of Christianity is that one should treat others the way that they wish to be treated \(a paraphrased teaching of Christ\). The validity of this claim is borne out through everyday experience when people adhere to this Christian assertion; refraining from violence yields a better world, participating in charitable causes yields a better world etc.
1.4.1.2.8.1.1. Con: This is also known as "The Golden Rule." Treating people like you want to be treated isn't just a religious statement, it's generally good advice that can be reached without using religion at all.
1.4.1.2.8.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.1.
1.4.1.2.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.1.1.3.2.
1.4.1.2.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.4.1.2.8.5. Pro: Demons [exist](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/07/01/as-a-psychiatrist-i-diagnose-mental-illness-and-sometimes-demonic-possession/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.0a0a4653b575) and can be exorcised.
1.4.1.2.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.3.
1.4.1.2.8.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.2.
1.4.1.2.8.8. Con: Taken literally, many accounts in the Old Testament are not supported by empirical evidence.
1.4.1.2.8.8.1. Pro: The literal interpretation of the creation account is incompatible with the empirical evidence for the evolution of species.
1.4.1.2.8.8.1.1. Con: The Bible contains a variety of types of literature that should be assessed for their literality individually.
1.4.1.2.8.8.1.2. Con: It is not clear that a Christian should take any story in the Bible as literally having happened.
1.4.1.2.8.8.1.2.1. Pro: Christianity has a [short history](https://www.nowyouknowmedia.com/god-and-nature-in-western-thought-from-the-dark-ages-to-the-enlightenment.html) of strict or literal interpretation of scripture.
1.4.1.2.8.8.1.3. Pro: Literal interpretation of a subject matter such as religion can be described as being rigid or fixed in its application. This means that such application is not relevant or beneficial to modern society.
1.4.1.2.8.8.1.3.1. Con: Whether or not something is 'relevant' or 'beneficial' is no reason to believe in it.
1.4.1.2.8.8.2. Con: As a Christian, there are no reasons to believe that some of the works from which the Bible is constructed were not *originally* written as fiction or as embroideries of the truth. For example, in the book of Samuel it states that David killed Goliath, but then elsewhere in the Bible it says that someone else killed Goliath.
1.4.1.2.8.8.3. Pro: There is no evidence for a global flood.
1.4.1.2.8.8.4. Pro: There is no archaeological record for The Exodus.
1.4.1.2.9. Pro: Whether or not a god exists has not been demonstrated and until it is demonstrated that one does or does not, belief should be withheld.
1.4.1.2.9.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.1.
1.4.1.2.9.2. Con: Not standing anywhere is, in practice, impossible. We have to live one way or another and the way we live displays our attitude towards God.
1.4.1.2.9.3. Con: Scientific demonstration does not preclude the existence of something. Something exists, thus demanding scientific endeavor. The scientific endeavor of whether God exists  being an undecided matter does not invalidate the possibility, nor the merit of believing in such a possibility.
1.4.1.2.9.4. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.
1.4.1.2.9.5. Pro: This is good advice, as we usually do not have to believe in things that one can just go and look through to check, like all natural phenomena.
1.4.1.2.9.5.1. Con: It bypasses the argument that God is a supernatural phenomenon, i.e. it may cause natural phenomena but not be caused \(checked\) through any of natural mechanisms \(including us\).
1.4.1.2.9.5.1.1. Con: God is affected through prayer. Most adherents believe God listens to prayers.
1.4.1.2.9.5.2. Con: Demonstrating God to civilization at large would result in a catastrophe, and would deny the agency of man.
1.4.1.2.9.6. Con: The Book of Mormon teaches otherwise by the examples of [Nehor, Korihor](https://www.lds.org/new-era/2013/03/modern-day-korihors?lang=eng), and [Zeezrom](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/zeezrom?lang=eng), all of which denounced faith and championed belief by sight.
1.4.1.2.9.6.1. Con: Sherem, Korihor, and Zeezrom are fictional characters in the Book of Mormon.
1.4.1.2.9.7. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.
1.4.1.3. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.1.
1.4.1.4. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.
1.4.1.5. Con: Atheism, in all forms, is a position on one question -- Does a God exist? -- and has no further content for any other questions of purpose or right and wrong.
1.4.1.5.1. Pro: Humanism is a superior secular system to Atheism. Humanism is a world view with values and a self-correction mechanism.
1.4.1.5.1.1. Con: Humanism is a worldview with values tacked onto atheism, where more sensible atheists disbelieve in God, subscribe to whichever ethical philosophy they believe in, and don't feel the need to connect the two.
1.4.1.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.3.
1.4.1.5.2. Pro: Atheism is not a religion. It's simply belief in the absence of God. There is no consensus determined narrative for the origin of the earth among atheists, no determined problem within the human condition, no determined means of overcoming the problem and attaining salvation, no salvation, no moral code, no traditions, no governing body etc.
1.4.1.5.3. Con: This does not mean that the position on that question is incorrect. It simply necessitates looking into other philosophies to answer those questions.
1.4.1.6. Con: Proving a negative is nigh impossible. The burden of proof is staggering to make the positive claim of atheism.
1.4.1.6.1. Con: Most atheists simply disbelieve the unsupported claims of theism rather than making a claim that there is no god.
1.4.1.6.1.1. Con: That is agnosticism, not atheism. A person who believes that should not label themselves an atheist, since they’re not.
1.4.1.6.2. Con: We believe many things do not exist whose nonexistence has not been proved in this sense. Demanding such a burden of proof in the case of God, and not in the case of, say, fairies, requires [special pleading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading).
1.4.1.7. Con: Believe in God, and upon death you either go to heaven if you're right or nothing happens if you're wrong. Do not believe in God, and you either go to hell, or nothing happens. Belief in a god risks nothing; not believing risks eternal damnation. This argument is mainly relevant to Abrahamic religions, but its core essence applies broadly - choosing the option with the only positive outcome seems logical, rather than electing into an option with only neutral or negative outcomes.
1.4.1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.
1.4.1.7.2. Con: This predicates itself on a claim of knowledge of this god's workings. If such a god prefers rational thinking over obedience, then this argument would not hold up.
1.4.1.7.3. Con: Some religions, such as [Tengrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengrism), believe that right actions matter more than which faith is followed.
1.4.1.7.4. Con: You lose time, money, and bodily autonomy if you believe in a god but none exists.
1.4.1.7.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.4.1.7.5. Con: Belief in the wrong god may be treated as worse than belief in no god.
1.4.1.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.
1.4.1.8. Con: There is no other way that the universe could exist other than God.
1.4.1.8.1. Con: The claim that the universe cannot exist without the supernatural requires evidence of the supernatural.
1.4.1.8.2. Con: There is no reason to believe that a god created the universe.
1.4.1.8.2.1. Con: God says that He created the universe.  \([Genesis 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&version=NIV)\)
1.4.1.8.2.1.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that the Bible is true or accurate.
1.4.1.8.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.8.
1.4.1.8.2.1.1.2. Con: Most indigenous societies had a "flood myth".
1.4.1.8.2.1.2. Pro: The creation account is echoed in the [Book of Moses](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/2?lang=eng).
1.4.1.8.2.1.3. Con: Claiming God exists because he said he created the universe is a circular claim: if God exists, then there is no other way that the universe could exist other than God; God says he created the universe \(Genesis 1\), so God exists.
1.4.1.8.2.1.4. Con: Finding contradictions in one's own preferred religious text and another person's religious claims is not making epistemic progress. It is just clashing baseless assertions at each other.
1.4.1.8.2.2. Con: [The Kalam cosmological argument](http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/theistic-proofs/the-cosmological-argument/the-kalam-cosmological-argument/) states that: \(1\) Everything that has a beginning of its existence has a cause of its existence. \(2\) The universe has a beginning of its existence. Therefore: \(3\) The universe has a cause of its existence. \(4\) If the universe has a cause of its existence then that cause is God. Therefore: \(5\) God exists.
1.4.1.8.2.2.1. Con: The flaw in this argument is that either god also requires a beginning and thus a cause, or things can exist without a beginning, which applies as easily to the universe as it does a god.
1.4.1.8.2.2.2. Con: The idea that the cause must be God is a supposition, and does not logically follow.
1.4.1.8.2.2.2.1. Con: An external cause of the universe must be beyond space and time and therefore cannot be physical or material. There are only two kinds of things that fit that description: either abstract objects, like numbers, or an intelligent mind. Because abstract objects are causally impotent, it follows that the creation of the universe is by an external, transcendent, personal mind. This is what most people have traditionally meant by "God." - [source](http://www.reasonablefaith.org/personal-god)
1.4.1.8.2.2.2.1.1. Con: The claim that the universe requires an external cause that cannot be physical or material is a supposition.
1.4.1.8.2.2.2.1.2. Con: The only example we have of intelligent minds is our own. There is no evidence of an intelligent mind "outside" the physical universe, or even of anything that isn't physical.
1.4.1.8.2.2.2.1.3. Con: The claim that such an intelligent mind is personal is a supposition also.
1.4.1.8.3. Pro: The reason to believe there is a God is teleologic: there must be a prime mover.
1.4.1.8.3.1. Pro: A building requires a builder. Therefore when you look at the world around you, you should conclude that it required a creator.
1.4.1.8.3.1.1. Con: The analogy between a building and the world is completely fallacious, and includes a presupposition that god exists within its formulation.
1.4.1.8.3.1.2. Con: The world existing is only evidence that the world exists. It does not point to a god in and of itself.
1.4.1.8.3.1.3. Con: Buildings have been observed to have been built. The same cannot be said for the world.
1.4.1.8.3.2. Con: The prime mover may not be considered as all-knowing as God is considered. So there may be a faulty or random prime mover, usually considered the universe / multiverse.
1.4.1.9. Con: -> See discussion #9967: Science doesn't justify [Atheism](https://www.dictionary.com/e/atheism-agnosticism/).
1.4.1.10. Con: Atheism has poorer explanations about many important aspects of life, including morality and beauty, than theism.
1.4.1.10.1. Pro: One atheistic view of morality is that it is an evolved social construct. As such, it is liable to change, perhaps even disappear. Many theistic views of morality, such as Christianity's teachings of love, are profound enough to be flexible for cultural differences, but are rooted in an unchanging and objective source - God, and are not at risk of fading away.
1.4.1.10.1.1. Con: This argument assumes that the existence of morality in itself has value. As a human social construct, morality would not exist without humans. Under such circumstances, it would be meaningless to ascribe any negative value to its absence.
1.4.1.10.1.1.1. Con: One could reasonably suspect that, in the future, humans may still exist but morality won’t \(at least not with the same values many hold so dearly\). Such thought is often expressed, to some extent, in science fiction works such as The Giver, 1984, V is for Vendetta, Fahrenheit 451, Hunger Games... In these works, without heroic intervention, important values are at risk of dying.
1.4.1.10.1.1.1.1. Con: The absence or decay of certain values or certain individual moral principles is not the same as the absence of morality. Morality itself does not disappear if moral principles within society change.
1.4.1.10.2. Pro: One atheistic view of beauty is fitness of reproduction via natural selection. Arguing reductio ad adsurdum, if an organism does not display reproductively desirable traits, their beauty is absent. Many theistic views of beauty are based on qualities deeper than reproductive traits, such as Christianity's view of Imago Dei, in which humans are beautiful intrinsically, as being created in the image of God.
1.4.1.10.2.1. Con: Many atheistic views of beauty are based on qualities deeper than reproductive traits.
1.4.1.10.2.1.1. Pro: Atheists can and do value character traits, morals and actions of individuals and ascribe "inner" beauty to human beings independently of the concept of god.
1.4.1.10.3. Con: This is begging the question, because if God does not exist, which is atheism's central claim, then theistic explanations of morality and beauty are resting on a false premise and are very poor if not completely invalid.
1.4.2. Pro: [Western Esotericism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_esotericism)
1.4.2.1. Con: It is not meant for everybody, i.e. it is not a "mass" religion. There is no authority figure whatsoever, and it relies mainly on individual pursuit, making it a bit chaos-prone to many observers.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Widespread disagreement from various esoteric believers demonstrates the logical and moral chaos of esotericism.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: There are no religions that demonstrate a consensus of belief: not Christianity, not Islam, not Judaism; none but small congregations under a strict autocratic leader.
1.4.2.1.1.2. Con: Esotericism is mostly syncretism \(an attempted amalgamation of different religions\).
1.4.2.1.1.3. Con: Esotericism is more about an ever evolving relationship with the divine than a system of belief.
1.4.3. Pro: [Humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_humanism)
1.4.3.1. Pro: Humanism requires that people think about and take responsibility for their moral actions. It does not allow for submission of moral autonomy to a superior being. It is therefore superior to religion, which gives moral commands and therefore requires moral submission.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: The rationale for morality seems lacking in a system with no authority or objective standard.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: If there is no ultimate being that defines morality then there is no meaning to moral actions, no source or rational that grounds goodness or badness.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: Autonomy may be an illusion.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Pro: Many theistic belief systems include evil powers as well as good powers. If you choose not to submit to the good power, then the evil power has control over you by default.
1.4.3.1.2.2. Pro: -> See discussion #5685: There is no free will.
1.4.3.1.3. Con: Many other religions \(e.g. Judaism, Christianity, Islam\) also require that people think and take responsibility for their actions, particularly those which have a superior authority.
1.4.3.1.4. Con: Submitting to a superior moral being requires taking responsibility for one’s actions, this is the opposite of abdicating responsibility.
1.4.3.1.5. Con: It is just as easy, if not more so, to abdicate moral responsibility in a humanist system as it is in other religious systems. \(Since there is no ultimate authority to determine or enforce moral values.\)
1.4.3.1.6. Con: -> See discussion #7738: We need religion for morality.
1.4.3.2. Pro: A defining feature of Humanism is that ideas held now can be refined, improved or overthrown in the light of better arguments or evidence. It is therefore superior to religions that are based in unverifiable revelation.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: Humanism assumes the value of humans without evidence. This idea cannot be overturned \(or else it’s not humanism\).
1.4.3.2.2. Con: Revelation is verifiable. The test of a prophet is whether their words come true.
1.4.3.2.3. Pro: Humanism relies on the power of human discussion, rationality and reason. It is an entire worldview, including values and ethics, without having to believe anything on bad evidence. It is, therefore, superior to deistic or theistic religions in that its core assertions can be verified.
1.4.3.2.3.1. Con: The assertion that there is no God cannot be verified.
1.4.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.6.
1.4.3.2.3.2. Con: The assertion that humans are improving their lives as they discuss and reason together is subjective \(without an objective definition of "good living"\) and therefore suspect.
1.4.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: It is unlikely, since humans have tended to always be polarized, that we will often agree when we discuss or be able to decide what characteristics to measure with our rationality.
1.4.3.2.3.3. Con: The assertion that improvements made in human history are independent of the concept of god within a society cannot be verified.
1.4.3.2.3.3.1. Pro: The concept of the supernatural in some form, including supernatural explanations for the consequences of our actions, is universally present in human history. We cannot know what humans will do without this concept being believed by at least some in society.
1.4.3.3. Pro: We know for a fact that humans exist. We have no similar certainty about the existence of gods.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: We know nothing for a fact, philosophically.
1.4.3.3.1.1. Con: We know that humans exist as much as we know any "fact" other than "[Cogito ergo sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_ergo_sum)" \(I think therefore I am\). It would be pointless to have any debate if we cannot use facts as we know them.
1.4.3.3.1.2. Con: If we know nothing for a fact, then we know it is a fact that "we know nothing for a fact." The parent claim is a classic paradox.
1.4.3.3.2. Con: We don't know for a fact how we ought to live together.
1.4.3.4. Con: Humanism claims moral values derive from human nature, but moral values are social constructs.
1.4.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.3.1.
1.4.3.4.2. Con: Social constructs are human nature. Through trial and error, we find social patterns that we feel are most useful and provide them a name, e.g. anarchy, indentured servitude, government, "decency". Even if they are created out of ignorance.
1.4.3.5. Con: Humanity has always and will always fail. Humans are a direct product of their environments and will form cultures accordingly as a response, and thus there is no guarantee of a consistent moral value system, peace, or sustainability.
1.4.3.5.1. Con: Failure of humanity in the absolute sense is extinction. The development of belief systems is a matter of trial and error until we can all find universal values that ensure our survival and co-existence.
1.4.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.5.1.
1.4.4. Con: Non-theistic belief systems lack the epistemological component of faith, and therefore are fundamentally distinct from religions.
1.4.4.1. Con: Human beings, theistic or not, have no choice but to believe certain things "without evidence".
1.4.4.2. Con: That doesn't mean they can't be the correct response to the question "what religion should people follow?", it just means that response is "none of them" instead of being entirely within the question's framing.
1.4.4.3. Pro: The lack of theistic belief should not attempt to fill "the void" society would otherwise assign to it.
1.4.5. Pro: [Agnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism)
1.4.5.1. Pro: We really do not know if there exists or doesn't exist a God or a higher power.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: Believing by faith in a reasonable doctrine is a better option than choosing not to believe due to a lack of conclusive evidence. Due to the complexity of life, scientific evidence of a "first cause," and the moral conscience universal to all humans, which all point to the likelihood of a God, belief in God is reasonable. Theism then also carries with it benefits of a clear rationale for the concepts of objective truth, objective morality, and an ordered universe of consistent cause and effect.
1.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.3.1.
1.4.5.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.8.
1.4.5.1.1.3. Con: "Complexity of life" is a phrase devoid of meaning. Complexity is subjective, measured with respect to an individual's perception of what is simple and what isn't. "Natural order" \(i.e. laws of physics etc.\) is neither complex nor simple, it just is.
1.4.5.1.1.3.1. Con: Complexity is not subjective to an extent where it cannot be brought up in a discussion on the origins of life and the universe. It is also not the only impressive aspect to our existence. The universe is vast. Proteins are elegant in their efficiency. And, the cell is of a complexity similar to a city. Yet it existed long before our collective minds could come up with a city. Our abilities should be taken into account. But so should the awesomeness around us for which we can’t take credit.
1.4.5.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Under a worldview based on methodological naturalism, the complexity of life and its awesomeness are in no way a manifestation of divine origin of the universe or evidence for the existence of supernatural.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Based on the information we currently have, we cannot come to a conclusion which belief is right.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: Choosing not to believe in the afterlife might be detrimental if what we do in this life affects our afterlife.
1.4.5.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.5.2.
1.4.5.3. Con: Being agnostic on whether God exists requires assigning an excessive credence to His existence than is realistic given the evidence.
1.4.6. Con: Religion can be useful psychologically and in terms of personal development, whether it is empirically true or not.
1.5. [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism)
1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.2.
1.5.2. Pro: Buddhism is an open-minded religion more interested in process and results, with a willingness to change beliefs in service to better evidence -- something almost every other religion is not willing to do.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Excellence is only achieved through the persistent chase for excellence.
1.5.2.2. Con: This just shows that Buddhism lacks what many other religions claim to have. Truth.
1.5.3. Pro: [Bhavana, Dana and Sila](https://en.dhammadana.org/dhamma/practice/liberation.htm) are the path to liberation.
1.5.4. Con: Reincarnation is not the soul's, or a being's "path" after death.
1.5.4.1. Pro: After death our physical body and soul are dead. There is no afterlife.
1.5.4.2. Pro: We achieve our final salvation, or damnation, after our physical death.
1.5.4.3. Pro: We live on in the memories of others.
1.5.4.4. Con: Reincarnation is our natural end.
1.5.4.4.1. Pro: Reincarnation is supported by [multiple studies](https://buddhaweekly.com/reincarnation-part-1/).
1.5.4.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.2.
1.5.5. Pro: Buddhism is formless and non-dogmatic. It can be an additional set of rules, beliefs, or practices to theistic, or non-theistic belief structures.
1.5.5.1. Pro: You can be a Christian-Buddhist, a Jewish-Buddhist, a Muslim-Buddhist, an Atheist-Buddhist, etc.
1.5.5.2. Con: You \(probably\) can't be a Hindu-Buddhist, because anthropologists believe Buddhism came from a sort-of reformation of Hinduism, because of the Buddha's reported distaste for the caste system.
1.5.6. Pro: Suffering is the one thing that all of humanity can identify as the problem linked to existence.
1.5.7. Pro: Buddhism offers the best moral code.
1.5.7.1. Pro: Buddhism focuses on expanding and improving one's own consciousness and being a good and healthy person all-round.
1.5.7.2. Pro: Buddhism is the only religion which holds that the [ease of human suffering](https://www.pbs.org/edens/thailand/buddhism.htm) \(war, hunger etc.\) is its principle purpose.
1.5.7.3. Pro: Buddhists strive to eliminate extremes in their lives and maintain a healthy moderation in all aspects of living. This is known as "[The Middle Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Way)", as proposed by the Buddha. By eliminating mental extremism, people who follow the middle path live in peace and equilibrium.
1.5.7.4. Pro: Buddhism is a religion of peace.
1.5.7.4.1. Pro: Buddhism [rejects](https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/essays/buddhism-on-peace-and-violence) all forms of terrorism and violence.
1.5.8. Pro: Belief in Buddhism does not require believing in a god.
1.5.8.1. Con: Humans can not achieve peace or liberation on their own, no matter how hard or long they try. We are human, we are weak, we will fail. Humans must be given freedom, given with the grace of God.
1.5.8.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.1.
1.5.8.3. Con: Buddhists [do believe](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/ataglance/glance.shtml) in god, they just don't believe in a personal god.
1.5.8.3.1. Con: While the linked website claims that Buddhism does not posit a personal god, this does not mean that they posit a god in another "non-personal" sense. Buddhist traditions do not posit the existence of a thinking deity which is responsible for the creation and management of the cosmos. Buddhist beliefs in spiritual forces or metaphysical elements of existence which are not immediately apparent do not translate into belief in a 'god' as the term and figure 'god' is commonly expressed.
1.5.8.3.2. Pro: Buddhists believe in enlightenment \(i.e. they believe that everyone can become God\). Therefore, they believe in God.
1.5.8.3.2.1. Con: Buddhist enlightenment does not involve becoming God at all.  It involves recognizing the non-existence of the self.
1.6. People should tailor their beliefs, rather than follow any specific religion.
1.6.1. Pro: Religions could each be correct on some tenets but not all. Thus possibly there is no "best" religion, but only maybe "best practices" individually from each religion.
1.6.1.1. Con: Many religions specifically cannot be followed only in part. To follow in part is not to follow it at all.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: If this is true, then only the strictest fundamentalists could be considered true followers of any faith.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Many religions are already [influenced](https://listverse.com/2013/06/30/ten-influences-on-the-bible/) by others.
1.6.1.3. Con: Many religions explicitly state that other religions are not true. It is contradictory to claim that they can all be true when some cannot coexist with others.
1.6.1.3.1. Pro: Universalism is expressly rejected by Jesus himself. [John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6&version=NIV) \(ESV\): "Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'"
1.6.1.3.1.1. Con: Jesus would certainly say that some religions are more correct than others as is evidenced by his conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well. \([John 4:1-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+4%3A1-26&version=NIV)\)
1.6.1.3.1.1.1. Con: This conversation \([John 4:1-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+4%3A1-26&version=NIV)\) makes no reference to the correctness of other religions.
1.6.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The conversation with the woman at the well absolutely discusses the correctness of religion. Paraphrasing: The Samaritans worship incorrectly \("They worship what they do not know"\) while the Jews worship correctly \("They worship what they do know"\), but they are both incorrect because they should be worshipping in spirit and in truth.
1.6.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Something being correct is binary. It does not make sense to say something is "more correct" if it is still incorrect.
1.6.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: In human understanding many things can be more correct.
1.6.1.3.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: If a man loves his wife and someone asks him how he feels about her, and he says, "I like her a lot." That is correct, but it would be more correct for him to say he loves her. Both statements are true, but one expresses what is more correct.
1.6.1.3.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: If someone dies, and I ask you why it happened, and I tell you it was because of brain trauma that might be correct, but if the person was killed because someone hit him on the head, then it would be more correct for me to say that he was murdered.
1.6.1.3.1.2. Con: If understood that Jesus was speaking for God and not for himself, then there is no contradiction.
1.6.1.3.1.3. Con: A person does not need to know Jesus to follow him. See [Romans 2:13-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+2%3A13-15&version=NIV)
1.6.1.3.1.4. Pro: If the ultimate goal is to reach the highest exaltation and Jesus says it is only by him, he is saying that taking a different path will not lead you there.
1.6.2. Pro: Believing in aspects of different religions allows an individual to have a more personal understanding of their place in the cosmos.
1.6.2.1. Con: One should not choose beliefs for whether they offer a "more personal understanding", but for whether those beliefs are true.
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: A personal understanding may or may not be actually true.
1.6.3. Pro: It is statistically unlikely that all of the claims of a single religion are true, and far more likely that true claims are scattered across different religions.
1.6.3.1. Con: If God did indeed send guidance then the Truth would be universal. There should be a core fundamental belief that runs through them all. Similarly, morals/ethics would be “universal” such that vices and virtues would be clear. Only the etiquettes and laws would change from time to time, place to place, people to people or culture to culture. If it is Truth then it should not change.
1.6.3.2. Con: If no God was revealing His one true faith, then it would be far more likely atheism was true than some scattered mix of religious traditions across the globe.
1.6.3.3. Con: The likelihood of any claim is relative to the evidence for it. If there is evidence for a particular religion being true then this increases the likelihood of any of its claims being true.
1.6.4. Con: It would require huge amounts of time and cognitive energy to pick and choose among diverse religious doctrines. It is easier and more realistic to simply pick one religion to follow.
1.6.4.1. Con: People pick and choose which doctrines to follow within their chosen religion. Expanding one’s choices wouldn’t require a significantly greater expenditure of time or energy.
1.6.4.2. Con: The ease of a choice does not mean it is the true or correct one. Thinking more about an issue often leads to a more accurate and/or compelling answer.
1.6.4.3. Con: To settle for one religion, one has to determine which is true, and since there is no consensus in this regard, to settle for one religion prematurely is not wise.
1.6.5. Con: That all religions are correct together or that one may be correct serving two masters is antithetical to the purpose of this debate.  Pluralism is not faith, but a rejection of properties of the truth as moral and good.
1.6.5.1. Con: There are religious faiths that follow this belief, such as the [Bahá'í Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith). This path is not opposing to the spirit of the debate.
1.6.5.2. Con: Many religions speak of similar issues, values, morals. With a broader perspective, these can be resolved or discussed better.
1.6.6. Con: Without an agreed upon system of morality, humans won’t be able to solve moral disputes, which is problematic when trying to create a functional society.
1.6.6.1. Con: Given that there is no one universally accepted 'true' religion, this is already the case, and thus it is better to consider one's beliefs within the concept of rationality and reason rather than to wait until one emerges as the universally 'true' religion.
1.6.6.2. Con: This assumes that the purpose of religion is to facilitate human societal flourishing in the present life.
1.6.7. Pro: Any religion, given that their teachings point to the same fundamental source, however slight the difference in terminology may be.
1.6.7.1. Pro: All religions which stress a connection with the spiritual world will, if fully comprehended, be beneficial to the individual.
1.6.7.2. Pro: Religion at its purest state is a transcendent endeavor which, in many different ways, gives a sense of purpose and meaning to the individual.
1.7. [Jainism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism)
1.7.1. Con: The Digambara Jain sect is inherently [sexist](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/beliefs/women.shtml), in that its followers believe that women cannot achieve liberation without being reborn as men first.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Some Jain texts say that menstrual blood is a sign of [impurity](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/beliefs/women.shtml) and that it kills micro-organisms, thus making women less non-violent than men.
1.7.2. Pro: The Jainist ritual of [Santhara](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/manoj-jain-md-mph/santhara-jain-way-of-death_b_8078786.html), fasting to death, teaches people how to die with equanimity.
1.7.3. Pro: Jainism offers the best moral code.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Jainism is a religion of peace.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: Jainist pacifism is absolutist - there is never a situation in which violence is held to be acceptable. This is too rigid as an ethical code, and ignores the situations where violence is morally permissible.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Jains believe that non-injury \([Ahimsā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa_in_Jainism)\) to others and oneself is the highest religious duty. It protects not just humans, but all living things.
1.7.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.3.1.1.
1.7.3.3. Pro: Jainism requires its adherents to vow to [tell the truth and never steal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism#Jain_ethics_and_five_vows).
1.8. Native/indigenous religions
1.8.1. Pro: [Shintoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto)
1.8.1.1. Pro: Shintoism has enjoyed great [longevity](https://www.ancient.eu/Shinto/), indicating its strength.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Many religious and non religious view points have survived for a long time. This is not indicative of whether or not they are true. It is indicative of their survival value in the realm of ideas, which is dependent upon many factors other than truth.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Shintoism has the best [moral code](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/shinto/shintoethics/ethics.shtml).
1.8.1.3. Pro: Shintoism promotes the belief in the interconnectedness of all things.
1.8.1.3.1. Con: One must provide evidence that this belief is justified, that the claim is true.
1.8.2. Pro: [Native American Religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_religion).
1.8.2.1. Pro: The Earth Lodge Religion was founded in northern California and southern Oregon tribes such as the Wintun.
1.8.2.2. Con: Native American people themselves often claim that their traditional ways of life do not include “[religion](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Native-American-religion)”. They find the term difficult, often impossible, to translate into their own languages.
1.8.2.2.1. Pro: The article claims that this incongruity arises from differences in cosmology and epistemology between the many diverse tribes and Western scholars.
1.8.3. Pro: [Muism/Korean Shamanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_shamanism)
1.8.3.1. Pro: Central to Korean shamanism is the belief in a supreme God and supreme mind, Haneullim or Hwanin, meaning "source of all being" and of all gods of nature.
1.8.3.2. Pro: Muism is related to Chinese Wuism, Japanese Shinto, and to the Siberian, Mongolian, and Manchurian shamanic traditions.
1.8.4. Pro: These religions carry great historical context.
1.8.4.1. Con: Although history of cultural development is interesting and valuable and ought to be preserved, it is not an argument to believe in a thing. We ought to believe in things based on whether or not we think they are true.
1.8.5. Pro: They articulate local [ecosystem details](https://www.fws.gov/nativeamerican/pdf/tek_turner-2000.pdf) that are absolutely necessary to sensitive living.
1.8.6. Pro: [Slavic paganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_paganism)
1.8.6.1. Con: Many slavic [holidays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_Native_Faith%27s_calendars_and_holidays) are forgotten, [calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_paganism#Reconstructed_calendar_of_celebrations) of celebrations is incomplete.
1.8.6.2. Pro: Slavic Pagans praise nature, which is good because it returns people to their roots.
1.9. [Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoist_schools)
1.9.1. Pro: Taoism teaches that, through peacefulness and mindfulness, we can live our lives while being heroes for each other.
1.9.2. Pro: Taoism contains a [strikingly similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism) moral code to that of Christianity \(advocating virtues like compassion, frugality, and humility\), so moral superiority cannot be argued from the Christian standpoint.
1.9.2.1. Con: Conversely, Taoism cannot be argued to be morally superior to Christianity.
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: Christianity offers the best moral code.
1.9.2.1.1.1. Con: The threat of punishment under Christianity can be argued to make it a morally inferior religion.
1.9.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Correction can be a good thing to teach about the consequences of actions. Ultimately, when a person chooses against God, it is not good for that person. Facing a consequence when such a choice is made is beneficial in that the person learns not to choose against God.
1.9.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Morally heinous acts ought to be punished.
1.9.2.1.1.1.3. Con: Other religions \(Islam, Judaism, and others\) also stipulate punishment for evil.
1.9.2.1.1.2. Con: Half of the [Ten Commandments](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments) are about God’s ego.
1.9.2.1.1.2.1. Con: These commands are meant for the good of people. They are about God's love.
1.9.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: This wouldn't pass muster as an excuse for a tyrannical monarch who put a similar excess of focus onto the [lese-majeste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A8se-majest%C3%A9) part of his legal code, so it shouldn't count here.
1.9.2.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.9.2.1.1.4. Pro: Christianity is a religion of peace.
1.9.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: The Old Testament preaches messages of peace which form the foundation of [Christian pacifism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_pacifism).
1.9.2.1.1.4.1.1. Con: The Old Testament also includes many of the worst atrocities within the bible, committed by god or the adherents of the Old Testament law itself \([Noah's Flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_flood_narrative), the [Plagues of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagues_of_Egypt), the [slaughter of the Canaanites](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/secularoutpost/2015/08/27/the-slaughter-of-the-canaanites-summary-of-objections/) and the rest of the Hebrew wars for the Promised Land\).
1.9.2.1.1.4.2. Con: Many religions claim being peaceful, but history may prove otherwise.
1.9.2.1.1.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.4.1.1.
1.9.2.1.1.4.2.2. Con: Unless the history shows doctrinal changes, the actions of believers do not mean that the religion teaches such flaws.
1.9.2.1.1.4.2.3. Pro: One example appears to be [the nature of ISIS](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/). They would consider themselves strict adherents of Islam \(some would say fundamentalists\), and their adherence to Islam seems to lead them to great violence.
1.9.2.1.1.4.2.4. Pro: Many [wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades) have been fought on behalf of Christianity.
1.9.2.1.1.4.3. Pro: Christ, whom the Christians posit is God, allowed himself to be brutally murdered by beings he could have presumably stricken down in an instant.
1.9.2.1.1.5. Pro: The Bible teaches good means of [decision making](https://lifehopeandtruth.com/life/christian-living/decision-making/).
1.9.2.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.
1.9.3. Pro: Taoism teaches to accept the nature of things as they are, rather than as we wish them to be.
1.9.4. Con: The Taoist principle of [Wuwei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei) encourages people to be inactive and not participate in world affairs.
1.10. [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism)
1.10.1. Con: Hinduism promotes the social designations of a [caste system](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35650616), which is nothing more than a means of oppressing a group of people based on the circumstances of their birth.
1.10.1.1. Con: The Hindu caste system is morally justified.
1.10.1.1.1. Pro: Hindu scripture says that the caste system should be followed, and Hindu scripture is true.
1.10.1.1.1.1. Pro: Hinduism can be proven true.
1.10.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no evidence for the existence of Hindu gods.
1.10.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: In Hinduism, the ultimate truth is not only measurable, but realizable through the discipline of ritual and regular practice.
1.10.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The first step is to prove that the Vedas, the core scriptures of Hinduism, are timeless, eternal, authorless, and true. That is done [here](http://tinyurl.com/hinduismproof).
1.10.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: One part of the argument is to demonstrate the Vedas were passed down by a beginningless tradition.  That is, everyone who has ever recited the Vedas learnt the Vedas first before reciting them.  So there was no point at which the Vedas were composed by anyone.
1.10.1.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: Another part of the argument is to deal with how it’s even possible to have an authorless text, given that the text would be written in some language, and thus the text would not be eternal if the language it’s written in was created at a certain point in time.  So part of the argument demonstrates that Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas, is an eternal language, it wasn’t created by humans at some point in human history.
1.10.1.1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Sanskrit has [historical roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit#Origin_and_development) that can be traced back to the Proto-Indo-European language.
1.10.1.1.1.1.3.3. Pro: Yet another part of the argument involves demonstrating that authorless texts are true.
1.10.1.1.1.1.3.4. Pro: Other religions start by establishing the existence of God and then using the existence of God to prove that their scriptures are true.  But Hinduism proceeds in the opposite way: it first establishes that the Vedas are absolutely authorless \(i.e. not even divinely authored\), and then it uses the fact that the Vedas say that God exists to prove that God exists.
1.10.1.1.1.2. Con: There is no caste system prescribed by Hindu scripture. The term "caste" itself is of Portuguese origin, first used by the British colonialists in the first major enumeration in India in the 19th century. The term "varna", often equated with "caste", and found in Hindu scripture, is really a "division of labour" based on "guna" or intrinsic qualities, which were three in number - Sattva \(intelligence, discipline\), Raja \(passion, initiative, organizer, leader\), Tama \(emotional, temperamental\).
1.10.1.1.2. Con: The caste system is a form of systematic [discrimination](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/india-caste-system-70-anniversary-independence-day-untouchables) and [violence](https://www.salon.com/2015/10/22/the_modern_horrors_of_indias_ancient_injustice_how_a_government_has_abandoned_millions_and_they_are_fighting_back/) that is not morally justified by modern standards.
1.10.1.1.2.1. Con: The immorality of caste-based violence does not imply that the caste system itself is immoral.
1.10.1.1.2.2. Con: Discrimination need not be a bad thing.
1.10.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: The government puts one person in the White House and another person in the jail house, but that sort of discrimination is moral.
1.10.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Actions that lead to people being elected President or committing a crime are under that person's control. The person is not in control of the circumstances of their birth.
1.10.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: The caste system is based on reincarnation - the caste a person is born into is based on actions they did in past births.
1.10.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.1.2.2.2.
1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.1.1.1.
1.10.3. Con: Hinduism teaches that all religions have some degree of right and wrong within them. There is no standard to measure truth by other than internal feelings and emotions. This is not a stable platform on which to build one's life. "It is not good to feel that my religion alone is true and other religions are false. The correct attitude is this: My religion is right, but I do not know whether other religions are right or wrong, true or false." [Vedanta Society](http://vedantaprov.org/chapter-29-the-durga-puja-festival/)
1.10.3.1. Con: -> See 1.10.1.1.1.1.2.
1.10.4. Pro: It is an holistic approach to training and disciplining body and mind with a view to allow practitioners to lead healthy, fulfilling lives.
1.11. [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity)
1.11.1. Pro: [Gnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism) Christianity
1.11.1.1. Con: Gnostic Christianity is based in Platonic thought. This begets a number of issues associated with Plato.
1.11.1.1.1. Pro: Plato believed in the Realm of Forms, yet this is antithetical to Christian thought. Christianity centralizes on Christ's death and resurrection, yet to a gnostic, the death of the body is not a meaningful phenomenon. Gnostics instead focus on secret knowledge and earning, through the mind, upper levels of heaven. Ultimately, "Gnostic Christian" is an oxymoron.
1.11.1.1.2. Pro: [Substantial forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_form), essential to Gnosticism/Plato, are dubiously proven.
1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.1.1.
1.11.3. Pro: Prophecies in Christianity have come true.
1.11.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.
1.11.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.2.
1.11.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.3.
1.11.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.4.
1.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.11.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.11.6. Con: There is no evidence to support the assertions of Christianity.
1.11.6.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.1.
1.11.6.2. Pro: It’s quite easy to imagine how the doctrines of Christianity would develop - the death of Jesus posed a threat to the claim that he was the Messiah, so Paul tried to salvage the situation by spinning the death as a good thing that was part of Jesus’ plan to save humanity.
1.11.6.2.1. Con: There is no evidence to support this assertion or, at least, less evidence than what supports historical Orthodox Christian faith - documentation, for example.
1.11.6.2.2. Con: Paul was not a follower of Jesus until after his death and resurrection. This argument would not apply to him.
1.11.6.2.3. Con: This argument may apply to Peter and the other apostles. However, there is as yet no convincing [historical evidence](https://youtu.be/dm0x40EElD8) in favour of it.
1.11.6.3. Pro: Belief in Christianity is belief in the impossible. It requires otherwise rational individuals to believe in virgin birth, resurrection and miracles.
1.11.6.3.1. Con: This is called faith. All religions require some degree of faith.
1.11.6.3.2. Con: This argument presupposes that God doesn't exist. If God existed, the impossible would be possible. Thus, the argument is circular.
1.11.6.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.3.1.
1.11.6.4. Con: The Bible has been shown to be [accurate](https://kenboa.org/apologetics/how-accurate-is-the-bible/).
1.11.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.11.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.7.
1.11.6.6. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.8.
1.11.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.4.2.
1.11.8. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.4.1.
1.11.9. Con: The concept of the Holy Trinity is directly contradictory to Abrahamic Monotheism as established by the Bible.
1.11.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.
1.11.10. Pro: [Nondenominational](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondenominational_Christianity) Christianity
1.11.10.1. Pro: Non-denominational Christians tend to practice believer's baptism, not infant baptism.
1.11.10.2. Pro: Non-denominational Christians tend to believe in baptism for the [forgiveness of sins](https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm).
1.11.10.3. Pro: Non-denominational Christians hold to no human authority structure in place of the authority of God himself.
1.11.10.4. Con: Non-denominational Christians can exist in a bubble of their own local church and not have the benefit of reading widely to challenge their own understanding of the scriptures.
1.11.11. Pro: [Unitarianism​](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarianism)
1.11.11.1. Pro: Trinitarianism is a mode of idolatry.
1.11.11.2. Pro: The bible is not infallible.
1.11.12. Pro: [Eastern Orthodox Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church)
1.11.12.1. Pro: The last surviving speakers of Aramaic, the "language of Jesus," have formed various Eastern Orthodox congregations in Syria.
1.11.13. Pro: [Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism)
1.11.13.1. Pro: All Christians should be Protestant.
1.11.13.1.1. Pro: The Eucharist is not literally the body of Christ.
1.11.13.1.1.1. Con: Many different Protestants believe in the doctrine of real presence in the Eucharist.
1.11.13.1.2. Pro: Jesus already paid for our sins.
1.11.13.1.2.1. Pro: [Romans 4:25](http://biblehub.com/romans/4-25.htm) says that Jesus died for our sins.
1.11.13.1.2.2. Con: This implies that one can sin as much as they want unapologetically and still be fine in God's eyes.
1.11.13.1.2.2.1. Con: If one sins unapologetically, then that person is clearly not repentant and therefore would not be clean of sin.
1.11.13.1.2.3. Pro: [1 John 2:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2&version=ESV) \(ESV\): "My dear children, I am writing this to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate who pleads our case before the Father. He is Jesus Christ, the one who is truly righteous."
1.11.13.1.3. Pro: Confessing sins is a matter between an individual and God.
1.11.13.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.13.1.2.3.
1.11.13.1.3.2. Con: Murder is a sin, and any local jurisdiction has the right prosecute a person for this act.  Therefore, not all sin is between God and man.
1.11.13.1.4. Pro: The Pope should not be considered authoritative.
1.11.13.1.4.1. Pro: No human being, no matter the title, is [infallible](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans3%3A10&version=NLT) when it comes to theology.
1.11.13.1.4.1.1. Con: A Prophet does not need to be perfect. All Christians claim that Jesus was the only perfect one. Jesus can use a Prophet or the Pope to lead his Church and that person would always be imperfect.
1.11.13.1.4.2. Pro: Abuse of papal authority enabled Spain \(and Columbus\) to enslave the Native American populace.
1.11.13.1.4.2.1. Pro: The [Papal Bull](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/content/doctrine-discovery-1493) issued by Pope Alexander VI in 1493 gave Spain exclusive possession of all discovered lands and [stated](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/sites/default/files/inline-pdfs/T-04093.pdf) that "barbarous nations be overthrown and brought to the faith."
1.11.13.1.5. Con: The Virgin Mary is holy.
1.11.13.1.5.1. Con: Jesus never said that the Virgin Mary was holy.
1.11.13.1.5.2. Pro: Mary was [assumed](https://web.archive.org/web/20130904181017/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html) into heaven, body and soul.
1.11.13.1.5.2.1. Con: There is no reference in the New Testament to Mary being assumed into heaven.
1.11.13.1.5.3. Con: Protestants accept holy titles for Mary such as "Blessed among women", "full of grace", "The Virgin", and "Theotokos."
1.11.13.1.6. Con: Works are required to get into heaven.
1.11.13.1.6.1. Con: The New Testament [clearly states](http://www.biblestudytools.com/romans/passage/?q=romans+3:20-24) that it is only by the grace of God that Christians are saved, through faith, and not by works or good deeds. All have sinned, and are doomed to eternal damnation. It is only through Christ's sacrifice that he took the punishment for our sin. The incredible gift of eternal life does not come with the condition of "being a good person".
1.11.13.1.6.1.1. Con: Good works are often evidence someone is a Christian.
1.11.13.1.6.1.2. Pro: The story in [Luke 23:40-43](http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/passage/?q=luke+23:40-43) captures how Jesus says to a criminal hanging on a cross right next to him: "today you will be with me in paradise". This criminal did not have a chance to do any good, yet he got into heaven.
1.11.13.1.6.2. Con: This wouldn't work in a courtroom. There is no amount of good deeds that a murderer could do to get a judge to dismiss their case.
1.11.13.1.6.2.1. Con: God's justice [mishpat](https://relevantmagazine.com/god/practical-faith/what-biblical-justice) bears no resemblance to American justice. It's based on restorative rather than retributive justice. [Restorative justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice#History) requires work to be performed to put the world back the way it belongs.
1.11.13.1.6.3. Pro: It is clearly necessary to sacrifice earthly comforts to enter the Kingdom. "I'll say it again - it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!" \([Matthew 19:24](http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-24.htm)\)
1.11.13.1.6.3.1. Con: Camels cannot enter the eyes of needles. If we need works, it is surely not our works that are necessary, but the works of a Savior.
1.11.13.1.6.3.2. Con: Whether or not someone is "rich" \(a description\) is unrelated to "works" \(an action\). One cannot believe that Jesus died for the sins of his people \(in order for them to go to Heaven upon death\), and simultaneously believe that works are necessary \(in order to go to Heaven upon death\). This would be a conflicting opinion. If eternal life is a gift \(Jesus paid for our sins on the cross\), then it would make no sense to additionally try to "pay" for our sins through works.
1.11.13.1.6.3.2.1. Con: LDS doctrine does not teach faith in things other than [Jesus Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A15&version=KJV): "If ye love Me, keep My commandments."
1.11.13.1.6.3.3. Con: The kingdom of God is not some other place that people go when they die. It is a place that exists here and now. \([Luke 17:20-21](https://biblehub.com/context/luke/17-20.htm), [Matthew 11:12](https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-12.htm)\)
1.11.13.1.6.3.4. Con: Matthew 19:24 should be read [in context with verses 25-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A+24-26&version=KJV), where the disciples are replying to verse 24 "Who then can be saved" and Jesus is answering "With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible". This is a clear indication that you cannot enter the Kingdom of God by what you do, but only with God is it possible to enter His Kingdom.
1.11.13.1.6.4. Con: Getting into heaven is completely and utterly irrelevant to the question of how we are supposed to live our lives and what it means to live out God's words.
1.11.13.1.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.4.2.8.
1.11.13.1.6.4.2. Pro: Everlasting life is not a future reward, but a state of being.
1.11.13.1.6.4.3. Pro: The Gifts of God are never for the person who receives them. They are for others.
1.11.13.1.6.4.3.1. Pro: Living water flows out from a person to nourish those around them. \([John 7:38](https://biblehub.com/john/7-38.htm)\)
1.11.13.1.6.4.3.2. Pro: A tree's fruit does not feed itself but others. \([Psalm 1](https://biblehub.com/niv/psalms/1.htm)\)
1.11.13.1.6.4.3.3. Pro: In [Isaiah 32](https://biblehub.com/niv/isaiah/32.htm), the servants of Messiah provide shelter for others.
1.11.13.1.6.4.3.4. Pro: Abraham is blessed and told he will be a blessing to all nations.
1.11.13.1.6.4.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.11.13.1.7. Con: Purgatory exists.
1.11.13.1.7.1. Pro: [Matthew 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A8&version=NIV) says only the pure of heart may see God. Since no man is clean of heart, there must be an interim between Heaven and Earth which allows you to purify your heart.
1.11.13.1.7.1.1. Con: There is no purgatory.  Earth is where God [cleans your heart](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Corinthians5%3A21&version=NLT).
1.11.13.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Protestant Christianity stresses the importance of reconciliation with god now rather than in Purgatory. This is a far less risky system because it avoids the possibility that purgatory doesn't exist \(and you just go to hell\), or that it is too late in purgatory to reconcile yourself.
1.11.13.1.7.2. Con: Paul's epistle to the Romans describes us as either dead in sin or alive in Christ. There is no middle ground or "interim goodness" by which we must strive for "complete goodness".
1.11.13.1.7.3. Con: There is no mention of interim life after first death in Scripture.
1.11.13.1.8. Con: The Catholic Church traces an unbroken line of succession back to the Apostles.
1.11.13.1.8.1. Con: The catholic church is not the same church established by Jesus Christ.  In the first [Council of Nicaea](https://www.britannica.com/event/Council-of-Nicaea-Christianity-325), the doctrine was established with no representation of Pope Sylvester I, and was overseen by Constantine I \(an unbaptized believer\).  This new doctrine claimed that God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost were all one being, but the baptism of Jesus clearly is in contradiction.
1.11.13.1.9. Con: Preceding the 16th century Reformation, there were no Protestant faiths; Christians received eternal life through the sacrifice of Christ; the eternal souls of Christians pre-dating the Reformation should not be expected to be Protestants.
1.11.13.2. Pro: The Reformation has led to a personalized relationship with God which in turn has opened the way for Western civilization to flourish and for the Catholic church to reform itself.
1.11.13.3. Pro: [Anabaptism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabaptism)
1.11.13.3.1. Pro: Anabaptists only practice believer's baptism, not infant baptism.
1.11.13.3.2. Pro: Anabaptist are usually pacifists.
1.11.13.4. Pro: [Baptist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists)
1.11.13.4.1. Con: Baptists believe baptism is for becoming a member of the baptist church, not for the [forgiveness of sins](https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm).
1.11.13.5. Pro: Protestants continue to promote a great deal of good and freedoms in the world both on the spiritual, humanitarian and socio-political levels.
1.11.13.5.1. Pro: The [Salvation Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army) is part of the Protestant Church and has outreach programs and facilities [around the world](https://www.salvationarmy.org/ihq/statistics).
1.11.13.6. Con: -> See discussion #5852: Generally speaking, evangelical Christianity improperly interprets scripture.
1.11.13.7. Con: Lutheranism is a Protestant Church, except Martin Luther said that [no church](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/16.13?lang=eng&clang=eng#p12) [should be established](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism#Lutheran_orthodoxy) [in his name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism#Church_fellowship). For if a church be called in Moses’ name then it be Moses’ church; or if it be called in the name of a man then it be the church of a man.
1.11.13.7.1. Pro: Luther insisted on Christian or Evangelical as the [only acceptable names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther) for individuals who professed Christ.
1.11.13.7.2. Con: Lutherans do not profess they are in a separate Church, but recite the same creed as the Romanists: "We believe in one, holy, apostolic, catholic Church."
1.11.14. Pro: [Catholicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church)
1.11.14.1. Con: Catholicism carries dark and harmful organizational connotations.
1.11.14.1.1. Pro: Catholic leadership is heavily associated with sexual abuse, especially of children.
1.11.14.1.1.1. Pro: One can point to the point to the [recent scandals](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/15/638690110/catholic-sexual-abuse-crisis-deepens-as-authorities-lag-in-response) as an example.
1.11.14.1.1.2. Pro: There is [significant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases) [history](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44209971) of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.
1.11.14.2. Pro: Catholic Christianity was founded by Jesus Christ. He founded the universal Christian church, from which others have split off, wanting to make their own versions. But Catholic Christianity originates in Jesus and has been in continuity with him, his apostles, and their successors since the time of Jesus.
1.11.14.3. Con: The church [is not aligned](https://churchplants.com/growth/8774-dear-church-heres-why-people-are-really-leaving-you-john-pavlovitz.html) with its followers.
1.11.14.4. Con: Catholics have been known to err on their dogmas or actions in the past and in many cases have not repented.
1.11.14.4.1. Pro: The Vatican had close ties with the ultra far-right group [Ustashe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_clergy_involvement_with_the_Usta%C5%A1e) during World War II, but has never fully acknowledged their involvement.
1.11.14.4.2. Pro: The Catholic Church [teaches](https://www.salon.com/2015/11/30/catholic_dogmas_are_killing_people_in_africa/) the sinfulness of condom use, which has contributed to high rates of HIV/AIDS in Africa.
1.11.14.5. Con: Martin Luther [argued](https://www.luther.de/en/95thesen.html) that the Roman Catholic Church was apostate.
1.11.14.5.1. Pro: Pope Francis, [commemorating the Reformation](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/5th_Centenary_of_the_Protestant_Reform.pdf), honored M. Luther and P. Melanchthon as protagonists of the reform.
1.11.14.6. Con: -> See 1.11.13.1.
1.11.15. Pro: [Mormonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism)
1.11.15.1. Con: Mormons claim the Bible as one of their Scriptures but at the same time many of their doctrines contradict many plain and precious truths found in the Bible.
1.11.15.1.1. Pro: Mormons claim the Bible as Scripture to attract Christians of other denominations \([ldsliving.com](http://www.ldsliving.com/Baptist-Minister-I-Embrace-Believe-the-Book-of-Mormon/s/81123)\). They also take certain parts of the Bible to attract non Christians [ldsliving.com](http://www.ldsliving.com/My-Name-Used-to-Be-Muhammad-One-Man-s-Journey-from-Muslim-to-Mormon/s/73825). But there are many parts of the Bible that they ignore or change.
1.11.15.1.1.1. Pro: One part that has been changed is John 1:1. Compare [lds.org](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/jst/jst-john/1.html?lang=eng) which has the Joseph Smith Translation, which reads "In the beginning was the gospel preached through the Son. And the gospel was the word, and the word was with the Son, and the Son was with God, and the Son was of God" to the myriad other translations [biblehub.com](https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm). Changing this verse makes it seem like Jesus is not God, that He has not been since the beginning, and that He did not create everything, as seen later in the chapter.
1.11.15.1.2. Pro: For instance, the Bible teaches that there are no gods other than One \([Isaiah 45:5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/45?lang=eng)\). God has always been God \([Psalm 90:2](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/90?lang=eng)\). And humans who are saved spend eternity as servants of God \([Revelation 22:3,9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/22.12)\). This contradicts Mormon doctrine commonly understood in the maxim "As we are God once was and as God is we can become."
1.11.15.1.3. Con: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is partially centered around more modern and updated doctrine.
1.11.15.2. Con: Mormonism is blatantly subject to strict gender division.
1.11.15.2.1. Pro: Women are not allowed/able to become church leaders such as bishops or presidents.
1.11.15.2.2. Pro: Some Mormon fundamentalists continue to practice [polygamy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism_and_polygamy#Remnants_within_sects).
1.11.15.3. Pro: Mormons believe in the ability to reach exaltation, which means that they will have Eternal Life, live with God, live with their family, forever, and also one day become all knowing and all powerful and become a God themselves. Having all knowledge is a promise given by no other religion. Therefore Mormonism has to be the best.
1.11.15.3.1. Con: Teaching that humans can become God is not a healthy teaching. Humans show a propensity for evil. Giving beings prone to evil a desire for more power is unhealthy.
1.11.15.3.2. Con: In the Bible, it says that charity \(love\) is better than knowledge. \([1 Cor 13:2, 8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.2)\) Therefore, promising "all knowledge" does not make a religion the best.
1.11.15.4. Pro: The chuch organization itself is the best because of the fruits or results it produces.
1.11.15.4.1. Pro: It has one of the largest [women's organisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_Society) in the world.
1.11.15.4.2. Pro: It has many missionaries worldwide.
1.11.15.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.11.15.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.
1.11.15.4.2.3. Pro: In [2017](https://www.lds.org/church/news/2017-statistical-report-for-2018-april-general-conference?lang=eng), there were 67,049 missionaries in 421 missions worldwide.
1.11.15.4.3. Pro: The church is a major source of [aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDS_Humanitarian_Services) in natural disasters and other humanitarian efforts.
1.11.15.4.4. Pro: It is the fastest growing church [in the US](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2012/08/30/mitt-romney-and-the-mormon-machine).
1.11.15.4.4.1. Con: The US is only a fraction of the world's population. Islam is the [fastest growing church](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-39279631/islam-the-world-s-fastest-growing-religion) globally.
1.11.15.4.5. Con: This church also checks the tax returns of its members to see if they are tithing.
1.11.15.5. Pro: Men are saved by [grace through faith](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/2.8?lang=eng#p3) in the Lord Jesus Christ.
1.11.15.5.1. Con: Mormon salvation requires works as well as grace through faith. \([2 Nephi 25:23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng)\)
1.11.15.5.1.1. Pro: According to Mormonism, salvation by faith requires action, through good deeds, for example.
1.11.15.5.1.1.1. Con: According to the New Testament, salvation is not by works. Good works are done as a result of salvation. \([Ephesians 2:8-10](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/2.4)\)
1.11.15.5.1.1.2. Pro: Where Christ [is](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/11.1) "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen", hope in Him should evidence itself by a substantial effort to follow His ways; and not only teach, but also do His laws. Faith is a principle of action.
1.11.15.5.1.1.2.1. Con: In Hebrews 11, not all perform actions. Sara does not perform an action. In addition, all the actions performed by the individuals who do act are different. And all are different than the actions that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints commands. The commonality is faith, and is equated to belief in [Hebrews 11:6](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/11), [Genesis 15:6](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/15?lang=eng), and [Galatians 3:6](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/gal/3.26-29). When Abraham believed, in that moment is accounted righteousness.
1.11.15.5.1.1.2.2. Pro: Faith is the [principle of action](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/11.7-9,27?lang=eng#p6) in all intelligent beings.
1.11.15.5.1.1.2.2.1. Con: In [Hebrews 11:11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/11.1), we read Sara "receiving strength" by faith \(something passive and not active\) and "judging \[God\] faithful," which is also an aspect of belief and not action. No actions are mentioned for Sara, so faith is not a principle of action.
1.11.15.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.11.13.1.6.3.2.1.
1.11.15.5.2. Pro: "Grace through Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ" is interpreted to mean men are saved by grace after all that we can do. This interpretation clarifies and does not contradict New Testament doctrine.
1.11.15.5.2.1. Con: This contradicts both Old and New Testament doctrine.
1.11.15.5.2.1.1. Pro: The Old Testament speaks of our actions \(all we can do\) as being worthless, therefore our works add nothing and are not required. \([Isaiah 64:6](https://www.biblehub.com/isaiah/64-6.htm)\)
1.11.15.5.2.1.2. Pro: The New Testament speaks of our works \(all we can do\) as being worthless. Therefore our works add nothing to salvation. \([Romans 3:20](https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm)\)
1.11.15.5.2.1.3. Pro: The New Testament puts grace and works at odds. "...if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work." \([Romans 11:6](https://biblehub.com/romans/11-6.htm)\)
1.11.15.5.2.2. Con: This teaching directly contradicts [Romans 3:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A20&version=NIV), [3:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A28&version=NIV), [10:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A4&version=NIV), [11:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+11%3A6&version=NIV), [Ephesians 2:8-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+2%3A8-10&version=NIV), [John 6:28-29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+6%3A28-29&version=NIV), [2 Corinthians 12:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+12%3A9&version=NIV), [James 4:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+4%3A6&version=NIV), [2 Timothy 1:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+timothy+1%3A9&version=NIV) \(and more\) as well as the concept of the gospel as a whole that Jesus is our full and perfect sacrifice, given to cleanse us of all sin.
1.11.15.5.2.3. Pro: Salvation after all that we can do, or Enduring to the End, champions repentance, effort, and perfection.
1.11.15.5.2.3.1. Con: Dependance on human effort leads to pride, which is morally repulsive.
1.11.15.5.2.3.2. Pro: The first [three laws of heaven](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1975/04/obedience-consecration-and-sacrifice?lang=eng) are obedience, sacrifice, and consecration.
1.11.15.5.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.11.15.5.1.1.
1.11.15.6. Pro: Joseph Smith was a prophet.
1.11.15.6.1. Con: Multiple prophecies that Joseph Smith [made did not come true,](http://coldcasechristianity.com/2014/can-we-trust-the-prophecies-of-joseph-smith/) so he is a false prophet.
1.11.15.6.2. Pro: Latter Day Saints theologians promise that readers themselves may know the reliability of Joseph Smith's prophecies by the power of the Holy Ghost.
1.11.15.6.3. Pro: Joseph Smith [prophesied](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87.8) the Civil War by about 30 years.
1.11.15.6.3.1. Con: Smith also predicted that this would become a [global war](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87.8).
1.11.15.6.4. Pro: Joseph Smith, Jr. was a Christian. The First Vision was an appearance of Jesus. "We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we [preach of Christ](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26?lang=eng&clang=eng#p25), and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins."
1.11.15.7. Pro: Mormonism offers the best moral code.
1.11.15.7.1. Con: The moral code of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints changes as the living prophet gives new prophecies. In the past, it has included illegal and immoral practices \(racial discrimination, polygamy\).
1.11.15.7.1.1. Pro: According to the Bible, the moral requirements of God do not change. \([Psalm 119:89](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/119.105)\)
1.11.15.7.1.1.1. Pro: God's moral requirements are perfection \([Matthew 5:48](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5.27-28?lang=eng)\). There are two commands, to love God and love other people \([Matthew 22:40](https://www.biblehub.com/matthew/22-40.htm)\).
1.11.15.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: No human can keep God's moral requirements, therefore God has made salvation come through belief in Jesus and forgiveness, not moral requirements \([John 20:31](https://www.biblehub.com/john/20-31.htm)\). Belief in Jesus and the accompanying forgiveness produces a life of love in those who have been saved \([Luke 7:47](https://biblehub.com/luke/7-47.htm)\).
1.11.15.7.2. Pro: LDS Christianity offers [standards](https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth?cid=YS-M-youthstrength&lang=eng) on:  accountability, dating, appearance, education, entertainment, family, friendship, gratitude, honesty, language, dancing, health, repentance, sabbaths, service, sexuality, tithing, and work.
1.11.15.7.2.1. Con: If these standards are not from God, then it is evidence of moral depravity, as humans who exert authority beyond what they have been authorized are guilty, [according to Jesus.](https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-9.htm)
1.11.15.7.2.2. Con: Many of these standards are unnecessarily restrictive or are harmful to humanity.
1.11.15.7.3. Pro: Accountability to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is wholly [compatible with accountability to governments](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/134.1-3,5,7-9,11-12?lang=eng&clang=eng#p1).
1.11.15.7.3.1. Con: The leaders of the LDS church will be held responsible if they lead their flock astray.
1.11.15.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.11.15.5.2.
1.11.15.7.5. Pro: Mormonism is a religion of peace.
1.11.15.7.5.1. Pro: Jesus Christ at His appearance is reported to have stated His doctrine thus: "he that hath the spirit of contention is not of Me, but is [of the devil, who is the father of contention](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.29?lang=eng#p27), and he stirreth up the hearts of me to contend with anger, one against another."
1.11.15.7.5.2. Con: Joseph Smith was the lieutenant general of the [Nauvoo Legion](https://history.lds.org/article/joseph-smiths-personal-effects-from-the-nauvoo-legion?lang=eng), a militia that trained in military exercises and prepared to use violence to protect the early Saints.
1.11.15.7.5.3. Con: Joseph Smith [discharged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Joseph_Smith) a revolver against the attacking mob at Carthage Jail before his martyrdom.
1.11.15.7.5.4. Con: [Captain Moroni](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/moroni-captain?lang=eng) is lionized in the Book of Mormon and in popular Mormon culture as someone who practiced just-war.
1.11.15.8. Con: Mormonism requires metaphysical claims that are logically fallacious. Insofar as logic assists in determining truth, Mormonism is illogical and therefore false.
1.11.15.8.1. Con: Joseph Smith taught a revelation saying all spirit is [matter](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.7-8?lang=eng#p6).
1.11.15.8.2. Con: LDS Christian doctrine teaches the [spirit and body](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.15?lang=eng#p14) are the soul of man.
1.11.15.8.2.1. Pro: The Book of Moses teaches all things were [created spiritually before](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.5,7?lang=eng#p4) they were naturally upon the Earth.
1.11.15.9. Con: There is no evidence to support the assertions of Mormonism.
1.11.15.9.1. Con: -> See discussion #4628: The Book of Mormon is authentic.
1.11.15.9.2. Pro: LDS Christians believe in a Holy Ghost. Understanding faith in Christ may only be accomplished by the power of this Holy Ghost. "[If ye have not the Spirit, ye shall not teach](http://classic.scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/42/14a)." Arguments in favor of LDS Christianity thus need, as a component, some evidence of the Spirit.
1.11.15.9.3. Con: The testimony is expressed every month in the LDS church by members at the pulpit. [Show me a Church​](http://californiacalcommentary.blogspot.com/2015/08/show-me-church.html) that has such testimony.
1.11.15.9.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.7.
1.11.15.9.3.2. Pro: There are 25,000+ congregations meeting once a month to allow members to bear witness/testimony of their belief.  It was done pre-social media so you cannot say that it is orchestrated worldwide.  Members are allowed to say what they want, and most choose to say that the Church is the only true Church, path to God, that God exists, that the Book of Mormon really was brought about the way Joseph Smith says it was.
1.12. [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam)
1.12.1. Pro: [Shia Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam)
1.12.1.1. Con: The Ten Commandments taught that man should not bow to idolatry.  Images produced in Iran and related nations are [aniconic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniconism_in_Islam).
1.12.1.2. Pro: The successor to the Prophet Mohammed should be passed down through hereditary succession.
1.12.2. Con: There is no evidence to support the assertions of Islam.
1.12.2.1. Pro: Islam makes unfounded claims with only Mohammad as their witness.
1.12.2.1.1. Con: Problems with this type of assertion is that it isn’t clear if it is directed at Islam or every revealed way of life. Either way, such a claim would not be unique to Islam but would apply to every way of life which believes prophets were sent by God. But also, similar to other prophets, there were witnesses to their teachings and practices - those whom they lived amongst.
1.12.2.1.2. Con: The Prophet Muhammad's \(PBUH\) credibility is verified by miracles granted to him by god.
1.12.2.2. Con: The Quran holds a lot of scientific facts that were unknown to humanity 1400 years ago and that's proof enough of it's authenticity. And since the holy book holds the words of God and it has been proven to be authentic, then that's all the evidence you need.
1.12.2.3. Pro: Islam claims to be the next step after Christianity but [denies](https://youtu.be/BcYd7U4z1os) and misunderstands the basic doctrine of the Trinity.
1.12.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.7.
1.12.3. Con: Any religion that believes in [violence](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=47&verse=4) to those who do not believe in their god or religion is not one that should be acknowledged or followed.
1.12.3.1. Con: This interpretation of Islam requires a very clear misunderstanding of [a passage](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=47&verse=4) in the Quran which specifically references violence on the field of battle as opposed to daily life.
1.12.3.2. Con: Most states condone violence on those who disagree with their laws.
1.12.3.3. Pro: [Quran 48:29](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=48&verse=29): "Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves."
1.12.3.4. Con: Islam is a religion that by no means supports violence and it's very rich in benevolent claims. It's very painful for a true Muslim to witness the atrocities happening in the world and anyone who feels the same should give Islam a chance.
1.12.3.5. Con: Bad ideas should not be battled with laws but with proper discourse.
1.12.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.12.5. Pro: Islam offers the best moral code.
1.12.5.1. Con: [Sharia law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia#Human_rights) is often criticized for being incompatible with modern ideas of human rights.
1.12.5.2. Pro: Islam is a religion of peace.
1.12.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.12.3.3.
1.12.5.2.2. Pro: Much of the violence in the Middle-East today is the fallout of Western colonialism.
1.12.5.2.2.1. Pro: The [Sykes-Picot Agreement](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2016/sykes-picot-100-years-middle-east-map/index.html) is widely considered to be the original cause of many of the region's problems.
1.12.5.2.2.2. Con: Western colonialism ended in places like Vietnam and India around the same time, but those countries do not experience the levels of violence found in the Middle East.
1.12.5.2.3. Con: -> See 1.9.2.1.1.4.2.
1.12.6. Con: Islam incentives problematic behavior with regards to women, LGBTQ people, and apostates.
1.12.7. Pro: [Sunni Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam)
1.12.7.1. Con: Sunni Islam limits the freedom of religion, conscience and speech.
1.12.7.1.1. Pro: Interfaith marriage is prosecuted, at times via vigilante killings. "[Honor killings](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/25/honor-killings-continue-pakistan-despite-new-law)" show up in the news occasionally.
1.12.7.1.2. Con: Extremists offshoots of religions are not representative of an entire faith.
1.12.7.1.3. Pro: Land of [Dar al-Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisions_of_the_world_in_Islam) is said to belong to Muslims and may not be ceded to other faiths.
1.12.7.1.4. Pro: Muslims who leave Islam are also scrutinized for blasphemy and perhaps subject to death.
1.12.7.1.4.1. Pro: At least 23 majority-Muslim countries have laws punishing [apostasy](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/apostasy/) \(including the death penalty\).
1.12.7.1.4.2. Pro: A [Pew survey](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/#how-should-sharia-be-applied) found that a majority of people in several Muslim countries who supported Sharia law also supported the death penalty for those who leave Islam.
1.12.7.2. Pro: Sunni Islam [wholly rejects](https://www.trueislam.com/home/) all forms of terrorism.
