Discussion Title: Should schools have more security?

1. Should schools have more security?
1.1. Pro: Making security personal on site, metal detectors and CCTV mandatory would harmonize security approaches across the country.
1.1.1. Pro: Many schools [already](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/education/after-newtown-shootings-schools-consider-armed-security-officers.html) have armed guards on site.
1.1.2. Pro: In matters of security, all schools, public or private, should follow the same protocol.
1.1.3. Con: The year of the Columbine High School massacre, 1999, only 19% of schools had [security cameras.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/27/how-secure-our-schools-since-columbine-they-locked-tightly-research-shows/364557002/) In 2016, 84% of government surveyed schools reported to have cameras and yet shootings at schools have not [stopped](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/02/19/parkland-school-shootings-not-new-normal-despite-statistics-stretching-truth-fox-column/349380002/).
1.1.3.1. Pro: Security cameras do not stop violence; only record it.
1.2. Pro: With security measures such as security cameras and metal detectors it will be nearly impossible to bring a weapon into schools.
1.2.1. Con: There is still a small chance that someone could somehow still bring a weapon into school.
1.2.2. Con: Assailants can try come up with new ways to kill such as using knives or vehicles to cause havoc inside schools or within their vicinity.
1.2.2.1. Pro: If less violence is enacted within schools but more violence happens in their surroundings, the problems are in no way solved.
1.2.3. Con: An [analysis](https://www.dailydot.com/via/metal-detectors-nashville-lafayette-shootings-security/) of 62 mass killings in different settings in the US, found that the prevalence of security was not a main consideration when shooters selected locations to target.
1.2.3.1. Con: The [analysis](https://www.dailydot.com/via/metal-detectors-nashville-lafayette-shootings-security/) precisely found that shooters often target places they have emotional ties to \(that is certainly the case of school shootings\). Attackers target schools because they feel wronged, not because they are easy targets, but they may reconsider if they were unable to enter with a gun.
1.2.4. Pro: If weapons are not introduced in schools, the chances of mass casualties decrease substantially.
1.3. Pro: Schools will be safer.
1.3.1. Con: schools might become too strict creating fear amongst the students
1.3.2. Pro: There will be less crimes as CCTVs and security personell can stop criminal students or other burglars immediately.
1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.3.4. Pro: Students will be able to learn with less of a chance of school shootings.
1.3.5. Con: [Research](https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/study_some_school_security_measure_make_students_feel_unsafe/) points out that extra security measures do not "decrease student misbehavior, crime, victimization or bullying".
1.3.5.1. Con: Better [mental health care](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/201803/improved-mental-health-care-won-t-prevent-mass-shootings) does not seem a good [measure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/?utm_source=Yahoo&utm_medium=Beauty&utm_campaign=kirstie-alley-las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-psychiatric-medications) to prevent school shootings either.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Adding more security is simply suppressing a problem instead of solving it \(the cause of the shootings does not originate from a lack of security personnel or equipment\). We should instead look to the root causes why shootings happen in the first place.
1.4. Pro: Adding more security can result in less school shootings.
1.4.1. Con: it create less school shootings but there will still be some school shootings
1.4.2. Pro: less school shootings means that people can focus on other important things
1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.4.4. Con: [Finland](http://newsnowfinland.fi/news-now-original/lessons-learned-ten-years-since-jokela-school-shooting) has proved that other preventive measures such as strict gun regulations, better and sooner mental heath care as well as better police training have reduced school shootings.
1.5. Con: Brick-and-mortar schools being the main line educational system should be over.
1.5.1. Con: Education needs to be in some physical space. Otherwise, some kids with bad parents will never leave the house. Also, there is a social component to school, you need to learn human interaction and make friends. Besides, it's unimaginable that any young person would pay attention to any teacher this way.
1.5.2. Con: Kids must not be constantly supervised. At least once they reach a certain age.
1.5.3. Pro: The government should repurpose the money for a brick-and-mortar school funding in favor of live webcam teaching that a student can do from their home. When a teacher can teach 30 students that are in different locations. Then the money that is saved on keeping schools open, could pay a parent to supervise their kids instead of not knowing what they're doing all day
1.6. Con: Students will feel as though they are unsafe due to all of the security measures.
1.6.1. Con: It is better to feel unsafe due to visible security measures while being safe, than to be unsafe with no security measures.
1.6.2. Pro: According to [research](https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/study_some_school_security_measure_make_students_feel_unsafe/), in fact, the more security in a school, the less safe students feel.
1.6.3. Pro: Harsh security measures tell students that schools are unsafe places were violence is [expected to occur](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-security-measures-really-stop-school-shootings/).
1.7. Con: Suggesting that schools should have more security, mainly to prevent shootings, is only a tactic to avoid gun reforms.
1.7.1. Pro: The only people who pretend to be for more security in schools, do it because they desperately want to dance around the gun issue. They would rather turn schools into prisons than agree to anything resembling even a benign and uncontroversial gun control measure.
1.7.2. Pro: There are effective measures that deal with gun control \(among other issues\) instead of just adding extra secutiry.
1.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.
1.7.2.2. Pro: Restricting minor's access to guns could help prevent school shootings, maybe more than extra security.
1.7.3. Pro: Paying for all those guards, CCTV, biometrics, etc., would cost billions and prove to be completely ineffective. Enacting sane and sensible gun control legislation would be better.
1.7.3.1. Con: Even if guns are more restrictively controlled, violence \(without guns or with knives or other 'domestic' guns\) can still be a problem.
1.7.4. Con: Assuming the purpose \(tactic to avoid gun reforms\) does not address whether adding security would or would not work.
1.8. Con: There is a small chance that there will be no effect on crime in schools.
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.2.
1.9. Con: More school security measures can cost a lot of money.
1.9.1. Pro: To fund those security measures a new tax that people will have to pay to keep this measures running may be necessary.
1.9.1.1. Con: Budgets can be balanced so an extra tax is not necessary.
1.9.2. Pro: Schools may need to dedicate parts of their budgets to security, thus under-funding other areas and likely decreasing their teaching quality and standards.
1.9.3. Con: The safety of younger generations should be more important than economical costs.
1.9.4. Con: Governments can create [grant programs](http://www.star-telegram.com/latest-news/article202156739.html) to help pay for the security measures.
1.10. Con: More security is more oppression.
1.10.1. Con: If more security achieves more safety, some oppression may be an acceptable trade-off.
1.10.2. Con: Not all security measures are necessarily obtrusive or even noticeable. Outside doors can be locked to prevent access other than through the main doors. Classroom doors can be easily secured from inside the room and can be made bullet resistant without changing their appearance. Drop down security gates can be installed above the ceilings in hallway sto limit access if a criminal does enter the building. All of these are passive and virtually undetectable, yet greatly increase security.
1.11. Con: More security can make students feel like they are in a prison, possibly causing trouble at learning and socializing.
1.11.1. Pro: Adding police or armed guards can just criminalize what is normal student [behavior](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/27/how-secure-our-schools-since-columbine-they-locked-tightly-research-shows/364557002/).
1.11.2. Pro: Kids need to grow up somewhat freely. Not just because they learn responsibility and build character this way, but also because it's just more fun. They need to run around, have secrets, break the rules. With a cop on every corner, this is impossible. Chilren today are already overly protected by their parents. Schools shouldn't do the same.
