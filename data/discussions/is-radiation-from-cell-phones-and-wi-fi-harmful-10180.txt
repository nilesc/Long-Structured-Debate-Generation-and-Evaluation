Discussion Title: Is radiation from cell phones and Wi-Fi harmful?

1. Radiation from cell phones and Wi-Fi is harmful
1.1. Pro: Cell phone radiation is [absorbed more by children's brains than by adult's brains](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?reload=true&tp=&arnumber=7335557).
1.1.1. Con: Even if this statement were proven true, it's easy to protect against since adults can decide whether or not to buy their children phones or limit their use.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Physical [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law) from radiation sources is one of the most effective ways of reducing the amount of absorbed radiation.
1.1.2. Con: The question of whether it’s absorbed more or less by children’s brains is completely irrelevant to the question of whether it is harmful. If it were proven harmful at some threshold, then this might be relevant.
1.1.3. Con: The study referenced found that the thinner skull of a child's head pass trough about twice the amount of radiation then mentioned that the amount of absorbed radiation has been found to be the same for children and adults
1.2. Con: The [main effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ionizing_radiation#Health_risks) of non-ionizing radiation on body tissue is heating, which in itself is not harmful.
1.3. Pro: Cell phone radiation causes brain cancer.
1.3.1. Con: Usage of cell phones has increased rapidly from 0% to \>90% over a few decades, while brain cancer rates [have dropped or remained the same over the same time period](http://fortune.com/2011/06/07/cell-phone-use-is-way-up-so-why-did-brain-cancer-rates-fall/).
1.3.1.1. Con: The thesis does not refer explicitly to brain cancer, but to harm in general.
1.3.1.2. Pro: The first cell phone was [sold in 1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_DynaTAC#History).  As of 2018, [95% of Americans own a cell phone of some kind.](http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/mobile/)
1.3.1.3. Pro: The [number of new brain cancer diagnoses per 100,000 people](https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/brain.html) increased from 5.9 in 1975 to 6.9 in 1985 \(when cell phones first became available\), and then dropped to 6.2 in 2014.
1.3.2. Con: Cell/Wi-Fi photons are in the GHz, which is non-ionizing radiation, far below the energy levels needed to cause DNA damage.
1.3.2.1. Con: Molecularly-damaging radiation extends below the ionizing threshold: [splitting covalent bonds in molecules and generating free radicals requires only 3-4 eV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation#Definition_boundary_for_lower-energy_photons).
1.3.2.1.1. Con: This is still [120,000 times as much energy as Wi-Fi photons](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3+electronvolts+%2F+0.02481+millielectronvolts).
1.3.2.2. Con: Non-ionizing radiation can still cause [health risks through thermal effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ionizing_radiation#Health_risks) \(like burns\).
1.3.2.2.1. Con: Although the claim is technically true, it's practically false since we can perceive and respond to the thermal increases \(ie pull the phone away when it feels hot\).
1.3.2.3. Pro: The boundary between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation is [in the ultraviolet, around 10 eV = 2 PHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation#Definition_boundary_for_lower-energy_photons).
1.3.2.4. Pro: The highest frequency used by cell phones and Wi-Fi is [6 GHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels#5.9_GHz_\(802.11p\)), which is [1/400,000th of the energy needed to be ionizing](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=10+electronvolts+%2F+0.02481+millielectronvolts).
1.3.2.4.1. Pro: You receive more \(higher-energy\) thermal radiation from everyday objects than RF radiation from cell phones.
1.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: Infrared radiation from humans delivers over 9200 times more energy per photon than cellphone radiation

[Electromagnetic value converter](https://www.translatorscafe.com/unit-converter/en/frequency-wavelength/1-19/hertz-wavelength%20in%20exametres/)
1.3.2.4.1.2. Pro: Humans emit 45 times more energy in the form of radiation than a powerful smartphone at peak transmission power

[Cellphone radiation energy and wavelength \(WHO\)](http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/electromagnetic-fields-and-public-health-mobile-phones)
1.3.2.4.2. Pro: Radiation from smartphones is weaker than sunlight, flashlights, computer monitors, TVs, car lights, and toasters in both intensity and luminosity
1.3.3. Pro: The World Health Organization [has classified cell phones as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”](http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf)
1.3.3.1. Con: The WHO has [not found](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en/) any conclusive evidence to classify cell phones as carcinogenic.
1.3.3.2. Con: The World Health Organisation categorises everything they cannot prove to be absolutely not carcinogenic nor as carcinogenic as possibly carcinogenic

[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer)
1.3.4. Con: The study that suggested this has been repeated several times and similar experiments and meta analysis have been done, but the result [could](https://www.pathophysiologyjournal.com/article/S0928-4680%2814%2900064-9/abstract) [not](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/cellphones-do-not-give-you-brain-cancer/) be replicated.
1.4. Pro: Cell phone radiation increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. [www.rfsafe.com](https://www.rfsafe.com/cell-phone-radiation-damages-blood-brain-barrier/)
1.4.1. Con: This effect has only been found to be true for sucrose \(sugar\) which is a substance that is not harmful to the brain

[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1241519/pdf/ehp0111-000881.pdf)
1.5. Pro: Cell phone radiation damages neurons
1.5.1. Pro: "Three groups each of eight rats were exposed for 2 hr to GSM mobile phone electromagnetic fields of different strengths. We found highly significant \(p\< 0.002\) evidence for neuronal damage in the cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia in the brains of exposed rats." [www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12782486)
1.5.1.1. Con: The [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1241519/pdf/ehp0111-000881.pdf) above did not find that the leakage that occurred in the brain of the tested rats was harmful to the brain \(p. 881\).
1.5.1.1.1. Con: That study also found that injecting the substance that would've leaked directly into the brains due to radiation did cause damage to the rats' brains, suggesting that the radiation might indirectly lead to brain damage.
1.6. Con: If there were evidence for any serious harm caused, phones and WiFi would not be widely available but restricted by customer protection laws.
1.6.1. Pro: Equally, companies would have been sued by customers in large, class-action cases. Such cases - if brought - have not been successful.
1.6.2. Con: companies do not care about people's health, but just about selling
1.6.2.1. Con: Dead customers can't buy phones
1.7. Pro: [Pulsed radiation produced by GSM phones is more harmful than continuous radiation produced by CDMA phones.](http://electromagnetichealth.org/electromagnetic-health-blog/gsm-cdma/)
1.7.1. Con: "More harmful" is meaningless without a magnitude.  Consider if proposition A can be shown to cause harm in 1/10,000 cases and proposition B can be shown to cause harm in 1/10,001 cases, A is by definition "more harmful" but the magnitude is still irrelevant.
1.7.1.1. Con: The study referenced in the parent claim mentioned a near doubling in radiation density for gsm over cdma. This means that twice as much radiation can be emitted from cdma devices at the same time, with radiation being more dangerous when absorbed in higher doses over a shorter period of time, than in lower doses over a longer period.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Phones [don't emit](https://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationEmittingProductsandProcedures/HomeBusinessandEntertainment/CellPhones/ucm116282.htm) enough radiation to create enough heat to be harmful or, for most modern phones, be noticeable.
