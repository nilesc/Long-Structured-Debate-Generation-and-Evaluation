Discussion Title: Justin Trudeau has failed to be a strong Prime Minister of Canada over the last three years.

1. Justin Trudeau has failed to be a strong Prime Minister of Canada over the last three years.
1.1. Con: Trudeau is [openly anti-racist](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/justin-trudeau-heckler-racist-canada-immigrants-immigration-policy-rally-a8501291.html) and has tried hard to fix the Canadian immigration and refugee system.
1.2. Pro: Trudeau's [balancing of the cabinet](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/04/canada-cabinet-gender-diversity-justin-trudeau) in terms of gender flies in the face of reason. Determining candidates by any means other than their individual merit is discriminatory.
1.3. Con: Trudeau's regime is responsible for the legalization of the recreational use of cannabis, which will lead to tens of millions in tax revenue, ultimately leading to investment in the Canadian people.
1.4. Pro: One of the main issues Trudeau was elected on was reforming the federal electoral system and making the 2015 election the last election on the first-past-the-post system. He has since [abandoned](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-abandons-electoral-reform/article33855925/) that, claiming that there is no longer a consensus on the issue.
1.5. Con: Trudeau is largely liked in the international sphere, reinforcing the positive reputation Canadians already have abroad.
1.6. Pro: Trudeau's lack of accountability in terms of his conflict of interest with his [trips with Aga Khan](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-violated-conflict-of-interest-law-with-aga-khan-trip-ethics-watchdog-says/article37393519/) are an embarrassment, and he continually dodged the question in Question Period at Parliament when asked if he had met with Mary Dawson, the Ethics Commissioner at the time.
1.6.1. Pro: Aga Khan's organization holds lobbyist status to the Canadian government and Trudeau's lack of disclosure regarding his trips to Aga Khan's private island is easily considered a conflict of interest.
1.7. Pro: The Liberals' [carbon tax plan](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-carbon-tax-debate-is-filled-with-dishonesty/) has been considered by many of the public, including Andrew Scheer and his PCs, to be a cash grab as well as outright dangerous to the Canadian People. By all accounts, the tax plan will increase costs of heating, gasoline, and more.
1.8. Pro: The Liberal Administration [scrapped](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/are-liberals-to-blame-for-cancelled-energy-projects-1.4083730) the Energy East project, leading many to the conclusion that they have all but abandoned the Atlantic Provinces to their own devices.
