Discussion Title: Fashion can never be feminist

1. Fashion can never be feminist
1.1. Pro: The fashion industry contributes to the rise of eating disorders, an issue which [disproportionately affects women](https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/women-vulnerable-eating-disorders).
1.1.1. Pro: The fashion industry perpetrates the idea of an ideal body type. When people cannot match this body type, at times they go to dangerous ends to achieve it.
1.1.2. Pro: Fashion is often developed to suit a body type that is unobtainable to most women. This makes many feel [inadequate](https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2017/may/12/female-mannequins-arent-just-skinny-theyre-emaciated).
1.1.2.1. Pro: [Social media](http://digitalmarketingmagazine.co.uk/social-media-marketing/how-social-media-and-its-influencers-are-driving-fashion/4871) and online celebrities such as the [Kardashians](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-body-blog/201603/kim-kardashian-s-style-self-esteem-is-bad-girls) heavily influence fashion and trends. Such false and unattainable images can negatively impact women's mental health.
1.1.2.2. Pro: There is a significant rise in eating disorders and [plastic surgery](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/body/cosmetic-procedures-are-on-the-rise---if-youre-considering-going/) largely due to social media and the often unrealistic beauty expectations of mainstream fashion.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Women of colour are expected to conform to a body standard invented by the '[colonial imagination](https://everydayfeminism.com/2017/05/beauty-ideals-racist/)'.
1.1.2.4. Con: This is not the case for all fashion. Fashion is often marketed using plus size [models](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/fashion/style/a48606/best-shops-plus-size-curvy/).
1.1.2.4.1. Con: The Fashion Spot [report](https://dailyillini.com/opinions/2018/01/18/fashion-industrys-representation-plus-size-models-unfinished/) cited that the appearances made by plus-size models during Fashion Week only comprised 3.46% of the total 2,601 appearances by models in 94 major New York shows. Plus size models are still vastly under represented by the fashion industry, which therefore may not yield the intended effect of reducing feelings of inadequacy.
1.1.2.4.2. Con: Although there has been an increase in fashion with body diversity. Plus sized models and their representation are still not fully accepted or welcomed with top fashion [powerhouses](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/09/vogue-accused-photoshopping-cover-make-plus-sized-model-look/).
1.1.3. Con: Eating disorders are caused by a complex intersection of [factors](https://www.bodywhys.ie/understanding-eating-disorders/key-issues/what-causes-an-eating-disorder/). It is simplistic, and unrealistic, to blame them on the fashion industry.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Often models are individuals who have been shamed for their body types. They are thus a particularly [unfair](https://www.independent.ie/style/fashion/fashion-news/fashion-week-models-are-not-to-blame-for-scourge-of-eating-disorders-31541806.html) target for blame.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Models themselves are of course not to blame. The industry is responsible for putting pressure on women, including its own models, to conform to unrealistic body standards.
1.1.3.2. Pro: [Genetic factors](https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/genetic-factors-eating-disorders) can contribute to an eating disorder. In some individuals with eating disorders, certain identified chemicals in the brain that control hunger, appetite, and digestion have been found to be unbalanced
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Increasing numbers of family, twin, and adoption [research studies](https://eatingdisorder.org/eating-disorder-information/underlying-causes/) have provided compelling evidence to show that genetic factors contribute to a predisposition for eating disorders.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Brain imaging [studies](https://eatingdisorder.org/eating-disorder-information/underlying-causes/) have shown that people with eating disorders may have altered brain circuitry that contributes to eating disorders.
1.1.3.4. Con: While the fashion industry may not be the only reason for eating disorders, it is clear that it contributes to unrealistic body ideals in people with and without eating disorders.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: In [1998](https://eatingdisorder.org/eating-disorder-information/underlying-causes/), a researcher documented the response of adolescents in rural Fiji to the introduction of western television. This new media exposure resulted in significant preoccupations related to shape and weight, purging behaviour to control weight, and negative body image.
1.1.3.4.2. Pro: When attempting to solve a problem within society, it is necessary to target all causes of it even if they are only partial causes. For example, one way to target access to education is to reduce the costs of it; this does not mean that bias in admissions processes should not also be tackled.
1.1.4. Con: In recent years due to fashion and social media there has been a rise in [men suffering](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/18/are-more-men-getting-eating-disorders) from body dysmorphia and eating disorders.
1.1.5. Con: In recent years the fashion industry has taken a number of steps to combat the issues within the fashion world such as unrealistic body-types and underweight models.
1.1.5.1. Pro: A [charter](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a43664/lvmh-kering-ban-size-zero-models/) was created by LVMH and Kering in which famous brands promise to no longer hire size zero models, models under 16 or any model who cannot provide a medical cert showing they are fit to work. They also pledge to provide a dedicated psychiatrist or therapist during working hours for their employees.
1.1.5.2. Pro: In recent years, brands have [increasingly](https://www.glamour.com/story/plus-size-models-beauty-ads) begun to use plus-size models and more models of colour in their campaigns.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: The number of plus-size models in campaigns is still [vanishingly](https://mic.com/articles/191117/fashion-spot-ad-campaign-diversity-plus-size-models-decline-again#.iUFhvmFia) small.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Fashion bosses from Paris, Milan, New York and London took part in a [debate](https://www.ctvnews.ca/fashion-industry-vows-to-tackle-eating-disorders-1.226350) on how to address eating disorders
1.2. Pro: The fashion industry is classist. As women are [disproportionately poorer](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2008/10/08/5103/the-straight-facts-on-women-in-poverty/) than men, this classism hurts them more than it hurts men.
1.2.1. Pro: In order to meet the ideal body image set forward by the fashion industry, one has to buy expensive designer-label clothes.
1.2.1.1. Con: High street fashion offers affordable clothes which fit just as well as expensive designer labels. Expensive designer fashion filters down into more accessible versions in the high street for the public to purchase.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: High street fashion has a [lower](http://www.hitthefloor.com/lifestyle/fashion/difference-quality-designer-high-street-dresses/) quality of tailoring and often has issues with the finishing of items. As sizes tend to be scaled up or down from a mid-point, unless the wearer happens to be that happy mid-point, the fit of the item will be poor.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: Low cost clothing often are of a [lower quality](https://karalane.com/smart-people-dont-wear-fast-fashion-high-end-designer-clothes/). In order to sell these items at a lower price the production costs have to be kept lower and so quality of fabric suffers.
1.2.2. Pro: The fashion industry encourages people to use [high-priced cosmetics](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/dec/10/luxury-brands-behind-gloss-same-dirt-ethics-production) and obtain costly [surgeries](https://www.surgery.org/consumers/plastic-surgery-news-briefs/plastic-surgery-runway-york-fashion-week-1052309).
1.2.2.1. Con: [Researchers](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/02/15/mental-health-problems-worsen-after-cosmetic-surgery/) found that people who opted for cosmetic surgery had a history of mental health issues. Therefore it can be argued that people who opt for cosmetic surgeries is not as a consequence of the fashion industry, but rather poor mental health.
1.2.3. Con: Fashion is accessible for all classes. Fashion comes in many forms ranging from high-end to high street. Many[budget](https://m.primark.com/en/our-ethics/how-primark-keeps-prices-low) clothes shops cater to low income families.
1.2.3.1. Con: These budget shops, in order to be able to sell clothing at a cheaper price, will buy lower quality clothing \(in terms of material, design and so on\). Thus they do not offer the best options for people.
1.2.3.2. Con: Branding is an incredibly important part of the fashion industry. To buy something from a brand that is perceived to be fashionable requires spending significant amounts of money.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: The vast majority of time and resources at major fashion shows around the world are devoted to high-value, luxury fashion brands.
1.2.4. Pro: The '[fast fashion](https://www.rte.ie/eile/brainstorm/2018/0321/948976-the-high-cost-of-fast-fashion/)' industry exploits workers in awful conditions in order to mass produce fashion trends.
1.2.4.1. Pro: In China, [70%](https://www.clb.org.hk/en/content/70-percent-women-factory-workers-guangzhou-sexually-harassed) of women workers in Guangzhou’s factories have been sexually harassed, a survey by a labour rights group in the city has found.
1.2.4.2. Pro: As many as [90%](https://brandongaille.com/36-shocking-sweatshop-statistics/) of workers in sweat shops around the globe are female. The fashion industries reliance on cheap labour cannot be considered feminist.
1.2.4.3. Pro: The Clean Clothes Campaign estimates that [80%](https://cleanclothes.org/issues/gender) of garment workers are women. These workers face awful working conditions, and regular harassment and assault.
1.2.4.4. Con: This is not universally true. Many [brands](https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/affordable-ethical-fashion-brands) pride themselves on ethical and fair production.
1.2.5. Pro: A [study](https://www.complex.com/style/2016/03/pink-tax-women-mens-clothing-prices) by the Business of Fashion found that an item of women's clothing is sold at a much higher price than a similar item made for men.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Valentino, Gucci and Dolce and Gabanna all sold identical items at different prices based gender, with women being charged up to a [$1,000](http://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/why-fashions-pink-tax-means-women-pay-more) more
1.3. Con: Fashion is a form of art like any other. It would be ludicrous to suggest that any other type of art was inherently not feminist.
1.3.1. Con: Fashion is intrinsically bound up in the fashion industry, which routinely [mistreats](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12817440/models-sexual-assault-stories-fashion-industry/) women.
1.3.1.1. Con: Abusive industries do not make the forms of art around which they are based inherently abusive.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The film industry is [rife](https://www.refinery29.uk/2017/10/176150/melissa-silverstein-women-hollywood-gender-inequality) with misogyny, but powerful [feminist](https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-feminist-films) films nonetheless exist.
1.3.2. Con: Fashion being art is a contestable statement.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Fashion is inherently commercial in nature while art is not.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: The fashion industry is heavily dependent upon a capitalist business model. It [pretends](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/20/fashion-express-youreslf-pity-vogue-models) to sell free choice, but actually is conventional.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The same could be said of iTunes or Spotify, which rely on capitalist business models but provide music, which is commonly accepted to be art.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: The vast majority of art has been commercialised in some way - novels, films, paintings and theatre are all marketed for profit.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Artists like [Andy Warhol](https://99designs.co.uk/blog/famous-design/andy-warhol-commercial-illustrator/) have demonstrated the interplay between commerce and creativity in the production of art, for example by using technology to mass produce their works.
1.3.2.2. Con: Trying to limit the definition of art results in only art which is socially accepted being defined as art. This shuts out alternative forms of art which can often offer previously unused artistic techniques and messages.
1.3.2.3. Con: The definition of art evolves constantly. Styles of art used during the Renaissance are vastly different to art created today.
1.3.2.4. Con: Fashion is about creativity and imagination, therefore it is art.
1.3.2.4.1. Con: Science requires creativity and imagination but we don't put it in the same category as art.
1.3.2.5. Con: Fashion is created to be beautiful, and is often inspired by other forms of fine [art](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/jul/13/art.artsfeatures1). It can be argued that these are two indicators that fashion itself is art.
1.3.2.6. Pro: Clothing has historically mostly existed as a necessity. Fashion has either been the realm of royalty or in modern times, of large corporations. Since it has always been done by a minority of people, it is hard to call it art.
1.3.2.6.1. Con: Most forms of art are dominated by [wealthier](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/23/middle-class-people-dominate-arts-survey-finds) [individuals](https://news.artnet.com/market/do-you-have-to-be-rich-to-succeed-as-an-artist-403166).
1.3.2.6.2. Con: It is true that most clothing is not art, but fashion is distinct from functional 'clothing', just as instruction manuals are distinct from literature.
1.3.2.7. Pro: Art generally has deeper meaning. Fashion only exists to sell clothes.
1.3.2.7.1. Con: Fashion is an important method of [self-expression](https://www.forbes.com/sites/learnvest/2012/04/03/what-your-clothes-say-about-you/#388a37806699) by the person wearing it.
1.3.3. Pro: The message from art comes from the artist, not the method that is used to convey their message. Paints themselves are not racist, however how they are used by an artist can convey a [racist message.](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180312-the-racist-message-hidden-in-a-masterpiece)
1.3.3.1. Pro: This is precisely why fashion can be feminist - the political content of art is not determined by its medium. Fashion can therefore be feminist or misogynist, depending on its creator.
1.3.4. Con: [Misogynistic](https://www.artspace.com/magazine/interviews_features/art-politics/the_picasso_problem_why_we_shouldnt_separate_the_art_from_the_artists_misogyny-55120) and anti-feminist art is not only possible, but [common](http://www.anothermag.com/art-photography/10840/five-female-futurists-who-thrived-during-arts-most-misogynistic-movement).
1.3.4.1. Con: The fact that misogynist art is common does not render those art forms inherently misogynist.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: All art forms can be used for good and bad political purposes, just as film can be used both for [racism](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150206-the-most-racist-movie-ever-made) and for [critiquing](https://variety.com/2017/film/news/jordan-peele-get-out-systemic-racism-1202604824/) racism.
1.3.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.
1.3.5. Pro: Fashion is a means of non-verbal [communication](http://fashionmedium.blogspot.com/2010/02/fashion-as-communication.html). Whether it is feminist or not depends on what is being communicated.
1.3.6. Con: What about schools of painting, sculpture and architecture from which women were banned for hundreds of years? You cannot separate the art from its history and context.
1.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.4. Pro: The fashion industry is racist. No industry which is damaging to huge numbers of women of colour can be feminist.
1.4.1. Pro: The industry casts [very few](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/fashion/claims-of-model-abuse-and-racist-casting-roil-fashion-week.html) models of colour, preferring to promote white women.
1.4.2. Pro: Racist scandals surrounding the products of prominent clothing designers are [commonplace](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/hm-racism-fashion-industry/).
1.4.3. Con: There are trends within the industry [fighting back](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-45508232) against racism.
1.4.3.1. Con: Model and activist Naomi Campbell has said that the industry has become [more racist](http://thebritishblacklist.co.uk/racism-in-the-fashion-industry-is-still-a-glaring-problem/) over the course of her career, not less.
1.4.3.2. Pro: While racism is incompatible with feminism, neither racism nor misogyny are permanent or unsolvable problems - the present racism of the industry does not mean it can never be feminist.
1.4.4. Con: This is due to racism that exists within society in general and is not specific to the fashion industry.
1.4.4.1. Con: Beauty standards that are set by the fashion industry, tend to focus on white women, [harming women of colour](https://mic.com/articles/143873/women-of-color-point-out-the-big-problem-with-white-beauty-standards#.VeMBsKi3p).
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Photoshop is often used by fashion magazines to [lighten](https://www.kqed.org/pop/102572/in-a-post-black-panther-world-can-skin-lightening-finally-stop) the skin of models of colour.
1.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.1.
1.4.6. Pro: The New York Magazine [interviewed](https://www.fastcompany.com/90226152/why-racism-is-so-entrenched-in-the-fashion-industry) more than 100 black people in the fashion industry - many of whom were women - who claim that they have experienced subtle or institutionalized forms of racism.
1.5. Pro: Fashion reinforces patriarchal stereotypes on women's appearance, e.g. high heels, shaved legs, low necklines.
1.5.1. Pro: High-heels are an expensive and an uncomfortable item in a woman's wardrobe and can cause long-term nerve damage to feet. Yet [73%](https://www.fastcompany.com/40556015/meet-the-women-reinventing-the-high-heel-without-the-sexism) of women wear them and 39% do so everyday.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Many of the famous [high-heel](https://www.fastcompany.com/40556015/meet-the-women-reinventing-the-high-heel-without-the-sexism) brands are associated with male designers who cater to the male's perspective on how they want a woman to look.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Women have been [sent home from work](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/11/receptionist-sent-home-pwc-not-wearing-high-heels-pwc-nicola-thorp) for not wearing high heels.
1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.5.3. Con: A new [metro-sexual](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/style/metrosexuals.html) style of fashion emerged in the last decade, where men are becoming equally fashion conscious. Like women, they are also under pressure to look good and live up to unrealistic standards.
1.5.3.1. Con: Simply because men are also facing pressures that women do does not mean that fashion does not harm women and therefore can never be feminist.
1.5.4. Pro: From a young [age](https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/clothes-maketh-the-gender-stereotypes-20170223-gujgpu.html), fashions aimed at girls are brighter, and focus on these such as butterflies and kittens, subconsciously reinforcing a delicate conception of femininity.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Girls are increasingly exposed to hyper sexualisation through media and [fashion](https://www.livescience.com/14249-girls-clothing-sexualized.html). Disturbingly girls younger than ever want to appear sexy and dress older than their age. Butterflies and kittens are a thing from the past, now they want to dress like teenagers and young women in their twenties.
1.5.4.2. Pro: This furthers a stereotype that women should look meek, and [weak](https://aeon.co/amp/classics/to-end-patriarchy-woman-must-first-seize-power-over-herself). In this way it perpetuates inequality.
1.5.5. Con: Many brands use models with non-stereotyped bodies. Representation is important. Maybe separate mainsteam industry from smaller brands.
1.5.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.
1.5.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.
1.5.6. Con: Embracing femininity is not anti-feminist. Rather, embracing femininity by donning high heels, shaving the legs and preferring low necklines can be a political act against the patriarchy because it demonstrates a person's love of womanhood and how it looks on them.
1.5.6.1. Con: This is only true if the decision to do things such as wear high heels is a non-coercive one made freely and without societal pressure to do so.
1.5.6.2. Pro: Fashion can be empowering.
1.5.6.2.1. Pro: Liking the outfit one wears and how one looks can make them feel good about themselves.
1.5.6.2.2. Pro: Many parts of the fashion industry encourage people to [choose](http://zanita.com/2018/03/how-fashion-affects-your-self-confidence/) an outfit or look which is individual to them.
1.5.6.2.2.1. Pro: Feminism is about giving women the option to choose their appearance without social consequences.
1.5.6.2.2.1.1. Pro: Choosing a fashion sense and appearance can be empowering and a powerful way to express one's identity.
1.5.6.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Certain modes of dress can be used to [express](https://www.refinery29.com/2018/05/200131/gay-men-clothing-fashion-lgbtq-experience) one's sexual identity.
1.5.6.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: [Research](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/minds-business/when-clothing-style-influences-cognitive-style.html#.WTmBucaZNBw) has shown that the way one dresses can affect how they think and improve performance in certain situations. One [study](https://www.inc.com/molly-reynolds/research-shows-that-the-clothes-you-wear-actually-change-the-way-you-perform.html) found that professional attire increases abstract thinking.
1.5.6.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: Fashion can be expressive of one's ethnic or religious [identity](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/fashion/islamic-fashion-vogue-arabia.html).
1.5.6.2.2.1.2. Pro: Fashion is an individual's choice. How one decides to dress depends on their personal tastes and what influences them. Today there is so much choice and less restrictions on what is considered to be fashionable.
1.5.6.2.2.1.3. Pro: Given that women have a less [autonomous](https://www.bustle.com/articles/83853-11-reasons-fashion-and-feminism-dont-clash-because-apparently-this-is-still-up-for-debate) position in society, having the choice to wear the clothing you want and determine your own aesthetic without being shamed or ridiculed is a very feminist philosophy. So, encouraging women to wear what they want and embrace the fashion of their choosing without judgement is in line with feminism.
1.5.6.2.2.1.4. Con: Fashion is understood in terms of norms or even [rules](https://www.popsugar.co.uk/gdpr-consent?destination=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.co.uk%2Ffashion%2FFashion-Rules-2018-44467071%3Futm_medium%3Dredirect%26utm_campaign%3DUS%3AIE%26utm_source%3Dwww.google.ie). It creates expectations that women must follow.
1.5.6.2.2.1.4.1. Pro: The role of fashion [critic](http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/who-are-critics-reviews-actually-meant-for-in-2017) formalizes the practice of evaluating what others wear.
1.5.6.2.2.1.4.2. Pro: Fashion has often been used as a way for men to [control](https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/reports/timeline-of-dress-codes-men-telling-women-what-to-wear-295043) what women wear.
1.5.6.2.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: Outfits are often designed to make women appear in such a way which conforms to men's opinions on how women appear attractive to them.
1.5.6.2.2.1.4.2.1.1. Con: Dressing in such a way that makes someone appear attractive can be powerful and an embrace of one's sexuality.
1.5.6.2.2.1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Dressing according to someone else's aesthetic ideals can never be empowering.
1.5.6.2.2.1.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: All art involves the promotion of particular aesthetics, and nobody can make aesthetic choices in a vacuum. The fact that fashion promotes certain norms does not mean that women cannot make autonomous choices about what to wear.
1.5.6.2.2.1.4.2.2. Con: This may have been true historically, however the emphasis within fashion now is for women to choose outfits which they themselves enjoy.
1.5.6.2.2.1.4.3. Con: Trend setters often break mainstream rules, creating their own original ideas of fashion which then people become attracted to and want to emulate.
1.5.6.2.2.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.5.6.2.2.1.4.2.1.1.1.1.
1.5.6.2.2.1.4.5. Con: -> See 1.5.6.2.2.1.2.
1.5.6.2.2.1.4.6. Con: Rules are reinvented and changed [constantly](https://womens-fashion.lovetoknow.com/womens-fashion-history/how-do-fashion-trends-start). Fashion is a way in which people can express themselves and so change these norms.
1.5.6.2.2.1.4.6.1. Con: A change of rules still means that they are present and therefore forcing people to abide by them. Rather, a quickly changing fashion industry means consumers are expected to keep up with it more vigorously rather than having freedom.
1.5.6.2.2.1.4.7. Pro: Following fashion demonstrates a willingness to conform to the norms of your community. It is a statement of [subjugation](https://www.bustle.com/articles/94811-where-do-fashion-trends-start-why-people-care-about-whats-in-style-and-what-it-really).
1.5.6.2.2.1.4.8. Con: Fashion is a form of art, creativity and self expression, where rules can be broken. Throughout the decades women have used fashion as a [feminist tool](https://www.crfashionbook.com/culture/a22736609/feminist-style-evolution-history/) to challenge and push the limitations of gender.
1.5.6.2.2.1.5. Pro: Dictating what women should wear or not wear is exactly what a patriarchal society does. Women should be free to choose.
1.5.6.2.3. Pro: Multiple [studies](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-clothing-choices-affect-and-reflect-your-self-image_b_9163992) have demonstrated that clothing affects one's mood.
1.5.6.2.4. Con: Empowerment can come in multiple ways.
1.5.6.2.4.1. Con: The fact that empowerment comes in many forms does not make empowerment derived from fashion less legitimate.
1.5.6.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.2.2.1.4.2.1.1.
1.5.6.2.6. Pro: The development of new fashions has often served to actively liberate women.
1.5.6.2.6.1. Pro: The bikini has been credited with giving women an opportunity to [express](https://thecatchallblog.com/2015/01/26/who-says-it-has-to-be-modest-a-feminist-perspective-on-the-bikini/) their sexuality without shame.
1.5.6.2.6.2. Pro: The bloomer dress, [popularised](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/when-american-feminists-were-pilloried-for-daring-to-wear-bloomers) in the 1850s, was also known as the 'freedom dress' because it increased women's ability to move with ease and comfort.
1.5.7. Con: Men have [always](https://www.forbes.com/sites/drsarahbond/2016/08/31/a-short-history-of-regulating-female-dress/) imposed patriarchal rules dictating how women can dress. They did not originate within the fashion industry.
1.5.7.1. Con: However the fashion industry represents a way by which individuals commercialise and profit from this patriarchal activity.
1.5.7.2. Pro: Many men feel that it is acceptable to [catcall](https://metro.co.uk/2017/10/05/dear-dudes-catcalling-and-talking-to-women-are-not-the-same-thing-6978956/), and comment on women's clothing. This is a result of misogyny and a lack of respect, it has nothing to do with fashion trends.
1.5.8. Pro: Deodorant was [introduced](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-advertisers-convinced-americans-they-smelled-bad-12552404/) and targeted towards women by making body odors, which were accepted as being normal, to be seen as something disgusting and un-womanly.
1.5.9. Con: The outdated patriarchal stereotype of how a women should look no longer restricts women's fashion. Modern fashion has evolved to offer an array of diverse styles allowing women the freedom to dress the way they want to.
1.5.10. Pro: Highly popular fashion shows such as [Victoria's Secret](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/07/my-agents-told-me-to-stop-eating-the-reality-of-body-image-in-modelling) adheres to patriarchal stereotypes of "being sexy". Such shows perpetuate harmful sexist ideas of women and unrealistic body images.
1.5.10.1. Pro: Not only does the narrow and unrealistic view of women damage the [self-esteem](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/07/my-agents-told-me-to-stop-eating-the-reality-of-body-image-in-modelling) of many normal women but can also negatively impact those working in the industry who are trying to uphold such extreme beauty expectations.
1.5.11. Con: Many [leading](https://www.glamour.com/gallery/women-owned-fashion-brands) fashion brands are owned by women, and designed with women's [comfort](https://www.glamour.com/story/and-comfort-affordable-plus-size-clothing-brand) in mind.
1.5.11.1. Con: Many fashion trends sacrifice the comfort, and even the safety of the women who are encouraged to wear them.
1.5.11.1.1. Con: The existence of fashion trends which are harmful to women, which is indisputable, is not evidence that fashion can never be feminist. Fashion can be used for both regressive and progressive purposes.
1.5.11.1.2. Pro: High heels make women who wear them less mobile and thus more [vulnerable](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/heels-female-vulnerability-nicola-thorp-feminist).
1.5.11.1.2.1. Con: The use of heels has evolved from a time when men also wore them, and they signified power. Thus, they were intended to create the opposite effect.
1.5.11.1.2.1.1. Con: The initial intent of designers in the [10th](https://www.today.com/style/surprisingly-functional-reason-high-heels-were-invented-t100969) century does not change the effect that heels have on women who wear them today.
1.5.11.1.2.2. Pro: Wearing heels may also cause back, knee, and hip [pain](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/high-heels-can-be-causing-back-knee-and-hip-pain-and_us_59042f84e4b084f59b49f946).
1.5.11.1.3. Pro: Corsets, which were popular for many centuries [directly](https://www.cnet.com/news/vintage-x-rays-reveal-the-hidden-effects-of-corsets/) had a negative impact on women's bodies.
1.5.11.1.3.1. Pro: Despite the fact that the negative effects of corsets are widely known, due to the fashion industry they have [re-emerged](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/a-waist-of-time-the-contemporary-revival-of-the-corset-a7020911.html) as a trend and encouraged people to engage in dangerous [waist training](https://www.elitedaily.com/p/are-waist-trainers-bad-for-you-heres-what-experts-have-to-say-about-them-2889800) activities.
1.5.11.1.4. Pro: Chinese [foot-binding](https://allthatsinteresting.com/chinese-foot-binding) mutilated the feet of women who practiced it and started doing so at a very young age.
1.5.11.1.4.1. Con: Foot binding is a body modification practice distinct from the fashion industry.
1.5.11.1.5. Pro: Even trends like [Female genital mutilation](http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/female-genital-mutilation) are arguably an offset of fashion as they dictate how a woman's genitalia must look.
1.5.11.1.5.1. Con: [FGM](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/what-is-fgm-everything-you-need-to-know-about-female-genital-mutilation-9580935.html) mainly takes place due to cultural and religious reasons rather than for any aesthetic purpose. The procedure is believed to reduce a girl's libido and prevent the possibility of premarital sex.
1.5.11.2. Con: Women can reinforce patriarchy too.
1.5.11.2.1. Pro: The fashion world is [notorious](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11405232/Bitches-Women-are-worse-than-ever-wheres-the-sisterhood-gone.html) for being a competitive and unforgiving place where women are not particularly kind to each other.
1.5.11.3. Pro: [Coco Chanel](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988494,00.html) was a pioneer in empowering women through fashion, she endeavoured to free women from their constraining and unpractical clothes.
1.6. Con: -> See 1.5.6.2.2.1.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.5.6.2.
1.8. Pro: The Fashion industry upholds the gender pay gap, whereby women are paid less than their male counterparts. The fact that the fashion industry is complicit in this practice suggests that the fashion industry can never be feminist.
1.8.1. Pro: The middle market women’s wear brand Karen Millen pays women [49% less](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/fashion/uk-fashion-companies-gender-pay-gap.html?smid=tw-share) than men on a median hourly basis.
1.8.2. Pro: Popular fashion brand Victoria’s Secret was found to have had a median hourly rate gap of [19%](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/fashion/uk-fashion-companies-gender-pay-gap.html?smid=tw-share).
1.8.3. Pro: Benefit Cosmetics was revealed to have a [30.7%](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/fashion/uk-fashion-companies-gender-pay-gap.html?smid=tw-share) median hourly rate gap, despite the fact that women made up more than 90 percent of each pay quartile at the company.
1.8.4. Pro: At Burberry, where women make up 70% of the luxury fashion group’s employees, there is a [26% gender pay gap](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/fashion/uk-fashion-companies-gender-pay-gap.html?smid=tw-share) in favor of men, who get higher bonuses too.
1.9. Con: Fashion can be feminist in the future.
1.9.1. Pro: The rise of [body positivity](https://www.teenvogue.com/gallery/plus-size-fashion-body-positive-2017-highlights) within the fashion industry could indicate a change in the way the industry is acting.
1.9.1.1. Con: Whilst this rise exists, it is still a minority view within the industry.
1.9.1.2. Con: This rise has only come in response to how the fashion industry was repressive in the past.
1.9.2. Pro: Fashion surrounding gender norms is changing; in the past it wasn't socially acceptable for women to [wear jeans,](https://viva.media/gender-in-the-fashion-industry) something which is no longer the case. Similar changes can come in the future.
1.9.3. Con: Fashion depends on women feeling inadequate, in order for them to spend money on the latest products and clothing to feel better about themselves. As a result it is unlikely that the fashion industry will ever become truly feminist since this would mean a huge loss in profit.
1.9.3.1. Pro: The fashion industry is a business with a priority to make money. [Consumerism](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/issue-millennials-isn-t-narcissism-our-depressing-culture-mass-consumption-ncna839331) is heavily dependent on human insecurities and flaws; encouraging us to spend more money in order to feel better about ourselves.
1.9.3.1.1. Pro: Because fashion relates to a person's image and how they are viewed, it is particularly likely to cause insecurity.
1.9.3.1.2. Pro: Fashion advertisements often portray people what is perceived to be a 'more successful' lifestyle than most viewers of these advertisements.
1.9.3.2. Con: It is perfectly possible for people to buy products without feeling bad about themselves. The majority of consumer goods do not rely upon insecurity for sale.
1.9.4. Pro: Now more than ever there is an awareness of gender inequality and its related impact on society. In order to keep modern and youthful, fashion like many other industries has to evolve and adapt to the times, including socio-political ideas.
1.9.5. Pro: Fashion’s ultimate direction \(feminist or otherwise\) rest in the hands of agnostic market forces—and the market will promote whatever sells. If feminist ideals want to succeed in this Byzantine industry, the cause should focus on labor rights & fashion education.
1.9.6. Con: Even if fashion was to change in the future, the effects it has had on people would not disappear. Feelings of inadequacy, eating disorders and the effects of sweatshop labour in parts of the world would not disappear.
1.9.6.1. Con: [Body positive](http://stylecaster.com/body-positive-fashion-brands/) and [sweatshop free](http://stylecaster.com/body-positive-fashion-brands/) fashion can and do exist.
1.10. Pro: Feminism is being subsumed by fashion only for marketing reasons.
1.10.1. Con: Even those who suspect that fashion brands are simply motivated by [profit](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/04/are-fashion-and-feminism-compatible-lagerfeld-chanel), do admit that this motivation has lead to a decrease in high heels, and an [increase](http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/why-more-brands-are-embracing-plus-size-models-170984/) in plus size models and clothing being marketed. Regardless of intent, this is positive for feminism.
1.10.2. Pro: Feminism has become a popular [brand](https://medium.com/\@laurenbtt/branding-feminism-the-commodification-of-a-social-movement-883a4291f89c) in recent years, encouraging fashion houses to use basic feminist imagery and slogans with little regard for actual political content.
1.10.3. Pro: [Celebrities](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/26/feminism-music-business-branding-beyonce-kesha) are now keen to jump on the band wagon, turning the once embarrassing stigma attached to feminism into a cool and trendy statement. The world of show business and fashion often crossover, this new superficial marketing take on "feminism" has filtered down into fashion and vice versa.
1.10.3.1. Pro: This new wave of hollywood/fashion "feminism" could be considered as devoid and hypocritical, with fashion icons including [Beyonce](https://www.thefader.com/2016/10/07/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-beyoncs-feminism-comment) adopting "feminism" as part of her identity and brand. Yet these are the same people who have greatly benefited from using their bodies and sexuality to boost their career.
1.10.3.1.1. Pro: Big stars in the public eye influence women's fashion and play a part in [perpetuating](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/admire-beyonc-for-her-music-not-her-feminist-credentials-8562463.html) sexism in mainstream media and fashion. Ultimately they reinforce that a woman's worth is largely dependent on appearance, material possessions and their relationship with men.
1.10.3.2. Con: Celebrities can be utilized as a productive resource in order to popularize feminist ideals given their popularity and mass fan base. Whether they truly believe in feminist values, or have simply jumped on the band wagon, their espousal of feminist values will only serve as a benefit to the spread of the values which feminism stands for.
1.10.3.2.1. Pro: Celebrities have made concrete contributions to progressive causes, for example by establishing the [Time's Up Legal Defense Fund](https://nwlc.org/times-up-legal-defense-fund/) to support survivors of sexual assault.
1.10.4. Pro: 'Feminist fashion' is often a branding exercise to appeal to young women rather than a genuine political movement.
1.10.4.1. Pro: Brands often capitalise on events such as [International Women's Day](https://www.refinery29.com/2018/03/192766/international-women-day-fashion-brands-to-support-2018) to sell products, while donating little of their proceeds to feminist causes.
1.10.4.2. Pro: Clothing lines such as Ivy Park, which have been [praised](https://www.topshop.com/blog/2018/03/ivy-park-favourite-feminist-sports-brand) as feminist, often abuse women via [exploitative](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2017/02/04/beyonce-clothing-line-sweatshop/) labour practices.
1.10.4.3. Con: Branding is a powerful tool to market feminist values.
1.10.4.3.1. Pro: According to [research](https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/young-people-big-appetite-purpose-driven-brands-channel-4-survey-finds/1488556), 57% of young people believe brands should use their advertising to raise awareness of social or ethical issues, and 60% of consumers overall say any brand can start a conversation about important issues. Hence branding can be utilized as a powerful tool to spread feminist values.
1.10.4.3.2. Con: The majority of brands are still run by men \([with only 14% run by women](https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/study-the-fashion-industry-is-still-run-by-men.html)\) who are less likely to use the industry to convey feminist messages.
1.10.4.3.2.1. Pro: Given men do not have the life experiences of women, they are less likely to be aware of feminist issues and therefore less likely to use their brand to promote them.
1.10.4.3.2.1.1. Con: One does not have to directly experience or endure a reality of discrimination in order to appreciate it's significance. It's like saying one has to be poor in order to appreciate the hardship of poverty. Therefore, one does not have to endure the reality of sexism in order to appreciate the hardship of those who endure it, and support the feminist causes that seek to eliminate their hardships.
1.10.4.3.2.2. Con: Often times the creative decisions are not made by the people running the company but by teams at a lower level. These teams can promote a feminist message if they choose to.
1.10.4.3.2.3. Con: If the CEOs of fashion companies are interested in profit and their customers are increasingly more feminist, then they are likely to use their industry to send a message which meets the interests of their customers.
1.10.4.3.2.4. Pro: Irrespective of whether a message sent is feminist or not, an industry which is majority controlled by men can never be feminist. Its existence involves women being discriminated against in the workforce.
1.10.4.3.3. Con: Businesses exploit their workers in order to market their brands, rendering the concept of branding as a tool to market feminist values counter-productive.
1.10.4.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.10.4.4. Con: Regardless of initial intent its reach is still positively influencing a large range of people and creating change within the fashion industry itself.
1.10.4.4.1. Pro: In recent times, due to increased publicity, changes have taken place in order to combat abuse in the fashion world.
1.10.4.4.1.1. Pro: Casting directors for Balenciaga were [fired](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/news/a40175/balenciaga-lanvin-model-mistreatment-controversy-james-scully/) following an accusation of mistreatment of a number of models.
1.10.4.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.10.4.4.1.3. Con: New policies driven solely by bad publicity are unlikely to be genuine or lead to lasting changes.
1.10.4.4.1.3.1. Con: The evidence of #MeToo suggests that public outcry is often [fleeting](https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a20710282/men-planning-me-too-comebacks-harvey-weinstein/), allowing perpetrators to return to positions of power once the spotlight has died down.
1.10.5. Pro: The Fashion industry has a long history of advertisers alluding to sexual violence against women for commercial advertising.
1.10.5.1. Pro: In 2007, Dolce & Gabbana released an [advert](http://time.com/3093670/indias-gang-rape-plague-violence-against-women-for-fashion/) depicting a gang rape.
1.10.5.2. Pro: In 2010, Calvin Klein Jeans released an [advert](http://time.com/3093670/indias-gang-rape-plague-violence-against-women-for-fashion/) in Australia that was banned for being 'suggestive of violence and rape.'
1.10.5.3. Pro: Vogue Italia did an entire spread on [domestic violence](http://time.com/3093670/indias-gang-rape-plague-violence-against-women-for-fashion/) in, featuring a women about to be brutally murdered while cowering over a small text identifying the Marc Jacobs she is wearing.
1.10.5.4. Pro: According to the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women), 35% of women worldwide have experienced partner violence or non-partner sexual violence. Beautifying this violence against women in the glossy pages of a magazine - finding sexy elements in a sexually violent act - is an appropriate medium for a public service announcement.
1.10.5.5. Pro: A French advertising watchdog was urged by campaigners to ban sexually provocative posters amid claims that they [incite rape](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/mar/06/saint-laurent-ad-campaign-porno-chic-france).
1.10.5.6. Pro: Indian photographer [Raj Shetye](http://time.com/3093670/indias-gang-rape-plague-violence-against-women-for-fashion/) published an image in a fashion spread called The Wrong Turn, which depicted an Indian woman fending off groups of men on a bus, causing immediate outrage on social media from women’s rights activists.
1.10.6. Con: -> See 1.10.4.3.
1.10.7. Pro: -> See 1.5.11.1.
1.10.8. Con: If the marketing of fashion can endorse and spread feminist values, it does not matter.
1.10.8.1. Con: If the primary concern of the mechanism through which feminist values are spread is to yield a profit, then the feminist values - however sound they may be - may be undermined. As a consequence, people will not take feminism seriously hence the manner in which feminist values are spread does matter in order to preserve the integrity of feminist values.
1.10.8.1.1. Pro: The widespread adoption of feminism as a matter of fashion or coolness can dilute its actual political content, as people adopt feminist symbols for reasons other than the political.
1.10.8.1.2. Pro: Companies propagating feminism for profit will always choose the latter over the former when it comes down to it.
1.10.8.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.4.2.
1.11. Pro: The fashion industry is abusive to women who work in it.
1.11.1. Con: A rise in ‘[feminist](https://eluxemagazine.com/fashion/feminist-fashion-brands/) fashion’ not only promotes equality, but in addition many feminist brands are also ethically sourced supporting women from developing countries.
1.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.10.4.
1.11.2. Con: The "Me Too" movement has impacted many male-driven industries, [exposing](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/24/terry-richardson-photographer-dropped-fashion-brands-allegations) the everyday abuse and reality women face. Hopefully this will improve the conditions longterm for women who work within such industries.
1.11.2.1. Con: Others argue that the fashion world is still waiting for its "Me Too" [moment](https://metro.co.uk/2018/04/27/fashion-industry-still-waiting-metoo-moment-7500869/). Largely unregulated, the industry is built upon young female bodies. It seems highly unlikely that there are not some sordid secrets awaiting public disclosure.
1.11.2.1.1. Pro: Sexual assault is [rife](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a15174585/fashion-sexual-harassment-testino-richardson/) within the industry.
1.11.2.1.1.1. Pro: Emboldened by the #MeToo movement, more than [50 models](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/02/16/beauty-and-ugly-truth/c7r0WVsF5cib1pLWXJe9dP/story.html) spoke to the Globe Spotlight Team about sexual misconduct they experienced on the job, from inappropriate touching to assaults.
1.11.2.1.2. Pro: Although the MeToo movement has helped highlight unequal treatment of women in the fashion industry, It is evident that backwards attitudes still remain. For example, Karl Lagerfeld, one of fashion’s most prominent and iconic figures, declared his exasperation towards the #MeToo movement, urging models to [“join a nunnery”](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/karl-lagerfeld-slams-the-me-too-movement-models-that-complain-about-being-groped_us_5ad49b6ae4b0edca2cbbfedd?guccounter=1&guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZGFpbHliZWFzdC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi13b3JsZC10dXJucy1pdHMtYmFjay1vbi1tZXRvby1lbWJyYWNlcy1hbGxlZ2VkLWFidXNlcnMtcm9uLWplcmVteS1yb21hbi1wb2xhbnNraS1hbmQtbW9yZQ&guce_referrer_cs=mTHFsTEcxLD-DHPjOqFm3g) if they don’t want to be sexually harassed.
1.11.2.1.3. Pro: Given that it has been a year since the original #MeToo movement developed, it is very possible that the momentum has now dissipated and there will be no such disruption within the fashion industry.
1.11.2.2. Pro: The "Me Too" movement inspired The Model Alliance to create the [Respect Program](https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/25/models-back-the-respect-program-to-tackle-sexual-abuse-in-fashion-7577248/). This is a concrete plan of action for changing the culture of the industry to reflect the values of respect and professionalism, and protecting models from abuse
1.11.3. Con: -> See 1.10.4.4.1.
1.11.4. Pro: Terry Richardson, an American fashion and portrait photographer - who despite a slew of [sexual harassment](https://jezebel.com/why-im-finally-speaking-up-about-what-terry-richardson-1591353414) allegations - continues to get work with some of the biggest fashion publications in the world, thus putting women who work in the fashion industry at risk.
1.11.5. Pro: Eating disorders are [commonplace](https://www.vogue.com/article/model-alliance-eating-disorder-study) amongst fashion models.
1.11.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.10.1.
1.11.5.2. Pro: Models report being objectified and disrespected regularly. This compounds the physical risks of complying with weight expectations, leading to 67% of models demonstrating anorexic symptoms. [Bogár, p.16 and 9.](http://www.netzwerk-essstoerungen.at/download/k16_presentations/V26_Bogar_251016.pdf)
1.11.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.11.7. Pro: Despite women dominating entry level jobs in fashion, they are [vastly](https://www.instyle.com/news/fashion-industry-gender-problem-interviews) underrepresented in top level positions.
1.11.7.1. Con: This is true of the workforce in [general](https://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/women-workforce-uk), and not specific to fashion.
1.11.7.2. Con: At [14%](https://www.instyle.com/news/fashion-industry-gender-problem-interviews), the percentage of female executives in the fashion industry far outstrips the [overall](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/8/17413254/women-fortune-500-ceos-politics-blue-wave) average of 4.8% amongst Fortune 500 companies.
1.11.7.3. Con: The existence of large numbers of women in entry-level jobs could indicate that the industry is changing over time, with women primed to gain top-level positions as their seniority increases.
1.11.7.4. Pro: This is a direct result of gendered stereotypes. Women are seen as less innovative or [pioneering](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-luxury/article/2093000/why-fashion-industry-still-has-so-few-women-top-despite), in an industry that prizes fresh approaches.
1.11.7.5. Con: Although often a problem, this is not universally the case, and is becoming less and less true.
1.11.7.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.11.
1.12. Con: Fashion can convey feminist messages.
1.12.1. Con: Despite a rising awareness of diversity and body image in the public, mainstream fashion and media continues to relay a [misogynist](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/mar/06/saint-laurent-ad-campaign-porno-chic-france) message through brands and advertisement.
1.12.2. Pro: Fashion, by virtue of endorsing new trends and setting new cultural norms, upholds feminist values of choice.
1.12.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.6.2.2.1.4.
1.12.3. Con: -> See 1.10.4.3.2.
1.12.4. Pro: Fashion shows have been used to highlight and support feminist causes.
1.12.4.1. Pro: During the fall of 2017, the [fashion community](https://www.glamour.com/story/me-too-new-york-fashion-week-fall-2018) pinned pink Planned Parenthood buttons to their lapels and sent protest T-shirts down the runway during the New York Fashion Week, highlighting feminist causes.
1.12.4.2. Pro: Fashion designer Prabal Gurung closed one of his fashion shows with a parade of models walking without music en masse to the photographers’ pit [carrying white roses](https://www.sfchronicle.com/style/article/Prabal-Gurung-The-most-woke-runway-of-New-York-12617242.php), a sign of solidarity with #MeToo that was also used at the Grammys.
1.12.4.3. Pro: Fashion shows have been used to [protest](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/12/acid-attack-survivors-laxmi-and-adele-bellis-take-the-catwalk-in-london-fashion-show) violence against women.
1.12.4.4. Pro: [Chiara Ferragni](https://www.harpersbazaararabia.com/fashion/the-style/diors-feminist-t-shirt-is-the-only-top-you-need-this-season) wore Dior's feminist T-shirt in sign of support.
1.12.4.4.1. Pro: Maria Grazia Chiuri's “We should All Be Feminists” [T-shirt](https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/maria-grazia-chiuri-interview) was created for Christian Dior’s in 2017, an explicit example of fashion waving the flag for feminism.
1.12.5. Pro: Women have worn pink ['pussy hats'](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/thousands-are-knitting-pussy-hats-for-the-womens-march-on-washington_us_586bb22ee4b0d9a5945c636a) en masse to protest misogyny in recent years.
1.12.6. Pro: Fashion has often been a core element of progressive, feminist social movements.
1.12.6.1. Pro: The Suffragette movement used [fashion](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/m.huffingtonpost.co.uk/amp/entry/fashion-as-a-feminist-tool_uk_5a95864ee4b0f2c735654d74/) in order to let their feminist intentions be known to society. They wore purple for loyalty and dignity, white for purity, and green for hope.
1.12.6.1.1. Pro: The suffragette movement adopted fashion as a mechanism to demonstrate that women define for themselves what it means to be a woman. As a consequence, the [power of dress](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/m.huffingtonpost.co.uk/amp/entry/fashion-as-a-feminist-tool_uk_5a95864ee4b0f2c735654d74/) was an important tool that influenced their standing in society, helping them towards less oppressive gender norms thus furthering feminist ideals.
1.12.6.2. Pro: The #MeToo movement has influenced the way fashion is utilized in order to further feminist values.
1.12.6.2.1. Pro: Celebrities wore black at a Golden Globes event to stand in [solidarity](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/movies/times-up-golden-globes-red-carpet.html) with survivors of sexual assault in a continuation of the #MeToo movement.
1.12.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.2.
1.12.6.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.12.4.2.
1.12.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.12.5.
1.12.6.4. Con: Fashion has also often put unfair expectations on women and endorsed patriarchy.
1.12.6.4.1. Con: Fashion doesn't have to be patriarchal. For example, women can choose what part of their body they want to show off or cover up; focus on a style that is feminine, masculine, or none of the above purely based on their own expectations that they have defined for themselves, rather than patriarchal reasons such as fulfilling the expectations of men.
1.12.6.4.2. Pro: Ideal body sizes were long endorsed by the fashion industry as many women struggled to meet the expectations and be thin and curvy at the same time.
1.12.7. Pro: Fashion helps break gender norms.
1.12.7.1. Pro: An interest in fashion has conventionally been described as a ["girl thing"](https://www.bustle.com/articles/83853-11-reasons-fashion-and-feminism-dont-clash-because-apparently-this-is-still-up-for-debate). However, men also have an interest in fashion, which helps break the stereotype that fashion is only something women have an interest in. Hence, fashion is a great way to break gender norms which is the goal of feminism.
1.12.7.2. Con: The majority of fashion still espouses traditional gender norms. Whilst some changes have been positive, the overall trend in the industry cannot be ignored.
1.12.8. Pro: Fashion can be used to point out inequalities when it comes to appearance and gender.
1.12.8.1. Pro: Women are given all kinds of mixed messages about how they should look, and judged for how they dress when men aren't - making fashion a huge window into how modern day sexism looks.
1.12.8.1.1. Pro: One [survey](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/10385501/Bosses-admit-they-would-discriminate-against-women-not-wearing-makeup.html) found that more than two thirds of bosses \(67%\) would take a dim view of female staff not wearing make-up at key business meetings. This impacts employees as two thirds of female staff said they would feel much less confident if they were at a high-level meeting without cosmetics on.
1.12.8.2. Pro: Female political candidate Hilary Clinton was judged on her merit based on her [appearance](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/19/AR2007071902668.html), devaluing her work experience as a politician.
1.12.8.2.1. Pro: Women are often judged in the workplace based on their appearance. In a [survey](https://www.recruiter.com/i/in-2018-professional-women-are-still-judged-by-their-appearances/) 61% of company executives admitted that female staff who did not wear cosmetics on a regular basis were less likely to receive promotions.
1.12.8.2.2. Con: There is a clear distinction between judging someone on their appearance, which takes many forms unrelated to clothing, and fashion, which is a specific art-form. The existence of misogynists who will denigrate women's appearances no matter what does not render fashion politically useless.
1.12.8.2.2.1. Con: Whether art can be feminist or not is judged based on it is presently feminist rather than whether it has the potential to be.
1.12.8.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.9.
1.12.9. Con: Fashion is interpreted by those viewing it through the norms of society. It is likely to be interpreted in a way that does not challenge that society.
1.12.9.1. Pro: Often those who wear more revealing clothes are judged and [unfairly shamed](https://www.bustle.com/articles/83035-7-reasons-to-stop-shaming-women-who-wear-revealing-clothing-your-ideas-of-propriety-aside) by society. Their credibility is undermined rather than their fashion being respected.
1.12.9.2. Con: Fashion provides the women who wear it with [confidence](https://www.vogue.com/article/intelligent-design-how-clothing-affects-the-mind). How they view it is the most important factor.
1.12.9.2.1. Con: Fashion also has the potential of having the opposite effect as women who can't fulfill fashion requirements and have ridiculously thin bodies are more likely to face self esteem issues.
1.12.10. Pro: Top models such as [Gisele Bündchen and Cara Delevingne](http://www.allmyfriendsaremodels.com/is-fashion-feminist/) walked down the runway, supporting feminism over designer microphones.
1.12.11. Pro: Fashion is already adapting to the evolving idea of "woman" carried by feminism.
