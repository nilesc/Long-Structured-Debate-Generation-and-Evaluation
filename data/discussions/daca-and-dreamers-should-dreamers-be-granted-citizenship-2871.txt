Discussion Title: DACA and DREAMers: Should DREAMers be Granted Citizenship?

1. Immigrants brought to the US illegally as children \(DREAMers\) should be granted US citizenship.
1.1. Pro: It is immoral to punish individuals for the actions of others. DREAMers did not chose to migrate to the United States.
1.1.1. Pro: DREAMers were brought to the US as minors, often by parents or other family members who were migrating; thus they shouldn't be punished for something that wasn't their choice.
1.1.1.1. Pro: DREAMers often don't even know there's anything different about them until they're in their mid- to late teens when immigration status starts to impact daily life in concrete ways. US public schools are obligated to accept students no matter their immigration status, so lack of citizenship, green card, or visa usually doesn't matter to younger children.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: A 2011 survey of young unauthorized immigrants found that only 19 percent of them found out about their immigration status when they were kids, 30 percent found out during the college application process, and 34 percent found out at work \([pg.9](http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/images/journals/docs/pdf/asr/Aug11ASRFeature.pdf)\).
1.1.1.2. Con: Not giving them citizenship is not punishment. It is withholding of an unjust reward.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Rewarding children who have spent their lives working and living in a country with citizenship is not unjust.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: It is unjust compared to a child who never got into our country because her family's legal application was not accepted.
1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: This is an apples to oranges comparison. One need not oppose one to support the other.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: Citizenship is neither a reward nor a punishment. It is merely a legal status.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Some legal statuses are preferably to others. In this case, US citizenship has many economic and political advantages for the individual. Thus, the individual is being given a better situation than he/she otherwise would have.
1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: Being legally accepted into a society you've been trying to be part of from years is a reward in the eyes of those who gain it.
1.1.1.2.2.3. Con: No one would want citizenship if it was not a privilege.
1.1.1.2.2.3.1. Con: People can and do want things that are not privileges.
1.1.1.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: Owning a car can be both a benefit or a burden. It isn't in itself either good or bad yet people still want cars.
1.1.1.2.2.3.1.2. Pro: Most people want to breathe, nobody is going to say breathing is a privilege.
1.1.1.2.2.3.2. Pro: If being a citizen is nothing special why clamor so hard to get it?
1.1.1.2.2.4. Pro: The request for citizenship is less about anything intrinsically special about the US over other countries and more a situational response to their experience being brought here and having grown up here, i.e. If their parents had snuck them into Canada they would be asking for Canadian citizenship because that is the place they would call home.
1.1.1.2.2.4.1. Con: Why do you make an example of Canada, what's wrong with Mexico?
1.1.1.2.2.5. Con: Citizenship of Congo may be just a legal status, but citizenship of United States is a privilege.
1.1.1.3. Con: There exists [legal precedent](https://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/parental-responsibility-in-all-50-states.pdf) that parents are responsible for the actions of their children until the age of 18, so legally it makes no difference whether or not migrating to the US was the child's choice.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: That citation refers to occasions where parents are responsible for their childrens' actions. The debate around DACA is about whether children should be held responsible for their parents actions.
1.1.1.4. Pro: As children under age 18 when they arrived in the US, DREAMers are not legally responsible for the illegal acts of the parents. DREAMers are victims, not perpetuators.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: If they are children now, they should be deported with their parents.  If they were brought here as children but are now adults, they are responsible for remaining here in violation of U.S. immigration law and should be deported.
1.1.1.4.2. Pro: Children are not held legally responsible until the age of 18 for the most part.  Simple as that, the children did not and can not break the law; therefore, they should have a clear path to citizenship with clear expectations.
1.1.1.4.3. Con: The children are not legally responsible, but that doesn't mean that they should enjoy benefits from their parents illegal action.
1.1.1.4.3.1. Con: Punishing children for the actions of their parents is wildly unethical.
1.1.1.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.
1.1.1.4.3.3. Pro: Stealing is illegal regardless of the goals or intention.
1.1.1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Access to a valuable education is a benefit of living or having a legal visa to study in a country that has a good educational system.   It is not a resource that can be easily offered without costs.
1.1.1.5. Con: Children often suffer as a result of decisions made by their parents - i.e schooling, diet, lifestyle etc. It is therefore not unfair that DREAMers should suffer the consequences of the illegal act committed by their parents.
1.1.2. Con: When an illegal action or activity is corrected, some people may be unfairly "punished." For example when Enron was forced to close, its employees lost their jobs. Nonetheless, illegality must be corrected.
1.1.3. Con: If parents snuck their children into Disney World and were caught and ejected from the park would you blame and punish Disney World?  The children here illegally should go back to their parents' country of origin with their parents. The majority of them are not minors now, and have not applied for citizenship since they've been here.
1.1.3.1. Con: DREAMers do not have the opportunity to apply for citizenship as they do not have green cards. In order to apply for one they would have to leave America and many of them having been raised in America do not have anywhere else to go.
1.1.3.2. Con: However if the children grew up living in Disney World, which is a closer comparison to the DREAMers situation, they would have [squatters rights](http://mentalfloss.com/article/54703/how-do-squatters-rights-work) on the area in which they resided.
1.1.3.3. Con: The Disney analogy oversimplifies the experience of DREAMers. Their lives are more like being snuck into Disney, growing up learning its language and culture, getting a job there, and contributing to its growth. The children should not be punished for the actions of their parents if Disney is all they know and they are contributing positively to it.
1.1.3.4. Con: The imagery of punishing Disney doesn't translate to what would happen to the US if DACA recipients were given a path to citizenship. This would not be a punishment to the US. While there would be costs involved it would also add people, many college educated, to the workforce, which means economic growth
1.1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.
1.1.4. Pro: Each candidate can be evaluated individually just as each application for legal permanent residency is considered individually, leaving aside the initial illegal entry which was not under the control of the person concerned.
1.1.5. Con: Children are often harmed by illegal actions of their parents by being forced into new homes or foster care. For example, parents who evade taxes to give a better life to their children go to jail.
1.1.6. Con: Regardless of choosing to migrate to the United States, when they became adults they violated the law by living in the US illegally, thus they would be deported for their own actions.
1.1.7. Con: Granting citizenship to dreamers would be tantamount to giving them a college degree because their parents falsified their school transcripts, or letting someone keep the money if their parents robbed a bank. It is not a punishment to not reward people for their parents behavior.
1.2. Pro: DREAMers are already highly integrated into US society and culture.
1.2.1. Pro: Deporting DREAMers from the country where they grew up will be unnecessarily hard on them.
1.2.1.1. Pro: If faced with deportation, DREAMers have no place to go to either because the United States is the only place many of them have ever called home.
1.2.1.2. Pro: One study found that [25%](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/31/16226934/daca-trump-dreamers-immigration) of DACA recipients have at least one US-born child of their own, who would undoubtedly be negatively affected as well if their parent was deported.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Deporting a parent with young children would just perpetuate the harmful cycle of childhood migration.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Since DREAMers have spent their formative years in the US, they are highly integrated within US society and would have a difficult time if sent elsewhere.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Citizenship is a complex matter that involve knowledge and approval of values and cultures with social links to the citizens of the country. Having grown with US values and culture, with US friends, law-abiding DREAMers are qualified to be citizens, and should be.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: People move abroad all the time and are able to adapt just fine. It usually just requires a short adjustment period.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: When people move abroad it is usually voluntary, and to a destination of their choice. This is not comparable to deportation.
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: Since most DREAMers are now in their [20s and beyond](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/31/16226934/daca-trump-dreamers-immigration)--many of which have families--it would be harder for them to start a new life now in another country.
1.2.1.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.2.1.3.4. Con: DREAMers were strangers when they first came to the US and learned how to live here, thus there's no reason why it shouldn't work the other way around.
1.2.1.3.4.1. Con: Assimilating to a place as a child, as DREAMers did in the US, is much easier than assimilating as an adult. Education systems are in place for children, and linguists show that learning a language as a child is much easier than as an adult.
1.2.1.3.4.2. Con: The US is a developed country with resources to assist people that are not available in other countries. People who are deported are likely to end up in countries without such assistance.
1.2.1.3.5. Con: DACA beneficiaries were eligible for the program as long as they entered the U.S. before their [16th](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/not-so-beautiful-dreamers-the-reality-behind-the-media-airbrushing) birthday. Therefore many of them may have arrived in their teenage years and so would have no problem readjusting to their native countries' customs.
1.2.1.4. Pro: Many DREAMers do not even speak the language of their native country.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: This depends on the age at which they came to the US, many of them are more proficient in their native language than English. The Center for Immigration Studies [estimates](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/not-so-beautiful-dreamers-the-reality-behind-the-media-airbrushing) that “perhaps 24 percent of the DACA-eligible population fall into the functionally illiterate category and another 46 percent have only ‘basic’ English ability.”
1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Those that are bilingual could provide a valuable skill to the workforce, considering that the US has notoriously [lacking](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/filling-americas-language-education-potholes/392876/) foreign language education and thus language skills are in high demand.
1.2.1.5. Pro: DREAMers have lived here for a significant portion of their lives, so they don't share the culture of their 'native country'. They would be lost foreigners there.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: If someone lived in a neighborhood for over a decade, and someone in that neighborhood decided to kidnap them, and drop them off at some strangers house, the kidnappers would generally be regarded as bad guys. There is no substantive difference between this scenario, and deporting DREAMers.
1.2.1.5.2. Pro: Many DREAMers face exclusion from culture or condescension by people from their native country once they move back.
1.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: "[Pocho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocho)/Pocha" is a [negative](http://citedatthecrossroads.net/chst116/2015/04/12/what-does-pocho-really-mean/) term used to shame Mexican Americans for not being [Mexican enough](http://www.biculturalfamilia.com/what-is-a-pocha-pocho/) and having lost their culture.
1.2.1.6. Con: US law should not be based on whether enforcement of existing law would be "unneccessarily hard" on non-citizens.
1.2.1.7. Pro: Many DACA recipients, if deported, would be sent into dangerous conditions made even more dangerous due to their lack of knowledge about the area and dangers present.
1.2.1.7.1. Pro: Many of the immigrants who cross into the US illegally have done so to [flee violence and civil war](https://www.wola.org/analysis/people-leaving-central-americas-northern-triangle/) in their home countries. Sending them back into these environments would be dangerous and immoral.
1.2.1.7.1.1. Con: Not granting citizenship to others, who are currently in worse situations would be immoral as well. So if someone is currently in a war zone, by this argument that person deserves US citizenship more than an illegal immigrant that has already been living in the US and used any of the benefits that it offers.
1.2.1.7.1.1.1. Con: False choice. Both may be granted citizenship.
1.2.1.7.1.2. Con: It is not the responsibility of the U.S. to accept illegal immigrants, even those fleeing violence and civil war.
1.2.1.7.1.3. Con: There is already a [system in place](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/refugees) for people that enter the country who are fleeing from dangerous or persecuted environments, viz. refugees and granting them asylum.
1.2.1.7.1.3.1. Pro: The U nonimmigrant status \(also known as the [U visa](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/other-ways-get-green-card/green-card-victim-crime-u-nonimmigrant)\) is an option available to victims of crimes who have suffered substantial mental or physical abuse as a result of the crime and who are willing to assist law enforcement and government officials in the investigation or prosecution of the criminal activity.
1.2.1.7.2. Con: This sets the precedent that the US should accept the entire population of dangerous countries as immigrants, which could be hundreds of millions of people.
1.2.2. Pro: DACA has promoted social integration by reducing participants’ fears surrounding their unauthorized status and instilling in them a greater sense of belonging and promoting increased civic participation \([pg.3](http://www.aacrao.org/docs/default-source/TrendTopic/Immigration/download.pdf?sfvrsn=0)\).
1.2.3. Pro: DREAMers have already assimilated into American culture, so they should be first in line for citizenship.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Their economic contribution is valuable and the cost of assimilation is already paid, and thus lower to the country than it would be for unassimilated foreigners taking their place in line.
1.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Citizenship is a status that is earned in living by the given values and culture of a certain country. Given that those individuals were raised in the US they in most cases meet those requirements.
1.2.3.4. Pro: There is no merit in having been born in the USA. The moral reason why natural born citizens have a right to live in the US and foreigners don't is not because they are heirs to a natural privilege, but because it's their home. So when DREAMers happen to grow up in the US \(without any unlawful intention, since they are children\), it is their home and they have the same right.
1.2.4. Pro: DREAMers are part of the labor force and work alongside citizens in important jobs.
1.2.4.1. Pro: DACA workers pay income tax. In fact, they tend to earn a higher level of income which means that they pay [more taxes](https://www.cato.org/blog/economic-fiscal-impact-repealing-daca), both through payroll, income, and sales as a result of greater consumption associated with higher income.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: The link argues that DACA recipients are as productive and qualified as H1-B visa holders. This should be seen as an argument for expanding the H1-B visa program, which DACA recipients would be free to apply for.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: The 1.3 million young undocumented immigrants enrolled or immediately eligible for DACA contribute an estimated [$2 billion](https://itep.org/state-local-tax-contributions-of-young-undocumented-immigrants/) a year in state and local taxes.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Roughly one-fifth of DREAMers work in the [health care and educational sector](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/business/economy/daca-dreamers-home-health-care.html?referer=), this could mean that their deportation would take workers away from in-demand job categories like home health aide and nursing assistant.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: Considering health a more valuable sector than agriculture, energy, or information is not only facile but also uneconomic.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: This is not a matter of value, but a matter of need; and the healthcare industry is [woefully understaffed](https://news.aamc.org/medical-education/article/new-aamc-research-reaffirms-looming-physician-shor/) with the doctor shortage projected to only grow worse as the US population increases.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: This would open work up for legal immigrants or Americans.
1.2.4.2.2.1. Con: They don't have a problem getting a job, and often have to have one to immigrate. It's not going to help more people immigrate either, there is already more demand for workers then there are slots.
1.2.4.2.3. Pro: Removing tens of thousands of workers from occupations that already suffer from a serious labor shortage will drive up costs.
1.2.4.2.4. Pro: Deportation of DREAMers would exacerbate the [U.S. doctor shortage](https://news.aamc.org/press-releases/article/workforce_projections_03142017/) and hurt patient care for thousands of Americans since currently there are [hundreds](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2017/09/05/how-trumps-move-to-end-daca-worsens-the-doctor-shortage/#405924195b06) of nurses, health-care workers, medical students and doctors-in-training with DACA status.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Many DREAMers are [serving](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/let-dreamers-live-the-american-dream/2017/09/04/0b1dbb02-9177-11e7-89fa-bb822a46da5b_story.html?utm_term=.a7b566356c0a) in the US military. According to some [estimates](https://vittana.org/15-pros-and-cons-of-the-dream-act), up to 1,000 individuals may be covered by the Act.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: An exception can be made to allow those DREAMers that have served in the military to remain, so long as they go through the legal citizenship process.
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: It would be an incredible insult to tell these DREAMers that they are no longer allowed to live in the country for which they've put their lives on the line.
1.2.4.3.2.1. Con: This argument only proves that illegal immigrants serving in the US military should not be deported. It does not prove why DREAMers in general should not be deported.
1.2.4.3.2.2. Con: [Special provisions](https://www.uscis.gov/news/fact-sheets/naturalization-through-military-service-fact-sheet) already exists to assist and expedite the naturalization of members of the armed forces.
1.2.5. Con: The legal immigration system is designed to enhance and ensure assimilation, skirting that system creates less assimilation.
1.2.6. Con: Illegal immigrants are by definition not obeying legal cultural norms, which is a foundational pillar of civilized society, i.e. law.  Due to the legal challenges, their support system tends to be comprised of people who come from similar backgrounds or from others willing to break the law. This also prevents or delays assimilation into the new culture.
1.2.6.1. Con: Willingness to not obey legal cultural norms is the opposite foundational pillar of a civilized society, i.e Civil Disobedience. Without it, a culture can stagnate & choke from within on its own.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Delayed assimilation into the new culture tends to come from protectionism, which has rarely served any civilization over the long term. As the outside world progresses into the future without that protected culture/civilization, it leaves that protected culture/civilization vulnerable in many ways.
1.2.7. Con: Speaking English is a big part of assimilation into any culture.  "[DACA](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/not-so-beautiful-dreamers-the-reality-behind-the-media-airbrushing) had no requirement of English fluency...perhaps 24 percent of the DACA-eligible population fall into the functionally illiterate category and another 46 percent have only ‘basic’ English ability".
1.2.7.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.
1.2.7.2. Con: One who knows [Spanish](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-the-spanish-language-isnt-foreign-in-the-united-states_us_5746fac3e4b055bb11714a36) is also cultural integrated into the United States.
1.2.7.3. Pro: The [majority](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/02/01/512708133/to-be-american-first-speak-english-study-says) of people associate speaking English with being American and identify it as one of the most important traits for an American to have.
1.2.7.3.1. Con: [90%](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/6/15924444/global-warming-consensus-survey) of Americans also don't believe there are consequences of global warming. Surveys reflect people's beliefs, not the truth.
1.2.7.3.1.1. Con: Irrelevant. Citizenship is a social/legal construct to begin with, unlike global warming. In a democracy, the beliefs of the majority carry real legal weight.
1.2.8. Pro: Workers in the DACA program tend to be [younger, better educated, and more highly paid](https://www.cato.org/blog/economic-fiscal-impact-repealing-daca) than the typical immigrant
1.2.8.1. Con: US law and federal immigration policy should not be based on age, economic status, salary, or degrees received.
1.2.8.2. Pro: The population eligible for DACA is much more likely to be working white-collar jobs than other unauthorized immigrants \([pg.7](http://www.aacrao.org/docs/default-source/TrendTopic/Immigration/download.pdf?sfvrsn=0)\).
1.2.8.2.1. Con: There is nothing inherently good or right or more economically intrinsically productive about a "white collar job" as opposed to a "blue" or "no" collar job
1.2.8.3. Pro: [Almost half](http://www.acenet.edu/Pages/Protect-Dreamers-Higher-Education-Coalition.aspx#tabContent-3) of DACA recipients are in school or pursuing a college degree.
1.2.8.3.1. Con: According to 2014 estimates from the Migration Policy Institute, nearly 400,000 young immigrants who would otherwise qualify for DACA don’t meet the educational requirements for it since they dropped out of high school and don’t have a GED. Even immigrants who are DACA-eligible often don’t go beyond high school; only 57,000 of them, or about 5 percent, have bachelor’s degrees, with another 20 percent currently enrolled in college \([pg.4](http://www.aacrao.org/docs/default-source/TrendTopic/Immigration/download.pdf?sfvrsn=0)\).
1.2.8.3.2. Con: Nolan G. Pope published a [study](https://www.cato.org/blog/economic-fiscal-impact-repealing-daca) in the Journal of Public Economics in 2016 that showed no correlation between being a DREAMer and pursuing higher education, although it is possible that simply not enough time has passed to observe an effect.
1.2.8.3.2.1. Con: In order to [qualify](https://www.uscis.gov/archive/frequently-asked-questions) for DACA, applicants must either be currently enrolled in school or already possess a high school diploma or GED certificate. Therefore, those protected by DACA are in a far better educational position than the majority of illegal immigrants.
1.2.8.4. Pro: A [2017 survey](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/31/16226934/daca-trump-dreamers-immigration) found that annual earnings increased 80% for those who received DACA protection, while 5% of recipients even went on to start their own businesses.
1.2.8.5. Pro: Learning that they're illegal and liable for deportation forces many immigrants to narrow their ambitions, since they know that legal status will affect their opportunities in life. Granting DREAMers citizenship would thus allow them to live up their full potential.
1.2.8.5.1. Pro: Once teenagers find out the truth about being illegal, they have to adjust their expectations of what they can achieve in life to match their new reality. Many respond by losing motivation to succeed in school or pursue high-status careers, because they can’t imagine how it would be possible for an illegal immigrant to succeed. \([Gonzales, pg.7\)](http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/images/journals/docs/pdf/asr/Aug11ASRFeature.pdf)
1.2.8.5.2. Con: The fact that there is a benefit to a party is not adequate reason to justify the enactment of a policy.
1.2.8.5.2.1. Con: The fact that there is a benefit to a party is the only adequate reason to justify the enactment of a policy. A country should not enact policies that harm or fail to help.
1.2.8.5.2.2. Pro: While a policy may benefit a party, it may do harm on another level. Granting citizenship to DREAMers benefits them, but creates an incentive for more illegal immigration, among other harms \(see all the "Cons" for other harms.\)
1.2.8.6. Con: Those who are educated and productive will likely be eligible for [merit based immigration](https://www.hooyou.com/reform/merit-base-visa.html) in the legal system.
1.2.8.6.1. Con: [Anyone undocumented within the country for a period greater then one year, which the DREAMers have, is barred from entering the country legally for 10 years](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/three-and-ten-year-bars), as such the parent statement is false.
1.2.9. Pro: [73 percent](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/31/16226934/daca-trump-dreamers-immigration) of DREAMers have at least one US citizen as a member of their immediate family \(child, spouse or sibling\).
1.2.9.1. Con: There are current legal ways to sponsor a [spouse](https://www.uscis.gov/family/family-us-citizens/spouse/bringing-spouses-live-united-states-permanent-residents) or [family member](https://www.uscis.gov/family/family-us-citizens/children/bringing-children-sons-and-daughters-live-united-states-permanent-residents) for immigration.
1.2.9.1.1. Con: Many of these relations are their children and U.S. citizens [cannot](https://www.us-immigration.com/blog/can-minor-u-s-citizen-children-sponsor-their-parents/) file immigrant petitions for their undocumented parents until they turn 21.
1.3. Pro: DREAMers provide an economic benefit to society.
1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.
1.3.2. Pro: By [working and spending](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2016/10/18/146290/new-study-of-daca-beneficiaries-shows-positive-economic-and-educational-outcomes/) DREAMers have a positive impact on US GDP.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Granting citizenship to DREAMers will lead to substantial wage gains for them. In turn, these wage gains will help spur the American economy and lead to [significant increases](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2010/01/07/7187/raising-the-floor-for-american-workers/) in gross domestic product, tax revenue, and jobs in the coming years.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: The American Progress report discusses GDP, not GDP per capita.  This is an important distinction.  Doubling the population and doubling the GDP does not improve the standard of living, it just adjusts an accounting border.
1.3.2.2. Con: The hard data in the American Progress report referenced discusses the benefit of legal status for "DREAMers" themselves, e.g. "...DACA increased recipients’ average hourly wages by 42 percent."  That does not show they are good for the economy overall \(nor disprove it\).  The report speculates on net economic benefit, but does not actually demonstrate it.
1.3.3. Con: [50%](https://itep.org/wp-content/uploads/undocumentedtaxes.pdf) of illegal immigrants do not pay income tax.
1.3.3.1. Con: All illegal immigrants must still pay sales taxes.
1.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.3.4. Pro: Deporting educated, skilled DREAMers would create a "[brain drain](https://www.wired.com/2016/11/trumps-immigration-crackdown-spark-tech-brain-drain/)" effect on the economy, and result in a negative ROI on public education funds spent.
1.3.5. Pro: DREAMers bring diversity to our workforce, allowing for greater adaptability in fluctuating markets of our global economy.
1.3.6. Con: Sending U.S. educated and trained DREAMers back to their home countries would improve social equity in other countries while supporting a healthier and more secure U.S. economy.
1.3.6.1. Con: Deporting DREAMers to a place that is a foreign country for them is likely to subject them to unemployment, homelessness, cultural and language barriers, discrimination in those countries and psychological distress from a forced deportation. Social equity will therefore not improve.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.
1.3.7. Pro: DREAMers boost the economy through payment of taxes.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Illegal immigrants contribute to the funding of government services through taxes, despite being [unable to access those services.](https://newrepublic.com/article/122714/immigrants-dont-drain-welfare-they-fund-it)
1.3.7.2. Pro: If DREAMers are deported, it’s [estimated](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a15888182/daca-dreamers-economic-political-benefits/) that the U.S. would lose $60 billion in federal taxes and $460.3 billion in economic growth over 10 years.
1.3.7.3. Pro: If the House and Senate decide to replace DACA with a path to citizenship, it is estimated that DACA recipients could contribute an additional nearly $[505](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a15888182/daca-dreamers-economic-political-benefits/) million in state and local taxes.
1.3.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.3.8. Con: US companies violate US law when hiring illegal immigrants such as the DREAMers not protected by DACA. Economic benefit does not justify breaking the law.
1.3.8.1. Con: The DREAMers contribution to the economy is such that losing them overnight would mean a pretty big dip in the stock market, goverment spending, and a lot more indicators, and pillars of the USA economy at once. This would on top of the previously mentioned damage cause a confidence crises and put the USA straight into a massive recession, possibly even depression. The logic that justifies bailing out criminally manipulative banks applies to the DREAMers as well.
1.3.8.1.1. Con: The logic used to justify bailing out criminally manipulative banks was fundamentally [flawed](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2013/09/26/study-shows-bank-bailouts-are-an-incentive-to-be-reckless).
1.3.8.1.1.1. Con: The logic was just fine. There might be consequences to following it, consequence that can be mitigated by making new laws, but the consequences exist outside the logical framework.
1.3.8.1.2. Con: The rule of law is more important than negative economic consequences.
1.3.8.1.2.1. Con: The rule of law is not universally upheld above economic benefits. The economic cost of not wasting one's time has often been held more important then the rule of law by law enforcement and prosecutors, which is why every year, thousands of littering cases go unprosecuted.
1.3.8.1.2.2. Pro: Preserving the rule of law will, in the long term, have more significant positive impacts because it ensures stability in society.
1.3.8.1.2.2.1. Con: Preserving the rule of law as an ends, and not a means, will rapidly create police states devoid of freedom.
1.3.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.
1.3.10. Con: If those "DREAMers" aren't working, or aren't documented as working \(1099, W-2\), they have more of a negative impact than positive, as they aren't earning at least minimum wage, which drives down wages nationally.  Also in many cases their wages end up going back to their home countries, which does nothing to help our economy.
1.3.10.1. Con: They are working.[So many of them are working, that them being forced out of our economy would significantly harm it.](http://dailycaller.com/2017/09/11/the-numbers-behind-the-dreamers/)
1.3.10.2. Con: Whatever "as they aren't earning at least minimum wage, which drives down wages nationally" is supposed to mean, the statement is false, there's no magical force that compels people to lower wages when other people aren't working.
1.3.10.3. Con: DREAMers' parents brought them there and are living with them, thus this is their home country.
1.3.10.4. Con: Money sent abroad can either reenter the country, or not. If it does reenter the country, that means we make and sell more. If it doesn't reenter the country, that means we get whatever we spent that money on for free.
1.3.10.5. Con: HavIng grown up in the US. DREAMers are rooted there. They are sending remittances at a much lower volume than older generations of immigrants. Most DACA recipients don't have a partner/kids in their home country to send money to. They build their life in the US. Their family, friends and partners are here, their money largely stays here.
1.3.10.6. Pro: In 2016, nearly [$140 billion](http://www.pewglobal.org/interactives/remittance-map/) in remittances were sent from the US to other countries.
1.3.11. Con: Giving DREAMers citizenship would decrease job opportunities for those who have always been US citizens by increasing competition for available positions.
1.3.11.1. Con: The number of jobs in the United States is not fixed. An influx of immigrant workers generates economic growth and employment opportunities by increasing production.
1.3.11.2. Pro: Increased job competition allows employers to hire at lower wages, which means that applicants will struggle harder to make ends meet.
1.3.11.2.1. Con: [Research](https://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/economy/news/2013/03/20/57354/legal-status-for-undocumented-workers-is-good-for-american-workers/) on the effect of increases in immigration over the past few decades shows little to no wage or employment effects, and alleviates concerns about possible harm from future immigration.
1.3.11.3. Con: An [American Action Forum](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/labor-output-declines-removing-undocumented-immigrants/) study found that if all undocumented immigrants were deported, there would not be enough American workers to fill all of the jobs that would be left open.
1.3.11.4. Con: A [Moody's Analytics](https://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/2016-06-17-Trumps-Economic-Policies.pdf) analysis of Trump's proposed economic policies last year demonstrated that  if the US were to remove all undocumented immigrants from the labor force it would would trigger an economic recession within one year.
1.4. Con: There are other alternatives to granting them citizenship.
1.4.1. Pro: Another legal immigration status, like permanent legal alien status, would serve DREAMers equally.
1.4.1.1. Pro: If the undocumented were granted legal status [without a special pathway to citizenship](http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/immigration-alternatives-weigh-paths-citizenship-least-legalization/1qZkBZjBlxjXmZrXVUXbAI/) written into the bill, then they would no longer would have to fear deportation, could work legally and could eventually apply for citizenship through existing channels.
1.4.1.2. Con: Permanent legal alien status [does not confer the same rights and privileges](http://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/us-immigration/permanent-resident-vs-citizen-difference.html) that full citizenship does, so it's difficult to see how permanent legal alien status would serve DREAMers as well as full citizenship.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Permanent residents do not have the [right to vote](http://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/us-immigration/permanent-resident-vs-citizen-difference.html) in any US election, since they are not US citizens.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Permanent residents [do not possess US passports](http://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/us-immigration/permanent-resident-vs-citizen-difference.html), so it is difficult to travel as freely.
1.4.1.2.3. Con: Permanent residents become citizens through [the same path to citizenship](http://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/us-immigration/permanent-resident-vs-citizen-difference.html) as all others who are naturalized citizens. If DREAMers followed these processes, everyone would perceive their citizenship as equally legitimate to other immigrants.
1.4.2. Pro: As with many legal immigrants, a visa \(work, study, etc.\) can be issued and used for the procurement of status as a permanent resident \(PR\).  If time is a factor to achieve permanent residency status, the visa may be extended for that duration.  Once PR has been acquired, the standard path to citizenship can be followed; which is what every other legal immigrant had to follow.
1.4.2.1. Con: DREAMers should not be channeled into processes designed for immigrants because DREAMers are not like most immigrants. DREAMers did not choose to leave some other country, and they did not choose to go to the US. Processes designed for foreign immigrants should be used for foreign immigrants, and a process appropriate for the situation DREAMers face should be used for DREAMers.
1.4.2.2. Con: Granting green card status is functionally the way that DREAMers would be granted citizenship. To say that they be granted permanent residency is not really different than saying that they should be granted citizenship.
1.4.3. Con: Even with help from a lawyer, it can take up to 10 years to receive US citizenship for a DREAMer. Without another action, in the interim they would be sent back to a country that many have no memory of and no ties to.
1.4.4. Con: Anything less than real citizenship will further marginalize DREAMers and reduce their rights.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Just as DREAMers became vulnerable when the Trump Administration did not renew DACA, any bandaid solution will require that their legal status will have to be revisited in the future, meaning that DREAMers will not be able to live securely and in confidence of their place in the country.
1.4.4.2. Con: Rights are only granted to citizens, these "DREAMers" have no rights to marginalize as they are here illegally.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: "We hold these truth to be self evident that all men are created equal" were the very first words of the new nation of America, words which were cemented into the highest of laws of the USA in 1868 with the 14th amendment and reaffirmed in 1964 with the Civil rights act.
1.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: Border security does not treat people equally, and therefore goes against this very core idea of the USA.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1. Con: It is not un-American for the government to discriminate in all circumstances. Just as we would expect the government to fill a job vacancy with the most qualified candidate, so too, we would expect them to pick immigrants who would be most beneficial to the country.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Currently, we are not filling the job vacancy we have with the most qualified candidates, we are using nepotism to fill almost all the job vacancies of our country, which is not fair to the qualified immigrants applying for the job.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1.2. Con: If someone said "we don't discriminant against black people, we carefully screen our black potential employees to only select the best", while simultaneously letting 3 white guys who never even filled out an application clock in, and start working, there would be no doubt there is racism going on. Yet for some reason, that exact argument is used to dismiss our treatment of immigrants to show how it is not xenophobia.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1.3. Con: Discrimination on grounds such as skill, or ability is not wrong, it is necessary, but discrimination against immigrants has no such bases.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1.4. Con: It is morally reprehensible to prioritize the immigration of those considered the "most beneficial" to the US over those who are trying to escape from the dire or life-threatening conditions.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.7.1.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1.4.2. Con: The government of the US has a fiduciary duty to its citizens to pursue the immigration policy that is most beneficial to the nation.
1.4.4.2.1.2. Con: The Declaration of Independence merely claims "all men are created equal" and therefore all people have a right to just and equitable treatment under the law. It does not mean everyone is to be treated identically, nor does it entitle non-citizens to citizenship.
1.4.4.2.1.2.1. Con: Unless there is some actual reason for such qualification, it can only be concluded that some people are more 'equal' then others.
1.4.4.2.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.2.1.1.1.
1.4.4.2.2. Con: Legality does not effect the existence of rights one way or the other. All rights are unalienable.
1.5. Con: Giving the benefits of citizenship to DREAMers would be costly, taking away resources from those who are legally in the US.
1.5.1. Con: Rapidly [aging societies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12316297) struggle economically.  Encouraging young DREAMers to stay ensures a healthy workforce to support economic growth and taxes for many years to come.
1.5.2. Pro: Illegal immigrants compete primarily for jobs and housing which would otherwise be given to those of lower socioeconomic status, so the brunt of the problems are taken on by those communities.
1.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.8.2.
1.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.11.1.
1.5.2.3. Con: The US population is lacking a young population to replace and support the aging population. We need more young workers and taxpayers to contribute to Social Security and all public works.
1.5.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.11.2.
1.5.2.5. Con: -> See 1.3.11.3.
1.5.3. Pro: We have no moral responsibility to accept illegal immigrants and their children into our country. We have a moral responsibility to put natural Americans first and foremost.
1.5.3.1. Con: The DREAMers are nearly indistinguishable from natural Americans. They grew up in the US, and were immersed in it from a young age.
1.5.3.2. Con: We have no more responsibility to native born Americans then any other type of American.
1.5.3.3. Con: We have no more responsibility to an American then we do to anyone else in the world.
1.5.3.4. Con: Throwing people out of their homes is not 'not taking responsibility for them' it is a clear, and deliberate act to harm them. Someone who holds a door closed as someone burns to death on the other side, banging to get out, can not claim lack of responsibility as a defense, they are committing murder.
1.5.3.4.1. Con: It's not "throwing someone out of their home" to evict a squatter.
1.5.3.4.1.1. Con: [Over the time period we are discusing, people cease being squatters.](https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/squatters-rights/)
1.5.4. Con: Law enforcement would be free to focus on other, more significant crimes, rather than spending their resources pursuing deportation for DREAMers.
1.5.4.1. Pro: The enforcement cost of deporting DACA workers would cost around $10,000 per removal, according to the [Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2015/02/23/106983/what-would-it-cost-to-deport-all-5-million-beneficiaries-of-executive-action-on-immigration/). The total deportation cost, aside from economic losses would be $50 billion.
1.5.5. Con: In order to participate in the program, DREAMers are required to be productive members of society who are adding a positive balance to society by being employed and contributing to, rather than draining from, the common benefits.
1.5.6. Pro: Benefit requirements for healthcare, education, welfare, and other services would all increase, ultimately [putting a strain](https://vittana.org/15-pros-and-cons-of-the-dream-act) on what is available to those in need.
1.5.6.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.
1.5.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.11.
1.5.8. Con: The cost would be more than offset by the taxes that DREAMers would now be able to pay.
1.5.8.1. Pro: Dreamers are already paying state and local taxes. So they would just be reaping a greater benefit from what they are contributing to the US.[cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/06/us/daca-myths-debunked/index.html)
1.5.9. Pro: There are more than [five billion people in the world](http://craignelsen.com/img/graphics/world_population_children.jpg) living in countries poorer than Mexico. Many would risk much for a chance to increase their consumption levels in the US while forcing US taxpayers to educate their children and provide them health care. Recognizing limits is a sign of maturity. We need to act like adults and say "no".
1.6. Pro: Deportation is detrimental to DREAMers' well-being.
1.6.1. Pro: Leaving DREAMers in a state of deportation limbo is harmful to them.
1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.5.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Studies have shown that living in fear of deportation can lead to [devastating physical and psychological health problems.](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/03/deportation-stress/520008/).
1.6.1.2.1. Pro: The constant fear of deportation can even lead some people to commit suicide, as was the case with [Joaquin Luna](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/29/joaquin-luna-immigration-texas-suicide) in 2011 after the DREAM act failed to pass in the US Senate.
1.6.1.3. Con: Deporting them solves the 'deportation limbo' problem as completely as granting them citizenship does.
1.6.1.3.1. Pro: It also has the benefit of being in accordance with U.S. immigration law.
1.6.1.3.2. Con: In many cases, deporting immigrants is even more harmful than keeping them under constant threat of deportation.
1.6.1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.7.1.
1.6.1.4. Pro: DREAMers who do not have citizenship status are often afraid to report crimes committed against them, since talking to the police could result in them being deported. This makes them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.
1.6.1.5. Pro: Many DREAMers would [lose their scholarships](https://www.ft.com/content/90f6060a-ebcf-11e7-8713-513b1d7ca85a), internships or work placements in the interim, forcing them to go back into the shadows and work under the table.
1.6.1.5.1. Con: Any scholarship, internship or job given to a non-citizen means it was taken from a citizen. If you are smart enough to obtain these then you should understand the risks.
1.6.1.5.1.1. Con: This is incorrect, as there are numerous [scholarships](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/scholarships-for-undocumented-students/) designated specifically for non-citizens and even for undocumented immigrants that US citizens would not be eligible for.
1.6.1.5.1.1.1. Con: Any scholarship that is open to citizens and non-citizens is taken from a citizen if it is awarded to a non-citizen. Any scholarship designated specifically for non-citizens is taken from a citizen, by design.
1.6.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: This is not necessarily true, as one cannot assume that those who have created scholarship funds for non-citizens would be willing to put that money towards funding the education of citizens had they felt that non-citizens didn't need the aid.
1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.7.1.
1.6.3. Con: Citizenship is not necessary to prevent [deportation](http://www.landerholmimmigration.com/8-ways-defend-deportation/).
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.6.5. Pro: It is quite possible their country of origin will not recognize them as citizens.
1.6.5.1. Con: They are citizens of another country.  It's unheard of for a government to refuse reentry of it's own citizenry after time abroad. Rather they were here visiting, studying or on vacation the time has come for them to return home, rather they want to or not.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: [Myanmar does not recognize the Rohingya.​](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/08/rohingya-muslims-170831065142812.html)
1.6.5.1.2. Con: These people at no point in their life acted like citizens of their country of birth, the government has done nothing for them, and there is no reason for the government to take them since it has its own problems to deal with.
1.6.5.1.3. Con: These people have lived here all their lives, yet according to this argument, they should not be treated as citizens. It is transparently obvious how a similar argument could be used by the country where they merely happened to be popped out to deny them citizenship. To demand the other country take them when we will not is nothing short of hypocrisy.
1.6.5.1.4. Con: Calling people's entire life, their family, their education, everything they have a "vacation" is a special kind of disingenuous.
1.6.6. Pro: Many of the deportations threaten a range of fundamental human rights including the [right to family unity](https://www.hrw.org/report/2007/07/16/forced-apart/families-separated-and-immigrants-harmed-united-states-deportation#unity), the [right to seek asylum from persecution](https://www.hrw.org/report/2007/07/16/forced-apart/families-separated-and-immigrants-harmed-united-states-deportation#protection), the [right to due process](https://www.hrw.org/report/2007/07/16/forced-apart/families-separated-and-immigrants-harmed-united-states-deportation#defenses), and the [rights of children](https://www.hrw.org/report/2007/07/16/forced-apart/families-separated-and-immigrants-harmed-united-states-deportation#children).
1.6.6.1. Con: Family unity can still be achieved on the other side of border, or through a legal path. Seeking asylum is still available to those with a valid case. None of this is a valid reason for granting citizenship.
1.6.7. Con: There are billions of poor people across the globe who would benefit from U.S. legal residency.  That is not a sufficient reason to admit them, nor is it a sufficient reason to allow them to remain once they enter illegally. Their hardship must be weighed up against the consequences for America.
1.7. Con: Granting DREAMers citizenship would create a schism between the immigrant population.
1.7.1. Pro: Granting only DREAMers citizenship sets up a narrative of ["good versus bad immigrant"](https://www.aclu.org/blog/immigrants-rights/road-citizenship/dreamer-i-will-not-be-bargaining-chip-trumps-attack) by splitting the population into those who are deserving and undeserving.
1.7.1.1. Pro: This narrative propagates the idea that DREAMers are deserving because they had no say in their migration, while their parents are therefore undeserving when all they wanted was a better life for their families.
1.7.1.2. Con: Such a narrative of "good vs bad" immigrant already exists between legal and illegal immigrants.
1.7.1.3. Con: It is less a "good vs bad" as it is a "innocent vs guilty", as these immigrants did not make the decisions themselves to come to the US.
1.7.2. Pro: Granting DREAMers citizenship is unfair to those waiting to come here legally.
1.7.2.1. Con: This is a straw man fallacy. People participating in the existing citizenship process are unaffected by DREAMers. To wit, there is no quota or decision on legal immigration as a byproduct of illegal immigration.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: It is unfair that one set of people are waiting to come here legally, while others circumvent the legal process and still get the desired result.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Con: DREAMers are children who did not knowingly or willingly circumvent the legal process.
1.7.2.1.2. Con: The legal immigration system is designed to allow for orderly immigration process. Rewarding those who disregard the law by allowing them to bypass the process will result in requests to reduce the legal immigrant allotment.
1.7.2.2. Con: The current process of Immigration selects out most of the demographics that DREAMer families fall into within their home countries. They would never be allowed in legally, not for lack of humanity on our part, but for prioritization of skilled and / or financially capable immigrants, or those who have provided service for the US abroad.
1.7.2.3. Con: The current process which allows immigrants to migrate legally is costly and time consuming to underprivileged immigrants with no guarantee of success. Many of those who migrate illegally are doing it to avoid life threatening situations for thier children. It is inhumane to put those children in danger to save ourselves minimal amounts of money. Lives are much more valuable then money.
1.7.2.3.1. Con: If we undertook the task of helping out every underprivileged would-be illegal immigrant, our country would not survive.
1.7.2.4. Pro: For legal immigrants, it takes years of process, stringent requirements and specific circumstance, and no guaranty of success. Now DACA is requesting a citizenship just because their parents chose to break the law?
1.7.2.4.1. Pro: There are a total of 8 category of green card application. 1 through Family 2 through Employment 3 as a Special Immigrant 4 through Refugee or Asylee Status 5 for Human Trafficking and Crime Victims 6 for Victims of Abuse 7 through Other Categories 8 through Registry.
1.7.3. Con: Immigration policies by their nature include some and exclude others. Thus, if a “schism” were possible, we would already be seeing deleterious effects as a result of current policy, but we aren’t.
1.8. Pro: DREAMers actively contribute to society, culturally and politically.
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.3.
1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.3.
1.8.4. Pro: Helping people to continue being positive actors in our communities is an essential part to overall safety, well-being, and solidarity all throughout the United States. If a DREAMer is contributing positively, which means they're working, going to school, volunteering or just as long as they have no criminal record, then they should be able to be consided for citizenship.
1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.3.6.
1.8.6. Pro: Even beyond the DREAMers debate; the USA was built by and founded upon immigrants. The American "national identity" was idealized by the founding fathers, based on deistic and laisic-christian faith with the intention of giving opportunities to any person who was willing to share the same values.
1.8.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.5.
1.8.8. Con: Individuals who immigrate by more traditional and accepted methods such as by acquiring green cards or through naturalization also contribute to society equally, therefore, the contributions of a DREAMer should not be preferred over the contributions of other immigrants.
1.8.8.1. Con: The issue is not comparing if a DREAMer contributes more or less than other immigrants. The issues is whether or not the laws allow for DREAMers to be granted citizenship. The notion of what is 'traditional' or 'accepted' is too subjective to be considered as relevant.
1.8.8.2. Con: While this may be true, it has no impact on the question of whether or not DACA recipients would have a greater or lesser impact on the economy or society as a whole.
1.8.9. Con: Non-citizens are disproportionately likely to be charged of non-immigration crimes and incarcerated at significantly higher rates than native-born citizens. DREAMers are not citizens, so they fall within this category. [cis.org](https://cis.org/Camarota/NonCitizens-Committed-Disproportionate-Share-Federal-Crimes-201116)
1.8.9.1. Con: The cited article says nothing about DREAMers, but rather talks about non-citizens in general.
1.8.9.2. Con: People of color have higher incarceration rates often due to [racial discrimination](https://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/46946_CH_3.pdf), and economic injustice that prevents them from being able to afford adequate defense.
1.8.9.3. Con: [DREAMers are less likely to be incarcerated than nativeborn Americans with the same age and education. DACA-ineligible illegal immigrants and all other legal immigrants are even less likely to be incarcerated.](https://www.cato.org/publications/immigration-research-policy-brief/dreamer-incarceration-rate)
1.9. Pro: US policy had a significant impact in creating the conditions that led to the immigration of DREAMers and they ought to be compensated with citizenship.
1.9.1. Pro: In the case of Mexican immigration, US economic policies have displaced Mexican farmers.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Their livelihoods were [destroyed by NAFTA](http://www.politicalresearch.org), forcing them to lose their farms and emigrate to US fields.
1.9.1.1.1. Pro: NAFTA and Immigration policy are inextricably linked, however "Congress has debated immigration policy as though those trade agreements bore no relationship to the waves of displaced people migrating to the U.S., looking for work."   "NAFTA, however, did not lead to rising incomes and employment in Mexico, and did not decrease the flow of migrants. Instead, it became a source of pressure on Mexicans to migrate."[NAFTA Caused Migration From Mexixo](http://www.politicalresearch.org/2014/10/11/globalization-and-nafta-caused-migration-from-mexico/)
1.9.2. Pro: [CAFTA](https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/U-S-foreign-policy-provoked-immigration-crisis-5616041.php) restructured trade relations with Central America and gave unprecedented power to U.S. corporations. This caused the devastation of Central American economies, particularly agriculture and so has contributed to mass migration.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Under [CAFTA](http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2014/09/cafta-and-the-forced-migration-crisis.html), Agricultural imports from the United States in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala have risen 78 percent. This increase demonstrate the loss to farmers in these areas.
1.9.3. Con: Many DREAMers come from countries who don't have problems that can be blamed on the United States \(such as Ireland [npr.org](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/22/578930256/undocumented-irish-unexpectedly-caught-in-trumps-immigration-dragnet)\).
1.9.3.1. Con: [Current](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/25/key-facts-about-unauthorized-immigrants-enrolled-in-daca/ft_17-09-25_daca_topcountries/) DACA recipients come from around the world, but more than nine-in-ten were born in Latin America. Mexico is by far the top country of origin for active DACA recipients \(548,000\), followed by El Salvador \(25,900\), Guatemala \(17,700\) and Honduras \(16,100\). U.S. involvement in the past helped create the conditions in [Honduras](https://theconversation.com/how-us-policy-in-honduras-set-the-stage-for-todays-mass-migration-65935), [El Salvador](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-santiago/revisiting-american-invol_b_177841.html) and [Guatemala](https://thepanoptic.co.uk/2016/11/19/american-intervention-guatemala/) which set the stage for today’s mass migration.
1.9.4. Con: This could set a precedent that anyone living in a country that has ever been harmed by the United States in any way is owed citizenship, which could amount to hundreds of millions of people.
1.10. Con: This would involve rewarding an illegal action.
1.10.1. Pro: To grant DREAMers citizenship would be to reward, rather than punish, an illegal act, which is principally unjust.
1.10.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.10.1.2. Pro: Allowing people to circumvent citizenship laws is no different than allowing them to circumvent any other laws.  Selective application of the law has historically been used to oppress different groups in our country and sets a precedent that some people are above the rule of law.
1.10.1.2.1. Pro: If we selectively make new citizenship rules for DREAMers, we will find that we will have more and more DREAMers in the future.
1.10.1.3. Pro: If you're not willing uphold a law put in place for national security \(including enabling people to circumvent it\) then the law should not exist. Because migration control is necessary for common welfare, this law is necessary and needs to exist. Not enforcing it is a sign of weakness and a disservice to those trying to enter the country legally.
1.10.1.3.1. Pro: When a family immigrates illegally, the enforcement action should be deportation of the whole family. Anything less than that \(like allowing the children to stay, let alone granting them citizenship\) means that we are not upholding the law.
1.10.1.4. Con: To exist within a country you were brought to without your own deliberate choice should not be considered illegal.  Doing so creates a legal second class within the US, potentially violating the equal protections clause of the 14th amendment.
1.10.1.5. Pro: Considering the actions before DACA of those who where working in the U.S.; giving amnesty is in effect granting a free pass on actions that would result in jail for citizens. Working with false papers, identity theft, working for cash and not filing taxes are felonies and misdemeanors. That special treatment seems inappropriate.
1.10.1.6. Pro: DACA was 100% illegal/unconstitutional when Barack Obama created it.  A president [does not have Constitutional authority](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/daca-unconstitutional-obama-admitted) to create laws.  He is the head of the Executive branch of government where he is to "execute" laws that the Congress create lawfully.
1.10.1.6.1. Con: If this was true, then it would have been taken to court and struck down. The President was within his Constitutionally and Congressionally granted powers to implement DACA.
1.10.1.6.1.1. Con: The lack of a Constitutional challenge is not in and of itself evidence of the Constitutionality of state action.
1.10.1.6.2. Con: The President, as head of the Executive, has discretion over the actions of officers of the executive. He is well within his rights to order executive officers not to prosecute people for a crime.
1.10.1.6.2.1. Pro: A law provides the executive with the ability, but not an obligation to prosecute people for an act. The executive order signed by Obama made use of this discretion to not prosecute DREAMers.
1.10.1.6.3. Pro: President Obama illegally created a "law" by creating DACA, because the Constitution gives all lawmaking power to Congress.  [Article 1 Section 1](https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/article-1-legislative-branch/section-1-all-law-making-power-in-congress) of the US. Constitution states "All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives."
1.10.1.6.3.1. Con: DACA is a [policy](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/sep/05/fact-checking-attorney-general-jeff-sessions-remar/), but it is not a law.
1.10.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: "In announcing DACA, Obama emphasized that it was a [temporary policy](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/09/donald-trump/obama-hedged-didnt-say-he-lacked-legal-right-daca/). He did not issue an executive order. Rather, the policy was released by the Department of Homeland Security."
1.10.1.6.4. Con: There has been no court decision that DACA is unconstitutional.
1.10.1.6.4.1. Pro: A [lawsuit](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/11/eric-schneiderman/has-daca-been-ruled-unconstitutional/) to challenge the 2012 DACA was dismissed for lack of standing, and that decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
1.10.1.6.5. Con: The legal authority for DACA originates from the [U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section Three](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii) which states that the President “shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Inherent in the function of this clause is the ability of the President to target some immigration cases for removal and to use prosecutorial discretion favourably in others.
1.10.1.6.6. Con: More than 100 immigration law [professors and scholars](https://pennstatelaw.psu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/pdfs/Immigrants/LawProfLetterDACAFinal8.13.pdf) wrote a letter to Trump providing legal analysis on the executive branch’s legal authority to implement DACA.
1.10.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.
1.10.1.8. Con: To punish DREAMers, but not punish the employers who hired their undocumented parents, would be unfair to them, as well as maintain a power structure that inherently disadvantages those with less agency and social mobility.
1.10.1.8.1. Con: That is an argument for punishing employers who hire undocumented workers, not for allowing undocumented workers to remain in the country in violation of U.S. immigration law.
1.10.2. Pro: Rewarding illegal immigration will only encourage more immigrants to attempt illegal methods in the future.
1.10.2.1. Con: Regardless of whether they may be granted citizenship on the other side, people will still opt to immigrate illegally if they feel that the situation they're walking into is better than the one they're coming from.
1.10.2.2. Con: To allow people who were brought in as children and have lived here essentially all their lives would not have that effect, as the amount of effort it would take to replicate the results would be too high for all but the most desperate to enter the country anyway.
1.10.2.3. Con: The reward of citizenship is not being offered to those who actively immigrated illegally, rather to those who had no say in the matter.
1.10.2.3.1. Con: Their parents of DACA recipients are rewarded by knowing that their children will be given citizenship via DACA amnesty. Other people will follow their lead hoping for citizenship for their own children who also will have "no say in the matter." The problem will be ongoing.
1.10.2.3.1.1. Con: Attempting to prevent a theoretical crime is no basis for actively carrying out a civil rights violation against an innocent individual.
1.10.2.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.
1.10.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.
1.10.2.4. Pro: Granting citizenship to DREAMers without securing America's borders incentivises further illegal immigration.
1.10.2.4.1. Pro: Granting DREAMers citizenship would be humane. But we have to look at this in the context of granting amnesty to generation after generation of illegal immigrants, coupled with failing to secure the border as promised, resulting in new generations of illegal immigrants. Then granting citizenship to DREAMers appears to be just another step in the severe miss-management of our country.
1.10.2.4.1.1. Con: Dreamers are part of the American society. Punishing them for the failure of politics is bad and immoral decision.
1.10.2.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.3.
1.10.2.4.2. Con: Securing the border is an expensive, difficult, long term endeavor. To delay granting DREAMers citizenship in the meantime is unnecessary and inhumane.
1.10.2.4.3. Con: There is no credible reason why these two ideas should be linked.
1.10.2.4.4. Con: Border security is a waste of resources that goes against the very idea of what it means to be an American.
1.10.2.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.2.1.
1.10.2.4.5. Con: Due to the [widespread](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/report-reveals-widespread-sexual-assault-in-immigration_us_590fc4d2e4b0f71180724604) [abuse](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/22/us-border-agent-sexually-assaults-teenage-sisters-texas), [and](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/oregon-ice-arrest-immigration.html) [dehumanization](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-border-patrol-mexico-water-bottles-video-migrants-kick-over-video-illegals-mexicans-hispanics-a8165591.html) [found](http://fox8.com/2018/01/16/ice-arrests-youngstown-business-owner-plans-to-deport-him/) among both the ICE, and border patrol, it is unclear whether more money and resources should be put into these organizations, or if they should exist at all.
1.10.2.4.5.1. Pro: A solution that requires civil rights abuses to be implemented is not a solution.
1.10.2.5. Pro: Since this policy will encourage more illegal immigration, it will also result in criminal gangs, that specialize in smuggling people into the United States, receiving more income.
1.10.2.6. Pro: Many human beings die or are seriously injured whilst trying to enter the USA illegally. Granting DREAMers citizenship status, is wrong, because it will result in more people being encouraged to take these risky journeys, and more people [dying](http://uk.businessinsider.com/how-undocumented-immigrants-travel-to-us-2017-12?r=US&IR=T/#while-some-leave-looking-for-work-others-are-fleeing-domestic-or-gang-related-violence-this-guatemalan-woman-was-fleeing-an-abusive-husband-with-her-two-small-children-a-sister-and-a-male-relative-frankfurter-met-them-in-arriaga-9) as a result.
1.10.2.6.1. Pro: 80% of women and girls illegally crossing the border are raped.  It is immoral to facilitate a system in which a parent would knowingly put their child in this situation.[huffingtonpost.com](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/central-america-migrants-rape_n_5806972.html)
1.10.2.6.2. Con: There is no connection between children that are currently in the United States being granted the OPPORTUNITY to gain citizenship status and new illegal immigrants. To hold children of the past accountable for the actions of adults in the future is highly immoral and illogical. 
Further, the parents made the risk to illegally immigrate because it was that dangerous where they came from. This IS child protection in their case.
1.10.2.7. Pro: Parents have the potential to be rewarded, because once their child becomes a citizen, they can sponsor their parent's citizenship application.
1.10.2.7.1. Pro: Many parents travel to the US illegally to give birth so that their children gain US citizenship. Such [Anchor Babies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2016/10/05/the-citizenship-and-immigration-problems-of-anchor-babies-and-surrogacy/#437d4d8755b3) are then able to sponsor their parents' citizenship applications once the child is an adult citizen.
1.10.2.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.
1.10.2.8. Pro: [The 1986](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/not-so-beautiful-dreamers-the-reality-behind-the-media-airbrushing) Immigration Reform and Control Act which provided citizenship to 2.7 million illegal aliens encouraged many more immigrants to enter the US illegally. The US government should learn from this previous experience.
1.10.2.8.1. Con: Correlation does not equal causation. The 1986 act was followed by a number of policy changes, including the ratification of NAFTA, which devastated Mexican agriculture and caused a mass exodus from of rural Mexico.
1.10.2.9. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.
1.10.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.10.4. Con: America's current set of immigration laws violate the 14th amendment by having an immutable characteristic as a necessary condition for conviction. Such laws can not possibly provide equal protection.
1.10.4.1. Con: Non-citizens are not protected by the US Constitution to the same degree and in the same ways as citizens.
1.10.4.1.1. Pro: The Constitution provides specific privileges and protections to citizens that it does not extend to non-citizens.
1.10.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.1.
1.10.4.1.2. Con: If a person follows the laws, and thus is granted entry, their human rights should also be protected
1.10.4.1.2.1. Con: It is not a human right to live in a country you are not a citizen of. One might want to live in the south of France, but  France won't let someone stay just because they want to. They also won't let someone stay if they get a visitors visa and overstay their welcome.  As soon as they are discovered they will be deported.  No person has the right to live somewhere just because they want to.
1.10.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: This is the way in which nearly every country works so as to avoid overpopulation, potential security threats, resource shortages, etc. Strict guidelines on citizenship aren't put in place with the intention of oppressing people, but rather to ensure that the nation runs as smoothly as possible by sustaining its industries/economy so it can provide the best possible quality of life for those within its borders.
1.10.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The US is not at risk of overpopulation.
1.10.4.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The US is currently #179 in population density, and largely made of of fertile farm land.
1.10.4.1.2.1.1.2. Con: There are almost no known instances of overpopulation caused by migration, especially in a place like the United States.
1.10.4.1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: In fact, more frequently it is the case that overpopulation is a [cause of migration](http://consensusforaction.stanford.edu/blog/population-growth-is-drivin.html) rather than being an effect of it.
1.10.4.1.2.1.1.3. Con: People consider population density when making decisions about moving.
1.10.4.1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: This presumes that the people migrating have the luxury of choice; and while some do, many migrants--especially the parents of DREAMers--are simply trying to escape from dangerous situations and thus migrate to whichever country they can that provides better life options.
1.10.4.1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: In the case of Central American migrants, many of them opt to go to the US because geographically it makes the most sense vs. other developed countries.
1.10.4.1.2.1.1.4. Con: Why something is done, and what effect it has on people are only tangentially related.
1.10.4.1.2.1.1.5. Pro: Since Lebanon has kept its borders open to those fleeing the violence in Syria, 30% of its current total population is now comprised of Syrian refugees. Although this is morally respectable, as a result of the [sudden overpopulation](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/humanitarian-crisis-impact-syrian-refugees-lebanon) nearly every sector of society has been affected; and both Lebanese nationals and refugees alike are suffering from the pressures of resource shortages.
1.10.4.1.2.1.1.5.1. Con: The problem is the sudden influx rather then the total population, since of course adding half the country's population overnight will put strain on infrastructure made to support only minimal growth. But the United states is so big and populated, it would take a multinational coordinated attack to break our infrastructure via immigration.
1.10.4.1.2.1.1.5.1.1. Con: A [single cyber-attack](https://www.cfr.org/report/cyberattack-us-power-grid) that disrupts or takes down the US power grid is all that would be needed to significantly harm US infrastructure; a multinational coordinated attack is not necessary.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2. Con: According to [The Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), there are fundamental rights to which all peoples from all nations are entitled.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: UDHR articles 7, 9, 13, and 15, all either outline the right to live, and immigrate to another country, or necessarily require such a right.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: UDHR articles 1-3, 5-12, 16-20, and 22-29 are specifically directed to the idea that when someone crosses a border, they keep all rights and legal protections.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3. Con: The [UDHR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) is not legally binding.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.1. Con: The lack of legal enforcement arises because there are no feasible mechanisms of international enforcement. The documents are still meant, on a principled level, to be morally and legally binding.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.2. Pro: Signing off on an agreement may denote setting an arbitrary moral standard that countries do not mean to bind themselves by.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Even if the UK [added parts](https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/human-rights-act) of the ECHR to their constitution thereby binding their government, the rest of the ECHR has only a [persuasive impact](https://definitions.uslegal.com/p/persuasive-authority/) on UK legislation. This shows that countries can limit the effect International agreements have on them.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.2.2. Con: Signing the UDHR is best seen as a promise - a signal of one's intention that is not legally binding, but is still morally important.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.2.2.1. Con: Signing the UDHR without committing to them legally signals that countries want to appear morally good, but that they would not actually act morally if doing so would be inconvenient to them.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Signing the UDHR without completely committing to them in practice signals the intent and desire for the articles within them, but with the recognition that upholding them may be difficult at times.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.2.3. Con: -> See 1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.1.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.2.4. Con: The shortcomings of others do not justify our own.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.3. Con: The UDHR has been used as the base of many legally binding international agreements.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.1. Pro: The UDHR definitions of fundamental freedoms and human rights is used in the [United Nations Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights#Significance_and_legal_effect), which is binding on all member states.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.2. Pro: After the Second World War, the countries of the world agreed they have a responsibility to help those fleeing persecution in their states and signed the [United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees) in 1951.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3. Pro: The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights \([ICESCR\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights) is a multilateral treaty adopted by the UN's General Assembly in 1966. It commits its parties to work toward the granting of economic, social, and cultural rights.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.4. Pro: The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \([ICCPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights)\) is a multilateral treaty adopted by the UN's General Assembly. It commits its parties to respect the civil and political rights of individuals.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.5. Con: Many of these agreements are either ineffective, counterproductive, openly ignored or otherwise flawed. They do not provide adequate legal accountability for nations breaking these treaties.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.5.1. Pro: [The Dublin regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Regulation#Criticism) fails to provide fair, efficient and effective protection for refugees. The regulation is criticized as undermining refugee rights.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.5.2. Pro: The [UN Human Rights Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Committee) that is tasked with holding member states accountable to the international treaties on human rights is very ineffective.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.5.2.1. Pro: When [Libya](https://clg.portalxm.com/library/keytext.cfm?keytext_id=122) submitted an arguably dishonest report in 1995 - while at the same time persecuting expatriate dissidents - it took the committee three years to formulate an answer which expressed concern over the assassinations of dissidents. Libya ignored the comments and was elected chair of the committee in 2003.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.5.2.2. Pro: The committee has been [criticized](https://clg.portalxm.com/library/keytext.cfm?keytext_id=122) for meeting too infrequently, does not hold hearings, and lacks adversarial procedures. It relies on states' self-reporting.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.5.3. Con: -> See 1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.1.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.6. Pro: The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \(UNHCR\) was created in 1951 and was put in charge of protecting refugees and finding solutions for their future.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.4. Con: -> See 1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.2.2.
1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.5. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.2.
1.10.4.1.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.10.4.1.2.1.2.3.2.4.
1.10.4.1.2.2. Pro: Being forced to follow laws one can not use to seek protection results in one losing rights.
1.10.4.2. Con: Immigration laws differentiate between citizens and non-citizens. Being a non-citizen is not an immutable characteristic.
1.10.4.2.1. Con: One's country of birth is an immutable characteristic.
1.10.4.2.1.1. Pro: Since a person cannot change the country in which they were born, such a characteristic is immutable.
1.10.4.2.1.2. Con: Countries have always discriminated against non-citizens.
1.10.4.2.1.2.1. Con: The fact that something currently or always happens, is not a reason that it should happen.
1.10.4.2.1.2.1.1. Con: But countries exist for good reasons.  Before we all tear down our fences maybe we should stop and ask why do those fences exist.
1.10.4.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Countries first formed because people gathered in different parts of the world, counted because of the logistical difficulties of managing over great distances and natural divides, and exist now only do to some petty differences, or remnant power structures we have yet to work out, none of these reasons are sufficient to turn away a hard workers who come to your door for your culture.
1.10.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.10.4.1.2.1.1.
1.10.4.2.2. Pro: An immutable characteristic is something which cannot be changed. As someone can change from being a non citizen into being a citizen it is very clearly not an immutable characteristic.
1.10.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.4.2.1.
1.10.4.4. Con: Immigration laws discriminate against country of origin and citizenship not country of birth.
1.10.4.4.1. Pro: Neither of these characteristics are immutable since they can be changed.
1.10.4.4.1.1. Con: By that logic, voter literacy tests were not discriminatory, even with the grandfather clause, as a person could still pass them if they happened to have the random bits of information required.
1.10.4.4.1.1.1. Con: There is a difference between a law that is discriminatory, and a law that discriminates against an immutable characteristic.
1.10.4.4.2. Con: People born within the US are given an unfair advantage in the process of legal residence, as such, the existence of immigration laws does discriminate on the basis of country of birth.
1.10.5. Con: Granting citizenship to DREAMers would not be rewarding the illegal action, since it would not directly reward their parents, who would not enjoy the same legal protections as the DREAMers.
1.10.5.1. Con: -> See 1.10.2.3.1.
1.10.5.2. Con: -> See 1.10.2.7.
1.10.6. Pro: Illegal immigration functions similar to the crime of theft, and no one should profit from theft. If a person robbed a bank and the children were living off the robbery money, they would have to return the money to those who suffered a loss.
1.10.6.1. Con: There is no victim.
1.10.6.1.1. Con: There are plenty of victims. All law-abiding citizens are paying for the infrastructure and political system for the immigrants to enjoy. All law-abiding immigrants are unjustifiably delayed and cramped out of the sequence. All law abiding foreigners who want to be an immigrant are unfairly left out.
1.10.7. Con: Rewarding an illegal action is not necessarily bad/morally wrong.
1.10.7.1. Con: Rewarding illegal actions breaks down the rule of law. We can't have books on the law that we ignore. We should get rid of laws we don't like.
1.10.7.2. Pro: If a law is onerous enough there is nothing wrong with breaking it or ignoring it. As an extreme example no one thinks run-away slaves or those that helped were bad even though they were breaking the laws of the time.
1.10.7.2.1. Con: The right way was to abolish slavery, which US did.
1.10.8. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.
1.10.9. Con: It is not reasonable to expect a child to know how to or be able too resist committing a procedural crime.
1.11. Con: Granting DREAMers citizenship could significantly [alter](https://vittana.org/15-pros-and-cons-of-the-dream-act) the political structure of the US.
1.11.1. Con: It is a gross oversimplification to think all Dreamers would end up being Democratic party voters. For one, this generalization fails to factor in the often deeply conservative Christian \(and family\) values that many Dreamers have adopted from their families. Let's give Dreamers the respect we demand for ourselves - that we can \(and do\) make up our own minds about how to vote on issues that are important to us.
1.11.1.1. Con: Seeing that the Democratic Party is the one championing the DREAMers cause, it is fair to expect that the majority of them will start out voting Democratic.
1.11.2. Pro: People who got into this country illegally, by their very presence, are adding themselves to the political landscape illegally. If the numbers are large, this adds up to an illegal political revolution.
1.11.2.1. Con: This suggests that a person's very existence within a country is viable to be politicized by no other merit than their presence alone.  Such thinking is ultimately what creates the politicization to begin with.
1.11.2.2. Con: Just like other non-citizens, those who are here illegally are unable to vote and therefore lack the power to actually enact any political change.
1.11.2.3. Con: The entire merit of this argument seems to rest upon saying the word 'illegal' as many times as possible. The word 'illegal' is not a valid argument.
1.11.3. Pro: The [majority](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/who-and-where-dreamers-are-revised-estimates) of DREAMers are Latino, and statistically the [majority](http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/10/11/latinos-and-the-political-parties/) of Latino voters lean Democrat. Therefore granting DREAMers citizenship could garner millions more votes for the Democratic party.
1.11.3.1. Con: Claiming that a population leans politically one way or another is not relevant in an immigration debate. Political parties can change their platforms and attract new voters.
1.11.3.1.1. Con: When an outside population comes in and changes the political balance, that is relevant because it changes the character of the country. It is especially relevant if the people came here illegally.
1.11.3.1.1.1. Con: Not necessarily, especially when those who entered deliberate in an illegal fashion would never be eligible to vote anyway unless they left and came back by legal means.
1.11.3.2. Pro: California's Latino population boomed in the 1990's and California turned \(some would say irreversibly\) Democratic.
1.11.3.2.1. Con: This not only generalizes all Latinos as likely democratic voters, but also generalizes all whites as likely republican voters.  Such generalization ill suits both groups as Latinos like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are just as capable of conservative ideals as Whites like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are capable of liberal ideals.
1.11.3.3. Con: While this blatantly ignores that there may be a reason for such a trend, to exclude a group because of the trend would be just as politically corrupt as exclusively filling immigration quotas with said group to stack the electoral deck.
1.11.3.4. Con: There are over [230,000,000](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/turnout.php) citizens of eligible voting age in the US, therefore the addition of [up to 3.6 million](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/01/18/there-3-5-m-dreamers-and-most-may-face-nightmare/1042134001/) DREAMers will hardly be enough to change the political landscape of the country.
1.11.3.4.1. Con: Elections are often determined by [swing states](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/09/28/why-are-swing-states-important/) with very close margins. Several thousand votes would be capable of significantly altering election results.
1.11.3.4.1.1. Con: That is an issue with the electoral college system rather than freshly anointed voters.  [Feel free to discuss here.](https://www.kialo.com/should-the-electoral-college-be-abolished-2469/2469.0=2469.1)
1.11.3.4.1.2. Con: States that have higher populations of DREAMers [tend not to be swing states](https://qz.com/1069844/who-are-the-dreamers-and-where-do-they-live/) \(and this trend has been [consistent for years](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/who-and-where-dreamers-are-revised-estimates).\)
1.11.3.5. Con: If the Republican party were to grant DREAMers citizenship it may cause some of the DREAMers to support them in the future.
1.11.3.5.1. Con: This would also involve fundamentally altering the Republican platform to such an extent that they would no longer be Republican anymore.
1.11.3.5.1.1. Con: Most people support the DREAMers, and many other policies that are at the core of the Republican political identity, if the GOP wants to represent people, as it says it does, it should change, even if that change is significant.
1.11.3.5.1.1.1. Con: This is like saying if Republicans adopted liberal policies, more liberals would vote for them. While true, it would also be completely pointless for Republicans to do.
1.11.3.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Although people object to a good deal of Republican ideas, they do not object to all of them, they can adapt, and save what they can, and might even be valuable, or become universally despised, and have whatever good the public might have seen in there point be thrown out with the bathwater of their dated ideas.
1.11.3.5.1.2. Pro: Political parties generally represent principles and ideals for moral, not just practical reasons.
1.11.3.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.5.1.1.1.
1.11.3.6. Con: This is flat-out, unapologetic, racism.
1.11.3.7. Con: Latino's are not monotonically democratic. For instance there are a lot of Cuban Republicans. As such, it is not certain that Latino's will sway the US left or right, given that the Right doesn't alienate Latino's by refusing many of them citizenship. This argument is therefore a self-fulfilling prophecy.
1.11.4. Con: An awful lot of the weight of this argument would seem to fall upon sweeping generalizations about people, mostly based upon their country of origin, in other words, xenophobia. We as a planet have all agreed to put xenophobia in the waste bin with racism, and eugenics.
1.11.5. Con: A change in the political structure of the US might be beneficial.
1.11.5.1. Pro: The point of accepting immigrants is to alter the political structure. Allowing them to participate helps to include outside opinion in our system, which improves our national responses in foreign policy, as opposed to insulating the US view on any given topic, and increasing the risk of conflict.
1.11.5.1.1. Con: The purpose of immigration is to bring beneficial ideas, knowledge, and skills into the nation. It should have nothing to do with altering the national's political structure.
1.11.5.1.2. Con: The above statement says that it is good that new people come into our country because they will change our country for the better. However, under our system of government, what is better for the country should be decided by the voting process \(reserved for citizens\) and by our laws. People who arrived here illegally are changing our country illegally.
1.11.5.1.2.1. Con: If a child is brought up in the US and has lived their entire lives there, then they would inherently have a similar outlook to citizens who would have been raised in similar circumstances. The only difference, in this case, would be that the US would no longer be marginalising them, as they would now accept them as citizens and be open to their participation in American society which would be legal once they are citizens.
1.11.5.1.3. Con: The point of relatively free immigration is the financial betterment of a society through the addition of workers in labor markets that would otherwise starve, and the creation of new industries by equipping the brightest of other nations with resources for inspiration.  Politics has nothing to do with it, unless the current administration is crooked.
1.11.5.2. Pro: The structure of the United States is not set in stone, nor should it be. We tried keeping an equal balance of power in the years of slavery, and that was a complete, unmitigated disaster.
1.11.5.3. Pro: The current political structure in the US is unfair given that it does not offer representation to a large segment of people who reside in the US and for most intents and purposes should be US citizens but are not. If Republicans are worried about increasing Democrat-leaning citizens through DACA citizenship they should try to make their political positions more immigrant-friendly. They already appeal to many latinos for their conservative principles towards religion and family values.
1.11.5.3.1. Con: The U.S. political structure should give representation to citizens of the U.S.  There is a legal immigration system and these individuals have not used it.  Until they successfully pass through the legal immigration system, they should not be represented by the political structure of the country.
1.11.5.3.2. Pro: Democrat voters may increase if a DREAM Act is passed, not due to an influx of newly naturalized voters but rather because of higher turnout/more left leaning Latinx-American voters who identify with the Democrats' pro-immigrant platform.
1.11.6. Con: Granting these voters citizenship is no different from granting citizenship through America's history to German, Irish, Italian  Puerto Rican, or other ethnicities. The idea that citizens of different ethnicities would vote one way or another does not justify denying them that right and is, historically, unethical.
1.11.6.1. Con: This implies there is no difference between legal and illegal immigration.
1.11.6.1.1. Con: Effectively, there is not.  Once a family has been rooted in a country long enough, it does not matter how the family head entered said country.
1.11.6.2. Pro: America is a melting pot of different cultures. The inclusion of further cultures works in with America's history and makeup.
1.11.6.2.1. Pro: With the exception of Native Americans, most American citizens today are in some way descended from immigrants.
1.12. Pro: Granting DREAMers citizenship would improve the US' global reputation.
1.12.1. Pro: Giving DREAMers U.S. citizenship would make the country a safe haven for Middle Eastern refugees, and countries like North Korea and Russia would be internationally disliked for attacking the US.
1.12.1.1. Con: [Less than 1%](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/who-and-where-dreamers-are-revised-estimates) of the current DREAMer population is from the Middle East, which means that the number of Middle Easterners that would benefit from granting DREAMers citizenship is negligible.
1.12.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.7.1.3.
1.12.1.3. Con: Neither Russia nor North Korea are currently attacking the US \(nor is there an imminent threat of attack\), therefore it is unnecessary to grant DREAMers citizenship as a means to create a deterrent to a nonexistent problem.
1.12.1.3.1. Con: [Russia has successfully launched co-ordinated attacks upon the US democracy, albeit without the use of armed forces.](https://swalwell.house.gov/issues/russia-2016-us-election-interference)
1.12.2. Pro: [Data](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/17/donald-trump-america-reputation) shows that countries with a greater reputation abroad aren’t necessarily the richest, most modern, most powerful or most attractive countries. Prestige abroad actually correlates with how admirable the countries actions are seen to be. Kindness to immigrants who grew up in America would therefore aid in the US's reputation abroad which is currently in danger.
1.12.2.1. Pro: The 2018 Best Countries [rankings](https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2018-01-26/americas-reputation-at-home-and-abroad-is-falling) have the United States dropping to eighth place, down from seventh in 2017 and fourth in 2016 before Trump took office. Reputation abroad is even more important now during this period of decline and should be taken into consideration in high profile decisions such as the DREAMers.
1.12.2.1.1. Pro: Each ranking drop in a country’s reputation is associated with a decrease in export volume of [2 percent](http://theconversation.com/americas-worsening-global-reputation-could-put-billions-in-us-exports-at-risk-78152).
1.12.2.2. Con: The reputation are merely some propaganda for people to feel good, rather than actually helping. This kind of mentality is shallow and mere vanity.
1.12.3. Pro: Granting citizenship to DREAMers would make the US appear empathetic and humanitarian, which would be a positive boost to the country's image since they are widely perceived to be a global aggressor.
1.12.4. Pro: Deportation could harm the US' global reputation.
1.12.4.1. Pro: Taking into consideration the power of social media in this day and age the deportation of DREAMers may be more detrimental to the USA's reputation. With every DREAMer deported there will be another personal story shared online rising the sympathies of those abroad.
1.12.4.2. Pro: Experts [predicted](http://theconversation.com/americas-worsening-global-reputation-could-put-billions-in-us-exports-at-risk-78152) the U.S. would receive 4.3 million fewer visitors in 2017 than in 2016, in part because changes to immigration policies were making tourists feel unwelcome. Deporting DREAMers would only exacerbate this situation.
1.12.4.2.1. Con: Lawlessness will hurt tourism even more.
1.12.4.2.1.1. Con: Tourism in Mexico has [increased](https://tradingeconomics.com/mexico/tourist-arrivals) steadily over the past several years, despite the country's concurrently [increasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Mexico) crime rates.
1.12.4.3. Pro: The immigration system needs to be responsibly reformed, but deporting people who have invested their whole life in the country is not how you fix the system. It only makes the US appear hateful.
1.12.4.4. Con: Unless Congress pass the law for amnesty, deportation according to the law has nothing to do with reputation. Every country in the world enforce their own law. Mexico has harsher immigration law than the U.S.
1.12.5. Con: Rewarding illegal behavior is not a good reputation.
1.13. Pro: There are Constitutional arguments for granting them citizenship.
1.13.1. Pro: America's current method of determining many protections, such as voting, violate the 14th amendment by having an immutable characteristic, country of origin, as a grandfather clause. Voting is a form of protection under this law, and granting a particular group special treatment to access it is incompatible with equitable protection.
1.13.1.1. Con: The Supreme Court has never interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment as denying Congress' plenary power, derived from Article I, Section 8, to make laws determining the requirements for naturalization and citizenship. Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 530–31. As interpreted, the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses apply only to the States. However, the Fifth Amendment's Due Process clause has been held to follow the interpretation of the Fourteenth. See Malinski v. New York.
1.13.1.1.1. Con: A necessary precondition of Article I Section 8 is that the law be applied uniformly. A law that discriminates on the basis of national origin is non-uniform.
1.13.1.1.2. Con: Given the growing emphasis America has put on equal protection since ratifying the 14th amendment, it is almost certain that if a case were to go before the court today, state would be interpreted by the fifth definition [here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/state), the US is a nation state, instead of the seventh. To interpret it otherwise would be to allow the nation to discriminate on the basis of gender or skin color, as the part pertaining to United States only deals with citizenship, and that simply will not happen.
1.13.1.1.2.1. Con: The United States Congress has plenary power over determining the basis of entry into the United States. Currently the INA prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, or marital status. 8 U.S.C. § 1422. But, that the Congress may discriminate on the basis of one's state of origin is an inherent and absolute power and one of the basic tenants of sovereignty. Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 530–531 \(1954\).
1.13.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The INA is not a court case, but a law made by congress, and a law made by congress can be repealed by congress. There is nothing, save for a broad interpretation of the equal protection clause, that protects anyone, foreign or domestic from congress's ability to discriminate on any bases.
1.13.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Galvan did not file motions on the grounds of the fourteenth amendment, therefore, it's application could not be considered by the courts. They were ruling on, and only on, the application of ex post facto.
1.13.1.2. Pro: In the past, undocumented immigrants were even allowed the [ballot](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2016/11/the-long-strange-history-of-non-citizen-voting/504974/).
1.13.2. Pro: DREAMers live under the same conditions and jurisdiction as citizens, as well as share and are embedded within daily life of the United States; therefore by the 14th Amendment, they should be granted legal citizenship.
1.13.2.1. Pro: The most well known [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/naturalize) of naturalization is the first, but this can not possibly be the one meant because it makes no sense. 'Anyone who is under US jurisdiction, and a citizen should become a citizen' isn't exactly something that needs to be spelled out. No, the only sensible definition in this situation is the forth. Protecting those who are so intertwined in the fabric of the US is a worthy goal, and, evidently, one worth stating plainly.
1.13.2.2. Pro: The original intention of this amendment was to guarantee the citizenship of ex-slaves, some of which were born in Africa, and some not born there. They were interwoven into the tapestry of America, often over decades but were in no way legal citizens. This amendment sought to guarantee no group would be subject to laws that would not protect them, by forgetting this, the US have allowed it to happen again.
1.13.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.4.
1.14. Pro: The US should make laws consistent with the will of the people, and the people [want](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/28/fox-news-poll-83-percent-support-pathway-to-citizenship-for-illegal-immigrants.html) DREAMers to be full citizens.
1.14.1. Pro: A people should/would always want its citizens to be full participants in society. We have seen what happens when we exclude people based on gender, race, socioeconomics. Have we not learned?
1.14.1.1. Con: This is not about race or gender. It is about basic immigration no matter what the nationality.
1.14.2. Pro: Support for allowing DREAMers to remain in the U.S. spans [across](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/05/poll-trump-deporting-daca-dreamers-242343) party lines: 84 percent of Democrats, 74 percent of independents and 69 percent of Republicans think they should stay. Given the deeply polarizing nature of immigration issues, this broad support is notable.
1.15. Con: DREAMers could be a potential security risk to the nation and should not be allowed to stay.
1.15.1. Con: In order to be eligible for DACA, applicants were [required](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/31/16226934/daca-trump-dreamers-immigration) to have clean criminal records and also be enrolled in high school \(or already possess a diploma/equivalent\).
1.15.2. Con: This would only justify deporting those individuals who pose a security risk and not all DREAMers.
1.15.3. Con: If they pose a threat to security, the relevant law enforcement agency is capable of handling them.
1.15.4. Con: If the right to stay in the US were based simply upon how much of a threat someone was, we would also have to deport many native born US citizens
1.15.5. Con: Removing these children constitutes a threat to the safety and security of the United States.  We would be sending a group of people with college degrees, training \(in some cases, in the military\), and a fresh hatred of the United States into the hands of terrorists and foreign powers.
1.15.6. Con: The native-born incarceration rate is [14](https://www.cato.org/publications/immigration-research-policy-brief/dreamer-incarceration-rate) percent higher than the DREAMer incarceration rate, while DACA-ineligible illegal immigrants and legal immigrants have the lowest rates of all.
1.15.6.1. Con: Since illegal immigrants face the threat of deportation, they have a significant incentive to avoid law enforcement, particularly when such law enforcement may be biased against them.
1.15.6.1.1. Con: It is unclear why the reason behind varying immigrant vs. native incarceration rates should matter in this instance.
1.15.6.1.1.1. Con: Crimes are detrimental to society even if they aren't discovered by law enforcement.
1.15.6.2. Con: Whether or not they've been incarcerated, all illegal immigrants have committed a felony by living in the U.S. illegally.
1.15.6.2.1. Con: Children brought to a country illegally have not committed a crime and should not be punished.
1.15.6.2.1.1. Con: Staying in a country without a visa or citizenship is a [civil offence](https://immigration.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=000781).
1.15.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Littering is also a crime, and is punished similarly.
1.15.6.2.1.1.2. Con: This says entering the country, or not keeping appointments with ICE is a crime, not that staying in the country is.
1.15.6.3. Pro: The incarceration rate for DREAMers is closer to that of native-born Americans because they came here at a younger age and are more assimilated into American culture.
1.15.7. Con: This argument is largely unsupported and motivated by [racial profiles and stereotypes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/09/when-trump-says-illegals-immigrant-advocates-recoil-he-would-have-been-all-right-in-1970/?utm_term=.a85d02965d10).
1.15.7.1. Con: Stereotypes, as generalizations based on experience, can often be [relevant and statistically validated](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jussim/Unbearable%20II.pdf).
1.15.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.15.6.
1.15.7.1.2. Con: Stereotypes effect how we see the world, which, in turn, effects how we act upon the world, we are more likely to see actions that reinforce our views, and act upon them, which then creates the appearance that the stereotype is valid.
1.15.7.1.2.1. Pro: [Studies](https://www.npr.org/2015/09/01/436525758/how-teachers-unconscious-bias-play-into-the-hands-ofgender-disparity) show that teachers tend to grade the performance of men above what they deserve on math, and science, and grade women below what they have truly earned.
1.15.7.1.3. Con: Stereotypes tell us, in a very real way, who we are supposed to be. They can actively shape our minds, and every aspect of our life, attempting to mold us to fit a label. [Take gender for example.](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/09/556116385/nature-nurture-and-our-evolving-debates-about-gender) Things that are only true because we think they are true are not good mirrors for reality.
1.15.8. Pro: Unlike refugees, who undergo intense background checks by both the United Nations and U.S. officials, DACA beneficiaries received much [lighter background checks](https://www.lifezette.com/polizette/unconsidered-daca-risk-national-security-threats/).  Unless they were to conduct further background checks before granting citizenship they could be potential security risks.
1.15.8.1. Pro: [Vaughan](https://www.lifezette.com/polizette/unconsidered-daca-risk-national-security-threats/), a former foreign service officer with the State Department, said Barack Obama's administration held DACA applications to "almost laughable" standards. She said USCIS officials did not review original documents, only scanned materials. That made it harder to determine whether a document was a forgery.
1.15.8.2. Con: -> See 1.8.9.3.
1.15.8.3. Pro: [DACA applicants](https://citizenpath.com/what-happens-after-filing-i-821d-daca-application/) are only fingerprinted in order to have a criminal background check. In contrast, Refugees [undergo](https://mic.com/articles/167047/what-does-vetting-mean-heres-what-the-us-process-for-screening-immigrants-and-refugees-looks-like#.wnU8L7hkB) a series of interviews and their backgrounds are thoroughly analysed.
1.15.8.3.1. Pro: Looking at numerous aspects of a persons life rather than simply whether they have been previously discovered to have committed a crime provides a clearer picture of their suitability to be a citizen.
1.15.8.3.2. Pro: The government ran the applicant's' fingerprints through an FBI database but conducted no face to face interviews or review of the [records](https://www.lifezette.com/polizette/unconsidered-daca-risk-national-security-threats/) they submitted.
1.15.9. Con: This claim is based on an assumption that people in a certain situation will act like criminals, and a further assumption as to how criminals would act.
