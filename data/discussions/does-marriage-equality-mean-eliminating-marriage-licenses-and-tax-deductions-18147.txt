Discussion Title: Does Marriage Equality Mean Eliminating Marriage Licenses And Tax Deductions?

1. Marriage equality means eliminating marriage licenses and special tax deductions for married couples.
1.1. Pro: This would dramatically reduce the opportunities for the government to deny couples legal recognition and the rights associated with it.
1.1.1. Con: If foiled in one area, the government may find other ways to exert control over couples.
1.1.2. Pro: Only [twenty-six](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/08/08/gay-marriage-around-the-world-2013/) countries in the world allow same sex marriage. The rest only facilitate heterosexual marriages.
1.1.3. Con: The unfairness visited upon some relationships now is that they are not recognised. Refusing to recognise any relationship or provide them with support makes no one better off.
1.2. Pro: If marriage is an inherently religious institution, then the government has absolutely no business regulating it.
1.2.1. Con: Religion is less of a motivating factor for marriage than ever before. This is supported by the smaller and smaller proportion of marriages which have a [religious](http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2015-07-21-just-one-three-weddings-england-and-wales-has-religious-ceremony#) ceremony.
1.2.2. Pro: A proper separation of church and state is [required](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-the-separation-of-church-and-state-249635) so that the religious beliefs of some are not prioritised at the expense of others.
1.3. Pro: Marriage is different across religious faiths or a lack thereof. When the government grants licenses to one type of marriage and not another, it could be argued it is establishing a state religion.
1.3.1. Pro: Marriage laws in countries such as the [UK](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN05051/SN05051.pdf) and much of the [US](https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/family-law/matrimonial-law/i-do-i-do-i-do-is-polygamy-legal.html) prohibit polygamous marriage. This means that they favour certain religious conceptions of marriage over others.
1.3.1.1. Con: Traditional polygyny is harmful.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Polygyny can [increase crime.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/07/polygamy-national-security-putin-120234)
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The institution causes [problems](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/01/the_problem_with_polygamy.html) for the young, low-status males denied wives by older, wealthy men who have hoarded all the women. And those young men create problems for everybody.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Polygyny is less about sex than it is [about power.](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/01/the_problem_with_polygamy.html) Rich old guys with lots of wives win twice: They have more women to bear them babies and do household work, and they also gain an advantage over other men.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: Children [tend to suffer](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/01/the_problem_with_polygamy.html) in polygynyous families.
1.3.1.1.4. Pro: Polygynous families tend to foster jealousy and resentments among spouses.
1.3.1.1.4.1. Pro: Ethnography [studies of 69 countries](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3773961?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) reveal "no case where co-wife relations could be described as harmonious”.
1.3.1.1.5. Con: 50,000 men and women in the U.S [wan](https://www.bustle.com/articles/88150-acceptance-of-polygamy-has-more-than-doubled-in-america-new-gallup-poll-finds-plus-6-things)t to practice polygamy. It is unfair not to support whatever form of relationship they wish to consent into.
1.3.1.1.5.1. Pro: Open relationships are [on the increase](https://bigthink.com/paul-ratner/non-monogamous-relationships-on-the-rise-among-young-americans).
1.3.1.1.6. Con: Many of the problems that come along with polygamy are from unethical labor practices and domestic abuse. These can continue to be illegal and monitored while still allowing consenting couples to live in this fashion.
1.3.1.1.7. Con: This can be combatted by legalising and promoting open relationships which aren't exclusively polygynous.
1.3.2. Con: It is not wrong to support religions. The issue is only created when certain religions are excluded arbitrarily.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Many countries fund religious [schools](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2017/06/27/can-religious-schools-receive-state-funds-supreme-court-gives-qualified), allow tax [exemptions](https://www.thoughtco.com/religious-tax-exemptions-overview-249595) to religion, and even have [official](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/10/03/many-countries-favor-specific-religions-officially-or-unofficially/) religions.
1.3.2.2. Con: The prevalence, or perceived legitimacy, of different ceremonies is currently mandated by a biased sourced. If governments were able to be impartial, it wouldn't matter; they cannot.
1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.
1.4. Pro: The government should not be involved in an institution that perpetuates inequality.
1.4.1. Pro: Marriage has long history of entrenching sexism, and it continues to do so to this day.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Originally, marriage was a way in which men could effectively control women, and the continuation of their estate through [contract](https://www.ancient.eu/article/688/love-sex-and-marriage-in-ancient-mesopotamia/).
1.4.1.1.1. Con: It is misleading to say that marriage was exclusively a business contract, although many marriages were.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Before the welfare state, and when women were virtually banned from employment, economic necessity forced them into marriage as a way to gain financial [stability.](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/first-comes-love-then-comes-marriage-not-for-me-thanks/news-story/d53ae485a9015c0562b3f054427796f4?nk=59bc468657ac662a5b14582cd249552f-1535819079)
1.4.1.2. Pro: Wedding ceremonies are laced with [symbolism](https://www.bustle.com/articles/146884-5-wedding-traditions-that-reinforce-gender-inequality) that reinforces gender inequality.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Marriages between wealthy individuals have contributed hugely to income [inequality](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/upshot/marriages-of-power-couples-reinforce-income-inequality.html) across our society.
1.4.2. Pro: In some households filing jointly can be a disincentive for [secondary income earners](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/margaret-ryznar/fixing-the-marriage-penal_b_8290820.html) to earn a higher salary.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Across the globe, women spend more time completing unpaid labour than their male partners. [Charmes p 20](http://www.hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/charmes_hdr_2015_final.pdf)
1.4.3. Pro: No matter what form of marriage is supported by the state, some people will be unable to opt into it. It is unfair to exclude them.
1.5. Con: Eliminating marriage licenses leaves marriage open to fraud and abuse.
1.5.1. Pro: Without government involvement people can marry non-existing personas.
1.6. Pro: The largest reason state governments have to require marriage licenses is for tax purposes. Eliminating special treatment of married couples in the tax code removes a huge portion of the reasoning behind licenses.
1.6.1. Pro: Special treatment for married couples in the tax code gives people who don't want certain people to get married a claim to have an interest in other people's relationships. For example: "If they get married, they'll pay less in taxes. Therefore their marriage is absolutely my business!" Take that away, they have no reason \(beyond just a personal distaste\) to have any say in what other couples do.
1.6.1.1. Con: Even without state recognition, marriage is recognised as a religious and cultural [institution](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/philosophicalfragments/2011/07/14/what-really-is-the-institution-of-marriage/).
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: This makes many people feel that they have a vested interest in the institution of marriage. Even if the state had no part in it, they would be incensed by what they see as it's [collapse](https://www.religion-online.org/article/the-collapse-of-marriage/).
1.6.1.2. Pro: State support makes marriage a public service rather than simply a [contract](http://time.com/3939374/rand-paul-gay-marriage-supreme-court/) between two people. This is why the U.S. Supreme Court decision to legalise gay marriage was viewed as court overreach.
1.6.2. Pro: This would also simplify the tax code overall, alleviating some of the bureaucratic burden of answering questions and executing audits associated with a special "married" status.
1.7. Con: Marriage licenses are here to stay. It's far more productive to advocate for equality within the existing system than to spend energy and time fighting this losing battle.
1.7.1. Con: There are incentives from both the left and the right of the political spectrum to end marriage licenses.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Social conservatives will no longer have to tolerate government endorsement of non traditional marriages.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Non traditional marriages will not have to face state discrimination.
1.7.2. Pro: Abolishing marriage license would be taking away a symbol of legitimacy for many married couples. This is a loss that would anger many people.
1.7.3. Pro: [Marriage equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage) has already been achieved [across the globe](http://uk.businessinsider.com/where-is-same-sex-marriage-legal-world-2017-11?r=US&IR=T/#7-in-2009-sweden-voted-overwhelmingly-in-favor-of-legalizing-same-sex-marriage-7) without any attacks on government involvement.
1.7.4. Pro: Many attacks on marriage equality come from those who fear that marriage equality will mean the end of traditional marriage. If attempts are made to abolish state recognition of marriage altogether, this fear will be realised and opposition to marriage equality may increase.
1.8. Con: The government has a legitimate interest in encouraging people to get married. Eliminating tax deductions for married couples deprives the government from acting on that interest.
1.8.1. Pro: The children of married couples achieve [more](https://ifstudies.org/blog/marriage-and-positive-child-outcomes-commitment-signaling-and-sequence) in educational, social and economic terms than the children of non-married couples. The government has an interest in promoting the well-being of children by incentivising marriage.
1.8.1.1. Con: The children of married couples tend to achieve more because of other factors than marriage.
1.8.1.1.1. Pro: Married couples tend to be [richer](https://www.today.com/money/why-married-people-tend-be-wealthier-its-complicated-1C8364877) in the first place allowing them to provide more opportunities to their children.
1.8.1.1.2. Pro: Married couples tend to be [more educated](https://www.today.com/money/why-married-people-tend-be-wealthier-its-complicated-1C8364877) allowing them to help their children in school.
1.8.1.1.3. Con: Married couples are likely to be in a more committed and stable relationship with one another because of marriage. This is because they have made a serious commitment to one another. This is helpful for the upbringing of a child.
1.8.1.1.3.1. Con: Stable couples will still exist with or without the label of marriage.
1.8.2. Pro: Many countries have [declining populations.](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2007/09/how_to_make_more_babies.html) This can be harmful for state welfare systems as populations age. Marriage incentives are one way states can encourage families.
1.8.2.1. Con: Tax benefits can be given to individuals with children as opposed to married couples in order to accomplish the same goal.
1.8.2.2. Con: Countries with declining population could let more immigrants in to help maintain the tax pool.
1.8.2.3. Con: As many as [60%](https://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/out-wedlock-births-rise-worldwide) of births in Latin America, for example, occur out of wedlock. It simply isn't true that marriage is necessary to encourage birthrates.
1.8.3. Pro: Married people tend [to be happier](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/upshot/study-finds-more-reasons-to-get-and-stay-married.html). The government has an interest in increasing happiness and relationship stability amongst its population.
1.8.3.1. Con: The [same study](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/upshot/study-finds-more-reasons-to-get-and-stay-married.html) shows that the same increase in happiness occurs whether or not individuals share a close friendship or are legally married.
1.8.3.2. Con: It is just as likely that happier people become married as opposed to marriage making people happier.
1.8.4. Con: A robber has an interest in encouraging people to give him/her their money. Taking his/her gun away deprives them of the ability to act on that interest.
1.8.5. Con: The mere fact that the government has an interest in something does not mean that they should be allowed to act on that interest indiscriminately.
