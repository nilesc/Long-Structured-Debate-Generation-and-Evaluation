Discussion Title: Does the brain actually store information, or is it stored elsewhere?

1. Does the brain actually store memories/information, or are they stored elsewhere - possibly in the broader context of consciousness?
1.1. Con: There are no hardwired physical connection between our brain and the external environment. Current research has not shown that there could be any way for our brains to have access to memories if they were stored elsewhere.
1.2. Pro: Memories are scars on our brains DNA. The brain breaks it's DNA to make a memory and our neurons immediately repair it afterward to prevent an accumulation of brain damage, a slow response from neurons or a failure to respond is what researchers think leads to alzheimer's and dementia.[sitn.hms.harvard.edu](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2013/thinking-dna-damage-into-existence/)
1.3. Pro: It is possible to 'remember' the experiences when outside the physical body, such as those experiences during NDEs and OBEs, when no physical brain is present.
1.3.1. Con: When experiencing NDEs or OBE, there is actually a brain still present in the physical body. Similarly as when dreaming, those experiences actually happen within our brains. We just do not feel anymore our body, and have instead other misperceptions produced by our unconscious, but we are not truly out of our body.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Drugs give the same effect. You might be feeling floating and in another dimension, but you still own a body and a brain.
1.4. Pro: There is a lack of research to conclusively state that memory/information is stored within the brain.
1.4.1. Con: There are lots of research in [neuroscience](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience#Neural_circuits_and_systems), including some about memory. This [article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/portrait-of-a-memory/) is an example of how successful and conclusive they can be.
1.4.2. Pro: Most people are not aware of the existence of such research. In order to create a critical mass of interest to spark more research, more people should learn about existing research through educational channels like documentaries.
1.4.2.1. Con: People would first have to learn about the basics of neurological anatomy and the chemical processes necessary for brain function. Most people are not interested in or able to investing time into such endeavors.
1.5. Pro: Search for the engram \(physical trace of a single memory\) has not been possible \([portrait of a memory](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/portrait-of-a-memory/)\).
1.5.1. Con: "This collection of work from multiple groups has built a strong case that the physiological trace of a memory—or at least key components of this trace—can be pinned down to specific neurons." \([Portrait of a memory](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/portrait-of-a-memory/)\)
1.5.2. Pro: New theories on consciousness are trying to explain the separation of the mind from the physical brain, whereby the brain simply exists within a field and picks up information from the surrounding field - presumably also storying information to this field \([A new theory of consciousness: the mind exists as a field connected to the brain](https://www.theepochtimes.com/uplift/a-new-theory-of-consciousness-the-mind-exists-as-a-field-connected-to-the-brain_2325840.html)\).
1.6. Con: "In particular, we argue that all “contents of consciousness” are generated by and within non-conscious brain systems in the form of a continuous self-referential personal narrative ..." \([The Non-conscious Nature of Being](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01924/full)\)
1.7. Pro: We do not need our physical brain to exist beyond physical reality \([Portal into Consciousness - chapter 4](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=gzlLDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=portal+into+consciousness&source=bl&ots=ipAx-hNBlg&sig=CesdM6XY-sP2ogf4T3ithieXHJs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx69WcnPrZAhUCTbwKHeq8BesQ6AEISjAG#v=snippet&q=chapter%204%20concepts%20of%20a%20journey&f=false)\).
1.7.1. Con: When we feel and perceive being disconnected from the physical reality, the physical brain can still be the host of these perception, as revealed for example by [electroencephalograms showing a surge of brain activity during near death experiments](https://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Mays/publication/276276366_Near-Death_Experiences_and_EEG_Surges_at_End_of_Life/links/5554cada08ae980ca60ad219/Near-Death-Experiences-and-EEG-Surges-at-End-of-Life.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwixwt_anv3ZAhVBsKQKHXttCdoQFjACegQICBAB&usg=AOvVaw0rQ2diQmPkQ1mKlBVk0s9k).
1.7.2. Con: There are no scientific evidence that we could actually exist anywhere without a physical brain.
1.7.3. Pro: When dreaming, we live in worlds beyond from our physical environment and body.
1.8. Con: "Recollection, according to current theories, occurs when these neurons fire again and replay the activity patterns associated with past experience" \([Portrait of a Memory](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/portrait-of-a-memory/)\).
1.9. Pro: The research claims that activity patterns or signatures are the actual storage of memory, but there is no conclusive evidence that a signature reflects a memory or piece of information.
1.9.1. Con: Electroencephalogram measures of synchronized neural activity can precisely [track the contents of memory](http://www.futurity.org/eeg-can-see-youre-holding-minds-eye/).
1.10. Pro: Those that have had DMT journeys, have become aware of 'things' through experiencing them, without the actual physical experience. It has been talked about as if the experience has been downloaded to them, when disconnected from the physical body. But they now retain a 'memory' of the experience later when assimilated back into the physical body.
1.10.1. Con: Drugs hallucinations are comparable to dreams in the fact that we experience events that are not physically happening in our body environment, and then have memories of it after awakening. Stephen Laberge explains that dreams are built from already existing mind schemas, expectations and motivations. See [Exploring the world of lucid dreaming](https://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://mogami.neocities.org/files/lucid_dreaming.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjXttvhgf3ZAhULsaQKHbE2DGUQFjAAegQIBhAB&usg=AOvVaw3N_Y4zVZnU8Ly2EZ5hbJ6R),  chapter 5 \(from page 77\).
1.10.2. Pro: Until we can scientifically prove otherwise it is possible that certain drugs or mental states may activate sensory potential that goes beyond what the conscious mind can process.
