Discussion Title: Should A Character Witness Be Required To Purchase Guns or Ammo?

1. A character witness should be required to purchase guns or ammo
1.1. Pro: Responsible gun owners would still be able to purchase a gun without a challenge.
1.1.1. Pro: For legitimate gun purchasers this would have little impact, but if someone wanted to buy a gun to kill themselves, they would have to explain to at least one person they know that they want to get a gun.
1.1.1.1. Con: They can easily lie about the reason for wanting to purchase a gun.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: People with bad intent can easily bypass this constraint.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This is not meant as a complete solution to the problem, just a small adjustment to the current system.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Even preventing some people with bad intent from acquiring a gun is valuable to society.
1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: If someone is determined enough, they will find a way to manipulate the requirements in their favor.
1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: The existence of crime does not absolve society from attempting to prevent it.
1.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: Someone with the appropriate skill can make a gun and ammunition. With the advent of home 3-D printing and home milling machines, it is easier than ever.
1.1.2. Pro: This is a small change to existing laws that might have an impact on mass shootings, but would not affect the rights of legitimate gun purchasers significantly.
1.2. Pro: A character witness can validate the purchaser is of sound mind.
1.2.1. Con: Everyone is not a good judge of character. The amount of human error here makes this an unreliable method.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Many close relatives and family members of mass shooters have stated [they had no idea](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/las-vegas-stephen-paddock-marilou-danley-mass-shootings-killers-murderers-families-victims-too-a7986181.html) the individual was capable of such actions.
1.2.2. Con: Character witness is an opinion of a person and not based in fact.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The character witness would most-likely not be a qualified mental-health professional that can accurately make this decision.
1.3. Con: There is no legal way of ensuring a character witness would provide an accurate statement about the purchaser.
1.3.1. Pro: The purchaser could convince a friend or even pay a stranger to give a false statement.
1.3.2. Con: Character witnesses can be corroborated with local police records of 911 calls, an interview with the local police, and police assessment following interview \(as now required by law in Massachusetts as of 5/7/18\)[m.huffpost.com](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5aeb27a9e4b041fd2d23d3f7/amp#click=https://t.co/LOJSoMGwvv)
1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.4. Con: To require a character witness or witness statement for every purchase of ammunition is unfairly onerous for people who regularly use firearms for hunting, pest control, and target training.
1.4.1. Con: Those who regularly use firearms are not exempt from using it for improper reasons. Therefore, no one should be exempt, no matter how onerous it seems.
1.4.2. Con: Those who regularly use firearms will likely want to protect their right to continue, and will see no issue in providing a character witness for safety precautions.
1.5. Pro: Government lists of who should or shouldn't be able to purchase a gun have errors and omissions.
1.5.1. Pro: Any large system has errors in it.  Including a redundant check often reduces the impact of obvious failures.
1.5.2. Pro: Some people that are not on any government list, should still have a hard time obtaining a gun.
1.5.3. Con: This can be corrected without the requirement of another person being present.
1.5.3.1. Con: A system as complex as the US governement, 50 state governments, thousands of county governments, thousands of city governments is impossible to have records that are 100% up to date and 100% accurate.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: Nothing is 100% error proof, including a character witness. However, effort to reduce errors is worth pursuing.
1.6. Con: The character witness might be liable if the purchaser commits a crime with the weapons or ammo.
1.6.1. Pro: The character witness has to vouch in a documented sell, then the character witness' reputation and word is on the line. The witness being with the purchaser is basically saying "I vouch for this person." If the purchaser goes out and commits a crime, the witness may be held liable for damages.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.8. Pro: It would be harder to keep it a secret that you have a gun.
1.8.1. Pro: It would be harder to create an arsenal in secret as a lone wolf.
1.8.2. Con: Guns owned by others are sometimes used for crimes, so keeping them secret might not be a bad thing.
1.8.3. Con: If gun ownership became public record, houses with guns may be targeted for theft while the owner is away as guns have significant black-market value.
1.9. Con: Having a character witness does not guarantee a person can be trusted with a firearm.
1.9.1. Pro: The purchaser may not have exhibited questionable behavior prior to wanting a gun.
1.9.2. Con: Since it is a small change to the existing gun restrictions, if it was found to be ineffectual it could be repealed just as easily as it is implemented.
