Discussion Title: Should private prisons be banned?

1. Should private prisons be banned?
1.1. Pro: Private prisons being payed daily/monthly per prisoner incentives prisons to keep prisoners in jail for as long as possible
1.2. Pro: The prison system can be viewed as a ["natural monopoly"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly) like roads or the electricity grid.
1.3. Con: The public prison system costs taxpayers, and therefore it is in the best interest of the government to make prisons privatized.
1.3.1. Pro: Private prisons may be more cost-effective for the government thus saving money in taxes.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Research suggests that "private companies can cut costs by negotiating item costs and purchasing in bulk, by eliminating overtime and employee benefits, and by reducing the red tape" in buying equipment or hiring or firing staff \([Perrone, p. 302](http://www.d.umn.edu/~jmaahs/Correctional%20Continuum/Online%20Readings/PerroneandPratt_privatization.pdf)\).
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Scholars also suggest that the government could implement the same [measures](http://www.d.umn.edu/~jmaahs/Correctional%20Continuum/Online%20Readings/PerroneandPratt_privatization.pdf).
1.3.1.1.2. Con: [Researchers](http://www.d.umn.edu/~jmaahs/Correctional%20Continuum/Online%20Readings/PerroneandPratt_privatization.pdf), however, point out that privatization's cost savings may be short term only, and that long-term costs are may exceed those of public prisons due to "the need to keep a stable or growing inmate population to ensure profits".
1.4. Pro: Justice should be doled out by government, not by private citizens. Privatization removes an aspect of government authority from the justice process.
1.5. Con: The competition of the privatized prison systems leads to a fairer system. The prisons that preform better are rewarded with profits.
1.5.1. Con: Since prisons deal with people and with an integral part of law enforcement, determining what success means, unrelated to profit, may be difficult.
1.5.2. Con: Measures that lead to a greater profit typically contradict what is "fair", and lead to much poorer conditions, including cutting programs that help to rehabilitate prisoners which they deem "unnecessary"
1.6. Pro: The privatization of prisons means justice is an industry, meaning the goal is for costs to kept low while profits are kept high, meaning prisoners receive substandard treatment.
1.6.1. Pro: Private prisons tend [to be more violent](https://www.vox.com/2016/8/12/12454410/private-prisons-violence-investigation) due to low staffing, thus leading to a more dangerous environment for prisoners and proving this is only a for-profit industry.
1.7. Pro: Turning the prison system into a profitable system has made it too susceptible to corruption.
1.7.1. Con: Public systems can be equally corruptible.
1.8. Pro: Making the prison system privatized removes power from the people to legislate how we want our prisons to be run, and instead hands that responsibility to private companies.
1.8.1. Con: The state still has the power to legislate prison standards and procedure.
1.8.1.1. Con: Even if the state can legislate procedures and standards, if the state does no run prisons, it does lose the capacity to monitor and control them closely.
1.9. Con: Not only is there a reduction of taxes, it also creates jobs for small communities, which generates revenue.
1.9.1. Con: Those jobs would still be created if the state was running the prison itself.
1.10. Con: Having more prisons in operation helps reduce overpopulation in prisons, and helps to stem overflow.
1.10.1. Con: Having more prisons is equally possible by increasing the number of non-private prisons.
1.10.2. Pro: Due to prison overcrowding, private prisons are necessary so the government can speed up the process of creating new prisons.
1.10.2.1. Pro: While the US federal government, for example, takes "at least two years to build a prison, private prison corporations claim they can build a prison in less than 18 months" [\(Antonuccio, p. 580\)](http://lesliecaton.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/A5-Antonuccio.pdf).
