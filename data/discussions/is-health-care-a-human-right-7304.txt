Discussion Title: Is health care a human right?

1. Health care should be considered a human right.
1.1. Pro: It is the duty of the state to protect its citizens. One key way they can do this is by providing health care to all.
1.1.1. Pro: Denying the right to health care disproportionately discriminates against aged, sick, disabled, and poor citizens.
1.1.1.1. Pro: These groups are less likely to be able to work and more likely to require health care. It is unreasonable to say that because they cannot afford it the state should not look after them.
1.1.2. Con: Vulnerable citizens can be given support with healthcare without making it a human right.
1.1.2.1. Con: We need human rights for protection when our legal rights are violated by the state, and to encourage justice and fairness within our societies. Making healthcare a human right would mean that citizens have the ability to challenge their state, if that state fails to fulfil their rights.
1.1.3. Pro: In 1948, the UN adopted the Universal Human Rights Declaration. [Article 25](http://www.un.org/en/udhrbook/pdf/udhr_booklet_en_web.pdf) \(p. 52\) states: "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services."
1.1.3.1. Con: Medical care suggests something different from health care. Getting treatment for a life-threatening affliction is not the same as getting annual check-ups. This quote is not specific enough to support the claim that health care is a right.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Healthcare is complicated and made up of several subparts. For example, accessibility to nutritional advice could be considered part of healthcare.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: Healthcare is sometimes [defined as](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=define%3A+healthcare) "the organized provision of medical care to individuals or a community". This suggests there is little difference between the terms, as healthcare just refers to the provision of medical care.
1.1.4. Con: Duties of the state should be limited to those things that are necessary roles of government. It is not necessary for the state to provide healthcare. People can get that for themselves.
1.1.5. Con: It is also the duty of the state to protect all its citizens. Making an open-ended commitment to providing health care for all might sound good today, but it might be a crushing burden on future citizens who have to pay for the health care of an aging population.
1.1.5.1. Con: The World Health organisation \(WHO\) has released a [report](http://www.who.int/whr/2010/en/) which maps the ways that all countries can sustainably achieve universal healthcare.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: The 49 "low-income countries" that would find it hardest to adopt universal healthcare have been [given a roadmap](http://www.who.int/whr/2010/10_summary_en.pdf?ua=1) which includes Increasing the efficiency of revenue collection, reprioritising government budgets, innovating financing, and receiving development assistance for health supported by the Millennium Development Goals.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: This report estimates that from [20% to 40% of all health spending is currently wasted through inefficiency](http://www.who.int/whr/2010/10_summary_en.pdf?ua=1), and urges these savings to be pursued instead of cutting funding or leaving some citizens with no care at all.
1.1.6. Pro: Being alive is dear to every human being. Hence, there is huge opportunity for exploiting the sick, both poor and rich, by private players. Medical expenses form a major component of the expenditure by poor households in many societies. Hence it is the duty of a Govt or Ruler to ensure the right of life and right against exploitation of its loyal and taxpaying citizens.
1.1.7. Pro: Health of individuals living in a society benefits the greater good of community health. For example vaccination can lead to less disease in the population and thus more funds for other goals and prosperity.
1.1.8. Pro: Healthcare is necessary to ensure human survival. It is also kind to help out another fellow human being who is in need of treatment. Therefore, denying health services to a human being is almost the same as harming or killing them.
1.1.9. Con: Providing healthcare to 'vulnerable citizens' is not the same as healthcare to all. [MEDICAID](https://www.medicaid.gov/index.html) is the US program that provides healthcare to the most vulnerable US citizens. [SCHIP](https://www.medicaid.gov/CHIP/index.html) is another program that extends medical coverage to vulnerable youth in the US not covered by regular medicaid. In this way resources are very targeted.
1.1.10. Pro: It is the nature of disease that you are at a disadvantage in resources. It's not right to require the sick to pay for the sick. It's an unfair expectation. It's like asking the poor to solve poverty or the hungry to solve hunger.
1.1.10.1. Con: This assumes that the sick \(or the poor, in your analogy\) are not at fault for their condition. That is not always the case.
1.2. Con: Direct providing or financing of healthcare by the state will facilitate corruption and artificially increase health insurance costs.
1.2.1. Con: Many countries [have public healthcare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_universal_health_care) without corruption, and there is no correlation between[countries with high corruption](https://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/overview) and healthcare.
1.2.2. Con: Directly financing healthcare means health insurance becomes an optional extra for the rich wanting better private care. Therefore increased health insurance costs is not as important as protection of the general populations health.
1.2.3. Pro: A free market providing an universal basic income would work better for guaranteeing poor people's health as it wouldn't face these problems.
1.2.3.1. Con: UBI + markets opens up the real possibilities that people choose to not get health care or get priced out of it. If we're unwilling to let those people live without treatment, a universal care system removes the perverse incentive to avoid getting care early to save money.
1.2.3.2. Con: A UBI would not cover the costs of medical care, as the UBI payout would likely be set just above the cost of living. This would not be anywhere near enough to cover expensive medical procedures.
1.2.4. Con: There is evidence to suggest that a [single-payer system](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/upshot/why-single-payer-health-care-saves-money.html?_r=0) allows for negotiations that would actually [drive down](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/03/26/21-graphs-that-show-americas-health-care-prices-are-ludicrous/?utm_term=.6ffd89100d6a) the price of services.
1.3. Pro: Health care is necessary for people to live good and fulfilling lives.
1.3.1. Pro: We have the inalienable right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. Health care is necessary in order to access these other rights.
1.3.1.1. Con: Health care is not necessary to access these rights. One does not need to consult with a doctor before embarking on their dreams or exercising their freedoms.
1.3.1.2. Con: One's rights extend only as far as they do not impact other people. The government spending too much money on health care may negatively affect one's liberty either through high taxation or failing to adequately provide other government services.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: Human rights are inherent and cannot be revoked because they merely "impact other people".
1.3.1.3. Con: You are not entitled to the means required to achieve those things.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: People who steal to pay for health care are not excused from their criminal actions.
1.3.1.3.2. Con: You can be entitled to something without being entitled to take any means necessary to get that thing. Having a right doesn't mean you can do anything you like, and break any law, to exercise that right.
1.3.1.4. Con: Life is a right really. It makes sense when you say that nobody can take your life. But you are responsible to take care of it. Nobody is obligated to take care of your life for you. That's what happen when you have a public health care system: all the population have to pay for someone mistake of a single individual through taxes.
1.3.1.5. Pro: Once your survival depends on 24/7 life support, it is a question of whether you are allowed to live.
1.3.1.6. Con: This claim is a perversion of that phrase. Jefferson meant that nobody should be able to hinder your pursuit of happiness. One's health problems are not caused by someone else, but rather biology and life itself.
1.3.1.7. Pro: As expressed by Mr. T. Jefferson. "all men .  .  .  are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." This nation was founded on the principle that life is a right. Health is required for life, therefore health is a right.
1.3.1.7.1. Pro: Medical conditions can interfere with a person’s ability to access all other human rights. If the poor are denied healthcare for lack of money, they are being denied other human rights for lack of money. That goes against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
1.3.1.7.2. Con: "Health care" is not "health".
1.3.1.7.2.1. Con: But healthcare is the means to ensure good health, therefore showing a right to health shows a right for the healthcare that enables good health.
1.3.1.7.3. Con: Coercive taxes to maintain a health care system inhibit the right to freedom.
1.3.1.7.3.1. Con: The same can be said for taxes for military spending, education, or public office. No modern society has the right to freedom from taxes.
1.3.2. Pro: Without basic bodily health, being a full, self-determined individual participant in society, regardless of the condition of those facts over which you have no control \(race, circumstances of birth, etc.\) is impossible.
1.3.3. Pro: Bad health leads to suffering. Suffering is something we should avoid. It is ethically wrong to deny poor people health care, and only give it to those privileged few who can pay. Because that means the absence of suffering is a matter of money instead of morals.
1.3.3.1. Con: Money is not as consequential to the absence of suffering as medical and technological advancements are. Rich people of the past had less access to effective care than poor people today do.
1.3.3.2. Con: Resources are limited. It is impossible to provide a standard of care for everyone that is equivalent to what wealthy people can afford.
1.3.4. Con: Not everything that gives people more fulfilling lives is necessarily a right.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Sex is necessary for people to live good and fulfilling lives in many cases \(and for the survival of the human race\) - but no one is considering sex to be a human right.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: [Reproductive Rights](https://family.findlaw.com/reproductive-rights/what-are-reproductive-rights-.html) often exist.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: The US Supreme Court has recognized reproductive rights as personal rights that are deemed "fundamental" and which extend to procreation \([Skinner v. Oklahoma](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/316/535.html)\), contraception \([Eisenstadt v. Baird](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/405/438.html)\), family relationships \([Prince v. Massachusetts](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/321/158.html)\) and child rearing \([Pierce v. Society of Sisters](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/268/510.html)\).
1.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: The UN's [OHCHR includes reproductive rights](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/NHRIHandbook.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwip68yurePcAhWHCsAKHcUOD14QFjACegQIBxAB&usg=AOvVaw2qzdsnJlfDGIsQ4WGFm9HT&cshid=1533933999149) as human rights.
1.3.4.2. Con: Most things that make a fulfilling life are not necessities, however things that facilitate survival are essential for a fulfilled life at all.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Many people would not even have a life without healthcare.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: Sex and offspring both facilitate survival and fulfilling lives. You must insist that they are both rights if you want to claim health care is a right using this argument.
1.3.4.2.2.1. Con: Whilst sex and offspring are necessary for the survival of the human species, it is not necessary for individual survival.
1.3.5. Con: Health care is not necessary for a "good and fulfilling" life, but it can be helpful at times, necessary in some cases, and not of any use in other instances. Health care may be necessary for a long life, but not in all cases. Some applications of health care may undermine one's ability to lead a fulfilling life in exchange for a longer life.
1.3.6. Pro: Human suffering should be eliminated, and the way to do that is healthcare. Healthcare is a basic human right, in order to be productive, the standard line is to have a healthy body to work at it.
1.4. Con: Health care should remain a privilege, not a right.
1.4.1. Con: It is not clear that health care should only be a privilege for those who can afford it. Many circumstances out of the control of individuals could lead to situations where they have financial difficulties, and the state should therefore provide health care to all.
1.4.2. Con: Health should never be seen as a commodity. Deciding whether one can live or not, purely on his income is a crime against humanity.
1.4.2.1. Con: What if a doctor refused to treat an individual based on their moral quality. Still a "crime against humanity?" It seems that health care is not so much the right people insist exists as it is the right to have government guarantee that health care is paid for, which isn't quite the same thing.
1.4.3. Pro: Many things are good and desirable that are labeled as rights. But an inherent right is something we are born with. It is something that if there were no laws or society to enforce them, we would have the moral right to assert for ourselves without infringing on the rights of others. Healthcare is a good thing, but it is not a right. It is something to be sought and something we should seek to provide within reason, but it is not on the same level as, for example, the right to free speech.
1.4.3.1. Con: There are many different types of human right. While healthcare is not an inherent right \(also called a negative right\), it would still be an "Economic, Social, and Cultural" right \(also called a positive right\).
1.4.3.1.1. Con: [Economic, social and cultural rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic,_social_and_cultural_rights) are not always considered full human rights. The term 'right' is the subject of [continued philosophical debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights#cite_note-9). While there is consensus that human rights encompasses a [wide variety of rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights#cite_note-twsBritannica-5) such as the right to a fair trial, free speech, or a right to education, there is [disagreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights#cite_note-twsStanfordEncyclopedia-1) about which of these particular rights should be included within the general framework of human rights.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: The most international definition of a human right is that of the UN, which includes Education in it's 1948 [Universal declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: The idea of separating cultural/social/economic rights from civil/political rights [was only temporary](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/ESCR/Pages/AreESCRfundamentallydifferentfromcivilandpoliticalrights.aspx), as a reaction to east/west differences during the cold war. The Universal Deceleration of Human Rights no longer makes any distinction between the types of rights.
1.4.3.1.3. Pro: The [UN argues that](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/ESCR/Pages/AreESCRfundamentallydifferentfromcivilandpoliticalrights.aspx) the enjoyment of all human rights is interlinked so categories of rights such as “civil and political rights” or “economic, social and cultural rights” make little sense.
1.4.3.1.4. Pro: Karel Vasaks [Three generations of human rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_generations_of_human_rights) includes these rights as human rights \(second and third generations\).
1.4.3.2. Con: Newborn's rights are dependent upon where on the planet they're born. No one, for example, has the right to food, shelter or healthcare, the society of the culture into which you're born dictates your rights according to the laws of that culture. We decide what rights are and who gets them. No one is born with inherent rights.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: While your place of birth \(and actions of others\) affects the extent that your rights are upheld, everyone [still has natural human rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights) which are inalienable.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: There is no such thing as a natural right. The very theory of natural rights is self-evidently the philosophical work of humans.
1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Many things are the philosophical work of humans, like 'justice', 'love', 'fairness', and they are still accepted and part of our reasoning of the world. If these are accepted as concepts that we use to make decision, then so should the concept of 'rights'.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2. Con: Natural rights 'exist' because they are part of human [language](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/natural--rights), defined and used [in our legal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights), [studied by science](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=natural+rights), and are also a part of history, [appearing in ancient greek philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights#cite_note-1) and "developed in the Middle Ages [by Catholic philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights) such as Albert the Great".
1.4.4. Pro: Every country is at different levels of advancement, especially in relation to health care. Everyone within one society may well be due the same level of health care but it is not the duty of one society to expect another to uphold its level of healthcare. This is the case with housing in first world countries vs third world countries, as well as many other areas such as food hygiene, wifi access, policing etc. It is a privilege to those countries that have it, and may be for others one day too.
1.4.5. Con: That's a matter of perspective. The United States is the only western country that does not have universal health care. In most European countries the state sees health care as a human right, not a business.
1.4.6. Pro: If you can't afford health care, a doctor, treatment, or medicine, you have no right to it.
1.4.6.1. Con: Many other existing human rights also require money, trained paid professionals, infrastructure, a stable state etc.
1.4.6.1.1. Pro: The [right to a fair trial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial) is a similar human right that is functioning. It is similar in that it needs trained paid professionals, extensive infrastructure, and public funding.
1.4.6.1.1.1. Pro: This is defined by [the Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights), the [Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), and Article 6 of the [European Convention of Human Rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights).
1.4.6.1.2. Pro: The [right to education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_education) is a similar human right which is accepted and functioning. It is similar in that it requires a functioning economy, trained paid professionals, and has a private alternative.
1.4.6.1.2.1. Con: The right to education is a limited right. It generally applies at a certain age and up to a certain level of education. It is not as simple to limit the right to health care.
1.4.6.1.2.1.1. Con: There is no need/reason to limit healthcare for non-elective medical issues.
1.4.6.1.2.1.2. Con: Elective medical issues, for example anything cosmetic, are already limited in most western public healthcare systems.
1.4.6.1.2.1.3. Con: All human rights are limited in some ways. The right to life is limited when the only way to continue your life is to kill someone else. The right to freedom of speech \(opinion and expression\) is limited in many countries if inciting hate crimes, or revealing secrets you legally agreed to keep \(Official Secrets Act, Non-disclosure agreements\).
1.4.6.1.2.2. Pro: The UN [Right To Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights) has been agreed by 166 states, and has been in effect since 1976.
1.4.6.1.2.2.1. Con: "Most \[signatories\] do not in practice give equal weight to the different types of rights. Some Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights, sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the right to work, to education, health and housing. Similarly the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic, social and cultural rights, but have often failed to provide civil and political rights."
1.4.6.1.2.3. Con: Healthcare costs more than Education.
1.4.6.1.2.3.1. Pro: In the UK, Healthcare [costs](https://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/uk_total_spending_pie_chart) £149.7 billion \(19%\), but Education only costs £85.3 billion \(11%\).
\([USA](https://www.usgovernmentspending.com/united_states_total_spending_pie_chart):  22% / 15%\).
1.4.6.1.2.3.2. Con: Cost should not decide what is a right, but only cause a limit to the extent a right can be upheld.
1.4.6.1.3. Pro: The [right to food](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_food), [right to housing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_housing), and other [rights to standard of life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_an_adequate_standard_of_living) are [internationally defined and accepted](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights), but require labor, money, and effort.
1.4.6.1.3.1. Con: The link to 'right to food' in the above claim explicitly states that "The right to food does not imply that governments have an obligation to hand out free food to everyone who wants it, or a right to be fed." This is not a human right in the same way that health care is suggested to become a human right.
1.4.6.1.3.1.1. Con: The right to food is defined by access to "adequate food", as well as being "free from hunger". Healthcare as a human right could be defined in a similar fashion eg "adequate heath care" and being "free from avoidable deaths" \(or "free from reasonably treatable illness" etc..\)
1.4.6.1.3.1.2. Con: The [ICESCR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_food#CITEREFCommittee_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights1999) says "the right to adequate food is realised when every man, woman and child, alone or in community with others, have the physical and economic access at all times to adequate food or means for its procurement." This definition could directly replace "food" with "health care" and work well.
1.4.6.1.4. Con: These rights are different, they are [positive not negative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights), and are [economic, social, and cultural.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic,_social_and_cultural_rights) They are not top level human rights.
1.4.6.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.
1.4.6.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.
1.4.6.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.4.
1.4.6.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.2.
1.4.6.2. Con: If people don't have a good health, they can't work, thus they can't pay for good health care either. That puts them at an unfair disadvantage.
1.4.7. Pro: Health care is a privilege in countries that can afford to give it. If a country has it then the right to the health care goes to the person as a citizen, not as a human, because humans that are not a citizen in that country won't have the right to get access to it.
1.4.8. Con: Regardless of your political ideology, we have advanced our technology to the point where there is no excuse for depriving it. Only our flawed ethics, moral values and fraudulent monetary economy prevent it.
1.4.8.1. Con: The advanced technology has only served to increase the cost, not lessen it. This argument would only make sense if healthcare costs were being constantly reduced.
1.4.8.1.1. Pro: The cost of heath care per capita has been [steadily increasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita).
1.4.9. Pro: The term "human right" is problematic and a purely intellectual construct not echoed in nature.
1.4.9.1. Con: The meaning of "human right" is [well defined](https://www.kialo.com/is-health-care-a-human-right-7304/7304.0=7304.1-7304.47-7304.121-7304.130+7304.96+7304.98) internationally.
1.4.9.2. Con: Human rights are the things that we, as humans, are entitled to. Such things are echoed in nature as seen in the case of animals living in prides or groups. All animals are responsible for not only their own welfare, but they must also ensure that the other members of the group are well fed, protected, etc. Thus, rights are not merely a "purely intellectual construct" but rather a means of survival which is frequently echoed in nature.
1.4.9.3. Con: Examples such as Justice, Equality, and Freedom of speech are beneficial for humanity but are not echoed in nature.
1.5. Pro: Many people suffer poor health and injuries through no fault of their own. They should always be able to receive the necessary health care and treatment.
1.5.1. Pro: Disease is a weakness that we all share. Therefore we should pool our resources and band together.
1.5.1.1. Con: Human psychology is full of weaknesses that lead to behaviors contrary to our health and well-being. Taking collective action to address the behavioral shortcomings of individuals is problematic, but probably necessary if we accept that premise that instances of weakness demand societal intervention.
1.5.2. Con: Morality doesnt play a role in health outcomes. Everyone that is seen at the ER is treated, regardless of their ability to pay immediately. It is up to that individual to pay their debt afterward.
1.5.2.1. Con: This will lead to further marginalisation of lower-income groups who will simply be unable to pay for their healthcare. If they require multiple treatments, then they may never be able to pay.
1.5.3. Con: Heathcare does not need to be provided by the government for it to be freely available. The markets — businesses — can do that.
1.5.3.1. Con: Companies have no motivation to provide *free* healthcare, by definition companies aim for profit. They can very well provide it, but if it is a right we need the state to *guarantee* the terms under which it is provided.
1.5.3.2. Con: When healthcare is provided by the private sector, it can still be a human right, it would just be enforced by government regulations.
1.5.3.3. Con: But they don't. And they never will, because they can't profit off of that.
1.5.4. Con: Suffering poor health and injuries is a consequence of living. These things are not caused by anyone else, and therefore nobody else should be obligated to service/fix those things.
1.5.4.1. Con: There are many cases where poor health and injuries can be caused by others, and are not a consequence of just living. Examples could include car crashes where the injured person was not to blame, or an employers poor health and safety causing an employee to suffer an injury/illness.
1.5.5. Con: The above claim is false because 'should' implies 'can'. Unfortunately however, the necessary health care and treatment is not always available.
1.5.6. Con: We may all agree in this premise, but it does not mean it is a right. Rights should be reserved for natural rights.
1.6. Pro: Health care being guaranteed as a human right has societal benefits.
1.6.1. Pro: Free treatment facilities for people with substance abuse problems has been linked to lower instances of violent and [financially motivated crimes](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/01/03/new-evidence-that-access-to-health-care-reduces-crime/); denying free health care to the most vulnerable individuals have societal repercussions.
1.6.2. Pro: Universal healthcare can reduce the spread of communicable diseases.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Just as letting your neighbors' houses burn will eventually cost you your own, allowing viruses and bacteria to spread among the poor unchecked gives those diseases a haven to improve their capabilities
1.6.2.2. Con: Many things can reduce the spread of communicable diseases, including curtailing freedoms.
1.6.3. Pro: Free medical assistance has been essential in tackling outbreaks, such as [Ebola](https://www.actionaid.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/emergencies-disasters-humanitarian-response/ebola-virus-outbreak-in-west-africa-2014-2016).
1.6.4. Con: Depends on the definition of health care. If health care merely means emergency life-sustaining treatment, this has a chance of becoming policy. If health care means anything that improves well-being, the policy would be too broad to employ in policy.
1.6.4.1. Con: [Many countries](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/18/upshot/best-health-care-system-country-bracket.html) already do provide healthcare that improves wellbeing rather than just emergency treatment.
1.6.5. Con: If treated as a civil right, people won't take responsibility for unhealthy behaviors.
1.6.5.1. Con: Even if people pay for it themselves, it does not guarantee the absence of unhealthy behaviors. People that pay are just as likely to have unhealthy behaviors as those who do not pay.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: The objective "to guarantee the absence of unhealthy behaviors" is completely unrealistic. That has never been achieved or even stated as an aim of health care.
1.6.5.2. Pro: Incentives matter. When people face no responsibility for the outcome of their actions their behaviour will reflect this.
1.6.5.2.1. Con: There is a built-in consequence to unhealthy actions - being unhealthy.
1.6.5.3. Pro: Free health care could lead to citizens not caring for their heath because getting ill or injured has little to no financial downside. This leads to a unnecessary strain on whomever pays for the care ie. the government. It would lead to society being worse because of lack of people caring about their heath. If a person can become extremely obese and not pay for the problems created, it would damage society instead of helping it.
1.6.5.4. Con: Even if healthcare were free, people still wouldn't want to spend all their free time at hospitals, and they wouldn't risk injuring themselves \(any more than they already do\) for fear that they'd die before they received treatment. Besides - people already indulge in unhealthy behaviours in spite of the fact that they'll have to pay for their own healthcare.
1.6.5.5. Con: There is no evidence to suggest this claim, but [evidence to support the opposite](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/2011/07/does_health_coverage_make_people_healthier.html).
1.6.6. Pro: Not providing health care to young people increases costs in the long run. If you treat a wound before it infects you can have this person being a constructive member of society again, if you wait until after it infects he might lose his leg and has to live off the State for the rest of his life.
1.6.7. Con: Not all things that benefit society are or should be a right. Health care is one of them.
1.7. Con: A right is what is owed/allowed to people by its society. Nothing can be a right in general \(a.k.a. human rights\), but only in a particular "ethos" \(context/custom\) and "polis" \(society\).
1.7.1. Pro: Human rights don't exist, but only particular and providable rights in each society - i.e., in a society where healthcare is providable, it will be a right; in a society where a house is providable, it will be a right; the right to life is not applicable at war, or when you are threatened with death, etc.
1.7.2. Pro: Unlike other rights, health care has no simple, universal standard to define it. What's "adequate" to one person in one culture or era may be inadequate in another context, and as such devolves into political demagoguery.
1.7.3. Con: The word right could be used many ways, but we should use it in the [internationally accepted manner](http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/human-rights/) \(agreed by almost every country\), which is commonly understood as "[inalienable, inherent in all human beings, applicable everywhere, and being the same for everyone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights)".
1.7.3.1. Con: The parent claim is challenging the concept of "Human Right" from the definition of "Right". However, the sources you are providing refer to a "Human Right as a Right..."; they are not against the definition of "Right" given at the parent claim. Moreover, according to one of your sources, [rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights)
1.7.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.2.
1.7.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.
1.7.4. Con: A right can only be a natural right, best described as self-evident in the U.S. [Declaration of Independence](http://www.ushistory.org/Declaration/document/): "They are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable right."
1.7.4.1. Pro: The U.S. Constitution does not provide for ["Positive Rights"](http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2009/11/16/health-care-and-the-fallacy-of-positive-rights/) such as the right to health care.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: The linked article is a liberal right opinion that states these rights should not be granted because it limits economical freedom. It misses the point that human life is more important than private property.
1.7.4.1.1.1. Con: Private property is an expression of life. To deny a right to labors of one's life is no better than denying a right to one's life or liberty.
1.7.4.1.2. Pro: Supreme court rulings support this view, that [the Constitution is a charter of negative rather than positive liberties](https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/conlaw/articles/volume3/issue2/MacNaughton3U.Pa.J.Const.L.750\(2001\).pdf).
1.7.4.1.3. Con: This implies that human rights are only actual when they are formal legal rights. This totally undermines any principles of universality considering the totally contingent historical and political nature of legal norms \(such as the inclusion of the right to the pursuit of happiness in your constitution in place of the right to estate propounded in Locke - in order to perpetuate slavery within the boundaries of the document\). No legitimate rights theorist would take this seriously.
1.7.4.1.3.1. Con: If a right isn't codified as formal legal right, there is no point to the 'right' beyond having a fun internet debate about it.
1.7.4.1.3.1.1. Con: There are hugely important [International Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law) which have had huge effect on the development of society. These are not codified, are consent-based, and do not have methods of enforcement, but are a huge part of international relations between countries.
1.7.4.1.4. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.
1.7.4.1.5. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.4.
1.8. Con: There is a difference between declaring something a human right and forcing everyone else to provide it to them.
1.8.1. Pro: You don't have a right to others labor.
1.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.1.
1.8.1.2. Pro: No individual may compel another individual to provide a service to them \(this is called "slavery"\). Health care is a service. Since no individual has authority to enslave others, no individual may delegate that authority to others.
1.8.1.3. Pro: We have a right to a lawyer \(a trained professional like doctors\), but only for the[right to counsel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_counsel) if the State charges you in criminal court but not in civil courts. Our demands on them are constrained by clientele and circumstances. But if we do this for doctors \(which we need throughout life\) then we create an unconstrained set of demands on a doctor’s labor, and that risks violating their rights as a free-agent worker permanently.
1.8.1.3.1. Con: There is no need for unconstrained demands on doctors, the same way there is no need for unconstrained demands on lawyers. Requesting a nose job from a doctor should not be covered by a human right, but requesting removal of a tumor should be covered. This is similar to how getting a lawyer to sell your house is not covered by your human rights, but instructing a lawyer to defend you on murder charges is covered.
1.8.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.1.
1.8.1.5. Con: A civilized society \(such as ours\) should teach the healthy to care for the sick, the educated to educate those who want to learn, the wealthy to enable others to prosper. These responsibilities \(?obligations?\) of privilege have disappeared. It's unfortunate that this becomes an argument about 'rights'.
1.8.1.6. Pro: Healthcare is a human right, but being paid to provide medical services and research also is a human right. You have to be able to pay for it.
1.8.1.6.1. Con: This is not mutually exclusive with it being a human right. The paying could be done with taxes.
1.8.1.6.2. Con: Many accepted Human rights [have conflicts](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199238781.001.0001/acprof-9780199238781-chapter-4) between them.  In a developed nation, the Procedural Right to getting paid could co-exist with the [Substantive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantive_rights) right to healthcare.
1.8.1.6.3. Con: A thing can be a right, but not be available to all.
The [right to a fair trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights#Right_to_a_fair_trial) might not be available in some countries due to that countries failings \(war, government collapse\), but it is still a human right. Therefore, saying that there is a cost involved for something does not mean it cannot be a human right.
1.8.2. Pro: If a sick person has a right to health care and they cannot afford it, then they have a claim on the resources of other people. Without specifying a limit on the amount a sick person is entitled to, in theory such a right could deprive the healthy of all their resources in order to support the treatment of the sick. Since there should be a reasonable limit to one's contribution, health care cannot be an absolute right.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Rights can be loosely defined as things you would be justified in defending with a baseball bat. If you have a cold, you do not have the right to threaten a doctor into treating you.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: That's a way too arbitrary definition.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Statistically, 1% of the population [consistently uses](https://meps.ahrq.gov/data_files/publications/st354/stat354.shtml) up to 20% of the total health care expenditure in the US, and 5% uses almost 50%. This is not a fair distribution of resources.
1.8.2.2.1. Con: Equal distribution is not needed for a human right, only equal opportunity. Vaguely 2.5% of the population uses all judicial expenditure in the UK \(around 400,000 cases were received in [Q4 2017/18](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/623096/ccsq-bulletin-jan-mar-2017.pdf), which could suggest that only 2.5% \(1.6million/65.5million\) annually are causing the expenditure\). This is not an even distribution of cost, but is not a reason to remove the right to trials and justice.
1.8.2.2.1.1. Pro: "Human right" doesn't mean equal application. It just means guaranteed opportunity for.
1.8.2.2.1.1.1. Con: This suggests that there isn't a right to health care, merely a right to pursue health care.
1.8.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Or it can suggest the right to health care means you have a right to pursue \(and have guaranteed opportunity to get\) a reasonable level of care. You don't the the right to get the same heath care as someone in another country, but you do have the right to have the best your country can afford to reasonably provide.
1.8.2.3. Con: No right is absolute - one's right to liberty cannot come at the expense of another's, for example.
1.8.2.4. Con: All accepted human rights allow people to make claims on the resources of others. This means we must be prudent in how a right is exercised - it does not mean we discard a right's validity.
1.8.2.5. Con: When this is applied to the larger public one person alone will not have to bear a huge price toward this cause. Besides, health care is something that everyone needs at some point so the amount you paid for will ultimately help you and your neighbour. The only matter is that it would be in different proportions which can go anyway depending on fate.
1.8.2.6. Con: Human rights aren't national laws, at least in the US. It's an aspirational principle enforced in discourse; and insofar as the access to health - in principle - is an absolutely basic necessity of living a life capable of productivity, financial and otherwise, makes it a worthy end within that lexicon.
1.8.3. Pro: If healthcare was not measured by monetary terms and the medical industry was not an industry but a service for betterment of the society then medical care would be a human right but when this same industry gives you the highest profit margin it is not fair to provide it for free.
1.8.3.1. Con: There exist mixed systems, such as [in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Germany#Public_insurance). Monetary interest persists, yet everyone obtains health care regardless of the income.
1.8.3.2. Con: Everything is measured in monetary terms, even when doing so has a negative impact. We cannot easily change this, since to do so would require modifying some of our most basic tenets, upon which our economy is based.
1.8.4. Con: The same can be argued of food, a necessity for all human lives. Yet no arguments are made for the existence of farmers providing for the rest of humanity.
1.8.4.1. Con: It is absurd for one to claim that "no arguments are made" about a specific topic, simply because one is not aware of them.
1.8.4.2. Con: It is not inherently true that one needs others to source, obtain, and prepare food \(even though how modern society functions makes it seem otherwise\). Conversely, one must always count on the actions of others in order to receive healthcare.
1.8.5. Pro: Free Health Care is an investment into a human population by a government or organisation, it can't be considered an inherent human right, its a line item on someone's budget sheet and dependent on available resources.
1.8.5.1. Con: Many other human rights are also investments in a countries population - incidentally being an investment does not change whether they are Human Rights or not.
1.8.5.1.1. Pro: One example is [Education](https://www.kialo.com/is-health-care-a-human-right-7304/7304.0=7304.1-7304.47-7304.121+7304.85), which is a Human Right but also a very large investment in the population.
1.8.5.1.2. Pro: Human rights to [food, housing, and standard of life](https://www.kialo.com/is-health-care-a-human-right-7304/7304.0=7304.1-7304.47-7304.121+7304.129) can be seen as an investment in a population, as they are necessary stepping stones for a citizen to become productive in society.
1.8.5.2. Con: Free health care does not exist.
1.8.5.2.1. Con: Free healthcare in this instance is referring to it being free for consumers, rather than having no cost to society as a whole.
1.8.5.3. Con: Not all investments are prudent investments.
1.8.6. Con: People will not be forced to provide health care. Doctors still get paid, it's a matter of eliminating insurance as middle man and not assuming the price for medical care is the "real cost".  The primary driver of healthcare cost is ironically [insurance companies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeDOQpfaUc8). Healthcare could be cheaper, be subsidized by the government, and providers can be paid more, at the same time.
1.8.6.1. Con: Subsidies [don't make things cheaper](https://www.machinedesign.com/engineering-education/subsidies-increase-prices).
1.8.6.1.1. Pro: Subsidies drive demand \(artificially\). Higher demand means higher prices, or a reduced supply which also means higher prices for the remaining supply.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand)
1.8.6.1.1.1. Con: Subsidies are normally only applied to items which are considered essential, eg farming and energy. Demand for fuel does not significantly change with price, because people already need to use fuel at a mostly set level. While supply affects the method of making energy \(coal/green/nuclear\) it doesn't significantly affect the end users consumption choices.
1.8.6.2. Con: This scenario simply replaces insurance companies with government. Government is typically less accountable than a competitive private sector. The ideal scenario is to remove as many barriers between people and their health providers.
1.8.6.3. Con: The bureaucracy imparted on the system is driving costs up and ultimately that is the fault of a creeping scope of regulation over the past 60 years.
1.8.6.4. Con: If health care is a right, doctors must be forced to provide health care if they do not do so willingly. That is the nature of a right. If the question is about management of money for health care, we are not talking about rights anymore.
1.8.6.5. Con: In the U.S. that actually happens now and is unconstitutional. Doctors and hospitals are [required by law to accept](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395dd) indigent patients and care for them. They are not paid for this service. As a result, they must reduce their profit, make other patients pay for it, or take a loss. In any event this violates the 5th amendment of the Constitution ; "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."
1.8.7. Pro: A human right is something society is entitled to provide via a government. If governments are required to provide everyone with health care as a human right, they will have to ensure a supply of health care professionals to meet the demand, and this would entail compulsion of some individuals to train as health care professionals when the supply inevitably drops due to lower wage incentives to practice medicine inherent in government-provided healthcare.
1.8.7.1. Con: Human rights are often defined as inalienable, fundamental rights inherent to all human beings "[regardless of their nation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights)". The parent claim might therefore apply to the [legal rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights#Natural_versus_legal) of a government rather than human rights.
1.9. Con: Health care is a finite resource, with many components, so it cannot be provided to every person equally. This means it cannot be a right.
1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.1.
1.9.2. Pro: Fiercely contested components \(e.g. organ donations\) should be offered in terms of clinical suitability and likelihood of improvement, not equally.
1.9.2.1. Con: If finite resources such as organs are offered where they can have the most positive impact, then it's an exercise of the belief that the whole population's health should be improved. This is very similar to the belief that all humans in the population equally deserve health improvements.
1.9.3. Con: Healthcare as a finite resource does not mean that it cannot be considered a right. Disproved by water as a finite resource yet the [UN defines right to water as a human right upon which others depend.](http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/human_right_to_water.shtml)
1.9.3.1. Con: Because a government body considers something a right does not necessarily make it such.
1.9.3.1.1. Con: This is not a government body, it is a council with representation of 47 members representing every region in the world. It's [decisions](https://www.right2water.eu/sites/water/files/UNHRC%20Resolution%2015-9.pdf) are the combined knowledge of the most important humans rights body in the world.
1.9.3.1.1.1. Con: If a council representing every region in the world declares something a human right it doesn't necessarily make it a right even with the combined knowledge of the world.
1.9.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The fact is that whatever that council states is unanimously accepted as a right throughout the world. Your opposition towards it is only a mere a opinion.
1.9.3.2. Con: Health care does not occur naturally. If water comes through a pipe or in a bottle you still pay for it.
1.9.3.2.1. Con: Water is a human right wether it is found naturally, paid for by the bottle, or delivered by pipe. The right to water [includes](http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/human_right_to_water.shtml) it being Affordable \(less than 3% of household income\), Physically accessible \(delivered to the house, as opposed to having to travel somewhere to acquire it\) and sufficient \(including for washing clothes and hygiene \). Being natural is not a requirement for a human right.
1.9.3.3. Con: It is a lot easier to provide someone with clean water than with quality health care, so this is not a good comparison.
1.9.4. Con: Food and shelter are finite resources, but generally accepted as basic human rights.
1.9.4.1. Con: If something is considered a basic human right, you shouldn't pay for it. You don't buy a ticket to exercise free speech. We are NOT giving everyone equal rights to something, if they need to pay for it. It becomes a question of whether or not they can afford it.
1.9.4.2. Con: "General acceptance" does not denote truth. There are many cases where people generally accept something but the claims are either unproved or demonstrably false.
1.9.4.2.1. Con: In this case, it is likely truthful as it is also [internationally legally accepted](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/what-are-human-rights/what-universal-declaration-human-rights). There are also no known groups advocating for food and shelter to be removed as a human right. This means that it is very likely correct that human beings deserve food and shelter.
1.9.4.3. Con: Sufficient food and shelter for basic survival and dignity is well known, whereas sufficient health care fore the same differs dramatically depending on one's medical condition.
1.9.5. Con: A 'right' is not based on it's cost or availability or material requirements. Many generally accepted rights are limited by real circumstances. But we do not usually accept that 'the pursuit of happiness' is too expensive to be a right for everyone.
1.9.5.1. Con: Health care is unique because it is much more expensive than any other necessary good like food or water. It is also not readily available from nature.
1.9.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.1.2.3.2.
1.9.5.2. Con: Persuit of happiness is free. It's up to each individual to decide what that means. There is no requirement from other people in order for you to persue personal happiness.
1.9.6. Con: Many countries \(e.g., most in Europe\) provide healthcare equally to all their citizens funding it with taxes. In this way everyone pays taxes proportionally to what they earn, and everybody gets healthcare. Nobody has to go bankrupt because they can't afford healthcare or medical cost, and the country receives all the money needed to run the healthcare system, which does not "run out" of resources until wages are paid and supplies are bought.
1.9.7. Pro: Declaring health care to be a human right could either be meaningless if referring to a minimal quality, or ruinous if referring to a high quality. The inability to quantify the exact amount which should be owed to each person makes a right to health care impractical.
1.9.7.1. Con: Many other human rights have semi-vague quantifications, and still function well. The specifics can be left to each government.
1.9.7.1.1. Pro: The human right to education is [only required to be](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) "made generally available", and higher education has to be "equally accessible to all on the basis of merit". Education is a well functioning human right despite the minimum/maximum quantity being unspecified.
1.9.7.1.2. Pro: The right to work has [no specific qualifications](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) like hours worked or pay, it merely specifies "free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment." and protects from discrimination.
1.9.8. Con: This is a non sequitur because whether something is available in unlimited quantities does not determine if people have a right to it. We all have a right to live, therefore to breathe even though the amount of air in the atmosphere is finite. The right to live is connected to the right to medical care whether or not the current supply is sufficient for our needs. Rights are not dependent on surpluses or shortages in supply.
1.9.8.1. Con: If something is considered a right, and the state cannot provide this right to everyone, the state is in violation of its own laws, opening the state up to litigation.
1.9.9. Con: -> See 1.8.2.2.1.1.
1.10. Pro: A healthy society is a productive society. Providing health care to all will promote/improve our economy.
1.10.1. Pro: The combined economic impact of ill-health currently sits at a [£77.5 billion a year](https://www.consultancy.uk/news/15551/sick-staff-cost-british-firms-77-billion-annually-in-lost-productivity) for the UK economy.
1.10.1.1. Con: This is lower than the UKs Health Care budget, of [£145 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending_in_the_United_Kingdom).
1.10.2. Pro: Universally available health care results in more preventative measures and lifestyle modification, which is vastly more cost effective and has better outcomes.
1.10.3. Con: While society benefits from the health of its members, and in reassuring people that they will be taken care of, the state should not make promises which it cannot keep. There must be a limit on the amount of assistance provided publicly because state budgets are not infinite.
1.10.4. Con: As has been seen around history, a government is the worst provider of this type of services. By giving them the power to run the health industry, a completely inefficient system is created, with very high prices, with dull processes and bureaucracy. Not to mention corruption and monopolies.
1.10.4.1. Con: This is not what the [data from WHO](http://www.who.int/healthinfo/paper30.pdf) says.
1.10.4.2. Con: Universal Healthcare can be cheaper and more efficient than the alternatives.
1.10.4.2.1. Pro: US government's spending on healthcare [outstrips UK government spending](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42950587), both in terms of the proportion of its GDP, and in terms of how much it spends per head.
1.10.5. Con: There are many healthy societies that are not necessarily more productive societies. This seems like a unrealistic generalization especially with America being so unhealthy and so productive.
1.10.5.1. Con: This does not invalidate the claim that unhealthy societies will be, by their definition, less productive. Healthy societies are [empirically more productive](https://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTPREMNET/Resources/489960-1338997241035/Growth_Commission_Working_Paper_24_Population_Health_Economic_Growth.pdf).
1.10.5.2. Con: By many global standards \(e.g. life expectancy, infant mortality, immunization rate...\), America is not unhealthy.
1.10.6. Con: An improved economy is not a characteristic of a human right.
1.10.7. Pro: [Herd immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity) will suffer if the majority of the population is not inoculated.
1.11. Con: Society shouldn't be responsible for paying for other individual's poor health and choices.
1.11.1. Con: Society is already responsible in many developed nations, for the health of individual vulnerable groups. Including medicare and medicaid in the US. Ethically speaking, society should aid it's population and economically speaking it might make sense, although it would require a whole private medical industry to dramatically cut earning.
1.11.2. Pro: Individuals who make decisions throughout their life such as choosing to smoke contribute to the likelihood that they will develop certain diseases later in life. The individual has to take responsibility for this.
1.11.2.1. Con: People may be made to compensate for their unhealthy behavior by a clever redistribution. Say, by imposing additional taxation on cigarettes, a state can make smokers effectively pay in advance for their possible smoking-related healthcare costs.
1.11.2.1.1. Pro: The tax earned would be a bonus on top of the reduction in damage. A study found that a [20% fat tax](https://www.bmj.com/press-releases/2012/05/14/20-%E2%80%9Cfat-tax%E2%80%9D-needed-improve-population-health), alongside healthy food subsidies, would provide a significant effect on diet-related conditions such as obesity and heart disease. Ring-fencing the tax specifically for healthcare would only increase the effect.
1.11.2.2. Con: Many of the "bad" habits that people "choose" aren't really about choice. The manufacturers, advertisers, and retailers who promote, advertise aggressively, and glorify these behaviors have a major responsibility for the poor health of society.
1.11.2.3. Con: While some health issues have a personal responsibility aspect \(smoking, substance abuse\) other issues are not under the individual's control \(many cancers, genetic disorders, accidents and injuries, pandemics\). To sustain a society implies a social contract where members support each other. Health care is definitely within that realm. The question is to what degree.
1.11.2.3.1. Con: The degree to which there is an expectation for guaranteed health care is at the heart of this overall debate. If everyone has a right to emergency room care, that very well could satisfy the overarching claim. Heart disease, lung cancer, suicide, motor vehicle accidents, and drug overdoses all present behavior-induced health crises which society could minimize through regulating personal liberties as preventive medicine. Government must do this if health care is a right.
1.11.2.4. Con: So far, it is almost impossible to affirm that a certain disease is 100% the result of a certain behavior. If a smoker gets sick with lung cancer, we can only say that probably smoke has increased his/her susceptibility, but we have to consider so many collateral aspects that most of the times are ignored. For instance: genetic predisposition, work conditions, environmental status of the place he/she lives, and so on.
1.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.
1.11.4. Pro: If you take better care of yourself, you can afford health care.
1.11.4.1. Con: Healthy behavior does not guarantee a good health. Because people are born with diseases that is a matter of inheritance and not choice.
1.11.4.2. Con: Health care isn't just about lifestyle. Many people end up with astronomical healthcare bills from accidents and injury.
1.11.4.3. Con: There are compounding factors that influence a persons health that are independent of choice, for example, being born into poverty.
1.11.4.3.1. Pro: Also accidents, epidemics \(thousands of healthy people died this year from the flu\), and the ultimate equalizer, old age.  We're all going there if we're lucky.
1.11.5. Con: Existing modern societies all require citizens to pay for other individuals choices. This ranges from paying for policing / prisons, to paying for litter picking / repairing vandalism.
1.11.5.1. Con: Situations like these exist, but we should make an effort to minimize them when possible. Particularly when it's a knowing, intentional decision to inflict disproportionate cost on society for an individual's benefit.
1.11.5.1.1. Con: Every current society trades some individual freedoms for security. If the example of policing is a traded freedom, then healthcare should be too. We trade away the freedom to commit crimes for the security of being safe from crimes committed against us. Minimising the amount of freedom traded is important; we should minimize societies power to prevent crimes, so that society does not become totalitarian. But that does not mean those freedoms shouldn't be traded at an appropriate level.
1.11.5.1.1.1. Con: Crimes are not committed in a vacuum; a victim generally suffers from the actions of a perpetrator. Committing crimes is not a freedom because one person's freedom ends where another person's freedom begins.
1.11.5.1.1.2. Con: Even assuming this argument is valid, it is difficult to determine what is an "appropriate level" of trading freedoms.
1.11.5.1.1.3. Con: Just because we treat policing in a certain way, that does not mean we should view healthcare similarly.
1.11.5.1.2. Con: If desired, a healthcare system could be minimized the same way as policing is. A way to minimize policing is to remove rights from someone if they are convicted of a crime. For example if you steal \(an intentional decision to inflict cost on society for an individuals benefit\) you will have your freedoms restricted through prison and other restrictions. Minimization of healthcare could be achieved similarly, if desired, by reducing a persons right to healthcare for self-inflicted issues.
1.11.5.2. Con: Whether something exists or how widespread its practice is at any given point in time is not an indication of its social utility.
1.11.5.2.1. Con: However it is a precedent for society being responsible for choices even if they are poor ones, which is the point contested by the claim.
1.11.6. Con: -> See 1.5.
1.11.7. Con: Selecting out individuals who exhibit 'poor health and choices' is a slippery slope that would have unintended consequences.
1.11.7.1. Con: Automatically treating individuals who create an undue demand on the system through poor choices is a slippery slope that would have unintended consequences.
1.11.7.1.1. Con: This is not a slippery slope fallacy, as there is nowhere to slide to. If you already treat 100% of people, you cannot start treating 101%. The parent slippery slope argument works because if you are selective and choose to treat 90% of people, that you are then more likely to start treating 89%... then 88%... etc..
1.11.8. Pro: If society were paying for health care, then society would naturally take an opinion on what individual behaviors or food choices are acceptable and which should be discouraged. This would undermine people's freedom to live the lives they want.
1.11.9. Con: Existing modern societies regularly have individuals pay for things they do not use. The argument is similar to the failed argument "I don't drive so I shouldn't pay taxes towards roads".
1.11.9.1. Con: The arguments are similar but neither fail because of their similarity. Much of health care is about making good decisions. Both roads and certain medical treatments reward poor decision making. To say both need to be funded “because” avoids responsibility for the bad consequences.
