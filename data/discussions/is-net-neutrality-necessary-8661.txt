Discussion Title: Is Net Neutrality Necessary?

1. The internet will be better off without Net Neutrality regulations.
1.1. Pro: Net Neutrality prevents ISPs from offering new forms of services that could benefit them, users, or the broader economy.
1.1.1. Con: According to F.A. Hayek's "knowledge problem," carefully articulated in "The Use of Knowledge in Society," regulators cannot acquire the necessary knowledge regarding resource constraints, demand, supply, and personal preference adjusted for a given time, a given location, and/or a given actor. Therefore, any regulator's attempt to install their preferences over the preferences and the underlying economic reality affecting freely cooperating individuals necessarily diminishes social welfare.
1.1.1.1. Con: Well-functioning markets [depend on detailed rules](https://hbr.org/2007/10/the-art-of-designing-markets) The role of the regulator — setting the rules of the game — can stimulate more effective competition to maximize social welfare under the constraint of reaching a socially desirable outcome.
1.1.1.2. Con: Social welfare is a good basis for discussion, but Hayek is assuming a functioning market. For Hayek's assertion to be relevant, there needs to be market mechanisms that will improve social welfare for the specific case of Internet access services. This is unlikely to be the case due to the barriers to entry that allow monopoly behavior by the Internet operators and benefit the operators rather than broader society.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Monopolies don't exist in a free market. Governments have erected countless barriers that make competition harder and more expensive, entrenching and exacerbating any monopoly concerns we might have. This kind of interference is [particularly prevalent in the ISP market](https://www.wired.com/2013/07/we-need-to-stop-focusing-on-just-cable-companies-and-blame-local-government-for-dismal-broadband-competition/).
1.1.1.3. Con: The claim that people are "freely cooperating" glosses over questions of necessity and inequality. In this particular case, the inequality between an isolated consumer and a giant monopoly is extreme.
1.1.2. Pro: Government regulations often have unseen effects and can fail to accurately predict or enforce outcomes. Given that the harms of removing net neutrality have yet to occur it is better to [deregulate the industry and use subsequent legislation to address any specific harms that emerge](https://stratechery.com/2017/pro-neutrality-anti-title-ii/).
1.1.2.1. Con: There are [several documented examples of harm that occurred before net-neutrality regulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7elqw7/redditor_lists_all_the_times_ipss_have_illegally/).
1.1.2.2. Con: Removing protections then adding them back when harm arises is a waste of time and will harm consumers. If there is a reasonable case that harm will be caused, protections should be left in place.
1.1.2.3. Con: It is just as correct to say that a lack of government regulations often has unseen effects. Many of the existing harms of Net Neutrality have yet to happen, have been blown out of proportion, or have been fabrications to steer public opinion. It's foolish to eliminate protections based on what might happen when those protections protect us from what have happened.
1.1.2.4. Con: Unseen effects are often more severe with specific legislation because specific regulations aren't broad and consistent rules like Net Neutrality laws. They require situation-specific knowledge that is difficult and sometimes impossible to obtain.
1.1.3. Con: Prior to 2015 there were no Net Neutrality regulations applied to ISPs in the US and yet the internet there had developed as an open and free system.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Over-regulation was highly harmful to the quality of US communications services in the 70s and 80s when the status and regulation of Ma Bell as a monopoly / common carrier suppressed competition. After de-regulation consumers were given much better service and choice.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: This comparison is not valid because the claimed problem in the case of Bell was government protection of the business rather than protection of consumers.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
1.1.3.2. Con: As 2015 approached US lawmakers realized that given certain ISP and regulation trends, the internet was becoming less free and needed to be given the same protections that utility regulations provide for other industries. Thus, the implication that no regulations were needed after 2015 ignores the reasoning behind the change.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Government-regulated industries tend to stagnate. The relatively unregulated Internet has thrived. In 2001, there were 10,620 [regulated radio stations](https://www.statista.com/statistics/252235/number-of-commercial-radio-stations-in-the-us/); in 2015, there are 10,927. In 2001, there were 56M [daily newspapers circulated](http://www.journalism.org/fact-sheet/newspapers/); in 2015, only 38M.  What about lightly regulated Internet? In 2001, there were 29.2 million Internet [websites](http://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/); in 2015, there are 863 million.
1.1.4. Pro: Regulation is not necessary when [competition would resolve the concerns around net neutrality](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-13/forget-net-neutrality-what-americans-need-is-net-competition).
1.1.4.1. Con: Current competition surrounding the US internet closely resembles prior facilities currently controlled by the FCC such as phone and radio wave usage, television frequencies, and zoning rights for coax cables and laying. Even in an open economy it is vital to have rules. Time Warner, Comcast, and Verizon did not regulate themselves; they had to be throttled back.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Stopping [local governments from creating monopolistic franchise agreements with large ISPs](https://thedigitalfirehose.blogspot.com/2014/07/a-government-protected-monopoly-is-not.html) and [restricting access to cable right-of-ways](https://www.wired.com/2013/07/we-need-to-stop-focusing-on-just-cable-companies-and-blame-local-government-for-dismal-broadband-competition/) would be more beneficial to consumers and less harmful to technology markets and innovation than government forcing ISPs to act in mandated ways.
1.1.4.2. Con: Competition cannot resolve anything in the many, many areas of the US where one ISP monopolizes all service availability. Killing net neutrality will not introduce new competition to these areas.
1.1.4.3. Con: When radio was deregulated, this led to a decrease in [competition](https://www.futureofmusic.org/article/research/radio-deregulation-has-it-served-musicians-and-citizens).
1.1.4.4. Pro: Net Neutrality decreases the ability of [smaller ISPs](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/13/15949920/net-neutrality-killing-small-isps) to compete with larger ISPs because it imposes new costs in reporting and complying with Net Neutrality rules. Larger firms can more easily absorb these rules as they can more readily absorb fixed costs.
1.1.4.5. Pro: Granting the government greater power to regulate ISPs would mean that large ISPs who can afford lobbyists gain greater control of the system.
1.1.4.5.1. Pro: AT&T, Verizon and Comcast are all within the top ten [biggest lobbyists](http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/01/investing/companies-lobbying-10-biggest-spenders/index.html) in the U.S.
1.1.4.5.2. Con: The ISPs themselves [have denied/undermined the suggestion that the regulations notably hurt their businesses](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/title-ii-hasnt-hurt-network-investment-according-to-the-isps-themselves/).
1.1.4.6. Con: Competition is not an appropriate economic policy on critical infrastructure. You typically do not see competing roads, water supplies, or electricity providers.
1.1.5. Pro: [Zero Rating](https://betanews.com/2017/12/14/the-case-against-net-neutrality-an-it-pros-perspective/) allows customers unlimited access to certain websites regardless of any data caps. Such services benefit users but violate net neutrality.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Discrimination can also create pro-competitive effects, such as when T-Mobile's launch of zero-rating services [lead to customers switching to the plans and increased competition](https://stratechery.com/2017/pro-neutrality-anti-title-ii/).
1.1.5.2. Pro: This allows customers greater access to popular websites.
1.1.5.3. Con: Zero Rating may be anti-competitive in that it allows ISPs to give preference to some websites over others.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Bigger companies gain a benefit over smaller companies if they can pay ISPs more money to ensure they are on Zero Rated lists.
1.1.6. Pro: Net neutrality inhibits the ability of ISPs to provide its customers with options. Its end means that those who need high speed internet have the option to pay more for it, while others, such as low-income families who don't require a faster connection, can purchase a cheaper, slower plan. In both scenarios this offers incentives for more people to sign up, benefiting both them and the broader economy.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Certain provisions, such as restrictions against peering and zero-rating, can function as a hidden subsidy from consumers to major tech companies, driving up broadband costs for average users by forcing ISPs to socialize some concentrated costs of servicing high-volume customers \(i.e. YouTube or Netflix\) across the whole network regardless of usage.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: With Net Neutrality, consumers overall will have to pay more than what they would have to pay without it because everyone has to bear the costs of high-cost services. If ISPs could charge users of high-cost services extra, then they could reduce costs for the rest of consumers. In essence, Net Neutrality hurts consumers in a way somewhat similar to [price ceilings.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-ceiling.asp)
1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Charging some users higher prices also allows for other users to be charged lower prices, meaning that internet access could be more affordable for the poor.
1.1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: The 'lower' limit of the cost of internet access is currently inflated because ISPs cannot ensure users don't access certain services that impose large costs \(say high-quality video streaming\). By blocking access to those services ISPs can lower prices to better capture new customers who otherwise could not afford internet access.
1.1.6.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Data is data. It is that data is being transferred, the amount and speed at which the data is transmitted that impacts ISPs, not whether the data is music or a picture of your aunt.
1.1.6.1.1.1.2. Pro: For instance, [Facebook Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Zero) allows millions of people the ability to access the internet for free. While it only allows for free access to Facebook services, that is still more choice than consumers would otherwise have had.
1.1.6.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: [Wikipedia](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Zero) and [Google](https://get.google.com/apptips/apps/?utm_source=googlemobile&utm_campaign=redirect#!/all) also offer similar services.
1.1.6.1.1.1.2.2. Con: But Facebook Zero \(and other such "Zero" programs\) subjectively advantage the Facebook brand and content in the free market of ideas. Also, in some cases, the \(usually wireless\) ISPs that sign on for these Zero plans are only treating them as temporary promotions. In other words, hook the customers on the content for free, then remove the free access, drawing the "addicted" customer into a new habit of access to the \(now non-free\) Facebook site.
1.1.6.1.1.1.3. Con: Just because ISPs charge higher prices to some users does not mean that they will lower prices for others in any way. It is more likely that ISPs will deliver the internet at whatever price the market bears, i.e. free to emerging markets as in the case of Facebook Zero.
1.1.6.1.1.1.4. Con: De-regulation causes people in "unprofitable" areas to be left out or forced to pay a premium. De-regulation decreases diversity of content and consolidates power in a few large companies.
[2002 Research on deregulation of radio](http://www.futureofmusic.org/sites/default/files/FMCradiostudy.pdf)
1.1.6.1.1.1.5. Con: Internet packages are already price-tiered according to total speed.
1.1.6.1.1.2. Pro: Being able to leverage [price discrimination](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjhqczzvdvXAhWIHZQKHS3BCAUQFggsMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPrice_discrimination&usg=AOvVaw1qiUeP2ztM0O5gMupZXCsx) over different types of internet traffic ISPs can extract more profit \(by charging higher prices\) for the types of traffic that wealthier users tend to access.
1.1.6.1.1.2.1. Con: Price discrimination also places some parts of the internet out of reach of the poorer internet users.
1.1.6.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.1.
1.1.6.1.1.3. Pro: By charging per-service ISPs can better extract profit from people who use a diverse range of services, as those users are more likely to be able to afford higher prices.
1.1.6.1.1.3.1. Pro: For example, users who subscribe to many streaming services are more likely to be able to afford higher prices for internet plans given they can already afford the costs of so many services.
1.1.6.1.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.1.
1.1.6.1.1.3.3. Con: This could unfairly allow ISPs to monetise the services of third parties by charging users to access those services.
1.1.6.1.1.4. Pro: Certain provisions, such as restrictions against peering and zero-rating, can function as a hidden subsidy from consumers to major tech companies, driving up broadband costs for average users by forcing ISPs to socialize some concentrated costs of servicing high-volume customers \(i.e. YouTube or Netflix\) across the whole network regardless of usage.
1.1.6.1.1.4.1. Pro: High-bandwidth content providers such as Netflix [have often signed agreements where they proactively pay ISPs](https://qz.com/256586/the-inside-story-of-how-netflix-came-to-pay-comcast-for-internet-traffic/) to ensure a reliable delivery of content. This indicates that providing the bandwidth for such services creates large costs for ISPs to meet \(to the point where high-bandwidth services are proactively paying them to offset those costs\).
1.1.6.1.1.4.2. Pro: Streaming video in particular [is extremely bandwidth intensive](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-much-ip-traffic-will-be-video-by-2021-2017-6/?r=AU&IR=T) as compared to using standard web services such as news sites or social media. Users who heavily use services such as Netflix are likely 'costing' ISPs a great deal more \(in terms of bandwidth consumption\) than users who do not; meaning they are in effect subsidised by lower-bandwidth users.
1.1.6.1.1.4.3. Con: Even if we suppose that these provisions do act as a hidden subsidy, there has been no explanation as to how harmful this "hidden subsidy" is. It could be a mere 1-5% gross \(i.e. non-net\) decrease in efficiency. Although it could also be higher, there have not been any estimates put forward, and we thus should not assume that the \(supposed\) harm is significant. The "subsidy" could even be an efficient distortion for all we know.
1.1.6.1.1.4.4. Con: \(Perhaps\) in some circumstances it "can" function as a hidden subsidy, but when internet usage is charged per bandwidth/data used this problem disappears. Thus, the issue is not net neutrality, but the problem of not applying metering/etc.
1.1.6.1.1.5. Con: ISPs can solve this by charging different rates for different connection speeds, not by determining which sites users can freely access.
1.1.6.1.1.6. Con: Preserving Net Neutrality preserves constant and consistent access to service for low income citizens and residents. Even if it were abolished — and this created competitive affordable prices eventually — the poor might lose many job opportunities, safety technology, and communication abilities until prices evened out.
1.1.6.1.1.6.1. Con: Many people do not need high-speed, low-latency Internet access. For instance, those who only use it to "surf the net" with a web browser.
1.1.6.1.1.7. Pro: I think what you are trying to say is that removing net neutrality eliminates cross-subsidies between customers. By charging customers what they are willing to pay for internet services, which is higher than the costs of service, you can redistribute the gains to reduce prices for other consumers.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: High-bandwidth content providers such as Netflix [have often signed agreements where they proactively pay ISPs](https://qz.com/256586/the-inside-story-of-how-netflix-came-to-pay-comcast-for-internet-traffic/) to ensure a reliable delivery of content. This indicates that providing the bandwidth for such services creates large costs for ISPs to meet \(to the point where high-bandwidth services are proactively paying them to offset those costs\).
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: Streaming video in particular [is extremely bandwidth intensive](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-much-ip-traffic-will-be-video-by-2021-2017-6/?r=AU&IR=T) as compared to using standard web services such as news sites or social media. Users who heavily use services such as Netflix are likely 'costing' ISPs a great deal more \(in terms of bandwidth consumption\) than users who do not; meaning they are in effect subsidised by lower-bandwidth users.
1.1.6.1.3.1. Con: By buying slower or smaller [packages](https://www.verizon.com/info/internet-plans/), lower-bandwidth users can avoid subsidizing high-bandwidth users; even under net neutrality.
1.1.6.1.4. Con: Even if we suppose that these provisions do act as a hidden subsidy, it's unclear if this "hidden subsidy" is significant. If it only raises costs by a percentage point or two, then an open and equal access web is worth the price.
1.1.6.1.5. Con: Perhaps in some circumstances it can function as a hidden subsidy; but when internet usage is charged per bandwidth/data used this problem disappears. Thus, the issue is not net neutrality, but the problem of not applying metering or other provisions that better target use without discriminating.
1.1.7. Pro: Net Neutrality would prevent ISPs from offering the valuable service of data prioritization to customers.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Net Neutrality prevents critical internet services, such as online medicine, operating with guarantees of reliability and speed.
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: [Quality of Service](https://www.networkcomputing.com/networking/basics-qos/402199215) requirements for Video and VoiP are different than other types of internet traffic.
1.1.7.1.2. Pro: An "[Internet Rush Hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Rush_Hour)" is a common occurrence where the presence of so many simultaneous users slows traffic across the entire network. Requiring Net Neutrality prevents companies from easing this flow via peak period fees which encourage using the internet at different times \(and/or could decrease overall costs\).
1.1.7.1.2.1. Con: This would still be true for a system without Net Neutrality; except that higher paying customers would get service and lower paying customers would not.
1.1.7.1.2.2. Con: This is an issue that ISP's need to solve, since it is a consequence of what they are offering. If they don't like it they need to improve their network — we also don't make fast lanes on the highway because we have traffic jams.
1.1.7.1.2.2.1. Con: That last sentence is false; states such as Georgia have hybrid premium/HOV/Electric lanes, such as the Peach Pass lanes. With exceptions for electric vehicles or HOVs, these lanes charge more during times of high traffic. See [here](https://georgia.gov/blog/2017-02-22/everything-you-need-know-about-using-peach-pass) for more information.
1.1.7.1.3. Pro: There are calls for a [health "fast lane" to the internet](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01947648.2017.1284701?scroll=top&needAccess=true). Without it a surgeon might not get enough bandwidth during peak usage periods because their connection is treated with the same priority as the connection of a YouTube viewer.
1.1.7.1.3.1. Con: Internet packages are already price-tiered according to total speed.
1.1.7.1.4. Pro: There exist applications like remote surgery where the consequences of QoS \(quality of service\) failure for even a few seconds are much worse than somewhat worse performance for most applications. To achieve that reliability the networks need to be able to prioritize their traffic.
1.1.7.1.4.1. Con: It is unreasonable to change a whole network just because a tiny subset needs it to have different specifications. You don't double the size of the roads because every once in a while a special load needs to pass which needs that width. Instead you find a different solution to that special need.
1.1.7.1.4.1.1. Con: There is no solution to jitter other than adding latency. There is no solution to high latency that can be done on a per application basis. Either you allow carriers to prioritize traffic or low latency applications simply can't use the internet.
1.1.7.1.4.2. Con: ISPs work together with companies like Youtube, Netflix and the like to implement extra fast internet connections from them to internet providers. This does not have anything to do with the consumer-side regulations that Net Neutrality implement.
1.1.7.1.4.3. Con: ISP's that supply high demand companies already make claims as to the reliability of their network and the bandwidth they will provide. Companies that use bandwidth on a large scale are sure to set these reliability and speed levels in their contracts with the ISP and they can sue the company for lost revenue if the service was not as agreed upon.
1.1.7.1.4.4. Pro: Businesses often require a faster and more reliable service for certain processes, such as credit card transactions.
1.1.7.1.5. Con: Doctors already have preferential access: most hospitals already have paid for higher speed-connections than those of many consumers. Abolishing Net Neutrality isn't going to increase the reliability or speed of doctors' internet access.
1.1.7.1.5.1. Con: "High speed connections" won't help if the network is being used over its capacity. Without a way to prioritize certain types of traffic, it won't be reliable enough for people to utilize these new technologies.
1.1.7.1.5.2. Pro: "High speed connections" can make healthcare less effective and more expensive because you will possibly need to pay a premium for extra stable/reliable internet with high bandwidth. This will potentially exclude hospitals in less fortunate areas because they can't afford the fees for stable internet, resulting in worse healthcare overall.
1.1.7.1.6. Con: Critical infrastructure such as surgical systems shouldn't have a single point of failure. If a degraded internet connection can negatively impact the outcome of a surgery this indicates the surgical system is improperly designed. A device shouldn't get priority because it's poorly designed and doesn't have redundant methods of communication.
1.1.7.1.6.1. Con: It would be very difficult, or expensive, to design a purpose-built internet-like system just to accomodate surgical systems. Satellite and mobile connections can't compete with the lower latencies of cabled connections; making these the most obvious and efficient choice for telemedicine.
1.1.7.1.6.2. Con: Dedicated communications circuits are a couple orders of magnitude more expensive than prioritized, switched, virtual communications channels, like what the Internet offers.
1.1.7.1.6.3. Con: "Redundant methods of communication" won't be possible in a regulated Internet. All access methods will be required by law to be identical. This could easily lead to a circumstance where one ISP's impediment would impede all ISPs.
1.1.7.1.7. Con: Net Neutrality does not hamper speed and reliability for critical services as [not all networks are completely 'neutral' even under Net Neutrality](http://www.circleid.com/posts/20160109_the_real_reason_why_network_neutrality_is_impossible/). For instance, banks have always had faster networks.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Generally, when companies offer customers a diversified set of options at varying price points, customers tend to benefit from the increase in choices. It's not clear why broadband is an exception to this rule.
1.1.8. Con: Internet provision is largely a utility service: users care about uptime and speed but there is little desire for new kinds of 'innovative' services.
1.2. Pro: Net Neutrality discourages network providers from investing in new infrastructure.
1.2.1. Pro: 2015, the year that net neutrality regulations were introduced in the US, was the first year in [which broadband network investment fell](http://reason.com/blog/2017/11/21/ajit-pai-net-neutrality-podcast?curator=MediaREDEF). This suggests that the effects of net neutrality create very real costs that reduce infrastructure investment.
1.2.1.1. Con: [Other analyses suggest](https://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/resources/internet-access-and-online-video-markets-are-thriving-in-title-II-era.pdf) that this decline was not a reaction to those regulations but instead a decline that was planned well ahead of time and a natural consequence of major infrastructure rollouts.
1.2.1.2. Con: [According to the ISPs themselves](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/title-ii-hasnt-hurt-network-investment-according-to-the-isps-themselves/), Net Neutrality has not hurt network investment at all. The [source](http://reason.com/blog/2017/11/21/ajit-pai-net-neutrality-podcast?curator=MediaREDEF) listed in the parent, however, is not credible: that claim is only "supported" by an [op-ed in the Wall Street Journal written by Ajit Pai himself](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-fcc-can-save-the-open-internet-1511281099). However, his claim that investment is down is disputed by ISPs' own words to their investors, as cited above.
1.2.2. Pro: Being able to charge more for premium services \(such as guaranteeing lower latencies for gaming\) better incentivises ISPs to build out new infrastructure that caters to these uses and thus ultimately leads to better service for people that need infrastructure-intensive forms of internet access.
1.2.2.1. Con: If ISPs are trying to maximize profit, it would make more sense to create a slower lane via throttling, and charge a premium price for what is now considered normal access. This would require no financial investment on their part; increasing their profit without any improvement in service.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: ISPs could also be incentivized to offer higher quality packages for lower prices in order to compete with one another.
1.2.3. Con: While it is true that investors should be given some freedom in operation, Net Neutrality does not take away all of companies' freedoms, just as [anti discrimination laws](https://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/history/herman/reports/futurework/conference/staffing/9.7_discrimination.htm) partially restrict companies' freedom when it comes to business operation. The basic principle is if ISPs choose to invest and operate in our country, they have to follow community-established rules.
1.2.3.1. Con: Net neutrality may not take away all or most of ISPs freedom, but it takes away their ability to offer more efficient services plans to customers like data prioritization plans.
1.2.4. Con: ISPs in the US had [high profit margins](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/07/24/isps-are-spending-less-on-their-networks-as-they-make-more-money-off-them/) [under net neutrality rules](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-kushnick/time-warner-cables-97-pro_b_6591916.html) yet still were not spending significant amounts on new infrastructure. This suggests that being able to charge more for services \(fast lanes, packaging plans\) wouldn't necessarily lead to more infrastructure investment as profit is not a key constraint.
1.2.4.1. Con: ISPs are profitable because they focus on existing networks and coverage areas. Net neutrality decreases the profit incentive to expand infrastructure to less populous areas since the customer base is too small. If ISPs could create more targeted plans with higher prices to sell in less populous areas it would increase the profit motive to expand regional infrastructures.
1.2.5. Con: Nobody will pay for a fast lane if there's no congestion. Thus, if fast lanes are possible it will be in the ISP's financial interest to ensure that there is not enough network capacity; likely leading to less infrastructure investment.
1.2.6. Pro: Net neutrality repeal means less investment in rural areas' ISP infrastructure, as ISPs will prioritize providing areas with a high customer density, such as major cities, with the fastest service.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Rural small businesses that rely on Internet access become non-competitive when they can't afford an ISP's premium service package.
1.2.6.2. Con: ISPs don't expand infrastructure to rural areas because the customer [population](https://venturebeat.com/2017/10/20/how-to-bridge-the-broadband-divide-allow-isps-to-bid-on-urban-rural-territories/) is often too small to recoup the infrastructure investment. This is true regardless of net neutrality rules.
1.2.6.3. Pro: Net neutrality is a necessary measure to ensure internet access for rural communities who could be priced out of the market in the absence of regulation.
1.3. Pro: Net Neutrality prevents ISPs from 'shaping' traffic on their network to help provide the best speeds for the majority of their customers.
1.3.1. Pro: It is common practice for infrastructure operators to use discriminatory pricing to improve efficiency. Road tolls use congestion pricing, electricity companies use off-peak pricing, water companies restrict use during droughts, etc.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Incentivising bandwidth intensive uses \(say uploading backups or downloading movies\) to happen during off-peak hours can help ensure that internet speeds are faster at peak times for everyone.
1.3.1.2. Con: Net Neutrality doesn't exclude putting in place restrictions that apply to everyone the same way, as drought restrictions would. It would only exclude restrictions based on selling the absence of restrictions.
1.3.2. Pro: Infrastructure operators need to be able to broadly control how infrastructure is used in order to best ensure equitable access. For example, if the streaming or torrenting of a minority of an ISP's users is consuming the majority of available bandwidth those users should have their speeds limited for the greater good.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Even basic throttling of peer-to-peer traffic [violates network neutrality rules](https://www.pcworld.com/article/200790/judge_approves_comcast_traffic_throttling_settlement.html).
1.3.2.2. Con: ISPs can already manage this with Net Neutrality in place through charging for and/or limiting bandwidth and data usage.
1.3.2.3. Con: Throttling doesn't solve the issue of high bandwidth usage, throttled users still need and want the bandwidth, they will only have to pay more. Users have little to do with this. If an ISP can't live up to it's promise of high bandwidth, it shouldn't promise it in the first place.
1.3.2.4. Pro: Net Neutrality allows for large-bandwidth services like Hulu, Netflix or Youtube to take a disproportional amount of bandwidth from shared internet networks.
1.3.2.4.1. Pro: It has been said that Netflix alone [accounts for 36%](http://fortune.com/2015/10/08/netflix-bandwith/) of Internet downstream traffic.
1.3.2.4.2. Con: A packet switched network as large as the internet should be used at or near capacity for maximum benefit, and Netflix scales its content to address capacity limitations.
1.3.3. Pro: It is impossible to design a network that makes good use of bandwidth for all users and use cases without being able to shape traffic.
1.3.3.1. Con: Just as you can pay for better speeds, it also seems reasonable that you could pay to prioritize different elements of your connection \(bandwidth, latency, jitter\). But you should be able to get the type of connection you want and then use it to use the open internet as you choose. This is no reason to repeal net neutrality, which ensures our ISPs can't choose which content they want us to be able to access and decide for us how fast they want different sites to be.
1.3.3.2. Pro: There are three different forms of 'good' internet access: high bandwidth \(lots of bits; good for Netflix\), low latency \(the time from when you submit a packet to when the response packet arrives is minimal; good for games\), and low jitter \(the variability in latency is low; good for VOIP\).
1.3.4. Pro: The capacity of ISPs is [limited by peering capacity and other infrastructural features](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/04/nbn-congestion-is-forcing-isps-to-build-their-own-private-networks/) that mean they do not have the ability to give all users their full theoretical bandwidth all the time.
1.3.4.1. Pro: "Net neutrality" may kill [peering agreements designed to speed up large bandwidth services](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/033015/what-you-should-know-about-net-neutrality.asp).
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Removing net neutrality is not an appropriate response for a particular business model failing to succeed or simply being expensive. Regulations should first serve the public interest, and then serve corporate interest. There is no indication that the major networks are hurting financially: Comcast posted [two billion in profits.](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/business/comcast-earns-2-billion-on-strength-in-cable-business.html) Quantitatively this argument doesn't have much evidence.
1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.1.2.
1.3.6. Con: Outside of bandwidth-intensive uses such as video most internet traffic doesn't consume significant amounts of bandwidth capacity. Without net neutrality companies can discriminate against services \(say WhatsApp\) that have a negligible effect on infrastructure loads.
1.3.7. Con: Excessive bandwidth usage by a minority of users is much less common in today's internet as online video has become widespread where it was previously a niche activity.
1.3.8. Con: If ISPs want to prevent certain customers from using excessive amounts of bandwidth they can set bandwidth caps; a technique that doesn't discriminate upon the kinds of traffic or content that users access.
1.3.9. Con: While this is the optimal scenario, we know that this is not what ISPs will actually do. They will charge money to put services in the "fast lane" and other websites will be slowed down. Moreover, this type of discrimination would favor big companies and could result in a less diverse online market.
1.3.9.1. Pro: The lack of Net Neutrality would allow ISPs to control access to content, and thus give them the power to discriminate in a way that creates anti-competitive effects.
1.3.9.1.1. Pro: ISPs would be allowed to charge companies for preferential treatment on their networks; a cost which is likely to favour established actors over smaller upstarts.
1.3.9.1.1.1. Pro: There is [evidence of ISPs throttling](https://technical.ly/philly/2014/05/09/graph-shows-netflix-speeds-changed-comcast-deal-comcast-roundup/) \(limiting access to services unless a company pays more\).
1.3.9.1.1.2. Pro: Net Neutrality is essential for innovation and competition because it blocks discriminating against smaller businesses and startups who can't pay what Internet behemoths would shell out for premium delivery of their assets to consumers.
1.3.9.1.2. Pro: ISPs are likely to favour services that are already established and popular, such as Facebook, Netflix, or WhatsApp. This would then entrench their position.
1.3.9.1.2.1. Pro: Social media platforms in particular already benefit strongly from network effects, making it difficult to break into or offer alternatives to the walled gardens of services such as Facebook.
1.3.9.1.2.1.1. Con: Prioritization or lack of prioritization at the ISP level has nothing to do with data lock in at the application level.  The cure does nothing for the disease.
1.3.9.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Prioritizing the services of already-dominant platforms can further entrench their position; making that particular disease worse.
1.3.9.1.2.2. Con: That's not what ISPs did prior to net neutrality rules. That was why companies like Facebook and Google were pushing for net neutrality: the discrimination that existed was in favor of high priority traffic that paid a premium \(video calls for example\) rather than in favour of the most popular services.
1.3.9.1.2.3. Pro: There is evidence in countries, such as Portugal or New Zealand, [of the internet being split into different packages](http://uk.businessinsider.com/net-neutrality-portugal-how-american-internet-could-look-fcc-2017-11?r=US&IR=T) which benefits the established services which can pay to be included.
1.3.9.1.2.4. Con: Technology and markets change faster than regulations, and all net neutrality will do is play favorites with existing large corporations like Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter while undermining the possibility of newer trends \(like how blogs and podcasts have been trends in the past\) to break ground.
1.3.9.1.2.4.1. Con: Net neutrality requires all content be treated equally. The current environment does not favour existing large corporations, their success favours them. Enabling ISPs to create and charge for fast lanes will be a cost that newer, smaller technologies, companies, and trends may be unable to absorb.
1.3.9.1.2.5. Pro: Net neutrality means it is easier for startups, because they have the same internet opportunities as large companies. With the option to pay to reach your customers further, new businesses with limited budgets will be unable to compete, therefore damaging the economy.
1.3.9.1.2.5.1. Con: Multiple factors affect content delivery speeds, and regulations can't ensure across-the-board equality. Start ups aren't as capable as large companies when dealing with bugs and software issues that affect content delivery, so in reality, they don't have the same internet opportunities as large companies.
1.3.9.1.2.5.2. Pro: Access to an open internet was what gave now-prominent gaming websites such as Twitch the ability to compete against oligarchic companies. Without net neutrality, it becomes unlikely that new content creators in the gaming industry will be able to compete, much less afford such services.
1.3.9.1.2.5.3. Con: This is already a problem in the status quo where companies can pay search engines to advertise their sites at the top of search results pages, so long as they highlight that they are advertised search results.
1.3.9.1.3. Pro: ISPs are likely to favour services that they own, or have commercial agreements with, over other services. This is an unfair abuse of their market position in one industry \(internet service provision\) to influence another \(media\).
1.3.9.1.3.1. Pro: Comcast, for example, could privilege traffic to it's own streaming TV service over that of Netflix, and in doing so secure an advantage for its subsidiary service.
1.3.9.1.3.2. Con: Existing antitrust law and regulations are sufficient to ensure that an ISP, like any other company, does not abuse monopolist positions.
1.3.9.1.3.2.1. Con: Antitrust law has never faced such power as an ISP and whatever conglomerate it could be a part of. Antitrust law must be enforced by bureaucrats and politicians who could be beholden to these market behemoths, and their lobbying, voter control, etc.
1.3.9.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Antitrust law [has been successfully used](https://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=6025) against Microsoft, Standard Oil, Kodak, and AT&T at times when those companies were in a position of market dominance and had incredible corporate resources.
1.3.9.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: In most/all of those cases, it was a multi-year struggle on the part of the government to deal the companies.
We now live in the 21st century with super-conglomerates and [big business rapidly growing bigger and bigger.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/big-business-is-getting-bigger/) If it was difficult enough for government to regulate big companies in the past 1.5 centuries, looking to the past for comfort/confidence against threats of big business dominance in the future is highly questionable.
1.3.9.1.3.2.2. Con: Antitrust law may not have a perfect success record. Thus, we could be putting our hopes in something which has not actually been very protective/effective. Without more evidence/support that antitrust law has been reliable even in normal situations in the past, it is irresponsible to put our hopes behind this tool.
1.3.9.1.3.3. Pro: Many ISPs have stakes in media properties that means there are plenty of incentives for them to privilege certain forms of  content over others.
1.3.9.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.3.9.1.5. Con: If anti-competitive effects are harmful to consumers that creates commercial incentives for ISPs to succeed by not discriminating against traffic.
1.3.9.1.5.1. Con: Eliminating Net Neutrality creates a catch-22 in this respect: if a service cannot get off the ground because it can't compete with incumbents hogging the fast lanes, not enough consumers will know about it or want it enough for it to be a selling point to an ISP whose distinct advantage is maintaining Net Neutrality. It is quite literally a case of "you don't know what you're missing".
1.3.9.1.6. Con: Discrimination is in itself not anti-competitive; it is only anti-competitive if it leads to excess market power or increases in consumer prices. If either occurs then [existing antitrust laws](https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/net-neutrality-shift-regulation-fcc-ftc/) can be used to ameliorate these effects.
1.3.9.1.6.1. Con: Antitrust laws are primarily [aimed](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/fcc-and-net-neutrality-way-forward) at curtailing monopolies, and won't adequately protect free speech online or prevent the harms to innovation that may occur in a world without net neutrality.
1.3.9.1.6.2. Con: Antitrust litigation is prohibitively [expensive](https://www.justice.gov/atr/strategic-abuse-antitrust-laws) for small startups, which would be most affected by a larger, wealthier ISP engaging in discriminatory practices.
1.3.9.1.6.3. Con: Current antitrust standards [protect](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/06/dont-trust-antitrust-law-protect-net-neutrality) companies from being accused of collusion with subsidiaries or parent companies. Given this, antitrust law is no replacement for net neutrality.
1.3.9.1.6.4. Pro: Antitrust regulations can provide a check on ISP overreach while allowing ISPs to provide data prioritization to customers and protect market competition. The Open Internet Order, in contrast, inhibits the ability for ISPs to provide potentially valuable services to those same customers.
1.3.9.1.7. Con: Discriminating against certain types of traffic can have pro-competitive effects as it can be used to lessen the influence of companies in monopoly or near-monopoly positions such as Google and Facebook.
1.3.9.1.7.1. Con: Various content providers, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, etc. would be incentivized/enabled to invest in the ISP market if major ISPs begin restricting content. Even the threat of such restrictions could motivate content providers to preemptively enter the market.
1.3.9.1.8. Con: 'Walled' gardens are often highly valuable to consumers, particularly with new technologies. For example AOL's forays into internet access provision benefitted from providing consumers with a highly curated service at a low cost in the 90s.
1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.1.
1.5. Con: -> See 1.3.9.1.
1.6. Con: Net Neutrality upholds the principles of free speech and open access that are the key values of the internet that help prevent censorship.
1.6.1. Pro: Access to internet should be regarded as a public right, not a private commodity controlled by oligarchical ISPs, because access to internet is essential to everyday modern life. Without Net Neutrality regulations, people would likely lose this right.
1.6.1.1. Pro: ISPs already charge people for speed.That's what we pay them for. What we watch, how we watch and how long we watch is none of their business. They are only the gatekeepers. If those business can't make money doing only that they should charge more.
1.6.1.2. Con: The internet is certainly essential to modern life. However, defining this as a 'right' might give the impression it should be free or affordable for every single person. Given our resources and economic system, this is not possible, though desirable.
1.6.1.3. Pro: Countless businesses rely on a freely accessible web to deliver their products and services, in much the same way we rely on freeways and functioning telephones. A web that is only partially accessible would harm our economy.
1.6.1.4. Con: It is highly questionable whether access to high-internet-usage services, such as Netflix, should be considered a "public right." Thus, "access to the 'internet'" is too broad of a claim for rights; most people should recognize that even if there is a baseline level of "access," it does not extend to the entire internet.
1.6.2. Pro: The Internet should be free \(as in free speech\), and the only practical way to keep it free is to treat every bit of the information transiting it — commercial or non-commercial — the same without regard to its content, author, buyer, or seller.
1.6.2.1. Con: Bits are already not treated equally. [Peering arrangements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering#Peering_agreement) between companies/ISPs/services or [content delivery networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) already provide distinct advantages to data provision for companies that can afford them.
1.6.2.2. Pro: Data, in its purest form, is just information and the internet facilitates communicating this information in the same way a public square facilitates publicly excising speech. To discriminate against data is thus analogous to violating people's rights to free speech.
1.6.2.2.1. Con: Even if sending or receiving data is a speech act then its transmission online depends upon the property rights of a private entity \(the ISPs\). In the same way that a company or individual has no obligation to guarantee or promote your freedom of speech on their  property, ISPs have no obligation to do so when you are using their service.
1.6.2.2.1.1. Con: Data is not a speech act. Speech act theory does not entail speech ownership — speech acts concern unstated implications rather than property of any kind.
1.6.2.2.2. Con: Net Neutrality is not about discriminating against the eventual arrival of data, it is about providers being able to prioritize data. To use your analogy it is like fire trucks being able to put on the siren and pass by taxis taking people to the public square.
1.6.2.2.3. Pro: Conveying speech at differing speeds is an implicit statement that the provider in question favors certain peoples' speech over others.
1.6.2.3. Con: ISPs, at least in the US, currently state that they have [no interest in violating the principles of net neutrality](http://www.verizon.com/about/news/where-we-stand-net-neutrality), but rather oppose the other rules that many forms of Net Neutrality regulation impose on their business.
1.6.2.3.1. Con: The FCC currently takes a 'light-touch' approach to [enforcing Title II provisions](https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/what-is-title-ii-net-neutrality-fcc/) that means the harms and appropriateness of particular regulations are weighed up if or when they are enforced.
1.6.2.3.2. Con: "Comcast deleted net neutrality pledge the same day FCC announced repeal" \([arstechnica.com](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/comcast-deleted-net-neutrality-pledge-the-same-day-fcc-announced-repeal/)\). It replaced statements like "Comcast won't throttle back the speeds at which content comes to you" with "We do not block, slow down, or discriminate against lawful content". The change from future to present tense is telling.
1.6.2.4. Pro: The internet should be a free medium, like the seas beyond territorial waters and space high above the earth's surface. Governments that serve their people avoid policies that close off free mediums because they serve a broader economic and civilizational goal to connect people to other people in productive ways.
1.6.2.4.1. Con: The seas beyond territorial waters and space high above the Earth's surface analogies don't work very well, because, unlike both of those, the Internet's network infrastructure is built and owned by humans, as is the content which is distributed using it.
1.6.2.5. Pro: Removing net neutrality harms free speech, because marginal voices that diverge from what is established could be de-prioritised just because fewer people listen to them. As an example, a person running a blog about politics might get slower traffic than a popular celebrity on Facebook.
1.6.2.5.1. Con: "De-prioritize" doesn't mean slowing something down deliberately. No blogger is going to get slowed to a crawl by any ISP. The at-risk sites are most likely going to be file-sharing sites that are actively engaged in pirated movie and sports streaming.
1.6.2.6. Con: Prominent content providers such as Facebook and Google overtly regulate their content. This is a much greater threat to freedom of speech than ISPs, considering that broadband providers have not attempted to impede access to content even prior to net neutrality.
1.6.2.6.1. Con: The fact that Facebook or Google overtly regulate their content does not diminish or dismiss the possibility that ISPs might do so also.
1.6.3. Pro: What you send and receive over the internet is in effect private property or private speech; companies such as ISPs are like phone line or postal services and should have no ability to violate privacy/property rights by interfering with data transmission.
1.6.3.1. Con: The nature of speech or property being public or private depends on the context in which it is transmitted. If ISPs are no longer bound by net neutrality and people still choose to use their services despite that change in context then they have forgone their rights to the private ownership of that speech.
1.6.4. Pro: Affording ISPs the power to discriminate against certain types of traffic or content affords them the power to censor the internet and set societal norms.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Certain types of political content — say information about communism — could be censored in an undemocratic fashion.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: The word "censored" is a very loaded term in this context, because it would simply be a case of "not helping to communicate." When a person chooses not to pass a physical note from one person to the next, they are not "censoring" that person from passing notes; they are simply not participating in the communication. In both cases \(physical notes and internet\), if the middleman \(you or ISPs\) did not exist, the people trying to communicate would not be truly worse off.
1.6.4.1.1.1. Con: This ignores the coercive nature/necessity of the digital age and online communication. While ISPs may not be "directly/explicitly" impeding someone, it can still be considered coercion. As an analogy: traditional censorship is digging where someone stands, putting them in a hole. However, ISPs now only need to pile up dirt around someone \(and not raise the person's platform\) to, in effect, "put them in a hole" \(i.e. censor them\).
1.6.4.1.1.1.1. Con: There is an important distinction between the action of hindering someone's access to information and the inaction of not assisting them to access that content.
1.6.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: In the digital age, information is assumed to be accessible online. Given this assumption, if ISPs block certain traffic this constitutes censorship as people do not even know what is being hidden from them.
1.6.4.1.2. Con: This type of "censorship" would create an economic incentive for other ISPs to provide the content; increasing competition.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Minority interests that are opposed by the wider public \(say gay pornography or information about drug use\) could be censored.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: In the status quo, content providers such as Facebook and Google routinely [censor minority opinions](https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-hate-speech-policies-censor-marginalized-users/).
1.6.4.2.1.1. Con: Conversely, FCC chairman Ajit Pai claims that there is [insufficient](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-pai-fcc-internet-regulation-20170426-story.html) evidence that companies engaged in such behavior before 2015.
1.6.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Before 2015, net neutrality violations, such as AT&T's [censorship](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/20201788/ns/technology_and_science-internet/t/att-censors-pearl-jam-then-says-oops/#.WnY1QpM-c1g) of a Pearl Jam broadcast, connectivity [restrictions](http://fortune.com/2009/04/03/group-asks-fcc-to-probe-iphone-skype-restrictions/) imposed by Apple on the Skype app on iPhone, and T-mobile's [use](https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/18/5822996/t-mobile-music-freedom-net-neutrality) of data caps to manipulate its customers' internet experience and curtail competition were common.
1.6.4.2.2. Pro: This extends to all kinds of controversial social issues. For example,[Verizon attempted to censor NARAL.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/27/business/27cnd-verizon.html?_r=0)
1.6.4.3. Con: Explicit censorship of content not justified in infrastructure effects is highly likely to be illegal due to constitutional protections surrounding free speech.
1.6.4.3.1. Con: [Constitutional protection](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/27/politics/first-amendment-explainer-trnd/index.html) to free speech applies to the government's actions in regards to individuals. It has very little bearing on how a private company operates.
1.6.4.3.1.1. Pro: The Supreme Court has ruled on similar free speech issues in cases such as [Lloyd Corp. v Tanner \(1972\)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/71-492), which found that ["an uninvited guest may \[not\] exercise general rights to free speech on property privately owned."](https://www.forbes.com/sites/washingtonbytes/2017/03/10/the-first-amendment-red-herring-in-the-net-neutrality-debate/#4ab162e5326a)
1.6.4.3.2. Con: Tech companies like Facebook, Paypal, and Spotify have [acted against](https://nypost.com/2017/08/19/so-just-how-guaranteed-is-your-freedom-of-speech-online/) extreme alt-right content and users without constitutional repercussions.
1.6.4.4. Pro: Allowing an ISP to control content allows them to censor any content that they do not agree with — for example, whistle-blowing content that exposes their malpractice. This could allow the ISP to deny its subscribers any content that might cause them to change their mind about their subscription or allow them to change their ISP.
1.6.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.6.4.1.2.
1.6.4.5. Con: It is against the competitive interests of ISPs to censor types of content, as consumers wishing to view that content will move to another ISP who does not discriminate against such content.
1.6.4.6. Pro: Net Neutrality is absolutely essential. A free exchange of ideas and information prevents government from limiting the rights of its citizens. If net neutrality is not maintained, a hypothetical oppressive government could use the ISP's to block, or slow down, any dissidents communication with the outside world or each other. Imagine you are an exiled political opponent of a government, and all they need to do to keep you quiet is to pay your ISP to do it.
1.6.5. Con: Allowing governments to create regulations that explicitly say how the internet should operate opens up opportunities for censorship and interference beyond the scope of just strictly enforcing Net Neutrality.
1.6.5.1. Pro: [Many national governments have abused their stewardship of the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_and_surveillance_by_country#Reporters_Without_Borders), when they have the ability to do so.
1.6.5.2. Pro: Because of past abuses, the [United States has already been rated an "enemy of the Internet" by  Reporters Without Borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_and_surveillance_by_country#Reporters_Without_Borders).
1.6.5.2.1. Con: That list is utterly absurd; it lumps the United States into the same category as North Korea, because the report uses an awful set of criteria, which appears to boil down to "can the government, in its current state, hypothetically suppress journalistic freedom?"
1.6.5.3. Con: If government's want to explicitly censor the internet they can do so directly \([as many authoritarian governments have](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12400319)\) rather than through Net Neutrality regulations that only very indirectly.
1.6.5.3.1. Con: That some governments have the unilateral ability to censor the internet directly does not undermine the potential risk that a less authoritarian government may attempt to do so indirectly via these methods.
1.6.5.4. Con: If anything, Net Neutrality laws actively obstruct governments from interfering with internet traffic because it makes it illegal for them to 'strong arm' ISPs into doing so for them.
1.6.5.5. Pro: Under Title II of the Communications Act 1934, the FCC may [prevent any action](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/436807/net-neutrality-government-control-your-internet-service) by any ISP it feels may “unreasonably disadvantage” an Internet user, application, or content provider.
1.6.5.5.1. Pro: Such [powers](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/436807/net-neutrality-government-control-your-internet-service) allow the FCC to regulate network upgrades, new products and business models.
1.6.5.5.1.1. Pro: Such a process grants larger ISPs, who can afford large legal teams, and lengthy court appeals, far greater power than smaller ISPs.
1.6.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.5.
1.6.6. Con: -> See 1.6.2.6.
1.7. Con: Governments are justified in regulating internet provision given it is a public good, a common infrastructure, and \(in many places\) a service that lacks consumer choice.
1.7.1. Pro: Most internet traffic goes over government-regulated property in some fashion or another. Bandwidth and transmission lines are owned by corporations with little ability to change ownership or open up competing mediums. Due to this, the government must regulate usage as they do with similar infrastructure.
1.7.1.1. Con: Price gauging of captive/inelastic customers has been rampant above actual costs of service. With all of the regulation, [not even Google could disrupt the existing regulatory construct](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/what-happened-to-google-fiber/).
1.7.2. Pro: Access to the internet is access to the general marketplace. As such, the ISP market is functionally different than other markets and needs to be treated differently to keep the general marketplace free and open.
1.7.2.1. Pro: We don't allow companies to put road blocks up in front of their brick and mortar competitors. Net Neutrality is how we prevent ISPs from doing this to their online competitors.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: This is an inapplicable analogy, because roads are owned by the government, and putting up "road blocks" is a violation of public property, and a restriction of liberty. ISPs, on the other hand, offer the service \("roads"\) themselves, in which case it is up to the consumer and/or content provider to negotiate with the ISP on how to most efficiently provide access.
1.7.2.2. Pro: A free market requires that no company control consumer access to competitors products.
1.7.2.2.1. Con: This is not a requirement of a free market, and/or even if it were, this does not truly describe the ISP market: rival ISPs can come in and provide access in a region if the customers are unhappy with the original ISP.
1.7.2.2.2. Con: This is a spurious argument at best as ISPs do not compete with content providers, they compete with each other.
1.7.2.3. Con: ISPs and telecommunications companies have no incentive to ban access to their pipelines: they make money based on how much content and how many consumers occupy their networks. Thus, concern about the internet not being "free and open" in the absence of regulation is misplaced.
1.7.3. Pro: The near-monopoly positions enjoyed by ISPs over local areas are largely the result of government regulation in the first place. Governments have a responsibility to ensure that they regulate the conditions they have created.
1.7.3.1. Con: The monopolistic competition is a natural economic result of the high cost of network build-outs for potential new entrants, especially in suburban and rural areas where a preponderance of detached, single-family homes causes last mile costs to be very high on a per-account basis. Government regulations are only involved to the extent that they shape local development and increase installation costs through policies like requiring permits.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: Broadband internet is a [natural monopoly](http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Business_economics/Natural_monopolies.html) in many markets, which is well-established grounds for close regulation to preserve access.
1.7.3.1.1.1. Con: [Natural monopolies are a myth](https://mises.org/library/myth-natural-monopoly) that allow government to control resources that could be managed through free markets.
1.7.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The Mises institute is generally not much more reliable than a random journalist when it comes to controversial claims: they are unflinchingly libertarian to the point of absurdity. Unlike academic journals which require peer review, and generally are encouraged to promote unbiased truth, the Mises Institute is wholly devoted to supporting its ideology over facts.
1.7.3.1.1.1.2. Con: The idea that there is no such thing as natural monopolies is an outright absurdity. One can easily point to examples such as roads or urban piping/wiring for water/electricity: in these situations, it is unreasonably costly to build multiple roads owned by different companies, or to build two, let alone three or more, systems of pipes or wiring.
1.7.3.1.1.2. Con: There are at least half a dozen new broadband technologies coming out that will disrupt the ISP market in the next couple of years.
1.7.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: [Google has launched gigabit wireless service.](https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/23/google-fiber-launches-its-first-wireless-gigabit-project/)
1.7.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: [SpaceX plans to offer multi-gigabit, low-latency Internet service by launching 4,425 micro-satellites into low-Earth orbits starting 2019.](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/spacex-plans-worldwide-satellite-internet-with-low-latency-gigabit-speed/)
1.7.3.1.1.2.3. Pro: [Facebook is testing high-altitude autonomous drones capable of flying for months that will allow 10 Gbps Internet over laser uplink.](https://www.wired.com/2016/07/facebooks-giant-internet-beaming-drone-finally-takes-flight/)
1.7.3.1.1.2.4. Pro: [Verizon will begin rolling out gigabit 5G LTE to homes in 2018.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2017/11/30/verizon-commits-to-significant-5g-residential-broadband-rollouts-in-2018/)
1.7.3.1.1.2.5. Pro: [AT&T is offering gigabit Internet service over power lines.](https://www.cnet.com/news/at-t-beaming-airgig-broadband-from-power-lines/)
1.7.3.1.1.2.6. Pro: [Starry and other companies are offering gigabit Internet service over new "millimeter length" or terahertz bands.](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601442/wireless-super-fast-internet-access-is-coming-to-your-home/)
1.7.3.2. Con: Allowing competition through free markets is better for consumers than to try to fix one government problem with more government red tape. Each government intrusion in markets causes more [distortions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketdistortion.asp) that ultimately harm consumers and aid monopolies and corrupt participants.
1.7.3.3. Con: Regulation is not necessary when [competition would resolve the concerns around net neutrality](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-13/forget-net-neutrality-what-americans-need-is-net-competition).
1.7.3.3.1. Con: Competition cannot resolve anything in the many many areas of the US where one ISP monopolizes all service availability. Killing net neutrality will not introduce new competition to these areas.
1.7.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.7.4. Con: Allowing ISPs to control content could increase investment in network infrastructure and encourage new entrants, thereby increasing competition in the ISP space.
1.7.4.1. Con: ISPs are the builders and managers of the physical network, which is mostly a natural monopoly activity \(they have a franchise zone with captive customers\). Viewed as a pipeline for entertainment they have no right to appropriate value of content creators.
1.7.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.9.1.7.1.
1.7.5. Con: Net neutrality laws do nothing to increase competition among ISPs, which [maintain "pseudo-monopolies"](http://www.businessinsider.com/internet-isps-competition-net-neutrality-ajit-pai-fcc-2017-4/#-2) of their own without having to increase infrastructure or compete with other service providers.
1.7.6. Con: [Government moves too slowly to effectively regulate the technology industry](https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/what-happened-to-the-microsoft-monopoly/), and [corrupt individuals in government often make deals with large companies](https://fee.org/articles/competition-monopoly-and-the-role-of-government/) leading to [government-protected monopolies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government-granted_monopoly).
1.7.6.1. Pro: Many new connection options are available now and more will come in the future unless regulations are put in place that restrict competition.  \(WiFi, Cellular, Cable, Fiber, etc.\)
[FaceBook Internet](https://www.wired.com/2016/07/facebooks-giant-internet-beaming-drone-finally-takes-flight/), [Regulation Stops ISPs](https://www.wired.com/2013/07/we-need-to-stop-focusing-on-just-cable-companies-and-blame-local-government-for-dismal-broadband-competition/), [ISP defined as criminally complicit](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2009/06/ftc-shuts-down-notorious-rogue-internet-service-provider-3fn)
1.7.7. Con: -> See 1.6.5.
1.7.8. Con: The internet is not a public good. Per [investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/public-good.asp), the internet is excludable and one person using it reduces availability to others.
1.7.8.1. Con: One person using the internet only reduces its availability to others at that instant rather than permanently. For example this is similar to how when a child is using a swing in a public park it makes that swing unavailable to a child in that instant but not permanently.
1.7.8.2. Pro: Since the internet is just a network of computers, it is possible to exclude someone from the internet by preventing them from accessing the network.
1.7.9. Pro: Broadband internet is a [natural monopoly](http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Business_economics/Natural_monopolies.html) in many markets, which is well-established grounds for close regulation to preserve access.
1.7.9.1. Con: -> See 1.7.3.1.1.2.
1.7.9.2. Con: [Natural monopolies are a myth](https://mises.org/library/myth-natural-monopoly) that allow government to control resources that could instead be managed through free markets.
1.7.9.2.1. Con: The Mises institute is generally not much more reliable than a random journalist when it comes to controversial claims: they are unflinchingly libertarian to the point of absurdity. Unlike academic journals which require peer review, and generally are encouraged to promote unbiased truth, the Mises Institute is wholly devoted to supporting its ideology over facts.
1.7.9.2.2. Con: The idea that there is no such thing as natural monopolies is an outright absurdity. One can easily point to examples such as roads or urban piping/wiring for water/electricity: in these situations, it is unreasonably costly to build multiple roads owned by different companies, or to build two, let alone three or more, systems of pipes or wiring.
1.7.9.3. Pro: For many consumers there are only one or two viable ISP choices due to "last mile" costs.
1.7.9.4. Pro: Even though there might be a plethora of ISPs nationwide, in many markets there are only a handful of ISPs to choose from, making them de facto monopolies, locally.
1.7.9.4.1. Con: After Net Neutrality is repealed infrastructure spending will increase and expansion cost will decrease, allowing more ISPs to branch into new locations, like a regular business would.
1.7.9.4.1.1. Con: If this were true we should have seen a decrease in investment in the past two years. We haven't. [According to the ISPs themselves, investment has increased.](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/title-ii-hasnt-hurt-network-investment-according-to-the-isps-themselves/)
1.7.9.4.1.1.1. Con: "Among our nation’s 12 largest Internet service providers, domestic broadband capital expenditures decreased by 5.6% percent, or $3.6 billion, between 2014 and 2016, the first two years of the Title II era. This decline is extremely unusual.  It is the first time that such investment has declined outside of a recession in the Internet era." – [FCC report](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-17-60A2.pdf)
1.7.9.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The methodology behind this study is questionable because it 1\) only focuses on the thirteen largest providers, and 2\) the report excludes counting of certain capital investments which are "recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles", according to [ARSTechnica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/title-ii-hasnt-hurt-network-investment-according-to-the-isps-themselves/).
1.7.9.4.1.1.1.2. Con: The cited "study" merely assumes/implies that the changes in capital investment/expenditures is due to the Net Neutrality when there are numerous conflicting factors \(potentially\) at play, including:
1\) The largest spender \(AT&T\) [had already announced](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/10/comcast-and-other-isps-boost-network-investment-despite-net-neutrality/) that it would scale back spending
2\) Broadband was [already reaching 94%](http://www.insidesources.com/economists-tell-lawmakers-net-neutrality-will-hurt-broadband-investment/) adoption across the US by 2015—which could reasonably be understood as a near-maximum. In other words, there's almost nobody left to lay lines for.
etc.
1.7.9.4.1.1.1.3. Con: Investment does not equate to benefit or expansion in competition, especially if the investment almost all goes to the largest companies: in such cases, it just means that monopolistic companies can get larger, rather than there arising more companies.
1.7.9.4.1.1.1.4. Con: This does not seem to mix well with the fact that ISPs' revenue grew strongly over the 2014-2016 period.
Specifically, their year over year revenue change in 2014 was 4.6%, whereas in 2016 it rose to 6.9%, according to IBISWorld. \(Report 51711d, May 2017. Accessed through university library database.\)
1.7.9.4.1.1.1.4.1. Con: ISPs have accordingly invested in other markets and acquired companies in sectors other than networking. Example: AT&T acquisition of DirecTV and soon to be Time Warner. Verizon acquisition of AOL and Yahoo. Sources: [Verizon Acquisitions](http://www.verizon.com/about/news-tag/mergers-acquisitions) ,[AT&T Acquisitions](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/at-t/acquisitions/acquisitions_list)
1.7.9.4.1.1.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.5.2.
1.7.9.4.1.1.2. Con: Qualcomm, Intel, IBM, and Cisco have come out saying net neutrality has had a notable negative impact on infrastructure spending, which all four of those companies provide. Source: [www.google.com](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2014/12/10/7370009/qualcomm-intel-and-others-speak-out-against-title-ii-net-neutrality)
1.7.9.4.2. Con: Many areas have limited access to new ISPs as a result of the high cost to entry. This is affected by many issues including government regulation. Reducing regulations to the bare minimum lowers the barriers to entry for new competitors, thus lowering costs for consumers.
1.7.9.5. Pro: For many people their ISP holds a monopoly, so there is no free market. Free market capitalism cannot be employed, as there is no choice for consumers, hence consumers should be protected by regulation from ISPs blocking/slowing certain content.
1.8. Con: Net Neutrality laws prevent ISPs from raising the price of internet access.
1.8.1. Pro: After the deregulation of radio companies, broadcasters [began controlling content and access to the platform for profit](http://www.futureofmusic.org/sites/default/files/FMCradiostudy.pdf).
1.8.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.8.3. Con: When Barack Obama made a statement in favour of issuing new net neutrality laws in 2014 [shares of traditional media companies \(e.g. Disney/Fox\) reacted better than those of new media companies \(e.g. Netflix/Hulu\)](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-11-21/the-end-of-net-neutrality-isn-t-the-end-of-the-world). This suggests that the absence of net neutrality doesn't allow ISPs to furtherprofit by discriminating against new media companies.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Even if shares don't react perfectly to new policies, the absence of a decisive shift in share value suggests that the impact of net neutrality is limited.
1.8.3.2. Pro: Share prices reflect changes to clear costs and benefits, such as when [the shares of companies that would benefit from tax reform rose after Trump's election](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2909835).
1.8.3.3. Pro: That passing Net Neutrality laws benefitted traditional media over new media suggests that the market thought ISPs would actually not discriminate much against new media — otherwise enforcing Net Neutrality laws should have been a large boon to companies such as Netflix that were otherwise at risk.
1.8.3.4. Con: Even the [article](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-25/i-ve-watched-trump-testify-under-oath-it-isn-t-pretty) notes that share prices fluctuate for a number of reasons. Share prices are unreliable indicators of policy outcomes.
1.8.4. Con: Even under monopolistic or near-monopolistic conditions prices have an upper limit determined by what the market can bear. Unless net neutrality provides higher value to users \(and thus raises the upper limit of what users will pay\) it is unlikely that companies will be able to charge higher prices because of the removal of net neutrality.
1.8.4.1. Con: The fact that "the total amount users will bear to pay..." will not change does not mean that prices will not change; monopolies allow companies to set prices, and in monopolistic conditions companies generally do raise prices. This increase in prices is generally socially inefficient/non-optimal.
1.8.4.1.1. Pro: [Even under monopolistic...](https://www.kialo.com/argument/5644.31) is correctly saying that aggregate demand \(AD\) will not shift. However, prices likely will still shift because the aggregate supply \(AS\) curve may shift or, as is the case for monopolistic conditions, the company can set whatever price it wants \(rather than being forced to sell at the price at the intersection between AD and AS\).
1.8.4.2. Pro: The lack of competition between ISPs in the US and other areas means that prices are already minimally influenced by competition and are instead set as according to the maximum that users are willing to pay for internet access at all. That is to say ISPs prices are [monopolistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_price) \(limited by demand\) rather than by marginal cost.
1.8.4.3. Pro: The presence or absence of net neutrality will not change the market power that most ISPs have over a geographic area. Thus it is unlikely to change the ability those ISPs already have to set prices.
1.8.5. Pro: By charging per-service ISPs can better extract profit from people who use a diverse range of services, as those users are more likely to be able to afford higher prices.
1.8.5.1. Pro: For example, users who subscribe to many streaming services are more likely to be able to afford higher prices for internet plans given they can already afford the costs of so many services.
1.8.5.2. Con: Charging some users higher prices also allows for other users to be charged lower prices however; meaning that internet access could be more affordable for the poor.
1.8.5.2.1. Con: De-regulation [decreases diversity of content and consolidates power](http://www.futureofmusic.org/sites/default/files/FMCradiostudy.pdf) in a few large companies.
1.8.5.2.2. Con: Internet packages are already price-tiered according to total speed.
1.8.5.2.3. Pro: The 'lower' limit of the cost of internet access is currently inflated because ISPs cannot ensure users don't access certain services that impose large costs \(say high-quality video streaming\). By blocking access to those services ISPs can lower prices to better capture new customers who otherwise could not afford internet access.
1.8.5.2.3.1. Con: Data is data. If that data is being transferred, the amount and speed at which the data is transmitted is what impacts the ISPs infrastructure; not whether the data is music or a picture of your aunt.
1.8.5.2.3.2. Con: This is handled by charging the specific end users based on the amount of data used, which is an option that ISPs retain under net neutrality. There are already low speed options in most areas which effectively accomplishes what is outlined here.
1.8.5.2.4. Pro: For instance, [Facebook Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Zero) allows millions of people the ability to access the internet for free. While it only allows for free access to Facebook services, that is still more choice than consumers would otherwise have had.
1.8.5.2.4.1. Pro: [Wikipedia](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Zero) and [Google](https://get.google.com/apptips/apps/?utm_source=googlemobile&utm_campaign=redirect#!/all) also offer similar services.
1.8.5.2.4.2. Con: In some cases, the \(usually wireless\) ISPs that sign on for these Zero plans are only treating them as temporary promotions. In other words: hook the customers on the content for free, then remove the free access, drawing the "addicted" customer into a new habit of access to the \(now non-free\) Facebook site.
1.8.5.2.4.3. Con: Facebook Zero \(and other such "Zero" programs\) subjectively advantage the Facebook brand and content in the free market of ideas.
1.8.5.2.5. Con: Just because ISPs charge higher prices to some users does not mean that they will lower prices for others in any way. It is more likely that ISPs will deliver the internet at whatever price the market bears.
1.8.6. Pro: Being able to leverage [price discrimination](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjhqczzvdvXAhWIHZQKHS3BCAUQFggsMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPrice_discrimination&usg=AOvVaw1qiUeP2ztM0O5gMupZXCsx) over different types of internet traffic allows ISPs to extract more profit \(by charging higher prices\) for the types of traffic that wealthier users tend to access.
1.8.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.5.2.
1.8.6.2. Con: Price discrimination also places some parts of the internet out of reach of the poorer internet users.
1.8.7. Pro: By charging per-service rather than charging on a content-neutral basis \(by tying cost to overall speed or data use\) ISPs can create more granular internet packages that exploit [price anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring) to justify users purchasing more expensive plans.
1.8.7.1. Con: -> See 1.8.5.2.
1.8.7.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.8.8. Pro: Without Net Neutrality, ISPs are free to exploit their position between customers and their chosen services \(Facebook, Netflix, Google, etc.\) to extract more and more money from each party to the detriment of Internet businesses as well as their customers.
1.8.8.1. Con: ISPs that do not offer the services people want will lose customers to ISPs that do.
1.8.8.1.1. Con: [The majority of people have no more than two choices for high speed internet, and about one third have only one choice for high speed internet or none at all.](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/50-million-us-homes-have-only-one-25mbps-internet-provider-or-none-at-all/)
1.8.8.1.2. Pro: Depending on where you live, it'll have a hard impact on the ISPs who start charging money/blocking certain services. Customers will choose other ISPs and they'll start losing more money than they originally had.
1.8.8.2. Pro: [MetroPCS tried to block all streaming except youtube.](https://www.wired.com/2011/01/metropcs-net-neutrality-challenge/)
1.8.8.2.1. Con: The few examples of network blocking and throttling abuse represent a handful cases in a market of thousands of service providers in the United States. In the vast majority of circumstances, these abuses do not occur.
1.8.8.2.1.1. Con: The infrequency of this problem doesn't provide any reason that Net Neutrality should be removed. It is still unfair, and this problem still needs to be regulated.
1.8.8.2.1.1.1. Con: There are "pigs" in every pen, both in corporations and politics. Giving the only entity that has the legal, monopoly power of force, government, control of the Internet is dangerous to its independence. The Internet was created and boomed without a fence- it is made up of individuals and companies voluntarily choosing to do business with each other.
1.8.8.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The fact that [ISP monopolies](https://www.wired.com/2013/07/we-need-to-stop-focusing-on-just-cable-companies-and-blame-local-government-for-dismal-broadband-competition/) exist in many localities is evidence of the harms of allowing government controls over the internet. Many local regions have too much control of which ISPs can operate in their region, raising entry barriers and decreasing competition and options for customers.
1.8.8.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In many states, ISPs have successfully lobbied for [laws](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160204/05121433515/states-wake-up-realize-att-lobbyists-have-been-writing-awful-protectionist-state-broadband-laws.shtml) which protect them from any competition and reinforce their regional monopoly on broadband services.
1.8.8.3. Pro: [Verizon](http://www.businessinsider.com/verizon-blocking-google-wallet-2011-12) impeded [Google Wallet](https://searchengineland.com/verizon-blocks-google-wallet-att-likely-to-do-the-same-103759) by refusing to install semi-standard NFC hardware in Verizon's phones.
1.8.8.3.1. Con: Verizon didn't block Google Wallet on the network. Verizon didn't include the hardware components \(NFC\) necessary to support Google Wallet on a particular phone. [Google later changed the Google Wallet hardware requirements so that they would operate on any device without NFC hardware](https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/google/123725-google-wallet-for-android-no-longer-requires-a-nfc-packing-handset).
1.8.8.3.1.1. Con: The fact that Verizon needlessly denied service/compatibility for another major companies' product is illustrative enough of the point that large companies can block each other's products to the detriment of competition. This was "needless" because, as the linked source in the parent claim notes, tens of other phones had this kind of technology.
1.8.8.4. Pro: When AT&T was Apple's exclusive cellular provider, [Skype calls on iPods and iPhones were not allowed to be made using AT&T's 3G data network](http://fortune.com/2009/04/03/group-asks-fcc-to-probe-iphone-skype-restrictions/).
1.8.8.4.1. Con: Apple blocking Skype calls has nothing to do with the "Net Neutrality" regulations. It is a device block, not a network block.
1.8.8.4.1.1. Con: As the article states, the device block only applied to cellular networks but not to WiFi connections. The iPhone \(at the time\) was exclusively available on AT&T who likely had commercial incentives to pressure Apple to disallow Skype calls in favour of its own services.
1.8.8.4.2. Con: AT&T soon removed the block, and they claim it was in response to [customer expectations](https://www.wired.com/2009/10/iphone-att-skype/), not the FCC.
1.8.8.5. Pro: [Telco was blocking VoIP calls](https://www.cnet.com/news/telco-agrees-to-stop-blocking-voip-calls/)
1.8.8.5.1. Con: -> See 1.8.8.2.1.
1.8.8.6. Pro: Comcast was [forging packets](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/10/eff-tests-agree-ap-comcast-forging-packets-to-interfere) to interfere with user traffic.
1.8.8.6.1. Con: This happened in 2007 and was most likely specifically interfering with illegal downloads of movie files which would have been against the customer's violation of the carriers' terms of use. This hasn't happened in the 10 years since.
1.8.8.7. Con: -> See 1.8.8.2.1.
1.8.8.8. Pro: [2012, FCC fines Verizon $1.25M for blocking tethering apps](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-tech/post/fcc-fines-verizon-125m-for-blocking-tethering-apps/2012/07/31/gJQAXjRLNX_blog.html?utm_term=.9f2b7e26737c)
