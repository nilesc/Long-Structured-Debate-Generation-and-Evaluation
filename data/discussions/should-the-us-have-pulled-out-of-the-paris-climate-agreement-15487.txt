Discussion Title: Should The US Have Pulled Out Of The Paris Climate Agreement?

1. The US should not have pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement
1.1. Con: It makes no significant impact. The Paris Climate Agreement is symbolic and unenforceable.
1.1.1. Con: In 2017 alone, around [70%](http://www.ren21.net/status-of-renewables/global-status-report/) of new power generation installed globally was renewable energy, with more solar PV capacity being added in 2017 than that of coal, gas and nuclear combined.
1.1.2. Pro: The Paris Climate Agreement is wholly unrealistic when you think of consumer economics. This will require that nations remove fuels that damage the atmosphere, but the cars most citizens can afford are exclusively the same cars that consume said fuel. It is both fiscally unrealistic and fiscally irresponsible for anyone to adhere to the demand.
1.1.2.1. Con: Car manufacturers will always want to make a profit. Now that they know that their product will be redundant in the years to come, they will put R&D into cleaner fuels and low emission cars, bringing the cost down.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The bloomberg [Electric Vehicle Outlook](https://about.bnef.com/electric-vehicle-outlook/) forecasts sales of electric vehicles \(EVs\) increasing from a record 1.1 million worldwide in 2017, to 11 million in 2025 and then surging to 30 million in 2030 as they become cheaper to make than internal combustion engine \(ICE\) cars. China will lead this transition, with sales there accounting for almost 50% of the global EV market in 2025.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: This is complete hearsay. You can forecast all you wish, but you will never be able to give everyone access to these cars. You cannot play favorites, and making them accessible to everyone is impossible.
1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: It is entirely possible to make electric cars as accessible as ICE cars are today.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Electric Vehicles are predicted to account for a rapidly growing percentage of all passenger vehicles [by 2025](https://about.bnef.com/electric-vehicle-outlook/#toc-download).  China is predicted 19%, Europe 14%, and the U.S. 11%.
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: All major car manufacturers are embracing electric vehicles \(see [Ford](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-autoshow-detroit-ford-motor/ford-plans-11-billion-investment-40-electrified-vehicles-by-2022-idUKKBN1F30YZ), [Nissan](http://fortune.com/2018/03/23/nissan-electric-vehicle-million/), [BMW](http://www.cityam.com/282715/bmw-pledges-gbp6m-research-and-development-electric-and)\), with 4 manufacturers declaring they [will go 100% Electric](https://mashable.com/2017/10/03/electric-car-development-plans-ford-gm/?europe=true#bb3u52Ipaiqu) \(GM, Volvo, Daimler \(Mercedes-Benz\), Jaguar Land Rover\).
1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: This is happening fast - Volvo will be producing [100% electric vehicles by 2019](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/07/05/volvo-becomes-first-major-car-manufacturer-go-electric/).
1.1.2.1.4. Con: Not everyone can afford even some of the cheapest electric cars. Even if you sold them for 3K, there are some who can't even afford anything cheap past 1K.
1.1.2.1.5. Con: Electricity functions as a different commodity than oil, generally, oil's a cheaper resource, and most likely easier to access.
1.1.2.1.5.1. Con: Oil is not necessarily easier to access, and is getting more and more scarce. Greener electricity generation is becoming more accessible and cheaper. Iceland generates pretty much all its energy through hydroelectric and geothermal technology, the U.K. generating more through wind than coal-fired and Germany generating up to 78% through solar technologies.
1.1.2.2. Con: Consumers only make choices on what is available and affordable. If burning fossil fuels became more expensive consumer spending would change; possibly by an increase in the use of public transport.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: More people using public transport could bring fares down.
1.1.2.3. Con: Agreements like Paris stimulate the drive to mass production by signaling trends and to some degree certainty to the auto industry. Mass production has in the past lowered unit costs; internal combustion cars were once unaffordable to most citizens too.
1.1.2.4. Con: Many countries are now banning new vehicles that run on fossil fuels like gasoline, diesel or liquefied petroleum gas.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, and the Netherlands have announced [plans to ban fossil fuel cars](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/04/23/will-electric-vehicles-take-world-just-green-really/) starting in 2030; Britain, France, Taiwan and California will ban them in 2040; and Norway in 2025. Paris, Rome, Madrid, Athens and Mexico City will ban diesel vehicles in 2025.
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: China, the world’s largest car market, will no longer approve any new fossil fuel car projects. A policy that goes into effect in 2019 requires automakers that manufacture or import over 30,000 vehicles a year to earn fuel-consumption credits and achieve quotas for producing zero and low-emission vehicles. China is also [working on its plan to ban fossil-fuel vehicles](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/04/23/will-electric-vehicles-take-world-just-green-really/) and will soon phase them out on the island of Hainan in a test run.
1.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: American and European automakers know they [have to sell cars in China](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/04/23/will-electric-vehicles-take-world-just-green-really/) in order to thrive, so Ford, Daimler and General Motors \(GM\) are all going electric.
1.1.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.
1.1.3. Con: Although it is not enforced through international law, it is enforceable through public support.
1.1.4. Con: Although partially symbolic, that does not remove from the fact that it is a huge gesture that demonstrates global attitudes to averting further damage from climate change.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The only thing Trump has achieved is to illustrate that climate change is not considered important to the US, which is unforgivably self-involved.
1.1.4.2. Con: A hollow gesture that would cost trillions of U.S. dollars is not the type of gesture we should be interested in.
1.1.5. Pro: Since the earliest stages, the Paris Climate Agreement has been criticised for its [unenforceable nature](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anderscorr/2016/12/01/expect-climate-catastrophe-paris-agreement-lacks-enforcement/#11942e033313).
1.1.6. Con: The Paris Agreement evolved from the similar Kyoto agreement, which succeeded.
1.1.6.1. Pro: The UN \(the organisation which created the Paris Agreement\) implemented the Montreal Protocol in 1987, [which successfully fixed](https://www.kialo.com/the-un-is-a-good-thing-15052/15052.0=15052.1+15052.149+15052.283) the hole in the Ozone layer, was extremely quick to debate, ratify, and implement, and has been considered the most successful international environmental agreement in all of history.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Targets for the 37 nations [were surpassed by 2.4 GtC02 per year](http://www.alphr.com/environment/1003699/climate-change-figures-show-kyoto-protocol-was-a-success-or-do-they).
1.1.7. Con: This is even more reason to not pull out, because there were only symbolic downsides to remaining.
1.1.8. Pro: [According to MIT](http://news.mit.edu/2016/how-much-difference-will-paris-agreement-make-0422), the Paris Climate Agreement would have not had any meaningful impact on climate change had all nations followed through with their suggested promises. "Meaningful" in this instance being my subjective interpretation of value for cost. It would have served only as a means for countries to proverbially pat themselves on the backs while costing taxpayers trillions of dollars.
1.1.8.1. Pro: The [study referenced](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2016/EGU2016-8016.pdf) predicts that if all nations keep their promises \(and no new targets are made after the existing ones finish in 2030\) at the end of the 2050 there will still be less than 0.1°C drop in temperatures.
1.1.8.2. Con: The [study referenced](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2016/EGU2016-8016.pdf) highlights that drops in greenhouse gas emissions take a long time to be reflected in global temperatures.

It says that by 2100, we would have reduced temperatures by 0.6 - 1.1 °C  \(depending on if we stop the targets at 2030, or if we continue them at the same level\).
1.1.8.3. Con: The Paris Agreement pledges, which only cover the years 2020-2030, are [expected to be reviewed and strengthened periodically](http://news.mit.edu/2016/how-much-difference-will-paris-agreement-make-0422), which would lead to an even stronger effect on the climate.
1.2. Pro: Leaving the Paris Accord will stifle innovation in the US green space as the rest of the world moves toward [sustainable alternatives](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/24/uk-power-generation-coal-free-gas-renewables-nuclear).
1.2.1. Pro: This decision also enables an increasing policy of [isolationism](https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/100000005701757/in-davos-trumps-isolationism-may-isolate-him.html) in a world where the global economy impacts daily life for everyone.
1.3. Pro: Pulling out has led to hostility towards the US and a renewed scepticism towards international cooperation.
1.3.1. Pro: The USA has a bad tradition of refusing international agreements. The USA often wants to be a world police that does not obey rules and regulations. This tradition makes the world a worse place to live in. See [www.quora.com](https://www.quora.com/Which-international-treaties-has-the-US-refused-to-sign-and-or-ratify).
1.3.2. Pro: Pulling out has made the USA the laughing stock of the world.
1.3.3. Pro: No the US is acting like a spoiled child who wants to get their own way. The climate does not recognise borders, so the US needs to put its own needs to the side and act in a way that suits the entire globe
1.3.4. Con: The US needs to act in its own interests first; international relationships are secondary.
1.3.4.1. Con: It's in the US's interests to keep good international relationships.
1.4. Pro: No. If you are not at the negotiating table then you get left out of the negotiation. Regardless about how you feel about Climate Change giving up that seat weakens our position.
1.5. Con: The Paris Agreement does not go far enough; the emission targets are not enforced.
1.5.1. Con: This can be amended or worked on. It shouldn't be sufficient justification to pull out altogether.
1.5.2. Con: If the Paris agreement doesn't go far enough, then it's up to the US to go further than that. Going backwards by pulling out of the agreement is counterproductive.
1.5.3. Con: It was still a step in the right direction.
1.5.4. Con: The previous Kyoto Agreement had enforced emission targets, [but the US did not ratify it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol#Non-ratification_by_the_US) either.

This shows that enforcement of targets is not the reason for the US not contributing to these agreements.
1.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.8.3.
1.6. Con: It has nothing to do with climate change. The world was greener millions of years ago when CO2 levels were higher. This agreement it about another tax levy on Western citizens - that's all.
1.6.1. Con: There is no evidence for the claim that the motivation for politicians to act on climate change is the desire to increase taxation.
1.6.2. Con: Whilst the world has had greater concentrations of CO2 many many years ago, the change was over a long period of time. The problem today is the rapid rate of change.
1.6.3. Con: All payments are voluntary. It is up to each country to decide how much to give. The US is able to remain a member without paying anything.
1.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.6.4. Pro: Carbon Dioxide levels [have regularly exceeded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere#Past_concentration) current levels.

Once at 7,000 parts per million, they are [currently \(mid-2017\)](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/) at 407 parts per million.
1.6.4.1. Con: One of the biggest problems is the rate of change, rather than just the level of atmospheric CO2.
1.6.4.2. Con: We are considering the effect of increasing CO2 on the planet and on current human society. Drastic changes in CO2 levels and an increased global temperature would lead to severe crop failure and a [food shortage.](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/research/title_649617_en.html)
1.6.4.3. Con: [Other factors were also at play making those C02 levels safe](https://www.skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=77), for example lower levels of sun activity.

Some of the High C02 periods coincided with Glaciation, not increased temperatures.  This shows that C02 levels alone are not enough to predict climate changes.
1.6.4.4. Con: We should look at [recent figures](https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/graphic-the-relentless-rise-of-carbon-dioxide/) instead of millenia ago, because we are in the "Anthropocene", a new geologic era where the climate is very different to the one our ancestors knew.
1.6.5. Con: "The world was greener" is both unevidenced and scientifically undefined.

Even if we had a clear definition of greenness, we cannot measure how green the world was across millions of years due to the [intermittent glaciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age).
1.7. Con: The agreement will hurt the economy.
1.7.1. Con: The top major tech companies \(incl Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Intel\) [wrote an open letter](https://www.c2es.org/content/business-support-for-the-paris-agreement/) saying remaining in the Paris Agreement was best for the economy.
1.7.2. Con: More than 100 companies, including IKEA, Mars Incorporated, PG&E, Salesforce, General Mills, Kellogg Company, HP, and Starbucks, [expressed their support](https://unfccc.int/news/100-major-companies-support-rapid-paris-agreement-implementation) for the Paris Agreement.
1.7.3. Pro: Reducing CO2 emissions will cost jobs.
1.7.3.1. Con: Green energy and climate change creates jobs.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: Will not create real jobs. Most of the jobs are taxpayer subsidised. Once the subsidies stop the renewable energy sector will have to stand on its own. We will then see how many real such jobs there are.
1.7.3.1.1.1. Pro: The UK cut subsidies for Solar Energy in 2016, and [more than half](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/10/uk-solar-power-industry-job-losses-government-subsidy-cuts-energy-policy) of the 35,000 jobs in UK solar industry were lost.
1.7.3.1.1.1.1. Con: However the U.K. has increased investment in wind energy, with the proportion of engery produced through wind turbines increasing every year. The UK is a cloudy, windy country, which is why investment is being put into wind rather than solar.
1.7.3.1.1.2. Con: The fossil fuel industry is also heavily subsidised. It received subsidies of [$5.3 trillion \(6.5% of global GDP\) in 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X16304867), which is [more than 4 times the subsidies that renewable energy receives](https://web.archive.org/web/20170509100441/https://www.auriumcapital.com/fossil-fuel-subsidies-vs-renewable-energy-subsidies).
1.7.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: As fossil fuels count for [80%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.COMM.FO.ZS?view=chart) of global consumption, fossil fuels produce 4 times the amount of energy of green energy. Therefore, the subsidies per unit of energy produced is the same for Fossil Fuels and Green Energy.
1.7.3.1.1.2.2. Con: As your link explains "As a rule of thumb, those subsidising renewable energy technologies tend to be richer OECD countries and those that subsidise fossil fuels tend to be non OECD countries, particularly large oil/gas producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia". This says it all. Be interesting to see a study that includes the tax \(opposite of a subsidy\) collected on oil products especially in OECD countries.
1.7.3.1.1.2.3. Con: Interesting to note that the failing socialist country Venezuela is ending fuel subsidies. [www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy/venezuela-gasoline-prices-should-rise-to-international-levels-maduro-idUSKBN1KZ01Z)
1.7.3.1.1.3. Pro: US [Renewable energy subsidies are $7.3 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_subsidies#United_States) compared to Fossil fuel subsidies of $3.2 billion.
1.7.3.1.2. Pro: The OECDs research suggests that ambitious climate change mitigation policies could [create more jobs and also more higher skilled jobs](http://www.oecd.org/employment/greeningjobsandskills.htm).
1.7.3.1.3. Pro: Today, there are more than [3.8 million “green energy jobs” available](https://www.fastcompany.com/3063560/the-business-case-to-mobilize-against-climate-change-jobs-and-innovation), following a 13% increase from 2013 to 2014.

If industries continue to mobilize around climate solutions, this number will only increase.
1.7.3.1.4. Pro: In renewable energy, the US solar industry is [creating jobs twenty times faster](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/12/how-will-climate-change-affect-jobs/) than the overall economy.
1.7.3.1.5. Pro: Energy jobs are already migrating to clean energy.
US [clean energy jobs outnumber fossil fuel jobs](https://thinkprogress.org/clean-energy-more-jobs-than-fossil-fuels-32f615915399/) by more than 2.5 to 1.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Drastic reduction of CO2 emissions would require minimizing production, and consumption, of animal products, impacting this sector's contribution to the US economy.
1.7.3.2.1. Pro: Animal agriculture is the [second largest contributor](https://climatenexus.org/climate-issues/food/animal-agricultures-impact-on-climate-change/) to human-made greenhouse gas emissions.
1.7.3.3. Pro: Partially cutting off CO2 emissions affects manufacturing industries, mainly those that involve fossil fuel processing. In particular, plastic products are ubiquitous in nearly every commercial US sector.
1.7.3.3.1. Con: The fossil fuel industry will eventually fail anyway because [fossil fuels are running out](https://www.business-standard.com/article/punditry/how-long-will-fossil-fuels-last-115092201397_1.html).
1.7.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.7.3.1.5.
1.7.3.4. Pro: Limited transportation of commercial goods across long distances will be needed to reduce CO2 emissions.
1.7.3.4.1. Con: Transportation will be possible using green energy, by using [electric vehicles like the Tesla Semi](https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/semi).
1.7.3.4.1.1. Pro: This will also be cheaper, with the Tesla Semi providing ["$200,000+ in fuel savings and a two-year payback period"](https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/semi).
1.7.3.5. Pro: Any job loss is preferable to a future series of catastrophes that results in the destruction of human civilization. Any short-term cost is acceptable if it means a greater long-term cost is avoided.
1.7.4. Con: The long term impact of climate change is expected to harm the economy far more than tougher environmental regulation would.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Any negative economic impact is preferable to a future series of catastrophes that results in the destruction of human civilization \(and by extension the economy\). Any short-term cost is acceptable if it means a greater long-term cost is avoided. This is the basic principle behind all forms of insurance, which is a short-term cost \(regular payments\) protecting against larger long-term costs \(accidents\). Reducing carbon emissions is essentially an insurance policy against future global disaster.
1.7.5. Con: A good economy will be useless when sea levels will rise out of control and the world will become two degrees hotter.
1.7.6. Con: [Almost all](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-paris-agreement-climate-change-oil-companies-shell-bp-exxon-urge-president-stay-in-a7745666.html) the major oil companies, including those in the US agreed with the Paris Climate Agreement.  On a purely financial level, the cost of climate change far outweighs the costs associated with meeting the agreement.  It also spurs innovation and new technology, which other countries will gladly step-in and accomplish.
1.8. Pro: It is very rare the entire world will agree on anything.
1.8.1. Con: That doesn't mean we shouldn't be trying hard to reach some form of compromise.
1.8.1.1. Pro: The US could have remained in and negotiated from within.
1.8.2. Pro: It could take indefinite amounts of time and money to achieve very little.
1.8.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.8.2.2. Con: The climate change agreement is designed to start combatting the very serious impacts of climate change, which is affecting the whole world; it is not 'very little' to achieve.
1.8.3. Con: The vast majority of countries \(170+\) have agreed on, signed, and ratified [68 international treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_treaties_by_number_of_parties#List_of_treaties_by_number_of_parties).
1.9. Pro: Reducing climate change is vital to our survival as a species.
1.9.1. Pro: It has now been made very obvious that the US is enforcing isolationism, at the cost of the planet; it is an unacceptable decision to have made.
1.9.2. Pro: The Paris Climate Agreement would result in a net benefit to human civilization in the long-run, even if there are short-run costs. This is the basic principle behind all forms of insurance, which is a short-term cost \(regular payments\) protecting against larger long-term costs \(accidents\). Reducing carbon emissions is essentially a worldwide insurance policy protecting humanity against future global disaster we know will come soon.
1.9.3. Pro: There is no other international way to address climate change.
1.9.4. Pro: -> See discussion #4540: Humans should act to fight climate change.
1.9.5. Con: Humans are tenacious, we'll adapt if we must.
1.9.5.1. Con: Humans are adapting, by creating the Paris agreement.
1.9.5.2. Con: If we don't start to seriously fight the climate change, the environmental consequences would be so harsh that we might end up [extinct as a species.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_extinction)
1.9.5.3. Con: True, but most humans would rather keep the planet healthy than have to adjust to a ruined one.
1.10. Con: Under the deal large amounts of money are being paid to other countries.
1.10.1. Con: It is questionable as to whether the redistributed funds would be effectively used by recipient countries, and so the accord if widely adopted could lead to significant waste, corruption, and a deadweight loss in utility in the global economy.[UN IPCC Official Questions Efficacy of Redistribution \(original from NZZ in German\)](https://www.nzz.ch/klimapolitik_verteilt_das_weltvermoegen_neu-1.8373227)
1.10.2. Con: Money is paid [voluntarily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement#Mitigation_provisions_and_carbon_markets) if a country doesn't decide to run projects at home to reduce CO2 emissions.
1.10.2.1. Pro: Money is only paid to projects that work to offset failures at home to reduce CO2 emissions.
1.10.3. Con: The [Green Climate Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Climate_Fund) was established before the Paris Climate Agreement in Berlin 2013.
1.11. Pro: It is only fair that the biggest polluters pay the most to offset the effects.
1.11.1. Con: Biggest contributor to global warming in the world is China at cca. 23%. USA is second at cca. 14%. [worldatlas.com](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/biggest-contributors-to-global-warming-in-the-world.html)
