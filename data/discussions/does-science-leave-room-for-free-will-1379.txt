Discussion Title: Does Science Leave Room for Free Will?

1. The scientific worldview has demonstrated the impossibility of free will.
1.1. Con: The existence of free will is compatible with science because science is skeptical on metaphysical issues such as whether or not 'free will' exists.
1.1.1. Pro: We do not have a complete picture of the causal mechanisms of human activity. Consequently, we cannot rule out in advance that a free will plays a role in shaping human activity.
1.1.1.1. Con: [Eliminative Materialism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/materialism-eliminative/) argues that we are warranted in eliminating recourse to metaphysical principles that don't fit in with the causal mechanisms of human activity as currently understood. Thus, we need not "leave open" a space for free will in later psychological accounts.
1.1.2. Pro: As they are generally understood, the principles of [scientific objectivity](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-objectivity/) exclude value judgements. The existence or lack of existence of free will depends on such a value judgement.
1.1.2.1. Con: Imagine a scientist builds a deterministic machine that perfectly predicts what a person thinks, says, and does. Would "scientific objectivity" prevent concluding free will is incorrect?
Whether or not such a machine can be built, this shows that objectivity does not itself exclude judgements of fact \(like whether free will exists\) with moral implications.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: The most interesting thing about such a machine is that it requires secrecy.  It the person learns about the prediction, they can simply choose to act otherwise and the prediction will fail.
1.1.3. Con: But science does require something like the principle of sufficient reason.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Assuming the [principle of sufficient reason is correct](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/), we are justified in excluding in principle internal/mental causation.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: From an angle, the principle of sufficient reason does fairly imply that there is some level of determinism in every decision an individual makes. However the complexity of one's inner context is far too large to determine anything in a binary way. Therefore, the determinism may lead to a probabilistic decision, rather than a direct causation, introducing some level of randomness, as seen in other phenomena in nature. That, I guess, could possibly be addressed as "internal causation"
1.1.3.2. Con: Even assuming the principle of sufficient reason, there are non-linear models of causation which leave room for the freedom of the will.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: There is some evidence for meeting the sufficient reason criteria with [non-linear methods](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chaos/#FreWilCon).
1.1.3.2.2. Con: Such methods seem to change the meaning of free will, making it indistinguishable from intuitive notions of freedom and the will.
1.1.3.3. Con: Science is based on [Falsificationism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#KarPop), meaning that until inferences about free will can be experimentally rejected, there will be room for free will.
1.1.4. Pro: According to one of the leading Theoretical Physicists Michio Kaku Physics ends the debate and Free Will does exist on a scientific level.  [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jint5kjoy6I&t=7s)
1.1.4.1. Con: Kaku does not say that free will exists on a scientific level. He says we cannot determine what will happen ahead of time, so some sort of free will exists.
1.1.4.2. Con: Kaku is wrong to say that because uncertainty exists, free will exists. Uncertainty shows the possibility of free will exists, not that free will actually exists.
1.1.5. Con: Science isn't a single viewpoint, and many conceptions of science do not need to be skeptical that they can address "metaphysical" issues.
1.1.6. Pro: You have the body \(seen\) and the soul \(unseen\). An urge or drive starts with chemical processes in the body but how that drive is quenched is decided by the soul.  Your body \(which you can hardly control\) is responsible for the hunger or appetite hormones but you are responsible for choosing junk over vegs. The scientific method only interrogates the seen \(body\) and it's yet to be upgraded to interrogate the unseen \(soul\).
1.1.6.1. Con: A mechanism by which a soul can have any physical effect on a body has not been discovered or even proposed.  Nor is there any evidence that such effects exist.
1.1.7. Pro: The scientific method is a system of testing a hypothesis through observation and measurements. Once data is found to support a hypothesis and that data is repeatable the hypothesis is accepted as a [scientific theory](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/scientific-theory), but is always subject to new data that may disprove the theory. As such certainty is impossible within science.
1.1.8. Pro: Since humans are rational beings, they are able to decide for themselves what they will do. Some choose to study quantum mechanics. Some choose to study art. Some choose to study the Bible. In this way, people demonstrate the operation of their own free will.
1.1.8.1. Con: Appealing to the a definition of rational actions that depends upon their being freely chosen to demonstrate free will is a circular argument. What needs to be proven is that rational deliberation is in the operation of a free \(in the sense of undetermined\) will.
1.1.8.1.1. Con: It's unclear why the burden of proof should be entirely on the proponent of free will.  When a person chooses to study quantum mechanics, it seems to that person that they could have chosen art instead.  But whatever they choose, the free will skeptic will insist that the choice was determined.  The question arises: is there anything a person could possibly do to convince the skeptic?
1.1.8.1.1.1. Con: The thread above does not attack free will on skeptical grounds. Rather, it makes a point about how logical argumentation works in the context of using the claim "Since humans are rational beings, they are able to decide for themselves what they will do" as a way of proving the existence of free will. Whatever standard of proof is decided on, such [circularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning) in argumentation is still a fallacy.
1.2. Con: The scientific world view has not succeeded in ruling out a [libertarian](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-theories/) conception of the free will.
1.2.1. Pro: The naturalistic scientific worldview is metaphysically incomplete.
1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.2.3. Con: The famous [Libet experiment](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/theres-no-such-thing-as-free-will/480750/) has proven that "the conscious experience of deciding to act, which we usually associate with free will, appears to be an add-on, a post hoc reconstruction of events that occurs after the brain has already set the act in motion."
1.2.3.1. Pro: There is agreement in the scientific community that the firing of neurons determines not just some/most, but all of our thoughts, hopes, memories, and dreams.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: Finding all the NCCs \(Neural Correlates of Consciousness\) is certainly neuroscience's aspiration. Yet, determined or otherwise, science can not account for how experience \("qualia"\)—including that of free choice—arises from these 100 billion switches.This "hard problem of consciousness" is precisely what AI is stuck with.[scholarpedia.org](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hard_problem_of_consciousness)
1.2.3.2. Con: The [results](https://aphilosopherstake.com/2012/08/10/neuroscience-and-free-will-new-study-debunks-libets-interpretation/) of the Libet experiment has been called into question.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: The Libet experiment mistakes [spontaneous brain activity](https://aphilosopherstake.com/2012/08/10/neuroscience-and-free-will-new-study-debunks-libets-interpretation/) for pre-action brain activity.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: Cognitive neuroscientist [Anil Seth](https://aphilosopherstake.com/2012/08/10/neuroscience-and-free-will-new-study-debunks-libets-interpretation/) argues that, “Showing that one aspect of the Libet experiment can be open to interpretation does not mean that all arguments against conscious free will need to be ejected.”
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Early brain waves can "...[actively intervene](https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/a-neuroscience-finding-on-free-will.html) in the decision-making process and interrupt a movement," which helps explain free will, rather than debunk it.
1.2.3.2.3. Pro: [French Neuroscientists](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/42/E2904.abstract) found that "the supposedly nonconscious preparatory brain activity identified by Libet is really just part of a fairly random ebb and flow of background neural activity, and that movements occur when this activity crosses a certain threshold."
1.2.3.2.3.1. Pro: The researchers deny that "[readiness potential](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/42/E2904.abstract)" is the final stage of planning to act.
1.2.3.2.4. Pro: "Libet would have arrived at a [different estimate](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2008/09/19/exposing-some-holes-in-libets-classic-free-will-study/) of when participants had made a decision to move if he’d used a visual or auditory control task to make his adjustment."
1.2.3.2.4.1. Con: The researchers claim that this [limitation](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2008/09/19/exposing-some-holes-in-libets-classic-free-will-study/) merely weakens Libet's results, but does not debunk them.
1.2.3.2.5. Pro: "The clock used by Libet featured a dot that circled the clock-face, rather like a second-hand. [Danquah’s team](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2008/09/19/exposing-some-holes-in-libets-classic-free-will-study/) showed that the speed at which the dot circled the clock face also affected participants’ time estimations – the faster the dot, the more accurate participants’ estimates became."
1.2.3.3. Con: Libet didn't endorse [free will skepticism](http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.5871/bacad/9780197264898.003.0003) on the basis of his results.
1.2.3.4. Con: The fact that someone's preceding mind disposition \(observed by brain imagery\) is strongly involved in his current decision does not preclude the ability of this person to have freely willed his main mind dispositions.
1.2.3.5. Con: The Libet experiment does not show that free will does not exist. It just shows that our temporal perception of the act of volition is post-hoc. But that does not mean that there is no volitional act.
1.2.3.6. Con: The Libet experiment doesn't appear to contradict free will. The remainder of the article shows what could be described as temptation, desire, or premonition. The fact that believing in free will is shown to make people behave more ethically seems to prove that, in fact, free will does exist. If you believe you have a choice, you can make that choice.
1.2.4. Pro: For science to prove a determistic universe and refute Free Will, the completion of a [Theory of Everything](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything) is needed. A Theory of Everything would be a set of laws that would model and relate all interactions of particles. Given a Theory of Everything is properly tested, if the state of all matter is known, the future state of all particles would be able to be determined. To be able to calculate the future state of all the universe with certainty would prove determinism.
1.2.4.1. Con: While such a theory would certainly be sufficient to refute free will it is not necessary to do so.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: The theory of everything is an attempt to reduce the four fundamental forces to just one. But even if this theory is unsuccessful, this does not give us any justification in positing any other forces other than the four fundamental forces.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: As this is a discussion on the possibility for Free Will left in science, and not a disscussion on the existence of free will, justification of another force outside of the fundamental four is not  required. All that is need is uncertainty in our modelling of the fundamental four forces.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The four fundamental forces are considered exhaustive. There is no need to reduce them to one force for this to be the case. Thus, there would need to be positive evidence of a different kind of force to require revision of our theory.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The existence of [Dark Energy and Dark Matter](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy) found due to the unexpected acceleration of the expansion of the universe suggests an unknown force called the Dark Force that is not modeled. The fundamental four are not exhaustive.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Even if dark energy proves to be a fundamentally different form of force than the four fundamental forces, we are only warranted in positing it after observing it. It is this observation, and not mere uncertainty, that warrants a revision of our assumptions.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This discussion does not require a proof for Free Will within science, but simply a proof of its possible existence.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Proof of the possibility of Free Will's existence would be any existence of uncertainty within the laws of physics.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Stochastic events don't lend support to the possibility of free will. A random event doesn't allow choices made independent of external forces in an otherwise deterministic universe.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: More recent [studies](https://www.sciencealert.com/bubbles-of-expanding-space-could-be-the-end-of-dark-energy) have called the existence of dark energy and dark matter into question. While this is far from established either way, the point is that we are nowhere near a revision of our current physical model.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: As more studies and evidence are found the room for Free Will, will diminish. Though until the complete removal of uncertainty within science, science will have not made Free Will an impossibility.
1.2.4.1.1.1.2. Con: Uncertainty or evidence in our current cosmological or physical model cannot be used as evidence for another propositional claim. That is an argument from ignorance. The null hypothesis applies until a casual connection is established. W.R.T. the burden of proof, it would be prudent to point out a problem with the wording of the question: Science cannot definitively rule out freewill \(can't prove a negative\), but this doesn't mean freewill is plausible or possible. The question needs to change.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: Explaining human action is not the same thing as explaining the motions of elementary particles.  It is thus unnecessary to refer to a complete causal picture of the whole universe in order to reject the idea that human action is rooted in free will.
1.2.4.1.2.1. Con: If humans and human action is comprised of elementary particles. With a complete understanding of how all matter interacts at the micro level then all macro interactions could be derivied.
1.2.4.1.2.1.1. Con: While an understanding of human behavior through reduction to elementary particles would be a sufficient explanation, it does not follow from that that it is necessary to have accomplished this to have any explanation at all. Thus, there is no reason to regard the incompleteness of reductionism as requiring skepticism about free will.
1.2.4.1.3. Con: For the primary claim to be proven the elimination of space for Free Will to exist must be complete. A proof of a deterministic universe would eliminate all room for Free Will's existence with this branch's definition of Free Will. This theory would prove a deterministic universe and is therefore necessary.
1.2.4.1.3.1. Con: To assert that reductionism is necessary to disprove a libertarian conception of the soul is to conflate determinism and reductionism. In fact, one can be a determinist and not a reductionist.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: There are versions of [physicalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/) which are deterministic but not reductionist.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Even if the universe is not deterministic every phenomenon, every thing, by definition of physicalism within the link, is physical. If everything is physical, everything is measurable and would have to be modeled within a complete Theory of Everything. Meaning, if Free Will existed, a Theory of Everything would have to include Free Will or more likely be unsolvable due to the nature of Free Will.
1.2.4.1.3.1.2. Con: The creation of a Theory of Everything is not to apply [reducationism](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/reductionism), in the form of reducing phenomenon to simplified basic mechanics . To complete a Theory of Everything is to fully define the interactions between all matter. To fully define the interactions is to simplify the interaction when possible, but define new mechanics when required.
1.2.4.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: The existence of [Dark Energy and Dark Matter](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy) found due to the unexpected acceleration of the expansion of the universe exemplifies the requirement for new physical mechanics would be need.
1.2.4.2. Pro: If Free Will doesn't exist then a Theory of Everything would be able to be developed and prove determinism, refuting a libertarian Free Will. If Free Will exists a Theory of Everything would have to incorporate Free Will as a force or become impossible to create due to the nature of Free Will. Either way a complete Theory of Everything  proving determinism would be needed to refute and remove all possibility of Free Will's existence
1.2.4.3. Pro: Quantum Mechanics, in particular the [Heisenberg Principle](https://www.britannica.com/science/uncertainty-principle), denies the possibility of a deterministic universe. Specifically through Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle there is no way to possibly measure without uncertainty the position and velocity of an object. The smaller, less massive, object being measured the greater the uncertainty.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: The rejection of determinism does not imply the existence of free will but simply the impossibility of fully modeling causality.
1.2.4.3.2. Con: Many would argue that by measuring a particle, we interact with it, thereby change its position or speed. When we interact with a particle we change its position or speed, thereby causing uncertainty. Therefore the Heisenberg Principle may not be a argument for a non-deterministic universe.
1.2.5. Pro: Only when science can validate by observable methods a 100% accuracy rate on determined events can the claim be true. Therefore the claim is currently untested and invalid.
1.2.6. Pro: The Leibniz's metaphisical doctrine demands the hypothesis of "Free Will". For instance, should be useful explaining such hypothesis: it is about asserting that there is a rational soul also entails asserting that the soul is free to pursue rational aims. If someone says "every one has a rational soul", therefore he must argue "such soul is free to go after whatever Reason wants for". \[thanks for outis to help me on editing the wording\]
1.3. Con: Using a [compatibilitist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/) definition of free will, the existence of free will is compatible with a naturalistic/scientific worldview.
1.3.1. Pro: Many philosophers define [free will in terms of moral autonomy and responsibility](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/#FreWil). Free will, thus defined, is entirely compatible with even deterministic science.
1.3.1.1. Con: Assuming that there is an absolute [freedom](http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/problem/) of human action \(and choice\) it requires the randomness of absolute unpredictability, but if the individual's actions are the direct consequence of a random event, it cannot feel responsible for it.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Moral responsibility is evidence of free will.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: If there were no free will, it would make no sense to assign blame to individuals for what they did, as there is no meaningful sense that they could have done otherwise.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: We do assign blame and praise to others.
1.3.1.2.3. Con: But we may be wrong to assign moral responsibility in this way. That is, this may simply show that we believe in something unreal.
1.3.1.2.4. Con: One could continue to apply praise or blame on strictly behavioristic or utilitarian grounds without believing in a deep sense of moral responsibility.
1.3.1.3. Con: A scientific worldview cannot accept moral responsibility because the concept of moral responsibility assumes that an agent with free will is removed from external causes.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: Even in a strictly deterministic framework, [we can say certain person's actions could have been done otherwise](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1397051?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). Thus, the notion of moral responsibility is compatible with a scientific worldview.
1.3.1.3.1.1. Con: The mere assumption of moral responsibility should not be accepted by a scientific worldview, even if the two are metaphysically compatible.
1.3.1.3.1.2. Con: This relies on a much weaker account of free will than many free will proponents are willing to accept.
1.3.1.3.1.3. Pro: Counter-factual claims are metaphysically defensible.
1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.
1.3.3. Con: Philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche have argued that the conception of moral autonomy and responsibility that belief in free will entails presents a distorted picture of human psychology.
1.3.4. Con: Compatibilism is defining free will in a far more narrow way than what is useful. According to compatibilism "free will is freedom to act according to one's motives without arbitrary hindrance from other individuals or institutions". This forgets that the motives a person carries are not under their control, and are defined by their genetics, upbringing, environment and life experience.
1.4. Pro: Naturalism and the scientific worldview necessitate a deterministic worldview and by extension the rejection of free will.
1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.4.2. Pro: Science is about investigating and defining the world and nothing can be free from the realm of science whereas 'free will' cannot even be coherently defined.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Science is not a static framework of knowledge, but a method of ascertaining more and more reasonable explanations to explain those things we observe in the world.
1.4.2.2. Pro: The term 'free will' is poorly defined and pretty much unfalsifiable, thus the existence of free will cannot be tested scientifically.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: More precise definitions of free will are possible.
1.4.2.3. Con: The definition of free will can be coherently defined as ["the ability to choose how to act"](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/free%20will).
1.4.3. Pro: According to [behaviorism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/behaviorism/), any action can be explained according to the external factors of punishment and reward.
1.4.3.1. Con: Logical Behaviorists such as Ryle and Wittgenstein, argue that while free will is a problematic concept, the best means of studying human behavior is not through the scientific method, but through [a philosophical analysis of the language and concepts we employ in everyday life.](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ryle/#OrdLan)
1.4.4. Pro: Newer [biological findings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will#Scientific_approaches) come to the conclusion that humans are determined by their genes, as well as environmental factors.
1.4.5. Pro: The concept of causation assumed in order to formulate scientific laws excludes free will.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Many [free-will philosophers](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/#3.2) claim that the realm of individual action is divorced from external causation. Because science relies on such a concept of causation to explain the world, it excludes free will.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.4.5.1.2. Con: While the scientific method may exclude discussion of internal mental causation and therefore lead to skepticism about free will, it cannot rule out the existence of free will.
1.4.5.2. Con: While scientific laws are crucial for many scientific disciplines, it is unclear whether all scientific disciplines must utilize such laws. It may very well be the case that we can describe human psychology, for example, according to a looser definition of causation.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.
1.4.5.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.
1.4.6. Pro: The operation of science depends upon the universality of the idea of causality \(that every observable phenomenon is determined by a prior cause\). This idea is not compatible with the idea of free will understood as an unconstrained, undetermined or purely spontaneous act.
1.4.6.1. Con: Few advocates of free will would define free will in such terms, like it is some kind of ghost in the machine.
1.4.6.2. Con: -> See 1.4.5.2.
1.4.7. Con: While earlier scientific perceptions like the classical mechanics \([Newtonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics)\) regarded the universe as strictly deterministic, newer approaches like the [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will#Physics) do leave room for free will as the theory is only able to predict events in terms of probabilities.
1.4.7.1. Con: Quantum mechanics does not help the argument for free will because randomness isn't the same as freedom of will.
1.4.7.1.1. Pro: Probabilities are a way of predicting a random result. Imagine a small spinner on a circle that is 80% red and 20% blue. In quantum mechanics the spinner acts at random, but has an 80% chance of landing red and 20% chance of landing blue, based on probability distribution, yet the result is still at random.
1.4.7.1.2. Con: Randomness simply means that science can not predict a result deterministically. This leaves open the possibility that the result is determined by free will, which science cannot currently explain. Randomness does not have to equate to free will to allow the possibility of free will.
1.4.7.1.2.1. Con: Either a human action is caused/necessitated \(determined\), or uncaused/unnecessitated \(random\).
1.4.7.1.2.1.1. Con: A thing can be a cause of an effect in an unnecessary \(i.e. contingent\) way.
1.4.7.2. Pro: Whether or not a small particle such as a quark swerves in a particular direction at a particular time is described properly only by probabilistic equations. Although the equations may predict the likelihood that a quark swerves to the left at a certain time, whether or not it actually swerves is indeterministic or random.
1.4.7.2.1. Con: Even if micro-particles such as quarks are indeterministic, it might be that larger physical objects such as humans are deterministic.
1.4.7.3. Con: There are deterministic interpretations of Quantum Theory, such as the [Many-Worlds Interpretation](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/).
1.4.7.4. Pro: The same is arguably also true even of thermodynamics, which is also based more on probabilistic than mechanically deterministic models.
1.4.8. Con: Despite many scientists citing experiments, [empirical evidence disproving free will is lacking or overstated](http://www.creativitypost.com/science/has_neuro_science_buried_free_will).
1.4.9. Con: Science does not take a stance on whether or not 'free will' exists. Whether or not it exists is pretty much the realm of philosophy.
1.4.10. Con: That all things are caused does not exclude that things can cause things to cause. 

I.e. our minds are caused by how our neural systems are organized. That does not mean that are minds lack causal powers to act in the world.
1.4.10.1. Con: The neural system causes the mind, the mind causes the actions. We can then say that the neural system causes the actions. The mind is merely a figurative link between both.
1.4.11. Con: Free will is not opposed to determinism. Free will = freedom + will. Freedom is the absence of external coercion and will is internal motivation.
1.4.11.1. Con: Free will is the act of which a determination makes a choice that is not predermined. Therfore one can be not free but still have free will. Example: Slavery.
1.4.12. Pro: The concept of causation assumed in order to formulate scientific laws excludes free will.
1.4.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.1.
1.4.12.2. Con: -> See 1.4.5.2.
1.4.12.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.
1.4.12.4. Pro: Any conscious decision or act that one might consider proof of free will, will be every time preceded by a number of subconscious processes, genetics, randomness and other environmental factors, none of which the person has any control over.
1.4.12.5. Pro: The discipline of neuroscience aims to explain the causes behind our brain decisions. Our will is one of those decisions, and as long as it has causes, it is not free.
1.4.12.6. Con: Causation only applies in the material sphere. Ideas and thoughts are related by reasons that, being of mental disposition, are not nearly so tightly bound as the balls on the billiard table.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Fourfold_Root_of_the_Principle_of_Sufficient_Reason)
1.4.13. Con: Humans might not possess free will due to their mechanical state, but that doesn't mean it cannot exist outside of human consciousness and awareness by some other organism or entity.
1.4.13.1. Con: If physical laws govern that organism or entity, it can not by definition, have free will. Even if the laws of physics are the only governing force, that organism or entity cannot choose freely beyond the constraints of those physical laws. Even concepts that seemingly don’t have governing forces, like time, are interdependent on other physical laws which prohibits the individuality required for free will.
1.4.13.1.1. Con: If physical laws govern themselves, this proves the existence of free will in physical laws.
1.4.14. Con: Scientific experiments at the quantum level show there is nothing deterministic about reality.  At the large scale that humans can observe the statistics of large numbers give the illusion of it.  That is why it was a long time before Newtonian "classical" mechanics were found to be inadequate.
1.4.15. Con: [Deterministic chaos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#Complexity_and_chaos_theory) implies complex systems \(like human beings\) are unpredictable in practice, which leaves room to free will under strictly deterministic laws of nature
1.5. Pro: There are more assumptions made in arguments for Free Will \(Requirement for a soul, requirement for humans to not be affected by determinism like the rest of the universe, etc\) than there are assumptions made arguing against Free Will.  Occam's Razor: Free Will doesn't exist.
1.5.1. Con: If there were infinite assumptions for Free Will and only 1 assumption against Free will, that still leaves a possibility for free will. Any assumption against free will leave room for free will to exist. This claim argues for the likelihood of free will, not the possibility.
1.5.1.1. Con: Science relies heavily on Occam's Razor when deciding between competing hypotheses.  Since the topic is on the scientific standing of free will and not a general question on the existence of free will Occam's Razor can decide the dominant scientific hypothesis.
1.5.2. Con: Free will, defined as the liberty of the human beings to do as they please, don't require a soul.Existentialism is grounded in free will, named as "radical liberty", and don't accept the existence of a god or souls.
1.5.2.1. Con: Free will doesn't have a universally accepted definition.
1.5.2.2. Con: Free will still requires humans to be unaffected by a deterministic universe, since determinism implies every effect is necessitated by a specific cause or causal series.
1.5.3. Pro: The primary assumption made on behalf of free will is that the universe is deterministic, yet humans are not affected by the determinism of the universe.
1.5.4. Con: The argument that free will doesn't exists assumes that every single human beings lived experience is totally false. This is a much bigger assumption than any made on the side of free will
1.5.4.1. Con: Since all life is evolutionarily related, one does not need to assume a false experience of reality applying to every single human, but simply for the shared biology of the brain. 
And there are many other examples of delusionary brains.
1.5.4.2. Con: There are many examples of people with a false experience of reality.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: Hallucinations, tinnitus and phantom-sensations and -smells are all examples of false experiences of reality.
1.5.4.2.2. Pro: Perception of time changes with what mood one is in or if one focusing attention on a task.
1.5.4.3. Pro: This argument applies as well to a less controversial aspect of lived experience: subjectivity.  Science has no noncontroversial explanation for my subjective experience in general, let alone my subjective experience of being free.
1.5.5. Con: Just because there are more assumptions made on any given argument does not mean it is closer or further from an available truth.
1.5.5.1. Con: Arguments aren't immediately related to truth - they are related to validity, that is the connection between the premises and assumptions and what is being proven. And insofar as it is necessary to show that those assumptions are true in order to show that a valid argument necessarily leads to a true conclusion, the burden of proof in an argument that relies on extra assumptions will always be greater.
1.5.5.2. Pro: The goal of an argument is to ascertain the truth of a situation.
1.5.6. Con: No need for a soul, just some matter that can make nondeterministic decisions by itself - random to the outside observers. The universe is only deterministic at big scales governed by classical physics. The small parts of everything are governed by quantum physics, which is probabilistic and random like free will. The evolution has been utilizing quantum mechanics for everything and the brain is made of synapses so tiny, it's very possible brains can do something with this quantum randomness.
1.6. Con: Free will lets us override our involuntary reactions that evolved for efficiency.
1.6.1. Pro: Accumulated evolutionary evidence so far, suggests that allowing the evaluation of possible future scenarios and acting on their foreseeable consequences dramatically improved our chances to consciously modulate our behavior. Thus even if free will is an illusion to oneself, the organism generating and operating such an illusion exercises acts of choice between simulated scenarios that affect both itself and the world around it.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Cognitive/behavioral scientists have focused on the primate and human [prefrontal cortices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex) of the brain and found out it allows them, at least: 1\) not to constantly yield to impulses/instincts -tantamount to the absence of free will. 2\)[work on alternate plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory#Localization_in_the_brain) before acting. Of course, these two show mutual influences
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Developing plans and not acting on instincts does not demonstrate free will. One can do so in a compulsory manner; those plans and decisions are dictated by our genes and experience and so our will isn't free.
1.6.1.1.2. Con: Acting on plans is in no way tantamount to acting with free will.
1.6.1.2. Con: That humans make decisions contrary to their instincts only supports the proposition that humans have will, not that we have free will.
1.6.2. Con: Voluntary action does not a free will make.
1.7. Con: Quantum Mechanics supports the existence of free will.
1.7.1. Pro: Because there is a causal discontinuity in nature at the quantum level i.e. events at the quantum level of reality have no physical cause, synaptic events in the brain \(which are subject to quantum indeterminacy\) give rise to causal uncertainty at the level of the whole brain. It then follows that human will is not fully causally determined in the physical world.
1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.
1.7.3. Con: Quantum Mechanics poses a serious challenge to certain deterministic models in terms of matter and energy but it does nothing to support the notion that persons invent their own experience or are somehow free to act against the mandates of nature.
1.7.4. Con: At best this supports the idea of randomness of behavior. But typically "free will" is meant to mean much more than that, and specifically to have a moral aspect such that praiseworthiness or blameworthiness may be assigned to a being depending on its free will decisions. Quantum mechanical randomness does nothing to support this.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Quantum randomness doesn't change the balance of free will in either direction. You can have a deterministic world with a random component in it - or not - but in either case you as the person who is supposed to have free will is not in charge of that randomness.
1.7.5. Con: Einstein's theory of Special Relativity requires that the past, present, and future have equal existence.  Future events for one observer are present or past events for other observers.
1.7.6. Pro: Quantum mechanics is not mechanical randomness as some have suggested but a state of potential where all possibilities are co-present simultaneously before a 'choice' is made that collapses the fuzzball. To be conscious enough to make an actual choice beyond a biological response requires parallel computing in orthogonal time which can be aware of all potential states.
1.7.7. Con: The physics of our universe is deterministic on the macro scale \(see: orbital mechanics, Newtonian motion, etc.\). This macro scale behavior ultimately arises from probabilistic quantum scale behavior. For consciousness to impose free-will, there must be a mechanism by which we can, by thinking, affect probabilistic quantum mechanical behavior. We know of no such mechanism, and have no evidence to suggest its existence.
1.7.8. Pro: Quantum Theory suggests that atoms in the brain can travel through more than one neural pathway at a time, in a superposition [bbc.com](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170215-the-strange-link-between-the-human-mind-and-quantum-physics). Therefore why is the final measurement \(conscious decision\) chosen? Quantum theory disproves determinism therefore free will may exist.
1.8. Con: The ability to create art proves the existence of free will.
1.8.1. Pro: All animal behavior exists for the survival of the species. The ability for humans to do something that does not contribute to humanity’s survival whatsoever, such as creating and enjoying works of art, indicates that there is an aspect of our psyche that is free to do anything it wants, regardless of the action’s usefulness.
1.8.2. Con: Some AI algorithms can arguably create art - [Deep Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream) or [Deep Art](https://deepart.io/) for example.
1.8.3. Con: Some fish and birds create what could be considered art, except that study suggests that they are rituals and creations designed to attract mates.  Some human art is clearly done for the same reason.  Also, it is certainly possible that we are not far enough removed from our species to see what is, perhaps, a bland, biological purpose \(or need\) for creating art.
1.8.4. Con: Even creativity is a function of someone's particular brain. Regardless of how useful a brain function is for our species' survival, the fact remains that the atoms which produce it are obeying the laws of physics. Since we have no conceivable way of warping the laws of physics with our sheer thoughts, and the parts of our brains which produce art are governed by these laws, any agency humans have in the creation of art is purely an illusion.
1.8.5. Con: This argument seems to be circular, depending on art being defined as "a thing that can only be generated by free will".
1.8.6. Pro: Art is the greatest human freedom.
1.9. Pro: Scientific and serious research done by Behaviour Analysis confirms that we respond to the world, thus proving that [free will doesn't exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Freedom_and_Dignity#Punishment) .
1.9.1. Pro: Our capacity for creativity, intentionality, "agency", etc. can be explained more parsimoniously via emergent "degrees of freedom" rather than "freewill". A degree of freedom doesn't enable you to do differently than you did in the past, but indicates the discovery of or potential access to a "novel option" which can be deployed when faced with a similar situation in the future. This is how we actually cultivate our capacity to respond \(and can learn to be more responsible / response-able\).
1.9.2. Con: In an essay, Indian thinker Ashish Dalela, while not directly stating that free will exists, invoking the Axiom of Choice in mathematics, makes the argument that if we want to be rational, we have to accept free will as a unique, fundamental and irreducible concept. 

The essay's conclusion is that once
we reduce free will to an ordered set of number we reach a decision: how to order the unordered set? The method for doing that must itself be chosen.

[Do we have free will?](https://www.ashishdalela.com/2015/11/12/do-we-have-free-will/)
1.9.3. Con: Science recognizes that living organisms are self-organised things that are not just affected by other things but act upon the world according to internally generated goals. So even the simplest cell has in a limited sense "free will". Our minds can, because of the complex ways our neural systems are organized, exert more complex forms of causal agency.
1.9.3.1. Con: Even with the consideration of neural plasticity, total free will can not exist within the constructs of the human mind due to governing neurological networks and their vast web of intertwining, interdependent physical connections between both internal and external networks. An example would be, you can choose to alter the mental response of a stimulus, like to alter your tolerance to coldness, but you cannot freely choose to alter physical response to a stimulus, your body will be cold.
1.9.3.1.1. Con: The lack of "total free will" does not rule out the possibility of free will to lesser degrees. Different entities could possess different levels of free will based on the amount of actions possible in their environment.
1.9.3.2. Con: The argument above, is simply stating that organisms have potential to act in different ways and to different degrees of complexity, but complexity does not give rise to the freedom of will. One can imagine a computer running a neural network algorithm. This network, no matter how complex and life like, will never be able to exert its own will or behave against its programming \(even if it is programmed to behave randomly\). The same holds for brains, which are only more complex.
1.9.4. Con: Responding to the world could also be the agent of a free will. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Evolves) [2](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2014/05/cognitive-science-and-threats-to-free-will/)
1.9.5. Con: Scientific studies of behaviour which do not allow for free will to express itself should not be counted as evidence as the subject itself is not being studied. This would include control groups, stimulus response etc... The reasoning is free will needs choice and understanding of choice in order for it to exist.
1.9.5.1. Con: A response is a choice, an unconscious choice.
1.9.5.2. Pro: Without conscious choice, free will cannot exist.
1.9.5.2.1. Con: Studies show unconscious decision making before voluntary action. [rd.springer.com](https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-0355-1_16)
1.9.5.2.2. Con: By definition will does not denote a conscious choice. For example: The statement, 'I will wake up tomorrow' for example, while being true as an observation, waking as an act is subconscious.
1.9.5.2.3. Con: Free will is an illusion: "Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason, that men believe themselves free, simply because they are conscious of their actions, and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined." Baruch Spinoza, Ethics
1.9.6. Pro: It is practically impossible to separate the sense of “free choice” or “free will” from the countless influences on both sides—environment vs. body/mind. As quantum mechanics and medicine \(placebo research\) claim—even observing IS influence.
1.10. Con: The neuroscience knows too little about the human brain to make statements regarding the subject.
1.10.1. Con: Proper conclusion comes from physics and quantum physics, not from neuroscience. In the bigger scale, free will is a construct, an ilusion. In the smallest scale, everything obeys the laws of physics.
1.10.2. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.
1.11. Con: In a neoevolutionary approach our consciousness is similar to a virtual machine were we can receive external inputs, build scenarios and make decisions based on possible simulations according to each action in a non-behaviorist manner. Free will comes from the fact that we are complex systems. Our choice between infinite and redundant combinations is like our soul algorithm. [Source: Richard Dawkins \(1976\). The Selfish GeneRichard Dawkins. Chapter 10:  Selfish Genes And Selfish Memes. Page 16.](http://cursos.itam.mx/akuri/2002/S12002/ST1/SelfGM.PDF)
1.11.1. Con: The "complexity" of a system has no bearing whatsoever on its ability to behave deterministically, the behavior of a [Virtual Machine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) is no less deterministic than that of a physical machine and the word  [Algorithm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) itself implies specification of behavior.
1.11.2. Con: Complexity is not incompatible with determinism. Therefore, this argument actually portrays "free will" as an illusion.
1.12. Con: Science has not yet provided us with the mechanism through which consciousness is generated and can therefore not speak to the availability of choice therein.
1.12.1. Con: [Emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) is the mechanism through which conciousness is generated.
1.13. Con: Science clearly shows that a response to a stimulus creates a decision to react to the stimulus. A decision is an act of free will.
1.13.1. Con: Free will cannot reasonably be defined as making a decision. One must make a decision "freely" for making a decision to be evidence of free will
1.14. Con: Free will is such a fuzzy concept and open to too much interpretation to be able to be verified by scientific observation.
1.14.1. Pro: Free could denote a subconscious reaction and not necessarily a conscious one.
1.14.2. Pro: If two identical animals make separate decisions under the same environmental conditions does that not show that the biological difference made a choice? Therefore, will is under the command of the individual at a biological level.
1.15. Con: The only way science can demonstrate the impossibility of free will is if it can accurately predict the outcomes on decisions made by a free subject \(not a rat in a cage for example\)
1.15.1. Con: Free will can be expressed in a contained environment.
1.15.1.1. Con: If the recipient is unaware that he/she is being tested his/her free will is unlikely to respond. Free will is only available when the subject is aware of the motivations of the actors upon their behaviour.
1.15.1.1.1. Con: Positing that free-will is something that only becomes "available" in certain circumstances is an ad-hoc stipulation that seems simply designed to circumvent evidence available from empirical psychological studies. It has little relation to the phenomenon of free-will as traditionally discussed.
1.15.2. Con: Claiming that critics of free will have based their rejection of free on experiments done on "rats in a cage" is a strawman of the determinist position.
1.15.3. Con: Prediction is not a particularly good standard for accepting or rejecting the existence of the free will. Rather, most critics of the free will base their criticism on a description of human behavior that is compatible with determinism and consistent with naturalistic psychology \(and, the inference goes more likely to be deterministic\).
1.16. Pro: Because free will depends on brain activity, which as a biological entity relies on chemical reactions, and because all chemical reactions can be predicted \(if all the interacting factors can be known\), then free will is not physically possible.
1.16.1. Con: Science can not prove something impossible. Although all evidence points to the brain being no more than a physical entity -which does give rise to consciousness- it cannot demonstrate the impossibility of any given mechanism by which free will might operate.
1.17. Con: Science has not demonstrated the impossibility of anything, except logical impossibilities. Free will is not ruled out by logic, so no amount of scientific evidence can rule it out. Therefore, this debate question is not very useful.
1.17.1. Con: Asserting that science has only demonstrated the impossibility of logical impossibilities relies on an overly narrow understanding of both possibility and logic.
1.17.1.1. Pro: There are many common uses of the term "[impossible](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/impossible)" which are unrelated to logical impossibility.
1.17.1.1.1. Con: None of the listed definitions of [Impossible](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/impossible) mean very unlikely to exist or be true.
1.17.1.1.1.1. Pro: The linked definitions are, briefly; 1. Not possible 2. Feels impossible 3. Very Ubdesireable 4. Awkward or difficult to deal with \(as in an actor who is 'impossible' to deal with. None of these work here. Science doesn't prove any of these things
1.17.1.2. Pro: Even restricting the meaning of "impossible" to its use in logic, there is no need to assume that only self-contradictory things are impossible, provided we allow additional premises.
1.17.1.2.1. Pro: Assuming the truth of the scientific worldview, as the thesis suggests means that anything that is [inconsistent](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/112/Inconsistency) with that worldview is also impossible. There are plenty of things, such as the existence of [phlogiston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory), and [young earth creationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism) that have shown to be inconsistent with the modern scientific worldview. Even though not self-contradictory in a strictly logic sense, it is thus fair to say that science has shown the impossibility of those ideas.
1.17.1.2.1.1. Con: The thesis does not suggest that the scientific worldview is to be assumed to be correct.
1.17.1.2.1.2. Con: For something to be impossible, it must not be possible.
1.17.1.2.1.3. Con: The scientific worldview does not allow for impossibilities. A scientist must always be open to current theories being proven wrong and accepting new theories which better comport with observation. Thus, the scientific worldview can never declare anything impossible if it isn't a logical contradiction.
1.17.1.2.2. Con: Non contradictory things may be impossible but cannot be proved to be so via science
1.17.2. Pro: Because science makes use of logic, logical systems are a part of science and that which is proved to be a logical impossibility can also be considered impossible per the scientific worldview
1.18. Pro: Because the scientific method requires claims about the world to be falsifiable, it leaves no room for free will in its worldview.
1.18.1. Con: It's up to debate whether a scientific frame of knowledge is the only sort of genuine knowledge. Some philosophers, for example [Dilthey](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dilthey/), have argued that human truths are just as certain as naturalistic truths.
1.18.2. Con: The scientific method and science are not the same thing, so it doesn't matter if the scientific method leaves room for free will.
1.18.3. Con: Science has at least been around since organisms could use tools \(more than 3 million years ago\). The scientific method developed since the 17th century as an advancement of scientific thinking while proving that science can evolve. If science can evolve, eventually, the scientific method will no longer be the best method for testing science. So, whether or not we can currently test the existence of free will using the scientific method is irrelevant.
1.18.4. Pro: Science operates according to the principle of sufficient reason, which states that everything must have a cause. Free will, according to many philosophers, is a spontaneous, or uncaused action. According to this definition, there is, in principle, no way a scientist could falsify claims about the free will.
1.18.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.
1.18.6. Con: The falsifiable component of scientific method aims to determine what the world is not. From a free will perspective this means that, given a dozen seemingly viable choices, we can choose from the set shown to be non-false. In a world with practically infinite creative variations on action, falsifying a subset does not produce a deterministic outcome.
1.18.7. Con: Not all theories of science make falsifiability central to how science progresses.
1.18.7.1. Pro: [Paul Feyerabend](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feyerabend/#AgaiMeth1970) takes an "epistemological anarchism" in which there is no overarching methodological consistency to scientific inquiry, including falsification.
1.18.7.2. Pro: Although [Kuhn's](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incommensurability/#RevParThoKuhInc) account of scientific revolutions doesn't necessarily rule out the centrality of falsifiability, it shows that paradigm shifts change what counts as potentially falsifying and falsifiable.
