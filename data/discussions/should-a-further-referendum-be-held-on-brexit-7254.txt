Discussion Title: Should A Further Referendum Be Held On Brexit?

1. A further referendum should be held on Brexit
1.1. Pro: The 'Leave' campaign has been subject to heavy criticism of their dealings in the lead-up to the election.
1.1.1. Pro: There are allegations that the Leave campaign may have breached election law on funding. An investigation is ongoing.[Electoral Commission launches inquiry into leave campaign funding](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/20/electoral-commission-launches-inquiry-into-leave-campaign-funding)
1.1.1.1. Con: The result of that investigation is Leave followed the advice they asked for from the electoral commission - and that the electoral commission advised them wrongly [channel4.com](https://www.channel4.com/news/electoral-commission-gave-wrong-advice-to-vote-leave-says-court)
1.1.2. Pro: Claims of the Leave campaign, most infamously the 350m/week claim, have been found to be factually inaccurate.

[UK Statistics Authority statement on the use of official statistics on contributions to the European Union](https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/news/uk-statistics-authority-statement-on-the-use-of-official-statistics-on-contributions-to-the-european-union/)
1.1.2.1. Con: This is an oft cited red herring. Leaving the EU is a much bigger issue than this one point and voters had more on their minds. [10 reasons to leave the EU](https://www.capitalandconflict.com/brexit/ten-reasons-to-leave-eu/)
1.1.3. Pro: The Leave campaigners have been caught cheating, breaking electoral law. A second referendum is the only fair solution.
1.2. Con: Article 50 has been invoked, Britain will leave the EU whatever the result of a second referendum.
1.2.1. Con: The legality of invoking article 50 is being questioned in court.
1.2.2. Con: It is almost universally agreed that Article 50 could be revoked by an agreement of all EU member states.
1.2.2.1. Con: Getting all 27 other members of the EU to agree anything in the short time scale is verging on impossible. Getting the required universal agreement within the EU for it to move forward is one of its major weaknesses.
1.2.3. Con: The author of Article 50 and other legal experts believe that Article 50 can be unilaterally revoked by the UK.
1.2.4. Con: Member states signalled that they would accept the UK to stay.
1.3. Pro: The result was very close to 50-50, with [a lot of leave voters](http://uk.businessinsider.com/poll-majority-of-british-people-regret-voting-for-brexit-2018-4) expressing their remorse. With the result being so close to a tie, another referendum should be held until a larger percentage of the population is in agreement.
1.3.1. Con: There is no serious evidence to suggest that a significant number of Leave \(or Remain\) voters have changed their minds. The study cited gave its sample size as 1,659 \(i.e. 0.005% of those who voted in the referendum!\) which is insufficient to draw any valid conclusions. The referendum was to be decided by a simple majority, which was obtained by Leave. Another referendum is highly unlikely to produce a different result, but risks undermining democracy, or at least, the public's perception of it.
1.3.1.1. Con: According to [www.raosoft.com](http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html), with an electoral register size of some 47 million voters \([www.electoralcommission.org.uk](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/elections-and-referendums/past-elections-and-referendums/electoral-registration-at-the-uk-general-election-2017/2-the-size-of-the-electoral-register)\), a sample of 1068 voters or more will give an error margin of +/- 3% 95% of the time. A sample size of 1843 voters would give an error margin of +/- 3% 99% of the time. So a sample size of 1659 *is* statistically sufficient to draw valid conclusions from.
1.3.2. Pro: The democratic "will of the people" cannot be stated when less than a third of the people that have a vote actually voted for Leave. On a larger scale only 26% of the country's population voted for leave, meaning that 74% didn't. So by proceeding with the status quo and leaving, 26% of the country is over ruling the other 74%, that is not democracy as it should work.
1.4. Pro: Parliament itself is hopelessly divided and a constitutional crisis may be avoided by a second referendum.
1.4.1. Con: Another referendum may trigger a snap election, leaving the winning party to deal with the outcome.
1.4.2. Con: Another referendum would deepen divisions in the country already caused by the first one, with no guarantee of political certainty. Extremist groups could gain mainstream popularity.
1.4.2.1. Con: A shiny rainbow and unicorn Brexit would also deepen divisions and might entrench the government's authoritarian position. For the benefit of those who have been under a rock since the vote, both the people & parliament have had to fight tooth & nail for any say in the proceedings at all, which is particularly odd since the government cannot even agree with itself about how to proceed.
1.4.2.2. Con: Another referendum need not deepen divisions if it is asked on the right question.
1.5. Con: We are in a representative democracy for a reason, where the parliament is called upon to decide for the common good. Passing the buck to the population means only taking away the responsibility of making that decision. A second referendum would be a mistake as the first one.
1.5.1. Con: This is perhaps the best argument against any further referendums on the topic. However, as our elected representatives seem to be reluctant to acknowledge that "the will of the people" may have changed now the costs and complexities of leaving are becoming apparent, a referendum on the future relationship \(i.e. "the deal"\) may be necessary to give an unequivocal mandate for future action by the Government.
1.6. Con: If Parliament cements the perception that it knows better than the electorate it is supposed to serve by instituting a second referendum, there will be irrevocable damage to our democracy. If it were to be called the first manifestation of this could be a greater leave vote anyway.
1.6.1. Con: If "the will of the people" is still to leave the EU, then a referendum on the deal is nothing to fear. In a 2012 speech on the European Union \(EU\), Mr David Davis MP said: “If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy”.
1.6.1.1. Con: A vote was held, the result of that vote should be implemented before another vote is held. It is like having a general election and the Party that lost demanding another vote the next day before the winning Party can form a new Government.
1.6.2. Pro: The call for a further referendum would surely only satisfy the part of the electorate that didn’t get the answer they voted for. Since the result of the referendum, certain parts of society have lived in a dream world that Brexit can’t and won’t happen, another referendum would only fuel the disbelief in the losing percentage of the country.
1.6.3. Pro: The 2016 referendum result and the 2017 General Election manifestos of both Tory and Labour Parties on leaving the EU, which represented well over two thirds of the 2017 electorate, should be implemented first before further referendums on EU membership are held. To do otherwise would seriously undermine the democratic process.
1.6.4. Con: This is the exact opposite of saying that parliament knows better, it is asking for permission to make a major change that was requested but the detail of which was not foreseen.
1.6.4.1. Con: It is parliament's job to know better: that is precisely what we pay them for. They should be selected to be the best people we have and with all the resources they have available to help the in their job, if they don't even manage to know better than average, then that is pretty poor show.
1.6.5. Con: It is the first responsibility of every Member of Parliament to do what is right and in the best interest of the country according to their conscience, not to blindly follow public opinion. [publications.parliament.uk](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmmodern/337/33706.htm)
1.6.5.1. Con: It is the first responsibility of every member of parliament to represent their constituents and fulfill promises made to them while campaigning to be elected. MPs are supposed to represent people not make decisions for them.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: [publications.parliament.uk](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmmodern/337/33706.htm)
1.7. Con: There has already been a general election since the last referendum, which gave people the option of voting for a party that [promised a second referendum](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-39942573). That party got less that 10% of the vote, while parties that promised not to have a second referendum got [over 80%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2017/results) of the vote.
1.7.1. Con: In a two party state such as the UK, when there is such an important issue at stake, people cannot afford to waste their votes on hopeless parties: every vote is needed to prevent the wrong party from getting a majority. This time the electorate very carefully voted to deny either Brexit party a clear win.
1.8. Con: A second referendum would cause immense instability.
1.8.1. Pro: A second referendum would just divert resources away from the task at hand. Leave would have to negotiate and get back on the campaign trail where as the remain just have to campaign.
1.8.1.1. Con: The negotiations will be the easiest in human history. [telegraph.co.uk](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/05/no-one-said-brexit-would-easy-says-david-davis-sure/)
1.8.1.2. Con: The government can get on with failing to negotiate and keep out of the campaigning altogether, as they should have done in the earlier referendum.
1.8.2. Pro: Additional instability caused by a second referendum would be bad for business and the broader economy.
1.8.2.1. Con: Predictions made on the economical, cultural and social effects of the UK leaving the EU are all hypothetical. Leave the EU, and if a political party wants to join the EU they can have a manifesto offering a referendum on membership of the EU. This is what the Conservative manifesto offered the British people, they were voted into power and held accountable to holding a referendum. This is how the political system works in the UK.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: Sadly, the "predictions made on the economical, cultural and social effects of the UK leaving the EU" *aren't* all hypothetical. EU citizens \(including NHS workers\) *are* leaving the UK, the European Medicines Agency *has* left \(taking 900 jobs\), banks *are* moving some operations away from London to the EU \(along with those jobs, tax contributions & effect on suppliers\), UK music festivals *are* finding musicians are less motivated to play. Meanwhile, the promised benefits aren't materialising.
1.8.2.1.1.1. Con: Actual figures show as far as the NHS is concerned while EU citizens are leaving a larger number are arriving and 1 year after the vote to leave the actual number EU employees in the NHS had gone up to record levels [brexitcentral.com](https://brexitcentral.com/claims-exodus-eu-nhs-staff-not-nhs-own-data/).
1.8.2.1.2. Pro: The EU and UK have agreed a two year transition period. Only at this point will we be able to judge what a deal with the EU will look like.
1.8.2.1.3. Con: Leaving the EU will terminate the exceedingly good deal the UK currently has - with lots of opt-outs, a big rebate on what our normal contribution rate would be, etc. Rejoining would not be on the same terms. Leaving now involves irrevocable loss.
1.8.2.1.3.1. Con: Only Germany and the UK pay more into the EU then they get back.
1.8.2.1.4. Con: The Conservative Party was not voted into power. They had a majority and lost it, needing the dup to prop them up.
1.8.2.1.4.1. Con: Both main parties \(Labour and Conservative\) campaigned on manifestos stating they would honour the decision of the referendum and take Britain out of the EU. Regardless of which party forms government the vast majority of MPs were elected promising to leave.
1.8.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Presuming that the electorate doesn't understand its own constitution is no way to show respect.
1.8.2.2. Con: A second referendum would reduce uncertainty because either Britain would stay in the EU or would definitely be leaving.
1.8.2.2.1. Con: Not so. If another referendum results in the UK remaining in the EU then a lot of very rich people will be very upset: they will continue to try to pull the UK out. It is a simple folly to assume that such a well established and entrenched organisation as the ERG would simply give up & go home.
1.8.2.3. Con: With VAT needing to be paid up front, high import and export tariffs, looming shortage of seasonal workers, the plunge from the fastest growing to the slowest growing G7 country in 1 year, along side many, many more issues that will impact British business and the economy negatively, it will be a positive boon to British industry to know that they could continue to trade freely and on level terms with the biggest trading block in the world. Protect British industry, and hold a second referendum.
1.9. Con: A decision has been made. One cannot continue to hold referendums until the result is acceptable.
1.9.1. Con: The voting distribution was highly skewed based on age \(older voters disproportionately voting for leave\), in the eighteen months since the referendum enough younger voters have entered the electorate to change the result.
1.9.1.1. Con: This is an argument against referendums as a whole as any referendum is only ever a snapshot of the popular will on the day.
1.9.2. Con: The referendum was advisory. MPs will have a vote on the final outcome which could see the withdrawal of Article 50, default to WTO rules or a deal which includes SM and CU membership \(with the attached responsibilities\). With a slim majority the government will not be able to force through an unpopular choice so may have to hold a further referendum.
1.9.2.1. Pro: The Irish border issue is not likely to be satisfactorily resolved unless the latter choice is made.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: A new referendum may not solve the Irish border issue. It could be solved by EU granting Ireland special status to trade with the UK.
1.9.2.1.1.1. Con: If the EU did so, then the Republic of Ireland could well become a backdoor into the rest of the EU for non-EU compliant goods shipped via the UK then Ireland. And anyway, the EU is probably unwilling to even risk that, when it's the UK choosing to leave the EU, not the EU choosing to eject the UK.
1.9.2.2. Con: Whilst the referendum was advisory, all sides prior to the vote stated they would implement the decision made by the public.
1.9.3. Pro: If MPs wished to cancel / reverse Brexit, they could simply do so, a second referendum is unnecessary.
1.9.3.1. Con: Such a decision will be seen as undemocratic by many. A second referendum offers the only legitimate means to overturn a first.
1.9.3.1.1. Con: Labour as well as the Tories [support Brexit](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/25/john-mcdonnell-labour-members-didnt-want-to-split-party-on-brexit). It is therefore unlikely either will overturn their mandates.
1.9.3.2. Pro: There should be no need for another referendum: parliament should do its duty and not try to abrogate responsibility again.
Court papers have been served in an attempt to force them to do this, for more information or to give your support see: [www.crowdjustice.com](https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/a50-chall-her-e50/) or search for #A50Challenge
1.9.4. Pro: In the General Election of 2017, over 80% of votes were for parties who were committed to continuing with Brexit.
1.9.4.1. Pro: The Liberal Democrats sought a Mandate to overturn the Referendum result and failed to obtain it. [Liberal Democrat 2017 Advert.](https://youtu.be/a72XJWmBM6w?t=28s) [Liberal Democrat 2017 Manifesto Broken Down By BBC. Brexit Category.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-39946809)
1.9.4.2. Con: As a 'general' election covering all issues, people were not only voting on the issue of Brexit.
1.9.4.3. Con: In most constituencies, a vote against the two major parties \(both of whom were committed to Brexit\) would have been wasted.
1.9.4.4. Con: Voting *against* the party you do not want is an equally valid choice, so it is just as valid to say that 94% of votes were *against* pro-Brexit parties.
1.9.4.5. Con: [Polling data](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40630242) shows that people who voted for those both Labour and Conservative in 2017 election wished to remain in the EU.
1.9.5. Con: In a democracy, serious constitutional decisions must be made by parliament, not by the Prime Minister alone.
1.9.6. Con: The referendum vote was made with extremely imperfect knowledge. It is only sensible to revisit the decision now we have significantly more information.
1.9.6.1. Pro: The leave campaign promoted misleading information about the UK's relationship with the EU, causing voters to make their decision based on poor information.
1.9.6.2. Pro: The call for another referendum has nothing to do with the result, but about the process which was massively flawed in almost every detail.
1.9.6.2.1. Pro: The Scottish Referendum is widely held as a Gold Standard of how to do these things and they appear to have taken every lesson from that and done the opposite.
1.9.7. Pro: If we have a second vote, there can be no argument if some in the electorate want a third vote.
1.9.7.1. Con: The argument for a referendum on the terms of leaving hinges on there being new information and a change of circumstances. Anyone wanting a third vote would need to demonstrate more than just a desire.
1.9.8. Con: There is no suggestion that there would be an endless series of referendums, just one on the proposed terms of leaving the EU once known.
1.9.9. Pro: In fact we have already had 3 votes on this matter. The first was in 2015 when the Conservatives won the election with a majority, with a major manifesto point being that they would hold a referendum on the EU. Then we had the 2015 referendum followed by a 2017 election where 572 seats were taken by the two main parties both with manifesto's stating they'd leave the EU. Thus to actually be leaving three elections have had to go in favour of Leave already.
1.9.10. Con: The first Brexit vote was manipulated by [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_Brexit_referendum) in order to achieve the geopolitical goal of separating the UK from Europe, as outlined by Alexander Dugin in his book [Foundations of Geopolitics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_Brexit_referendum).
1.9.11. Con: The UK constitution requires that a decision such as this is made by parliament: it is fundamentally undemocratic and unconstitutional to treat that referendum as a decision. The decision to leave was made by the PM to suit the purposes of the Conservative Party.
1.9.12. Con: Leading figures of the Leave campaign argued that a close result for remain may lead to a second referendum.[Nigel Farage: Narrow Remain win may lead to second referendum](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36306681)
1.9.13. Pro: In a mature, modern democracy contentious referendums will be close calls by their nature. Clear consensus will be acted on before reaching this stage or referendums will be called merely to 'rubber stamp' a consensus. There is too much risk of social media and TV being used to weight an argument to an outcome favourable to status quo over change if contentious referendums are repeated.
1.9.13.1. Con: The only other recent referendum of the UK as a whole \(the Alternative Vote referendum\) produced a clear result - 67/32.

UK national/region referenda since 1997, have shown varied results:
* Scottish devolution, 1997 - 74/26
* Welsh devolution, 1997 - 50.3 / 49.7
* Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement, 1998 - 71/29
* Greater London Authority, 1998 - 72 / 28
* North East England devolution, 2004 - 22/78
* Welsh devolution, 2011 - 63/37
* Scottish independence, 2014 - 45/55
1.9.14. Con: The referendum of June 2016 was already the second on the relationship of the UK and the European institutions that later became the EU, the first being held in 1975.
1.9.14.1. Pro: A third referendum would only relate to accepting the negotiated exit treaty. If this is rejected and Article 50 suspended, a future government can return with a more acceptable exit treaty.
1.9.14.2. Con: There was a gap of around 40 years with significant change in-between such as Maastricht, Lisbon Treaty, Schengen etc.
1.9.14.2.1. Pro: There was not even a EU during the time of the first referendum.
1.9.14.2.2. Pro: New procedures that improved in efficiency at the cost of autonomy, such as the [Ordinary Legislative Procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_legislative_procedure#Ordinary_legislative_procedure), where not in place when the UK held its first referendum.
1.10. Pro: In the previous vote the details of what Brexit means were unclear.
1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.6.
1.10.2. Pro: The referendum was about leaving the EU, this is currently being pursued. A vote on the terms of leaving the EU is still needed.
1.10.2.1. Con: Referendums are not suited to questions with more than two answers.
1.10.3. Pro: The terms of the 2016 referendum question were heavily biased towards a leave result: there was no single vision of what leaving would mean, only a wide array of superficially attractive supposed "possibilities" - most of which were infact impossibilities. It's much too easy to vote against something, whether or not you understand it, if nobody's being held to account for the consequences.
1.10.4. Con: There was significant debate leading up to the choosing of the [referendum question](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/192075/EU-referendum-question-assessment-report.pdf) and the final wording was utterly clear: "Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?". It is down to the voter to inform themselves of what the implications of leaving the EU are and to vote accordingly. It is not right to claim the referendum was unclear because voters allowed themselves to be confused.
1.10.4.1. Pro: It is disingenuous to suggest that large numbers of people did not understand what they were voting for or the potential consequences.
1.10.4.2. Con: If the UK were to leave the EU, but join EFTA, this would technically fulfil the mandate given by the referendum result. This would likely be acceptable to many Leave and Remain voters alike, but would cross many of the Government's current "red lines". A further referendum could present this as an option, allowing the electorate to choose to give \(or withhold\) their mandate for this course of action.
1.10.4.2.1. Con: The EFTA \("Norway"\) option anchors us to a Europe that doesn't like us, and removes our ability to influence it. It is objectively the worst of all possible outcomes.
1.10.4.2.1.1. Con: If so, then there's nothing to fear, as it would be rejected by majorities of both previous Leave and Remain voters, leaving the viable options of chaotic no-deal no-transition Leave, or revoke the UK's A50 notification and Remain.
1.10.4.3. Con: It is difficult for voters to inform themselves correctly when they are directly being fed [lies](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-nhs-350m-a-week-eu-change-britain-gisela-stuart-referendum-bus-a7236706.html) which could sway their decision. Those attempting to educate themselves about the implications of Brexit are inevitably going to struggle if all they can find is misinformation.
1.10.4.4. Con: This claim states that the referendum question was "Utterly clear", yet still sees confused by it. The wording says "Should" which is unambiguously non-obligatory.
1.10.5. Con: The details of the UK leaving the EU are too technically complex for the general public to make an informed decision about.
1.10.5.1. Pro: Not only are the details of leaving the EU too complex for an average voter to understand, they are clearly also too complex for some of our elected politicians to understand. For example, [Nadine Dorries had to ask what a customs union involved.](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexspence/heres-a-leaked-whatsapp-chat-showing-tory-leavers-confusion)
1.10.5.2. Con: If the details are so complex, a referendum on the decision itself was inappropriate.
1.10.5.3. Con: While it's true that the details can be complex in some cases, many of us never-the-less do seem to understand them reasonably well, and most people would manage to understand them given the chance, were they explained effectively and honestly and not shrouded in lies and deceits.
1.10.6. Pro: As different ways to leave the EU are proposed and defended, with still no certainty as to how it will end up, we can clearly see that the "Leave" option was underplanned.
1.10.6.1. Pro: The government has not prepared adequately for Brexit.
1.10.6.1.1. Pro: No impact studies have been performed.
1.10.6.1.2. Pro: The government ministers do not agree amongst themselves what should be the desired outcome of the Brexit negotiations.
1.11. Pro: David Cameron did not initiate the EU referendum with the caveat that the British people are never allowed to change their minds, nor that they would never be allowed to re-evaluate the decision once made.
1.11.1. Con: David Cameron made clear the UK did not hold 'Neverendums' and that this decision would be once in a lifetime. [Cameron rejects Neverendum proposed by Farage](https://www.ft.com/content/139a0c5e-1c25-11e6-a7bc-ee846770ec15) [Official Remain Leaflet distributed to every household via tax payer - Page 14: "Once in a generation decision."](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515068/why-the-government-believes-that-voting-to-remain-in-the-european-union-is-the-best-decision-for-the-uk.pdf)
1.11.2. Pro: Britain is a democracy and one of the pillars of a democracy is that voters are allowed to change their minds.
1.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.
1.11.4. Pro: Polls indicate that a majority of the British public support holding a second referendum.[Second Brexit referendum has 16-point lead as half of Britons back new vote, opinion poll shows](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/britons-majority-in-favour-of-public-vote-on-final-brexit-deal-uk-politics-a8089161.html)
1.11.4.1. Con: Government policy should not be based upon polling.
1.11.4.2. Con: Polls can be biased in the way that questions are asked and results presented.
1.11.4.2.1. Con: The British polling council exists to advise on best practice in polling and ensure that full results are available for independent analysis.
1.11.4.2.2. Con: Reputable polling companies act to ensure that polls are as representative of the general population as possible.
1.11.4.3. Con: UK convention has it that referendums are called by the will of parliament and are not 'bottom-up' public plebiscites. [UK Referendums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendums_in_the_United_Kingdom). It is the duty of the sovereign parliament to conclude that they need to be advised by a referendum.
1.12. Pro: People with a legitimate and immediate interest in the result of the referendum \(especially EU citizens, UK citizens resident in other EU countries\) were not included in the franchise.
1.12.1. Con: This point has been tested in court and failed.
1.12.1.1. Con: No court covers all jurisdictions: it is being tested again in another court.
1.12.1.2. Con: Court decisions determine legality, not morality.
