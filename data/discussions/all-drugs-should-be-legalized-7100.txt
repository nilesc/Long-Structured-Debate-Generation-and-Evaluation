Discussion Title: All drugs should be legalized.

1. All drugs should be legalised.
1.1. Pro: Right now, policies on drugs are very arbitrary \(e.g., alcohol is considered a [hard drug](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_drugs)\) which is detrimental to their legitimacy. Having a less hypocrite stance on drug legislation \(for example legalising and monitoring all drug markets\) could improve the legitimacy of government while minimizing negative effects that are caused by the criminalization of 'illegal' drugs \(such as violence, theft, murder...\)
1.2. Con: Legalizing all drugs \(not only soft ones\) would be seen as a giving up sign from the government/authority on that matter.
1.2.1. Con: It’s not wrong to give up when you realize you are doing something wrong. Humans don’t need an ok from anyone to alter their consciousness. They’ve been doing it since before they were human. It’s a natural behavior among our species and many others. Drugs happen to be a very effective way of inducing altered states. Even little kids spin around till they’re incredibly dizzy. Both, escaping AND expanding our perspective on reality results from our intellect, playful curiosity,& pain.
1.2.1.1. Pro: [The use of psychoactive substances](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3202501/) has been part of human culture for thousands of years; drugs have been used for religious, medical or recreational purposes.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The consumption of psychoactive substances creates religious and transcendental [experiences](https://www.sciencealert.com/how-religion-led-to-humanity-s-love-for-drugs): both are a relevant part of human evolution and significantly shaped human culture.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Many drugs have [traditional or religious uses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entheogen), including psilocybin mushrooms, salvia divinorum, ayahuasca, peyote, and tobacco. Not all of these drugs are protected for such purposes. Legalising them uniformly would enable people to undergo the experiences of these drugs in their original context, supervised by those who are adept in the practices of using them that have been developed over many generations—the absence of which may be harmful when they are taken purely recreationally.
1.2.1.1.3. Pro: [Entheogenic drugs](https://maps.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5468), such as psychedelics, have been used throughout human history for many benefits in evolutionary growth and cognitive development. Illegality over the last century has halted research on the many new psychoactive substances that have been discovered in that time \(as well as traditional ones\). These substances may have the potential to solve problems in our society such as the mental health crisis. At the very least drugs should be given a license for scientific research.
1.2.2. Pro: When the government legalises something, it sends the message that the substance is acceptable and a legitimate form of recreation. This may encourage people to become involved in drug taking.
1.2.2.1. Con: Through education, heavy advertising campaigns and controlling the packaging of tobacco, the government makes the effects of smoking clear, despite it being legal.
1.2.2.2. Con: If people get pleasure out of taking drugs then there is not necessarily anything wrong with this.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Unfortunately, taking pleasure out of something does not make it automatically good. The very aptitude of human parents to teach their children that pleasure does not systematically remove danger is one of the key reasons our species has thriven so far.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Deriving pleasure from something doesn't make it automatically bad, either. For drugs that are not harmful, or whose potential for harm can be managed responsibly, there is no reason to discourage responsible use just because they are drugs. Alcohol is a drug.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: One of the pleasures of recreational drugs lies in its unavailability. The moment it becomes available it will lose all its charm. Why do you want weed to become a cig?
1.2.2.2.3. Con: Short-term pleasure from additive drug consumption may lead to [irreversible impairments](https://www.health24.com/Medical/Osteoporosis/News/Graphic-This-drug-will-kill-you-within-two-years-20140709), sufficiently lowering the consumer's quality of life and unnecessarily burdening the society with the need to care of the survivors.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Without proper education, people who are more prone to drug addiction may be more likely to get addicted to a drug.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: The lack of proper education is a separate issue. As this is also true under prohibition, it's also an argument _for_ proper education, not an argument against legalization.
1.2.2.3.2. Con: In general, people will and do have a better idea of how to safely use and interact with legal intoxicants because there is realistic media representation of risk and use an open, less stigmatized conversation around the individual legal substances.
1.2.2.4. Con: Many dangerous substances and activities are already legal. However, people overwhelmingly decide not to do such dangerous things anyway.
1.2.2.5. Con: There are more problems with substance \(ab\)use now, than before they even sent the signal that it's unacceptable. Being threatened with violence for peaceful activity is typically considered abuse and not friendly advice.
1.2.3. Con: "Giving up" is preferable to endlessly pursuing an unobtainable goal.
1.2.4. Con: It is not the purpose of legislation to send public health messages.
1.2.5. Con: Taking a more effective approach is not giving up.
1.2.6. Con: Our governments are not tyrannies that rule by commanding the respect and fear of the people, but elected democracies. The do not need to maintain an appearance of being tough on their own peoples.
1.2.7. Con: Current drug legislation undermines the \(moral\) authority of the law, as governmental action is not based on facts, evidence and latest research but on outdated knowledge as well as on ideology.
1.2.7.1. Pro: There is [no scientific evidence or clear definition](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-difference-between-soft-drugs-and-hard-drugs-22308) of the concepts 'hard' or 'soft' drugs meaning people will and can use it however they fit it into their personal ideology or the goal they have in mind. This is very detrimental to the legitimacy of the legislation.
1.2.7.2. Pro: Many current drug legislations are not in accordance with [rational facts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/01/09/the-irrationality-of-modern-drug-laws-in-one-chart/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.62bb2fdcf331); in fact, modern drug laws can be regarded as utterly irrational.
1.2.8. Con: Addicts are forced to buy legally, therefore, there is a public record of their usage and authorities can intervene if there is an abuse of drug usage.
1.2.9. Con: The Government is not giving up authority it is giving it back to the individual; as taking drugs is a individual choice with any harm done to the individual only, governance of such choice ought to remain with the individual. Unless, that individuals actions are affecting others; for example, Alcohol and Drunk driving; you allow the first you prohibit the second.
1.2.10. Con: The current U.S. government suffers nothing from the Alcohol Prohibition in the 1930s. The damage to our reputation from ending marijuana or other prohibitions would be fleeting.
1.2.11. Con: Legalizing something does not indicate giving up. One should create laws with progress and enlightenment serving as a foundation for the people.
1.3. Con: The consequences that may be caused by freely available drugs are simply too dangerous to attempt.
1.3.1. Pro: Just like guns, increased accessibility to all drugs \(even lethal ones\) will probably cause heightened use of it in criminal environments and therefore lead to more crimes which is an unwanted effect for society as a whole.
1.3.2. Con: If we would forbid everything that is assumed to be "too dangerous," life would be boring.
1.3.3. Pro: Humans are largely at the whims of impulse and habit, therefore a drug addict can in no way be considered free. Thus drugs are the tyrant which limits freedom.
1.3.3.1. Con: This fact is further compounded when you are at the whim of a tyrannical government which is waging a 'war on drugs'. By legalising you remove one pressure and lesser prejudices. Addicts would be more able to seek help without fear of prosecution.
1.3.3.2. Con: In the same way that people sign contracts in which they voluntarily limit their freedom for a certain amount of time, a person who chooses freely to take drugs is choosing to limit their self-control freely. In either case, the initial choice is still a free choice.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: Both of these "contracts" are often initiated under desperate circumstances or by ill informed people.
1.3.4. Con: We must consider the term 'dangerous.' Who decides what is too dangerous? Additionally, is it more dangerous on the black market or in the retail environment?
1.3.5. Con: Even methamphetamine \("ice"\) and diacetylmorphine \("heroin"\) are used as prescription medications in many Western countries without a problem. This suggests it is the context, not the substance, that is dangerous.
1.3.6. Con: Banning drugs actually cause them to become more dangerous. There is little accountability for people who produce poor quality or poisonous substances, and young people sometimes take excessive amounts and overdose when they see police, to avoid being arrested.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Commercially legalized drugs urge strict regulation.
1.3.7. Pro: Some drugs are toxic at very low doses. These drugs can rightfully be considered weapons as well as intoxicants.
1.3.7.1. Con: There are legal substances which have a much higher toxicity and legal substances which can be developed to be highly toxic. Ricin for instance, which is created from castor beans. The possible use of drugs as weapons is irrelevant as there are much more dangerous substances freely available.
1.3.7.2. Con: If these substances legitimately are so dangerous, they _should_ primarily be considered weapons and not drugs. They can then be ignored in this discussion.
1.3.8. Con: What a person does to their own body is their own decision. That includes taking dangerous drugs.
1.3.8.1. Con: Drug addicts have limited autonomy, therefore their ability to chose what is proper for themselves should not be taken for granted.
1.3.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.
1.3.8.2. Con: When drug use leads to violence there is a harm to others. Individuals then have a responsibility to refrain from taking dangerous drugs.
1.3.8.2.1. Con: Individuals using drugs have the responsibility to take precautions to avoid acting violent, not the responsibility of refraining from taking drugs.
1.3.8.2.1.1. Con: Some drugs cause an extreme loss of judgment, meaning that taking them is choosing to lose control over one's \(potentially violent\) actions. Any consequences of that choice to forfeit control can be attributed to the drug user.
1.3.8.2.2. Con: Most violence related to drug effects are limited to a small subset of all drugs. One of the worst being the legal drug alcohol.
1.3.8.2.2.1. Pro: [Alcohol](https://theconversation.com/alcohol-leads-to-more-violence-than-other-drugs-but-youd-never-know-from-the-headlines-72281) is responsible for more violence and harm than any other drug.
1.3.8.2.2.1.1. Pro: Unlike other drugs, [alcohol](http://theconversation.com/alcohol-leads-to-more-violence-than-other-drugs-but-youd-never-know-from-the-headlines-72281) negatively influences the function of the pre-frontal cortex; this part of the brain regulates social interaction and behaviour. As a result, primed individuals tend to make poor decisions and generally act more emotionally and unreasonably.
1.3.8.2.2.1.2. Pro: [A study](http://aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/tandi_pdf/tandi372.pdf) came to the conclusion that alcohol consumption was involved in 47% of homicides in Australia in a six-year period.
1.3.8.2.2.1.3. Con: This can be explained by the [widespread](https://theconversation.com/alcohol-leads-to-more-violence-than-other-drugs-but-youd-never-know-from-the-headlines-72281) availability and use of alcohol, as well as its legal status.
1.3.8.2.2.1.4. Pro: Research suggests that [two-thirds](https://www.verywell.com/domestic-abuse-and-alcohol-62643) of incidents of domestic violence happen while the perpetrator is under the influence of alcohol.
1.3.8.2.2.1.4.1. Con: The source also argues that there is not necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship between alcohol and domestic violence. In fact, some experts suggest that abusers [use alcohol as an excuse](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/svaw/domestic/link/alcohol.htm) for their actions.
1.3.8.3. Con: In many countries health care is financed from public money so the health issues are public issues.
1.3.8.3.1. Pro: Most countries have socialised medicine to some degree, which means users do not bear the economic cost of their drug use. Ideally, people would have to pay for all the health costs of their drug use, be it in long-term or emergency hospital bills. Since in reality, this doesn't happen, their usage imposes a cost on the taxpayer.
1.3.8.3.1.1. Con: The same could be said not only for legal drugs \(alcohol, tobacco\) but also for junk food, sugar or fat rich food or beverage, too much stress, too much work, too much tv, lack of physical activity. All of these can lead to negative health outcomes that impose a cost on taxpayers.
1.3.8.3.2. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that legalising drugs will either increase drug use, or increase the amount spent by public healthcare on drug users.
1.3.8.3.3. Con: There are many fully legal substances \(cigarettes, alcohol\), which are very dangerous to users' health, and all citizens are paying for it. On the other hand, some drugs like marijuana or LSD used therapeutically, can contribute to reduced stress and better health. [link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01575629) , [medicalnewstoday.com](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317777.php)
1.3.8.3.4. Pro: Using drugs can have negative health effects curing which are expensive - that would come from public funds. Individual right to use drugs recreationally might come with voluntary giving up access to public healthcare.
1.3.9. Pro: Some drugs will lead to people having hallucinations or becoming violent. In these instances, the individuals are no longer just a danger to themselves but also to others, who the government has a duty to protect.
1.3.9.1. Con: The amount of people 'hallucinating' or 'being violent' due to drugs will not necessarily increase upon their legalisation.
1.3.9.1.1. Con: Going beyond the statistic, people like this should not be supported or incentivized by law.
1.3.9.1.1.1. Con: The science of Statistics is the established way that we measure and evaluate claims. Going 'beyond statistics' is dogmatic and inaccurate by definition.
1.3.9.1.2. Pro: Evidence does not suggest that criminalisation makes drug use decrease. [nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2017/09/14/marijuana-legalization-hasnt-led-to-more-drug-abuse-study/)
1.3.9.2. Con: Hallucinations do not harm other people.
1.3.9.3. Con: The legal regulation of hallucinogenic drugs would make it possible for them to be taken in a safe, supervised and protected environment.
1.3.9.4. Con: There's no reasonable way for folks to measure whether or not a drug-induced hallucinatory episode will become a violent episode any more than there's a way to determine whether someone is an angry or violent drunk. Instead the police simply deal with the drunkards after the fact rather than taking away alcohol from everyone.
1.3.9.5. Con: Something being dangerous does not necessarily mean it should be illegal. The government should provide a safe place to approach those activities, like shooting ranges, etc.
1.3.9.5.1. Con: It is not the government's responsibility to provide a safe place for dangerous recreational activities.
1.3.9.5.1.1. Con: Not taking responsibility for something that does happen \(a lot\) is the same as being of denial of an obvious fact and is therefore a harmful mindset. If it isn't the governments which takes responisibility to facilitate this, who else will?
1.3.9.5.2. Pro: The drug market is a supply and demand economic model. To control flow, experience in similar markets has shown it to be more effective to manage demand rather than trying to restrict supply. Managing legal access to addictive drugs facilitates the reduction of negative outcomes from both currently illegal drugs and over prescribed medication.
1.3.10. Con: We are currently facing a massive opioid crisis, the greatest drug epidemic in history is opiates, a highly addictive drug [provided legally by doctors](http://time.com/james-nachtwey-opioid-addiction-america/). The illegality of a drug does not provide a healthier society. We are undergoing a health crisis not a judicial crisis; the judicial system should not even have jurisdiction, as such the surgeon general should be the one to alleviate any health crisis.
1.3.11. Con: Many drugs have a long history of responsible use within their historical context.
1.3.11.1. Con: This is not true of all drugs.
1.3.11.2. Con: This ignores proportionality \(meaning how many people were negatively effected and to what magnitude\).
1.3.12. Pro: Some drugs are too addictive. We'd face a bigger health problem.
1.3.12.1. Pro: Sugar addiction is a good example of the consequences of making a product widely available.
1.3.12.1.1. Con: If your friend has a sugar addiction, you should talk to them, support them and educate them, not lock them up or confiscate their sugar.
1.3.12.1.2. Pro: Other examples are coffee and alcohol.
1.3.12.1.3. Con: Coffee is another legal, widely-available drug. Modern life has a "coffee culture" - near-universal use, coffee shops right on the high street, people who cant get going in the morning without their fix.

But is this really such a dreadful thing, outweighing all the negatives of criminalisation?
1.3.12.2. Con: Not necesarly. The money from taxation can be invested into rehabilitation centers, informative and support programs, etc.
1.3.12.2.1. Pro: Drug legalization improves government finances and leads to economic growth.
1.3.12.2.1.1. Pro: If drugs are legalized some of the [massive resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_drugs#Costs_to_taxpayers) spent on drug prohibition currently could be used for [harm reduction](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/harm-reduction-more-effective-than-war-on-drugs-in-b-c-1.1326963).
1.3.12.2.1.1.1. Pro: According to the [Global Commission on Drug Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Commission_on_Drug_Policy), the war on drugs was a failure.
1.3.12.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The US imposed war on drugs has a [devastating impact](https://www.unodc.org/documents/ungass2016/Contributions/Civil/OpenSociety/The_Economics_of_the_Drug_War_-_Unaccounted_Costs_Lost_Lives_Missed_Opportunities.pdf) on América from Mexico to Argentina and violence is only one aspect. Judicial systems and politicians are corrupted. In the Andes, [coca](https://nacla.org/article/beat-goes-us-war-coca), a sacred plant harmful when mass produced as a cash crop, has replaced the production of fruits and vegetables. Leaders are afraid to challenge US-led prohibition due to the risk of invasion and financial sanctions. Scarce resources are wasted on incarcerating users and micro-dealers rather than health care.
1.3.12.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: When fighting any “war” there’s a time to surrender when you’ve clearly been defeated. Especially if you’re the one who started the war.
1.3.12.2.1.1.2. Con: Or, the revenues could be used for wars in the middle east. Revenue is simply revenue - it is fungible. A dollar collected from a legal head shop is indistinguishable from any other dollar - it doesn't magically earmark itself for harm reduction. If a government wanted to put money into harm reduction, it could be doing that now with the money it already has.
1.3.12.2.1.2. Pro: If the government controlled \(or regulated\) the drug industry, it could be taxed heavily, as with alcohol and tobacco.
1.3.12.2.1.2.1. Pro: The highest tax estimates of marijuana legalisation reach[$28 billion](https://taxfoundation.org/marijuana-tax-legalization-federal-revenue/) from federal revenues, business taxes and income taxes.
1.3.12.2.1.2.2. Con: Taxes may ensure that a black market for drugs remains with all the dangers it already has. For example; many Canadian cigarettes are smuggled back into Canada.

[Contraband Tobacco](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/pblctns/archive-stts-cntrbnd-tbcc/index-en.aspx)
1.3.12.2.1.2.3. Pro: It is preferable that if people are going to take drugs, the profit of the industry go to the government to use to provide important services rather than to gangs or drug cartels.
1.3.12.2.1.2.4. Pro: Having taxes on the drugs use we could pay for the externalities of this use, like health issues.
1.3.12.2.1.3. Con: If drugs are legalised, they will not be as expensive as they are now. Estimations of tax revenue based on current prices are completely wrong.
1.3.12.2.1.4. Pro: It would create more jobs \(i.e. people selling in certified shops, people in labs etc.\), more money from tax and less people wrongly in jail.
1.3.12.2.1.5. Con: This is an argument of the ends justifying the means. The government could generate more income by simply taking everyone's money by force - that doesn't make it a good choice.
1.3.12.2.1.5.1. Con: This argument is prematurely claiming, that the means \(legislation of drugs\) are immoral to the moral end \(economic boost\), which is not to be decided by one individual. Whether it is moral or immoral is decided when it has already happened, and we could measure the impact on our society.
1.3.12.2.1.6. Con: Economic growth is caused by the creation of innovations that increase productivity and quality of life. Drug legalization would lead to decreased productivity in users, and the increased labor employed in the drug trade would take away from labor in other, more productive sectors.
1.3.12.2.1.6.1. Con: Some drugs elevate human productivity and quality of life.
1.3.12.2.1.7. Pro: For a drug user incarceration is much [more expensive](http://www.bhsbaltimore.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Incarceration-vs-Drug-Treatment-Costs.pdf) than treatment, particularly as many drug users are productive members of society.
1.3.12.3. Con: With legalization there would not be more people taking addictive drugs.
1.3.12.3.1. Con: People take addictive drugs all the time \(for any reasons\). Consider smoking individuals.
1.3.12.3.2. Pro: In states that have legalized drugs, there has been a drop in drug use [arktimes.com](https://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2017/12/13/teen-drug-use-dropped-after-colorado-legalized-marijuana)
1.3.12.3.3. Con: It is likely that a small group who are motivated not to take hard drugs solely because they are illegal would then try drugs.
1.3.12.3.3.1. Con: There are probably not many people who want to take 'hard' drugs but don't because they are illegal.
1.3.12.4. Con: Legalizing drugs would help treat addicts, since it will no longer be a taboo and drug users will not be such a target of prejudice.
1.3.12.4.1. Con: Legalization does not treat addicts, treatment and prevention of the addiction do. Both of which can be done with drugs remaining illegal.
1.3.12.4.2. Pro: Legalizing would lead to a better understanding of addiction in the first place. Specialists working for the government could provide the necessity of education on the subject of responsible substance use.
1.3.12.4.3. Con: If individuals are already addicted, legalisation just means they'll be able to get their drugs more easily, so they will tend to stay addicted.
1.3.12.4.3.1. Con: If they already are addicted, that would indicate they already have regular access to the drug. If they don't have a supportive family looking after them they could potentially be out on the streets and at the mercy of the drug dealers they depend on. The police can only arrest them, not help or protect them. Decriminilizing drug addiction and legalising the controlled use of drugs in rehab centres  would enable addicts to get weaned off the drug in a safe and supportive environment.
1.3.12.4.3.2. Con: [Data](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/marijuana) from the national drug use survey in 2017 actually suggests a decrease in drug abuse and use in states that have legalized marijuana. This decrease is the lowest of the decade.
1.3.12.4.4. Pro: Taking the stigma and secrecy away from drug taking would mean family and friends would notice problem use earlier and be able to intervene.
1.3.12.4.5. Con: It does not seem clear that legalising drugs will automatically remove the prejudice. If people see those on drugs being violent or a nuisance to society, the prejudice will likely remain.
1.3.12.4.5.1. Con: Although the social prejudice may remain addicts could seek help far easier if there was no fear of legal repercussions.
1.3.12.4.5.2. Con: While neither seems acceptable, most would rather face prejudice than prison.
1.3.12.4.5.3. Pro: [Alcohol-dependent persons](https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/46/2/105/198339) have to face prejudices, although the substance is legal: They are often held responsible for their condition, are subject to social rejection and they are at particular risk for structural discrimination.
1.3.12.4.6. Pro: When drugs are legalised people who are addicted may feel more comfortable seeking help and support as they won't be viewed as criminals in the way they currently are.
1.3.12.4.6.1. Pro: It is not a matter of being "viewed as" criminals: under a regime of criminalisation, drug users *are* criminals. It is not a matter of "feeling comfortable" seeking help, it's that seeking help would no longer carry the threat of actually going to prison.
1.3.12.4.6.2. Pro: Addiction \(whether to porn, sugar, cannabis, whatever\) is a disease which comes about because someone is trying to make up for a sadness. Perhaps they are lonely and don't get enough satisfying social interaction, or perhaps they feel that they have no professional future. By keeping drugs illegal, we reinforce this cycle by stopping these people from coming forward and getting help out of their difficult situations. If drugs were legal, people could acknowledge their problems and ask for help.
1.3.12.4.6.3. Pro: People in poor health or overdosing on drugs are often not taken to receive medical attention for fear of criminal prosecution.
1.3.12.4.7. Pro: Legalising drugs could help the process of viewing drug addiction as a disease rather than as a failing of the individual, and this could make people more open to seeking out treatment as they do not feel they will be judged so harshly.
1.3.12.4.8. Pro: An example of this is the abundance of help availble for those addicted to alcohol, tobacco and even marijuana lately. There is much less of a stigma associated with these substances making it more socially acceptable to approach family, friends, and especially medical professionals as there is a reduced fear of prosecution or repercussions.
1.3.12.4.9. Pro: Criminalizing and stigmatizing drug users/addicts increases the vulnerability of vulnerable populations such as domestic abuse victims and prostitutes who use drugs as a coping mechanism.
1.3.12.4.10. Pro: Addiction education could be funded through legalization. Addiction starts long before the first drug use. People that feel good about themselves and life don't see a need or want to use drugs. While some folks feel that they just wanted to use drugs in a recreational way, some have no clue why they are drawn to them vs. others who may try them once and leave them. [www.psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/heartache-hope/201306/low-self-esteema-disposition-can-lead-addiction). Self esteem/feeling good links to addictions have been known for decades. [www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3905528/)
1.3.12.5. Con: Most of the health problems resulting from drug abuse are actually the result of those drugs being illegal. There's no need to share needles if they're $2 at the local pharmacy.
1.3.12.6. Pro: If drugs are more easily accessible, it is likely more people will try them. Given the very addictive nature of some serious drugs, this will likely lead to a greater number of drug addicts.
1.3.12.6.1. Con: The Netherlands provides easier access to marijuana, however, there are many countries with stricter laws in which people use more marijuana: [www.telegraph.co.uk](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/mapped-the-countries-that-smoke-the-most-cannabis/)
1.3.12.6.2. Con: Legalizing drugs does not inherently mean they will be readily available.
1.3.12.6.3. Con: The taboo nature of criminalized drugs leads not only to their desirability as a novelty \(people want to try something naughty\) but also their desirability as a method of rebellion \(such as teenagers tend towards\). Legalization helps to remove the taboo.
1.3.12.7. Con: Evidence suggests that [addiction is not caused by drugs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8L-0nSYzg) but by social problems.
1.3.12.7.1. Con: Further studies on the "Rat Park" experiment discussed in the video [have found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park#Reaction_to_the_experiment) social isolation is not necessary for addiction.
1.3.12.8. Con: Tobacco and alcohol are harmful drugs, yet they are legal.
1.3.12.8.1. Pro: History and current data both prove that prohibition does not work.
1.3.12.8.2. Con: Right now we are facing huge health problems connected with overuse of these two drugs. We should think about how to prohibit alcohol and tobacco rather than legalise other drugs.
1.3.12.8.2.1. Con: We can do both.
1.3.12.9. Con: With enough research on how deadly some drugs are, people would be discouraged to try these substances.
1.3.13. Pro: Some drugs, such as scopolamine, pose inherent criminal risk if in the wrong hands.[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToQ8PWYnu04&t=67s)
1.3.14. Con: This perspective is completely invalid, being that there are plenty of legal drugs in the world.
1.3.15. Pro: Any substance that is proven \(scientifically or socially\) to deteriorate the body should be illegal.
1.3.15.1. Con: If so, then alcohol should also be prohibited. This was tried in the 1920's with disastrous results.
1.3.16. Con: -> See 1.2.8.
1.3.17. Con: Some drugs seem to be safer than others. For example, [Albert Hofman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Hofmann), the creator of LSD, took LSD for over two decades without any health implications.
1.3.18. Pro: There are drugs, such as heroin, which seem to be very detrimental to a persons health instantaneously.
1.3.18.1. Pro: Hard drugs such as heroin pose a danger to the life and productivity of the user, but also effect others.
1.3.18.1.1. Con: Legalisation of drugs allows for them to be made in government labs so therefore an increase in purity which is one of the main causes of death in lots of drugs.
1.3.18.1.1.1. Pro: Governments would be able to check what cutting agents are used within the drugs. Meaning they will be safer as potentially harmful cutting agents can be banned.
1.3.18.1.1.2. Con: There is no reason that the state would manufacture drug products in most western countries.
1.3.18.1.1.3. Pro: Many drug dealers put additives \(i.e., chalk in cocaine\) in order to maximise profits. If legalised, drug production would most likely be regulated by a government authority, preventing dangerous additives from entering the product and hence reducing the lethality of consumption.
1.3.18.1.1.4. Con: In a more likely scenario, private companies make the drugs, while the state's role is mostly regulatory. This also results in an increase of purity, but the means differ.
1.3.18.1.2. Con: This is true also for legal substances, like alcohol. Consequences of drug use should be dealt with in the same way: \(fines for driving under drug effects, social care for children ...\)
1.3.18.1.3. Con: Making something legal does not mean people will do it. If heroin were to become legal tomorrow, people wouldn't all of a sudden start shooting up. Also legalizing drugs doesn't mean stores would suddenly start popping up on every corner. I would imagine that most city councils would not approve a meth store next to the grocery store. At the end of the day, the government should not have a say in what you do with your own life.
1.3.18.1.4. Con: Heroin is a bad example of a drug that decreases productivity. It has been the catalyst for some of the best music and art ever created. Now once a physical dependence is reached then it’s the ABSENCE of heroin that causes the problems.
1.3.18.1.5. Pro: Children of heroin addicts for example, may be socialised in an environment that makes it likelier for them to consume and become addicts of hard drugs in the future. Legalising the use of hard drugs makes this outcome likelier.
1.3.18.1.5.1. Con: Children of drug addicts would have a much higher chance of receiving the appropriate help if drug users did not have to hide.
1.3.18.1.6. Con: -> See 1.2.8.
1.3.18.1.7. Con: It is easier to control and regulate the selling of drugs when they are legalised as governments can be involved.
1.3.18.1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.18.1.1.
1.3.18.1.8. Con: It is easier to facilitate treatment of drug abusers who are not breaking the law so a reduction of abuse can be expected.
1.3.18.1.9. Con: Hard drugs is a reason to suspect future or recent activity harmful to others. Not a proof and not harmful to others itself.
1.3.18.1.10. Con: Hard drugs, as a blanket term, is an oversimplification of classification. Many falling under that distinction, like LSD or DMT do not have the long term deleterious effects that other drugs have.
1.3.18.1.10.1. Pro: [Psychedelics](https://psychedelictimes.com/psychedelic-therapy/are-psychedelics-addictive/) like LSD, Mushrooms and DMT don't lead to [addiction](http://psychedelics.com/psychedelic-drug-addiction/). Even MDMA usually does not lead to addiction.
1.3.18.1.10.1.1. Pro: Psychedelics are fun and less dangerous because those drugs are meant to have fun and experiment with and not to escape entirely from the reality like heroin, crack or meth.
1.3.18.1.10.1.1.1. Con: Psychedelic drugs user can't manage to do anything precise or complex, whereas other substances such as cocaine can focus you.
1.3.18.1.11. Con: Rights violations are adjudicated in court after the fact. Pre-legislating to avoid rights violations in advance results in a loss of freedom and an overbearing state, which then violates rights itself on a systematic basis.
1.3.18.2. Con: Heroin, as with other opiates, is considered fairly safe with regards to effects on the body.
1.3.18.3. Con: The problems seen in heroin addicts are primarily caused by complication related to injecting the substance, overdosing, social and economic problems and poor quality product, and not the drugs direct effects on the body.
1.3.19. Con: Banning drugs is akin to [Minority Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_\(film\)), it's arresting people for what they might do under the influence. We could as soon prosecute people for being out of work, drinking, gambling or adultery.
1.3.20. Con: -> See 1.3.9.5.
1.3.21. Con: Most recreational drugs are less harmful than tobacco or alcohol [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_harmfulness#/media/File%3ARational_harm_assessment_of_drugs_radar_plot.svg)
1.3.22. Con: It is more dangerous to keep the drugs in the hands of the cartels and gangs than in a regulated environment.
1.3.22.1. Pro: The highly prosperous business of drug dealing is currently in the hands of dangerous criminals. Legalization of drugs would drastically decrease the market for criminal organizations and largely diminish their income.
1.3.22.1.1. Pro: It's easier to regulate established companies in a legal market than it is in the black market. Any issue would be with bad regulations not legalization.
1.3.22.1.2. Con: Established companies selling drugs could be just as dangerous \(to society\) as criminals.
1.3.22.1.2.1. Con: Established companies would be strictly controlled.
1.3.22.1.2.1.1. Con: Currently in America there is a pharmaceutical opioid crisis. Drug companies and legal policies can not be trusted to protect citizens any more than cartels do.
1.3.22.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The opioid crisis in America isn't caused by the legality of opioids. There are a number of contributing factors, including overprescription, lacking regulations, and the current illegality of other less addictive alternatives. If we made opioids illegal, the problem would only get worse, and if we made other drugs legal, we would have more tools with which to fight the problem.
1.3.22.1.2.1.1.2. Con: At least pharmaceutical companies don't shoot people. There's just no honest comparison between unethical sale associates and murderous cartels.
1.3.22.1.2.1.2. Pro: If established companies behave inappropriately with regards to the selling of drugs, people would be able to report this without fear of facing consequences for trying to buy drugs.
1.3.22.1.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.18.1.7.
1.3.22.1.2.1.4. Con: The original claim states "All drugs should be legalized." The literal interpretation of the claim is that there would not be any controls over which drugs can be sold.
1.3.22.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Although groceries such as meat or fruits are entirely legal, they are subject to certain quality standards and regulations controlled by authorities. Similar procedures could be easily established for drugs.
1.3.22.1.2.1.4.2. Con: That's just not true. Alcohol is legal, but no one would claim that there are no controls over how it can be sold. Alcohol is a drug. If anything this is splitting hairs over the definition of the word 'drug.' No one is suggesting we sell cyanide over the counter.
1.3.22.1.2.2. Con: Established companies selling drugs would almost certainly not engage in gun battles on the streets over "[turf](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Turf)".
1.3.22.1.2.3. Pro: Simply making all drugs legal would create a new big market niche exploited by resourceful pharmaceutical companies that could synthesize new, highly addictive substances everyday. That would also render prescriptions useless.
1.3.22.1.2.3.1. Con: The [majority of drug users smoke a plant](http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/4508/TD0116918ENN.pdf) \(cannabis\), plants that anyone can grow and have a variety of medical uses. This would render a lot of perscription medicine unnecessary.
1.3.22.1.2.3.2. Con: Designer drugs already exist, are legal and work this angle.
1.3.22.1.2.3.3. Con: But since everything is legal, users can instead choose the drugs with the most benefits and the least harms.
1.3.22.1.2.3.4. Con: People would prefer less addicting drugs, so as to lessen the risk of taking them. This would lead to companies to develop _less_ addicting drugs as well.
1.3.22.1.2.3.5. Con: Selling harmful products is a poor long-term business strategy, as can be seen with tobacco companies. It only works as long as there is uncertainty in their harms. When the harms become apparent, people will take measures to stop using it as well as take measures to stop others from using it.
1.3.22.1.2.3.5.1. Con: The tobacco industry is still highly profitable with combined generated profits of [$35 billion](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/11/how-big-tobacco-has-survived-death-and-taxes) in 2016.
1.3.22.1.2.3.5.1.1. Con: However much of this revenue may be attributed to people who became addicted before they were aware of the negative health consequences. Also, the consequences of smoking are slow and not always visible; this means people are not as aware of them. But the consequences can be made obvious through legal packaging requirements and health campaigns.
1.3.22.1.2.3.5.1.2. Con: Tobacco companies are investing in and moving to different technologies \(vaping\) as the population becomes more aware of the harms and less prone to tobacco smoking. They can tell tobacco smoking is ultimately a ‘sinking ship’ for their profits.
1.3.22.1.2.3.5.2. Con: Pharmaceutical companies could double their revenues by selling harmful and addictive drugs to begin with and subsequently curing medication.
1.3.22.1.2.3.6. Con: They might just as well synthesize new, less addictive and harmful drugs.
1.3.22.1.2.3.6.1. Con: The syntheses for many illicit, addictive and recreational drugs is already known, there would be high amounts of money spent on R&D for new less addictive drugs.
1.3.22.1.2.3.6.2. Con: All drugs which cause a pleasurable reward response to the user act on the Ventral-Tegmental Area, a dopamine pathway in the brain which mediates both pleasure and causes addiction. Any drug that is made to be less addictive is inherently less amicable to drug abusers. [Textbook: Rang & Dale](https://studentconsult.inkling.com/read/rang-dale-pharmacology-ritter-flower-henderson-7th/chapter-48/table-48-1)
1.3.22.1.2.3.6.2.1. Con: There are other aspects that make drugs addicting as well. For example the severity of withdrawal.
1.3.22.1.2.3.6.2.2. Con: Drugs may also alter the strength of which learning \(permanent changes of neural activity\) reacts to such rewards.
1.3.22.1.2.3.6.3. Con: While it might be better for society if a corporation created a less addictive drug, the actual incentive would be to create the most addictive drug imaginable. The corporation would then patent this to own a monopoly and charge a huge amount for continued use.
1.3.22.1.2.4. Con: Name one beer company or tobacco company that has openly killed anyone to continue selling their product. There will be the enticement of organize crime, rackets, and monopolies though.
1.3.22.1.2.5. Pro: Legalising all drugs may give private companies incentives to advertise/promote the use of those, hence increase the overall drug use.
1.3.22.1.2.6. Pro: A lack of visible violence doesn't mean that in the long run people wouldn't get hurt, perhaps more considering the effects of the [global financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007–2008) are still felt today. The global financial crisis was mainly due to big companies operating on their own will.
1.3.22.1.2.6.1. Pro: An intuitive assumption is that criminals are unethical, while law-abiding citizens are ethical. This is a false assumption. Recent history is littered with examples of corporations pursuing profits through appalling actions, all the while keeping within the letter of the law. Examples include tobacco companies [suppressing health information](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/03/opinion/philip-morris-lashes-back.html), banks deliberately making loans to borrowers [knowing they would default](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis), and casinos' [purposeful exploitation](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/12/losing-it-all/505814/) of gambling addicts.
1.3.22.1.3. Pro: By legalizing drugs, the drug cartels will quickly cease to exist, saving thousands of lives.
1.3.22.1.3.1. Con: If drug cartels are able to offer drugs at cheaper prices than legal retailers, people will continue to buy from them and the problem will not be resolved.
1.3.22.1.3.1.1. Con: Drugs are mostly expensive because they are illegal.
1.3.22.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Cheap drugs means more drugs for the same money, which could lead to more addiction problems.
1.3.22.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Sensible legal drug policy would uses taxes to keep prices equal or slightly below current black market prices to keep that from occuring.
1.3.22.1.3.1.2. Con: Even if criminals are able to offer drugs at lower prices, people would turn to legal drugs because they would not risk prison and they would be sure of the quality of what they're buying.
1.3.22.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: The law regulation of the drug's market will standardize the quality of the products, and their safety, creating incentives for the consumers to prefer to deal in the legal market.
1.3.22.1.3.1.3. Con: It's always going to be cheaper to produce a product legally. Legal producers don't have to worry about having their stuff stolen by police and can do all their transactions in the legal market which is much more efficient and cheaper.
1.3.22.1.3.1.4. Con: As long as the taxes don't surpass the higher costs of the black market businesses, there is no reason to believe that legal drugs would be more expensive.
1.3.22.1.3.1.5. Con: The black market businesses won't be able to invest in productivity-increasing \(especially immovable\) capital, as the threat of being caught discourages such investments.
1.3.22.1.3.1.6. Pro: The only reason for black market chemicals to be cheaper, is that the black market doesn't care about patents and IP.
1.3.22.1.3.1.7. Con: If this was true, cartels would already be moving over to newer, patented pharmaceuticals, whose costs of production is dwarfed by market price already.
1.3.22.1.3.2. Con: Drug cartels will not cease their activities if drugs are legalised. They will simply move to other areas to keep their profits \(drugs for children, black market drugs, human trafficking\).
1.3.22.1.3.2.1. Con: If drugs are cheap and of good quality, there will be no need for people to buy them on the black market.
1.3.22.1.3.2.2. Con: Moving to another revenue source is not "simply done", criminal or otherwise. Drugs are insanely profitable at a relatively low level of effort, contrary to those other crimes you mentioned. It seems quite unlikely that a low level drug dealer will shift to trafficking human beings the moment drugs get legalised.
1.3.22.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Low-level drug dealers are not the ones causing the majority of harm, moving them out of the equation will only remove a level of abstraction from users to the gangs/cartels that actually create a danger to society.
1.3.22.1.3.2.3. Con: The fact that legalising drugs would not "end all crime" does not means that it would not damage criminal organizations. It's a step in the right direction to reduce their power.
1.3.22.1.3.2.4. Con: While drug cartels would move into other areas, it would still help drive down the profits they would make as people could get their drugs from legal reliable sources. Hence it may force the cartels to offer a purer product or less expensive to remain competitive.
1.3.22.1.3.3. Pro: If legal retailers can guarantee what they are selling then people will happily pay more.
1.3.22.1.3.4. Pro: Thousands of people are killed annually by drug cartels.
1.3.22.1.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.22.1.3.2.
1.3.22.1.3.5. Pro: Drug cartels destabilize Latin America. With legalization they would disappear and Latin America would gain stability.
1.3.22.1.3.5.1. Pro: [Mexico](https://www.globalresearch.ca/destabilizing-mexico/12707) has been destabilized by drug cartel activities such as lawlessness, kidnappings, increasing corruption and frequent assassinations.
1.3.22.1.3.5.2. Pro: Drug cartels would find the carpet pulled from underneath their feet and Latin American societies could resume progress after they were left frozen in time when the drug war began. Trillions of dollars spent, thousands of people killed and the cartels haven't even been dented. It's unwinnable, expensive, and keeps governments in check and corruption. In some cases, they cannot compete with the amount of money cartels move around.
1.3.22.1.3.6. Pro: Unlike companies operating in American borders, drug cartels use violence and threats thereof to increase market share.
1.3.22.1.3.7. Con: Criminals are not interested in drugs, their core interest is money. To gain the largest amount of money, in the quickest time, with the least effort, is their ultimate goal. Illegal drugs are a source to quick money, which criminals are willing to use violence to maintain their control of. Legalise all drugs, you take away the quick money and the violence that goes with it. Criminals will try and find a different source to achieve quick money.
1.3.22.1.4. Pro: As with the [legalization of prostitution in NSW](http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/issues/swedish_model/10reasons_07), legalising drugs would remove an important source of corruption in the police, the government, and the judiciary.
1.3.22.2. Con: -> See 1.3.22.1.3.2.
1.3.23. Con: Legalisation does not necessarily mean freely available. There would be different types and levels of regulation depending on the substance and its context of use.
1.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.12.2.1.
1.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.22.1.
1.6. Pro: People should be able to do whatever they choose to themselves, as long as this does not harm others.
1.6.1. Pro: Yes, all good drugs. Drug use should not be illegal - and the very best drugs should be easy to get, the highest of quality and reasonably priced. It is of absolutely no one's concern what people do to enhance their enjoyment of the now in this crazy existence so long as they are not hurting themselves or other people... and everything in moderation. Some people suck at doing drugs, they should not do them. Consequences for making poor choices while doing drugs should be strenuously enforced.
1.6.2. Con: Legalizing hard drugs would increase the probability of violence against the rest of the population.
1.6.2.1. Con: With good education on drugs. something that has to come with legalization, the risk of violence against others should not increase.
1.6.2.2. Con: This argument assumes that more people would take drugs after legalisation, which evidence suggests is not true.
1.6.2.3. Pro: Drug legalisation will make sexual assaults easier. [Drug facilitated sexual assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug-facilitated_sexual_assault).
1.6.2.3.1. Con: Most date rape drugs are already legally available. [Rohipnol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flunitrazepam), [GHB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Hydroxybutyric_acid), [ketamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine); the only drug unavailable legally is [MDMA \(Ecstacy\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16681170).
1.6.2.4. Con: A large portion of drug-related violence is directly caused by prohibition. All violence related to production, transportation and sales be gone if legalized. Crime and violence caused by prices inflated by law enforcement and an inefficient black market would also disappear.
1.6.2.5. Con: -> See 1.3.8.2.2.
1.6.3. Con: Some drugs are used on other people. Hypnotics are often employed to commit date rape. Controlling those substances may prevent date rape.
1.6.3.1. Con: The substances are controlled now. Current prohibition has not hindered the occurrence of date rape.
1.6.3.2. Con: Rape is already illegal.

Using legal drugs to rape someone is already illegal.
1.6.3.3. Con: That depends of the effectiveness of the control. It's currently not very effective.
1.6.3.4. Con: If you plan to drug someone with the intent of raping them, you're also able to get a hold of the something as ubiquitous as a benzodiazepine.
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.6.5. Pro: The right to bodily autonomy exists on the basis that individuals are best placed to know what is good for them and to ultimately make decisions about what happens to their bodies. The decision to take drugs should therefore rest solely with individuals.
1.6.5.1. Pro: This is a matter of fundamental Human Rights, the right to make a choice, to decide. People need empowerment to make informed and responsible decisions, hence, this isn't appealing to politicians who want people needing them, not empowered. Otherwise, they'll start questioning the need for these politicians. \(Please see: [Thomas Szasz "Our right to drugs"](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00221678950351004); this is a thought-provoking book, a must-read for this debate I think.\)
1.6.6. Con: Easy access to drugs could have serious harms for others in society, as people may drive under the influence or make other decisions with public consequences.
1.6.6.1. Con: Decriminalization would encourage the implementation of a broader scope of impairment detection devices. This would cause users to think twice about driving impaired on substances they believe wouldn't be detected using current methods.
1.6.6.2. Con: Legal access to drugs can be limited to adults in order to protect minors.
1.6.6.3. Con: Driving a car or operating machinery while under the influence can be made illegal.
1.6.7. Pro: Many drug experiences are positive, and current legislation prohibits taking part in them.
1.6.8. Pro: The government needs to stop trying to save us from ourselves. Using drugs is a victim-less crime and we should be able to make choices about our own bodies. Arrest the people who cause harm to others. After all, anyone who wants to get illegal drugs can \(and they do!\).
1.6.9. Pro: The Federal Government has no constitutional authority to regulate what citizens choose to put in their bodies. That is why a [Constitutional Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) had to be voted on for the prohibition of alcohol, which was later repealed as it was found to be unenforceable in any realistic way. Since that time, the Fed has abandoned it's delegated powers. If you disagree, then please show me where in the Constitution it says that the Government has the right to control what people ingest into their bodies.
1.6.9.1. Con: This discussion is not specific to America and the American constitution.
1.6.9.2. Con: This is merely an argument against the federal government's right to make drugs illegal. Constitutionally, the decision should fall to the states. Each state should be able to make all drugs illegal.
1.6.10. Pro: As long as the actions of the/an individual do not directly, or intentionally, affect any other individual, then that individual ought to have the right, and responsibility, to govern themselves, without interference from the community. However, if an individuals actions do, either directly, or intentionally, affect even one other individual; then the government ought to interfere to protect individuals from harming each other.
1.6.10.1. Pro: Any demonstrable harm to others, caused by the use/abuse of drugs, can be effectively dealt with in legal terms in context to the specific harm/damage verified by evidence. It's not necessary to criminalize a "secondary offense" on the chance that it might lead someone to actions harming others.
1.6.11. Con: They do harm others since this will incite other people, who do not know how to handle drugs and/or aren't smart and/or mature enough to try it.
1.6.12. Con: Individuals do not always consider the consequences of their actions and therefore should not be free to make all choices, given in some instances there could be very bad outcomes such as becoming addicted to hard drugs.
1.6.13. Pro: In a truly free society self regulation should be our privilege. You are free to not use drugs, you should be just as free to use them. Adults in a free society being imprisoned over drugs is barbaric, unenlightened and lacks compassion.
1.6.14. Con: An addict is not free to use or not use their drug. Addictive drugs increasingly reduce one's ability to do without them, therefore they are not a simple matter of freedom because they can inhibit that very thing. One should not be 'free' to end their own freedom.
1.6.14.1. Pro: Lots of drug addicts don't want to use drugs, but they can't just simply choose to stop using drugs, because they have an addiction.
1.6.14.2. Con: Under current laws, these people are being punished for something that this claim suggests they are unable to refrain from doing. If it's not a choice, then we shouldn't punish people for it. Removing the threat of punishment would also encourage people to get treatment.
1.6.15. Pro: No plant-based substance should be illegal hence all plants should be legal. We are a part of nature as one so are these plants. No one has the right to decide for all.
1.6.15.1. Con: Imported plants can destabilize the ecosystem. Some plants can cause harm to humans and animals alike. Fighting or outlawing some plants is a reasonable thing to do.
1.6.15.2. Con: Being part of nature is not insurance against harm, quite the opposite. One of the primary aspects of inter-special relationships is one of harm, plants included. There are thousands of plants that are completely unsafe to ingest, and this number greatly expands when one includes refined extracts \(as this intensifies the effects of otherwise safe dosages\)
1.6.16. Con: It is well [documented](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3725219/) that emotional [harm](https://www.promises.com/resources/addiction-articles/social-effects-alcoholism/) comes to the loved ones of people using drugs and [alcohol](https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/journals-and-magazines/social-policy-journal/spj37/37-family-functioning-in-families-with-alcohol-and-other-drug-addiction.html).
1.6.16.1. Pro: Addictions can lead to improper care of children, relatives, or any person \(even animals\) who depends on the user.
1.6.16.1.1. Con: This is undeniable, however, because legal status has no bearing on this, this effect of drug use has no bearing on the discussion.
1.6.16.1.2. Con: Drug use is not the same as drug addiction.
1.6.16.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.18.1.10.1.
1.6.16.2. Con: This is only true in the case of people whose drug use either causes them to become dangerous or interferes with their lives. Both of these scenarios would be better treated by legalizing drug use. A heroin addict is much more likely to get help if they don't have to hide.
1.6.17. Con: When a person is choosing a behavior they believe to be only harmful to themselves, they inadvertently also harm others.
1.6.17.1. Pro: It can cause psychological stress on a sensible person relative to the user, even with soft drugs.
1.6.17.1.1. Con: You are not responsible for other people's feelings.
1.6.17.1.2. Con: Some people may become psychologically stressed about a friend/relative coming out as gay, or an atheist as well. That doesn't mean the friend/relative did anything wrong.
1.6.17.1.3. Con: Such stress might be irrational, especially when it's related to unproblematic drug use. In that case, the psychological stress is the fault of the persons irrational beliefs.
1.6.17.1.4. Con: Someone's elevated stress levels alone, isn't a good enough justification to limit other peoples freedom by force.
1.6.17.1.5. Con: Psychological stress to relatives is exacerbated by the fact that users put themselves in legal danger.
1.6.17.2. Pro: Children are at risk of becoming inadvertently harmed by their parents smoking tobacco, even when parents don't smoke in their children's presence, if the parent's life expectancy was reduced.
1.6.17.3. Con: If a person does harm to others then he or she should be held responsible for that harm.
1.6.17.3.1. Pro: Making it clear that you are responsible for your behavior, regardless of your level of intoxication, will increase the likelihood of taking reasonable precautions ahead of time.
1.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.12.4.
1.8. Con: Some drugs, barbiturates in particular, are used maliciously as date-rape drugs. Control of these drugs may prevent rapes from occurring.
1.8.1. Con: There is nothing "controlled" about a drug that has been [gifted to criminal cartels](https://iea.org.uk/blog/prohibitions-create-black-markets-and-cause-violent-crime) to manufacture and distribute.
1.8.2. Con: Benzodiazepines are readily available in most countries for common complaints like insomnia, jet lag and performance anxiety, and are actually more effective at increasing the effects of alcohol than barbiturates.
1.8.3. Con: If someone is willing to commit an act as vile as date raping someone, they're probably not going to care very much about whether they have to purchase the drug illegally.
1.8.4. Pro: Currently, obtaining such drugs is risky, restricted and requires work. Even if they're available, making them freely available may increase incidence of rape.
1.8.4.1. Con: The issue with these drugs is that it's possible for someone to ingest it unknowingly, after someone dropped them in their drink etc. This isn't possible with the most popular date rape drug alcohol, at least not in higher doses, as it's taste is quite unmistakable. One solution for recreational availability of such drugs could be to require that they emit an unmistakable coloring or odour/taste when dissolved in a drink.
1.8.4.1.1. Pro: This could also make this use of such drugs harder when legalized, as all production of the drugs would include this property.
1.8.4.2. Con: Drugging and raping someone is way more risky than buying illegal drugs.
1.8.4.3. Con: -> See 1.3.23.
1.8.4.4. Con: On the other hand, drugs that are produced illegally are more harmful as there is no control over their content and production process. So it would be better to receive legal drugs than illegal ones.
1.8.5. Con: Legalizing them, will bring this - which is already an issue as these drugs are commonly available with a prescription even now - issue further into the public eye, facilitate better education, help with recognition of symptoms and prevention as well as possibly help develop better and more effective legislation against the misuse of drugs in this way.
1.8.5.1. Con: The cost of bringing date rape into the public eye using this method is knowingly allowing for an exponential increase in the ease of raping someone \(and with it a likely increase in rapes\). It would be better to address the underlying social issues which lead to rapes before potentially increasing the ease of access to drug which facilitate rape.
1.8.6. Con: Legalizing drugs does not imply you may use them on someone without their permission. It's already illegal to give someone else a narcotic they were not prescribed, even though the drug itself is legal.
1.8.7. Con: Illegally acquired date rape drugs are more likely to increase the danger to the target. If I was unlucky enough to be drugged without my knowledge, I would prefer drugs that were not sourced from criminals.
1.8.8. Pro: The ability to alter another person's mind state has incredible potential for abuse, and utter manipulation. This would be a use that drastically increased people's abilities to infringe on the freedom of other people should they wish it.
1.8.8.1. Con: Drugging someone against their will still would be a crime. To a person willing to go that far it would not make a big difference whether the drug is legal or not.
1.8.8.2. Con: A victim of such an act would not fear prosecution for consumption if drugs were legal, and therefore would more easily seek and obtain help and/or retribution.
1.8.9. Pro: Producers and distributors are not able to control how consumers use their products, therefore legalising the sales and possession of drugs necessarily would allow for this kind of abuse to increase easily despite the illegality of forcing another person to ingest them.
1.8.10. Pro: Legalising "all drugs" may be too generic of a statement. What is meant is probably "recreational drugs". Dangerous substances such as poison and "rape-drugs" may be better off left illegal.
1.8.10.1. Con: "Rape-drug" is a name derived from the wrong usage of a particular drug. The act of raping is already illegal.
1.8.10.2. Con: Some recreational drugs could also be used as date-rape drugs, such as ketamine.
1.8.11. Con: Legal methods of acquiring such drugs can be made traceable, making it possible to [track sources](http://theconversation.com/why-you-have-to-show-id-to-buy-cold-and-flu-tablets-2173) without [costly and unpredicatable](http://www.popcenter.org/Responses/sting_operations/3/#endref15) undercover operations.
1.8.11.1. Con: Tracing the rapist after the rape does not undo the rape itself, so the harm was already made. Tracing him before the rape rules out the purpose if even selling it, to begin with.
1.8.12. Con: This argument is based on semantics.
1.9. Pro: Drug decriminalisation in [Portugal](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/05/portugals-radical-drugs-policy-is-working-why-hasnt-the-world-copied-it) appears to have been successful; particularly in reducing overdoses, infections and drug related crime.
1.9.1. Pro: [In 2017](https://www.kialo.com/all-drugs-should-be-legalized-7100/7100.0=7100.1+7100.297), there were more direct deaths from alcohol consumption than from drug consumption. \(Source is in Portuguese; please use translate\)
1.9.2. Pro: [Decriminalization works.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/portugal-decriminalised-drugs-14-years-ago-and-now-hardly-anyone-dies-from-overdosing-10301780.html) Look at Portugal they decriminalized everything in 2001 and now they have 3 over doses a year per every million citizens.
1.9.3. Con: Drug decriminalisation in Portugal has increased numbers of drug addicts, cocaine use, for example, has more than doubled between 2001-2007. [Institute for Drug and Drug Addiction \(IDT, I.P.\) \(Portugal\)](https://web.archive.org/web/20110725093536/http://www.idt.pt/PT/IDT/Documents/Ponto_Focal/2009_NationalReport.pdf)
1.9.3.1. Con: Total negative consequences of drug use might still be lower, despite a rise in use.
1.10. Pro: The legalisation of drugs could mean that they are taken more safely and cautiously than in the current environment.
1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.18.1.1.
1.10.2. Pro: The person who has been taking drugs and is scared to go to hospital if something bad is happening because what they have done is illegal. For this to be legal, the individual will be more likely to go to hospital if they are having some bad effects from the drug or need help.
1.10.3. Pro: The risk of poor-quality or fake drugs would be minimised.
1.10.3.1. Pro: We would know the ingredients, removing the risk of taking laced or counterfeit drugs which can cause further harm.
1.10.3.1.1. Pro: Many [deaths](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-24581947) attributed to ecstasy \(or MDMA\) use are actually caused by other, unwanted ingredients.
1.10.3.2. Con: Legalisation of cigarettes [did not stop](https://thedebrief.co.uk/news/real-life/1-every-7-british-cigarettes-contraband-counterfeit/) illicit and poor quality cheaper versions.
1.10.3.2.1. Con: The evidence provided in this claim stems largely from importing cheaper cigarettes from the rest of Europe to the UK. The difference in quality is probably minimal.
1.10.3.2.2. Con: Cigarettes are overpriced to discourage use because they are so harmful. Many currently illegal drugs are a [lot less addictive and harmful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_harmfulness#/media/File:HarmCausedByDrugsTable.svg) and there is less need to discourage their use.
1.10.3.3. Pro: During prohibition of alcohol beverages between 1920 and 1930 in the US, the drinks faced scarcity, higher prices, higher alcoholic percentages and lower quality in taste
1.10.3.4. Pro: People who want to use drugs are largely already able to get access to them, but can have no assurance about their safety or quality. Government regulations could resolve this problem.
1.10.3.5. Pro: Evidence suggests that the high mortality rate of heroin users in the USA is due to fentanyl, a much stronger version of heroin that can easily lead to overdose. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/05/upshot/opioid-epidemic-drug-overdose-deaths-are-rising-faster-than-ever.html)
1.10.3.6. Con: If government regulations lead to drugs being expensive, it is possible people will still try to access cheaper drugs on a black market and these drugs may still be dangerous or of poor quality.
1.10.3.6.1. Con: In Australia, alcohol is already [made expensive by regulation](http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/why-do-we-pay-so-much-for-alcohol/news-story/1647c23acc476553ade5d77774b8fa7d). However, black markets for alcohol are rare. Therefore we would expect that black markets for other regulated drugs would also be rare, provided that these drugs were as available as alcohol.
1.10.3.6.2. Con: This is essentially an argument against unregulated drugs. Therefore we should regulate. Furthermore, having the option to buy regulated drugs is surely better than only having the blackmarket option.
1.10.3.7. Con: Drugs may be adulterated despite legalisation, like alcoholic beverages
[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20959682)
1.10.3.8. Pro: Cheap [substitutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desomorphine#Toxicity_of_%22krokodil%22) like krokodil cause severe health problems. If drugs were legal and cheaper, substitutes lose popularity.
1.10.3.9. Pro: Drugs being legalized would allow the injured victims \(or their heirs\) of fraudulently/irresponsibly cut/marketed drugs to legally and publicly sue the manufacturer/distributor for damages, thereby using market pressures to better assure product/service quality/safety.
1.10.4. Pro: The legalisation of drugs could lead to better education on how to be safe around them.
1.10.4.1. Con: Education on how to be safe with drugs can be seen as an incentive to use them.
1.10.4.1.1. Con: Research shows that education has helped the [decrease](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/26/cigarette-smoking-decline_n_6855468.html) in number of tobacco smokers.
1.10.4.2. Pro: Countries that have legalized or decriminalized most drugs have seen significant drop in addiction, and associated deaths.
1.10.4.3. Pro: Information about the content of legalized drugs would be easier to find and accurate which would help people do informed and safer choice.
1.10.4.4. Pro: Currently, many "information campaigns" about drugs are ridiculous, badly done propaganda. If a person is being lied to while also being told drugs are bad, they might think the opposite is true.
1.10.4.5. Con: Legalizing drugs should not be a prerequisite for better education.
1.10.4.6. Pro: These would be funded by taxes on the drugs themselves.
1.10.4.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.12.2.1.
1.10.5. Pro: There's a possibility that there'd be less need for people to binge on substances due to abundance, in the same way adults enjoy a glass or two of wine.
1.10.5.1. Pro: We could educate people with factual data in order to promote responsible, safer use.
1.10.6. Con: This could lead individuals into a false sense of safety when it comes to drug use.
1.10.6.1. Con: Making things safer is always preferable.
1.10.6.2. Con: When in safer environments and with safer drugs the risks of serious overdoes leading to injury or death are greatly reduced.
1.10.6.3. Con: Making things safer is applies to all users, while false sense of safety only applies to a minority.
1.10.7. Pro: When obtaining drugs legally people can be sure that the drugs are pure and accurately measured. With the illegal drug market drugs are often miss sold, inaccurately measured or cut with other substances.
1.10.7.1. Pro: It's important to have a standardized quantity of an active substance of controlled quality to prevent overdosing or unwanted effects.
1.10.7.2. Pro: This alone. Shooting heroin is like playing Russian roulette every time: if a batch is too strong, goodbye!
1.10.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.18.1.1.
1.10.8. Pro: Legal regulation creates a market which can be adjusted and controlled to the needs of the individual and society  - These options are not availlable with prohibition.
1.10.9. Pro: Giving a legal framework to the use of certain drugs may help to prevent the development of infectious diseases. As an example, one may think about the development of HIV which was supported by the illegal consumption of heroin, made without any satisfactory hygiene conditions.
1.10.10. Pro: Currently, designer drugs posing as known substances, or being dosed wrongly cause a lot of the harm associated with drug use, legalization of substances with known characteristics would mean less harmful drugs are being used.
1.10.10.1. Pro: The drugs that people want and find more dangerous designer substitutes, for the most part, are cocaine, opium, and cannabis. Legalizing these three categories is all that needs to be done. They provide a safer way to get the sought-after effects. They have for tens of thousands of years. \(They only became illegal when people realized they could politicize them for profit and demonizing minorities. All this under the banner of absolute morality I might add.\)
1.11. Con: The legalisation of drugs may well lead to children trying and becoming involved with drugs at a younger age.
1.11.1. Pro: If drugs are legalised, children might think that doing drugs is ok.
1.11.1.1. Con: Doing drugs, by itself, can be ok. Alcohol and nicotine are widely accepted in western society, and yet can both be considered dangerous drugs. This argument is paternalistic.
1.11.1.2. Con: Many activities are restricted to adults only, children are able to understand that. Children are influenced far more by their family, friends and the media they consume than anything a government says.
1.11.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.11.1.4. Con: Because drug use is typically against the rules, some people, especially teenagers, take drugs for the thrill of breaking the rules.
1.11.1.5. Con: Kids should learn right from wrong from their parents and communities/churches. What is lawful isn't always right \(for example: adultery\).
1.11.1.6. Con: All the states that have legalized marijuana in the USA report a decrease in use for kids ages 12-17, the [lowest](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/11/following-marijuana-legalization-teen-drug-use-is-down-in-colorado/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.03d773e94a79) of the decade. This [data](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics) can be found in the national drug survey from 2017 in the United States.
1.11.1.7. Con: Children would think about doing drugs the same way they currently think about smoking, thanks to laws and ads against it.
1.11.1.7.1. Pro: Places that have legalised or decriminalised marijuana do not show an increase in youth marijuana users.
1.11.1.8. Con: -> See 1.3.12.3.2.
1.11.2. Pro: Legal drugs will likely make it a lot easier for young people to get access to them.
1.11.2.1. Pro: Some adults may sell drugs to underaged people to make profit.
1.11.2.1.1. Con: That's exactly what we have today.
1.11.2.1.2. Con: Since adults would prefer the legal market, these people would have to base their entire business on selling to underaged people. This would make it drastically less profitable, as well as easier to expose by police.
1.11.2.1.3. Con: Since these would most likely be legally bought products, it would be much easier for the authorities have control over it, as opposed to illegally produced and smuggled goods.
1.11.2.1.4. Con: In that case, a bigger fraction of transactions on the black market would go to underaged people than now. Because selling to underaged people is much more serious than tax avoidance or unlicensed selling, this would incentivize the police to go after dealers.
1.11.2.2. Pro: Young people could use fake IDs to buy drugs, the same way they currently do with alcohol and cigarettes.
1.11.2.2.1. Con: Using a fake ID in a legal establishment implies much more work and risk than just buying from the unregulated black market.
1.11.2.2.2. Con: This is only a viable strategy for some individuals whom are already close to the legal age, as opposed to a much younger person buying from other young people recruited by the black market.
1.11.2.3. Con: Illegal drug dealers typically require no age verification from their clients. 
Legal drugs would require ID to buy thus making them harder for teens to aquire.
1.11.2.4. Con: Legal sellers will be highly scrutinized and won't want to risk losing their license.
1.11.3. Con: Legalization of a drug means more education for children in this matter.
1.11.4. Con: Legalisation of all drugs, gives the possibility to control the age group of people participating in the drugs.
1.11.4.1. Pro: Assuming that drugs will still be legally forbidden for people under a certain age, the distribution points will not be allowed to sell it to children.
1.11.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.11.2.2.
1.11.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.11.2.1.
1.11.4.1.3. Pro: As shown in the Netherlands, the risk of losing their business licence is a great way of making sure legal sellers don't sell to kids.
1.11.5. Con: Becoming involved with drugs is going to become harder for children because they will be denied access to the legal market and there will be drastically less demand, and thus supply, and thus availability for black market drugs. It also means there will be less demand for young people as workers in the black market as well.
1.11.6. Con: When weed was legalized in Colorado for recreational use, the usage rate among for teen and children stayed the same. [Source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colorado-marijuana-idUSKCN0Z702N).
1.11.7. Pro: [The victims of drug abuse](https://www.nap.edu/resource/18331/childabuseneglect-rb2.pdf) are often children, who can not help themselves. They frequently end up neglected, starving, and accidentally overdosing on available drugs.
1.11.7.1. Con: If you leave your medical cabinet open and within reach of children, they can overdose from anything, for instance, grandma's heart drops. It has happened in the past and will happen in the future if children are not educated about the dangers of prescription drugs by their parents or in school.
1.11.7.2. Con: That is not an effect of drugs. It can be argued that the neglect of children living with addicted parents is caused by the lack of welfare and safety net, and its effect can probably be lessened if addictions are treated as a healthcare problem.
1.11.8. Con: Some of the appeal to rebellious teens IS the fact that drug use is illegal. Treating moderated drug use as a normalized behaviour and treating addiction/ binge use as a disease takes much of the "cool" factor away.
1.11.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.12.6.3.
1.12. Con: Drug usage increases drastically among the poor and socially marginalized. Which in turn makes their condition worse. So legalizing all drugs would lead to much larger societal rifts.
1.12.1. Pro: Many types of drugs are associated with withdrawal from societal life; affected people tend to come from families with unstable backgrounds.
1.12.2. Con: Most [drug users](http://theconversation.com/many-people-use-drugs-but-heres-why-most-dont-become-addicts-35504) can rely on supportive networks and loving families.
1.12.3. Con: In fact, the [majority](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/habits-most-drug-users-are-happy-successful-people-with-a-taste-for-the-good-life-1292155.html) of young individuals consuming illegal substances lead fulfilling and successful lives.
1.12.4. Pro: There is a high level of correlation between [poverty](https://borgenproject.org/addiction-poverty-connected/) and substance abuse.
1.12.4.1. Con: A high level of correlation does not indicate which of the variables is the cause and which is the effect.
1.12.5. Con: Part of the burden comes from the outrageous street price. When people are only spending coffee prices to get their fix, the social implications drop drastically.
1.12.6. Con: A large reason for this is due to individuals dealing with poverty resorting to selling drugs and therefore introducing them to low-income communities. By regulating the sale of these substances, gangs and other criminal organizations in low income areas will make less money as people turn to the legal option, becoming weaker and their presence and hold on low income areas should be reduced.
1.12.7. Con: Regulated, corporate or government sale of these substances should not "target" low income areas and take advantage of disadvantaged people in the same way that current gangs, criminal organizations and other drug dealers currently do.
1.12.8. Con: The criminalization of drug use is the major agitator of the economic rifts caused by drug use: illegal drug use leads to arrests which lead to arrest records and the socially imposed inability to self-produce wealth.
1.12.8.1. Pro: Based on countries that have already done this like [Portugal](https://borgenproject.org/decriminalization-of-drugs-in-portugal/) there is not shown to be an increase in drug use in the poor population, or at all. Prohibition and persecution of the poor for drug use is a big part of why the drug use currently leads to making their condition worse. Legalization and ideally treatment support instead of criminal records for the poor would help lead to smaller social rifts.
1.13. Pro: Prisons would not be "too full" to hold \(violent\) offenders.
1.13.1. Pro: Additionally, if drugs were able to be obtained legally, and more help was available for those struggling with addiction, it could be assumed that drug-related violent crimes and all crimes relating to the illegal drug trade would be cut down as well ultimately reducing the number of incarcerated individuals. A large percentage of violent crimes as well as crimes including robbery and theft are drug related.[Statistics on Drug Related Violent Crimes](https://www.bjs.gov/content/dcf/duc.cfm)
1.13.2. Pro: The War on Drugs has led to the mass incarceration of American citizens, and black and brown people are disproportionately targeted by law enforcement. [drugpolicy.org](http://www.drugpolicy.org/issues/race-and-drug-war)
1.13.2.1. Pro: Although white youth use drugs more than their non-white peers, the[incarceration rates](https://www.alternet.org/drugs/stereotype-shattered-new-study-finds-white-youth-are-more-likely-blacks-abuse-hard-drugs) of drug-related crimes in the second group are way higher.
1.13.2.2. Con: This is because the US prison system is [privately owned.](https://smartasset.com/mortgage/the-economics-of-the-american-prison-system) Incentive structures mean that running prisons can only be profitable with high rates of incarceration.
1.13.3. Con: This is an argument against incarceration for drug related crimes, not for the outright legalisation of drugs.
1.13.4. Pro: The problem is not the drugs themselves, but their illegality. Illegality drives up the price, and that causes criminality among users who need to gain enough money to buy them.
1.14. Pro: Many drugs have good medical properties, legalization would allow science to research these properties and cure different patients.
1.14.1. Con: Science can already study drugs, just with some constraints.
1.14.1.1. Con: Removing some of these constraints through the legalisation of drugs could make studies more successful.
1.14.1.2. Pro: Federal government does not, historically, allow research projects aimed at anything other than addiction research; Research which is designed to support the government prohibition.  [www.usatoday.com](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/08/18/feds-limit-research-marijuana-medical-use/31547557/)
1.14.1.3. Pro: Legalization of recreational drug use is not necessary for legalization of expanded drug research.
1.14.2. Pro: When it is legal then the studies can become more transparent and have more effectiveness globally.
1.14.3. Pro: Studies suggest that certain hallucinogens have long term effects on behaviour, [rehabilitating criminals](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/world/americas/a-hallucinogenic-tea-time-for-some-brazilian-prisoners.html) and [treating depression](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/13/magic-mushrooms-reboot-brain-in-depressed-people-study). For decades, these studies have been prevented by legislation.
1.14.4. Con: Some drugs are [allergens](https://www.healthline.com/health/allergic-to-marijuana#diagnosis). Further study is needed before considering legalizing them.
1.14.4.1. Con: Almost any substance can be an allergen. This should not prevent usage in medicine or consumption by people who are not allergic.
1.14.5. Pro: Legalization will make it easier for researchers to study how different illicit drugs affect our brain and thereby advance our understanding of neuroscience.
1.14.6. Pro: Drugs declared schedule 1 are nearly impossible to do research on due to the very limited number of researchers able to work with these compounds because of the stringent requirements and lengthy processes associated approval for this kind of research. This limits what we know about these compounds as well as to what length we are able to develop treatments for those struggling with addiction \(physical and mental\) as well as treatment for acute toxicity.
1.14.7. Pro: The Controlled Substances Act [dea.gov](https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml), prohibits Schedule 1 substances \(such as Cannabis\), which forces patients to either break the law or use more harmful/addictive substances that are inferior medicine.
1.14.8. Pro: The outright scheduling on any mind-altering chemical compounds halts progress in the scientific community, restricting the research behind legal walls and harming potential breakthrough medications in not on the mental health side of things \(LSD, Psilocybin, MDMA\). But as we have seen physical breakthroughs too, with cannabis.
1.15. Pro: Drug prohibition has been used as a racist policy to mass incarcerate people of color.
1.15.1. Con: This is a totally USA centered argument. \(From a European view I wonder if even a discussion subject exists with the impossibility to mount "race" and "supremacy" subjects into it\) There are plenty of countries such as Afghanistan, Russia, China, Japan, and many more, where this argument meaningless.
1.15.2. Con: Drug prohibition might be inspired by some kind of racism but abandoning it would not necessarily mean an improvement of the situation for those incarcerated or addicted to drugs. It is unknown if legalisation of drugs would mean the American government is less racist as there are still many other systematic issues unrelated to drug prohibition.
1.15.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.2.
1.15.4. Pro: Drug use shouldn't suffer as a result of this behaviour. Supremacist or racist governments will find [other reasons](https://pictorial.jezebel.com/rediscovered-texas-cemetery-contains-remains-of-dozens-1827749137), just 'loitering' was good enough to go to a hard labour camp forever in the 1920s.
1.16. Pro: Drug use will not cease regardless of the legality.
1.16.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.16.2. Pro: There are several different [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_models_of_human_drug_use) explaining drug consumption evolutionarily, e.g. the Sexual Selection Hypothesis, and thus as part of human nature.
1.16.2.1. Con: This is an appeal to nature fallacy. Nature is not the word on what ought to be done with it's products.
1.16.3. Con: Drug use might not cease, however limiting the availability of drugs should reduce the number of users.
1.16.3.1. Con: In the history of known humankind, limiting or prohibiting something never reduces the usage. It just takes it underground and out of public control.
1.16.3.2. Con: The demand for drugs is [inelastic](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/inelastic-demand.html), meaning it does not act according to the supply.
1.16.4. Pro: As important as harm-reduction is, health and drug-literacy are more important - the authority/state should not ever interfere with conscious, personal use without distribution intent. An addict is nonetheless an addict \(alcohol to heroin\), and child-protective services/health care personnel should at any time have the authority to intervene should ones drug-use influence surroundings or own health to a significant degree.
1.16.5. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.16.6. Con: The same could be said of murder despite it's illegality, yet this is not an argument employed for recommending the legalisation of murder. The law is an imperfect deterrent but an obvious deterrent nonetheless.
1.16.6.1. Con: It is already stated in this discussion, that drug use should be legalized under the term, that the drug-user is not endangering others by using drugs. So the comparison with such a serious crime as murder is a bit far-fetched.
1.16.7. Con: [Early data](https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/portugal-drug-decriminalization-statistics) out of Portugal looks promising. It may be that decriminalization dissuades those who specifically start using drugs as a way of breaking the law.
1.17. Pro: Without the effect of the forbidden fruit, drugs would not be cool anymore \(subcultures, arts, musicians, writers etc.\). That would minimize the usage because insecurity and wanting to belong somewhere.
1.17.1. Con: It would likely be cooler because companies can market the drugs like they do with cigarettes and alcohol.
1.17.2. Con: Looking at recent law changes in Canada I do not think your claim has proven to be correct. Given the legalisation, there are now big [shortages](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/canada-marijuana-legal-weed-shortage-pot-running-out-a8593861.html). Although this doesn't necessarily mean there's an increase, it's safe to say the use has not been minimized because the 'forbidden fruit' effect is absent.
1.17.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.8.
1.17.4. Con: "Fobidden fruit" is only part of why people take drugs. With cigarettes there are also people who smoke to belong.
1.18. Con: -> See 1.3.18.1.
1.19. Pro: Many currently illegal drugs make substantial positive contributions to human culture.
1.19.1. Con: Several 'great' artists have died from an overdose on drugs and thus actually causing negative contributions to human culture as the world is deprived of their 'artwork' \([27 club\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_Club).
1.19.2. Pro: Hallucinogens such as LSD and magic mushrooms have been used to create many great artworks.
1.19.2.1. Pro: LSD was a significant part of 60s rock and roll culture. It was taken by [Jimi Hendrix](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/03/king-lsd-sixties-pioneer-owsley-stanleys-colorful-legacy/348827/), [The Doors](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/doors-debut-album-10-things-you-didnt-know-115997/), and [the Beatles](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/beatles-sgt-pepper-at-50-john-lennons-accidental-getting-better-acid-trip-122596/) during the creation of the Sgt Pepper’s album, considered one of the greatest albums of all time.
1.19.2.2. Pro: Many poets have made works under the influence of drugs. For example, [the romantic poets used opium and the Beat poets used hallucinogens](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-lundberg/drugs-literature-poetry_b_1011124.html)
