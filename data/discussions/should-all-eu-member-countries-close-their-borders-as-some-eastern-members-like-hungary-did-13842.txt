Discussion Title: Should all EU-member countries close their borders as some Eastern members, like Hungary did?

1. All EU-member countries should close their external borders \(which are next to non-EU member countries\) as some Eastern members \(like Hungary\) did.
1.1. Con: Europe would suffer internationally as it would not be seen as beacon of humanitarianism anymore.
1.1.1. Con: The USA does the same, closing its borders, yet, it suffers no harm. Aside pro-immigration EU members, no countries allow foreigners to enter illegally there without any punishment.
1.1.1.1. Con: Right wing policies of Trump cause a resurgence of [anti-Americanism](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/9372/trump-europe-anti-americanism) in Europe.
1.1.2. Pro: [Germany](http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-migrant-help-20150907-story.html) was internationally credited for its decision to accept Syrian refugees.
1.1.3. Pro: Europe has a lot of [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power). This will vanish once it is seen as yet another self-oriented power.
1.1.4. Con: Aside some bad reputation within some liberal-led countries, closing our borders would cause no harm for Europe.
1.1.5. Pro: People drowning in the Mediterranean Sea because of FRONTEX actions is bad publicity.
1.1.5.1. Con: The problem is not FRONTEX, but the hope that they will be accepted if they cross the sea. If they wouldn't have this hope and wouldn't try the way through the sea, they couldn't drown into it.
1.2. Con: Illegal immigration can be fought without physically closing a border.
1.2.1. Con: The Hungarian example shows us that closing our borders makes our fight against illegal immigration more effective.
1.2.1.1. Con: This has happened only because other countries have taken the load off of Hungarian Immigration System.
1.3. Con: Physically sealing all borders of European member states would be costly.
1.3.1. Con: Nobody denies it, but sealing all borders would cost less than accepting illegal immigrants and paying after them.
1.4. Pro: Closing our borders is less expensive than handling the waves of illegal immigration.
1.4.1. Con: Immigration generally [pays off](https://www.oecd.org/migration/OECD%20Migration%20Policy%20Debates%20Numero%202.pdf) economically.
1.4.2. Pro: Because of FRONTEX border protection is cheap for continental European states.
1.4.3. Pro: Germany spent up to [$20 billion](http://www.dw.com/en/germany-spent-20-billion-euros-on-refugees-in-2016/a-38963299) on refugees in 2016, compared to the [500 million](http://www.france24.com/en/20170901-hungary-wants-europe-funds-pay-border-fence-cut-migrant-flow) border wall Hungary built.
1.4.3.1. Con: The [first number](https://migrationdataportal.org/) was the spending on handling all the aspects the problem, the [second](http://www.iom.int/wmr/world-migration-report-2018) is to build a block to delegate the task to other countries \(which adds to the actual cost of the solution, not lowers it\).
1.5. Con: States at the border of Europe would have to cope with immigration into Europe alone.
1.6. Pro: If we accept too many people from different and sometimes even violent cultures, our European culture will be endangered.
1.6.1. Con: Since Hungary saw an influx of refugees in 2014 the overall [crime rate decreased](https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=19081) significantly.
1.6.1.1. Con: The crime rate in Hungary decreased because of the new laws and not because of immigration. There are almost no immigrants in Hungary now. During the influx, they were sent through the country and authorities made it easier for all of them to move. They caused some atrocities despite of this, and the government quickly closed its borders. Now there are no illegal immigrants in Hungary - and even in 2016, there were not even one thanks to a law that allowed illegals to be banned out from there.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Hungary's new Criminal Code was introduced in [2013](https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2015/241591.htm). A lowered crime rate after 2015 is thus not directly linked to new laws.
1.6.1.2. Con: Almost all the immigrants just passed trough the country on their way to Western Europe, so they don't influence Hungary's crime-rate statistics.
1.7. Pro: With illegal immigrants, a lot of criminals and even terrorists come into Europe, which makes accepting states unsafe. Closing our borders and only allowing real refugees to come in legally would make EU more safe, and also would keep out unwanted elements.
1.7.1. Con: Comparing urban areas in the [US](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/30/upshot/crime-immigration-myth.html), immigration has not impacted the crime rates.
1.8. Con: Hungary's policy works only because other countries are willing to take over, such as Greece, Italy and Spain who handle the bulk of refugees into the EU.
1.9. Pro: Those who came in illegally and were rejected, because they aren't real refugees will remain here, because it's almost impossible to take them back to their countries. These people can be easily fanatised, which will reise the possibility of new terrorist attacks in Europe.
1.9.1. Pro: After years of legal proceedings children born in the host country will be integrated and therefore their families cannot effectively be returned even if their asylum application was rejected.
1.9.2. Con: By closing the border those people would not magically cease to exist and stop standing at the borders. Closed borders do not fix the cause of the migration.
1.10. Pro: Migration is not a human right, therefore nobody has right to go illegally to another country. Closing borders is neccessary.
1.10.1. Con: A closed border would not only keep out immigrants, but also many people who do have the right to leave and enter countries in the EU.
1.10.2. Con: This is false according to articles of the UN Charter of Human Rights.
Article 13 \(2\): "Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country."
Article 14 \(1\): "Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution."
1.11. Pro: The right of safety for European citizens is more important than the right of safety for illegal immigrants.
1.11.1. Con: Europe is getting [safer](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Crime_and_criminal_justice_statistics) over time. There is thus, nothing to worry about for European citizens.
1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.
1.12. Con: Many European countries need cheap labour for their economy, immigrants are necessary for this.
1.13. Pro: Following Hungary's example and closing our borders is the only way to differentiate real refugees from economical immigrants, criminals and terrorists before they arrive to our countries.
