Discussion Title: Is Cannibalism Ethically Permissible?

1. Human cannibalism is ethically permissible.
1.1. Con: Humans have evolved past needing to eat each other.
1.1.1. Con: Humans have not evolved to withstand starvation.
1.1.2. Pro: Humans live in groups and thus we are likely not to see other humans as food.
1.1.2.1. Con: Obviously, there are exceptions, therefore an ethical \(non-biological\) case still needs to be made.
1.1.3. Pro: Humans have developed advanced food production and preservation techniques.
1.1.4. Con: In emergency situations, humans revert back to a more instinctual level. Social evolution might not play a role in such situations.
1.1.4.1. Con: If that is the case, we're leaving the realm of ethics altogether. The purpose of ethics is to constrain instinctual drives of the individual to maximize the good of the society as a whole. Even in a situation where cannibalism is necessary, it is better to use an agreed-upon "ethical" rule-set for selection, rather than everyone reverting to individual survival instinct \(which would lead to even greater loss of life\).
1.1.4.2. Pro: This scenario is part of the human imagination, from Golding's Lord of the Flies to survival series like Lost or The Walking Dead.
1.1.5. Con: There are still open questions regarding whether humans even need to eat meat at all, however, on a purely biological evolutionary level there is little difference between human meat and other forms. The issue of ethics isn't so much about need or physical adaptations as it is about justification.
1.1.6. Con: Cannibalism is still considered acceptable practice for some [tribes](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/sleeping-with-cannibals-128958913/).
1.1.6.1. Con: The [Korowai](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/sleeping-with-cannibals-128958913/) believe the people they eat are not humans, but male witches called khakhua. They do not consider the practice cannibalism.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: A Smithsonian anthropologist described the system of eating khakua as part of the Korowai system of justice.
1.1.7. Pro: Animals of a same species usually don't eat each other.
1.1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.7.2. Con: The fact that animals of the same species don't usually eat each other doesn't necessarily make it ethically wrong for animals of the same species \(humans included\) to eat each other.
1.1.7.3. Con: Cannibalism is a common ecological interaction in the animal kingdom, and has been [recorded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism#cite_note-PolisThe-1) for more than 1,500 species.
1.1.8. Con: Humans have evolved past the need to eat animal meat, too, yet we still do.
1.1.8.1. Con: Some [humans](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/evolution-of-diet/?source=TruthAndBeauty) in non-developed areas rely on food in nature to survive, including meat from local animals.
1.2. Pro: If a person consents to or asks to be eaten, it should be permissible to act on this.
1.2.1. Pro: If a physically healthy person asked to be eaten after death, this would cause no harm.
1.2.1.1. Con: The wish to be eaten after death suggests a person may suffer from mental health issues.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: In a society where cannibalism is not taboo, the desire or acceptance to be eaten may be unrelated to mental health issues.
1.2.2. Con: People might give their consent in order to help their family out of poverty for instance. In a fundamentally unjust world, where the few have so much and the many so little, the freedom to make such a choice can not be allowed. It raises concerns similar to the organ trade.
1.2.2.1. Con: Protection from exploitation is different from a blanket rejection of personal autonomy. We have ways of determining whether or not a decision has been coerced in medicine, trade etc. While injustice can impair autonomy it is not clear that this is an insurmountable problem.
1.2.3. Pro: Human meat is a resource that should be used for the better of the planet and its inhabitants.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Some people would be willing to volunteer to be fattened up for meat in exchange for preferential treatment while alive \(like not having to work, eating whatever they want, having sex frequently, etc.\).
1.2.3.1.1. Con: Just because a person is willing does not mean the treatment that follows is ethically permissible or allowable.
1.2.3.2. Pro: In a world with hunger and global warming, partly due to the massive meat industry, cannibalism could be viewed as an ethical imperative to make the best of the resources we have.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Burying meat is a waste of meat. If we are to achieve a sustainable economy, human meat could help us use every last resource without damaging the planet.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: There are many societies in which food is scarce. Their situation could be improved by allowing the eating of human meat.
1.2.4. Con: Since the person eaten is no longer able to testify, consent may be falsified after the fact. Therefore allowing this would set an extremely dangerous precedent.
1.2.4.1. Con: If someone consented when alive, and then died, they would not be able to change their mind. There is no way consent is falsified. This is no different than following the wishes in someone's last will and testament.
1.2.4.2. Con: There are many ways in which people can give irrefutable consent, e.g. via video recording or sealed envelope to 3rd party \(notary\).
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: [Armin Meiwes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armin_Meiwes)' victim consented to be killed and eaten, which is documented on video.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: Meiwes was initially sentenced for manslaughter, not murder, because of the existing consensual agreement between the men.
1.2.4.2.1.2. Con: He was eventually convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, therefore what he did was not ethically permissible.
1.2.4.2.1.2.1. Con: A conviction such as this can not be a basis for an ethical argument. Ethics shape laws and not the other way around.
1.2.5. Pro: There is also a theoretical case of [self-cannibalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-cannibalism) \(eating one's own body parts\). Following the idea of self-ownership of the body, this should be considered completely ethical \(if done voluntarily\).
1.2.5.1. Pro: A Tokyo chef [served up](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/asexual-mao-sugiyama-cooks-serves-own-genitals_n_1543307?guccounter=1) his own severed genitals for $250 a plate.
1.2.6. Con: A person may not be aware of the consequences of this consent.
1.2.6.1. Con: Consent in its common usage is actually [informed consent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3777303/), which is by nature ethical.
1.2.6.2. Pro: We don't know how we might react before death until it happens, which suggest that you cannot give informed consent to be killed.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: The reaction to what was being consented to has no bearing on consenting. One can desire to be killed and still react negatively once faced with it.
1.2.6.3. Pro: That [failures](http://economicsonline.co.uk/Market_failures/Information_failure.html) happen because of a lack of information is observable in our economic system.
1.2.6.4. Pro: If people are allowed to consent to be killed and eaten, they may be subject to manipulation to trick them into consenting.
1.2.6.5. Con: It is common knowledge that death is the consequence of consenting to be eaten.
1.2.6.5.1. Con: You could consent to having only a part of your body eaten. This could be non-fatal.
1.2.6.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.2.7. Con: The person giving consent may not be in their usual frame of mind and would otherwise not have given consent.
1.2.8. Pro: Specific and even extravagant death wishes are often held in high regard in many cultures. It may have been very important for the dying person to be eaten after death.
1.2.9. Pro: As no 3rd party is being harmed during the act, it should be up to the consenting people involved to do whatever they want.
1.2.9.1. Pro: This is similar to painful sexual acts, which the people involved consented to and nobody else is being harmed by.
1.2.10. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.
1.2.11. Pro: Eating human meat is more ethical than alternatives because consent can be given.
1.2.12. Con: This can be considered [assisted suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_suicide#Legality_by_country), which is illegal in many countries.
1.2.12.1. Con: The fact that something is illegal, doesn't make it unethical.
1.2.13. Con: Human cannibalism may become a sexual fetish for some people.
1.2.13.1. Con: Virtually anything can be a fetish to some people. We can't just ban everything from our lives because some people have fetishes.
1.2.13.2. Pro: There is a similar sexual fetish that already exists. It is called [vorarephilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorarephilia).
1.2.13.3. Con: [Sexual cannibalism](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/dale-bolinger-guilty-what-is-sexual-cannibalism-9619716.html) is rather rare in humans, so it's unlikely that a significant number of people would develop such a fetish.
1.2.14. Con: It is not permissible to act on this in a state that has a [monopoly on violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence).
1.2.14.1. Con: The act of cannibalism itself is not violence, and is similar to cutting meat into smaller portions, chewing, and swallowing.  The state has no monopoly on the process of eating.
1.2.14.1.1. Con: A State cannot confirm the cause of death, once a person has been eaten.
1.2.14.1.1.1. Con: Cause of death can be established before releasing a corpse, whether for burial or consumption.
1.3. Pro: Dead people aren't harmed by having their bodies eaten. There is no victim in cannibalism.
1.3.1. Con: Legal systems are full of norms that punish mere behavior, even when it does not cause victims.
1.3.1.1. Con: Whether something is legal or not has nothing to do with the ethics of it.
1.3.2. Pro: Re-purposing dead bodies to serve the interests of the living is accepted in organ donations. If all parties involved are consenting, and have consented before death, then nobody is harmed and some actually benefit.
1.3.3. Con: No one being harmed doesn't mean the act itself is ethically permissible. As ethics is way more complex than a one to one relationship.
1.3.4. Con: Loved ones of the dead individual in question would be victims, emotionally.
1.4. Pro: What is ethically permissible is subjective, and therefore so is permissiveness of cannibalism.
1.4.1. Con: No society can prosper if ethics are subjective. Subjectivism has serious philosophical fallacies.
1.4.1.1. Con: Ethic values change with every generation. It should not be called subjectivism, but evolution of ideas, mindsets or perspectives.
1.4.2. Pro: Ethical choices by nature handle just specific situations. Though normally not accepted in our culture, it can be ethical in an exceptional situation.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Humans are like any other living creature, vessels of proteins and blood, and as such can be consumed the same if necessary.
1.4.3. Pro: Meat equals meat, it is hypocritical to differentiate human or other mammals.
1.5. Con: Cannibalism permits humans to view other humans as prey. It is ethically wrong to view other persons as such.
1.5.1. Pro: Viewing other persons as prey, as mere things to be used for one's own benefit is the core of criminality.
1.5.2. Con: Human beings prey on each other as a matter of course, economically, socially, politically and in war, mortally. Cannibalism might be a more honest and direct expression of human nature under Capitalism.
1.5.3. Pro: Legal or ethical status for cannibalism may allow for easier concealment of a crime, as a victims remains may be swapped or added to otherwise normalized food.
1.5.4. Con: It is unclear why it is more ethically wrong to view humans as prey instead of other organisms. Moral philosophers such as [Peter Singer](http://decodedpast.com/peter-singer-suffering-consequences-speciesism/7609) have argued that any causing of suffering is wrong, regardless of the species of the victim.
1.5.5. Con: This is more like a survival mechanism, something that is beyond ethics since in those situations, the means to use an ethic set of rules/morals cannot be applied
1.6. Pro: It is permissible to cannibalize another human to save one's own life.
1.6.1. Pro: The survivors of [Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguayan_Air_Force_Flight_571) stayed alive for 72 days by eating the dead and preserved bodies of their fellow passengers.
1.6.2. Pro: In extreme situations, survival of the fittest may determine the outcome.
1.6.2.1. Con: Survival of the fittest is the basic state of affairs in nature, and has nothing to do with ethics.
1.6.3. Con: If the to-be-cannabalized person is still alive and not giving consent this isn't permissable.
1.6.3.1. Con: If the to-be-cannibalised person is still alive and not consenting this is murder which is largely already agreed to be unethical and illegal. However the ethicacy of the act itself changes if the person consents or is already dead. In one instance they are arguably make a choice about their body and in the other they could be said to be a resource, just meat.
1.6.3.2. Con: If the death of one person may save multiple others, this might be ethically permissible.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Philosophical discussions like the [Trolley Problem](https://www.kialo.com/the-trolley-problem-whats-the-right-solution-921/921.0=921.1) look at this very question.
1.6.4. Con: Lawyers know very well the dictum "[Hard cases make bad laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_cases_make_bad_law)." You cannot develop an ordinary rule from an exceptional circumstance. That's not how morality and the law work.
1.6.5. Con: Cannibalism outside of immediate survival would likely weaken the privileged status afforded human life.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Any benefit derived from eating human flesh \(outside survival\) is extremely small compared to the value of that human life. Therefore, even if cannibalism only very slightly devalues human life, it is still unethical.
1.7. Con: Some beliefs forbid the eating of human flesh.
1.7.1. Con: Some belief systems, like atheism are not opposed to cannibalism, so it is not unethical in absolute terms.
1.7.2. Con: The fact that one does not share all of the beliefs of one's fellow humans, does not entitle them to ignore those beliefs completely.
1.7.3. Pro: Many believe that man is created in the image of God, and to them, cannibalism is a serious sacrilege.
1.7.3.1. Con: Many also believe that God\(s\) do not exist, and to them any such sacrilege means nothing.
1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.7.5. Pro: Human societies have evolved past spiritual beliefs that suggest the need to eat human remains.
1.7.5.1. Pro: A new [study](https://gizmodo.com/why-ancient-humans-didn-t-eat-each-other-for-the-calori-1794048767) suggests that cannibalism in the Paleolithic era likely didn't occur for nutritional, but rather spiritual purposes.
1.7.5.1.1. Pro: Compared to other prey - for example, the wooly mammoth - humans were not a particularly rich source of nutrients.
1.7.5.1.1.1. Pro: Considering other humans were as intelligent as the hunters, it would make more sense to trap animals who would yield more nutritional value than hunt humans for food.
1.7.5.2. Pro: Cannibalism can be traced through [time](https://family.wikinut.com/Is-Cannibalism-Fundamental-to-the-Development-of-Spirituality/1d7bh4vx/) and various human cultures, so a spiritual element connected with eating our own is likely to have played a role in the developments of our current belief systems.
1.7.5.3. Con: Sacred cannibalism has been reported as late as the early 2000s, which would indicate that humans have [not outgrown](https://www.sapiens.org/body/cannibalism-ritualized-sacred/) the need for this particular ritual.
1.7.5.3.1. Pro: In war-torn areas like Liberia, participants in [ritual](https://www.sapiens.org/body/cannibalism-ritualized-sacred/) cannibalism are often happy to make their motivations clear. They draw spiritual and physical power from the consumption of human flesh.
1.7.6. Pro: In most cultures, cannibalism is considered disrespectful to the deceased.
1.7.6.1. Pro: Some cultures believe the way a person's body is prepared and laid to rest after its death assists the spirit in moving forward to the afterlife.
1.7.6.2. Con: The deceased themselves do not care either way.
1.7.6.2.1. Pro: Only the living make a deal out of supposed "disrespect" of a dead body. Respect only applies to the dealings between living conscious people. It doesn't apply to inanimate objects, including dead bodies.
1.7.6.3. Con: Funerary rites differ with different cultures, and what may show respect in one place could be perceived as an insult in another.
1.8. Pro: There are many examples of cannibalism in human societies throughout history.
1.8.1. Con: Ethical stance can not be derived by mere precedent. In this regard, honor killings, slavery and pedophilia could also be considered highly ethical.
1.8.1.1. Con: Precedent is an argument in legal reasoning. Its meaning is that you need to make a clear, rational and conclusive statement against a norm which was already adopted in the past. In the legal debate on slavery the argument of the supporters was not that slavery existed and therefore it was legal, but that slavery was legal cause they thought that a human being could be the object of a contract. They were legally wrong and at the end lost the argument.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: The question however is not whether the matter is legal but ethical. There are constantly people challenging perfectly legal laws as they feel they are unethical. Capital punishment is a fine example. Precedent is valid in legal trials but doesn't necessarily tell us if a subject is ethical. The problem with the debate at large is that ethics are subjective.
1.8.1.2. Pro: What behavior is considered ethical is not universal, nor is it objective.
1.8.2. Pro: Cannabalism was common practice on the High Seas. The survivors of the shipwrecked [Mignonette](http://www.duhaime.org/LawMag/LawArticle-1320/Cannibalism-on-the-High-Seas-the-Common-Laws-Perfect-Storm.aspx) ate the youngest to survive.
1.8.3. Con: Some reasons for cannibalism are for [nutritional necessity](https://www.medicaldaily.com/cannibalism-high-protein-diet-youve-never-considered-yields-fewer-calories-eating-other-animals) where other foods are scarce. With the plethora of food available today, cannibalism it is not necessary.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Historical documents [show](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/europes-hypocritical-history-of-cannibalism-42642371/) that cooked human flesh was being sold in English markets during a 11th century famine.
1.8.4. Pro: Bread and wine is transformed into the actual flesh and blood of Christ in the Catholic rite of [Transubstantiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transubstantiation), and then ingested by the congregation.
1.8.4.1. Con: It is a symbolic, not a literal, transformation, that means incorporating the essence of Jesus Christ into oneself. It has never been empirically shown to occur. Also, one can argue that Jesus Christ is a divine being or a demigod, not a regular human being, judging from His supernatural deeds recorded in the gospels. Therefore, technically eating the body of Jesus falls outside the realm of cannibalism.
1.8.5. Pro: Some forms of cannibalism are already tolerated in modern society. Mothers of newborn infants sometimes consume their own placenta and afterbirth for the nutritional value it provides, this is often encouraged by medical professionals in hospitals.
1.8.6. Pro: There may be cultures who practice [child cannibalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_cannibalism#Modern_cases) today.
1.8.6.1. Con: This is likely a form of [blood libel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel).
1.8.7. Pro: 100,000 year-old Neanderthal fossils found in France [show](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/europes-hypocritical-history-of-cannibalism-42642371/) that they had been eaten by other Neanderthals.
1.8.7.1. Pro: Further finds show that cannibalism was common until the extinction of Neanderthals.
1.8.8. Pro: Cannibalism by European soldiers took place [during](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/europes-hypocritical-history-of-cannibalism-42642371/) the crusades.
1.8.8.1. Pro: In 1098, Christian soldiers ate the flesh of local Muslims after a siege in Syria.
1.8.9. Pro: By the 16th century, human parts were used in [medicines](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/The-Gruesome-History-of-Eating-Corpses-as-Medicine.html) throughout Europe.
1.8.9.1. Pro: [Mummia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummia), or ground up mummy, was used in a variety of medicines.
1.8.10. Pro: [Endocannibalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannibalism) was a fairly common practice.
1.8.10.1. Con: It could be distressing to the relatives if humans were consumed, as people still have emotional attachments to their loved ones after death, and may feel protective of them.
1.8.11. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.1.
1.9. Con: Cannibalism is one of the strongest taboos in human society.
1.9.1. Pro: Many cultures have mythologies and legends warning of cannibalism.
1.9.1.1. Pro: The [Windigo](http://www.native-languages.org/windigo.htm) is a monster from Native American legends. According to the story, people can turn into a Windigo when they eat other people. It's an example of a culture that does not accept the practice and even explicitly warns against it.
1.9.1.2. Con: Many perform it regularly. This doesn't necessarily address the ethics of it though.
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.
1.9.3. Con: That something is taboo does not make it unethical.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Eating beef in India is taboo, but most would agree that eating beef is not unethical.
1.9.3.2. Pro: Eating raw meat in some cultures, for example, may be considered taboo because of the proposed health hazards, but it isn't unethical to do so. The same may be true for cannibalism.
1.9.3.2.1. Pro: The [Raw Paleo Diet](https://www.thedailymeal.com/healthy-eating/newest-paleo-diet-needs-stop-it-raw-chicken-because-ugh) has been trending among raw food and Paleo enthusiasts, but has been challenging to completely go mainstream due to health concerns like salmonella and food poisoning among other potentially life-threatening illnesses. However, it is not considered unethical.
1.10. Con: Eating human meat is unhealthy.
1.10.1. Con: Whether it is healthy or not doesn't affect the ethics of it. It only affects the health of the individual who eats that meat, but doesn't affect the others in the society.
1.10.1.1. Con: If enough people's health is adversely affected, this might have a negative effect on society at large.
1.10.1.1.1. Pro: Smoking is considered immoral not only because it harms people because of second-hand smoke, but also because health spending is increased and thus everyone has to pay for a minority's vices.
1.10.1.1.2. Pro: Overeating, resulting in obesity, is seen as immoral as society bears the cost of its effects by having to pay for medical treatments of diabetics, for example. In that case a personal choice affects the whole of a community.
1.10.1.2. Pro: If we would have assumed that the healthiness of consuming a certain meat affects the ethics of its consumption; the said logic would deem every other massively consumed unhealthy goods such as all the mainstream "fast-food" and "junk-food" types unethical to consume.
1.10.2. Pro: Eating another human may have devastating psychological effects.
1.10.2.1. Con: Humans participate in other psychologically devastating actions such as wars, which are seen as ethically acceptable. When given the option for informed consent, any lasting psychological effects are seen as accepted risks.
1.10.2.2. Con: If cannibalism was ethically permissible, it would become a social norm and therefore be socially accepted, forging psychological affects.
1.10.3. Con: -> See 1.8.5.
1.10.4. Pro: Cannibalism transmits neurodegenerative disorders such as [Kuru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_\(disease\)).
1.10.4.1. Con: "Meat donors" could be treated similar to organ donors and checked for any health hazards beforehand.
1.10.4.1.1. Pro: Contaminated meat should be thrown away if the contagion cannot be removed through the cooking process; if there are no contaminates then the meat is safe for consumption. Avoid eating raw meat, like always.
1.10.4.2. Pro: Eating human meat comes with an increased risk of [prion disease](https://www.medicaldaily.com/side-effects-eating-human-flesh-cannibalism-increases-risk-prion-disease-and-417622), and potentially death.
1.10.4.2.1. Pro: Prions causing Kuru and similar diseases are notoriously hard to inactivate and can remain infectious even after treating infected tissue with heat and other commonly used methods of [food preparation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740002097901416).
1.10.5. Con: -> See 1.10.4.1.
1.10.6. Con: In the case of cooked human flesh, save for the brain, there are [no inherent health risks](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311277.php); all cases of diseases that can be transmitted are the same as any other food borne illness.
1.10.6.1. Con: Most pathogens are species specific and we cannot contract them from other species, e.g. cows. Consumption of other humans is therefore much more risky as we can become hosts to pathogens present in the consumed individual.
1.10.6.2. Con: -> See 1.10.4.
1.10.6.3. Pro: Biological risks of consuming human flesh can be mitigated by the same processes we use to prepare that of an animal. Most pathogens cannot survive [high temperatures of simple cooking](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/food/guidanceregulation/fsma/ucm517405.pdf).
1.10.7. Con: Eating beef and other meats are unhealthy, too. They are filled with carcinogens and other things that are terrible for the body. But we still eat those things.
1.10.8. Con: Humans eat many things that are considered unhealthy, yet it hasn't stopped us from doing so.
1.10.8.1. Con: Just because something is done doesn't mean it should be.
1.10.8.1.1. Pro: For the good of society many eating habits and unhealthy behaviors should be abandoned.
1.10.8.2. Pro: Eating unhealthy things isn't an ethical issue regarding the "food", i.e. the other human, in the case of cannibalism. It is generally considered a private, free choice, as can be seen by all the other unhealthy things that we are ok with eating.
