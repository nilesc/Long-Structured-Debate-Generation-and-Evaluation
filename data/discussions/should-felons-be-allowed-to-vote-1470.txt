Discussion Title: Should Felons be Allowed to Vote?

1. Convicted felons in the United States \(that is: sentenced of a crime punishable with at least one year in prison or death\) should permanently lose their voting rights.
1.1. Con: Individuals or political parties in power can write unfair laws which deliberately work to disenfranchise any racial or political groups who might oppose them.
1.2. Con: Felon disenfranchisement goes against the American Constitution.
1.2.1. Con: The [14th Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv) of the Constitution explicitly mentions "participation in rebellion, or other crime" as reasons for why the right to vote can be denied. This has been argued by numerous experts in the past \(see [Schall](http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/blj/vol22/schall.pdf), p. 61 and [Brooks](http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2140&context=ulj), p. 111\).
1.2.1.1. Con: While the 14th Amendment does mention "participation in rebellion, or other crime" as justification for revocation of voting rights, the context is clearly related to crimes such as treason or revolt, not, e.g., murder.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: The Amendment explicitly mentions "and other crimes" which makes the context indeterminate.
1.2.2. Con: The disenfranchisement of felons has been ruled to not be objectionable on the basis of the Constitution in a variety of cases; the Supreme Court equally has acknowledged its validity \(see [Brooks, p. 110](http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2140&context=ulj)\).
1.2.3. Con: Constitutions can be amended, so the fact that felon disenfranchisement is currently not constitutional does not provide justification for this remaining the case.
1.2.3.1. Con: Constitutions seldom change. In the 229 years since its enactment, the American Constitution has undergone [only 27 amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution), even though thousands [have been proposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proposed_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Proposed_amendments_not_approved_by_Congress).
1.2.3.1.1. Con: Numerous past amendments to the American Constitution have clarified who is allowed to vote, for example based on race, color and previous servitude \([15th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)\), on sex \([19th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)\) and on age \([26th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)\).
1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: The fact that felon disenfranchisement has prevailed where other forms of discrimination have been outlawed highlights the view that the majority of Americans have of felons and their place in the political process.
1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: As of [2004](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Uggen2/publication/251451257_Public_Attitudes_Toward_Felon_Disenfranchisement_in_the_United_States/links/004635314b17c81fba000000.pdf) \(p. 280\), only the disenfranchisement of inmates was supported by a majority of Americans. That of parolees, probationers and all former felons was opposed by the majority.
1.2.3.1.1.2. Con: However, all these amendments have granted additional voting rights, not taken them away. It seems unlikely that a new amendment would do the opposite.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: Even if changes only happen rarely, they do nonetheless happen. This is sufficient to prove the point that 'constitutions can be amended'. It is not necessary to show that changes occur with any frequency.
1.2.3.1.3. Con: That the Constitution has remained largely static is not a justification for it continuing to do so.
1.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.
1.2.3.3. Con: The fact that disenfranchisement is currently not part of the Constitution does in itself provide guidance for law-making. The intentions behind the Constitution as it stands today are commonly referenced in political and legal disputes in the United States, for good reason.
1.2.3.4. Pro: The constitution not only defines what is seen as right and just, it also enshrines what is right and just. If societal norms change, so should the constitution therefore change.
1.2.4. Pro: The [Eighth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment) of the US Constitution prohibits excessive punishment that is incommensurate with the offense. A lifelong punishment for a one-off felony arguably fits this description.
1.2.4.1. Con: Lifelong punishment for "one-off" felonies is legal and common, such as restrictions on gun ownership or registering as a sex offender.
1.2.4.2. Pro: One wrong act should not permanently prevent people from engaging in the fundamental aspect of our government.
1.2.4.3. Con: For a country that does not find a constitutional fault with the death penalty under "cruel and unusual punishment", it seems implausible that losing the vote would be considered as excessive punishment.
1.2.4.4. Con: The Amendment's [phrasing](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment) prohibits excessiveness only in relation to fines; in relation to punishments it only prohibits them from being "cruel and unusual". Excessive punishments are thus not prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.
1.2.4.4.1. Con: It would not be absurd to claim that disenfranchisement is cruel. Cruelty does not inherently have to include pain or suffering.
1.2.4.4.1.1. Con: The Supreme Court [linked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment#United_States) the application of the "cruel and unusual" clause to violations of human dignity. The withdrawal of voting rights does not fit this definition.
1.2.5. Con: Nowhere in the American Constitution is voting declared a right of every citizen. This is backed by the Supreme Court, which [declared that](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html) an "individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for electors for the President of the United States".
1.2.5.1. Con: This is only because the electors for the President of the United States are officially chosen by the state governments, through whatever process they nominate. Indeed, as this case itself [notes](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html), once a state chooses to elect its electors, all citizens of the state have a right to vote through the chosen process, unless the state decides to no longer choose its electors through an election.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Any other elected office lacks the oddity of the Electoral College, so the logic of the case - that the electors for President are chosen by the state governments, rather than the people - does not apply.
1.2.5.2. Pro: The [only appearances](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/voting-right-or-privilege/262511/#article-comments) that the "right to vote" makes in the Constitution are clarifications of the factors that cannot be used to restrict the right to vote, for example "race, color, or previous condition of servitude" in the [Fifteenth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxv).
1.2.5.2.1. Con: The Fifteenth Amendment, which states that "the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State...", implies that there is a right of citizens in the first place. The fact that it goes on to list particular factors upon which the right to vote may not be restricted does not take away from what it acknowledges in the process.
1.2.5.2.1.1. Con: The amendment specifically refutes the ability to deny votes for race, colour or previous condition but is silent on other things. The fact that there is another amendment \(19th\) to grant women the vote is a recognition that the 15th did not contain a broad right to vote.
1.2.5.2.2. Con: The Constitution is not and does not include a list of rights that every citizen possesses. That it does not give much emphasis to a right to vote thus should not be over-interpreted.
1.2.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.2.1.1.
1.3. Con: Felony disenfranchisement negatively affects electoral processes and therefore undermines democratic legitimacy.
1.3.1. Pro: In [Selectorate theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectorate_theory), the larger the pool of people needed to maintain power is, the more people in power will allocate resources for public benefit instead of private benefits. Removing voting rights from felons decreases the size of winning coalitions which benefits special interest over the general welfare.
1.3.2. Pro: The disenfranchisement has an impact on election results, as on [average three out of four](http://as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/Democratic_Contraction.pdf) felons and ex-felons vote for the Democratic Party. This [distorts](http://felonvoting.procon.org/sourcefiles/uggen_manza_asr_02.pdf) voting outcomes.
1.3.2.1. Pro: This disenfranchisement disproportionately affects minorities and prevents them from taking part in the political progress and representing their interests.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Only 2.5% of the voting age population were made ineligible to vote by felon voting laws in 2010. That [percentage tripled](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/31/felon-voting-rights-impact-on-elections) to 7.7% among African-Americans.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: The disproportionate effect on minorities is not a problem that stems exclusively from felony laws but also from [racial bias](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/24/researchers-have-discovered-a-surprising-racial-bias-in-the-criminal-justice-system/?utm_term=.239860933790) in the justice system.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Whites and Blacks in America have comparable rates of drug use but Blacks are much more likely to be incarcerated for drug crime. In Iowa, for example, Blacks are [8.34 times more likely to be arrested](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/06/04/the-blackwhite-marijuana-arrest-gap-in-nine-charts/) for marijuana possession despite similar levels of marijuana usage to Whites.
1.3.2.1.2.2. Con: Even if minorities commit crimes at a higher rate, to the extent that this results in disproportionate minority disenfranchisement, it still creates an unjust outcome that could be solved by universal felon enfranchisement.
1.3.2.1.2.3. Con: Regardless of whether the cause is judicial racism or legislative racism - or a combination of the two - the effect is the systematic disenfranchisement of minorities. This is a serious enough consequence to justify abandoning felon disenfranchisement laws, regardless of the cause.
1.3.2.1.2.4. Pro: As of 2010, [about one in three](http://paa2011.princeton.edu/papers/111687) African-Americans in the United States is an ex-felon, compared to 8.6%, which is the share of ex-felons in the American population as a whole.
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: The [current disenfranchisement practices](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/opinion/the-racist-origins-of-felon-disenfranchisement.html) in the USA have their origins in the southern lawmakers' efforts to neutralize the black electorate.
1.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: When Virginia introduced felon disenfranchisement provisions in its 1902 Constitution, politicians in favour [explicitly campaigned](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/virginia-felon-disenfranchisement/480072/) on its benefits as a means of disenfranchising black voters.
1.3.2.1.3.2. Pro: When Alabama passed its disenfranchisement provision, its [author](http://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Felony-Disenfranchisement-Primer.pdf) “estimated the crime of wife-beating alone would disqualify sixty percent of the Negroes." The law he drafted took the vote away from those convicted of that crime - but not away from those convicted of murder.
1.3.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: This is one example of a pattern followed in several states - of [tailoring felony disenfranchisement laws](http://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Felony-Disenfranchisement-Primer.pdf) to those crimes believed to be committed more frequently by black people than white people.
1.3.2.1.4. Pro: [38%](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/31/felon-voting-rights-impact-on-elections) of all those who already have been stopped from voting by felon restrictions are black, even though African-Americans make up only [13%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans) of the American population.
1.3.2.1.4.1. Pro: Under [current legislation](http://www.sentencingproject.org/issues/felony-disenfranchisement/) one in 13 African Americans has lost their voting rights, compared to one in 56 non-black voters.
1.3.2.1.5. Pro: When children see their parents aren't voting, they are likely to internalise the notion that voting is unimportant and does not directly affect them. This can lead to wider political non-participation in minority communities for generations to come.
1.3.2.1.6. Pro: In [New York](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/muntaqim.html), prisons are generally located in rural, predominantly white, areas. This enhances the voting strength of white communities, as the state calculates inmates as part of the population base, even though they cannot vote.
1.3.2.1.6.1. Con: Voters in the predominantly white areas of rural [Staten Island](http://www.electionatlas.nyc/maps.html?_escaped_fragment_=StateLegPrimary#!PresprimaryNYCResults) and urban Manhattan do generally vote differently. The move from urban to rural voters does not in itself lead to white over-representation.
1.3.2.1.6.1.1. Con: At best, this demonstrates that white voters do not act as a monolithic bloc. It does nothing to dispel the issue that felon disenfranchisement combined with prison location artificially boosts the voting power of some communities, which are predominantly white.
1.3.2.1.7. Pro: Disenfranchising minorities who commit crimes may lead to the persistence and creation of unjust laws that lead to more criminal convictions for minorities. [Historically](http://felonvoting.procon.org/view.timeline.php?timelineID=000016), there has been an expansion of crimes that lead to felon disenfranchisement.
1.3.2.2. Pro: In Florida, about a tenth of all potential voters are disenfranchised felons. In six other American states, this share is above 7% \([Manza, p. 16](http://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/State-Level-Estimates-of-Felon-Disenfranchisement-in-the-United-States-2010.pdf)\).
1.3.2.3. Con: The vast majority of felons show no interest in voting, even if they are able to, as various studies illustrate \([Uggen et al., p. 786](http://as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/Democratic_Contraction.pdf), [Miles, p. 85](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/381290?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), [Haselswerdt, p. 262](https://www.jstor.org/stable/42940586?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\). The effect of disenfranchisement on voting outcomes is likely to be small.
1.3.2.3.1. Con: This would amount to at least one million people, which is a significant number \(based on [the number of people](http://felonvoting.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000287) currently denied the right to vote\).
1.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: If felons and ex-felons had been allowed to vote, the Democrat candidate Al Gore would have won the state of Florida instead of the Republican candidate George W Bush - and thereby won the Presidential election in 2000 \([Uggen, p. 792](http://felonvoting.procon.org/sourcefiles/uggen_manza_asr_02.pdf)\). This would have allowed a better approximation of the will of the public writ large, and thus a more democratic outcome.
1.3.2.3.2. Con: This study is still a post-fact survey. It's also entirely possible that, denied the opportunity to vote, felons subject to felony disenfranchisement retrospectively convince themselves that they have not been denied anything they value, to make the disenfranchisement easier to cope with.
1.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: There is evidence for this: felons are roughly as likely to have been enrolled to vote or have voted prior to incarceration as the broader population, but less likely to register to vote or vote even after they are reenfranchised in states where felon disenfranchisement is temporary. \([Drucker, p. 6](http://www.plagueofprisons.com/research/sentencingproject.pdf)\)
1.3.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.1.
1.3.3. Pro: Felon disenfranchisement means lower voter participation, less democratic legitimization of political decisions and nominees, and less identification and solidarity with the government among the citizens.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Felons are uniquely affected by government regulation and are therefore especially in need of a voice in that process.
1.3.3.2. Con: Like felons, non-citizen residents are not allowed to vote but are a part of society and are affected by electoral outcomes. This does not mean that political decisions are illegitimate, only that a smaller portion of residents \(i.e. citizens\) have the privilege of participating in the political system.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: However, in most countries, non-citizen residents have pathways to citizenship, if they are willing to take on the obligations of being a citizen. Felons do not have this option when they are denied a right to vote.
1.3.3.2.2. Con: Non-citizen residents are often substantially more free to leave and move elsewhere than felons, as they have citizenship in at least one other country and do not have a conviction limiting their ability to get residency visas.
1.3.3.2.2.1. Pro: This means that they can more meaningfully consent to be governed without representation, as they can usually return to their home countries - where they can participate in political processes - if that matters to them.
1.3.3.3. Pro: As of 2010, about 20 million Americans [were either](http://paa2011.princeton.edu/papers/111687) current felons or ex-felons. As a share of the [235 million](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/00) citizens who were over 18 as of that year, the population of Americans who are eligible to vote would shrink by 8.5% if all felons lost their right to do so permanently.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: What ultimately counts is not the population eligible to vote but the population that actually votes. The vast majority of felons show no interest in voting, even if they are able to, as various studies illustrate \([Uggen et al., p. 786](http://as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/Democratic_Contraction.pdf), [Miles, p. 85](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/381290?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), [Haselswerdt, p. 262](https://www.jstor.org/stable/42940586?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\).
1.3.3.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.
1.3.3.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.2.
1.3.3.3.1.3. Con: In the five months leading up to the 2016 election, Virginia's Governor pardoned some 67,000 ex-felons, in order to restore voting rights. Roughly a third of them [registered to vote](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/virginia-felons-voting-rights/) in time for the 2016 election, even though it required manually checking one's right to vote and pardons were still being issued right up to the deadline. This indicates a high level of interest in voting, given only around a third of Virginia's voting-age population [cast a ballot in 2014](http://vaperforms.virginia.gov/indicators/govtcitizens/voterRegistration.php).
1.3.3.4. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.
1.3.3.5. Pro: Voter turnout in US elections is already [lower than](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/08/02/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/) those of other countries. Disenfranchising felons only exacerbates this problem.
1.3.3.5.1. Pro: This raises questions of democratic legitimacy; for example, Barack Obama won the 2012 presidential election with the votes of only 28% of those who were eligible to vote.
1.3.3.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.
1.3.3.6. Pro: Beyond illegitimacy, the exclusion of convicts makes the electorate less reflective of society overall, which will lead to public policy that does not serve the needs of all citizens equally.
1.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.3.5. Con: Felons have proven to have a lack of maturity and good judgement, which is an impediment to making good choices.
1.3.5.1. Pro: In the same vein, most felons are [not allowed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_Control_Act_of_1968) to buy guns - since 1968 - and are, for this purpose, put on a level with people found mentally incompetent and immature.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: Guns are very likely to be used to harm other citizens and break the law. The same cannot be said about voting.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Individuals who are not able to live a responsible life cannot be made responsible for others, in this case through partaking in choosing the political and legal future of a nation.
1.3.5.2.1. Con: If felons are considered too immature to vote, they should also not be trusted with buying alcohol, driving cars and raising children, yet this is not the case.
1.3.5.2.1.1. Con: There are degrees of immaturity. It is entirely possible for someone to lack the maturity for one task, but not another.
1.3.5.2.1.1.1. Con: Whereas an individual vote is highly unlikely to have any significant effect, a lack of maturity in dealing with alcohol, cars and children can have potentially catastrophic consequences for other peoples' lives.
1.3.5.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: As of 2008, a single vote cast in that year's Presidential election had - depending on the state - [on average](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/probdecisive2.pdf) "a 1 in 60 million chance of being decisive".
1.3.5.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.2.1.1.1.
1.3.5.2.1.3. Con: There is no equivalence between voting rights and these restrictions designed to protect the health and safety of others.
1.3.5.2.2. Con: Good judgment is not a requirement we generally impose upon voting.
1.3.5.2.2.1. Pro: It is difficult to assess what 'good judgment' means, and it therefore should not be applied as a test for voting rights.
1.3.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: Political opponents can redefine 'good judgment' and restrict voting rights of their adversaries.
1.3.5.2.2.2. Con: The mentally ill are affected by laws restricting their voting rights in around [30 states](http://www.866ourvote.org/newsroom/publications/body/0049.pdf).
1.3.5.2.2.2.1. Con: These almost exclusively apply to those declared mentally incompetent and unable to make an informed decision at the ballot box - for example, because of a significantly impaired ability to understand their actions or the world around them.
1.3.5.2.2.3. Pro: Citizens are allowed to vote on any basis they choose. Even if they are completely uninformed and flip a coin to decide how to vote, society still allows them to make that democratic choice.
1.3.5.2.2.4. Pro: Plenty of other citizens exercise obviously bad judgment and regret it - for example by blowing their life savings on the lottery - yet retain their right to vote.
1.3.5.2.2.5. Con: There are voting limitations to prevent people without good judgement from voting.
1.3.5.2.2.5.1. Pro: The assumption underlying a minimum voting age is that citizens beneath it lack the maturity to make good elective decisions.
1.3.5.2.2.5.1.1. Con: The minimum voting age is meant to ensure that voters are capable of making an informed decision. There is no reason why a felon would not be able to do so.
1.3.5.3. Con: Felons' votes are not numerous enough to derail the political process as a whole, given they are substantially outnumbered by other voters.
1.3.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.1.
1.3.5.3.2. Pro: Only about 2.5% \([Uggen et al., p. 1](http://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/State-Level-Estimates-of-Felon-Disenfranchisement-in-the-United-States-2010.pdf)\) of potential voters are currently disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. Taking into account that their turnout if they could vote is estimated to lie between 20% and 39% \([Uggen/Manza, p. 786](http://as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/Democratic_Contraction.pdf)\), it is difficult to imagine that those currently disenfranchised would make a significant difference in the vast majority of elections.
1.3.5.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.1.
1.3.5.3.2.2. Con: In the 2016 election, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin all voted for Donald Trump [by a margin of well under 1%](https://interactives.ap.org/2016/general-election/?SITE=NEWSHOURELN). Even if just these three states had switched, the election would have gone to Hillary Clinton. It is ridiculous to suggest that even [1% of the electorate cannot make a significant difference to the outcome](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-a-difference-2-percentage-points-makes/).
1.3.5.3.2.2.1. Con: Assuming that 40% of all currently disenfranchised felons in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin would have voted if they could, and if all of them would have voted for Hillary Clinton, based on each state's [disenfranchisement rate](http://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/State-Level-Estimates-of-Felon-Disenfranchisement-in-the-United-States-2010.pdf) \(p. 16\), she still would not have won any of those states.
1.3.5.3.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.3.
1.3.5.3.2.4. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.2.
1.3.5.4. Con: Felons understand the prison system and its impact on people better than non-felons. By allowing them to vote, we can encourage better/more realistic laws and policies regarding incarceration.
1.3.5.4.1. Con: Decisions about the prison are generally made after elections as they are not a prominent part of campaigns.
1.3.5.4.1.1. Con: Where an individual's right to vote is restricted, that is a message to society that the opinions of those individuals are not worthy of merit, which can affect policy discussions more broadly. It is very difficult to improve the US prison system when people view the opinions of those with the greatest insight into it to be irrelevant.
1.3.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: Since people generally look down on felons, felons might be the only people with political will to try to improve prisons, such as by trying to implement strong [rehabilitation](http://reverbpress.com/justice/want-prisons-punish-rehabilitate/) programs.
1.3.5.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Even though this might seem intuitive, the public does not necessarily call for stricter sentencing regimes. As of 2014, for example, [two-thirds of Americans](http://www.people-press.org/2014/04/02/americas-new-drug-policy-landscape/) saw the move away from mandatory prison sentences for drug offenses as positive and supported a focus on treatment instead of imprisonment.
1.3.5.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Indeed, [various](http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/tandi_pdf/tandi407.pdf) [studies](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/203006/Analysis_of_complete_You_be_the_Judge_website_experiences__web_.pdf) [have](https://www.liv.asn.au/staying-informed/lij/lij/july-2016/sentencing-study-backs-judges) found that jurors and members of the public would give more lenient sentences than judges, when given the same information judges have in sentencing.
1.3.5.4.1.1.2. Con: There is little reason to assume that felons know how to improve the prison system better than corrections officers, researchers and police officials. By the same logic, patients would be assumed to know how to reform hospitals.
1.3.5.4.1.1.2.1. Con: The point of including prisoners in the process is not to do it to the exclusion of correction officers et al. It is to say that in order to get the best prisons, we should canvas opinions from all who are affected.
1.3.5.4.1.1.2.2. Con: We would expect patients to also weigh in on the best way to reform hospitals \(and they do\) but not at the expense of doctors' opinions.
1.3.5.4.1.1.3. Con: There is little reason to assume that felons would improve the prison system in a way that best serves society's general interests - especially after they have already shown a disregard for society's norms and rules.
1.3.5.4.1.1.3.1. Con: That is not a justification for disregarding their opinion entirely. We frequently consider the views of biased individuals when implementing policy.
1.3.5.4.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: For example, we would expect minorities to give input on policies that directly affect them even though those opinions are likely to be biased in some way.
1.3.5.4.1.1.3.2. Pro: The most probable assumption is that felons would improve the prison system according to their own interests, better conditions in jail, no cellular imprisonment, etc., in order to mitigate the punishment they received.
1.3.5.4.1.1.3.2.1. Con: They can also provide useful information on the sometimes appalling conditions within those prisons. They can provide a unique perspective that others who do not themselves experience it never could.
1.3.5.4.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Not being able to cast a vote does not prevent these people from providing such a perspective to the voting public.
1.3.5.4.1.1.3.2.2. Con: Better prison conditions improve results, as lower recidivism rates in [Nordic countries](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-norways-prison-system-is-so-successful-2014-12) show.
1.3.5.4.1.1.3.2.3. Pro: Recidivism rates are quite high. Felons could vote in preparation for their next stay in prison.
1.3.5.4.1.2. Con: While it is true that single issues do not often decide elections, there are examples where an issue has been a major factor in a particular result \(for example, Gerald Ford's pardoning of Nixon prior [to the 1976 presidential election](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/president-ford-pardons-former-president-nixon)\). It is not inconceivable that in the future there might be an election where felons would have a considerable stake in the outcome without being able to affect it under this policy.
1.3.5.4.1.2.1. Con: While it is possible, it is unlikely that prisons will feature prominently as a topic. Typically the focus of elections is the [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_the_economy,_stupid).
1.3.5.4.1.2.1.1. Con: This may be true of national elections, but more local elections often revolve around law and order issues - particularly in those parts of America that elect judges, attorney generals, sheriffs or police commissioners.
1.3.5.4.1.3. Pro: For politicians, there is little point in appealing to felons, as the vast majority of them show no inclination to participate in elections anyway \([Uggen et al., p. 786](http://as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/Democratic_Contraction.pdf), [Miles, p. 85](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/381290?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), [Haselswerdt, p. 262](https://www.jstor.org/stable/42940586?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\).
1.3.5.4.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.
1.3.5.4.1.3.2. Con: Even if one does not make laws which specifically benefit felons, there is a disincentive to make laws that negatively target them when they can vote, as this may cause them to vote for an opponent. This disincentive does not exist when they are disenfranchised.
1.3.5.4.1.4. Con: A significant reason why prison reform may not feature substantially in current campaigns is that felons and ex-felons are currently prevented from voting. It is plausible that this would change if felons and ex-felons could vote.
1.3.5.4.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.
1.3.5.4.1.4.2. Con: As of now, [only ten](http://felonvoting.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000286) American states with only 17% of the total US population permanently bar felons from voting. Thus, felons writ large have some democratic impact, but not as much as they could have.
1.3.5.4.1.5. Con: While elections are not usually determined by a single issue, politicians seeking election try to appeal to as many voters as possible. This would lead them to make election promises that pertain to specific issues of importance to groups of voters, such as prison reform for felons in the electorate.
1.3.5.4.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.3.
1.3.5.4.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.3.2.
1.3.5.4.1.5.3. Con: The fact that appeals to convicted felons would probably not go down well with other voters, and would most likely result in a net loss of voter support, provides a disincentive for politicians to appeal to felons.
1.3.5.4.1.5.3.1. Con: It is unlikely that other voters would vote against a candidate solely because they had policies that appealed to felons. People tend to vote for policies which affect themselves more strongly.
1.3.5.4.1.5.3.2. Con: It is not at all clear why candidates would need to be unsubtle in appealing to these new voters. Many would vote in the same way and on the same issues as other voters with their socioeconomic background.
1.3.5.4.1.5.3.3. Con: [About 9%](https://www.libertariannews.org/2014/06/05/what-percentage-of-us-adult-population-that-has-a-felony-conviction/) of the adult US population has a felony conviction. That is a significant number of voters which has to be attracted in order to win elections, especially in times in which the two major parties are close concerning votes.
1.3.5.4.1.5.3.3.1. Con: These 9% of the US population are no uniform group that politicians could appeal to. They belong to all socio-economic and demographic categories.
1.3.5.4.1.5.3.3.1.1. Con: [On average, three out of four](http://as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/Democratic_Contraction.pdf) felons and ex-felons vote for the Democratic Party.
1.3.5.4.1.5.3.3.1.2. Con: Politicians appeal to diverse groups frequently. Teachers, for example, are a group of citizens from all walks of life but that does not mean there are no policies that affect them all.
1.3.5.4.1.5.3.3.1.3. Con: An example of a reform that would appeal to ex-felons could be changing the laws surrounding the availability of criminal records.
1.3.5.4.1.6. Pro: Most elections in the United States are not issue-specific.
1.3.5.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.1.2.
1.3.5.4.3. Con: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.1.3.
1.3.5.4.4. Con: Prisons are how we deal with people who have transgressed against society. Thus, the law-abiding members of society, not those who have already transgressed, should determine how to deal with transgressors.
1.3.5.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.1.3.
1.3.5.4.5. Pro: The state is taking on responsibility for prisoners; the prisoners' lives are in the government's control. Letting felons vote allows better democratic oversight over people whose lives are the responsibility of the government.
1.3.5.5. Con: -> See 1.3.5.2.2.
1.3.5.6. Con: -> See 1.3.5.2.1.
1.3.5.7. Pro: Criminality is a reasonably reliable measure of poor judgment. By preventing felons from voting, you create an electorate which has, on average, better judgment. This should translate to wiser voting decisions and, by extension, better law and policy making.
1.3.5.7.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.2.2.
1.3.5.7.2. Con: Similar arguments have been used to deny the vote to women, ethnic minorities, and the poor throughout history.
1.3.5.7.2.1. Con: Using criminal convictions as a measure of judgment to remove voting rights is more ethical than denying franchise to women, the poor, or ethnic minorities as felons lose their vote because of their actions rather than their invariant characteristics.
1.3.5.7.3. Con: The American public is [already highly misinformed](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379413001522). Taking away felons' voting rights would thus have little to no effect on political realities.
1.3.5.8. Con: -> See 1.3.5.7.2.
1.3.5.9. Pro: One of the main goals of punishment is to protect society. Just as we incapacitate dangerous individuals, so too we have to protect society from the poor judgement of criminals.
1.3.5.9.1. Con: The fact that a person supposedly exhibited poor judgment in one particular instance is not evidence that all of their thoughts and opinions are the result of poor judgment.
1.3.5.9.2. Con: Many felons don't have poor judgement, or even malicious judgement.
1.3.5.10. Con: At best, felons have proven that they had poor judgement, on one issue, at one point in their life. That is not the same as proving a general incapacity to make good decisions.
1.3.6. Pro: In communities where there is a high proportion of ex-felons, non-felons are likely to also be socialised into not voting. This [distorts](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00640.x/abstract) electoral outcomes against these communities.
1.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.6.
1.3.8. Pro: By permanently disenfranchising felons, there is a perverse incentive for governments to use the criminal justice system for political gain.
1.3.8.1. Pro: By creating laws with the intention of targeting distinct groups within society, the government can disenfranchise people likely to vote against them.
1.3.8.1.1. Pro: Both sides of the political spectrum have historically shown themselves to be willing to implement laws which benefit their electoral chances \(examples include redistricting and voter ID laws.\)
1.3.8.1.1.1. Pro: The North Carolina Republican party branch actually [celebrated](http://www.vox.com/identities/2016/11/7/13552832/north-carolina-republicans-black-turnout) the disproportionate effects of their voting changes on African-American turnout in the 2016 election.
1.3.8.1.1.2. Pro: For example, by implementing mandatory minimums for drug crimes which disproportionately affect African Americans, Republicans could permanently disenfranchise a group which [statistically](http://www.gallup.com/poll/139880/election-polls-presidential-vote-groups.aspx) votes Democrat \(or vice versa\).
1.3.8.1.2. Con: The US government cannot specifically target racial groups, even indirectly. [Yick Wo v. Hopkins](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/356/case.html) \(1886\) held that laws that are de facto discriminatory \(i.e. race-neutral on face, but administered, enforced, or applied prejudicially\) violate the 4th Amendment. In Yick Wo specifically, San Francisco enacted a law banning laundry facilities in wooden buildings. While race-neutral on face, this law was designed to target Chinese people, who owned most of the wooden laundries in San Francisco.
1.3.8.1.2.1. Con: While this is technically legally the case, that does not appear to have stopped legislatures from continuing to adopt laws with racially-determined effects, such as the US' [crack cocaine laws](https://mic.com/articles/42871/fair-sentencing-act-are-crack-cocaine-laws-intentionally-racist#.yqCmunFsl), which have taken decades to unwind.
1.3.8.1.3. Pro: During America's last two Presidential elections, about [nine out of ten](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/08/politics/first-exit-polls-2016/) African-American voters opted for the Democrats. At the same time, and maybe because of that, African-Americans are the most likely to be affected by felon disenfranchisement laws.
1.3.8.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.4.1.
1.3.8.2. Pro: The presence of a disenfranchisement legislation for felons could encourage politically motivated arresting/conviction/framing of citizens by the party in power to change the electoral distribution in its favor \(i.e by getting citizens likely to vote against the constituent party framed as felons, hence disqualifying them\)
1.3.8.3. Pro: Permanent disenfranchisement as a policy presumes non-partisan creation of what constitutes a felony and infallible application of the \(presumed\) objectively fair law. Given that laws are changeable permanent disenfranchisement become a powerful realpolitik game mechanic rather than a stick to modify behavior.
1.3.9. Pro: You cannot expect someone to play by the rules, whilst simultaneously taking away their ability to change those rules. That is against the ideals America prides itself on.
1.3.10. Pro: If a law is unjust, denying convicts the right to engage democratically to change that law will prolong its existence, and thus prolong injustice.
1.3.10.1. Pro: People unjustly hurt by laws would also lose the right to vote for candidates that could help change unjust laws.
1.3.11. Pro: Assuming criminal behavior is caused partly by social circumstances, disenfranchising criminals would deny criminals the ability to influence policy that might improve those social circumstances and lead to reduced crime.
1.3.12. Pro: Disenfranchisement of convicts is illogical: convicts are not in prison because they do not understand the law but because they choose \(presumably\) to break it. This choice and situation have nothing to do with their ability to understand politics and to choose their political representatives. [Universal Suffrage](https://wordpress.com/post/alchemicalquality.wordpress.com/48)
1.4. Con: A majority of states do not disenfranchise all current or ex-felons \([Leong, p. 2](http://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/child-page/266901/doc/slspublic/NLeong_06.pdf)\) \(though most states impose restrictions on those still in prison or on parole or probation\). A majority of US citizens live in states that do not disenfranchise all current or ex-felons.
1.4.1. Con: If something is happening now, it doesn't mean it should stay the same forever. For example, in some countries \(e.g. North Korea\) citizens' rights are violated all the time, but that doesn't mean they should be.
1.4.2. Con: Only two states - Maine and Vermont - which make up only 0.6% of the American population - actually oppose all forms of disenfranchisement of current or ex-felons. The vast majority of states disenfranchise at least some current or ex-felons and thus do not oppose the practice as such.
1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.1.1.
1.5. Pro: Removal of voting rights for convicted felons assists in reducing the crime rate.
1.5.1. Con: There is no evidence to support this claim.
1.5.2. Pro: The prospect of permanent exclusion from conventional political participation works as a deterrent for potential criminals.
1.5.2.1. Con: This would imply that the felon committed the crime knowing the punishment could take away their voting rights. A majority of crimes are committed in [less educated parts of society](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=814) where they probably don't know that this is a possible ramification.
1.5.2.2. Con: Studies estimate that the vast majority of felons would not vote even if they could \([Uggen et al., p. 786](http://as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/Democratic_Contraction.pdf), [Miles, p. 85](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/381290?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), [Haselswerdt, p. 262](https://www.jstor.org/stable/42940586?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\). Most citizens prone to committing felonies apparently do not care about voting and would thus not be deterred.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.
1.5.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.2.
1.5.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.3.
1.5.2.3. Con: Any potential deterrence needs to be viewed relatively. Disenfranchisement will not work as a deterrent \(or at least will be incredibly marginal\), due to other more important deterrents such as fear of jail or fines.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: People from poorer environments are less likely to vote [already](http://www.people-press.org/2015/01/08/the-politics-of-financial-insecurity-a-democratic-tilt-undercut-by-low-participation/). Given that these people also disproportionately [commit crime](http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2011/oct/19/the-poverty-crime-connection/), this deterrent is unlikely to act on them strongly.
1.5.2.3.1.1. Con: The lower rate of voting among poorer citizens may not have anything to do with how much they value the right to vote.
1.5.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Various state laws, such as voter ID laws, disproportionately [prevent](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/03/how-voter-id-laws-are-being-used-to-disenfranchise-minorities-and-the-poor/254572/) poorer individuals from voting.
1.5.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: Those working shifts, long hours or multiple jobs to make ends meet are less likely to be able to take the time to go and vote, which can take [significant amounts of time](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/02/05/us/politics/how-long-it-took-groups-to-vote.html?_r=0).
1.5.2.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: In addition, polling station access can be used as a political tool by parties, who may [disproportionately close](https://www.thenation.com/article/there-are-868-fewer-places-to-vote-in-2016-because-the-supreme-court-gutted-the-voting-rights-act/) polling stations in minority and impoverished areas when those people are less likely to vote for them.
1.5.2.4. Con: To the extent to which the risk of losing voting rights might operate as a deterrent, it is a poor one, since it can only be applied as a penalty once. Thus, it does not deter against future wrongdoing.
1.5.2.4.1. Con: However it still acts as a deterrent before an individual commits a crime for the first time. So even if it is not as effective for recidivists, it still has its place in the criminal justice system.
1.5.2.4.2. Con: All punishments tend to be [less effective](http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/ccs-ajc/rr02_1/p4_1.html) as a deterrent when an individual has experienced them already. This is because they have survived the punishment and know that they can again.
1.5.2.5. Pro: Unlike many punishments for relatively small felonies, this would affect an individual for their entire life. It therefore would be a useful and additional deterrent as opposed to other punishments which could be viewed as 'slaps on the wrist'.
1.5.2.6. Con: Any kind of punishment-based deterrence is a poor one, since deterrence is [more about](http://nij.gov/five-things/pages/deterrence.aspx) certainty of being caught, not about severity of punishment.
1.5.2.7. Pro: Generally, people desire to have influence over their society. Thus, the ability to exercise that influence can be used as leverage to shape behavior.
1.5.3. Pro: Voting disenfranchisement serves as a constant reminder for ex-felons that they committed a crime and should not do so again.
1.5.3.1. Con: That's a dangerous way of thinking. Imagine if it were everywhere. "Not talking to your spouse serves as a constant reminder for them to never argue with you again". What you get is hope out the window and a problem that grows.
1.5.3.2. Con: It is estimated that voter turnout for felons and ex-felons would range [between 20% and 39%](http://as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/Democratic_Contraction.pdf) \(p. 786\). Thus only a minority will feel disenfranchised.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: From a principled perspective, it should not matter how many people constitute the minority. It is still a wrong for the government to remove any person's vote.
1.5.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.
1.5.3.2.3. Con: Even though many felons might ultimately decide not to vote, they would still sense the absence of having the choice of whether to vote or not.
1.5.3.2.4. Con: The widespread disenfranchisement of felons has created a culture in high-crime communities that alienates voters from civic participation. The results of disenfranchisement should not be used as a justification for disenfranchisement.
1.5.3.2.4.1. Pro: Felons and ex-felons who are not allowed to vote are less likely to teach their children to participate in elections, reducing the democratic power of high-crime communities.
1.5.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: Studies indicate that parents' [voting turnout](http://prq.sagepub.com/content/69/2/373.abstract) and [political activity](http://libproxy.snu.ac.kr/ceb77fd/_Lib_Proxy_Url/www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1554477X.2010.533590) influence children's turnout and political activity. The disenfranchisement of felons would thus socialize their offspring into political inactivity.
1.5.3.2.4.1.2. Con: It is estimated that only about [20% to 39%](http://as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/Democratic_Contraction.pdf) \(p. 786\) of felons who were disenfranchised would have turned out to vote if they could. Disenfranchisement thus is unlikely to change what kind of example they set for their children.
1.5.3.2.4.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.
1.5.3.2.5. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.3.
1.5.3.3. Con: Alongside mental distress, it is very difficult for an individual to rehabilitate when they are told by the state that they have still not discharged their debt to society.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: This permanent exclusion sends the message that no matter how repentant an individual is or how hard they work to make amends for their actions, they will never be equal with other citizens.
1.5.3.4. Pro: During each election \(every two years\), an ex-felon would be reminded of the consequences of their illegal actions as they would be unable to participate as others do.
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: This is meaningfully different from other punishments, which expire after a set period of time. For these, it is easy for the criminal to forget the impact of the punishment after a number of years and thus be more likely to reoffend.
1.5.3.5. Con: The constant reminder can cement the felon's identity as a criminal and outlaw.
1.5.3.5.1. Pro: The exclusion constantly reminds ex-felons that society treats them unfairly, which exacerbates the problems that may have caused them to offend initially.
1.5.3.5.1.1. Pro: A permanent exclusion from the political process creates the impression that the affected individuals' views and interests, thus the persons behind them, do not count anyway.
1.5.3.5.1.2. Pro: [Alienation](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/31/alienation-causes-murder-not-gender) is a major factor which causes people to commit crimes.
1.5.3.6. Con: Constant reminders can cause or add to traumas that result from imprisonment.
1.5.3.6.1. Pro: Constant reminders have the capability to cause ex-felons long-term mental distress, like[jail tattoos](http://www.newswest9.com/story/19138238/program-helps-ex-felons-get-tattoos-removed-so-they-can-find-work) already do.
1.5.3.6.2. Pro: Incarceration [leaves](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17595672) [prisoners](http://harvardcrcl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DeVeaux_257-277.pdf) with long-term scars, e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder.
1.5.3.6.2.1. Pro: While the criminal justice system should seek to appropriately punish these individuals, no government should ever act in a way which needlessly causes mental distress for its citizens.
1.5.3.6.2.1.1. Con: This would also be an argument for ending the system of incarceration as a punishment for crime - indeed, more directly an argument for that \(as a known cause of such distress\) than for ending felon disenfranchisement \(which is an indirect reminder of that trauma at best\).
1.5.4. Con: By this logic, states should have different recidivism rates based on their felony disenfranchisement rules. Yet, one can find states that disenfranchise all current as well as former felons far above and far below the national average, just as one can find states that disenfranchise only prisoners far above or below it \([Leong, p. 2](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/child-page/266901/doc/slspublic/NLeong_06.pdf); [PEW, p. 10f.](http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2011/pewstateofrecidivismpdf.pdf)\).
1.5.4.1. Pro: To emphasize this: based on the available data, the state with the lowest recidivism rate - Oregon - has one of the most lenient disenfranchisement systems, whereas the state with the highest recidivism rate - Minnesota - has one of the strictest ones \([Leong, p. 2](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/child-page/266901/doc/slspublic/NLeong_06.pdf); [PEW, p. 10f.](http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2011/pewstateofrecidivismpdf.pdf)\)
1.5.4.2. Con: However, this is a case of correlation over causation. There are a number of other factors which affect this rate; it is impossible to associate this trend with the felony laws without also considering enforcement policies, demographics and sentencing, among other things.
1.5.5. Con: If felony disenfranchisement lowers crime rates, states should have different incarceration rates based on their [felony disenfranchisement rules](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/child-page/266901/doc/slspublic/NLeong_06.pdf) \(p. 2\). However, the [data](http://www.sentencingproject.org/the-facts/#rankings?dataset-option=SIR) suggests that there is no clear link between the two rates.
1.5.5.1. Pro: This is emphasized by the fact that the state with the lowest incarceration rate - Maine - does not disenfranchise its prisoners, whereas some of the states with the highest imprisonment rates - such as Alabama, Mississippi and Arizona - are among those that disenfranchise all former and current felons \([Leong, p. 2](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/child-page/266901/doc/slspublic/NLeong_06.pdf); [The Sentencing Project](http://www.sentencingproject.org/the-facts/#rankings?dataset-option=SIR)\).
1.5.5.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.2.
1.6. Con: Voting is not a privilege that has to be earned by following the law but an inalienable right of every citizen in a democracy.
1.6.1. Pro: Since convicted felons still continue to pay taxes, disenfranchising them amounts to taxation without representation.
1.6.1.1. Con: A number of citizens of the US already pay taxes without representation, including residents of DC and Puerto Rico. Consequently, the US has clearly shown a willingness to tax people without also wholly enfranchising them.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: That a wrong has been done to one group is not a valid reason to wrong another group as well.
1.6.1.1.2. Pro: There are several groups of citizens that are effectively barred from voting \(either de facto or in some cases de jure\). It, therefore, cannot be an inalienable right.
1.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.2.2.2.
1.6.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.2.2.5.1.
1.6.1.1.2.3. Pro: The US bars citizens of [Puerto Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_voting_rights_in_Puerto_Rico) and [Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_Guam) from voting for Congress and the President.
1.6.1.1.2.3.1. Con: No group other than felons is wholly disenfranchised. At least citizens of Puerto Rico and Guam can vote for their own local governments.
1.6.1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: The extent of the disenfranchisement is largely irrelevant. The fact that it exists on any level shows that there cannot be an inalienable right to vote, but one that comes with certain conditions.
1.6.1.1.2.3.2. Con: The citizens of these territories can hope to vote in the future either by moving to a state which does have voting rights or by recognition of their current territory's statehood. This does not exist for convicted felons, who could never hope to change their situation.
1.6.1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: In the same vein, disenfranchised felons could move to a state where former convicts are not disenfranchised or hope for a change of the legal situation. The situation of the citizens of these territories is thus not markedly different.
1.6.1.1.2.4. Pro: Many [disabled citizens](http://www.accessiblesociety.org/topics/voting/) are de facto barred from voting because polling stations are not accessible.
1.6.1.1.2.4.1. Con: The right to vote does not carry with it an obligation to provide easy access to ID cards or access to polling stations for the disabled.
1.6.1.1.2.4.1.1. Con: However, the fact that governments do not do this shows that they are content with a status quo where certain groups effectively cannot vote.
1.6.1.1.2.4.1.2. Con: For a right to be considered respected, it must be reasonably accessible.
1.6.1.1.2.4.2. Con: The law [seeks to protect](https://www.ada.gov/ada_voting/ada_voting_ta.htm) the right of citizens with disabilities to vote. The failure of polling stations to meet a legislated aim cannot be used to support legislating to duplicate this failure for another group.
1.6.1.1.2.5. Pro: People without [identification cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_ID_laws_in_the_United_States) are unable to vote in many states, which essentially prevents them from accessing their right.
1.6.1.1.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.2.4.1.
1.6.1.1.2.5.2. Con: Citizens can easily apply for an ID card whereas convicted felons lose their voting rights for good, thus the situation is an inaccurate comparison.
1.6.1.1.2.6. Pro: The citizens of [Washington, DC](http://content.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1881791,00.html) lack a voting representative in Congress.
1.6.1.1.2.6.1. Pro: Their [local budgets](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/the-district-gets-ready-to-declare-independence--from-congress/2016/04/14/bc61776c-00d4-11e6-b823-707c79ce3504_story.html) are also subject to approval by Congress.
1.6.1.1.2.6.2. Pro: [Section 602 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act](http://www.abfa.com/ogc/tit6.htm) - which finally gave the District basic self-governance rights in the 1970s - prevents it from exercising several basic functions of local government, including changing height restrictions in building codes and governing its district courts.
1.6.1.1.2.6.3. Con: Efforts are underway to remedy that and make DC [the 51st state of America](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/in-quest-to-be-51st-state-dc-convenes-first-constitutional-convention-of-the-21st-century/2016/06/16/4410f1ea-334f-11e6-8758-d58e76e11b12_story.html).
1.6.1.1.2.6.3.1. Con: This is far from a guaranteed outcome. Indeed, there are indications that Congress intends to [wind back](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/congress-once-ran-the-local-dc-government--gop-signaling-it-may-do-so-again/2017/01/30/814f89a2-e71f-11e6-bf6f-301b6b443624_story.html?utm_term=.ab6a05742678) DC's self-governance.
1.6.1.1.2.6.3.2. Con: Efforts to obtain voting rights for DC residents have been underway [since DC was formed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_statehood_movement#History). There have been more than 150 attempts, all unsuccessful.
1.6.1.1.2.7. Con: However, there is no other group which is permanently and irreversibly excluded from the process. All other groups which are barred \(whether legally or not\) are barred due to a circumstance which is not fixed \(for example: age, mental competence, possession of an ID, state of residence, etc.\).
1.6.1.1.2.7.1. Con: The disenfranchisement of felons is not irreversible. A pardon can lift it, for example in the case of a felon who has distinguished themselves through deeds in public service.
1.6.1.1.2.7.1.1. Con: Pardons must be issued [individually](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/virginia-felons-voting-rights/), by the Governor or President, restricting their utility as a method of restoring voting rights.
1.6.1.1.2.7.1.1.1. Pro: In particular, this means that the individual must be brought to the attention of the Governor or President, who must be both interested in issuing such a pardon - there is no legal process to apply for one or to appeal a decision not to grant one - and inclined to do so in the case at hand.
1.6.1.1.2.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: This is a particularly hard hurdle for those who are already otherwise disenfranchised - by poverty or limited education, both of which correlate strongly with felony convictions - to clear.
1.6.1.1.2.7.1.1.1.1.1. Con: In the five months leading up to the 2016 election, Virginia's Governor pardoned some 67,000 ex-felons, in order to restore voting rights. Despite the fact that these individuals were disenfranchised, they still had enough power to cause the governor to pardon them.
1.6.1.1.2.7.1.1.1.2. Con: If the legal situation underlying the disenfranchisement were to change, it is easily imaginable that all affected felons would be represented through one appeal to the authority in charge, for example by an NGO.
1.6.1.1.2.7.1.1.1.2.1. Con: No such list of those convicted of each individual crime exists in the vast majority of democratic states. As such, this would not be possible.
1.6.1.1.2.7.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: This, as well as the fact that abolished crimes may overlap with still-existing crimes, is why general pardon laws - such as the recently-passed UK law to issue pardons for those convicted under anti-gay laws - require [individual applications](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/31/uk-issues-posthumous-pardons-thousands-gay-men-alan-turing-law).
1.6.1.1.2.7.1.1.2. Con: As [the case](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/virginia-felons-voting-rights/) of disenfranchised convicts in Virginia shows, pardons on a large scale are legally possible with sufficient political determination behind them, unlikely as this case may be.
1.6.1.1.2.8. Con: The failure to protect the rights of a larger number of people does not mean that the right in question does not exist. It may simply be being breached.
1.6.1.2. Con: Some criminals derive financial benefit from their felonies, which is untaxed. Thus 'taxation without representation' is not fully applicable in this case.
1.6.1.2.1. Con: Just because someone is an ex-felon does not mean that they do not pay income tax; a number of these people do in fact have jobs.
1.6.1.2.2. Con: Even were it true that no ex-felon paid income tax, they still encounter non-income taxes on a regular basis. For example, all individuals are affected by some combination of sales taxes, inheritance taxes and property taxes, as well as customs taxes in many cases.
1.6.1.2.2.1. Pro: Importantly, a number of these taxes continue to accrue regardless of whether an individual is in jail or not. While in jail, for instance, an individual would still be affected by property taxes and would have a legitimate stake if the federal government decided to change inheritance laws.
1.6.1.2.3. Con: By the logic of this argument, we should give greater voting power to those who pay more tax \(i.e. the rich\). This would go against the fabric of democracy.
1.6.1.2.3.1. Con: To give more political influence to those who contribute more to the commonwealth is a totally legitimate concept and does not necessarily have to be undemocratic.
1.6.1.2.3.1.1. Con: The Supreme Court has frequently drawn on the principle of 'one person, one vote' to strike down malapportionment laws including in [Reynolds v. Sims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_v._Sims).
1.6.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: In companies, those who own more shares have a more extensive right of codetermination because they invested more and therefore have more to lose. This is generally regarded as just.
1.6.1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: The workings of corporations should not be used to justify governmental action as they operate under a different set of principles.
1.6.1.2.3.1.3. Pro: [John Locke](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-political/), considered to be one of liberalism's founding fathers \(his ideas are a part of the basis of the [US Constitution](http://www.ushistory.org/gov/1d.asp)\), believed that only property owners should have voting rights.
1.6.1.2.3.1.3.1. Con: John Locke was alive during the [17th century](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-political/) when democracies were relatively primitive and certainly would not have considered rights for anyone other than white, male property owners. This is not a reason to return to that vision.
1.6.1.2.3.1.4. Pro: An unequal suffrage, meaning that the votes cast by those eligible to vote are not equal, but are weighed differently according to the person's rank in the census, has potential benefits for society as a whole.
1.6.1.2.3.1.4.1. Pro: The successful and wealthy citizens are usually those who have better access to education and thus are capable of making better decisions for society.
1.6.1.2.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: Citizens in poverty and hardship are more prone to populism and extreme wing political movements.
1.6.1.2.3.1.4.1.2. Con: Naturally the wealthy will use their gain in political influence with their best interests in mind. This hurts ordinary people.
1.6.1.2.3.1.4.1.3. Pro: 56 percent of federal inmates, 67 percent of inmates in state prisons, and 69 percent of inmates in local jails [did not complete high school](http://all4ed.org/press/crime-rates-linked-to-educational-attainment-new-alliance-report-finds/). This clearly shows that a low educational level leads to bad decisions.
1.6.1.2.3.1.4.1.3.1. Con: This data does not prove a causation but merely shows a correlation. Both the low educational attainment and the high imprisonment rates might, after all, be the outcome of third variables, for example low socio-economic standing.
1.6.1.2.3.1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: A low socio-economic status correlates with both "lower academic achievement and slower rates of academic progress" \([APA](https://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/education.aspx)\) and imprisonment \([Dolan/Carr](http://www.ips-dc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IPS-The-Poor-Get-Prison-Final.pdf)\).
1.6.1.2.3.1.4.1.4. Pro: [Low levels of education](http://www.livescience.com/18132-intelligence-social-conservatism-racism.html) are linked with racism and prejudice.
1.6.1.2.3.1.4.2. Con: This practice can easily lead to a [plutocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy).
1.6.1.2.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.2.3.1.4.1.2.
1.6.1.2.3.1.4.2.2. Con: Very successful societies like the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy) were considered to be plutocracies. Thus this is not obligatorily negative, as continuity and stability were guaranteed over a long period of time.
1.6.1.2.3.1.4.2.2.1. Con: The Roman Empire was an autocracy, not a democracy. Hence the precedent set by it hardly applies here.
1.6.1.2.3.1.4.2.2.2. Con: State success or survival does not mean the structures of the state are fair, or good for the majority of citizens when compared to the alternatives.
1.6.1.2.3.1.4.3. Pro: This form of suffrage factors achievement and the burden of high tax and dues. Feeling appreciated, tax fraud might decrease.
1.6.1.2.4. Con: There are already proceeds-of-crime laws designed to take away such financial benefits of felonies.
1.6.1.2.4.1. Con: Some criminals will be unable to repay the money that they have earned from crime, especially if they have been doing it for a long time. In those situations, the law will not have dealt with the fact that they were earning money without taxation.
1.6.1.2.4.1.1. Con: In those cases, taxation systems simply arrange payment plans for the outstanding debt.
1.6.1.3. Pro: Given that the US was founded largely upon this [principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation), it is particularly egregious for the United States to subject their citizens to taxation without representation.
1.6.2. Pro: Felons who have served their sentences have paid their debt to society and are normal citizens. Permanently relieving them of their voting rights violates this principle and de facto turns them into second-class Americans.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Prison is the punishment for committing a crime, not a vehicle for punishment. Adding extra punishments like taking away voting rights is uncalled for.
1.6.2.2. Pro: The restoration of voting rights after release acts as a powerful symbol of ex-convicts' [reintegration into law-abiding society](http://as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/Democratic_Contraction.pdf).
1.6.2.3. Con: By maintaining criminal records of felons beyond their release, the state already recognises that the consequences for a crime extend beyond time in jail.
1.6.2.3.1. Con: The persistence of criminal records is also problematic. Just because it currently happens, does not mean that it is right.
1.6.2.3.1.1. Pro: By keeping criminal records and consequently making it harder for ex-felons to be employed, the state is making it more likely that ex-felons will return to a life of crime as a way of providing for themselves and their families.
1.6.2.3.2. Con: While criminal records are kept by the states, they are not generally accessible to any member of the public without good reason. They can be viewed only when there is a pertinent reason to do so \([as in Massachusetts, for example](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleII/Chapter6/Section172)\). This is part of an acceptance that felons should be able to continue their lives relatively unimpeded after completing their sentence.
1.6.2.3.2.1. Con: The disenfranchisement of felons would equally not be public knowledge.
1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.2.
1.6.4. Pro: The American-made or American-approved constitutions of countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Japan and Germany all explicitly refer to a [right to vote](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/voting-right-or-privilege/262511/) instead of a privilege. This is testament to the American understanding of democracy.
1.6.4.1. Con: While America may have had a hand in these constitutions, this does not mean that they have any judicial relevance within America; the American Constitution is the only important document when considering the legality of these laws.
1.6.4.2. Con: The American understanding of democracy is not visible in these constitutions beyond the concept of popular rule. Germany is a parliamentary democracy, while Japan is a constitutional monarchy. In the face of these peculiarities, the different phrasing of the right to vote does not stand out.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: These are differences in government structure and have no relevance to the decision to refer to voting as a right instead of a privilege.
1.6.5. Con: It has been acknowledged that the right to vote can be abridged when proportional. [The European Court on Human Rights has explicitly recognised this](http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Guide_Art_3_Protocol_1_ENG.pdf).
1.6.5.1. Con: Whilst the European Court of Human Rights did allow for proportionate removal of voting rights, it has also [explicitly stated](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{"dmdocnumber":\["787485"\],"itemid":\["001-70442"\]}) that a blanket removal of voting rights from all prisoners whilst in prison was a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.
1.6.5.2. Con: The law and rulings made in the Council of Europe are of little relevance to the United States, legally as well as normatively.
1.6.5.2.1. Pro: The US has a low receptiveness to any international decisions on human rights \([Cassel, p. 4](http://www3.nd.edu/~ndlaw/news/EU-US-HR.pdf)\).
1.6.6. Con: Even if voting is a right, we regularly abridge the rights of citizens; notably, we abridge the rights of felons by putting them in jail in the first place. This is principally the same.
1.6.6.1. Con: Those who have a serious crime on their records from a decade or more ago are still felons. The right to vote is an essential function of living in society. Allowing felons to vote helps them to reintegrate as productive members of society.
1.6.7. Pro: Scholars [argue that](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/voting-right-or-privilege/262511/) the right to vote for everyone is part of the American Constitution, even if only implicitly, and "the only just basis for self-government" as well as the "standards of human rights" that America promotes.
1.6.8. Con: The [Fifth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment) of the US Constitution allows for the deprivation of regularly-referenced inalienable rights with due process of law.
1.6.8.1. Con: This argument merely states that it's legal for the national government to do so; it does not necessarily seem like a good argument in favor, unless "we can, and therefore we should" is valid... in which case, we should also legalize murder, because we can. The legality of a thing is not itself supportive of whether or not it is right to do so \(implied by "should"\).
1.7. Con: The ultimate goal of most punishments is to better the felon and to reintegrate them into society. Taking away the right to vote achieves the opposite by disenfranchising and alienating them from the rest of American society.
1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.5.3.2.
1.7.2. Pro: Restoring voting rights for convicted felons tends to lead to lower recidivism. [Collateral Consequences](https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/U.S.-Commission-on-Civil-Rights-Collateral-Consequences-Testimony.pdf)
1.7.3. Pro: Genuine attempts to correct one's life through continued good behavior and honest process affords a person the rights, liberties, and pursuits of happiness guaranteed and given to each and every American citizen.
1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.1.
1.7.5. Con: Some punishments are not simply aimed at rehabilitation. For example, by giving out long prison sentences, the judiciary chooses to prioritise the protection of society over the rehabilitative prospects of the felon.
1.7.5.1. Con: Even the longest prison sentences usually take the possibility of rehabilitation at least into consideration. At the extreme, in many countries a life sentence [does not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment#Summary_by_country) equal indefinite imprisonment, but expires after a set number of years \(unless there are reasons for continued imprisonment, for example an immediate threat posed by the convict\).
1.7.5.1.1. Con: However, even in these cases where an individual is released early from a life sentence, the large sentence has initially been imposed for the protection of society. Were the judiciary to place a higher focus on rehabilitation in these crimes, they would give a lesser sentence in the first place.
1.7.5.1.1.1. Pro: When a felon is sentenced to a long jail term, that is a tacit acceptance that their rehabilitation is less important, as jails tend to make [rehabilitation less effective](http://theconversation.com/crime-and-punishment-and-rehabilitation-a-smarter-approach-41960).
1.7.5.1.1.1.1. Con: While these sentences might be antithetical to rehabilitation, this is not necessarily the result of assigning rehabilitation a low priority; it might rather be the result of public pressure to enact significant punishment.
1.7.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.1.1.1.
1.7.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.1.1.1.
1.7.6. Pro: Voting rights keep felons connected to civic life as they have a stronger urge to inform themselves and follow public debates.
1.7.7. Pro: The underlying assumption that no one convicted of a felony ever changes is groundless. Thus, someone who commits a crime should not be beholden to that mistake for the rest of their life.
1.7.7.1. Pro: The judicial system functions on the understanding that once you have served your time, you should be free to continue your life without interference from government and further punishment.
1.7.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.3.
1.8. Pro: A felon has violated the rules and laws of the American society and caused harm to its community; he/she should therefore not be part of the processes through which this society governs itself.
1.8.1. Con: If they did their time, then they did their time. They owned up to their mistakes and they paid the price. If they are now contributing to society again, then they deserve the right to vote with that society. Anything else is in no way a democracy.
1.8.2. Con: Not all convicted felons broke the law. A surprising number are wrongfully convicted, and these people deserve to influence the justice system.
1.8.3. Con: A wide range of crimes are classified as felonies, many of which can hardly be seen as having harmed society at large.
1.8.3.1. Pro: For downloading thousands of scientific articles with the intent to distribute them freely, Aaron Schwartz was [charged with numerous felonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#Arrest_and_prosecution).
1.8.3.2. Pro: If an adult has sex with a consenting person who is under the age of consent, even if we are talking about two teenagers aged 18 and 17, this is usually treated as statutory rape and a felony.
1.8.3.3. Pro: The elderly individual who smokes marijuana in order to ease the pain of arthritis may be committing a felony without doing any harm.
1.8.3.4. Pro: It is unjust to strip someone of their right to vote in perpetuity for committing a non violent felony as a young adult. People grow up, and learn from their mistakes.
1.8.4. Con: Taking away an inalienable right, simply because someone violated the law previously, puts us on a slippery slope.  If we did it on that basis, in theory, it is also possible to deny them the right to free speech and even due process. We shouldn't go there.
1.8.5. Con: Human beings should not be excluded or felt as being excluded from their communities since that will only make them more anti-social, antagonistic, vulnerable and prone to resourcing to criminal activity.
1.8.6. Con: This is a permanent way to solve a \(potentially\) temporary problem. Everyone deserves a chance to change. If meaningful change is demonstrated, the withholding of rights should be reconsidered.
1.8.7. Pro: Not allowing convicted criminals to vote is part of the punishment, not being able to join in with society. They have forfeited the right to vote.
1.8.7.1. Con: If disenfranchisement were part of the punishment then under the US Constitution it could not be applied ex post facto, yet [new disenfranchisement statutes have been applied to individuals who had already been sentenced before they became law.](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2013/aug/15/massachusetts-incarcerated-felon-disenfranchisement-constitutional-voting-rights-act-claim-survives/)
1.8.8. Pro: Convicted felons have broken the '[social contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract)' \(by deliberately disregarding society's rules and authority\) and as a result have reverted to a '[state of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature)' \(wherein there are no binding rights or duties\). It follows that in such a state, the right to vote is also voided alongside the other benefits of society.
1.8.8.1. Con: By the same logic, it would also follow that the state - and, indeed, the general population - would be free to do anything to a felon, as they fall outside the social contract. However, the law also values [proportionality](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/463/277/case.html) in sentencing and therefore this logic cannot stand.
1.8.8.2. Con: A portion of society never entered the social contract in the first place \(i.e. those who we consider unable to conceptualise the notion of a social contract\). However, we still extend human rights to all individuals, which is why 'universal' human rights are considered important.
1.8.8.2.1. Pro: Citizens do not consent to be part of the social contract but are forced into it by birth.
1.8.8.3. Con: The felon does not return into a natural state, as they, by serving a sentence, remain subject to society's laws. It is unjust to [selectively dissolve](http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/blj/vol22/schall.pdf) only one side of the contract and to deny the felon the natural state's liberty that should be the result of the social contract's dissolution.
1.8.8.3.1. Con: As the vast majority of citizens remain in the social contract without the freedoms of the natural state, the association has to protect itself from single individuals who strive for their natural freedom and thus for the destruction of society.
1.8.8.3.1.1. Con: The majority of crimes affect individuals and not society as a whole, thus the existence of society and public order is never seriously threatened.
1.8.8.3.1.1.1. Con: The [very definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-order_crime) of a crime that affects public order includes those that "interfere with \[...\] the ability of people to function efficiently", and thus crimes that target individuals.
1.8.8.3.1.1.2. Con: The nature of a civilised society ruled by laws is such that when one breaks those laws to harm an individual, one is undermining the principles that society is founded on and thus harming the society as a whole.
1.8.8.3.1.1.3. Con: According to the [broken windows theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory), even relatively small crimes like spraying graffiti or vandalism have the potential to cause a self-energizing spiral of crime and as a result, whole neighborhoods deteriorate with negative consequences for all community members.
1.8.8.3.1.1.4. Pro: As of 2013, the [most common crimes](http://felonvoting.procon.org/sourcefiles/USBJS%20-Prisoners%20in%202013.pdf) \(p. 15\) for which Americans were imprisoned were drug-related offenses, robbery, murder, rape/sexual assault, and assault, none of which harm society as a whole or are commonly seen as forms of political engagement.
1.8.8.3.1.1.4.1. Con: When individuals live in areas with high rates of these crimes they feel unsafe and constantly under threat because of it. Given that everyone has the right to feel secure in society, these crimes actually harm all people living in the affected areas and not just the individual.
1.8.8.3.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Property values decrease and insurance rates increase in affected areas. This causes additional financial harm to all community members.
1.8.8.3.1.2. Con: After having served their sentence, they are no longer a part of this natural state and thus by this logic should once again gain the benefits of the social contract.
1.8.8.3.1.3. Pro: According to [Hobbes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes-moral/#LimPolObl), a state loses its right of existence if it is not able to protect its citizens, the members of the social contract.
1.8.8.3.1.4. Con: Nothing prevents someone who has breached the social contract from re-signing to it later in life - indeed, parole can reasonably be viewed as the state determining that someone has accepted the social contract and is thus safe for release into society. Permanent felon disenfranchisement fails to take this into account.
1.8.8.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.3.1.2.
1.8.8.4. Con: -> See 1.8.8.3.1.4.
1.8.8.5. Pro: Without mitigating circumstances a felon should lose their right to vote. They lost the right because they violated the social compact with their fellow citizens. Thus, should not have a vote within a civil society.
1.8.9. Pro: By recklessly prioritizing personal benefit over societal good, felons have shown an inability to engage with the principles of democracy, and thus should not be allowed to be a part of it.
1.8.9.1. Con: Many felons are forced into crime because their country has failed them \(socioeconomically speaking\). To remove their voices from democracy is to remove some of the most poignant voices for change away from socioeconomic establishments that compel criminal activity in the first place.
1.8.9.2. Pro: The basic principle of democracy is equality, which convicted felons violated as they elevated themselves above the law and thus above other members of society and their interests.
1.8.9.2.1. Con: But they paid their time to it. If they didn't, then this argument would imply that they should stay in prison indefinitely. As they will, in lieu of this argument, "never be capable of being a contributive member of society again" which is absolutely false.
1.8.9.2.2. Con: Singling out specific members of society and taking away their right to vote violates this very principle.
1.8.9.2.2.1. Con: By using the same logic, any kind of imprisonment or punishment executed by society is also unjust, as it directly renders the inmate unequal.
1.8.9.2.3. Con: Democracy [only requires](http://ann.sagepub.com/content/603/1/24.abstract) the "equality of democratic agency", which is "different from the forms of equality that flow from the values of distributive justice or fairness". The vast majority of felons did not cause any form of inequality in democratic agency.
1.8.9.2.4. Pro: This hurts society as a whole by causing costs.
1.8.9.2.4.1. Con: Tax evasion is legal and yet causes far greater societal costs. Some drug crimes cost society almost nothing, yet their perpetrators can be locked up for decades, costing society a lot more. The financial cost of criminal justice is clearly not a factor in whether felons should have the right to vote; indeed, it's not clearly a factor in whether they are imprisoned at all.
1.8.9.2.4.2. Pro: In 2007, more than 23 million criminal offenses were committed in the [United States](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2835847/), resulting in approximately $15 billion in economic losses to the victims and $179 billion in government expenditures on police protection, judicial and legal activities, and corrections.
1.8.9.2.4.3. Pro: During the time period 1987-90, crimes committed against persons and households in the United States generated medical and mental health costs of $18 billion and property damage and loss, as well as productivity loss of $87 billion \([Shapiro, p.10](https://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/costcrime.pdf)\).
1.8.9.2.4.4. Pro: Crime in communities depresses house values, resulting in lost property tax revenue \([Shapiro, p.11](https://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/costcrime.pdf)\).
1.8.9.3. Con: Democracy does not require voters to act in the service of the societal good; it merely aggregates the opinions of all its citizens, regardless of whether they emphasize personal benefit or societal good.
1.8.9.3.1. Pro: According to [rational choice theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory) voters make decisions based on their individual interests and focused on maximum individual benefits.
1.8.9.3.2. Con: There is a huge difference between not acting in the service of the societal good and expressing individual interests in breach of the law. While the first only hinders society becoming better for all citizens, the latter causes harm to individuals.
1.8.9.3.2.1. Con: The logical extension of this principle is that people should not be allowed to vote for a party if that party has policies which harm others. But this is the point of democracy, balancing the desires of all individuals.
1.8.9.3.2.2. Pro: Voting according to personal interests, even if this goes against the collective good, does not necessarily result in restrictions on the freedoms of others.
1.8.9.3.2.2.1. Con: While it does not necessarily do those things, in practice, it often does. For example, someone who votes for a party that will adopt aggressively racist policies votes for a party that will aggressively restrict the rights of others.
1.8.10. Con: The decisions made through voting processes affect all American citizens, including felons. They have a right to participate in decisions that affect them.
1.8.10.1. Pro: If felons are excluded from voting processes then it is more likely that punitive laws will be put in place that prevent ex-felons from reintegrating with society, pushing felons to return to a life of crime.
1.8.10.1.1. Con: There is no evidence this has ever happened.
1.8.11. Con: Disobeying laws can be an act of political engagement, and can protect society from unjust laws. Some of these felons have not shown an inability, but an active desire not to follow the law. They should assist in refining the law to make it more just.
1.8.11.1. Con: Committing a felony is hardly an expression of political engagement as it represents a serious crime.
1.8.11.1.1. Con: The cut-off point for a crime to be a felony is that it carries a potential penalty of [more than one year](http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-law-basics/what-distinguishes-a-misdemeanor-from-a-felony.html). Many crimes that can be political protest - such as vandalism, in many states - can be felonies.
1.8.11.1.2. Pro: Democracies like the United States offer plenty of means for political engagement that are not based on felonies.
1.8.11.2. Pro: Those breaking the law may, in certain cases, be prioritising other interests and values that the law does a poor job of considering. These actions, in turn, are important in order to create balanced new laws.
1.8.11.2.1. Pro: Certain [animal-rights activists](http://www.nature.com/news/animal-rights-activists-wreak-havoc-in-milan-laboratory-1.12847) broke the law by breaking into a laboratory and releasing the animals. They ranked the animals' well-being as having a higher value than the proprietorship. This value-based decision could equally be discussed in parliament and result in a new law.
1.8.11.2.2. Pro: Breaking the law does not necessarily go against what the public considers just. When a German TV audience was [invited to vote](http://www.dw.com/en/terror-movie-hero-or-murderer/a-36079572) after watching a recent movie in which the protagonist broke the law in order to save thousands of people, 87% of those participating regarded him as innocent.
1.8.11.3. Pro: Journalists and bloggers can be prosecuted for publishing classified content or refusing to reveal [their sources](http://people.howstuffworks.com/freedom-of-the-press.htm) \([Silver, p. 458](https://www.law.upenn.edu/institutes/cerl/conferences/ethicsofsecrecy/papers/reading/Silver.pdf)\).
1.8.11.4. Pro: Whistleblowers intentionally break the law in order to achieve transparency and improve society.
1.8.11.4.1. Con: Whistleblowers are usually not breaking the law, and indeed most countries have statutes protecting them from the consequences of any contractual breaches involved.
1.8.11.5. Pro: Civil disobedience, intentionally breaking a law believed to be unjust, is a valuable and important method of protest.
1.8.11.5.1. Pro: People like Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King, and Nelson Mandela openly broke laws, defied governmental authority, and were imprisoned. Their crimes were in service to society, not against it.
1.8.11.6. Con: Most felonies are not motivated by the desire to engage politically.
1.8.11.6.1. Con: This argument looks at the past only, and ignores the need to ensure that the Constitution protects rights in the future. If there were an increased need for civil disobedience in the future, this balance may change as more people might be convicted of politically motivated felonies.
1.8.11.6.1.1. Con: Laws should not be made based on hypothetical visions of the future.
1.8.11.6.1.1.1. Con: This is not a question of a hypothetical vision; it is logical to assume that if these rights are removed, then future governments will use this to their advantage where possible.
1.8.11.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.3.1.1.4.
1.8.11.6.3. Con: This is not a reason to dismiss the concern that some may well be acts of political engagement, and that it is therefore concerning to disenfranchise those engaged in them.
1.8.11.7. Pro: At worst, even if this is only true for a certain portion of criminals, this argument shows that there should be flexibility in dealing with these criminals. Not all felons should automatically lose their voting rights.
1.8.11.7.1. Pro: Courts already decide between [many motives](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/motive) such as jealousy, greed, revenge, or part of a theft. Adding "political motivation" is not a big deal and relatively easy for the judges to certify.
1.8.11.7.1.1. Con: This would only work to avoid felony disenfranchisement if courts were able to simply decline to convict such individuals. This is usually not an available option.
1.8.11.8. Con: Prosecutors have the option to file charges as misdemeanors, rather than felonies, in many cases. This can be used to deal with cases of political activism.
1.8.11.8.1. Con: Cases in which a legal or political system shows leniency towards those who oppose precisely this legal or political system are hard to imagine.
1.8.11.8.1.1. Con: [Jury nullification](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/nullification.html) is hard to measure, but likely does occur.
1.8.11.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.11.7.1.
1.8.11.8.3. Con: This would be dependent on prosecutors choosing to do this, which cannot be guaranteed.
1.8.11.9. Con: As of 2013, the most common crimes for which Americans were imprisoned were drug-related offenses, robbery, murder, rape/sexual assault, and assault, none of which are commonly seen as forms of civil disobedience \([Carson, p.15](http://felonvoting.procon.org/sourcefiles/USBJS%20-Prisoners%20in%202013.pdf)\).
1.8.11.9.1. Con: -> See 1.8.11.6.3.
1.9. Con: Democracy relies on a principle of equality of all individuals. Felon disenfranchisement violates this.
1.9.1. Pro: Every act or process that is based on exclusion hurts democratic values and erodes democracy.
1.9.1.1. Con: The exclusion of some people from the voting process is well-established in democracies and generally not seen as a subversion of democracy's principles, for example in the case of children.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: [It is debatable that children should have the right to vote.​](https://www.kialo.com/should-children-be-allowed-to-vote-8516/8516.0=8516.1/=8516.1)
1.9.1.1.1.1. Con: The [prefrontal cortex](http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/02/18/at-what-age-is-the-brain-fully-developed/) is not fully developed in children; this part of the brain is very important for crucial tasks with regards to voting like complex planning, decision making and logical thinking.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Despite their evident value to the process in theory, in practice, in part due to how voting is currently set up in America, little complex planning, decision making, or logical thinking go into people's decision when voting. If nobody else uses them, it should not matter if children can't. It's not uncommon for one's vote to be determined by a single issue, like abortion, or racism, and since it's set up to be one of two choices, it usually ends up being pretty black and white.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Voters are chronically misinformed.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Citizens of Western countries routinely [over-estimate](https://www.theguardian.com/society/datablog/2016/dec/13/europeans-massively-overestimate-muslim-population-poll-shows) the share of Muslims among the population, for example by a factor of 17 in the US.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Citizens of many countries over-estimate the share of GDP spent on health services by a factor of two to five \([Ipsos MORI, s. 20](http://perils.ipsos.com/slides/)\).
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Most people [vastly overestimate](https://borgenproject.org/us-foreign-aid-spending/) the percentage of a country's budget devoted to foreign aid.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: It is only rational for voters to remain ignorant and uninformed; this is not the result of stupidity. As individual votes have no chance of swaying decisions and as the costs of becoming informed can be enormous, there is little incentive to do so \([Rauch/Wittes, p. 5](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/more-professionalism-less-populism.pdf)\).
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Voters behave irrationally.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Voters are susceptible to influences in their decision making that make it difficult to perceive them as rational.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Voters in American Presidential elections evaluate politicians based on events beyond their control. For example, voters punish the incumbent party for the economic losses incurred by tornadoes regardless of the actual policy response. This has been [interpreted as irrational](http://myweb.lmu.edu/ahealy/healy_malhotra_random_0310.pdf).
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: The American presidential election in 2000 between George Bush and Al Gore was close until the last days when the sheer volume of Bush's advertising campaign led to an advantage for him. That voters are susceptible to this hardly qualifies as rational \([Jonston et al., p. 184-6](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=HNqu79LXIqkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+2000+Presidential+Election+and+the+Foundations+of+Party+Politics&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjG7JHayPrTAhVOv5QKHRRxAk4Q6AEIITAA#v=onepage&q=The%20typical%20forecast%20placed%20Gore%20some%20eight%20points%20ahead%20of&f=false)\).
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: A famous example illustrating this point is the way in which American voters punished the incumbent President Wilson in 1916 for a series of random effects beyond politicians control that were seen as negative for voters' subjective well-being: shark attacks \([Achen/Bartels, p. 24f.](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/research/CSDI_WP_05-2013.pdf)\).
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The paper that made this argument has been [called into question](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/28/do-shark-attacks-swing-elections/?utm_term=.b1363aefa320) due to methodological flaws. Adjusting the analysis accordingly reveals that the effect of irrelevant events on voting behavior were overblown.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.4. Pro: Research [indicates that](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/29/12804.full) even the results of college football games can influence voting behavior, with wins leading to increased support for incumbents.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.4.1. Con: The study behind this argument has been [called into question](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/45/13800.full.pdf) as it might represent a false positive based on bad luck in the data selection. Other evidence points to no causal relation between football results and voting decisions.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: These results received cautious confirmation from [another study](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jnd260/pub/Irrelevant%20JOP.pdf) that linked the positive mood resulting from football wins to a rise in presidential approval ratings. As the authors caution, this result is based on a small sample and shows only short-lived changes in approval.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.4.3. Pro: Similar results were found by [a study](https://b2998732-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/mkmtwo/Miller-Sports.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cqu1Y-PknbqcHAc3_VFKWcg49bDAj6_RtC0NAukOducN07TE9rJHLUzn9u3eWejtyHf2JriCLK8-Zwu8sjARKXTiG6l7kW5eKcC4VjltZYCLFs6lj1zWJ0aWY9_2NX6_Uakn0pfH4kllPKGQlqUzOvWZtBiP6t6O1_oskPFW24mCy8Za5n4NBZ1mi-vYaqzXod4up4GX8XxyAvBdHNICvGYm4Ns9w%3D%3D&attredirects=0) on the effects of sports results of professional teams on mayoral elections in several dozen American cities over a period of six decades.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.5. Pro: Instead of selecting candidates based on the policies they advocate, voters select them for other reasons, among them party affiliation or even appearance. Once a favorite candidate has been chosen, "voters often adopt that candidate's policy views" \([Lenz, p. 18](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=5AJEAqd4XAAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Follow+the+Leader?&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiu8o7uzPrTAhWKnZQKHSF2AL0Q6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=%22for%20other%20reasons%2C%20such%20as%20performance%20advantages%2C%20party%2C%20or%20superficial%20traits%20such%20as%20appearance%22&f=false)\).
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1. Pro: The infamous presidential television debate between Kennedy and Nixon in 1960 [illustrates](http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/kennedy-nixon-debates) how the performance and even the appearance of a candidate can shift the public opinion about an otherwise even-handed debate. Referendums do not suffer from this effect.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1. Con: As the options in many referendums are linked with certain personalities, voters can still orient themselves with politicians they like or dislike. For example, voters followed Boris Johnson's in the Brexit campaign or Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the Turkish referendum on constitutional reform.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.2. Pro: Arguably, Al Gore lost the 2000 election because he came off as  [arrogant and condescending](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/25/us/politics/george-w-bush-al-gore-2000-presidential-debate.html) in his first televised debate against Bush, despite possessing far superior policy knowledge.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.6. Pro: Voters decide by the looks of politicians. Studies show that baby-faced politicians are perceived as [less competent](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103109001383) and that [good looks](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727270900142X) can translate into electoral success.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.6.1. Pro: The results of elections can even be predicted [by asking children](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5918/1183.full) to choose candidates based on photos. They may not have political knowledge but apparently pick candidates in the same way as do voters.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.6.2. Con: This can also be explained with the apathy that voters feel under the current circumstances. It causes them not to pursue information - and when they are confronted with an electoral choice, they decide based on superficial factors.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.7. Pro: Psychology interferes with rational decision making. Exposure to disgusting or disturbing information, for example, led the participants of a study to express stronger convictions and harsher moral judgments \([Ben-Nun Bloom, p. 510](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12053/abstract)\).
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.7.1. Pro: These effects can even be replicated for incidental, non-conscious influences. In [a study](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611414726), brief exposure to images of an American flag led to a shift in voting preferences towards Republican positions for participants regardless of their prior attitudes and believe that this would not happen.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: As voting is considered to be an [irrational act](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/07/voting-irrational-emotions-politics-ideology) in general \(since the probability of affecting the outcome is virtually nonexistent\), citizens behave irrationally every time they go to the polls, no matter how rationally they decide. Thus irrational behavior cannot be an argument against democratic decision making.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Voting is [not irrational](http://www.philosophyetc.net/2016/07/the-instrumental-value-of-one-vote.html). If we assume that one party is substantially better than the other, the expected value of voting is [positive](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/probdecisive2.pdf), because the costs of having a bad party are very high. Therefore, irrationality is not inherent to the act of voting, and rationality is a valid measure for assessing voter behaviour.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: Voting may be irrational if seen strictly from the perspective of the individual. But it becomes rational to vote once it is taken into account that democratic systems would collapse if each and every voter would act - according to this logic - rational and not vote.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: According to the theory of [Rational Irrationality](http://www.owl232.net/irrationality.htm#4), voters adopt irrational beliefs as the costs of becoming informed \(time, mental effort\) exceed the benefits.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.4. Con: The [lack of a single agreed-upon definition](http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396577/obo-9780195396577-0175.xml) of rationality shows how controversial the definition of rationality is. This implies that it is impossible to objectively determine whether a single act is irrational.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.4.1. Con: Even though we lack a single agreed-upon definition, there is a general understanding of what constitutes rational behavior. And while one can disagree about the rationality of specific actions, there is little dispute about the observation that voters do not live up to the standard of fully rational behavior.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.5. Pro: Voters do not act in accordance with their own opinions and stated preferences. This clearly is a case of irrational behavior.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.5.1. Pro: The American Congress usually has a public approval rating of below 20%; a third of voters believe that their representative is corrupt, half that they are out of touch and serve special interests \([Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx)\). Yet only about 5% of the members of Congress who run for re-election in any given year are voted out of office \([CRS, p. 6](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41545.pdf)\).
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.5.1.1. Con: This behaviour is rational if voters equally believed that their representative's opponents are equally corrupt, out of touch, or subservient to special interests.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.5.2. Pro: Right before the presidential elections that kept Clinton, Bush and Obama in office for another four years, a [majority of voters](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1669/general-mood-country.aspx) were dissatisfied with the general direction the country was heading into - yet they chose to reelect the incumbent.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.5.2.1. Con: It is questionable whether this data can tell us much. The last time a majority of Americans was actually satisfied with the direction of the country [was in 2003](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1669/general-mood-country.aspx). Voter satisfaction thus seems generally low.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2.5.2.2. Con: This preference set is not irrational. It's perfectly reasonable to think that the country is heading in a bad direction, but that the incumbent is nevertheless the better of two bad options.
1.9.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Those with underdeveloped prefrontal cortexes are not prevented from voting.
1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Adults who suffer from prefrontal cortex defects are predisposed to [violence and crime](http://www.neulaw.org/blog/1034-class-blog/3937-prefrontal-cortex-defects-and-execution). Thus, with regards to the debate's assumption, these individuals should loose their voting rights rather than minors should receive them.
1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: A predisposition is not a destiny, regardless of predisposition, it is still ultimately the individuals choice, at least if they are being tried normally, and those who don't have this predisposition can still commit crimes.
1.9.1.1.1.1.3. Con: The prefrontal cortex is not fully developed until age 25. We only prevent voting up to age 18. if the prefrontal cortex was the reason for denying children the right to vote, there would not be this 7 year discrepancy.
1.9.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The [cortex's development](http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/02/18/at-what-age-is-the-brain-fully-developed/) goes gradually: you can expect an 18-year-old to be far more advanced than a 10-year-old.
1.9.1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: We can expect a 25 year old to be far more advanced then an 18 year old, if it's worth waiting for one, it's worth waiting for the other.
1.9.1.1.1.1.4. Con: Being able to only make poor choices with regards to your future is still considerably better then not being able to make any choice with regards to your future.
1.9.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: Politicians can more easily manipulate or 'bribe' children and teens than adults.
1.9.1.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: [Teens](https://harvardmagazine.com/2008/09/the-teen-brain.html) are more easily influenced by others and more prone to impulsive behavior than adults.
1.9.1.1.1.1.5.2. Con: Politician's job is to 'bribe' there constituents, having policies that the people want is how people get elected.
1.9.1.1.2. Con: Simply because that is how it's always been done, is not a good reason to keep doing it. Lack of democracy at all used to not be seen as a subversion of a people's principles, until it was.

Tradition should not prevent us from moving forward.
1.9.1.2. Pro: Liberal democracy is a [philosophy of inclusion](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/16921). To disenfranchise a part of society sabotages that fundamental value of democracy.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: Democracies not only strive for maximum inclusion, they also require something like a [common identity](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/16921). If the inclusion of felons undermines this common identity, their exclusion can be justified.
1.9.1.2.2. Pro: [Young \(p. 11\)](https://books.google.de/books?id=Gonp8GXTxb0C&pg=PA11&hl=de&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f=false) argues that a strong and normatively legitimate democracy has to include all equally in the process that leads to decisions that affect all members of society.
1.9.1.3. Con: Exclusion can be regarded as a measure to maintain a democratic society by excluding those who want to abolish it or who threaten society's values from the decision-making process.
1.9.1.3.1. Con: People who commit crimes may have caused harm only to themselves, or a single other, and thus do not pose a threat to society at large.
1.9.1.3.1.1. Con: Laws are how society shapes the behavior that it considers so harmful as to be prohibited. Therefore, violating the law means committing acts society especially condemns.
1.9.1.3.1.2. Con: Breaking the law shows disrespect to all of society, as opposed to an individual.
1.9.1.3.2. Con: The vast majority of felons can hardly be said to want to abolish democracy, and their disagreements with society's values are often limited to specific laws.
1.9.1.3.2.1. Con: The issue is less whether felons disagree with the values of society and more their disregard for the values of society.
1.9.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Just because a felon commits a crime does not necessarily mean they disregard all the values of society nor the concept of the society.
1.9.1.3.3. Pro: A look at history clearly shows that democratic processes were used to abolish democracy by individuals and organizations that turned out to be criminals, e.g. the [National Socialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party#Rise_to_power:_1925.E2.80.931933).
1.9.1.3.3.1. Con: However this can easily work both ways; some democracies have been vastly strengthened by the actions of 'criminals', [such as the ANC in South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_African_National_Congress#Opposition_to_Apartheid).
1.9.1.3.3.2. Con: The type of criminality involved in this example is very specific, and directed towards abuse of the democratic process to acquire power. A petty thief, for example, hardly shares much in common with Hitler.
1.9.1.3.3.3. Con: The first steps taken by the Nazi Party to consolidate power involved the prohibition of opposition parties and silencing of critical voices. This is less an example of where exclusion of some could have preserved democracy, and more an example of how exclusion of some was used to end democracy.
1.9.1.4. Pro: The practice of felony disenfranchisement creates a social class without a political voice and representation.
1.9.1.4.1. Pro: Felons are just as much part of the population as any other citizen, and should be represented in a democracy.
1.9.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.
1.9.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.
1.9.1.4.4. Pro: Permanently disenfranchised members of society are under the control of others, as they are excluded from the decision-making process. As a result they lose their status as citizens and become subjects.
1.9.1.4.4.1. Con: Even without voting rights, felons are still under the protection of [civil rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights) and not subject to governmental arbitrariness.
1.9.1.4.4.1.1. Con: The inability to vote makes it very difficult for them to discourage politicians from further curtailing their civil rights.
1.9.1.4.4.2. Pro: Those affected by the voting disenfranchisement become a minority without a political voice, easy victims of the [tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority).
1.9.1.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.
1.9.1.4.6. Pro: Felons are directly affected by laws concerning crime, so they should have a say in them.
1.9.1.5. Pro: The disenfranchised citizens have to deal with a limitation of their [liberty](http://www.ushistory.org/gov/1d.asp) in the form of restrictions of their self-determination. This violates one of the basic values of a liberal democracy.
1.9.1.5.1. Con: We accept countless other restrictions of individual freedoms, most of which affect an individual's life far more than disenfranchisement. Thus, there is apparently nothing wrong with limiting individuals' self-determination.
1.9.1.6. Pro: The more restrictions on voting that exist, the easier it is to justify more, as the government can simply point to other groups which have lost their right to vote as a basis to take it from others. This restriction therefore undermines the future stability of the democracy.
1.9.1.6.1. Con: This kind of slippery slope analysis does not work for voting rights, as there are no other groups in society that have perpetrated wrongs against the state in the same way as felons.
1.9.1.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.7.
1.9.1.6.1.2. Con: Politicians inclined to do so can argue that the justification for felony disenfranchisement is broader - for example, that it is about protecting the process from those with poor judgement, or that it is about protecting society's values. Once they have done that, it is much easier to argue that these justifications apply to other groups in society.
1.9.1.6.2. Pro: Precedent has an important effect not only in the judicial setting but also in the way it influences the decisions that governments make.
1.9.1.6.2.1. Pro: Airport security checks, for example, have become consecutively [more invasive](https://www.wired.com/2013/06/fa_planehijackings/) over the past few decades. In 1970, most airlines even [opposed](https://www.wired.com/2013/06/fa_planehijackings/) the idea of individual passenger screening, which is perfectly normal today.
1.9.1.6.3. Pro: While this may not be likely to occur in the US as it looks at the moment, it could become hugely problematic were a government to be elected that was slightly more autocratic.
1.9.1.7. Con: Most democratic societies have some sort of exclusion, e.g. in regard to minimum ages of presidents or judges. This exclusion is no erosion of democratic values.
1.9.1.7.1. Con: Perhaps this exclusion is also unjust; presuming that presidents or judges need to be a certain age to be competent is somewhat ageist and undemocratic when approximately half of the US does not meet the threshold.
1.9.1.7.2. Con: The rules referred to here do not exclude anyone from participating in democratic processes in principle, only from assuming certain offices under specific circumstances.
1.9.1.7.2.1. Pro: Minimum age requirements are, by definition, not a mechanism of permanent exclusion \(as would be the case with permanent disenfranchisement\).
1.9.1.7.2.2. Pro: Being excluded from an extremely powerful and rare public position is somewhat less harmful than the widespread exclusion of felons from the basic mechanism of democracy.
1.9.1.7.2.3. Pro: Elected representative roles are not the expression of democratic will, voting is. Those excluded from holding representative positions under such provisions still have the complete right to vote for representatives to express their will.
1.9.1.7.2.4. Con: Part of the democratic process is being freely able to run for office, otherwise you are just lurching towards oligarchy.
1.9.1.8. Pro: Just because someone does not agree with society's values does not mean he/she should be excluded from the democratic process. After all, that would be undemocratic in its own right.
1.9.1.8.1. Pro: The entire premise of democracy is the compilation of all of society's values. Those who disagree with those currently codified should still have a say.
1.9.2. Pro: As the definition of a felony is open to interpretation, permanent felony disenfranchisement is in effect an arbitrary punishment.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Many crimes face constantly changing societal views \(and in some cases are no longer even considered crimes, for example sodomy and adultery\), so it does not make sense to permanently disenfranchise someone. The legal system is fluid, and permanent punishments are incongruous with that.
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: The law is not necessarily good or just, and violating it is necessarily bad. It may be a form of activism, ex civil disobedience, or the law may simply be wrong. It used to be illegal for black people to sit at the front of the bus, should they have lost their right to vote? Protesting is increasingly becoming a crime, should protesters lose theirs? Marijuana users?
1.9.2.1.2. Con: If the act that a disenfranchised felon was convicted of is later de-criminalized, the felon's voting rights could be reinstated through an amnesty or act of law.
1.9.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.2.7.1.1.
1.9.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.8.11.6.1.1.
1.9.2.1.4. Pro: It is unfair to keep punishing those who in the past violated a law that is now legal.
1.9.2.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.2.7.1.
1.9.2.1.4.2. Pro: Those who serve a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence in Colorado for [marijuana](http://www.alternet.org/drugs/i-am-serving-10-year-mandatory-minimum-marijuana-colorado) possession should be allowed to vote, since marijuana is now legal.
1.9.2.2. Con: By this logic, all constitutions and legal frameworks are void as they all include arbitrary provisions by the standards of this claim \(e.g. the definition of a minimum voting age\).
1.9.2.2.1. Con: While all legal frameworks are to some extent arbitrary, an individual who is prejudiced by them always has the option to show their displeasure through voting and political engagement. This would not be true if we took away convicted felons' right to vote.
1.9.2.2.1.1. Con: Felony disenfranchisement is the result of laws and just as amendable by democratic processes as are constitutions and other legal frameworks.
1.9.2.2.1.1.1. Con: This is no comfort to the ex-felons who are denied the opportunity to influence those processes.
1.9.2.2.1.2. Con: Felons are not the only group affected by this. People beneath the voting age equally cannot appeal against the law that prohibits them from voting as they cannot vote.
1.9.2.2.1.2.1. Con: However, the harm suffered by ex-felons is directly related to their inability to oppose arbitrary legal frameworks. Other persons who are disenfranchised \(such as the mentally disabled and children\) are also treated as exceptions by the law.
1.9.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: When a child commits a crime, they are tried in a different court and normally receive more lenient sentences \(if any at all\).
1.9.2.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Someone who is mentally disabled and commits a crime can plead mental incompetency and is treated in a different way by the law.
1.9.2.2.1.3. Con: Felons have plenty of other opportunities to make their voices heard, for example through civil society organizations and advocacy campaigns.
1.9.2.2.1.3.1. Con: These organisation and campaigns are viewed as less important when the government says that the people within them are unworthy of a political voice.
1.9.2.2.1.3.2. Con: These methods of democratic participation require significantly more time than voting does, making them less accessible - and often less effective.
1.9.2.3. Pro: Beyond the definition of what crimes constitute a felony, the degree of punishment and whether the crime thereby qualifies as a felony is anything but predictable.
1.9.2.3.1. Pro: Whether the possession of illegal drugs is charged as a misdemeanor or a felony ultimately [depends on](http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/felony-drug-possession.htm#) the prosecutor’s choice and interpretation of various potentially aggravating circumstances.
1.9.3. Con: Even though disenfranchised, felons are treated just like everyone else in society. As long as the same behavior leads to the same sentence and, subsequently, to disenfranchisement, there is no inequality among the members of a society.
1.9.4. Con: -> See 1.8.9.2.
1.9.5. Pro: Permanent felony disenfranchisement for all ex-felons would apply the same blanket punishment to a very diverse set of crimes, with no regard for mitigating factors. This would be an arbitrary punishment.
