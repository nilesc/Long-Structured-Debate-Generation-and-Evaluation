Discussion Title: Does Feminism Empower Both Women And Men?

1. Feminism empowers both women and men
1.1. Con: The goal of feminism is gender equality, but only issues which equalize by empowering women are a part of feminism. Empowering men can hold the same goal, but isn't part of feminism.
1.1.1. Pro: Feminism fails to address crucial challenges men face.
1.1.1.1. Pro: [Life expectancy](https://www.wikigender.org/wiki/gender-differences-in-life-expectancy/) for male humans is significantly lower than for female humans. Yet, this isn't high on the agenda.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Men are much more likely to die at work, an issue not commented on in the feminist movement. [bls.gov](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/cwc/fewer-women-than-men-die-of-work-related-injuries-data-show.pdf)
1.1.1.2. Pro: Males suffer from [toxic masculinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemonic_masculinity#Toxic_masculinity).
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Combating toxic masculinity is part of present-day feminism.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: Feminism challenges the [patriarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy) which is the root [cause](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/toxic-masculinity-dark-side-patriarchy-lbkr/) for [toxic masculinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemonic_masculinity), which in turn is a [cause](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/cou-cou0000176.pdf) for the higher risk of suicide amongst men.
1.1.1.3. Con: There is [male privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege) and therefore it is in the overall interest for both genders to level the playing field first.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: Female privilege also exists in some forms. Even if male privilege is more prolific, gender inequality is not solely one-directional, and thus ignoring male's rights in the name of female's rights fails to serve the goal of gender equality.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: For example, custody courts are more likely to rule in favor of women than men. As a [Florida State University Law Review](https://ir.law.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1419&context=lr) states "...the presumption in favor of mother-custody continues to prevail..." \(pg. 920\).
1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Many courts today have adopted the "primary caretaker" factor, which tends to favor women because they still tend to be a child's primary caretaker. Thus, the favor of mother-custody is not a manifestation of "female privilege," but rather of the obligations still socially thrust upon women.
1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: There are numerous reasons why the primary caretaker standard favors women. Not every reason is due to lower fitness of the father to care for the child.
1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In cases with newborn children, the primary caretaker standard naturally favors women since \(cis-gender\) men are physically incapable of nursing the child and thus don't have the same forces putting them in contact with the child.
1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Statistically](https://www.oecd.org/els/family/LMF_2_1_Usual_working_hours_gender.pdf), women work fewer hours than men, meaning they're at home and in contact with the child more regularly, which leads to them being favored by the primary caregiver standard.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Men are at [higher risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide) of death by suicide than females.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.
1.1.1.5. Con: By empowering women, more minds can be applied to problems that do effect men. Thus, feminism at least transitively addresses challenges that men face.
1.1.1.6. Con: There are movements which can address men's issues. Feminism is not the right movement to address these problems.
1.1.1.6.1. Con: This argument seems to support the conclusion that feminism does not empower men, which is the point it was meant to argue against.
1.1.1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.
1.1.1.8. Con: Feminism's discourse has brought about discussions that directly impact both men and women. Though an imperfect instrument for dealing with male specific issues, feminism benefits men by attempting to wrestle with issues around gender roles, masculine ideals, feminine ideals, and societal expectation. All of which indirectly affect men and contribute to men's issues. These discussions have opened up conversations around men's issues, as such indirectly helping society deal with male issues.
1.1.2. Con: Feminism deals with male issues through conversations around gender roles and cultural expectations of the sexes. These conversations lead to a raised consciousness of issues facing males in society.
1.2. Pro: Men can actively participate in the movement.
1.2.1. Con: Participating in the movement is not necessarily empowering to men.
1.2.1.1. Con: Non-participation denies feminism a male voice within the movement, therefore, denies feminism any potential avenues of male empowerment.
1.2.2. Pro: Men being able to actively participate in the movement provides them with a avenue for voice and civil participation.
1.2.3. Con: This uses up time that men could spend participating in movements that actually empower men.
1.2.3.1. Con: Only participating exclusively in either men's or women's movements ignores the cultural, political, and societal interplay these movements have with each other.
1.3. Con: Some women do not want men to perceive feminism as empowering to men because it would underime the fundamental idea of feminism.
1.3.1. Pro: Feminism is a response to the perceived imbalance in power between men and women in society. If it empowers them equally then it is not actually changing that imbalance. Therefore in order for feminism to work it has to empower women more than men.
1.3.2. Con: Feminism can still be empowering to men- it just differs in the ways that it empowers each sex, because each sex faces different issues of dis-empowerment.
1.4. Pro: Feminism' strengthens the foundations of committed heterosexual couples.
1.4.1. Pro: Couples benefit from increased, combined economic prospects, wealth, and contribution.
1.5. Pro: Feminism has allowed for more economic, social, and political opportunities for both men and women.
1.5.1. Pro: Feminism has helped foster a culture in which occupations that once were considered for one sex or another can now be held by someone of either sex.
1.5.2. Pro: Feminism has opened the doors to political activism and office-holding for women.
1.5.3. Pro: Feminism, which encouraged and encourages women to vote, means that both male and female candidates have more potential supporters, providing both with greater possibilities and opportunities.
1.5.4. Pro: Both men and women are empowered by those things which benefit society as a whole. Society as a whole benefits greatly by perfect social capitalization \(when all individuals are able to achieve their full potential\). Feminism, by removing barriers to the success of women, enables better social capitalization; thereby benefiting society as a whole and empowering both men and women.
1.6. Con: Feminism focuses on rights, which always come with responsibility. Responsibilities are not the focus of the movement and this hurts both men and women.
1.7. Pro: It is desirable for feminism to be empowering to men.
1.7.1. Con: Just because it's desirable for feminism to be empowering to men doesn't mean it is empowering to men.
1.7.2. Con: Many feminists find it undesirable for feminism to be empowering to men.
1.7.2.1. Pro: It is unfair to dilute the efforts of feminists into something that benefits both men and women, when their efforts have been pointedly for the progress of women.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: The progress of women is beneficial to men.
1.7.3. Pro: If feminism is empowering to men, it allows for a more fair and equitable society, without it starting to grow imbalanced in either direction.
1.7.4. Pro: In order to make feminism more attractive to both sexes, people should be encouraged to talk about it more in terms of its capacity to empower men, as well as women.
1.7.4.1. Con: This doesn't address how feminism empowers men and women.
1.8. Con: It is false to think that feminism can empower men.
1.8.1. Con: This is more of an opinion than an argument; many men may find feminism empowering, as it affords them equality and the ability to be more 'effeminate' without suffering negative social consequences.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.10. Con: Feminism was created only for the equality of men and women. Not for the empowerment of men.
1.10.1. Con: That feminism was created for equality purposes does not mean that feminism does not ultimately empower men.
1.10.2. Con: Equality means both sides have the same feelings of empowerment and capability, it would not be true feminism to allow this on only side or the other.
1.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.
1.11. Pro: The belief system of feminism may well be based on the idea that: both sexes are equal, thus feminism empowers men, as well.
1.11.1. Con: Empowering women with the goal of gender equality is the idea of feminism. Empowering men can hold the same goal, but isn't a form of feminism.
1.11.1.1. Con: 'Empowering' men does not mean giving them more power than women, nor that - in becoming empowered - their roles will be imbalanced. It just means they'll be equally empowered in their lives and able to pursue their futures with equal opportunities.
1.11.1.1.1. Pro: For men to be empowered in feminism, the precondition should be that men understand that feminism was created as a movement to build more equal opportunities for women, to begin with. Therefore, by understanding the fundamentals, men are empowered to create more room for women's opportunities in the world, as well as to help more women's voices be heard whenever and wherever it is necessary to do so.
1.11.1.1.2. Con: The parent claim doesn't say that empowering men means giving them more power than women. In fact, it acknowledges that equality is the goal of feminism.
1.11.1.2. Con: If a culture is considered imbalanced in favour of masculinity, then feminism could be considered as a process to be applied to that culture, rather than as an opposing side within some kind of binary power struggle between two halves of a population.
1.11.2. Pro: Most would agree with this definition.
1.11.3. Pro: Feminism is literally [defined as](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/feminism) "the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men" - it is unequivocally going to have an impact on men.
1.12. Con: It is unimaginable that feminism is about men at all.
1.12.1. Con: Just because it's difficult to imagine something doesn't mean it's untrue.
1.12.1.1. Con: Unimaginable probably means it's untrue though. Or at least untrue to people.
1.12.2. Pro: Male empowerment from feminism seems like hijacking the movement for their own ends.
1.12.3. Pro: It is quite literally in the name: feminism. Male interests are secondary, if addressed at all.
1.12.3.1. Pro: "Femi"-"nism": Female Theory.
1.12.3.2. Con: Names are not the sole and often are not the primary determinant of what an organization or movement does or is about. [The Democratic People's Republic of Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea#Government_and_politics), despite it's official name and establishment, are hardly visible as a democracy. Similarly, the Nazi party was the ["National Socialist German Workers' Party," which was by no means socialist.](https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/09/05/were-nazis-socialists/)
1.12.3.3. Con: Taking the etymological definition as defining the movement's core tenets ignores any paradigm shifts associated with the movement's history and any linguistic semantic drift within the movement. It's a false presupposition.
1.12.4. Pro: Men already have power.
1.12.4.1. Pro: There has never been a woman President of the United States.
1.12.5. Con: If it were unimaginable, this discussion would not exist.
1.12.6. Con: Feminism is a movement that has evolved significantly through history. It is true to say the initial movement did not deal with men's issues and was aimed at the empowerment of women. This is not true now, modern feminism deals more generally with attempting to find equality of the sexes, questioning cultural norms. Both of which affect males.
