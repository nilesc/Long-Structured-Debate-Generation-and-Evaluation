Discussion Title: Should We Ban Symbols of Communist Regimes?

1. We Should Ban Communist Symbols
1.1. Con: There are positive aspects of communism, such as gender equality.
1.1.1. Pro: Highlighting symbols can be used to commemorate the achievements of communist regimes.
1.1.1.1. Con: The achievements of Communist regimes are not accepted as being positive overall.
1.1.2. Pro: In a communist society, everybody has equal access to healthcare, education and employment.
1.1.2.1. Con: This occurs in European democracies too and so is not solely a feature of Communism.
1.1.2.2. Con: Communist nations only offer those services to their citizens while they have the resources to do so.  On average that's about 80 years, or one reasonably long human lifetime.  When they run out of resources, everyone suffers equally.  Essentially one generation of people gets to enjoy the fruits of other people's labor before it all comes crashing down.[Tim Lambert on various Collapses](http://www.localhistories.org/communism.html)[Collapse of communist regimes in Europe](https://www.cvce.eu/en/education/unit-content/-/unit/1f5d29d1-bc79-44af-ae41-6fdb3f41608e/de5ef049-acec-4e19-983c-27104320cd2b)
1.1.2.3. Pro: This might not apply at all or be all that beneficial to citizens of communist countries who are sent to prison or labor camps for crimes of expression or non-violent political activity, which are otherwise protected behaviors in non-communist countries that are democracies of some form. The point being that the negative consequences caused by the oppressive nature of communist regimes outweighs the material benefits provided by them to their citizens
1.1.3. Pro: In a communist society, the government owns and controls all businesses, so there is no cut-throat business competition and no one manufacturer monopolises any industry.
1.1.3.1. Con: The benefits and disadvantages of state versus private ownership are debatable. History has shown that state owned industries are less productive and less profitable than the privately run. Under Communism, the state runs the monopoly on all industries - this has no different an effect than a monopoly in the private sector except that there is no mechanism to dissolve such a monopoly.
1.1.4. Con: There are positive aspects of Nazism too, that's still a reprehensible ideology, just like communism.
1.1.5. Con: Gender equality is not a virtue which Communism may claim as a feature of its ideology and no other. Other political systems including those to which Communism is diametrically opposed achieve the same.
1.1.6. Pro: Some believe that communism is inherently good for everybody and should be the ultimate goal of the human society. Therefore its symbol shouldn't be banned. The usage of the same symbols by some countries that tried to put the achievement of Communism in their goals is irrelevant on the long term. Since none of these societies ever got close to Communism, conflating Communism together with these specific experience is naiveté.
1.1.7. Pro: The core of the communism is the timeless striving of the human race for fairness and equality, well-being at no-one's expense, freedom from slavery, and human brotherhood, honest work for the benefit of society, as is symbolized by the hammer and the sickle.
1.1.8. Con: This does not negate the history of communist symbols; specifically, that it has allowed for the mass murder of ethnic groups and other working class members that were more hesitant about the "revolution".
1.2. Pro: People within Eastern Europe etc. still suffer with the living memory of the regimes that oppressed them, and the use of these symbols often romanticise genocidal regimes.
1.2.1. Con: Eastern European former Soviet states overall want the Soviet Union back. Most Russians too miss the socialist model and the USSR, despite the struggles with capitalists, famines, fascists, prevention of a new civil war, and paranoia, the living conditions got better and socialism got the economy thriving.

[Russians want USSR back #3](https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Poll-Most-Russians-Prefer-Return-of-Soviet-Union-and-Socialism-20160420-0051.html)
1.2.1.1. Con: The former Soviet states want a return to influence and cultural meaning that has been lost with the onset of Westernisation. This is falsely conflated with a wish to return to Communism.
1.2.1.2. Con: Outside of Russia and some culturally Russian regions in surrounding states there is no desire to return to Communist rule.
1.2.2. Pro: The fact that these countries often seek to remove symbols of the USSR etc. is shown by the attempts of Eastern Europe to remove statues etc also glorifying the regime.
1.2.2.1. Con: There is a difference between a statue actively glorifying members of the regime and a symbol that was simply utilised by it.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: The [symbols are also being removed](https://sputniknews.com/europe/201710201058418089-poland-hammer-sickle-war-graves-removal/) such as the hammer and sickle being removed from war graves in Poland.
1.2.3. Con: This could be said of most flags, since many countries actively exterminated populations on their territory or waged imperialist wars that caused deaths in other countries: USA, UK, Japan, Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Brazil and so on.
1.2.4. Con: This is debatable: [Are people worse off than under communism?](http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/legacy/267-09.gif), from [this Pew Research.](http://www.pewglobal.org/2009/11/02/end-of-communism-cheered-but-now-with-more-reservations/)

As you can see most people there aren't really suffering with the living memory, many are even nostalgic and remember the economic growth.
1.2.5. Con: The hammer and sickle etc. don't represent genocide, but worker liberation and anti-capitalism.
1.2.5.1. Pro: The Red Army was about trying to prevent the poor from starvation and oppression, and is a symbol of rising up against your oppressors.
1.2.5.2. Con: Yet we must not forget about the minority groups and opposition groups \(or even people that didn't want to actively be part of the revolution\) that were killed during the 1917 revolution and its long lasting effects for these groups that can still be seen in their political upset in modern day Russia.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: The Leninist method of the establishment of socialism and Stalinist methods of maintaining it should not justify censorship of the socialist ideology itself.
1.2.5.2.2. Con: Ideologies themselves should always be open to critique and defense; banning symbols representing an ideology is a first step to censorship and preventing people from educating of the subject, which is a policy only prone to backfire on itself - especially during recessions and overall unhappiness of a society.
1.2.5.3. Con: Some symbols cannot be reclaimed. The crude symbolism of the hammer and sickle is irrelevant when taken in the context of the behaviour of the political system it represents. To compare, the Swastika is a pagan peace symbol but that is not what it now represents and it cannot be rehabilitated to its previous meaning.
1.3. Con: This undermines the principal of freedom of expression.
1.3.1. Pro: [Article 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_10_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights) of the European Convention on Human Rights provides European citizens with the right to freedom of expression, which includes "the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers". This right would be breached if people were not allowed to hold and/or impart communist ideas via the use of communist symbols.
1.3.1.1. Con: There is no inherent right to freedom of expression, especially when it can cause fear and limit freedom of expression in other marginalised groups.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Marginalised groups in the developing world often use these symbols to gain mobilisation, even if the symbol has horrible implications these groups don't have the political capital to create new symbols that people will recognise and get behind.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: There is an inherent right to freedom of expression. The only situation when the freedom should be restricted is when the expression directly promotes violence. How does symbols of communist regimes directly induce violence?
1.3.2. Con: Freedom of expression is already accepted to have limitations, and these symbols, as with the swastika, are often used as propoganda tools and this should be combatted.
1.3.2.1. Con: To censor an ideology often backfires on itself, over time creating an environment with a temptation for conspiracism and offensive actions against censorship justified by demand for free speech.
1.3.2.2. Con: The best way to neutralize a bad idea is by making fun of it. The best way to give a bad idea power is to ban it.
1.3.2.3. Con: To censor certain symbols goes against the basic principles of freedom of expression.
1.3.3. Con: Even the principal of freedom of expression has its own limits, such as directly calling violence to someone or yelling a false "fire" situation in a closed, crowded, space. Communism is a violent, uneven system that bases itself in violence.
1.4. Con: Communist symbols are now often used as "memes" and aren't used to spread hate, promote genocide etc. so don't have the same impact.
1.4.1. Con: They are also often used by communists.
1.4.2. Pro: The Jakarta Lonely Council of Struggle, a Facebook fan page that often parodies the famous quotes of well-known figures, posts various memes related to the hammer and sickle, some of which went [viral](http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/05/13/when-hammer-and-sickle-symbol-becomes-funny-memes.html) in 2016.
1.4.3. Con: The proponents of Communism even today advocate violent revolution in its name. This has exactly the same impact as the promotion of fascism or racial supremacy.
1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.
1.5. Pro: The Communist manifesto \(Marx\) insists that its implementation must be by violent revolution. This is still how many advocates of Communism envisage its introduction. Communist symbols are used as rallying points for this unacceptable notion and should be removed as they are likely to incite hate, division and fear.
1.5.1. Con: The Communist Manifest does not refer to a violent revolution. It just says the oppressed people should come together, unite and change the system, but not by violence.
1.5.1.1. Con: "The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained[only by the forcible overthrow](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/overthrow) of all existing conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. [WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch04.htm)" -page 77 of [The Communist Manifesto a modern edition](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/communist-manifesto-karl-marx/1100038601/2693555014622?st=PLA&sid=BNB_825204424&sourceId=PLAGoNA&dpid=tdtve346c&2sid=Google_c&gclid=Cj0KCQjwguDeBRDCARIsAGxuU8bTczkpNfwsqH9L2ySCC0ySfHRfeXtTiAY-2JgTQbWB1Agt61GVrPMaAoNCEALw_wcB)
1.5.2. Con: The Communist Manifesto is old and outdated in some aspects. Communism has evolved and incorporated democracy.
1.6. Pro: Communism has proved to be equally harmful to human societies and far more genocidal than Nazism. A failure to ban the symbol of this demonstrably destructive and failed totalitarian ideology when the symbols of other similar ideologies have been -rightfully- banned already grants Communism an unwarranted and harmful validity. This could give people a false impression of what views are politically acceptable today.
1.7. Con: Banning these symbols erases parts of history and means that we can less effectively demonstrate the prevalence of symbols and how they can be used as propaganda.
1.7.1. Pro: Education is the most effective tool to combat any attempts by extremist groups to utilise communist symbols to gain members.
1.7.1.1. Pro: And with education, the whole truth must be viewed and analyzed. Censorship only promotes bias and deteriorates objectivity and skepticism.
1.7.1.2. Con: Education can be used for both good and harm. Indoctrination in institutions can shape a specific world view that may corroborate with extremist groups.
1.7.1.3. Con: Education itself plays a role in an individual's psyche. So do societal issues that are re-occurring pressures, such as poverty and perceived injustice. Any extreme ideologies that offer promises of solace or salvation will be enticing enough to refute logic in a perceived irrational world.
1.7.2. Con: The existence of these symbols means that groups can use them as notable iconography for recruitment. This means that by banning these symbols recruitment can be limited.
1.7.2.1. Con: However, extremist groups often don't want to use symbols associated with genocide etc and so would rather try to find other more innocous symbols for recruitment.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: Communism in Western countries is often viewed with more sympathy than, say, Nazism. This means that they often are not forced to "hide their power level" in the same way and instead use these symbols openly and gloss over the less "marketable" parts of the symbol's history.
1.8. Pro: Communism is inherently evil and the promotion of it is abhorrent so we should minimise the glorification of it as much as possible.
1.8.1. Pro: It stands for economic ruin, starvation, oppression and genocide, all ideas that should be condemned and not promoted.
1.8.1.1. Con: Socialism/Communism represents equal ownership of the means of production. It is fallacious to redefine it.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: It is equally fallacious to willingly ignore or overlook the detrimental realities of such a theory.
1.8.1.2. Con: If one cannot effectively argue how socialism/communism inevitably leads to "economic ruin, starvation, oppression and genocide", one should not promote censorship of the subject.
1.8.1.2.1. Con: It is simple to prove: communism means [economic ruin](https://fee.org/articles/the-collapse-of-communist-economic-theory/), [starvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_famine_of_1932%E2%80%9333), [oppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression_in_the_Soviet_Union) and [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes). Examples are easy to find.
1.8.1.3. Pro: The North Korean concept of Juche - [inspired by](https://maoistrebelnews.com/2013/05/31/what-is-the-juche-idea/) communist, Marxist-Leninist ideology - has led to the country's isolation from the rest of the world and has enabled the continuation of the dictatorial, oppressive North Korean regime.
1.8.2. Con: Communism isn't evil and tries to combat the harms of capitalism and its impact on the most vulnerable in society. It stands for economic equality which is something that should be celebrated- hence why the symbols should not be banned.
1.8.2.1. Con: Communism means more than that as it is a complete social and economic model based on rigid societal and market controls. Like any other form of political organisation, its beneficial aspects are offset by its other inescapable shortcomings.
1.8.3. Con: Claiming a political belief to be inherently evil is wrong and short sighted. Even with a belief as terrifyingly murderous as communism.
1.8.3.1. Con: If the results in practice of any belief system, no matter how well intentioned, are that people die, starve, and are oppressed on a scale heretofore unseen, that indicates that the belief system itself or the philosophy underlying it are either inherently evil or simply wrong. To put into practice that which is known to result in that kind of evil is, in itself, evil.
1.8.3.2. Con: This is a strange form of logic. If a political system rests on genocide or oppression, then it can be easily painted as what it is: inherently evil.
1.8.3.2.1. Con: Communists in fact fight for the working person, saying no to capitalism while abolishing private property and having a planned economy. This is explained in the [communist manifesto.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Manifesto.pdf) "In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.
