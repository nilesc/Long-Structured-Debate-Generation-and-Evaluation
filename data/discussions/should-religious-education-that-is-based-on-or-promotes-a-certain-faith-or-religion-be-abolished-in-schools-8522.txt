Discussion Title: Should Religious Education that is Based on or Promotes a Certain Faith or Religion be Abolished in Schools?

1. Religious education that is based on or promotes a certain faith or religion should be abolished in schools.
1.1. Con: Abolishing faith based education would cause a great deal of political upheaval and popular resistance.
1.1.1. Pro: A ban on religious education could be seen as an interference with the principle of [freedom of religion](https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/human-rights-act/article-9-freedom-religion).
1.1.1.1. Con: Freedom of religion is about personal freedom. Children, being people, each have their own freedom of religion. Proselytising them while they're impressionable impinges on that freedom.
1.1.1.2. Con: This depends on the interpretation of the right as freedom can imply both negative and positive freedom. Where negative freedom indeed implies that government cannot force you to \(not\) believe, positive freedom implies every individual is free to choose what they want to \(not\) believe. Monotheistic religions are therefore also not in rule with the essence of religious freedom as they claim it is 'impossible' to leave the religion in one way or another.
1.1.2. Pro: The last [census](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/religion/articles/religioninenglandandwales2011/2012-12-11) in England and Wales found that in 2011 there were 33.2 million Christians \(59.3% of the population\) and 2.7 million Muslims \(4.8% of the population\). It is therefore likely that the overwhelming majority of the population would be opposed to the abolition of religious schools.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Currently around one-third of state-funded schools in England have a faith designation, with the the vast majority of them being Christian. This illustrates that the state currently supports the idea of religious education - a change in this longstanding policy would most likely cause upheaval. \([House of Commons Briefing Paper](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06972/SN06972.pdf), p. 4\)
1.1.2.2. Con: This is a logical flaw, one can be religious but be against religiously inspired education at the same time, the two are not mutually exclusive.
1.1.3. Pro: According to the [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/), 70.9% of the US population is Christian. It is therefore likely that the majority of the American population would be against the abolition of faith based education.
1.1.3.1. Con: Only those Christians who are biased against those they consider infidels would be opposed. The others would recognise that their children don't have to believe what they believe.
1.1.3.2. Con: Saying that one is Christian does not automatically lead to them being in favour of Christian-led education systems. This is a logistic flaw in your argument.
1.1.4. Con: There has been [widespread opposition](http://www.educationengland.org.uk/articles/26blairfaith.html) to faith schools in the UK for decades, and the matter of how faith schools are funded and run continues to be intensely scrutinised. Abolishing them would undoubtedly cause problems, but the protesters would likely be a minority.
1.1.4.1. Pro: As far back as 2005, [two thirds](http://www.educationengland.org.uk/articles/26blairfaith.html) of those questioned of the general public agreed that the UK government 'should not be funding faith schools of any kind'. This is also backed up by a survey of teachers, of whom nearly half felt there should be fewer, or no, faith schools.
1.1.5. Con: Certain countries - including Greece, Norway and Luxembourg - have no faith schools, yet consistently score [extremely highly](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/dec/07/world-education-rankings-maths-science-reading) in international education league tables. They have not suffered extensive political upheaval nor resistance, and indeed seem to be thriving.
1.1.6. Pro: The 10th amendment allocates school decisions to states \("Please note that in the U.S., the federal role in education is limited. Because of the Tenth Amendment, most education policy is decided at the state and local levels." - [ed.gov](https://ed.gov/policy/landing.jhtml?src=ln)\)  Thus no federal law could be made to abolish faith based education.
1.1.7. Con: Doing the right thing should not be avoided just because others will express disagreement.
1.1.8. Con: There have been many decisions in the past that have caused great political upheavel or resistance \(abolishment of slavery, women's voting rights\), that does not mean the goal is illegitimate in essence.
1.2. Con: Abolishing faith based education would require abolishing faith based schools, which are often high performing schools that provide quality education.
1.2.1. Con: All individuals, regardless of their faith, should be able to access an outstanding school. If faith based education results in individuals being denied entry to the best schools in their area, simply because they do not subscribe to the same religious beliefs as the school, that is wrong, and a form of discrimination.
1.2.1.1. Con: In the UK at least, faith schools - regardless of their academic credentials - [cannot discriminate](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06972/SN06972.pdf) against certain students in the first instance, but only if they are oversubscribed. Any given school has oversubscription criteria, especially the 'best' schools - it simply happens that in faith schools, that criteria is religion, rather than, say, catchment area.
1.2.1.2. Pro: [One study](http://humanistlife.org.uk/2014/06/23/ten-facts-about-faith-schools/) found that 99.8% of places at Catholic schools, 100% of places at Jewish schools and 94.9% of places at Muslim schools were subject to religious selection criteria, regardless of location.
1.2.2. Pro: Strong values in a faith-based school can directly contribute to the quality of teaching and outcomes; the theory is that religion helps in 'constructing a strong connection between leader and followers, which in turn raises the motivation and ability of the follower to achieve more'. \([p. 10](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/cubec/migrated/documents/leadershipandfaithschools.pdf)\)
1.2.2.1. Con: This is not unique to faith schools; leaders with strong values, regardless of religious orientation, are able to achieve the highest results.
1.2.3. Pro: Faith based schools provide [better](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/08/29/faith-schools-are-beacons-of-intellectual-rigour/) education and the students achieve better results as compared to their [secular](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/secondaryeducation/3852653/Faith-school-pupils-outperforming-others-at-every-age.html) counterparts.
1.2.3.1. Con: The higher performance of students in faith-based schools is the [result](http://epi.org.uk/report/faith-schools-pupil-performance-social-selection/#) of admitting more affluent, high-attaining pupils than non-faith schools, while taking on a lower proportion of the poorest and most disadvantaged pupils.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Additionally, faith schools have substantially lower rates of admission for SEN \(special educational needs\) students, which would naturally affect their performance records. \([p. 7](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxL3m2uvdxMea2F1X0liT2JMSG5kYjJKaVN1akpSWjBLSEh3/view)\)
1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: This is not universal; [in Wales](http://learning.gov.wales/docs/learningwales/publications/130425-faith-in-education-en.pdf), an agreement was struck with one faith school to build an entire additional SEN unit, build on the school's ethos and specialising in students with educational needs.
1.2.3.2. Con: Many faith based schools provide misinformation and omission of subject matters due to religious beliefs. This could arguably prove them to provide a lesser education.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Faith based education curriculum is often problematic.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: Religious education does not tend to include comprehensive [sexual education](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/opinion/the-worlds-problem-with-sex-ed.html), which can have wide ranging effects on the health and emotional wellbeing of the students.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: A survey found that 75% of young gay people have experienced direct homophobic bullying in faith schools. Seven out of ten of these bullied pupils said the bullying had an impact on their work and performance at school, and half of those bullied have skipped school because of it. \([Stonewall guide, p. 4](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/sites/default/files/working_with_faith_communities.pdf)\)
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: [UK legislation](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/sites/default/files/working_with_faith_communities.pdf), including the Public Sector Equality Duty, requires all public bodies \(including schools\) to eliminate discrimination, advance equality and foster good relations. This means that UK schools are by law required to tackle bullying and discrimination.
1.2.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: According to a survey, only one in five gay pupils have learnt about safe sex in relation to same-sex relationships. Although this problem is not exclusive to faith schools, they are even less likely to provide such information than their non-religious counterparts. \([Stonewall report, p. 4](http://www.stonewall.org.uk/sites/default/files/the_school_report_2017.pdf)\)
1.2.3.2.1.1.3. Con: [In the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/schools-to-teach-21st-century-relationships-and-sex-education), teaching sex and relationship education is compulsory in all schools, including faith schools. The latter have flexibility in how they teach - in accordance with the tenets of their faith - but ultimately still must conform to certain governmental standards.
1.2.3.2.1.1.4. Con: Faith based schools do offer a comprehensive education of sex from their own definition of healthy sexual relationships. Secularists simply take issue with what these faiths define as the appropriate sexual relationship designed by God. From this perspective, the “comprehensive” sexual education received in secular institutions is far more harmful than beneficial for youths.
1.2.3.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: In the worldview of Christianity, God determines moral values and duties. Departure from God’s plan isn’t simply wrong, it is harmful because it robs humanity of the best life they were designed for. Thus, from the Christian perspective, encouraging sinful acts like fornication, adultery, homosexuality and other forms of sexual expression outside of God’s definition is actually very unloving. It encourages people to live a life that is ultimately harmful to them.
1.2.3.2.1.2. Con: It is not permissible, in UK schools, for creationism to be taught as an evidence-based theory, but rather a theory exclusively restricted to religious study lessons. This is indicative of a wider appreciation by external bodies that faith schools do not have free reign to teach as they please. \(Faith Schools in England, [p. 10](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06972)\)
1.2.3.2.1.3. Con: Faith schools may have a number of biases in their teaching, but remain accountable; for example, it is perfectly possible for a faith school to not support same-sex marriage. However, they are still duty-bound to provide an education that instils '[respect for other people](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06972), even if one does not agree with them or their way of life'. As long as this is maintained, faith based curricula can prove itself unproblematic \(p. 14\).
1.2.3.2.1.3.1. Con: Regardless of their duty or lack thereof, schools don't provide any education that instils respect for other people except incidentally. Teachers don't have time to digress, nor is it their job to do so.
1.2.3.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Teachers do have a responsibility to instill good values within students and model good behavior because ethics are essential to every discipline they teach.
1.2.3.2.1.4. Pro: Religion teaches us to believe, that is to make unfounded assumptions. Boolean algebra teaches us the opposite, to not make unfounded assumptions. Teaching contradictory positions in different classes could lead students to doubt either or both and further erodes the credibility of education, which kids have enough trouble grasping at the best of times.
1.2.3.2.1.4.1. Con: Not all worldviews define faith as “blind” or some unwarranted assertion. The Christian view of “faith” includes the use of reason and logic. Christ’s representatives are commanded by scripture to use their minds to discern truth \([Matthew 22:37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A37&version=NIV), [2 Timothy 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+3%3A16&version=ESV), [1 Timothy 4:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+4%3A13&version=ESV), [15-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+4%3A15-16&version=ESV), [Ephesians 5:15-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A15-17&version=ESV)\). Christian faith includes an intellectual pursuit of who God is, the world He created, and the reasons for our faith \([1 Peter 3:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A15&version=ESV)\). Reason and logic are necessary to accomplish this task.
1.2.3.2.1.4.2. Con: It is teaching that religion is blind faith that undermines intellectual rigor. Teaching instead that religion must be studied and reasoned about promotes a consistent world view instead of a bifurcated “faith vs reason” approach.
1.2.3.2.1.5. Con: If equity of the presentation of worldviews \(meta- narratives\) is really the goal, this must be a requirement for all institutions including secular public schools. Secularism is not a neutral position in spite of it always being presented as such. It is a worldview and thus should be subject to the same rules as schools run by other worldviews. Thus if education of all worldviews is required in faith based institutions, it must also be required in secular institutions also.
1.2.3.2.1.5.1. Con: Presenting the world narratives of scientific fact and faith based belief as equals is absurd. Some faith based narratives do not contradict scientific fact, but most do. We do not concern ourselves with providing "equal" consideration of both flat earth and sphere earth theories because only one is consistent with the truth.
1.2.3.2.1.6. Pro: Religion in a public school either has to be very watered down, or too sectarian.  It's not likely that people would insist on inserting their religion in a public school in this day and age, but if they were to, this would not be acceptable. Church schools are their option. Today in countries where there used to be one main religion, we find many Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus. How could a teacher assigned to teach a course on religion deal with this diversity?
1.2.3.2.1.7. Pro: Faith-based schools promote religious education, and religious education may promote the idea that fantasies and myths are "realities", [which lead to children having difficulties in discerning Fact from fiction \[see article\]](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-28537149)
1.2.3.2.1.8. Con: Secular education has similarly problematic curricula.
1.2.3.2.1.8.1. Pro: Common Core has not be well received by many, as is documented by several press outlets.
1.2.3.2.1.9. Pro: Children in faith based schools are often not taught secular subjects. This has far-reaching negative outcomes.
1.2.3.2.1.9.1. Pro: Nearly 50,000 [yeshiva students](http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/naftuli-moster-thousands-ill-educated-yeshiva-boys-article-1.2521951) in the New York City area are not taught science, history, and geography, amongst other subjects.
1.2.3.2.1.9.2. Pro: These children are at a disadvantage in their job market prospects and miss out on fulfilling careers in STEM \(science, technology, engineering, and math\) fields, all of which require a solid foundation in secular subject matter.
1.2.3.2.1.10. Pro: Faith based schools often use textbooks that are directly contradictory to science.
1.2.3.2.1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.9.2.
1.2.3.2.1.10.2. Pro: Children in [Christian schools](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/rosetta-stones/a-travesty-of-an-education/) throughout America and the United Kingdom use textbooks written from a Biblical literalist viewpoint and are taught that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old and that Noah’s flood is the event that formed most of the geologic record.
1.2.3.2.1.10.3. Pro: There is an [institutional distrust](https://www.bjupress.com/pdfs/ed-issues-whitepapers/secular-textbooks.pdf) of scientifically correct \(or at least secular\) textbooks, in part because they provoke independent thought that would 'waste time' in the classroom.
1.2.3.2.1.10.4. Pro: Many Catholic schools use [non-accredited science books](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/roy-speckhardt/religious-schools-are-fai_b_9431334.html), such as Science of the Physical Creation in Christian Perspective, that inject religious ideology into “lessons” about science.
1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.2.5. Con: Using the performance of faith schools to champion their continued existence is difficult to accept when we know those factors are at least partly incidental. With no faith schools, those incidentals \(e.g. parents who care more about the childrens' education\) would be applied to non-religious schools.
1.2.6. Con: This may not be a bad thing as education segregated on the basis of faith undermines community cohesion. These schools will likely be replaced by secular schools which would accommodate a more diverse student base.
1.2.6.1. Con: Abolishing religious education that promotes a certain faith would interfere with the right to cultural self-determination of many minority communities.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Contained within many religious identities is a shared history and culture. Interfering with the ability of a community to pass this shared history and culture down from generation to generation is unacceptable.
1.2.6.1.1.1. Pro: For many minority religions especially, their shared history and culture can be enmeshed in a collective trauma, and religious education and instruction can play an integral part in aiding the communal processing of this trauma.
1.2.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: A hugely important part of much education in Jewish religious schools concerns engaging with the many horrors that people of the Jewish faith have undergone over the centuries, especially the Holocaust, and attempting to come to terms with it. \([Davidowitz, 2013, p,19-21](https://www.bjpa.org/content/upload/bjpa/c__c/Davidowitz_Capstone_Final2.pdf)\)
1.2.6.1.2. Pro: Under a [communitaraian](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/communitarianism/) approach to rights, it is illegitimate for a government to impose such a policy on a community against its will, even if such a policy could notionally maximise individual liberty or well being in other ways.
1.2.6.1.2.1. Pro: A society based on individual choice to the detriment of community cohesion becomes excessively atomistic, as members of that community become increasingly distant from one another. Allowing communities to pass on their cultural and religious heritage as they see fit is one of the best ways to ensure this cohesion.
1.2.6.1.2.2. Con: Communitarianism is an illiberal philosophy with a number of troubling, often authoritarian, implications.
1.2.6.1.2.2.1. Pro: Emphasis based on 'community cohesion' above all else can very easily facilitate, and has done in the past, a huge amount of suffering on the part of individuals.
1.2.6.1.3. Con: Cultural self-determination when that includes a religion is religious tyranny, in that as part of the community each person is expected to be in the religion, religious laws can curtail freedom and infidels can be ostracised or mistreated.
1.2.6.1.4. Con: This statement is self contradictive: by definition, promoting a certain faith in education will interfere with the right to cultural self-determination of many minority communities. Self-determination is most likely guaranteed by educational neutrality on the matter.
1.2.6.2. Pro: Faith based schools promote segregation.
1.2.6.2.1. Pro: Religious education enforces a distinction between 'us' and 'them'. In areas where religious division is already a problem \(e.g. Northern Ireland\) faith based education allows it to filter down to children, making communities even more divided.
1.2.6.2.1.1. Con: In the case of Christianity, this is untrue. This worldview teaches that all mankind has fallen short of the glory of God and has collectively become separated from God. Christianity teaches that sin is the problem and it affects everyone. This understanding \(in most individuals\) fosters understanding and patience with people from other worldviews, for Christians themselves recognize they themselves \(the Christian\) struggle deeply with sin even after experiencing salvation.
1.2.6.2.2. Pro: Schools - faith or otherwise - are [not permitted](https://rightsinfo.org/uk-allow-schools-discriminate-due-religion/) to discriminate on the grounds of race or ethnicity yet, de facto, faith schools often find themselves segregated from other ethnicities. Thus the end result is segregation not only of religion, but of race.
1.2.6.2.2.1. Con: It is possible this has much more to do with culture overall than faith alone. Religion is one aspect of culture. Culture is far more broad than religious practices so it is unjustified to fault faith for this.
1.2.6.2.2.2. Con: As immigration and multi-culturalism increases, these concerns will be be diminished. For example, many evangelical churches and the schools they sponsor in the state of Maryland are incredibly diverse because the entire area is diverse.
1.2.6.2.3. Pro: Faith schools sort students by creed, facilitating political intolerance. Students therefore do not interact with others who have different views. On the other hand, secular schools have more diverse enrollments, allowing students to learn how to coexist with others, develop political tolerance, and foster social cohesion. \([Cheng, pg. 2](http://www.uaedreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cheng_EDRE_2013_06.pdf)\)
1.2.6.2.3.1. Con: Stopping entire schools from teaching the worldviews they believe in to the children assigned to their care is at root incredibly intolerant of these worldviews. If a school believes teaching alternative worldviews is harmful, then to not allow them to uphold that belief is intolerant. Since this solution is itself intolerant, one cannot appeal to enhanced tolerance from its effects. It is hypocritical.
1.2.6.2.3.2. Con: Religious values are not always inherently misaligned with political tolerance. Catholic schools and Protestant Schools often have the objective of developing civic mindedness within their students. \([Bowen, pg. 8](http://www.uaedreform.org/downloads/2014/03/edre-2014-01.pdf)\)
1.2.6.2.3.2.1. Pro: Religious schools and public schools provide similar civic preparation and religious schools “do no worse” than public schools in preparing students for democratic participation. \([Giersch](https://csrs.nd.edu/evaluations/vouchers-for-religious-schools-and-the-development-of-democratic-values/)\)
1.2.6.2.4. Pro: Segregation is problematic as it normalises and promotes interracial and faith prejudices.
1.2.6.2.4.1. Con: There is little to no evidence suggesting that integration would solve the issues of interracial or faith prejudices; indeed, the best way to combat prejudice is "through academic teaching in schools rather than the naive laissez-faire approach which assumes that mere exposure and contact with ‘difference’ will resolve prejudices". As such, it does not matter if faith based schools are themselves segregated, as long as their anti-prejudicial teaching is sound. \([p. 12](https://www.uel.ac.uk/wwwmedia/microsites/riste/Article-2-Ameen-and-Hassan.pdf)\)
1.2.6.2.4.2. Con: All education is based on or promotes a certain system of belief. 'Secular' education incorporates no fewer suppositions than faith-based education.
1.2.6.2.4.2.1. Pro: In the words of John Stuart Mill: 'Every education system makes use of indoctrination’. Those who attend secular schools are being indoctrinated into a secular way of thinking, just as faith school indoctrinate students into their own faiths. As such, concerns about indoctrination in schools are redundant. \([p. 14](https://www.uel.ac.uk/wwwmedia/microsites/riste/Article-2-Ameen-and-Hassan.pdf)\)
1.2.6.2.4.2.2. Con: The nature of a secular education, as distinct from an atheist education, is that it does not assume a particular answer to any religious question and says that different religious beliefs, as well as lack of religious belief, are all legitimate. Even if this itself requires its own system of belief, it is still one where there is more room for choice and no proscribed truth.
1.2.6.2.4.2.2.1. Con: A secular education hides its prejudices and presuppositions behind a sham impartiality, and is therefore more insidious in its ability to promote a narrow and intolerant worldview. "The finest trick of the devil is to persuade you that he does not exist." - Charles Baudelaire
1.2.6.2.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: Faith \(worldview\) and education cannot be separated, and those who claim otherwise merely hide their faith, or worldview, behind presuppositions taught as absolute truth. Often this leads to a more chaotic and dissonant attempt at education, as individual educators and institutions try to present their own worldviews as assertions reconciled to tolerance and openness. Religious education, on the other hand is, is open and honest about foundational presuppositions, therefore easier to critique.
1.2.6.2.4.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: The ability to mask the presuppositions of secular education as absolute truth in this way become all the more enhanced if all other forms of education are banned. Even if you are given a secular education in the status quo, the very existence of religious forms of education challenges the objectivity of your own education, meaning you are more likely to question it than if religious education did not exist at all.
1.2.6.2.4.2.2.1.1.2. Con: This argument is a typical case of false equivalence. Secular education at least makes a serious attempt at being balanced and neutral, where religious education is grounded in dogma from the start.
1.2.6.2.4.2.3. Con: The idea that belief is necessary for knowledge is unfounded. Belief is unfounded assumption, exactly the sort of illogical behaviour teachers should be warning their students against.
1.2.6.2.4.2.3.1. Con: All claims to knowledge, if we are to avoid skepticism, must be founded on beliefs that cannot be proven and for which there can be no evidence. For example, the very belief that I am interacting with a physical reality as I type this comment is a belief that cannot be proven. It must be assumed true a priori.
1.2.6.2.4.2.4. Con: The assumptions made in the sciences aren't always explained immediately, but that doesn't mean they haven't been proved.
1.2.6.2.5. Pro: At primary level in the UK, faith schools are more likely to cater to more advantaged students from higher socio-economic strata. These schools take considerably fewer students who are eligible for free school meals than their neighbouring non-faith schools \([p. 16](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxL3m2uvdxMea2F1X0liT2JMSG5kYjJKaVN1akpSWjBLSEh3/view)\).
1.2.6.2.5.1. Con: This is likely a symptom of schools being private rather than being attached to faith. If faith schools were abolished, wealthy parents would still send their children to private schools and the demographic segregation would continue.
1.2.6.2.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.2.6.2.6. Con: Many Christian schools teach that under God all people are created equal. All people deserve dignity as image bearers of God.
1.2.6.2.7. Con: Many faith based schools are from minority religions. The use of coercion to prevent these communities from educating their children in their faith is likely to be perceived as an attack on their identity by their host state. This means that minority religious communities are more likely to ghettoise and otherise themselves, leading to more socio-economic and ethnic segregation.
1.2.6.2.7.1. Con: The children from minority religious communities will come into contact with others from different backgrounds and via the children so will their parents. This can counterbalance the withdrawal because of a perceived attack on their identity.
1.2.6.2.8. Con: Ethnic self-segregation is not bad. Individuals have a right to associate with who they wish.
1.2.6.2.8.1. Con: A faith based school denies the child the opportunity to associate with members of a different faith or of no faith at all.
1.2.6.2.8.2. Con: While individuals have a right to choose who they associate with, it is not the child who chooses which school they enter, but their parents. A parent should not be able to prevent their children from mixing with people from other religions or groupings as this will affect their social development.
1.2.6.2.9. Con: Religious schools reduce socio-economic and racial [achievement gaps](https://www.heritage.org/education/report/religious-schools-help-close-the-achievement-gap) and provide greater benefits to students from the poorest families and minority students.
1.2.6.2.9.1. Pro: Religious educators are most likely to believe that children, no matter what their colour or background, can achieve and reach great potential. Consequently, they are more likely to have high expectations and insist that these students take demanding courses. \([pg.22](http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Jeynes-Meta-Analysis-of-Public-Public-Charter-and-Religious-Schools.pdf)\)
1.2.6.2.9.2. Pro: Urban minorities in USA receive significant benefits from Catholic schooling because their public-school alternatives are substantially worse than those of whites or other minorities who live in non-urban areas. African-American and Hispanic students in urban areas benefit most from attending Catholic schools, achieving higher graduation rates from high school and college than students from similar backgrounds who attend public schools \([Neal, p. 4](http://www.nber.org/papers/w5353.pdf)\).
1.2.6.2.9.3. Con: This is a symptom of the state shirking its responsibility and an argument for an increase in funding for public education. This would be a more universal response to this problem, as opposed to being only available to people who happen to live near enough to faith schools willing to take them.
1.2.6.2.9.4. Con: This is only true if the faith in question is a minority faith. In Ireland the "[Baptism Barrier](https://www.equateireland.ie/single-post/2016/08/19/What-does-the-Baptism-Barrier-really-mean)" in Catholic Schools caused many minority faith groups difficulties in finding educational facilities who would accept their children.
1.2.6.2.10. Pro: By taking in one to five times the number of white students as neighbouring non-faith schools, the potential for these non-faith schools to be mixed substantially decreases \([p. 15](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxL3m2uvdxMea2F1X0liT2JMSG5kYjJKaVN1akpSWjBLSEh3/view)\).
1.2.6.2.10.1. Pro: Faith schools at primary level in the UK are more ethnically segregated than schools of no faith \(28.8% of faith schools compared with 24.5% of those of no faith\) when compared with neighbouring schools. It is a similar picture at secondary level \([p. 15](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxL3m2uvdxMea2F1X0liT2JMSG5kYjJKaVN1akpSWjBLSEh3/view)\).
1.2.7. Con: The success of faith based schools is often at the expense of other schools in the area. Surrounding schools are less able to attract high quality students and teachers, as a result of which the quality of education provided to the majority of students who attend non faith based schools suffers.
1.2.7.1. Con: Far from attracting only high quality teachers, faith schools have marked problems with retaining staff, partly because they tend to hire teachers from their own faith, so have access to a far more limited pool. \([p. 16](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/cubec/migrated/documents/leadershipandfaithschools.pdf)\)
1.2.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.2.10.
1.2.8. Pro: Abolishing faith based schools will reduce the choice of schools available to parents.
1.2.8.1. Pro: If schools do not provide students with religious education that promotes their faith, many parents will choose to home school their children instead. This is likely to result in worse outcomes for the child.
1.2.8.1.1. Con: Educational outcomes for homeschooled children are [better](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/) than that of children in public and religious education.
1.2.8.1.2. Con: Children's right to a quality education should regulate the quality of their education no matter where they get it from. If homeschooling is permitted, it should meet some quality criteria. Parents may pass their religion on to their kids, but not at the expense of education and knowledge.
1.2.8.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.1.1.
1.2.8.2. Con: Choice for one group is often at the expense of another. Since faith based schools choose their pupils, parents might be unable to access their local schools, or the best school in their area, due to religiously selective admissions policies. This decreases choice for the majority of parents, unless they are prepared to join, or pretend to join, a religion. \([pt.7](http://humanistlife.org.uk/2014/06/23/ten-facts-about-faith-schools/)\)
1.2.8.3. Con: This assumes that faith schools will shut down. Instead, they would likely be converted to schools without a religious identity, but with other characteristics to define them. The number and diversity of school choices is not dictated by religion.
1.2.9. Con: Religious schools can abolish their religious programme, becoming secular schools, and continue with their quality, secular programme.
1.3. Pro: Religious education that promotes a particular faith interferes with the right of a child to choose their own faith.
1.3.1. Con: Religious education can help children develop stronger ties with their families. If the children are brought up and educated according to the religious beliefs of their parents and wider family there is less scope for family fractures.
1.3.1.1. Con: If the child in some way does not fit in to the expectations of their parents religion, such as if they are LGBT, this could make them feel isolated and judged and cause family fractures.
1.3.1.2. Con: Intolerant people cause family fractures over religion. Difference of religion is just the catalyst.
1.3.2. Con: Children will never be able to 'choose' their future beliefs \(including faith\) in any meaningful sense because they will always be moulded by the environment they grow up in, whether that be a strictly religious one or a more liberal one. This is true whether or not they attend a faith based school.
1.3.3. Con: Schools tend to shape and mould a child's future beliefs in lots of different ways other than just religious, yet nobody would say that this deprives the child of the ability to decide their own stances on these issues. It is unclear what the distinction is between these kinds of beliefs and religious belief.
1.3.3.1. Con: The issue is not the 'shaping and moulding' of religious beliefs, but the outright decision to assign a certain faith to a child. Children are given much less scope to develop their own ideas of religion if they are subjected to only one faith throughout their education - the same is unlikely to happen in the case of other types of views.
1.3.3.2. Con: Maths, chemistry, physics, computer science, assorted languages, history, geography, physical education - none of these teach or espouse belief, they teach facts and logic.
1.3.4. Con: Since it is impossible for young children to decide their own faith, that decision has to be made for them. As parents make decisions that are in the child's best interest, they should be allowed to choose the faith of their child.
1.3.4.1. Con: While it is true that we can not expect a child to choose what education they would want it is also true that we have a responsibility to educate a child correctly as we are choosing for them. Due to the fact that no religion has been indisputably proven correct, no religion should be a part of an educational curriculum above other religions.
1.3.4.2. Con: It's entirely practical to not make the decision for them.
1.3.4.3. Con: Parents make decisions that they hope are in the child's best interest. That's not necessarily the same as making decisions that are actually in the child's best interest, particularly when they're making a decision based on what they believe, as if belief is not unfounded assumption but fact.
1.3.5. Con: Once they have developed their autonomy, children are more likely to develop an informed view of their parents’ religious doctrine if they have immersed in it as participants during their early years. The systematic religious instruction in a religious school ensures that the children of religious parents have an adequate understanding of their family’s religion, so that their subsequent assessment—and perhaps rejection—is based on appropriate understanding and acquaintance. \(Macmullen, [pg.8](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3779/598567743eb6862023bf21e9d9d7aec0db70.pdf)\)
1.3.5.1. Con: Not everyone is capable of looking past ingrained, conditioned belief.
1.3.6. Con: All education promotes a particular worldview, and therefore interferes with presupposed "Right of a child to choose their own faith" \(or worldview\).
1.3.6.1. Con: Religions are only a subset of worldviews. Freedom of religion does not extend to all worldviews.
1.3.6.2. Con: Neither foreign language classes, physical education nor music promote a worldview.
1.3.6.3. Con: The sciences don't promote a worldview, as we're entitled to our own opinions, but not to our own facts.
1.3.6.4. Con: Any suitably diverse literature, art, history or geography curriculum promotes many worldviews.
1.3.7. Con: -> See 1.2.6.2.4.2.
1.3.8. Pro: Students are sometimes [forced](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/catholic-schools-force-students-to-study-religion-despite-court-order/article19998101/) to spend a significant part of their time studying the particular faith of the school, even when the students and their parents object.
1.3.8.1. Pro: This is especially harmful for non-faith students studying in these schools, as it not only deprives them of time they could dedicate to other subjects, but it forces them to learn and imbibe the values and teachings of a particular faith when they do not want to.
1.3.8.2. Con: In the UK, any parent is legally able to withdraw their child from religious education lessons, and are not obliged to give a reason. As such, children may access schools but not be forced to attend lessons that contradict their familial viewpoints. \(Faith Schools in England, [p. 6](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06972/SN06972.pdf)\)
1.3.9. Pro: Children too young to make a responsible choice to smoke, drink, own a gun, marry, or have sex aren't old enough to make a responsible choice to believe, and once they do they're stuck with it for years, or maybe forever if they're not capable of reevaluating it later once they're no longer impressionable.
1.3.9.1. Con: People change their religion in their youth and early adulthood all the time.
1.3.10. Con: Secular education can also contain bias that limits an individual's ability to choose a worldview.
1.3.11. Con: Children are the responsibility of their parents until they reach adulthood, at that point it's proven that they choose away. Some leave and some stay.
1.3.12. Pro: As it would be clearly wrong to assign certain hobbies, interests or ideas to children at birth and then educate them according to these labels, it is wrong to do the same with [religion](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/dec/30/schools.religion).
1.3.12.1. Con: In the same way it is not wrong to teach a child to ride a bicycle, and encourage them in that hobby, it is also not wrong to teach them about faith.
1.4. Con: Faith based education is an important way of teaching students about religion, especially those from religious backgrounds.
1.4.1. Pro: Faith-based education can be useful for minority groups whose faith is not recognized, or is actively discriminated against, by the state. This is true in Egypt where the Coptic Christian minority is actively the target of sectarian violence and even the laws for building and legalizing churches and mosques are unequal. Without faith-based education of their own, Coptic christians would have no other oulet, as the state takes no responsibility for providing this in civil society.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Education about the faith as part of a general religious education course or program in a school or to a wider community might provide more and wider understanding and empathy, and give minority faiths such as Coptic Christians a greater sense of identity.
1.4.2. Con: A generalised 'religion' subject can be a core part of any curriculum. There is no reason this subject needs to be based on one religion alone in order for children to get this kind of education.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Yes, the good way to go with it is to talk about several religions, not to stop at only one. Ex. how family or other values are seen in diferent religions
1.4.3. Con: Faith based schools promote only their particular religion and discourage learning from/about other religions.
1.4.4. Con: Children from religious backgrounds can be educated in religion outside of school. There is no reason for it to be a part of their school curriculum.
1.4.4.1. Con: Faith based education in schools has to abide by national laws and standards. As a result of this, it is often more tolerant than versions of faith that students encounter at home. Religious education that promotes faith can challenge prejudiced views and misunderstandings of faith that students may have previously encountered.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: It doesn't have to be religious education that promotes faith - it could just be religious education about the faith.
1.4.5. Con: Religions may be taught from a historical point of view, as a part of the development of human societies, as religions did play a huge part in our history. Religions themselves, however, do not preach truth, and truth is the main concern of knowledge and therefore of educational establishments.
1.4.5.1. Con: “Religions themselves...do not preach truth” is an unwarranted assumption and therefore fallacious. The epistemological standard used for such an exotic conclusion is unclear. Moreover, there is no evidence given for this assertion.
1.4.5.2. Con: Religions/worldviews are meta-narratives that attempt to explain the nature of the reality everyone experiences. Each worldview thinks their meta-narrative is the truth. Secularism is not the default worldview to be considered as “truth.”
1.4.5.3. Con: Religious history alone is inadequate to capture the complete teachings of any given worldview. Each worldview must be allowed to present a comprehensive defense for its position as a meta-narrative. The content must be developed by the religion in question or else it is not a “fair” or “true” representation of that worldview.
1.4.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.
1.5. Pro: Religious education should be taught in mythology class. There are already available institutions \(church, synagogue, mosque, etc\) outside of school that teaches a single specific religion and is available to everyone. So there is no need for schools to focus on educating people in one single religion as if it is true.
1.5.1. Con: Thousands of years of debate cannot settle the existence of a God nor prove/disprove divine revelation however years of documentation and a rich history of religious artifacts and information prove that existence of religion is not a myth.
1.5.2. Con: Reading/writing, math, etc. can be taught at home, at churches, places of employment, or in private institutions. So there is no need for schools.
1.6. Con: Alternatively, we could abolish all public schools and use their funds as subsidies for private education. Then every parent can choose what religion \(or lack thereof\) their child is exposed to, fully satisfying Separation of Church and State.
1.6.1. Con: Segregating education based on religion would only exacerbate coexistence problems between religious groups.
1.6.2. Con: Increase cost for parents.
1.6.3. Con: Some public schools allow a religious time where children are seperate into what religion they want to learn about. Making all schools private would force children to learn about which ever religion the school chooses, if they only allow one.
1.7. Con: Western Liberal Democracies are not in the practice of restricting non-violent religious activity. To do so would be to erase separation of church and state, and violate free expression and free speech principles.
1.7.1. Pro: Asking whether a democracy should regulate religious activity is like asking whether a referee should join the game he or she is judging. It negates his position as the referee. In the same way, any democracy that violates its definitive principles ceases to be a democracy.
1.7.1.1. Con: A more apt way of putting is that the people who make the rules of a sport can decide if something is illegal or not. If it is has become illegal then players aren't allowed to perform it anymore. The real world equivalent would be how the government could decide to stop allowing schools to have religion in their curriculum.
1.7.2. Con: State schools are already paid for by the state and the supreme court [has already decided](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2017/06/27/can-religious-schools-receive-state-funds-supreme-court-gives-qualified) that religious schools are able to receive funding by the state. Thus the notion that state and church are separate is false.
1.8. Pro: Faith based education leads to an overly narrow and more intolerant worldview amongst its students.
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.
1.8.2. Pro: Faith based education promotes indoctrination of students.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Education should encourage the development of rational and moral autonomy. Faith based schools do the opposite and limit the autonomy of a child by implanting beliefs that neither empirical evidence nor rational argument might change.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: Secular schools are preferable to religious alternatives for the purpose of cultivating children’s autonomy since there is a need for an educational environment that is detached from the ethics of children’s religious parents and communities in order to give those children the critical distance necessary for autonomous reflection about their primary ethical culture of upbringing. \([Garnder,1988](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=5Hucu2AbIL0C&pg=PA163&lpg=PA163&dq=Gardner,+1988+child%27s+autonomy&source=bl&ots=e_cSNd4rb2&sig=kZ10a0oxVafWtdjuo342Lmfhsvs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjn7PqEnfvYAhUP36QKHYVjCPAQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&q=Gardner%2C%201988%20child's%20autonomy&f=false)\)
1.8.2.1.2. Con: Cultural coherence is a prerequisite for autonomy and religious schools play an important part in cultivating ethical autonomy in the children of religious parents.
1.8.2.1.2.1. Pro: “Membership in a community and embeddedness within a cultural and normative framework is a primary need of individuals—and an essential prerequisite for autonomy. One cannot act autonomously if one has no firm structure of beliefs on which to act” \(Levinson, [pg. 56](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=GykSDAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA56&ots=80Px0mCmgd&dq=%E2%80%98membership%20in%20a%20community%20and%20embeddedness%20within%20a%20cultural%20and%20normative%20framework%20is%20a%20primary%20need%20of%20individuals%E2%80%94and%20an%20essential%20prerequisite%20for%20autonomy.%20One%20cannot%20act%20autonomously%20if%20one%20has%20no%20firm%20structure%20of%20beliefs%20on%20which%20to%20act&pg=PA56#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%98membership%20in%20a%20community%20and%20embeddedness%20within%20a%20cultural%20and%20normative%20framework%20is%20a%20primary%20need%20of%20individuals%E2%80%94and%20an%20essential%20prerequisite%20for%20autonomy.%20One%20cannot%20act%20autonomously%20if%20one%20has%20no%20firm%20structure%20of%20beliefs%20on%20which%20to%20act&f=false)\).
1.8.2.1.2.2. Pro: Religious schools consolidate each child’s grasp of their primary culture and begin the process of ethical reasoning within it, long before s/he is cognitively equipped to engage in fully-fledged autonomous reflection.
1.8.2.1.2.3. Pro: It is important to consolidate a young child’s primary culture by designing the school experience to harmonize with and reinforce the ethical messages s/he receives at home to promote emotional security and appreciation for the role of personal values. Children need a secure and stable provisional ethical identity as a point of departure for the journey to autonomy.\(Macmullen, [pg.3](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3779/598567743eb6862023bf21e9d9d7aec0db70.pdf)\)
1.8.2.1.2.3.1. Con: This identity shouldn’t be so firmly rooted that it becomes immune from future reflection and revision, as is the case with religious education.
1.8.2.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: There is often strong resistance by religious people towards changing some religious beliefs, even when faced with discrediting information. \([Batson](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=Vn5XObcpnd4C&pg=PA204&lpg=PA204&dq=batson+1975+religion&source=bl&ots=eSbz3P2Lld&sig=uW6uyHLIaff9SLfu4q0XeiXfBU4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQ2La0lvvYAhUH2o8KHdzVCAAQ6AEINDAC#v=snippet&q=Batson%201975&f=false)\)
1.8.2.1.2.3.2. Pro: For the young child of devoutly religious parents, a school with a secular curriculum, diverse membership, and an absence of religious reasons in its pedagogical methods of motivation and justification can be a profoundly disorientating place. The total absence of familiar and reassuring religious language and cues disturbs the young child’s fragile sense of self and sows confusion and discord rather than coherence and stability. \(Macmullen, [pg.4](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3779/598567743eb6862023bf21e9d9d7aec0db70.pdf)\)
1.8.2.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.
1.8.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.1.2.3.1.1.
1.8.2.1.4. Con: Autonomy need not be pursued through schools at all, since children can be expected to develop it through their encounters with diverse ideas outside of and after school.
1.8.2.1.4.1. Con: Autonomy is absolutely vital in schooling, from the earliest stages of childhood development; this is supported in a [broad range of studies](http://www.earlychildhoodnews.com/earlychildhood/article_view.aspx?ArticleID=607), that between them credit autonomy in a learning environment as vital for self-esteem, cognitive and moral development, understanding responsibility, and maximising academic progress. No school - faith or otherwise - can shirk the responsibility of allowing children autonomy.
1.8.2.2. Pro: The phenomenon of "[Catholic Guilt](http://mirandacelestehale.net/2011/09/06/the-serious-consequences-of-childhood-religious-indoctrination/)" has been attributed to childhood Catholic indoctrination.
1.8.2.2.1. Pro: This can be especially damaging to members of the LGBT community.
1.8.2.2.1.1. Pro: LGBT persons who mature in a religious community [report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4706071/) experiencing increased discrimination and internalised homophobia.
1.8.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Research [\(Rowley, pp.10\)](http://esource.dbs.ie/bitstream/handle/10788/3106/hdip_rowley_d_2016.pdf?sequence=1) found that participants who identified as being religious were generally more prejudiced towards homosexuals than participants who identified as being non-religious.
1.8.2.2.2. Pro: The term “Catholic guilt” is generally used to describe the feelings of remorse or conflict in people who are or were raised Catholic. It suggests that even if you do not continue in the faith as an adult, a strict emphasis on sin as a child can often follow you in later life.
1.8.2.3. Pro: Some religious doctrines are the result of centuries of perfection and are powerful psychological and mass control tools; any child's mind is susceptible to forms of control. [\(Koenig, 2012\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3671693/)
1.8.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.
1.8.2.5. Con: It has been seen in recent studies that [genetics](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7147-genes-contribute-to-religious-inclination/) can be a more important factor in a person's religiousness rather than their childhood education.
1.8.2.5.1. Con: "Genes may help determine how religious a person is" This article talks about religious inclination, not on a specific religion. By educating children in only one religious system we deny them the opportunity too choose and explore, therefore develop their religious inclination.
1.8.2.6. Con: Faith based education often asks students to explore their faith and to question it.
1.8.2.6.1. Con: While this may be true of some religious education, it greatly depends on the organisation running it. Faith based eduction gives the organisers the power to indoctrinate their students as they have no responsibility to educate them in different religious thoughts or question their own.
1.8.2.6.1.1. Pro: [In the UK](http://High-profile cases of harassers or rapists being fired would indicate to victims who hear about them that their accusations will be treated seriously at work.), religious study in faith schools is not monitored by Ofsted, but by religious bodies of the requisite faith. What constitutes 'good' religious education lessons in faith schools has more to do with inculcation than academic integrity; faith schools have an unacceptable carte blanche to do as they wish.
1.8.2.6.2. Pro: For example, in the classroom, students will often be asked to study different religious scholars and come to their own conclusions. This is not the same as indoctrination.
1.8.3. Con: Even if faith based education can initially lead to a very narrow world view, it can in the future facilitate a more open minded attitude. If a child ever grows up to question their faith, which often forms the very foundation of their worldview, then the implications of that by necessity requires them to question all of their other attitudes.
1.8.4. Con: This indicates a gross misunderstanding of the tenets of religious belief. Every major religion holds equality, respect, kindness and acceptance as fundamentals. Religious schools that truly reflect their respective religions would utterly reject any intolerance.
1.8.4.1. Con: Each religious school that truly reflects their religion would indeed embrace tolerance, but the form of tolerance it would embrace would be shaped by absolute belief that its religion is correct. This would result not in the unbiased form of tolerance regarding things that you'd just prefer weren't the case, but intolerance.
1.8.4.2. Con: Each [major](https://quran.com/2/221) religion's beliefs are in direct [contradiction](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+6%3A14&version=NIV) to equality, respect and acceptance with regard to non-believers.
1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.2.6.2.4.2.
1.8.6. Pro: Faith based schools, particularly Islamic ones, can teach students a particularly conservative and rigid set of cultural values that make integration in diverse communities difficult.
1.8.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.2.3.
1.8.8. Pro: Following a certain religion is a personal choice and to make such a choice one should be fully informed about all religions. However, school doesn't teach them all, and therefore is imposing the choice on the individual by limiting his knowledge field
1.8.9. Pro: [Studies](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/danthropology/2015/11/study-finds-that-children-raised-without-religion-show-more-empathy-and-kindness/) have found that children without a religious upbringing are more likely to display empathy and kindness while "children from religious households are harsher in their punitive tendencies.”
1.8.9.1. Pro: If somebody believes that a particular action or set of activities are not only wrong but in direct opposition to God, it is understandable that their reaction to it would be harsher and more punitive.
1.8.9.2. Con: In the study, altruism was calculated as the number of stickers shared out of 10. This does not remotely capture all the nuances of what could be considered “altruism.”
1.8.9.3. Con: Within the study, religiosity in the children was identified by measuring their parents who gave a subjective judgement on how religious their household was. These are highly subjective judgements upon which to base the study. For example, one of the questions was, “how often do you experience the Divine in your everyday life?” These measures of religiousity are based on pseudo-quantified answers.
1.8.10. Con: -> See 1.4.4.1.
1.9. Con: Faith based education is an important part of proselytising efforts of religious institutions, something these institutions have a right to do.
1.9.1. Pro: Freedom to proselytize is a necessary component of religious practice as many religions count teaching the faith amongst the principal duties of believers.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Many Christians consider it their obligation to follow what is often termed the [Great Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Commission) of Jesus, recorded in the final verses of the Gospel of Matthew: "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen."  \([Matthew 28:19-20](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%2028.18%E2%80%9320)\)
1.9.1.2. Pro: Inviting people to the religion is a meritorious activity in Islam. Muslims consider inviting others to Islam a collective duty as it is the mission originally carried out by the Prophets of Allah. The Quran says: "Invite to the Way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them \(non-believers\) in ways that are best and most gracious..." \([An-Nahl: 125](https://quran.com/16/125)\)
1.9.1.3. Pro: The endeavor to attract people to the religion is strongly emphasized in the writings of the [Baha'i Faith](https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/quotes/the-baha-i-international-community-on-proselytism). Every Baha'i has the [obligation](https://science-train.com/w/Proselytism/Bah%C3%A1'%C3%AD%20Faith.html) of teaching their religion.
1.9.2. Pro: The right to religious freedom, which is included in several international treaties, includes the freedom to proselytize.
1.9.2.1. Pro: The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights \(UDHR\) states: "Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance." \([Article 18](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html)\)
1.9.2.2. Pro: [Article 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_9_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights) of the European Convention on Human Rights and [Article 18](http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide a right to religion which includes the freedom to change a religion or belief, and to manifest a religion or belief in worship, teaching, practice and observance.
1.9.3. Con: Proselytization should be, and in many countries is, restricted if it is aimed at vulnerable populations. Proselytization therefore should not be directed at schoolchildren who are unable to opt out of it.
1.9.3.1. Pro: State laws in India have penalties for conversions of people assumed to be particularly vulnerable. The Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Forcible Conversion of Religion Ordinance includes a penalty providing higher punishment for those forcibly converting minors, women, or Scheduled Castes or Tribes. \([Ahmad, pg.11](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/anti-conversion-laws/india-state-anti-conversion-laws.pdf)\)
1.9.3.1.1. Pro: Similarly, the Himachal Pradesh legislation builds on the prior legislation in other states by including increased fines for cases involving certain vulnerable groups and the requirement to seek permission prior to conversion.\([Ahmad, pg.14](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/anti-conversion-laws/india-state-anti-conversion-laws.pdf)\)
1.9.3.1.2. Con: The Indian laws do not apply to parents raising their children in their own faith.
1.9.3.2. Con: Banning the proselytization of children would require forbidding parents from passing their religious beliefs on to their children. Enforcement of such a ban would require pervasive control over family interactions.
1.9.3.2.1. Con: That doesn't mean that we have to be complicit in the proselytization of the vulnerable.
1.9.4. Pro: From the understanding of many religions, a failure to instill the right faith in the children of their community could lead to the damnation of their eternal souls. Proselytising in this manner therefore must be something they are free to do.
1.9.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.
1.9.5. Con: Using children to gain long term power should not be a right.
1.9.6. Con: Parents can still educate their child in the faith of their choosing outside the auspices of the school system, so it is unclear which right is being violated here.
1.9.7. Con: Proselytizing for certain religions could be harmful to humankind if the religion supports ideals that are not beneficial to humankind.
1.10. Con: Parents have a right to educate their children in the faith of their choice. Without faith based education, this right is compromised.
1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.
1.10.2. Con: This right is not absolute. It has to be balanced against the child's right not to be harmed. As an extreme example, parents do not have the right to bring up a child in a faith that requires this child to be sacrificed or forced into sex.
1.10.2.1. Con: It is true that the basic human rights of children should not be violated by any system of belief \(including secularism\). However, the burden of proof that a particular faith causes harm to children is on those making such a claim. It is far from apparent that this is the case.
1.10.3. Con: A school may not represent all families' religions, in which case it would interfere with the parental right to teach children their own religion.
1.10.4. Con: -> See 1.9.6.
1.10.5. Con: Parents may pass their religion on to their children, but they do not have the right to let religion get in the way of or mixed up with education. They should happen as separately as possible, as faith jeopardizes the logical and critical thinking required by actual knowledge.
1.10.5.1. Con: Logic and critical thinking are impossible without foundational knowledge. If truth is relative, then there is no "actual knowledge," but merely circular reasoning and personal preference. Faith, whether correct or incorrect, asserts foundational knowledge, and therefore serves as a starting place to employ logic and critical thinking
1.10.5.1.1. Pro: The fundamental propositions of logic and rationality themselves require faith to be accepted. One cannot justify the use of logic through logic without collapsing into tautology.
1.10.5.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.2.4.2.2.1.1.
1.11. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.2.
1.12. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.
