1. What is the best method for solving a Rubik's cube?
1.1. CFOP
1.1.1. Pro: It is the most popular.
1.1.1.1. Pro: It wouldn't be popular without good reason; there is evidently an element that appeals to people more broadly than other methods.
1.1.1.2. Con: Popularity does not dictate efficacy.
1.1.2. Con: Move count is higher than others.
1.1.2.1. Con: With practise and improved speed, this becomes less of an issue.
1.1.3. Pro: It is an easier transition from the "Beginner's Method".
1.2. Roux
1.2.1. Pro: It is intuitive.
1.2.2. Pro: It is rotationless.
1.2.3. Con: M-slice moves are awkward.
1.2.4. Con: A single incomplete M-slice move is a DNF rather than merely a +2.
1.3. ZZ
1.3.1. Pro: It is rotationless after edge orientation.
1.3.2. Con: EOLine is hard.
1.4. Petrus
1.4.1. Con: Block building is hard.
1.4.1.1. Con: No Rubik's cube is supposed to be 'easy' to solve, more that one becomes increasingly practised. As such, it doesn't matter that block building is tricky.
1.4.2. Pro: It is intuitive.
