Discussion Title: Is A Hot Dog A Sandwich?

1. A hot dog is a sandwich
1.1. Con: Sandwiches have two \(or more\) pieces of bread - a hot dog does not.
1.1.1. Con: Sub sandwiches are often made from one piece of bread split, but not detached, the same as a hot dog bun. Therefore, a hot dog can be classified as a sandwich.
1.1.2. Con: There is an entire subset of foods called [Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_sandwich) Sandwiches which do not have 2 pieces of bread but are still considered sandwiches.
1.1.3. Con: The [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sandwich) defines a sandwich as two or more slices of bread, or a split roll having a filling in between, or one slice of bread covered with food.
1.1.4. Pro: It does not matter that the bread is connected as other sandwiches also have connected bread.
1.1.4.1. Con: By this definition, all foods with some edible substance packed inside connected pieces of baked goods, including burritos, hot pockets, or donuts with filling, are all sandwiches.
1.1.4.2. Pro: A hot dog is on a split roll, just like a Lobster Roll, which is always classified as a sandwich.
1.2. Pro: Hot dogs are eaten the same as a sandwich.
1.3. Pro: Bread on both sides and a filling in the middle equals a sandwich.
1.3.1. Pro: If the anecdotal \([www.wyzant.com](https://www.wyzant.com/resources/lessons/english/etymology/words-mod-sandwich)\) history is to be believed, the fourth Earl Of Sandwich "ordered a waiter to bring him roast-beef between two slices of bread...He apparently had the meat put on slices of bread so he wouldn’t get his fingers greasy while he was playing cards". His reasoning was paramount therefore any filling placed between bread which then protects the fingers qualifies.
1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.4. Con: The official Hot Dog And Sausage [hot-dog.org](http://www.hot-dog.org/culture/hot-dog-sandwich) Council refutes the claim of sandwich-hood.
1.4.1. Pro: The fact that there is a national council for hot dogs but not sandwiches clearly delineates the two as separate forms of foodstuff.
1.4.2. Pro: They classify the hot dog as being part of their [own category](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/11/07/a-hot-dog-is-not-a-sandwich/75362898/).
1.4.3. Con: Hot dogs have been around before the council, therefore the council cannot be the authority on if it is a sandwich.
1.5. Con: Hot dog fans organized petitions and eventually were granted a new hot dog emoji. There was already a sandwich emoji. Why would it be necessary if a hot dog were a sandwich?
1.5.1. Con: Things of a same type have different sub-emojis. There are many varieties of flags and people.
1.6. Pro: Meat only sandwiches are common, and hot dogs can hold many other toppings.
1.7. Con: A hot dog is actually a taco.
1.7.1. Con: A [taco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco) is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled with a meat filling. A hot dog does not fit this description, nor did it originate in Mexico.
1.7.2. Con: A taco is also a sandwich.
