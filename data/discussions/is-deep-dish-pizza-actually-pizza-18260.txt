1.1.1. Con: A large number of 'normal' pizzas also have large numbers of toppings.
1.2. Pro: One thing that does not vary in pizza recipes is the way you cook them. Most pizzas call for as hot of an oven as possible and cook in less than a few minutes. Only deep-dish pizzas are baked for 20-30 minutes.
1.3. Pro: There are recipes similar deep-dish pizzas with other names like pie.

1.7. Con: Deep-dish pizza has all the ingredients that regular pizza has.
1.8. Con: Pizza is in the name.
1.9. Con: Pizza has come in a variety of shapes and recipes since it's inception in Italy.
