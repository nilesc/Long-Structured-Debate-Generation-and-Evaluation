Discussion Title: FairTax would improve the current US taxation system.

1. Implementation of the [FairTax](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/25) will improve the current US taxation system in a variety of ways, such as strengthening the Gross Domestic Product by improving Net Trade, Savings, Personal Consumption and Government Expenses. [More details on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairTax).
1.1. Con: Any unforeseen need for additional revenue would have to come with a broad increase in taxes for everyone.
1.1.1. Con: But that's a good thing. Spreading out tax increases to everyone means only a relatively-small amount of money is needed from everyone in order to collect a large amount of money. Plus, you're not forced to pay taxes - you can buy used products and reduce reliance on services to lower what you pay in taxes.
1.1.1.1. Con: Spreading the income tax burden would increase tax burden on the working poor. Instead, we should be keeping their burden low to increase their available income, [which increases overall economic demand](http://www.freeeconhelp.com/2012/02/how-change-in-income-changes-demand-and.html), which increases overall quantity supply \(in most cases\). Such a change should, in theory, pull [human resources to meet quantity supply increases](https://muddywatermacro.wustl.edu/demand-supply-unemployment).
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [relatively regressive nature of the Fair Tax system](https://www.kialo.com/fairtax-would-improve-the-current-us-taxation-system-2813/2813.0=2813.1-2813.4) would impose a greater share of the tax burden on the poor.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The greater share of income available to the poor is more than offset by a decrease in purchasing power under the Fair Tax due to the 23% \(or [probably much more](https://www.kialo.com/fairtax-would-improve-the-current-us-taxation-system-2813/2813.0=2813.1-2813.7)\) tax rate on purchases.
1.1.2. Con: Very often sudden expenditures are paid by deficit spending.
1.1.3. Con: Because of its transparency a FairTax would be less rigid to change. After all, only one tax would need to change rather than many.
1.1.3.1. Con: The business exemptions seems far from transparent. Quite the contrary, it seems intentionally vague. Determining which activities are exempt will be, in practice, just as complicated.
1.2. Pro: A tax on expenditures is simple for the public to understand and reduces tax compliance costs.
1.2.1. Pro: Being taxed on purchases would encourage people to spend less, which would lead to more savings and less dependence on government handouts.
1.2.2. Pro: A simple law is more predictable and easy for the public to understand and know. While ignorance of the law is no excuse, in practice, given the complexity of the current tax code, [it actually is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek_v._United_States). A simple law sidesteps these pitfalls.
1.2.3. Pro: With [growing complexity](https://taxfoundation.org/rising-cost-complying-federal-income-tax/) of the tax code, compliance costs increased over the last century. Simplification, thus, leads to reduced costs.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Comparing the figures for 2005, around ~$350 billion would have been saved in private costs \(e.g. personal time filing taxes, hiring accountants/firms\) if there was a FairTax \([Tuerck, p. 4](http://www.beaconhill.org/FairTax2007/TaxAdminCollectionCosts071025%20.pdf)\).
1.2.3.1.1. Con: 2005 is quite a while ago.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: Tuerck seems to be one of a very small number of experts who believe in these optimistic numbers. I could find no other publications supporting these kinds of numbers.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: Other claims may not be as high \(and some are higher\), but they are clearly out there. For example, the study is supported by at least [The Taxfoundation's study](https://taxfoundation.org/rising-cost-complying-federal-income-tax/), and various other studies also return high numbers \(e.g. [Mercatus](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/Fichtner_TaxCompliance_v3.pdf)\). Also, even [politifact](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2015/may/20/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-americans-spend-500-billion-complying-tax/) notes some reports that put the figures in the $100B-$250B range.
1.2.3.2. Con: The current tax code was once much simpler. As various groups pressure the legislature to add or remove exemptions, as they did with the current tax code, it will likely grow just as complex.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: The exising tax code invites earmarks and loopholes because so many different taxes are applied. Most people have no clue how much tax they actually pay. One benefit of the FairTax is that the rate is published, it will be well known and there won’t be easy ways to write in loopholes.
1.2.4. Con: Making something easier to understand doesn't justify shifting[the large burden that would be shifted from the wealthy to the poor](https://www.kialo.com/fairtax-would-improve-the-current-us-taxation-system-2813/2813.0=2813.1-2813.4).
1.2.5. Pro: Businesses will have an easier time complying with the Fair Tax, since it would make their tax burden lighter and the amount of code relevant to them is much smaller.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Under the FairTax - Business to business transactions won't pay a tax. [The Senate Summary Reads:](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/18) There are exemptions from the tax for used and intangible property, for property or services purchased for business, export, or investment purposes, and for state government functions.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Businesses are already required to track point of sales, thus compliance with the FairTax requires no new processes, and removes all of the onerous other taxes and procedures business have in place to obey the current tax laws.[Gross Sales Required to Complete the Schedule C](https://www.irsvideos.gov/Business/SmallBusinessWeek/virtualworkshop/Lesson2)
1.2.5.3. Pro: Businesses can make decisions based on what's best for the business, not on what gives them the best tax position.
1.2.5.3.1. Con: Since there are different tax consequences for spending money in the US and spending money outside the US, this is not true in the absolute sense.
1.2.5.3.2. Con: Small businesses rarely check what the tax consequences of their behavior is before they act, so the current scheme also has no real impact on their behavior. In that respect, this would be a claim with no impact.
1.2.5.3.2.1. Con: Sellers frequently try to educate others on the tax ramifications of their behavior. For example,  Bank of America discusses some of the possible tax implications that small business owners must currently consider when they [lease or buy a particular product.](https://www.bankofamerica.com/smallbusiness/business-financing/learn/understanding-tax-implications-of-leasing/)
1.2.5.3.2.1.1. Con: The example in the above link doesn't amount to much more than a strong suggestion to talk to an accountant, advice that should be obvious to most business operators.
1.2.5.3.2.1.2. Con: Small business owners, as a group, are highly resistant to education. The amount of work it takes to start up and keep solvent a small operation prevents many of them from having the bandwidth to take this information in.
1.2.5.3.3. Con: Large businesses would be able to choose to spend their money outside the US, in effect evading US taxes, so they would still make decisions based on what gives them the better tax position. In this sense the parent claim is false.
1.2.5.3.3.1. Con: Businesses do not spend money for retail consumption. They invest their profits where and how they will give the best return.  Since they would not pay Fairtax on these expenditures, they cannot evade the tax by "spending" these profits overseas. If they distribute the profits as dividends to shareholders, then the shareholders will pay the Fairtax when they buy anything at retail.
1.2.5.4. Pro: Businesses have an easier time to predict tax expenditures and, therefore, managing their finances.
1.2.5.4.1. Pro: Small-business owners \(a critical factor to the economic mobility of minorities, immigrants and 'working poor'\) are most vulnerable to the compliance cost of the current tax code.[Tax Burden and the Propensity of Small-Bueness to File for Bankruptcy](http://www.csun.edu/~re38791/pdfs/Efrat%20Article_FINAL\[1\].pdf)
1.2.5.5. Con: Given the existence of exemptions for businesses, there would still be considerable compliance costs.
1.2.5.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.2.
1.2.6. Pro: Many good economic activities that currently require legislated exemptions to not be taxed would automatically be exempt under the FairTax.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Donations are not taxed. There is no need to fill out paperwork to be classified as a 501\(c\)3 corporation or whatever to receive tax-free donations. Churches will be on the same footing as political parties and unions.
1.2.6.1.1. Con: Making this exemption considerably erodes the Pros of having a simple system that is easy to understand and cheap to enforce. These expenses would need to be verified as such, and would require decision making on which expenses were properly exempt and which were not.
1.2.6.2. Pro: Education, being an investment, is not taxed.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: If education is considered investment, then the meaning of the term investment can be assumed to encompass anything that might have some potential for a return on investment. For example, anything that allows you to meet new people might be considered an investment, since networking is the most common way of getting a new job. This broadens the meaning of the word to an unreasonable extent, making the exemption unmanageable.
1.2.6.2.2. Con: Considering education an investment seems to assume things that are not in the bill that is proposed in the topmost claim.
1.2.6.2.3. Con: Making this exemption considerably erodes the Pros of having a simple system that is easy to understand and cheap to enforce. These expenses would need to be verified as such, and would require decision making on which expenses were properly exempt and which were not.
1.2.6.3. Pro: Savings and Investments are not taxed. Savings and investments help our country grow, and provide resilience for a rainy day. They are to be encouraged.
1.2.6.3.1. Con: Making investments exempt would require some kind of verification and enforcement system, considerably eroding the Pro claiming that the proposal is simple and cheap to administer and enforce.
1.2.7. Pro: A veteran CPA, explains how his industry would adjust: “This shift in firms’ earnings from income tax-related services to more transaction-based, consulting and audit-related services represent an opportunity for accounting professionals to add value to their clients in more meaningful and long-lasting ways that ... benefit society as a whole, as businesses get back to solving important problems, innovating, expanding, growing and developing the next generation of products and services.”[Walle](https://fairtax.org/articles/how-an-accountant-came-to-support-the-fairtax-and-the-effect-on-accounting-firms)
1.2.8. Pro: Taxpayer trust and confidence will increase because there are no loopholes allowing people or corporations to avoid paying an expenditures tax. This eliminates arguments about "illegals leaching off the system" or drug dealers and other criminals not paying, or companies weaseling out of it. If you spend money, you pay tax.
1.2.8.1. Con: People can avoid paying expenditure taxes simply by not recording transactions. If you buy something from the gas station, for example, the cashier may just not ring up the purchase, pocketing the supposed "sales tax extra" \(or sharing it with customers through prices lower than the with-tax price, but still higher than the without-tax price\)
1.2.8.1.1. Con: Under the FairTax: I buy smokes and beef jerky at your gas station for $10. Your cashier, rings up the $10 purchase, but steals the tax, $2.30. That doesn't get him very far, so he has steal the tax multiple times, over 40 times to even take $100. Now you have an accounting and an inventory problem. Either A: your revenue \($10 in your till minus your expenses\) doesn't cover the taxes you owe - or B - the state catches your inventory shortage in an audit. [Complete explaination here - 2min video](https://youtu.be/wXyyluM7pjo)
1.2.8.1.1.1. Con: In countries where people can avoid paying taxes by not recording a transaction, they do so constantly, to the tune of immense economic benefit.
1.2.8.1.1.2. Con: In countries where people can avoid paying taxes by not recording a transaction, they do so constantly, and the governments have an incredibly hard time catching such evasion by auditing them.
1.2.9. Pro: The FairTax will remove tax implications from business strategy, freeing business to do the best thing for their customers and shareholders. [Two negative impacts](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/71051/1000523-Dividends-Double-Taxation-of.PDF) due to the existing tax format:  overuse of retained earnings and incentive to finance growth with debt.
1.2.10. Con: An income tax \(even with progressive tax brackets\) is not inherently complicated.  It requires no more than a knowledge of arithmetic and percentages to understand \([middle-school-level math](http://www.corestandards.org/assets/CCSSI_Math%20Standards.pdf)\).  The complication comes from the [many loopholes](https://www.debt.org/tax/loopholes/), including credits, deductions, and tax code savings programs.  Therefore, simplifying the tax code does not require the radical step of switching from a progressive, income-based tax system to a flat, expenditure-based tax system.
1.2.10.1. Con: A CPA is professional pursuit [requiring far more proficiency](http://www.aicpa.org/BecomeACPA/CPAExam/ExaminationContent/DownloadableDocuments/cpa-exam-blueprints-effective-20170401.pdf) than math skills.
1.2.10.2. Con: Even the IRS sees value in working with professional filers - [irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/practitioner-priority-service-r)
1.2.10.3. Con: After your first audit you too may find value in hiring a CPA to manage your small business. [thebalance.com](https://www.thebalance.com/small-business-cpa-versus-accountant-397384)
1.2.10.4. Con: [2015 IRS Fact Book](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/15databk.pdf)- Page 39 \(pg 47 of 86 in PFD\) is Math Errors by Individual Filers - That's 2mil returns, \(People who took the time to fill out the form and still got it wrong.\) Another use of those math skills is adding up the fines assessed to small business owners beginning on page 44.
1.2.10.4.1. Con: Given the existence of exemptions for businesses in Fair Tax, math errors will continue to exist, as will fines, making this reform not that qualitatively different from the current tax scheme, at least in this respect.
1.2.10.4.1.1. Con: Since the FairTax will reduce tax filings by 90%, the likelihood of an audit increases for the filings that will continue, thus the filings that do occur are more likely to hire and an accounting firm to avoid mistakes.
1.2.10.4.1.1.1. Con: Since the IRS does, by far, most of the tax audits in the US, and this proposal abolishes it, the likelihood of an audit will not increase, and may well decrease.
1.2.10.4.1.1.2. Con: The job of ensuring tax compliance will be shifted to state tax agencies, which are already dramatically underfunded and unable to do their job. Many states currently piggyback on the federal government to insure tax compliance. If we're relying on state agencies at current funding levels, tax compliance would plummet.
1.2.10.4.1.2. Con: The link to the FactBook is for math mistakes made in individual filings, which will be eliminated under the FairTax.
1.2.10.5. Pro: In the digital age, computing a progressive tax rate is absolutely inconsequential compared to calculating the same taxes at a fixed rate.
1.2.11. Pro: The FairTax will remove the [lobbying power](http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/318177-lobbyings-top-50-whos-spending-big) used by large firms influence the tax code to their favor at the expense of small firms.
1.2.11.1. Pro: Take just one firm: the [nice folks](https://twitter.com/gselevator) as Goldman Sachs, who spent [$3.2MIL](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000085&year=2016)in 2016, on [27](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientissues.php?id=D000000085&year=2016) regulatory lobbying issues, [7](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientissues_spec.php?id=D000000085&year=2016&spec=TAX) of which were specific to altering the tax code for their benefit. For their efforts, [5 GS alums](https://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=79275) are employed by the White House. These transactions and hires don't provide better services to consumers, but work insulate GS from competition. The FairTax makes a quarter of these transactions irrelevant because corporate and income taxes won't exist.
1.2.12. Pro: A sales tax is less coercive than an income tax, as it is easier to control spending than to control income.
1.2.12.1. Con: Fiscal discipline is a separate matter from the source of tax revenue.
1.2.13. Pro: The necessities of life are not taxed. The Federal Government, through its calculation of the Poverty Level, determines the total dollar value of all necessities, and issues a monthly rebate to every legal resident.
1.2.13.1. Pro: This eliminates the ability of businesses to lobby the government to get their product added to the list of necessities.
1.2.13.2. Pro: In the current system, milk is on the list of necessities, even though many people are lactose intolerant.
1.2.13.3. Pro: The citizens decide for themselves which items are necessities for their family, and how to spend their monthly rebate check.
1.2.13.3.1. Pro: This has a lot in common with the very popular [Universal Basic Income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income).
1.2.13.4. Con: Since this is the only element of the Fair Tax that is makes the tax system progressive, and progressive taxation is a hot issue for both conservatives and liberals, it's quite possible that it might become highly politicized.
1.2.14. Pro: Individuals do not need to file tax returns under a FairTax system \([Tuerck, p. 3](http://www.beaconhill.org/FairTax2007/TaxAdminCollectionCosts071025%20.pdf)\). This simplifies the lifes of citizens.
1.2.14.1. Pro: Compliance is a huge time- and money-sucker under the current system; Fair Tax would reduce this to nearly nil.
1.2.14.2. Pro: No surprise amount of taxes due in April each year. When the tax is spread out evenly throughout the year, it's easier to budget for and does not cause hardship month.
1.2.14.3. Con: As people become accustomed to the tax - and especially if stores start putting the "tax included" price on goods, as is done on gasoline in the US and in retail stores in many parts of the world - people's awareness of paying tax will diminish. It is important to society for people to be aware of how much they contribute to the public coffers.
1.2.14.4. Con: The government could easily prepare tax returns for many individuals under the current system, only requiring individuals to make corrections to the government's estimate.  [A system to do this has been proposed and successfully pilot tested](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/03/22/521132960/episode-760-tax-hero). It would likely already have been implemented if not for lobbying by entrenched interests, including tax preparers.
1.3. Con: By deciding what and whether to purchase, people can decide whether to pay the sales tax. An income tax, on the other hand, is almost unavoidable. This leads to higher tax revenue under income tax while also preventing economic recession under high market burden of high consumption tax.
1.3.1. Con: This sales tax allows individuals to avoid being taxed, leading to an unequal representation of what tax revenue can be expected each fiscal year.
1.4. Pro: The FairTax will improve the health of the US economy in a variety of ways, such as by encouraging saving and investment.
1.4.1. Pro: Capital gains taxes would be eliminated and and therefore investment would be stimulated.
1.4.1.1. Con: In recent history, capital gains is more and more due to trade and appreciation of non-productive securities. Churning stocks does not grow production. Whereas increasing the consumer's cost of produced materials would tend to impede demand and therefore production. This would slow economies on the whole.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Capital gains taxes incentivizes assets to be held to avoid paying the tax instead of selling the asset and allocating to assets which may be more suitable for the investor.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: In the wealth accumulation phase, investments with more risk may be more appropriate when seeking the potential for higher gains. Later, in the distribution phase, these same investments with high risk would likely be inappropriate. However selling the investments to reallocate to a more appropriate asset class will incur gains taxes. The FairTax removes this perverse investment incentive.
1.4.1.3. Con: [Historically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States), the taxation rate of capital gains has little correlation with investment rates.
1.4.2. Con: Taxing purchases encourages individuals to spend less, which slows the economy.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Even taking into account the net rise in disposable income, the general consumption effect would be negative because people with the highest propensity to consumer would be taxed higher, while those with the lowest consumption rate relative to their income would be taxed lower.
1.4.3. Con: The transition would be difficult, for consumers, for businesses, and for governments at all levels to administer.
1.4.3.1. Con: The difficulty of a policy change cannot deter people from implementing a good policy, as long as it is remotely feasible. If it were otherwise, the US wouldn't have declared war on Germany, and it wouldn't have put a man on the moon.
1.4.3.2. Con: The concept of a sales tax should not be difficult in any way for consumers to grasp. Neither should the execution be.
1.4.3.3. Con: The transition to not needing to hire a tax expert yearly \(or more frequently\) should actually quickly alleviate significant burden from many consumers.
1.4.3.4. Pro: The FairTax plan aims to [eliminate the Internal Revenue Service](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-fair-tax-plan-pros-cons-effect-3305765). Suddenly gutting such a large and entrenched institution is dangerous because it will cause confusion and unforeseen consequences.
1.4.3.5. Con: Businesses already manage the burden of imposing state and local level sales taxes. An additional Federal sales tax seems a minimally or even trivially burdensome addition.
1.4.3.6. Pro: Eliminating the IRS will also significantly increase unemployment. Not to mention the sudden loss revenue of tax preparation corporations \([$9 billion in 2012](https://www.franchisehelp.com/industry-reports/tax-preparation-industry-analysis-2018-cost-trends/)\) and massive layoffs, dramatically increasing complexity and costs to the government.
1.4.4. Pro: Not taxing the purchase of used products encourages their purchase, which conserves raw materials and landfill space.
1.4.4.1. Con: The secondary market - thrift shops, used cars, used parts stores, salvage shops - is a LIFELINE for low income families. Driving higher income people to these markets will increase demand \(and thus price\) and create scarcity. This will force low income people to pay a higher price or full & taxed price on basic items.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Currently, most used goods are thrown away. Increasing the value of used goods would increase the market size, offsetting the scarcity mentioned by the parent claim.
1.4.4.2. Pro: A thriving used goods market would have a great positive environmental impact.
1.4.5. Pro: "Businesses don't just absorb increased costs. Higher taxes are treated no differently than other forms of increased costs" prices increase, and the poor have decreased purchasing power.[Higher Taxes for "The Rich" Ultimately Hurt The Poor](https://www.thoughtco.com/how-higher-taxes-for-the-rich-ultimately-hurt-the-poor-3303539)
1.4.5.1. Con: There's [little proof](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/30/452905475/fact-check-do-tax-cuts-grow-the-economy) of anything close to a direct relationship between lower taxes and economic growth. Lower taxes hurt the poor just as often high ones, especially when [the taxes become more regressive](https://www.kialo.com/fairtax-would-improve-the-current-us-taxation-system-2813/2813.0=2813.1-2813.4).
1.4.5.1.1. Con: The wikipedia entry notes "This article is about the political term." Of the 6 [historical examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics#History_and_usage_of_the_term) of the term used, all are for political attacks, not economic research.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Any textbook on pricing theory will acknowledge one factor to determine price is government regulations.[Principles of Marketing](https://open.lib.umn.edu/principlesmarketing/chapter/15-2-factors-that-affect-pricing-decisions/)  "Pricing decisions are affected by federal and state regulations."
1.4.6. Con: The rate at which expenditures would have to be taxed would have to be dramatically higher than 23% to cover the current US Government's budget. This will have a lot of ramifications, including slowing down the economy.
1.4.6.1. Con: This Wikipedia entry is, perhaps, easier to read, but comes to the same conclusion: the Fairtax will generate about the same revenue as the current system if the rate is 23%:[Tax Rate for Revenue Neutrality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_neutrality_of_the_FairTax#Tax_rate_for_revenue_neutrality)
1.4.6.1.1. Con: The source supporting that tax rate has a well-published bias aiming at shrinking government and lowering tax rates. It would not be implausible for them to be overly optimistic in their conclusions.
1.4.6.2. Pro: If the set tax rate proves to be insufficient or too high, it is extremely easy to change the rate, universally and fairly.
1.4.6.2.1. Con: Recent history testifies to the fact that changing a tax rate is fraught with political difficulties, and not easy at all.
1.4.6.2.1.1. Con: Marginal tax rates have been modified several times during the period of modern political polarization.
1.4.6.3. Con: The need to impose a high sales tax does not, on its own, invalidate the Fair Tax, because it could be seen as a positive if one believes that 'improving the US tax system' means limiting the resources of government, thus encouraging cuts in spending.
1.4.6.3.1. Con: Trying to force cuts in government spending by reforming the tax code is a deceptive way to achieve a more limited government. Such a proposal should stand on its own.
1.4.6.3.2. Con: Trying to force cuts in government spending by reforming the tax code to a more regressive alternative puts a large part of the cost of that change on the middle and poor classes during the period of transition, which could be long.
1.4.6.3.3. Con: Trying to force cuts in government spending by reforming the tax code is unlikely to succeed because Congress has difficulty limiting their spending and has the power to borrow unlimited amounts of money, in practice.
1.4.6.3.4. Pro: The Fair Tax itself proposes cutting a large portion of the executive by eliminating the IRS, thereby making it unnecessary to pay for that portion of government.
1.4.6.4. Pro: Such a high purchase tax rate can hurt sales badly, possibly causing the economy to spiral into depression.
1.4.6.5. Con: Concerns about the rate is not a rebuttal to the FairTax. If government spending requires 90% of Gross Domestic Product to operate \(regardless of tax format\), that's an issue with government size, not the collection method. The FairTax provides the transparency needed to have a real conversation about government spending.
1.4.6.6. Con: The TaxFoundation offers a comparison between the current tax system and the FairTax: the [Tax Freedom Day](https://taxfoundation.org/publications/tax-freedom-day/), which was April 23 in 2017.  The average American works 113 days \(or 31% of the year\) to pay federal, state and local government obligations before they are free to work for themselves for the remainder of the year. If we include federal borrowing, the day reaches out to May 7. A 23% rate for the federal budget is in line with the existing system. Explanation of [methodology 2008](https://files.taxfoundation.org/legacy/docs/wp3-20080326.pdf) and [2014](https://taxfoundation.org/tax-freedom-day-2014-april-21-three-days-later-last-year/)
1.4.6.7. Pro: If the FairTax leads to higher deficits and difficulties in outfitting the armed forces, taxes or consumption will have to increase. Raising the tax will *reduce* consumption, while lowering taxes will not necessarily increase consumption, creating a 'bust' cycle and bankrupting the nation.
1.4.6.8. Pro: A [credible and balanced source](https://www.brookings.edu/research/dont-buy-the-sales-tax/) puts the rate necessary for the government to be solvent at closer to 34%. However, a rate of 34% wouldn't make the reform out of the question, at least not when compared to 23%.
1.4.6.8.1. Con: 1998 Seems a bit dated for your source.
1.4.6.9. Pro: The federal sales tax rate would actually have to be "[between 45 and 53%](http://www.ctj.org/pdf/perryflattaxfairtax.pdf)" to raise an amount of revenue similar to that of the current system.  [ITEP paper cited by initial CTJ link](https://itep.org/wp-content/uploads/sale0904.pdf)
1.4.6.10. Con: Personal consumption expenditures stand at [$13.383T/yr](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCE). A 23% tax on such expenditures, as proposed by FairTax, would yield revenue of $3.08T. The 2017 federal budget has estimated expenditures of [$4.20T](https://faq.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2017/09-September/0917-government-receipts-and-expenditures.pdf) against $3.57T of revenue, leading to a deficit of $632.5B. To yield an equivalent tax revenue, the FairTax rate would need to be 26.7%. This is not dramatically higher than 23%, especially in the context of budgetary policy.
1.4.6.10.1. Con: That figure is too complicated to be estimated by simple arithmetic, and we should rely on experts' analyses to judge it.
1.4.6.10.2. Con: The estimate assumes that personal consumption expenditures would stay the same, despite the fact that prices could increase by more than 10%.
1.4.6.10.2.1. Con: When business to business taxes and employer FICA, and offer embedded compliance costs will removed so that the price of goods and service will decrease.
1.4.6.10.3. Con: "Personal consumption expenditures" includes purchases that would not be taxed, such as used goods and foreign transactions. From [the BEA](https://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/NIPAhandbookch5.pdf):
"PCE includes purchases of new goods and of services by households from government and government enterprises, the costs incurred by NPISHs in providing services on behalf of households, net purchases of used goods by households, and purchases abroad of goods and services by U.S. residents traveling, working, or attending school in foreign countries...."
1.4.6.10.4. Pro: The link below, on page 8, defines Personal Consumption Expenditures as follows:  "Personal consumption expenditures \(PCE\) \(1–15\) measures goods and services purchased by U.S. residents. PCE consists mainly of purchases of new goods and of services by individuals from private business."  [bea.gov](https://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/nipaguid.pdf)
1.4.6.11. Con: The pdf file at this link goes into gory detail about the Fairtax rate calculation. For the year 2005, it concluded that the rate should be 23.8%. As per HR25, the rate is recalculated every year. [fairtax-structure-psyclone.netdna-ssl.com](https://fairtax-structure-psyclone.netdna-ssl.com/client_assets/fairtaxorg/media/attachments/56c4/af23/6970/2d7c/197c/0000/56c4af2369702d7c197c0000.pdf?1455730467)
1.4.7. Pro: Goods and services purchased today already have taxes embedded in the price. The FairTax would replace hidden taxes \(embeded\) with a one-time, transparent tax.[What Are Embedded Taxes](http://www.ohfairtax.org/pdf/FT08.pdf)
1.4.8. Pro: The FairTax would remove double taxation of investments by removing: Capital Gains, Corporate Income, Personal Income, and Death Tax, all of which could be applied to a [single investment](https://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/explaining-the-perverse-impact-of-double-taxation-with-a-chart/).
1.4.9. Pro: The FairTax will provide an environment for US net exports to increase.
1.4.9.1. Pro: "Sitting side by side, the hidden hand of Uncle Sam raises the price of American goods worldwide, while goods imported into our country bear no such burden from their governments."[waysandmeans.house.gov](http://waysandmeans.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Americans_For_Fair_Taxation_18.pdf)
1.4.9.1.1. Pro: When the embedded costs of the existing IRS tax code are removed, the most onerous barriers limiting US companies will be removed - or as the I Pencil essay stays "Leave all creative energies uninhibited." [I Pencil movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYO3tOqDISE)
1.4.9.2. Pro: Despite an skilled workforce and developed infrastructure, the US operates with an annual trade deficit, with the 2016 deficit increasing to $502.3 billion. [bea.gov](https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/international/trade/2017/trad1216.htm)
1.4.9.2.1. Pro: Our existing tariffs and quotas are self-inflicted trade barriers limiting US exports. [Boundless Economics](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-economics/chapter/barriers-to-trade/)
1.4.9.2.1.1. Pro: While quotas have been proven to be unhelpful, these protectionist measures continue to be the [default solution](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-whirlpool/panel-finds-u-s-washing-machine-makers-hurt-by-lg-samsung-imports-idUSKBN1CA1W4) for policy makers to remedy the US trade deficit. Another approach would be to compare the tax rates South Korea applies to Samsung \(20%\) verse the whopping 39.5% corporate rate applied to American manufacturers.
1.4.10. Pro: Removing barriers and disincentives to save will address the long term problems of income inequality. “By more efficiently and equitably promoting saving and asset building, more people will have the tools to protect their families in tough times and invest in themselves and their children.”[urban.org](http://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/)
1.4.10.1. Pro: Many current benefits DO discourage savings, i.e. need-based college grants.  I \(foolishly\) personally spent an investment to get more of a grant when I was 18.  If I hadn't, I may have been able to retire by now.
1.4.10.2. Con: The poor have little to save, so this really only incentivizes the rich to save.
1.4.10.3. Con: FairTax has no mechanism, to my knowledge, to remove "barriers to savings." It removes the taxation of savings, which is not a barrier to savings [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4358152/).
1.4.11. Con: A fair tax would, if it were high enough to cover the government's expenses, erode an enormous amount of lower- and middle class people's disposable income, which will lead to fewer consumption and in turn hurt the economy. The people that pay fewer taxes in a fair tax system are wealthy, and would save most of the money they gain, thereby not stimulating consumption at all. A fair tax can only work if trickle down economics works, which it does not.
1.4.12. Con: Taxing purchases of new goods and services disincentivizes their purchase.
1.4.12.1. Pro: FairTax would encourage individuals to save money rather than spending it, decreasing the number of transactions and slowing the economy via hoarding.
1.4.12.1.1. Con: Saved money creates long term economic growth. Money in savings is not stagnant, it is used to generate a return by the institution holding the saved funds. Naturally, the institution is seeking the highest risk adjusted rate of return. This is how capital is drawn to its area of greatest use.
1.4.12.1.2. Con: Hording is all but a thing of the past. Very few people hold significant quantities of money in cash. Savings are likely in checking, savings, cds, money markets, or short term securities. Furthermore, much of this money not consumed may be put directly in stocks, bonds or other assets as investments...
1.4.12.2. Pro: The FairTax would drive retail activity [underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairTax#Underground_economy).
1.4.12.2.1. Pro: European value added tax gap provides a template for what to expect from consumption tax fraud.  There as much as 12% of tax revenue is lost.  [VAT gap](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/tax-cooperation-control/vat-gap_en)
1.4.12.2.2. Con: The vast majority of retail transactions are with sellers that are too large to go underground. The volume of retail activity that does not involve the purchase of raw materials is very small. Babysitting perhaps. Babysitters could probably get away with not adding the Fairtax to their charges, because they would probably not come to the attention of the state tax collection authorities.   Retailers are known to state tax authorities, and have state-issued tax IDs. The state will audit them.
1.4.12.2.2.1. Con: Although decreasing, the black market is [estimated](http://freakonomics.com/2012/06/25/how-big-is-the-world-black-market/) to be over 22% of the world GDP.
1.4.12.2.3. Con: The vast majority of retailers purchase items wholesale, or purchase raw materials used in their products. If these retailers do not collect Fairtax from their customers, then they must pay the Fairtax to their suppliers. When I buy something from a wholesaler, they ask me for my state tax ID number. Since I don't have one, they charge me the state sales tax.
1.4.12.2.4. Con: Even if some businesses manage to stay underground \(e.g.  street-level illegal drug dealers\) that just means that they have more profit to spend. When a drug dealer uses his profits to buy a big screen TV, Walmart collects the Fairtax from him just like the Maserati dealer collects Fairtax from his wholesaler.
1.4.12.2.5. Con: To quote from the Wikipedia Fairtax link above "85.7% of all retail sales are made by 92,334 businesses, which is 3.6% of American companies. In the service sector, approximately 80% of sales are made by 1.2% of U.S. businesses." This vastly reduces the number of entities that need to be audited, compared to the current system. And the 45 states which already have sales tax already have an experienced auditing force.
1.4.12.3. Pro: People would barter to avoid paying the tax.
1.4.12.3.1. Con: People already barter to avoid paying taxes. There's no reason to believe that they would be particularly more inclined to do so under a Fair Tax system.
1.4.12.3.1.1. Con: Some people barter to avoid an 8% \(varies with location\) sales tax; this would increase dramatically if the tax at point of sale increased to 25% or higher.
1.4.12.3.2. Con: The Fair Tax book addresses this. True, there will be cases where your plumber will agree to get paid under the table, but for the vast vast majority of transactions \(those that take place in grocery, department and mega-stores like Wal-Mart\) would still happen and be taxed \(somewhere in the realm of 90% of all taxable sales\). Also, the amount of tax-dodging would be minuscule compared to today's system.
1.4.12.4. Pro: Taxing goods lowers [economic utility](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Principles_of_Economics/Utility) for consumers and producers. Taxing income, specifically among the wealthy, has minimal impact on economic utility.
1.4.12.5. Con: -> See 1.4.7.
1.4.12.6. Con: Consumptions would be reduced if  the FairTax were only adding a sales tax to all the other existing forms of tax. However the FairTax proposal is to repeal the 16th amendment and remove all other forms of tax. Therefore consumers will have 100% of their own paycheck to allocate however they want.
1.4.12.7. Con: Holding this logic: Taxing income and investments disincentives earning income and saving. Which economy has a longer lifecycle, the one that creates barriers to work and investments or one that creates barriers to overconsumption?
1.4.12.8. Pro: The Fair Tax would avoidable by people buying goods outside of the country.
1.4.13. Con: It is hard to imagine that a fair tax would increase, at the same time, consumption AND savings. This argument relies on the assumption that a fair tax increases GDP \(in which case all four factors automatically go up\). First one has to prove that GDP will increase due to such a tax system before one can make the original claim. This is unlikely.
1.4.14. Con: The FairTax is just an excuse to lower taxes for the rich and for businesses, in the hopes that that might boost the economy. Sadly, there's no proof that lower taxes help the economy. On the contrary, if there is any correlation, it's that [a higher effective corporate tax rate leads to lower unemployment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rnbZdNCyXYA-NFcO-9cZIJehGnj93EbKBOg7v-2JLxM/edit?usp=sharing).
1.4.15. Con: The FairTax would would create massive tax evasion and deadweight loss and eventually be replaced with a VAT. A VAT would turn the U.S. into a slow-growth European-style economy. General consumption taxes are economically undesirable because they do not tax imputed income derived from land rents and patents, they reduce allocative efficiency, and because they hinder development by taxing the formal sectors of the economy at a higher rate than the informal sectors.
1.4.16. Pro: Because the sale of an item can only be taxed once, the fair tax would increase recycling and second hand resale. This would be good for the environment.
1.5. Con: -> See 1.4.6.
1.6. Pro: The FairTax is simple and cheap for the government to administer.
1.6.1. Pro: Sales taxation reduces corporate tax evasion by making sure multinational corporation can't hide their profits in inter subsidiary fees
1.6.1.1. Con: Sales taxation rewards spending outside the jurisdiction, a thing corporations are already inclined to do.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Companies are unable to "declare" \(or shift\) their profits in other countries for a tax advantage. The tax is levied wherever in the US the product is sold.
1.6.2. Con: Shifting the collection burden to states would increase the workload of state sales-tax agencies in states that are mostly operating unbalanced budgets.
1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.4.3.
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.6.5. Pro: The IRS acknowledges they have a serious tax evasion problem. By their own estimates evasion costs "the federal government on average $[458 billion per year](http://fortune.com/2016/04/29/tax-evasion-cost/) between 2008 through 2010."
1.6.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.
1.6.5.2. Con: The main cause of this problem is complexity of tax code and enforcement budget cuts. Since the legislature is the cause of both those issues, and remains in charge, why wouldn't they keep causing these problems?
1.6.6. Pro: Under the power of the executive branch, the IRS, changes the tax code and enforces penalties without due process. Removing the IRS will return some balance of power to the legislative branch as the constitution is written.
1.6.6.1. Con: Returning rulemaking duties to Congress is a bad thing because Congress appears to be incapable of making rules. Agencies, on the other hand, are much better at making clear, reasonable, and relatively coherent rules because of their more stringent [rulemaking process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rulemaking).
1.6.6.1.1. Con: That's a feature, not a bug. Rules changes should be hard to make. It's too easy for a President, via a change of personnel or preference, to dramatically influence policy \(or undo previous policy\).

That means that long-term planning for individuals and organizations becomes difficult if not impossible, as they cannot rely upon consistent/coherent behavior over a long period of time.
1.6.6.2. Con: Congress has the power to do whatever it wants to do with agencies. Agencies only exist and are empowered and limited by their enabling statute, which is passed and can be amended by Congress.

Since this proposal is for Congress to do a thing, the parent claim that doing that thing returns power to Congress makes no sense, because Congress already has all that power.
1.6.6.2.1. Pro: Congress never lost its power, it delegated it to the IRS, thus removing the IRS does not return any power, it simply reorganises or re-delegates it.
1.6.7. Pro: Due to the simplicity of the FairTax, elected officials will be less willing to use the tax code to fund pet projects. Today \(10/3/17\) there are 3,303 tax code proposals to the current congress \(115th\). [govtrack.us](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?text=tax+code#sort=relevance)
1.6.7.1. Con: It would simplify the tax code, and be LESS regressive, if there were simply a law preventing the use of tax code for political purposes. A progressive tax bracket, with ALL sources of income being considered equal, and with NO exemptions would be infinitely easier for tax-payers to calculate and for the IRS to administer. Using tax code to reward certain constituents, or to encourage \(or discourage\) certain types of behavior is a problem that the Fair Tax proposal does not fully address.
1.6.8. Con: A Direct Subtraction VAT tax has built in fraud stopping features. Such features are particularly necessary since the size of this tax would be so great and the collection is focused at a single point of sale instead of through the supply chain.
1.6.9. Pro: There is no need for the government to get involved in "[means testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_test)" to determine eligibility for welfare.  The Social Security Administration already has procedures to assign Social Security Numbers to people, and everybody who has one will receive the Prebate.
1.6.10. Con: Administration costs may not be simple and cheap due to the incentive to avoid losing 23% on ones consumption costs.  Exemptions open the door for complication.
1.6.11. Con: -> See 1.4.15.
1.6.12. Pro: The tax is collected one time: when the item is sold new at retail. Used items are not taxed.
1.6.12.1. Pro: Experiencing the tax rate in every purchase constantly reminds taxpayers of the government's main revenue, making it highly visible.
1.6.12.2. Pro: Under existing tax law, the IRS must monitor \(or have the ability to audit\) every business transaction, every wage paid, each investment transaction along with a host of other items to ensure each event was properly reported.
1.6.12.3. Con: If we take the sales tax system in the USA as an example of how 'simple' a fair tax would be, I find it hard to find any increase in efficiency. With literally thousands of tax districts sometimes not more than a few blocks apart, the US has even managed to make their \(in theory\) simple sales tax system more complicated that the VAT in European countries. The same is likely to happen to the fair tax.
1.6.12.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.
1.6.13. Con: Both forms of taxation \(income and consumption\) require enforcement in order to prevent tax evasion
1.6.13.1. Pro: A consumption tax would leave government revenue vulnerable to the emergence of a black market, therefore, a switch to a consumption tax would not necessarily reduce the need for the government to take enforcement measures.
1.6.14. Pro: A tax on expenditures necessarily applies to undocumented workers, resolving one of the aspects of the immigration issue.
1.6.15. Con: The fair tax system means the state would force every person to become a tax collector.
1.6.16. Pro: One of the single greatest benefits of the Fair Tax is that it would require that taxes be applied to the population as a whole, which would make it incredibly hard to justify tax increases, as opposed to the current system which segregates out sections of the population to tax at higher rates. In other words, "I'm raising taxes on you all" is a harder pill to swallow than, "I'm raising taxes, but I promise it won't be yours".
1.6.16.1. Con: This is a flaw, not a feature, since many people gain far more out of the economy, even proportionally, than others, so it makes sense to increase their tax rate. This is why the Fair Tax is [regressive](https://www.kialo.com/fairtax-would-improve-the-current-us-taxation-system-2813/2813.0=2813.1-2813.4), relative to the current tax system.
1.6.16.2. Con: The issue would simply be moved to what kinds of purchases are exempt, as the FairTax allows plenty of exemptions.
1.6.17. Con: The government looses the ability to provide incentives for certain activities. It could not help people to become self-employed by lowering self-employed taxes compared to tax on employment.
1.6.17.1. Con: Tax incentives often do not achieve their aims, and have deleterious side effects, as noted by this [mildly liberal, but mostly bipartisan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_on_Taxation_and_Economic_Policy#Political_stance) think tank [piece](https://itep.org/tax-incentives-costly-for-states-drag-on-the-nation/).
1.6.17.2. Con: Those who believe in a minimal government oppose the implementation of policies that try to shape society, including tax incentives.
1.6.17.3. Con: This is a feature, not a bug. The government can still provide incentives for certain activities, but the tax code is not the place to do social programs.  E.G. the government can create a law to send me a check if I send them a receipt for a solar panel. It doesn't need to imbed this into the tax code. Then this law could get the open debate and publicity that it deserves. This is similar to the recent Cash For Clunkers program.
1.6.17.3.1. Con: Exempting some purchases increases the [cost of administering the tax system](https://www.kialo.com/fairtax-would-improve-the-current-us-taxation-system-2813/2813.0=2813.1+2813.3), and decreases [the public's ability to easily deal with it](https://www.kialo.com/fairtax-would-improve-the-current-us-taxation-system-2813/2813.0=2813.1+2813.2). This considerably erodes two of the main reasons for adopting the FairTax.
1.6.17.4. Con: The manipulation of incentives is what made the original, fairly simple and direct, income tax into the nightmare of complexity that we currently "enjoy." Yes, Fair Tax WOULD remove the ability of the government to incentivize certain activities. That's part of its appeal.
1.6.18. Pro: A FairTax abolishes the Internal Revenue Service and shifts the responsibility to state sales tax agencies \([Tuerck, p. 3](http://www.beaconhill.org/FairTax2007/TaxAdminCollectionCosts071025%20.pdf)\). This abolishes one agency level.
1.6.18.1. Con: People who are employed because of the current tax structure would lose their jobs. The IRS employs approximately 100,000 people and an additional 70,000 people in the US work for small tax prep companies. Some \(unknown\) percentage of the approximately 700,000 corporate CPAs would also no longer be needed.
1.6.18.1.1. Con: Keeping structures in place for the sake of keeping people employed is a waste of funding, and, in government, a clear expression of [nepotism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepotism). It would be MUCH better to invest the money that would be spent on this to train them to do something actually useful.
1.6.18.1.1.1. Con: Any reform would need to be gradual so as to account for these changes. It would be disastrous for tens of thousands of people to suddenly lose their job, for/in/on which they have likely studied, trained, invested, and depend.
\(Otherwise, if their positions are wasteful, under most economic scenarios your argument would be valid: this should not be expanded, and instead should be gradually contracted\)
1.6.18.1.1.1.1. Con: Mental Floss takes a look at jobs that no longer exist, or are performed by automation. [mentalfloss.com](http://mentalfloss.com/article/58945/35-jobs-no-longer-exist)
1.6.18.1.1.1.2. Con: Keep in mind, a skill is something you do - show up on time, read the question before responding, speaking politely to coworkers. These are employable skills. In most jobs, information is a very small, constantly changing facet of the daily work. No doubt, compassion is needed in making the transition; but most jobs pay workers for work preformed in the past, very few workers have guaranteed employment from week to week or month to month.
1.6.18.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.7.
1.6.18.2. Con: -> See 1.6.2.
1.6.18.3. Con: Since there are still plenty of exemptions granted to businesses, there will still be a need for a federal agency administering these exemptions.
1.6.18.4. Pro: States already have have existing Revenue Departments to receive taxes from businesses and \(currently\) individual filers. No additional state or federal processes are required to implement the FairTax.
1.6.18.4.1. Con: Most states are famous for having terrible tax enforcement \(mostly due to defunding\). Much, much worse than that of the federal government. So bad that attorneys often negotiate very late payment of taxes at no penalty whatsoever, because the state is glad to have the payment at all.
1.6.18.4.1.1. Con: So we agree, the existing tax structure could be repealed and replaced with a FairTax which would limit the revenue streams states need to monitor to ensure tax evasion is minimized, caught and prosecuted.
1.6.18.4.2. Pro: States already rely on the ability to collect revenue and enforce the existing tax code.[“accounting for 27 percent of state tax collections.”](https://taxfoundation.org/state-individual-income-tax-rates-and-brackets-2016/#_ftn1)
1.6.18.4.3. Con: Parent claims that the states can just handle an additional 5 trillion odd dollars of revenue and pass it to the federal government without any extra work. This is patently false.
1.6.18.5. Pro: States already have existing Secretary of States which records all new business filings and measures in place to provide business licenses for tax exemption transactions between businesses proposed by the FairTax.
1.6.18.5.1. Pro: Using only a sales tax, Texas manages to [collect and grow it's tax base](https://bivisual.cpa.texas.gov/QvAJAXZfc/OpenDocNoToolbar.htm?document=Documents%2FTR_Master_UI.qvw&host=QVS%40daupswap80&anonymous=true&select=LB00,03&sheet=SH28). If Texas were a stand-alone country, it would be the [10th largest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_between_U.S._states_and_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)) national economy in the world. [imf.org](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/01/weodata/index.aspx)
1.6.18.5.2. Pro: The smallest state by GDP, Vermont, already applies a [6% sales tax](http://tax.vermont.gov/business-and-corp/sales-and-use-tax/getting-started)\(in addition to collecting a dirty income tax\). The sales tax allows for many [exemptions](http://tax.vermont.gov/business-and-corp/nonprofit-and-exempt-organizations/exemption-certificates#exemptions), even more lenient than proposed by the FairTax.
1.6.19. Con: In contrast to income tax a FairTax would not be withheld automatically which opens the door for tax evasion.
1.6.19.1. Con: The current income tax does not require automatic withholdings. [Current law allows the tax payer to make quarterly payments instead](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/employees/tax-withholding). With the Fairtax, the tax would be automatically added at the cash register. The tax payer will pay the tax at the time of purchase.
1.6.19.2. Con: The Fairtax makes tax evasion more difficult.   It would require that the seller agrees not to collect the tax from the buyer. The buyer would gain from this , but what incentive does the seller have to participate in this crime?
1.7. Pro: Taxing is immoral, and there will be less of it under the FairTax.
1.7.1. Con: Those with less money consume a greater percentage of their money, with the poor spending over 100% of their income. The paltry prebate that FairTax contemplates actually only means that the poor pay more in taxes than they do currently, both as a percentage and as the actual amount.
1.7.1.1. Con: the poor will not pay more taxes unless they buy a brand new 62 inch TV, a brand new gaming system or a brand new car. No taxes will be collected on items purchased from the huge second hand market. This empowering the poor to control their tax burden.
1.7.2. Con: There is no functional moral difference between an income tax and a consumption tax. For all the 'immorality' of taxing someone's income, making someone's necessary consumption more expensive has the same moral culpability. They are simply different sides of the same coin.
1.7.2.1. Con: Fortunately, the FairTax is not just any run of the mill expenditure tax - The FairTax [stipulates](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/25) "lawful U.S. residents receive a monthly sales tax rebate \(Family Consumption Allowance\)"  to bring every family up to the poverty level before the first dollar is spent. Because the rebate is received in advance, the FairTax calls this a [prebate](http://www.flfairtax.org/Documents/Whitepapers/PrebateExplaination-revised-May-2014.pdf).
1.7.2.1.1. Con: The poverty threshold/line is too arbitrary a measurement - this proposed prebate may not be enough to positively impact the economic inequality that we currently have, in some cases. The poverty line could be understating actual poverty levels. For example, [the census data for 2016](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html) does not have list any cost-of-living adjustments - just a flat threshold based on age, partner, and number of dependent children.
1.7.2.1.2. Con: The current system, on average, leaves more money in the pockets of the poor because it is much less [regressive than the FairTax](https://www.kialo.com/fairtax-would-improve-the-current-us-taxation-system-2813/2813.0=2813.1-2813.4).
1.7.2.1.3. Con: Administrating the "prebate" is another layer of complexity that works directly against the top level argument that FairTax is easy & simple.
1.7.2.1.4. Con: A “prebate” would only reduce regressiveness between the poor vs lower middle class. It will not significantly alter the math on the % net tax paid by middle class vs the ultra rich.
1.7.3. Con: There seems to be a hope that the FairTax will lead to less taxation. If the goal is legitimate and politically supported, this goal should be implemented by simply lowering income taxes instead of reforming the tax system to [one that disproportionately affects the poor](https://www.kialo.com/fairtax-would-improve-the-current-us-taxation-system-2813/2813.0=2813.1-2813.4).
1.7.3.1. Con: It's not about less taxation as it does not address spending. It is about the freedom for individuals to control their tax burden. It is about abolishing an unwieldy system that only benefits those who can afford to pay $800.00 for a tax attorney to get it right.
1.7.4. Con: A bad tax system may be better in the long run if the suffering inflicted by the current tax system motivates taxpayers to hold politicians accountable.  The FairTax may make the system less painful but does nothing to address the lack of accountability.
1.7.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.8.
1.7.5. Con: A FairTax wouldn't work to counter act the concentration of wealth \(and thus power\) naturally caused by allowing money to multiply itself through equity financing.  The concentration of wealth and power naturally leads to greater tyranny.
1.7.6. Pro: Wage should be determined by a worker and their employer. Income taxes disrupt this by forcing employers to pay their employees less and diverting the difference to the government. The FairTax fixes this.
1.7.7. Pro: Taxing consumption is fairer, as those with more money consume more.
1.7.7.1. Con: Taxing consumption is unfair, because those with more money consume less as a fraction of wealth, and because consumption taxes double tax renters. The value which government expenditures provides is capitalized in land values. Land with good access to public services and infrastructure commands a higher rental price. Renters pay for these services twice: once to government via the consumption tax, and once to land owners via higher rent payments for land with best access to public services.
1.7.7.2. Con: Those with more money also accumulate more, thus the only fair tax system is a redistributive one
1.7.8. Pro: Under the Fair Tax, the everyone receives a prebate for their taxed consumption. This is like a Universal Basic Income, which is much fairer than a heterogeneous series of programs that try to help the poor in ways that politicians of the moment deem best.
1.7.9. Pro: Expenses above the monthly prebate are discretionary. Avoid excessive taxation under the FairTax by limiting discretionary expenses. Or enjoy your Diner's Card to the upmost limits and pay your neighborhood's fair share of taxes.
1.7.10. Pro: A change from from the current income tax code is necessary because the income tax continues to produce terrible inequality. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/opinion/leonhardt-income-inequality.html?_r=0)
1.7.11. Con: There is nothing immoral about taxation when the government provides services for the common good. There is an ongoing discussion on [when taxation is theft, and when it may be moral](https://www.kialo.com/taxation-is-theft-5380/5380.0=5380.1/=5380.1).
1.7.11.1. Con: "Common good" is rarely common, and hardly ever good. Common means everyone participates in it. And if the good we're talking about is a material thing that possesses the quality of scarcity, meaning one unit of it can only be used by one person at a time, the more people use it, the less common it is. And often what is called good is often not agreed upon by all as a universal good. In most cases, its merely something one group with power wants everyone to subsidize.
1.7.11.2. Con: Taxation is Theft.   It does not matter if the mob says it is OK.  Why should the mob choose what is best for the "common good" and then be able to force even those that disagree with their interpretation to still pony up their property.   

If a gang had a vote which you could participate in, to steal your car but they will give you a bicycle and a poor person a bicycle, would that still be theft?
1.7.12. Con: Taxation is theft no matter whether taken from income or expenditure, therefore both the "fair tax" and the income tax are immoral.
1.7.13. Pro: A Fair Tax gives everyone skin in the game, which our current tax system does not. When the bottom two quintiles pay either no tax or receive a negative tax, they have no motivation to hold politicians accountable or to vote for policies and platforms that spend sensibly and effectively. Instead they will simply vote themselves their neighbor's income for their own benefit regardless of the detrimental effects.
1.7.13.1. Con: The current 'progressive' income tax system is actually highly regressive. It double taxes renters and subsidizes land owners. Wealthy individuals which own land and equity make most of money they pay in taxes back in the form of higher asset values boosted by government spending. Adding a regressive consumption tax would actually create demand for higher income tax to fight inequality, which is why countries with a VAT actually have higher total tax burden and reduced economic growth.
1.7.14. Con: If you think that taxes are immoral or unethical, making a slightly more palatable taxation system doesn't make it moral or ethical.
1.7.15. Con: The FairTax will result in higher taxes, as it will likely result in massive tax evasion and be replaced with a VAT. Countries which have adopted a VAT actually have a higher total tax burden and greater government spending. Since consumption taxes are highly regressive, introducing them creates greater demand for higher taxes and greater spending on social welfare programs in order to counteract the regressive effects and inequality they produce.
1.7.16. Con: There is no tax that is "fair." We need to work on getting rid of taxation entirely, not trying to make it palatable.
1.7.17. Con: It's more moral to pay and to collect taxes than to allow the outcomes that follow a financially failing government.
1.7.18. Con: The amount of taxation in governments like the USA's does not affect the accrued costs or expense, only whether they are paid promptly or paid by borrowing. It's only delaying the inevitable. The spending decisions have to be decided on their own merits.
1.7.18.1. Pro: Continually reinvestigating the tax code or the amount of tax has distracted legislators and voters from the more important discussion of what systems are worth paying for, or could be made more efficient. The resulting cycle of tax cuts and borrowing is only setting up government for financial disaster, not for lowering costs to citizens.
1.7.18.1.1. Con: Editing and improving the tax code is part of the legislature's burden, nonetheless.
1.8. Con: While the rebates are a good idea for Cost of living expenses, it has been demonstrated that a percent income tax applies equal burden to everyone, whereas a sales tax primarily burdens the poor and middle class, for whom a sales tax would constitute a greater portion of their weekly, and yearly income.
1.9. Con: An expenditure tax is [regressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regressive_tax), which is to say that it imposes a greater burden \(relative to resources\) on the poor than on the rich.
1.9.1. Pro: While the FT would tax everyone equally, the group that would benefit the most is the very wealthy \(since their income is currently taxed at around 35%, their take-home income under the FT would increase by roughly 50%\). I understand this is just a consequence of going from a skewed system to a balanced one, but many Americans would perceive this to be very unfair. Perhaps the FT should be amended to increase its tax rate, but also increase Prebates, thereby giving more to mid/low income tiers.
1.9.2. Pro: Sales tax is a worse tax form than payrolls:  it increases prices by a multiple of all costs and profits, and thus decreases consumer buying power and resultant jobs.
1.9.2.1. Con: The Fair Tax claims that prices for services and new retail items would not increase compared to current-day prices. Plus, the Fair Tax would not be applied to used services. Put together, we can conclude that income would increase and prices overall would decrease.
1.9.3. Con: The Fair Tax website [addresses the regressive issue](https://fairtax.org/articles/the-fairtax-is-not-regressive). I believe, as the article states, that the Prebate would indeed be a sufficient way to make it less regressive. Though an argument could be made that the Prebate could be higher.
1.9.4. Pro: The wealthiest taxpayers will end up paying much lower taxes under the FairTax, because they spend a much smaller fraction of their income, and because this tax rate is lower than the current rate they are supposed to pay. The poor, on the other hand, will end up paying a lot more taxes, since they spend everything they make and at a higher rate than they currently pay.
1.9.4.1. Con: Individuals who make lots of money, tend to not keep it. They don't save and are often not wealthy over time. Very few have the discipline to become wealthy. Read the first few pages of Millionaire Nextdoor [here](http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/stanley-millionaire.html) \(read the whole thing, but don't let presumptions about how the wealthy act skew your view of the FairTax\). Plenty of 'Big Hats No Cattle' will be eager to spend.
1.9.4.2. Con: A tax policy focused on wealth is problematic because the wealthy is not a set tribe or people group. The wealthy - if defined as high income in a given year - has high turnover from year to year. 72% of US taxpayers who make it into the IRS ‘Top 400’ are there for [only a single year](https://www.aei.org/publication/new-irs-data-show-that-72-of-us-taxpayers-who-make-it-into-the-top-400-are-there-for-only-a-single-year/). The wealthy as defined by high net worth, also has [high turnover](http://www.aei.org/publication/churnin-and-turnin-high-turnover-in-forbes-400/print/) as they are unable to hold their net worth over [long periods of time](http://humanprogress.org/static/3047).
1.9.4.3. Con: If the wealthy are not spending a high percentage of their income, and they are not saving it \(because it looses vallue over time\), then it must be given to charity \(which is good\), or invested \(in which case it will be taxed later with the additional money made from the investment\). The wealthy might not pay as much on earned income, but over their lifetime they will pay more because their income will increase.
1.9.4.4. Pro: Remember the movie "Brewster's Millions"? He had to spend a million dollars a day over 30 days to inherit 300 million. It's extremely difficult to do. The extremely high income generators don't have time to spend the money.
1.9.5. Con: "Taxing consumption is  effectively the same as taxing wages plus taxing wealth." [The Case for the 'FairTax'](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614173135/http://people.bu.edu/kotlikoff/WSJ%20Op%20Ed%203-7-05.pdf)
1.9.6. Pro: There are giant loopholes in the bill: the exemptions for property or services purchased for business, export, or investment purposes, and for state government functions. This GREATLY favors business owners and hurts workers. This is a tax on middle and lower class wherein upper class could claim "business" expenditures.
1.9.7. Pro: The prebate is insufficient to achieve a genuinely progressive taxation system, at least when compared with a tax scheme with any tiers that tax at a rate that's greater than 23%.
1.9.8. Con: Exceptions can easily be made to essential goods and services, such as food and electricity, while maintaining the sales tax on everything else.
1.9.8.1. Con: The more exceptions, and, particularly, the more variety of exceptions, the more the advantages of the proposal's simplicity, [for consumers](https://www.kialo.com/fairtax-would-improve-the-current-us-taxation-system-2813/2813.0=2813.1+2813.2) and [for government](https://www.kialo.com/fairtax-would-improve-the-current-us-taxation-system-2813/2813.0=2813.1+2813.3), are eroded.
1.9.8.1.1. Con: Simplicity can be partially maintained by the federal government delegating to the states. The federal government could use the states as the means to create specific untaxed goods based on need for regions. Ridiculous laws proposed by some states \(such as not taxing luxury cars, but still requiring the tax on cheaper models\) can be prevented by the federal government withholding federal funds.
1.9.9. Pro: This act eliminates six of nine tax brackets, lumping more people into only three brackets. Therefore it shifts the burden onto the middle class and lower class.
1.9.10. Pro: -> See 1.8.
1.9.11. Con: -> See 1.7.2.1.
1.9.12. Con: Given all income must be spent eventually \(and is then taxed\) in order to provide value to a person, both rich and poor pay pay the same proportion of tax on their resources over the course of their life. Thus expenditure taxes are normally flat; not a regressive. Simple classifications of taxes being regressive or progressive over a limited time period ignore the often-delayed manner in which expenditure is made.
1.9.13. Pro: Concentration of wealth and inter generational wealth transfer is a growing problem and a so called fair Tax would make it even worst.
1.9.14. Pro: Consumption of necessary goods is already a regressive tax significantly affecting lower income consumers. Based on this reality, we already know then how regressive taxation increases inequality. Making the tax system more regressive would then increase systemic inequality rather than decreasing it.
1.9.15. Con: Because the wealthy are likely to purchase the same things as the poor \(food, vehicles, housing\) but they will buy more expensive versions \(Ferrari vs Kia\) they will still pay significantly more in taxes which is not regressive.
1.9.16. Pro: A Family Consumption Allowance based on [current poverty guidelines](https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines) and a 23% tax rate would make an individual's refund equal to $2773.80 a year. This is much more regressive than the current system, in which, for example, taxpayers can get earned income tax credit of up to $6000.
1.9.16.1. Con: The current FICA tax, which is eliminated by the Fairtax, is highly regressive. Including the employer contribution, it is 14.4% of the first $127,000 in annual salary. People who make more than that do not pay this tax on the rest. This cap is of great benefit to high-income people makes the current FICA tax highly regressive.  Its elimination makes the Fairtax more progressive than the current tax system.
1.9.16.1.1. Con: The fix for regressive parts of the current part of the tax code is to make them progressive. Changing over to the Fair Tax, which is much more highly regressive, only exacerbates this issue.
1.9.16.2. Con: In 2016,  a family with two adults and three children with an income at  the Federal Poverty Level made $28,400. The Earned Income Tax Credit for this family was $5,282. The employee portion of FICA taxes were 7.2% of $28,400, which is $2,066. \(The employer portion was another 7.2%, which is not included in the present calculation.\). Under the current system, this family, therefore, had a spendable income of $31,616 \(but only if they filed a tax return\). \(28,400 - 2066 + 5282 = 31616\)
1.9.16.3. Con: Under the Fairtax, this family would not have the FICA taxes deducted, and would receive the Prebate of $6,532.   Thus, with the Fairtax, this family would have a spendable income of $34,932. \(23% of 28400 is 6532. 28400 + 6532 = 34932\)  This family would have over 10% more money to spend \($3,316\) under the Fairtax.   \(They would have even more since the employer would pass much of his portion of FICA tax savings also.\).  Thus the Fairtax is less regressive than the current system.
1.9.17. Pro: Tution fees are exempt from the FairTax. Given the price of education in the US, this benefits the wealthy attending universities more than it benefits the poor, because more wealthy people than poor people attend university in the US.
1.9.17.1. Con: Many schools, such as MIT, have a "if you can get in, you can afford it" policy.  Smart students can go to college.  This benefits both the rich and poor equally.
1.9.17.2. Con: Tuition fees *are* exempt from the FairTax because education is an investment. The FairTax places no additional burden on the poor in paying for education.
1.9.18. Con: The link below goes into gory detail about the definition of progressivity. It also concludes that the Fairtax is more progressive than the current system. [A Comparison of the Current Tax System and the FairTax Plan](http://www.beaconhill.org/FairTax2007/DistributionalAnalysis%20FairTaxBHI4-25-07.pdf)
1.9.18.1. Con: This prebate only partially absolves some of the regressiveness of the Fair Tax. Only allotting for a prebate up to the poverty line does nothing to address lack of progressive parity between lower middle, middle, upper middle, and upper class citizens.
1.9.18.2. Con: It is worth mentioning that the reference comes from a fiscally consirvative think thank, which of course would come to this conclusion. There is a much larger body of literature \(especially independent academic sources\), that finds that a fair tax is quite regressive, depending on how it is implemented.
1.9.18.3. Con: The source is one of a very small number of experts that believes in such optimistic numbers. No others experts seem to corroborate such optimistic expectations.
1.10. Con: -> See 1.6.13.1.
1.11. Pro: The Fair Tax would provide an incentive for Illegal Immigrants to legalize to become eligible for the prebate.  [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicted_effects_of_the_FairTax)
1.11.1. Con: There is no current process for illegal immigrants to "legalize."
1.12. Con: FairTax does not "effectively tax wealth," as supporters apparently claim \(according to Wiki article\). [\[Link\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairTax) Wealth is distinct from consumption. Not taxing wealth does not "improve the current US taxation system," it simply stops the taxation of wealth and replaces it with a tax consumers already pay.
