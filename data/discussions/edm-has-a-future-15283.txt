Discussion Title: EDM has a future

1. EDM has a future
1.1. Con: User created content streamed online has a negative impact on record sales.
1.1.1. Con: Artists can now go [platinum](https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2016/02/01/465178626/forget-selling-albums-artists-can-now-go-platinum-via-streaming) via online streaming platforms.
1.1.2. Con: More people than ever stream music, or listen to music on their way to work or during workouts. The demand should be large enough.
1.1.3. Pro: Paying a subscription fee discourages purchasing the physical media, like tape, CD or vinyl.
1.2. Con: Too many EDM artists follow a stand alone single strategy.
1.2.1. Con: As commercial models have changed and people generally buy singles, rather than LPs, this makes sense.
1.2.2. Pro: Being known for a hit single puts the artist at risk of becoming a "one hit wonder".
1.2.2.1. Con: Even artists with an ongoing career often only have one hit single per album they release.
1.2.3. Pro: Stand-alone singles are better for consumers.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Pre-internet, people were forced to buy the whole album to get the song or songs they actually wanted to listen to. Today the consumers can just buy the songs they actually like.
1.3. Pro: Dance music festivals are becoming more and more popular.
1.3.1. Pro: Many people listen to EDM at work, or while doing sports, as a regular rhythm helps concentration.
1.3.2. Con: Dance music festivals rely increasingly on visual spectacle to draw crowds. One can argue that the focus is therefore shifted away from the music.
1.4. Pro: EDM represents a radical departure from earlier dance music styles, like disco for instance.
1.4.1. Con: EDM itself has been around since the late 80s or early 90s, so it is almost 30 years old itself.
1.4.2. Pro: Producing dance music on a digital audio workstation sets EDM apart from other dance music styles.
1.5. Pro: Due to emphasis on beats and sampling versus traditional lyrical content and song structures, EDM can be enjoyed universally, independent of setting as well as background or language of the producer or listener. Without such cultural limits there will always be an audience.
1.6. Pro: EDM appeals to a youth market.
1.6.1. Con: To say that EDM appeals to a youth market is a gross generalisation.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Many techno fans who went clubbing in the 90s are now in their thirties or older and still enjoy EDM.
1.6.2. Pro: A [Nielsen survey](http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/who-is-the-electronic-music-listener.html) in 2014 showed the largest percentage of listeners, both male and female, to be between 18 and 24 years of age.
1.7. Pro: Music production software allows anyone to make music.
1.7.1. Con: Having access to software doesn't mean a person also has talent. We all have access to word processing software, yet very few of us are gifted authors.
1.7.2. Pro: The aspiring music producer can try and try again until he/she has emulated a successful EDM track.
1.8. Con: Anyone can make music, but that does not indicate quality.
1.8.1. Pro: Similarly, anyone can learn an instrument, but that does not mean they will be pleasant to listen to.
1.8.2. Con: Sometimes quality takes a back seat because of the intention behind the music – like punk, for instance.
1.8.2.1. Con: Punk heavily relies on the lyrics and message, whereas most EDM does not have any/much text.
1.8.2.2. Pro: "[Hieroglyphic Being](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/hieroglyphicbeing/biography)" produces [house](http://www.factmag.com/2015/11/18/hieroglyphic-being-interview-mix-rvng-intl/), where he goes for feeling or energy, rather than squeaky clean production.
1.8.3. Con: Tastes are personal and it doesn't exist a universal definition of what it should be considered art.
1.8.3.1. Pro: If someone enjoys EDM and thinks that is a form of art, that must be respected.
1.9. Con: EDM produced on a computer cannot be compared to other styles of dance music composed by actual musicians.
1.9.1. Con: Instruments have always evolved. There is no reason a synthesizer or other computer should not be considered a modern instrument.
1.9.2. Con: Carl Craig's Synthesizer Ensemble takes his techno music back to actual hardware. [Carl Craig live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xTvm4yTR3M)
1.9.3. Pro: Electronic music is programmed, rather than played. [Is electronic music real music?](https://www.quora.com/Is-electronic-music-real-music-Why-or-why-not)
