Discussion Title: Pride organisers should refuse corporate sponsorship

1. Pride organisers should refuse corporate sponsorship.
1.1. Pro: Pride celebrations should be focused on the community. Even the most postive corporate sponsorship detracts attention from them.
1.1.1. Con: The pride movement is about improving the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals. If corporate sponsorship and funding helps to further this goal, then pride organizers should welcome it.
1.1.2. Con: Corporate sponsorship draws media attention for the LGBTQ+ community.
1.1.2.1. Con: Media attention being drawn to pride can be very problematic - even dangerous - for people who are [LGBTQ+, but not out](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/19/gay-people-muslim-heritage-pride-london-march). These people may wish to attend but cannot risk having their photo taken and uploaded to facebook, used in a newspaper or similar.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Running advertising campaigns - TV ads, posters, billboards - to [maximise](https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/10/13/how-pride-londons-marketing-director-connecting-brands-the-lgbtq-cause) the number of people Pride reaches costs money. Often, corporate sponsorship is the only reason that Pride organisers can advertise the events to the extent that they do so.
1.1.2.3. Con: Not all forms of attention are good. Pride started of as a riot and now it's a corporate sponsored event. This gives the [impression](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/a3z4zg/pride-got-corporate-and-activists-got-pissed) that there are no longer any problems to solve, and that the LGBTQ+ community has truly become part of mainstream culture, whereas this is far from the case.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Corporate sponsorship of Pride [normalises and depoliticises](https://theconversation.com/the-rise-of-pride-marketing-and-the-curse-of-pink-washing-30925) the original social justice agenda of the LGBTQ+ movement: the focus turns from challenging inequalities in society to figuring out the best way to market the movement.
1.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Corporate sponsorship has turned what was once a political protest into a boozy, bacchanalian celebration; many believe that, under the weight of commercialisation, Pride has [lost sight](https://www.ft.com/content/228207c6-5f46-11e6-ae3f-77baadeb1c93) of its identity of protest and politics.
1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Corporate influence of Pride has pushed Pride into remaining [apolitical](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/a3z4zg/pride-got-corporate-and-activists-got-pissed), shutting out activists, and courting police and corporations that many feel are detrimental to the LGBTQ+ community, rather than campaigning on important issues that effect the community.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: As a result of Pride becoming apolitical, other marches have popped up to protest against issues that face the LGBTQ+ community. These include the [Equality March](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/a3z4zg/pride-got-corporate-and-activists-got-pissed) which centred on issues of violence against queer and trans people as well as racial justice. This goes to show that the media presence of Pride has been sanitised, and does not help the LGBTQ+ community.
1.1.2.3.3. Con: With increased coverage comes increased discourse through newspaper opinion pieces, discussions on TV as well as viewers wanting to find out more about Pride. This means people can become more aware of Pride, the progress made by the LGBTQ+ community and the struggles left to fight.
1.1.2.3.3.1. Pro: This discourse will largely discuss different elements of Pride \(as happens currently\) but would not exist if Pride was not as popular as newspapers tend to report on major events that large amounts of the public are interested in.
1.1.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: If there is no public interest in an issue, the public are unlikely to read an article on an issue or buy a newspaper that features this issue. This would reduce revenue for the paper \(through advertisements or sales\) so they are less likely to produce unpopular articles in the first place.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Corporate sponsors of Pride advertise themselves as LGBTQ+ friendly, and by doing so advertise acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community more broadly.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: In 2015, Barclays [used](https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/barclays-renews-pride-london-sponsorship-support-lgbt-community-promote-pingit/1343811) its partnership with Pride and the slogan ‘Ping for Pride’ to promote Pingit, which allowed anyone with a bank account, including non-Barclays customers, to donate money to Pride in London using their phone or via Twitter. This was a corporate sponsor encouraging people in society to donate to Pride.
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: During Pride month in 2017, Adidas [released](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/why-so-many-businesses-support-lgbt-rights/) a rainbow-flag makeover of its iconic Stan Smith trainer and devoted a portion of the sales to an Oregon-based charity supporting homeless LGBTQ+ teens. If nothing else, this raised awareness of homeless LGBTQ+ teens and the issues the community faces.
1.1.2.4.3. Con: Messages currently which come from corporations are often [criticised](https://gcn.ie/td-slams-paddy-power/) e.g. Smirnoff's 'Who gives a sexual' ad campaign.
1.1.2.4.4. Con: The advertisements by companies are never radical as companies want to avoid controversy; they only focus on LGBTQ+ issues that are broadly accepted within society.
1.1.2.4.4.1. Pro: Companies will tailor their Pride message to make it more palatable to consumers. In many parts of the world, consumers are more likely to be aware of and accepting of gay and lesbian people than other groups within the LGBTQ+ community.
1.1.2.5. Pro: Support of the LGBTQ+ community by household brands normalises acceptance of the community.
1.1.2.5.1. Con: Such support is very likely to generate backlash and radicalize opponents of the LGBTQ+ movement since it makes them feel like an "LGBTQ+ agenda" is being pushed on them through necessities and household goods.
1.1.2.5.2. Con: People usually do not think about advertisements in depth. If they see a Smirnoff ad it's likely they'll forget about it quickly or \(if they are incredibly unaware about the LGBTQ+ community\) probably not understand its link to the community.
1.1.2.5.3. Pro: People have a natural association with certain brands and their presence at Pride makes the event seem more like a "normal" parade which helps people accept it more.
1.1.2.5.3.1. Con: The increased acceptance of Pride is a result of the dilution of its core values and roots, rather than the public growing more accepting of LGBT+ people.
1.1.2.5.3.2. Con: Pride isn't supposed to fit within people's current view of what is normal, it's supposed to defy norms that people accept to be true and demand respect for a community that is often discriminated against.
1.1.2.5.3.2.1. Pro: People "accepting Pride" doesn't mean they accept the whole community, it just means that they think being gay is fine but these same people often exclude transgender individuals.
1.1.2.6. Con: Pride is a massive event that gained media attention even when it was a small movement. Thousands of LGBTQ+ people celebrating their identity will still get media attention.
1.1.2.7. Con: Corporations massively block out other groups from getting attention during Pride. Recently Apple had [8000 employees](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/san-francisco-gay-pride-corporate-orlando-shooting) march in San Francisco Pride.
1.1.2.7.1. Pro: This caused the parade to drag on [two hours](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Apple-provides-too-much-of-a-good-thing-at-Pride-6363728.php) longer than usual, with Apple employees making up more than a quarter of marchers.
1.1.2.7.2. Pro: By virtue of these thousands of employees marching, it means that there is less space for members of the LGBTQ+ community to actively take part in Pride.
1.1.3. Con: By assuming that the LGBTQ+ community is separate to corporations it says that LGBTQ+ employees are not true community members. Corporations employ LGBTQ+ people and often these employees facilitate sponsorship of Pride and other LGBTQ+ events. This is a way for these LGBTQ+ people to celebrate Pride and is no less legitimate than anyone else's way in which they engage with Pride.
1.1.3.1. Pro: For some LGBTQ+ Pride is a protest, for others it's a celebration. For others again, they don't want to engage with Pride because they don't like it. All of these are valid ways for LGBTQ+ people to engage with Pride and we cannot rank one over the other.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: To do so would place a ranking of certain kinds of LGBTQ+ views and experiences and say they are more valid than others.
1.1.3.2. Con: Since corporations are amoral actors, they only sponsor causes when it is profitable for them to do so.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: There is [no](https://www.ft.com/content/228207c6-5f46-11e6-ae3f-77baadeb1c93) corporate sponsorship for the Pride march in Uganda, where there has been significant escalation in vitriolic homophobic rhetoric from government officials over the past 10 years - this indicates a lack of genuine belief in the movement, but more just co-opting it for profits.
1.1.3.3. Con: Individual employees do not necessarily decide the social outlook of a company, executives do. As they are unlikely to be LGBTQ+, their outlook is often at odds with the LGBTQ+ community's goals.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: While there are [some openly LGBT](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/10/30/ceos-who-are-openly-gay.html) CEOs, it is likely that the majority of them come from more privileged groups within the LGBTQ+ community who are less likely to understand or acknowledge the issues facing less privileged groups. For example, cisgender gay men are unlikely to push for support of minority LGBTQ+ groups such as transgender women of colour.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Cisgender gay men are likely to understand the oppression that other members of the LGBTQ+ community have experienced as they have \(in a different way\) experienced discrimination. Given this they are likely to try and combat such oppression and will push to support all members of the LGBTQ+ community.
1.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Corporate sponsored pride events often push sexualities to the forefront while leaving more vulnerable groups such as [transgender people](http://www.dailydot.com/irl/pride-month-lgbtq-party/) behind.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: Corporate sponsorship [entrenches](https://theconversation.com/the-rise-of-pride-marketing-and-the-curse-of-pink-washing-30925) power dynamics within the LGBTQ+ community: marketers continue to avoid targeting or portraying lesbians, and other forms of sexual identities, including bisexuality and transsexual identities, are virtually absent from any form of commercial representation.
1.1.3.3.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.4.1.
1.1.3.3.1.2.3. Pro: This can be particularly harmful as often groups who are more marginal within the LGBTQ+ community face more discrimination than others.
1.1.3.3.1.2.3.1. Pro: While LGBTQ+ individuals are [more likely](http://www.newsweek.com/lgbt-youth-homeless-study-727595) to become homeless in general, it was estimated that [20% of transgender people](http://www.nhchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/in-focus_transgender_sep2014_final.pdf) in the US were homeless in 2014.
1.1.3.3.1.2.3.2. Pro: In particular a clear focus on sexuality can be very alienating to people on the asexual spectrum.
1.1.3.3.1.2.4. Pro: This focus on sex and sexuality can also serve to further entrench [stereotypes](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/19/gay-men-promiscuous-myth) such as promiscuity and hypersexuality.
1.1.3.3.1.2.4.1. Pro: There's currently a call for [more](https://www.nyunews.com/2016/09/26/nonsexual-queer-spaces-needed-in-nyc/) non-sexualised LGBTQ+ spaces, as there is an inherent belief that non-straight sexuality is tied directly to sex.
1.1.3.3.1.2.5. Con: Even if this is true, gay and lesbian people still face discrimination and any progress \(even if not perfect\) is better than no progress.
1.1.3.3.1.2.5.1. Con: It is principally illegitimate for some factions of the community to benefit as a direct result of other groups in the community being left behind.
1.1.3.3.1.2.5.1.1. Con: Sexual minorities may gain a greater benefit from Pride than transgender people, but that is not the same as gaining a benefit by harming the Transgender movement.
1.1.3.3.1.3. Pro: Working to improve the societal treatment of marginalized groups is expensive and politically difficult. As such LGBTQ+ CEOs have incentives to focus their efforts on less marginalized groups - particularly when they are a part of those groups.
1.1.3.3.1.4. Pro: Transgender individuals see significantly worse economic and social opportunities in the workplace [\(Davidson\)](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=sociol_grad_pubs). As a result, it is likely that fewer transgender individuals will rise to high level executive positions, such as CEO, within corporations.
1.1.3.3.1.5. Pro: There are [no](https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2017/5/08/transgender-ceo-martine-rothblatt-talks-transition-trump-and-true-love-video) Transgender CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, and only a couple of transgender CEOs overall.
1.1.3.3.2. Pro: [0.3%](https://www.executivegrapevine.com/content/article/news-2017-10-26-the-pink-ceiling-what-should-executive-search-do-about-it) of Fortune 500 directors openly identify as LGBTQ+.
1.1.4. Pro: When media outlets want to interview people about Pride, they will have to devote some time to sponsors as it’s likely to be part of sponsorship agreements as companies want to advertise themselves positively.
1.1.5. Con: People still view sports events as being about the sport rather than the sponsor; the same is likely to be true of pride.
1.1.6. Pro: Pride organisers have the size of parades limited by local governments to minimise disruption. When pride organisers have to choose between a corporate float and a LGBTQ+ charity, they are incentivised to choose the former as they can offer more money.
1.1.6.1. Con: This assumes that LGBTQ+ individuals who organise pride are only motivated by profit and do not know or care about the struggles of the community. This is unlikely, considering those who organise pride are likely involved in other LGBTQ+ groups and activism.
1.2. Pro: Corporate aims are at odds with the aims of the community.
1.2.1. Pro: Corporations may be unwilling to associate themselves with the political goals of the LGBTQ+ community, which often align against conservative political forces. Since corporations sympathise with the economic platforms of conservative political actors, they may put pressure on pride events to ignore important political causes for the LGBTQ+ community.
1.2.1.1. Pro: When LA Pride rebranded as an anti-Trump march in 2017, longtime supporters like Wells Fargo, Vegas.com, Bud Light, and Skyy Vodka [pulled out](http://thefightmag.com/2017/04/advertisers-pull-out-of-anti-trump-pride-resist-march-bye-felicia/).
1.2.1.2. Con: The majority of political goals of the LGBTQ+ community are not anti-conservative economic ones that affect corporations but rather anti-conservative social ones \(such as[bathroom use and religious freedom laws\)](https://www.history.com/topics/history-of-gay-rights) which promote human rights and equality for LGBTQ+ individuals. These social goals succeeding does not affect the profits of corporations so they are unlikely to oppose.
1.2.1.3. Con: Companies are not homogeneous. For every conservative one, another liberal one can take its place.
1.2.2. Pro: Successful corporations tend to like and preserve the existing social and economic order. Many prominent LGBTQ+ [campaigners](https://missionlocal.org/2010/06/take-five-gay-shame/) argue that in order to improve the welfare of LGBTQ+ people, fundamental institutions of society such as marriage and the military ought to be dismantled.
1.2.3. Con: Corporate sponsorship of Pride makes it easier for LGBTQ+ activists to call out the hypocrisy of corporations that fail to respect LGBTQ+ rights. As a result, corporate aims can be brought in line with the aims of the community.
1.2.3.1. Con: When corporations are contributing [£400,000](http://www.google.ie/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/228207c6-5f46-11e6-ae3f-77baadeb1c93) to their events, it becomes difficult for the community to hold companies accountable for fear of losing that capital.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: The LGBTQ+ community is not a homogeneous entity. While it may be true that the people organising Pride parades feel beholden to corporate interests, those outside of Pride feel no such pressure to stay silent on the behaviour of corporations.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: The relatively widespread [protest](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/06/16/why-these-lgbt-groups-protesting-pride/399043001/) by LGBTQ+ groups against Pride is itself evidence that corporate sponsorship has not silenced dissent in the LGBTQ+ community.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Budweiser has been criticised for simultaneously sponsoring Pride and the FIFA 2018 [World Cup](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/06/25/budweiser-pride-world-cup-criticism-lgbt-rights/) in Russia, a country with an abysmal record on LGBTQ+ rights.
1.2.3.3. Pro: People are more likely to notice and criticise corporate failures to respect LGBTQ+ rights when, they can contrast that with the hypocritical rhetoric of those corporations. This can mean that corporate failures are more likely to be noticed, campaigned against and eventually remedied.
1.2.4. Pro: [Substance](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/substance-use-suds-in-lgbt-populations), [tobacco](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222279/) and alcohol abuse and addiction have been identified as serious problems facing the LGBTQ+ community. Sponsorship by companies such as [Smirnoff](https://www.conveniencestore.co.uk/products/smirnoff-sponsors-pride-with-chooselove-campaign/553562.article) may undermine efforts to address this issue.
1.2.4.1. Con: There are big benefits to including [The Alcohol Industry](http://inspiredeconomist.com/2011/04/13/responsibilities-of-the-alcohol-industry/) in attempts to curb substance abuse.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: The existence of the alcohol industry is [dependent](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2014/10/05/the-alcohol-industry-needs-alcoholism-to-thrive/) on the existence of alcoholics.
1.2.5. Pro: Corporate sponsorship is at odds with Pride's history of protest.
1.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Recent sponsorship has turned Pride into less of a protest for equality and more of a [festival or party](https://metro.co.uk/2017/06/23/is-pride-in-london-still-a-protest-or-is-it-more-of-an-excuse-to-party-6727319/).
1.2.5.2.1. Con: The fact that pride can be more celebratory now is a good thing as celebration should happen as a result of the progress that has been made in terms of LGBTQ+ equality \(e.g. same sex marriage, gender recognition bills\).
1.2.5.2.2. Pro: Increasingly, crowds at Pride are more interested in the pop tribute acts than the political speeches, the food huts than the charity stalls, and commercial floats and banners were more visible than protest placards. Corporate sponsorship [shifts the focus](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jordan-daly/gay-pride-should-be-about_b_17744760.html?guccounter=1) from Pride as a protest to discrimination to Pride as a big party.
1.2.5.2.2.1. Con: If the participants at pride \(presumably LGBTQ+ individuals\) are more interested in pop tribute acts, then this demonstrates a shift in the community towards what they view pride as rather than this shift being the fault of corporations.
1.2.5.2.2.2. Pro: Viewing Pride as a party and not a protest detracts attention from battles the LGBTQ+ community continues to fight and only focuses on relatively privileged members of the community.
1.2.5.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.
1.2.5.2.2.2.2. Con: Pride can simultaneously be a protest and a party. It is not wrong to celebrate the successes made by the LGBTQ+ community over the last few decades and this is not mutually exclusive with acknowledging there are more struggles ahead.
1.2.5.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.2.1.
1.2.5.2.3. Con: Marches, festivals and parties raise awareness about the LGBTQ+ community which has a positive social impact.
1.2.5.2.4. Pro: Having pride as just a celebration makes it only open to individuals who are out and who face the least amount of discrimination, typically white, gay men.
1.2.6. Con: LGBTQ+ individuals are not a cohesive political group with defined or universal aims. Corporate aims therefore cannot contradict LGBTQ+ aims.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Individuals typically do not choose to be LGBTQ+. As a result, the community encompasses people of a diverse set of backgrounds and political views.
1.2.6.2. Con: As LGBTQ+ individuals face many of the same issues, they tend to be aligned on many political, social and cultural views. Even if they are not entirely uniform, the aims are distinct enough from broadly conservative corporate interests that they can be said to conflict.
1.2.6.2.1. Pro: A [2016](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/25/lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-voters-remain-a-solidly-democratic-bloc/) study found that 82% LGB people in the United States identified with or leaned towards the Democratic party.
1.2.6.2.2. Con: Corporations are similarly not homogeneous with many liberal ones existing as well as conservative ones; it is untrue to say that all corporations are conservative and therefore at odds with the LGBTQ+ community.
1.2.6.3. Pro: Saying that corporate involvement in pride is wrong alienates LGBTQ+ individuals who either work for corporations or don't regard them as bad.
1.2.6.3.1. Pro: Pride is meant to be an inclusive event and someone who is LGBTQ+ should not be excluded on the basis of their political views.
1.2.7. Con: In the absence of corporate funding, Pride would likely have to resort to government funding. Such funding is both [fickle](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2010/05/08/stephen_harper_government_wont_fund_toronto_gay_pride_festival.html) and may come with demands that Pride discard its political and protest elements.
1.2.7.1. Pro: Government funding for Pride parades may provoke conservative political [backlash](https://torontosun.com/2017/04/22/funding-this-years-pride-parade-unforgivable/wcm/694687b2-3e46-41c6-9e62-0a006e530a6a).
1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.4. Con: Corporate sponsorship helps financially support Pride events.
1.4.1. Pro: Corporate sponsorship gives Pride the funds to support a better Pride experience for attendees. These funds support [entertainment](https://www.nycpride.org/events/pridefest/), [art installations](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/pride-month-2018-1.4686882) and even [human rights conferences](https://www.nycpride.org/events/human-rights-conference/).
1.4.2. Pro: As Pride events grow, they face additional legal requirements which burden them with high costs. These include insurance and security requirements. Without financial aid from corporations, it may not be possible for Pride events to continue at their current scale.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Oklahoma City Pride after unexpected additional [security costs](https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2017/5/10/stop-being-purity-police-over-corporate-sponsorship-pride) amounting to $15,000 were incurred in the wake of the Orlando [Pulse Nightclub Shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_nightclub_shooting).
1.4.3. Pro: Without corporate sponsorship, Pride marches as they exist today would not be possible.
1.4.3.1. Pro: It costs nearly £1m to [organise](https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/10/13/how-pride-londons-marketing-director-connecting-brands-the-lgbtq-cause) Pride in London, and a substantial amount of that money comes from corporate sponsorship. Without that money, Pride in London would have to reduce its size considerably.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Around [50%](https://www.ft.com/content/228207c6-5f46-11e6-ae3f-77baadeb1c93) of the $2.4 million budget for New York's Pride parade comes from corporate sponsorship.
1.4.4. Pro: Sponsorship of Pride allows it to include more people than ever before.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Pride events now attract hundreds of thousands of people to them. This allows many more people to attend and participate in Pride and bigger crowds allow for larger parades which can represent more LGBTQ+ groups.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: As pride has become bigger it has only become more inclusive to groups that are "palatable" to wider society, leaving many in the community [left out](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/06/16/why-these-lgbt-groups-protesting-pride/399043001/).
1.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: These members of the community are often those who should be represented most as Pride's [original aim](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/charlene-obernauer/whats-the-point-of-pride-marches_b_3462807.html) was to represent those who faced discrimination and challenge norms.
1.4.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.3.
1.4.4.1.1.2. Con: Corporate Sponsorship may just involve the logo of the sponsoring company appearing on banners, rather than that corporation marching in the parade. This does not prevent other LGBTQ+ groups from marching, having banners or continuing to protest as part of Pride.
1.4.4.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: The more finance an event has, the more it is able to expand as it can now cover the costs of the extra security needed to expand, as well as larger venues or longer parade routes.
1.4.4.2. Con: Many LGBTQ+ individuals feel alienated from Pride due to its corporate sponsorship as they do not feel that those corporations are true allies.
1.4.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.4.5. Con: When corporations spend money on pride, a significant portion is spent on their own floats, banners, balloons etc. meaning all the money does not go to helping pride in general.
1.4.6. Pro: The proponents of banning corporate sponsorship have not identified a way to pay for pride celebrations while keeping them free to attend.
1.4.7. Con: Corporations often just sponsor events in [already liberal locations](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywz775/pride-themed-advertising-is-everywhere-but-hold-your-applause) like New York City to minimise backlash without helping Pride events in areas that need support more.
1.4.7.1. Con: Supporting Pride in liberal areas still helps Pride to grow and awareness of it to grow. Simply because funding does not go to all locations is not a reason to refuse it.
1.5. Con: The LGBTQ+ community should welcome the assistance corporations can provide to their cause, rather than alienating them.
1.5.1. Pro: Refusal by prominent Pride organisers to accept sponsorship from major corporations may alienate those corporations and cause them to either ignore or work against LGBTQ+ causes in the future.
1.5.1.1. Con: Providing an inclusive environment for employees to work in makes them more productive; workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees is just good for the [bottom line](https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2017-10-13/lgbt-friendly-policies-make-business-sense#close-modal) of corporations. The refusal of Pride to sign a sponsorship contract is not going to make a corporation hurt itself.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: A diverse workforce [means](https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2017-10-13/lgbt-friendly-policies-make-business-sense#close-modal) a bigger pool of ideas and solutions, allowing corporations to remain competitive.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Being [perceived](https://www.ft.com/content/cece1e92-920f-11e6-8df8-d3778b55a923) as LGBTQ+-friendly can help an employer shed a traditional image which might turn off consumers, jobseekers and clients.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Studies have [shown](https://newrepublic.com/article/119528/lgbt-friendly-companies-dont-lose-money) that LGBTQ+-supportive practices have a positive impact on LGBTQ+ employee satisfaction, workplace relationships, and job commitment, and in turn, increased productivity and creativity. In short, the more comfortable LGBTQ+ employees feel at their workplace, the happier they are; the happier they are, the better they work.
1.5.1.2. Con: 94 percent of Fortune 500 companies have [formal policies](https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2017-10-13/lgbt-friendly-policies-make-business-sense#close-modal) banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and three-fourths include gender identity and gender expression in their anti-bias policies - this trend is unlikely to reverse simply because Pride decides they don't want corporate sponsorship.
1.5.1.3. Con: The financial incentives that drive companies to want to partner with Pride organizations would likely deter them form working against Pride if their offers for sponsorship were refused.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: Deliberately working against LGBT+ causes will only serve to bring the corporation into disrepute and damage it's public image.
1.5.1.3.1.1. Pro: The LGTBQ+ community is able to [mobilise](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/north-carolina-and-the-gay-rights-backlash) when discriminatory laws are passed against them; the community will likely do the same if any corporation tries to actively discriminate against them.
1.5.1.3.1.2. Pro: Businesses today [compete](http://time.com/4292758/business-support-lgbt-rights-north-carolina/) on social-responsibility branding; they need to be seen taking a stand on important cultural issues, including LGBTQ+ ones. Any moves taken by a corporation that actively hurts its corporate social responsibly message will ultimately hurt its bottom line.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: [Urban Outfitters](https://www.hrc.org/press/hrc-condemns-urban-outfitters-latest-offense-tapestry-with-nazi-era-anti-ga) was under fire recently for anti-LGBTQ+ products; they have since changed their ways and [are donating proceeds](http://hiskind.com/urban-outfitters-to-release-pride-collection-benefitting-lgbt-charities-this-june/) to LGBTQ+ charities.
1.5.1.3.1.3. Con: Being pro-LGBTQ+ is only beneficial to companies with majority LGBTQ+ friendly customers. Companies whose customers are LGBTQ+ unfriendly have the [opposite](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chick-fil-a-gay-marriage/) incentive.
1.5.1.3.1.4. Con: The majority of Americans [oppose](http://time.com/4698392/transgender-bathroom-bill-poll/) bathroom bills; corporations taking a stand against them doesn't come with any risk of losing their consumer base.
1.5.1.4. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.
1.5.2. Pro: Lots of LGBTQ+ individuals work for large corporations.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Public corporate displays at Pride send a message that is more than a desire for profits from the queer community. For many who have never experienced it before, they bestow a [sense of dignity](https://medium.com/reaching-out/why-i-think-there-is-a-place-for-corporations-during-pride-month-36dccd32f4b4) in the workplace many never thought possible.
1.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.
1.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.5.2.4. Pro: The narrative surrounding corporate sponsorship of pride being harmful is always that corporations are inherently hetero-normative and therefore should not sponsor pride; this is not the reality as many employees are LGBTQ+ individuals.
1.5.2.4.1. Con: Many people lie about their orientation during the hiring process, and [20%](https://www.npr.org/documents/2017/nov/npr-discrimination-lgbtq-final.pdf?t=1530733712763) of LGBTQ+ Americans have experienced discrimination at work or when applying for work.
1.5.2.4.2. Con: Starbucks, a gold level sponsor at London Pride, are currently in the midst of a lawsuit focusing on [transgender discrimination](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/12/27/court-reinstates-transgender-mans-discrimination-suit-against-starbucks/).
1.5.2.4.3. Con: Target sponsored NYC Pride this year, yet their former CEO made large donations to [anti-LGBTQ+ polliticians.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/27/target-homophobia-ceo-gre_n_660990.html)
1.5.2.4.4. Con: Delta Airlines, a sponsor of NYC Pride in 2018, have previously [censored](http://flavorwire.com/587832/delta-airlines-censored-gay-kissing-but-now-theyre-censoring-homophobic-words-too) same-sex kisses in films shown on flights, while not editing out similar heterosexual scenes.
1.5.2.5. Pro: Sponsorship of Pride allows workplaces to be more accepting of their LGBTQ+ staff and make it a nicer place to work.
1.5.2.5.1. Con: Corporations could still prove they are allies or show their employees they are being supportive by sponsoring LGBTQ+ charities and other groups.
1.5.2.5.2. Con: Moves like this by corporations are often tokenism to say they are engaging in Corporate Social Responsibility rather than being real support.
1.5.2.5.2.1. Pro: Tokenism is unlikely to materially improve the conditions of workers, as it is used to give the impression that progress is being made without implementing policy changes in the company.
1.5.2.5.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.5.2.5.2.2. Pro: The message coming from LGBT+ diversity groups within companies are still likely to have a corporate lens, which will always differ at least slightly from the experience of less privileged LGBT+ individuals.
1.5.2.5.3. Pro: When Pride is discussed within the workplace, more employees are aware and likely to be more accepting of their LGBTQ+ colleagues.
1.5.2.5.4. Pro: Having your company sponsor Pride can have a massive signalling affect that your workplace respects and celebrates your identity.
1.5.2.5.4.1. Con: If you face discrimination in your workplace, you won't feel comforted by one week of awareness for pride when the other 51 weeks of the year you feel your identity is being attacked.
1.5.3. Pro: Corporations have become a key ally of the LGBTQ+ movement, and have aided the movement in many ways.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Corporations can and do use their '[soft power](https://www.ft.com/content/71a81884-2320-11e6-9d4d-c11776a5124d)' around the world to influence LGBTQ+-friendly attitudes and policies.
1.5.3.2. Pro: North Carolina's "bathroom bill", which limited LGBTQ+ protections, will [cost the state](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/27/bathroom-bill-to-cost-north-carolina-376-billion.html) more than $3.76 billion in lost business over a dozen years, all because businesses boycotted the state over the discriminatory law. These boycotts led to the [repeal](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/30/politics/north-carolina-hb2-agreement/index.html) of the law, a clear example of corporations ending discriminatory practices.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.4.
1.5.3.3. Pro: Corporate America [actively fought](http://www.newsweek.com/2015/07/10/shift-corporate-america-social-issues-become-good-business-348458.html) to legalise same-sex marriage in the US.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: 379 corporations and employer organizations had [urged](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/marriage-equality-amicus_n_6808260) the Supreme Court to strike down state bans on gay marriage.
1.5.3.4. Con: Many corporations are [actively](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/16/anti-gay-companies_n_4110344.html) anti-LGBTQ+.
1.5.3.4.1. Con: Then these corporations should not be allowed to sponsor Pride, but their stance should not prejudice the good work many other companies do for their LGBTQ+ employees, customers and the movement more widely.
1.5.3.5. Pro: A religious freedom law in Indiana which permitted businesses to discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community based on religious beliefs was revised [primarily](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/corporate-americas-evolution-on-l-g-b-t-rights) due to opposition from the business world.
1.5.3.6. Pro: Major corporations have access to far greater political, monetary and advertising resources than the LGBT+ movement.
1.5.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.
1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.6.
1.5.5. Con: The money corporations spend on pride to show they are allies would be better used if given to an LGBTQ+ charity or to other smaller LGBTQ+ groups attending pride.
1.5.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.
1.5.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.5.1.
1.5.6. Con: When they have more influence they get to set the message about pride, not individuals who are LGBTQ+ meaning an incorrect message is often sent.
1.5.6.1. Con: Companies which sponsor pride tend to have diversity groups within them who are made up of LGBTQ+ individuals.
1.5.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.5.2.2.
1.5.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.3.
1.5.6.2. Con: It is untrue to say that it is only corporations who get the message wrong about Pride. London Pride in 2017 was heavily [criticised for posters](https://www.indy100.com/article/london-pride-being-homophobic-is-soo-gay-posts-lgbtq-anger-7814896) which came from its main organising body, not corporations.
1.6. Pro: It is morally wrong for corporations to profit off of a communities' struggles.
1.6.1. Pro: Often large corporations are complicit in hiring and promoting practices that discriminate against LGBTQ+ people.
1.6.1.1. Con: Rejecting sponsorship from companies that engage in discriminatory practices does not reduce the effect or incidence of such discrimination.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: If being seen as LGBTQ+ friendly is important to businesses, the loss of sponsorship opportunities may be an incentive for companies to change their business practices.
1.6.1.1.2. Con: It is bad for the LGBTQ+ movement to associate with companies that engage in discriminatory behaviour.
1.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: The LGBTQ+ movement is likely to look bad when it is revealed that their sponsors have been engaged in discriminatory behaviour.
1.6.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: LGBTQ+ individuals are likely to lose faith in the movement and its ability to better their lives.
1.6.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Sympathetic individuals are less likely to donate to a movement they perceive prioritizes corporate interests over the well being of its own members.
1.6.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.4.4.
1.6.1.1.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.4.2.
1.6.1.1.2.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.4.3.
1.6.1.1.2.1.6. Pro: Target sponsors Pride in New York City while also [taking a stand](https://corporate.target.com/article/2016/04/target-stands-inclusivity) against anti-transgender bathroom bills.
1.6.1.1.2.1.6.1. Con: These actions could be consistent with a company attempting to increase profit if they belie their customers will respond positively to an inclusive and liberal brand image.
1.6.1.1.2.1.6.1.1. Con: As a consumer base, the LGBTQ+ community is worth approximately [$3.7 trillion](https://www.ft.com/content/228207c6-5f46-11e6-ae3f-77baadeb1c93) annually.
1.6.1.1.2.2. Pro: It is principally wrong for a movement to associate with companies that discriminate against the individuals that movement is trying to protect.
1.6.1.1.3. Con: Being perceived as LGBTQ+ friendly makes it less likely that discriminatory companies are scrutinized on their employment practices. It also makes it easier for companies to deflect allegations of discrimination by using their association with the Pride movement. These companies are therefore more likely to be able to get away with discrimination.
1.6.1.1.4. Pro: Companies will discriminate either way. The pride movement should use that money to provide some benefit to the LGBTQ+ community, even if that benefit is simply running a better parade.
1.6.1.1.4.1. Con: Sponsorship of Pride events goes to funding pride events, not materially improving the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals.
1.6.1.1.5. Pro: An ongoing relationship fostered by a sponsorship makes it more likely that the LGBTQ+ movement will be able to reduce discrimination at such companies.
1.6.1.1.5.1. Con: This ongoing relationship exists with a power dynamic that means scrutiny and change are unlikely.
1.6.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.6.1.1.6. Pro: The individuals who run companies, and set their hiring policy, are human. Humans need to rationalize their decisions and as such will find it difficult to continue to discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals whilst also funding the pride movement.
1.6.1.1.6.1. Pro: This is similar to the [Foot-in-the-door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique) technique. When someone does a favour for someone they dislike, they tend to justify this decision by deciding they liked the person they did the favour for.
1.6.1.1.6.2. Pro: Funding the Pride movement requires fostering business relationships with LGBTQ+ individuals. It is much harder to engage in discrimination against a group once you associate with them regularly.
1.6.1.1.6.3. Con: Since funding the Pride movement does not require actually supporting LGBTQ+ rights, it is quite easy to reconcile both these positions as merely being financially sound decisions.
1.6.1.2. Con: A significant amount of bias that exists currently comes from individuals with [subconscious biases](https://www.ft.com/content/7d8b6f86-8fa7-11e6-a72e-b428cb934b78) rather than policies within corporations. This bias is a problem with society as a whole rather than the individual companies.
1.6.2. Pro: Sponsorship of Pride can result in companies earning substantially more than the amount given in sponsorship.
1.6.2.1. Con: All corporate sponsorship must be profitable for the sponsor - that is the reason sponsorship exists.
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.6.2.2. Con: Whether or not the corporate sponsor receives a benefit from sponsorship is irrelevant to the discussion of whether or not pride organizers should accept sponsorships.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: The sole consideration for whether or not sponsorships are accepted ought to be whether or not those sponsorships benefit the LGBTQ+ community.
1.6.2.2.1.1. Con: When a community has been fighting to be accepted for decades, it is is reasonable for them to discount or discredit "support" that comes not from acceptance, but from corporations seeking to benefit themselves.
1.6.2.2.2. Pro: Corporations benefiting from a sponsorship deal is not mutually exclusive with the LGBTQ+ community benefiting from the same deal.
1.6.2.2.2.1. Pro: Most commercial transactions are profitable and beneficial to all parties involved.
1.6.2.3. Pro: Often, companies do not give out of support for LGBTQ+ groups, but rather as a mechanism to make more profit.
1.6.2.3.1. Pro: Perceived traits such as style-consciousness, the early adoption of new products, and a higher-than-average disposable income make gay consumers a [profitable](https://www.ft.com/content/228207c6-5f46-11e6-ae3f-77baadeb1c93) target demographic.
1.6.2.3.2. Pro: Brands are [increasingly](https://www.ft.com/content/228207c6-5f46-11e6-ae3f-77baadeb1c93) recognising the cachet that comes with aligning themselves with progressive social causes, and are trying to capitalise on a 'first-mover advantage', where corporate brands try to be the first ones to sponsor different Pride events.
1.6.2.3.3. Con: Even if this is correct, the sponsorship given to Pride events allows for those events to be run and without it lots of these events could not function.
1.6.2.3.3.1. Pro: The intention is irrelevant \(i.e. because they are allies or because they want to make a profit\) if the same end goal - i.e. a bigger pride parade - is achieved.
1.6.2.3.3.1.1. Con: Intention matters because sponsorship of Pride also grants control over the direction and incentives of the movement. Should individuals who are ideologically uninterested in Pride gain such control it will be reflected in the Pride movement.
1.6.2.3.4. Con: This is not always true - a number of brands, among them General Electric, Whole Foods and Pepsi, [refused](https://www.ft.com/content/228207c6-5f46-11e6-ae3f-77baadeb1c93) to do business with the state of North Carolina in response to the passing of the HB2 “bathroom bill”. Corporations do genuinely believe in the LGBTQ+ movement and its purpose and want to help.
1.6.2.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.2.1.6.1.
1.6.2.3.5. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.2.1.6.
1.6.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.1.2.1.6.1.1.
1.6.2.5. Con: Sponsorship is the company getting its name / logo on a banner and paying a large amount of money for it. It's not something companies make a 'substantial' amount from.
1.6.2.5.1. Con: Sponsorship of Pride events makes it more likely that LGBTQ+ individuals will buy products from said sponsor.
1.6.2.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.1.2.1.6.1.1.
1.6.2.5.2. Con: The reason companies are willing to pay money to have their name and logo show up on a banner is because it makes them a substantial amount of money.
1.6.2.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.6.3. Pro: Corporations are only sponsoring Pride now as it is now popular to do so.
1.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Bill Dobbs, a prominent LGBTQ+ activist, [claims](http://www.google.es/amp/s/www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/qv4ypb/can-a-pride-be-proud-with-unethical-corporate-sponsorship) that economic justice can't be achieved with Pride in the pocket of corporate America.
1.6.3.3. Con: While part of the reason why corporations help Pride is because it is good for profits, corporations have also led the field in [changing](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/corporate-americas-evolution-on-l-g-b-t-rights) the views of many people about the LGBTQ+ community. It is wrong to say that the only reason corporations are sponsoring Pride is because it is popular to do so when they have played a part in making it popular to do so in the first place.
1.6.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.
1.6.4. Con: The companies that sponsor Pride actually care about their LGBTQ+ employees and the LGBTQ+ movement more broadly.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Of the 10 corporations singled out by [No Justice No Pride](http://nojusticenopride.org/), an organisation that rejects corporate involvement with Pride, all had [perfect scores](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/CEI-2018-FullReport.pdf) on the Corporate Equality Index, which is an organisation which measures the LGBTQ+ friendliness of corporate workplaces.
1.6.4.2. Pro: A comprehensive [study](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/CEI-2018-FullReport.pdf) of Fortune 500 companies found that in 2018, 91% of companies included sexual orientation in their non-discrimination policies, and 83% of companies included gender identity in the same policies. It is therefore untrue to say that a significant proportion of corporations are complicit in discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals.
1.6.4.3. Con: It is a [stretch to say that these companies care](http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-workplace-issues) about their LGBTQ+ employees and the cause more broadly.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: Companies continue to refuse to recognize family leave for same sex couples.
1.6.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.4.1.
1.6.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.4.2.
1.6.4.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.4.3.
1.6.4.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.4.4.
1.6.5. Con: Sponsoring Pride is not the same thing as profiting from the struggles of the LGBTQ+ community. Pride is a celebration of the LGBTQ+ community and its diversity, not solely a vigil for the struggles of the community.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Currently, Pride comprises primarily of [parties, parades and celebrations](https://www.ft.com/content/228207c6-5f46-11e6-ae3f-77baadeb1c93) and is less focused on discussion of discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals.
1.6.6. Pro: Allowing corporate sponsorship creates an incentive to [pinkwash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkwashing_\(LGBT\)).
1.6.6.1. Pro: Israel [uses](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/opinion/pinkwashing-and-israels-use-of-gays-as-a-messaging-tool.html) gay rights as a public-relations tool, funding Pride marches and branding itself as a gay-friendly country to hide the fact that many conservative and especially religious politicians being fiercely homophobic.
1.6.6.2. Con: Pinkwashing can be a good thing.
1.6.6.2.1. Pro: The support of well-established brands could help the image of the LGBTQ+ community in terms of gaining wider support.
1.6.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.6.6.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.6.6.3. Pro: For decades corporations refused to support LGBTQ+ groups out of fear of public backlash. It is immoral for these groups to now give support when they still do not properly help the movement.
1.6.6.4. Pro: It is relatively easy for [many](https://www.newsmax.com/fastfeatures/pride-parade/2015/06/08/id/649376/) [large](http://www.sfpride.org/sponsor/) [companies](https://www.nycpride.org/sponsors/) to sponsor Pride events once a year and seem progressive without advocating for any real legislative change to materially improve things for LGBTQ+ people.
1.6.6.4.1. Pro: It is [easy](https://theconversation.com/the-rise-of-pride-marketing-and-the-curse-of-pink-washing-30925) for large corporations to indulge in a bit of low-cost “pink washing” to soften the edges of reputational damage by distracting from their own controversies.
1.6.6.4.2. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.2.1.6.
1.6.6.4.3. Con: Sponsorship shows support and acceptance for the group being sponsored, which can actively help said group on a societal level.
1.6.7. Con: This is an argument against any form of altruism. Whenever any individual or group does something to help another group, they benefit to an extent because people look on them favorably \(i.e. how the company profits\).
1.6.7.1. Con: If companies and individuals truly cared about the cause and not advancing their reputations, they could donate anonymously.
1.6.7.1.1. Con: Even anonymous donations involve a greater benefit to the individual than the cost of the donation, even if the benefit is in the form of feeling magnanimous.
1.7. Pro: Corporate sponsorship makes pride less inclusive.
1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.1.1.
1.7.3. Pro: For LGBTQ+ people who have had to leave corporations due to harassment, it can be deeply upsetting, even traumatic, to go to pride and see the company that harassed you pretending to be an ally.
1.7.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.2.
1.7.3.2. Con: It is unlikely that the companies that engage in the harassment of LGBTQ+ individuals are the same companies who donate to Pride.
1.7.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.6.3.
1.7.3.2.2. Pro: Harassment can occur as a result of the actions of a few individuals, and therefore may not be reflective of the policy of the companies marketing and management.
1.7.3.2.3. Con: -> See 1.5.2.4.4.
1.7.3.2.4. Con: -> See 1.5.2.4.2.
1.7.3.2.5. Con: -> See 1.5.2.4.3.
1.7.4. Con: For employees working in corporations which sponsor pride, being able to see your employer be part of pride can be welcoming for you.
1.7.5. Con: Corporations being at odds with LGBTQ+ politics comes from the assumption that the LGBTQ+ community must be anti-capitalist. Whilst some LGBTQ+ people hold this view, many do not; corporate sponsorship of pride allows people who are pro-capitalism to feel welcome.
1.7.6. Con: Banning corporate sponsorship makes it harder for people who have just come out to engage with pride.
1.7.6.1. Pro: Coming out of the closet involves taking a big step to say that you are different to the social norm. When pride changes to being anti-corporation, you have to take another step against the social norm to say you are anti-corporation.
1.7.6.1.1. Pro: Pride rejecting corporate sponsorship will be big news, covered in the media. People will associate the LGBTQ+ community as being anti-corporate.
1.7.6.1.2. Pro: When the community is viewed to people who have yet to come out as not only about being LGBTQ+ but also about being anti-corporate they will view the community as even more different to them. It becomes harder for them to associate with the LGBTQ+ community when it seems even more different.
1.7.6.1.2.1. Pro: Pride is often the way a lot of people who have just come out explore their LGBTQ+ identity; making this harder for them means people are less likely to come out.
1.7.6.1.3. Con: LGBTQ+ individuals who have just come out need not be viewed as also anti-corporate. There are a wide variety of different groups at Pride with different political leanings \(e.g. radical anti-capitalist groups and groups from Conservative Political [Parties](https://www.lgbtconservatives.org.uk/)\) There would still be groups at pride who one could march alongside, whose views would not be anti-corporate so they would not be viewed as anti-corporate.
1.7.6.2. Pro: Corporate sponsorship increases the presence and visibility of the LGBTQ+ community which means family and friends are more likely to understand what being LGBTQ+ means.
1.7.6.2.1. Con: Corporate sponsorship is usually in the form of at the parade itself or short advertisements. This does not lead to people gaining any nuanced understanding of what it means to be LGBTQ+.
1.7.6.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.5.
1.7.7. Con: Financial support from Corporate sponsorship allows Pride to provide essential facilities, meet legal requirements and pay for insurance, amongst other things. Meeting these practical goals allows more people overall to be included in Pride festivals.
1.7.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.7.7.2. Con: -> See 1.4.5.
1.7.7.3. Pro: [Disabled](http://festival.pride.scot/accessiblity/) access facilities are often prohibitively expensive. Corporate sponsorship allows for their provision. As a result, disabled LGBTQ+ individuals, some of the most disadvantaged within the community, are included in Pride.
1.7.8. Pro: Commercialising pride has made it very expensive for groups to take part.
1.7.8.1. Pro: Sponsorship has driven up the cost of participating in Pride leading to it being [less inclusive](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/19/gay-people-muslim-heritage-pride-london-march).
1.7.8.1.1. Con: A significant part of the problem identified by the author is the secularization of Pride which appears to be unrelated to corporate sponsorship.
1.7.8.1.2. Pro: Corporate sponsorship has made spaces at Pride events more [expensive](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-lgbt-pride-festivals-have-become-increasingly-corporate-2017-06-23), shutting out underfunded groups.
1.7.8.1.2.1. Con: The response to this is not to remove corporate sponsorship, but instead to reserve a number of spaces for less well-funded groups.
1.7.8.1.2.2. Pro: This is particularly potent for the LGBTQ+ community, who are [more likely to be in poverty](http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/lgbt.aspx) than their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts.
1.7.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.1.2.
