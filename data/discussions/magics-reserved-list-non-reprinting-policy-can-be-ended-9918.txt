Discussion Title: Magic's Reserved List non-reprinting policy can be ended.

1. Magic's Reserved List non-reprinting policy can be ended.
1.1. The dual lands should be reprinted.
1.1.1. Pro: These lands exhibit such consistent demand that the price of originals would not be negatively affected.
1.1.1.1. Pro: If Legacy and Vintage were accessible to a new cohort of players, the demand for original editions would inevitably increase.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Wizards has demonstrated a clear grasp of how to calibrate print runs so as to mitigate, but not ruin, prices.
1.1.1.3. Con: The bland art and dicey design of the original duals would compare poorly with modern alternatives.
1.1.2. Pro: Legacy could be enjoyed by thousands of additional players.
1.1.2.1. Con: Its easy to access dual lands on Magic Online.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Magic Online may eventually become unsupported.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: Magic Online is not always able to express the awkward mechanics that are sometimes present in this format.
1.1.3. Con: The milestone of acquiring a dual land is a special feeling.
1.2. The entire Reserved List should be made available for reprinting.
1.2.1. Pro: One of the precious joys of Magic fandom is understanding how great many of the first cards ever designed were.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Recently, reprints from Alpha have been showing up in many sets, to the delight of players.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Giant Spider was in Amonkhet.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Air Elemental was in Ixalan!
1.2.2. Pro: Some cards are overpowered, but Wizards uses the Banned and Restricted List to manage the balance of gameplay.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Balance is important to keep players happy.
1.2.2.2. Pro: If Wizard allows overpowered cards there will be less costumers.
1.2.3. Con: A drop in card value would affect a wide swath of Magic's fans.
1.2.3.1. Pro: There are thousands of people who have patiently stored Magic cards in their attics for over twenty years.
1.2.3.2. Con: Realizing that these cards can stabilize in value would encourage these owners to circulate them back into the market.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Exchanging an old card for a new card shouldn't be overly discouraged.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: An infusion of additional collections into the market would revitalize the ranks of many editions that had gone out of stock.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: The relative values of various printings could become better understood by allowing the market to add new data points to price history.
1.2.4. Con: This policy would be financially detrimental to some of the game's most dedicated business partners.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Card shops that have carried Magic cards since the beginning have been through some major challenges due to weak design, overprinting, and occasional gaffes.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: The overprinting of Fallen Empires created a worthless glut at a time when sellers expected the boxes to appreciate steadily.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: The Mercadian Masques era was not compelling enough to maintain the strength of the player base.
1.2.4.1.3. Con: Those mistakes are what enabled Wizards to hone their design and production into a business moving cards by the billion.
1.2.4.2. Con: Businesses should make decisions independently, and reap their own consequences.  The qualms of some owners shouldn't hold back the entire community.
1.2.5. Con: There is widespread concern that the corporate attitude of the publishers could be short-sighted.
1.2.5.1. Pro: If reprints were conducted in a way that damaged the value of original editions, the energy collectors put into preserving cards could drastically diminish.
1.2.5.2. Con: Magic was actually designed to transcend "rich kid syndrome".  It could help players focus on the game if cards did not have collectable value.
1.2.6. Pro: Recent designs have been good enough to show up in eternal formats.  Promoting Legacy and Vintage could lead to some great new Magic theorycraft.
1.2.7. Pro: The Reserved List was created to protect Magic from collapsing.  We now know this will never happen.
1.2.7.1. Con: It can happen. Magic could collapse.
1.2.7.2. Pro: Tens of millions of players in dozens of the most powerful nations are uber-dedicated to the game.
1.2.8. Pro: Wizards is leaving a ton of its intellectual property out of its operation.
1.2.8.1. Pro: Cards like Time Walk and Ancestral Recall are very powerful, but omitting them from the balance of the game prevents the printing of other powerful designs.
1.2.8.1.1. Con: It is widely acknowledged that cards so powerful cannot be succinctly balanced.
1.2.8.1.1.1. Pro: Overpowered cards wind up beating every deck that does not use them.
1.2.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: They upset the balance that makes Magic a good game.
1.2.9. Pro: The price of Black Lotus is one of the things that made Magic famous.  Adding drama to the saga would help publicize the game again.
1.2.10. Pro: Ascribing untold value to original power cards discourages them from being used at all.
1.2.11. Pro: Frustration about prematurely liquidating original cards is a phenomenon that keeps many former players away from the game.
1.2.12. Pro: The ongoing drama around the Reserved List is not a benefit to the community.
1.2.13. Pro: The number of people who would be negatively impacted is smaller than the group that would welcome this change.
1.2.14. Pro: Prices which get too high encourage counterfeiting.
1.2.14.1. Pro: Counterfeit cards have become harder to discern.
1.2.15. Pro: Prices that are too high encourage theft.
1.3. A few cards from early expansions should be reprinted.
1.3.1. Pro: Almost all of the cards that have been valuable for a very long time are not from expansion sets.
1.3.1.1. Pro: The Power Nine and the dual lands would remain protected.
1.3.2. Pro: It is good when a card's value is proportional to both its gameplay value and its scarcity.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Most cards are only good in very special decks.  If a player wants to go to those lengths to make a card shine, they shouldn't be stopped by arbitrarily inflated prices.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: There are few remaining copies of many obscure cards, and placing them in decks subjects them to permanent damage.
1.3.3. Pro: This policy would cool off speculation which makes card values unpredictable.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Magic cards have a large secondary market which makes it pretty easy to find any card.  Sellers can stay in business because their knowledge of the game helps them pick cards to invest in.
1.3.3.2. Con: It's not actually difficult to predict that the price of unique, scarce printings will go up.
1.3.3.3. Con: An unclear reprint policy would increase the unpredictability of price for many hundreds of cards.
1.3.4. Con: This change could affect confidence in long-term card value almost as much as a wider reprint.
1.3.4.1. Pro: The [Power Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Nine) were printed only early in the game. Reprinting them would drastically lower their value.
1.3.5. Pro: The list already had revisions, where cards were taken out.
1.4. Additional cards should be added to the Reserved List.
1.4.1. Pro: There are many old designs for which there is no gameplay need for a reprint.
1.4.2. Pro: Motivated investors should be given a chance to bid for collectable editions.
1.4.3. Con: Lots of younger, less wealthy players would get upset.
1.4.4. Con: This policy would only affect the secondary market, for which Wizards has no direct responsibility.
1.4.5. Pro: Old cards are historical treasures that should be preserved.
1.4.6. Pro: The character of a card is impacted by whether it gets reprinted.
1.4.7. Pro: This policy would give Wizards another recurring event to publicize.
1.4.7.1. Pro: It would be possible to invest in cards that were anticipated to be listed.
1.4.7.1.1. Con: There are too many cards in the pool to create orderly market machinations.
1.4.7.1.2. Con: This policy would create an opportunity fr insiders to front-run the market.
1.4.7.1.2.1. Pro: Insider trading of collectables is not illegal.
1.4.7.1.2.2. Pro: This financal incentive would reward people loyal to the company.
1.4.7.1.2.2.1. Pro: Wizards could retain better talent per unit of salary by leveraging these IP assets.
