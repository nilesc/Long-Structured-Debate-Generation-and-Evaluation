1.3. Con: No, its dumb, the animals have nothing to do with the arguments
1.4. Con: NO, they should accept all food. All food is useful and the person who donate it shouldnt be a valid criteria.
1.4.1. Con: If the entity that donates the food is inhumane to animals, animal shelters would be hypocrites to accept.
1.5. Pro: Yes, because bullfighting money comes from the death of bulls and bulls dont have less rights then dogs or cats.
