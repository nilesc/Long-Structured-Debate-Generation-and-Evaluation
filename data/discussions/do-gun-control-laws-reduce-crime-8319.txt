Discussion Title: Do gun control laws reduce crime?

1. Stricter gun control laws will reduce crime.
1.1. Pro: Stricter gun acquisition requirements will prevent guns in the hands of some people.
1.1.1. Pro: Every gun purchase should require a background check. The fact that individuals can sell guns to one another without this is asinine.
1.1.1.1. Con: How would the government know if a person sells a privately owned gun to another person? The only way for the government to know would be annual inspections of every firearm in the country and comparing serial numbers to a master list. That would mean attempting a 100% gun registration of the 350 million or so guns in the US. That is logistically impossible.
1.1.2. Con: While true, this claim does not recognize that it will be primarily law abiding citizens who are limited in use. Criminals have illegal means for acquiring firearms, which by definition are not affected by laws.
1.2. Con: Strict gun laws also make it harder for law-abiding citizens to get guns for lawful purposes such as self-defense. With a gun, a person's size, gender, age and overall health are irrelevant when they have to defend themselves. In the US, many women chose a gun for self-defense for that very reason.
1.3. Con: Many crimes have no relationship to gun ownership and won't be affected.
1.4. Pro: Gun control laws improve firearm safety and prevent accidents.
1.4.1. Pro: General restriction of gun ownership prevents situations when police officers shoot civilians believing that they are armed and dangerous. [Such occurrences take place in the US.](https://theconversation.com/why-do-american-cops-kill-so-many-compared-to-european-cops-49696)
1.4.1.1. Con: Such restrictions also prevent law-abiding people from stopping crimes before the police arrive. [Such occurrences take place in the US.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WnV6mYu7TI)
1.4.2. Con: Firearm safety and use training promotes safe use and prevents accidents. Gun control laws only restrict ownership and access which has little to do with safety.
1.4.3. Con: There is no evidence that government intervention in controlling guns or their use is more effective than the government doing nothing.
1.4.4. Con: Gun control laws only restrict ownership and access which has little to do with safety.
1.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.4.5. Pro: Gun laws in California specifically prove that legislation has been effective over the past 20 years.
1.4.5.1. Con: California has some of the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation. It has enacted firearm laws in excess of 10 times the number in other states despite being higher in violent crime rate. [ucr.fbi.gov](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-4) The following stories are examples about California's "effective" gun control laws: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack) [www.foxnews.com](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/06/10/shooting-at-california-house-party-leaves-several-people-injured-officials-say.html) [abc3340.com](http://abc3340.com/news/nation-world/police-multiple-people-shot-at-southern-california-business) [www.cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/11/us/california-school-shots-fired/index.html) [abc7news.com](http://abc7news.com/lookback-the-deadly-school-shooting-that-launched-cas-ban-on-assault-weapons-/3396538/) [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101_California_Street_shooting)
1.5. Con: The fact that [a massive increase in guns in the US has happened at the same time as gun related crimes have dropped](https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2013/05/14/disarming-realities-as-gun-sales-soar-gun-crimes-plummet/#4ad0eca33f7c) seriously challenges the idea that gun control reduces crime.
1.6. Con: Unless it is a national level gun control law, people can always travel to an area of looser control, and get their firearms there. So unless there is a national gun restriction law, the results will not curb crime.
1.7. Pro: Countries with stronger gun control laws have generally lower rates of crime and violence.
1.7.1. Con: Perhaps the clearest example where gun control has little to no effect on crime is Brazil. Brazil never had widespread gun ownership, yet Brazil has a very high level of homicide and homicide with guns. Brazil's homicide rate is five to six times as great at that in the United States. The homicide rate was not reduced after Brazil made its restrictive gun laws even more restrictive.[bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-09/brazil-s-strict-gun-laws-haven-t-stopped-its-killers)
1.7.1.1. Con: Brazil started gun control in 2003. Before that, homicides rate used to grow up to 8% per year. After gun control, homicides stopped growing. [pragmatismopolitico.com.br](https://www.pragmatismopolitico.com.br/2018/08/brasil-antes-estatuto-do-desarmamento.html)
1.7.2. Pro: The UK's, a place with stricter gun laws, [crime rate](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/United-Kingdom/United-States/Crime), especially for murder, is lower per capita than the US.
1.7.2.1. Con: The number of murders in the UK is misleading since the UK and the US record homicides differently. The UK doesn't list it as a homicide until there is a conviction. If someone is stabbed 23 times and there isn't a conviction, it is simply listed as a death. This is an intentional policy decision to reduce the official murder rate. Please read Part 2, Para. 35 of this report from the House of Commons.[THE LINK BETWEEN GUNS AND CRIME THE USE AND MISUSE OF STATISTICS](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmhaff/95/95ap25.htm)
1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.4.5.1.
1.7.4. Con: According to the UN, El Salvador has the highest intentional homicide rate in the world at 82.84 per 100,000 people and the US has only 5.35 per 100,000. However, El Salvador has some of the most restrictive gun laws and the US has some of the most lax gun laws. Since this is true, it does not follow that restrictive gun laws reduce violent crime. [Global Study on Homicide](http://www.unodc.org/gsh/) [El Salvador Gun Laws](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/el-salvador)
1.7.4.1. Con: The Numbers provided do not match the links: Total gun deaths in [El Salvador 2013](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/el-salvador): 1,590 \(homicides listed at 1,578\). - This is actually a reduction over the last 14 years, and works out as a rate of 2013: 26.03 per 100,000. \(Gun data beyond this date unavailable\) Only if we look at Total Homicides would be higher: 2015: 6,656, 2014: 3,921, 2013: 2,164 which works out as 2015: 108.64 2014: 64.20, 2013: 26.03. This indicates another factor was at play from 2014 onwards.
1.7.4.1.1. Pro: Between 2012 and 2017 the number of Guns in circulation in El Salvador almost doubled, despite the Gun laws, from 450,000 to 737,000. However, registered firearms only went from approximately 215,000 to 344,587.
1.7.4.1.1.1. Con: This shows a massive influx of unregistered firearms despite gun control. This would be evidence that Gun Control does not reduce crime and violence and is ineffective.
1.7.4.1.2. Pro: El Salvador is wracked by [political turmoil](https://theconversation.com/how-el-salvador-became-the-murder-capital-of-the-world-64196), post-war issues and influxes of criminal gangs from the US.
1.7.5. Con: In Chicago, they have strict gun laws. They also have high crime rates. This illustrates the fact that guns are not the problem.
1.7.6. Pro: Many nations without gun control laws have [lower crime](https://crimeresearch.org/2014/03/comparing-murder-rates-across-countries/) and murder rates than the United States.
1.7.6.1. Con: In [London](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/725636/notting-hill-carnival-london-acid-attack-barricades-homes-shops), they have strict gun laws. They also have high crime rates. This illustrates the fact that guns are not the problem.
1.7.6.1.1. Pro: The crime rate is high enough that residents have taken to [building barricades around their homes](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/725636/notting-hill-carnival-london-acid-attack-barricades-homes-shops). This illustrates the fact that guns are not the problem.
1.7.6.1.2. Pro: Incidents involving stabbing are high enough that police have had to [install metal detectors at the carnival](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/725354/notting-hill-carnival-bank-holiday-metal-detector-knife-gun-stabbing-met-police-london).
1.7.6.1.3. Pro: [Dimitrious Gargasoulas drove a car into a crowd in Melbourne, killing 6 and wounding more than 30.](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/13/bourke-street-driver-dimitrious-gargasoulas-believes-he-is-messiah) This illustrates the fact that access to guns is not the problem.
1.7.6.2. Con: Anecdotal evidence is weak. Many countries have strong gun control laws and high crime rates and vice versa.
1.7.7. Con: -> See 1.5.
1.7.8. Con: Countries with strict gun control laws are still as dangerous and [crime ridden](http://www.gunfacts.info/gun-control-myths/guns-in-other-countries/) as those without.
1.7.8.1. Con: This depends upon whether gun control is actually enforced, rather than just existing in policy.
1.7.8.1.1. Con: Whether or not a law is enforced largely depends on whether or not it is actually enforceable. We have seen with both the [New York SAFE Act](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankminiter/2015/06/24/nearly-one-million-new-yorkers-didnt-register-their-assault-weapons/#43cd81a5702f) and the [Connecticut Gun Registry](http://insider.foxnews.com/2014/02/13/reports-connecticut-gun-owners-refusing-register-their-guns) where people simply refused to register their weapons. Nobody knows how many there are and it's impossible to know who owns them. So knowing if you have complete registration and findng those that refuse to register is logistically impossible.
1.7.9. Con: Correlation does not equal causation.
1.7.9.1. Con: You don't expect that lower crime rate causes more gun control, so in this case correlation is a good indicator of causation.
1.7.9.2. Pro: Correlation might be a coincidence. Or co-causation by a external fact. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation)
1.7.10. Con: Gun Control does not curb crime or violence, only the ability of law abiding citizens to defend themselves from crime and violence.
1.7.10.1. Pro: In Virginia, gun ownership is prevalent, but, compared to Chicago and London, our crime rates are low. This illustrates the fact that guns are not the problem.
1.7.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.
1.7.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.1.
1.7.10.4. Pro: [A man used an axe to injure 9 people on a train in Germany.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/several-injured-in-axe-attack-at-duesseldorf-train-station/2017/03/09/366557e8-0513-11e7-9d14-9724d48f5666_story.html) This illustrates the fact that access to guns is not the problem.
1.7.10.5. Pro: [In 2014 in Canada, a schizophrenic man went to a party, found a knife there, and stabbed five people to death. This illustrates the fact that access to guns is not the problem.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/05/23/canadas-matthew-de-grood-he-went-to-a-party-thought-he-was-surrounded-by-a-conspiracy-involving-werewolves-and-killed-5/)
1.7.10.6. Pro: [In Turku, Finland a man stabbed 10 people, killing two.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/world/europe/turku-finland-stabbing-attack.html)
1.8. Con: Gun control will not stop someone with the intent to harm.
1.8.1. Pro: UK for example is a place with high regulation of guns, yet the crime is especially high. Here is a [bbc report](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42815768)
1.8.1.1. Con: "High Crime rate" is a subjective measure. Overall Violent crime rates in the US, are still [higher](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/United-Kingdom/United-States/Crime). Though this may be questionable on a per capita basis, the crimes in the UK appear to be of less violent nature than those in the US.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Your own source refutes your claim. Per your source, the number of assault victims and rape victims is twice as high as the US. Murders in general are 18% higher than the US. Drug offences are 327 times higher than the US. Robbery victims are double the US number. Property crimes are 22% higher in the UK than the US.
1.8.2. Con: Gun control is a form of prevention, stopping some crimes before the opportunity to commit them occurs.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Just because you don't have the data about people who would commint a crime if they had the opportunity doesn't mean that every crime is inevitable.
1.8.2.2. Con: Just because a gun COULD be used to commit a crime, it doesn't mean it WILL be used to commit a crime. Let us assume that every one of the [1.25 million violent crimes in the US in 2016](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/violent-crime) was committed with a gun, even though that is a ridiculously generous assumption. Considering that there are [approximately 393 million guns](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/there-are-more-guns-than-people-in-the-united-states-according-to-a-new-study-of-global-firearm-ownership/?utm_term=.ea414d71429e) in the US, that means that 0.3% of all guns would have been used to commit a crime. So a minimum of 99.97% of guns that COULD be used for criminal activities, are not.
1.8.2.2.1. Con: Though in this argument stricter gun laws could reduce crime by up to 1.25 million incidents, or 0.3% of the total, so would indeed reduce crime.
1.8.2.2.1.1. Con: Of course, this over simplifies the issue, as we are talking about control laws, not a ban. There would still be firearms and thus there would still be crime and we cannot state with any level of fact or accuracy by how much, if at all, such controls would reduce the incidence of violent crime.
1.8.2.2.2. Pro: Of course, the assumption is false, because guns are not the only implement used in a violent crime. Some even have no extra implement. So the argument is over generous and the fraction or percentage would be significantly lower.
1.8.2.2.3. Pro: This of course only addresses violent crime, and does nothing for non-violent crimes, so would have a negligible impact on overall crime rates.
1.8.2.2.4. Con: However if guns COULDN'T be used to commit a crime, they WON'T be used to commit a crime. If these assumed 1.25 million crimes wouldn't happen, this would mean \(other things remaining equal\) that crime has decreased, which is exactly what the main claim states.
1.8.3. Con: Laws against rape will not stop someone intending to rape, but that does not mean rape should be legal.
1.8.3.1. Con: This is a non-sequitur. Legal philosophy constitutes law as a means to administrate justice, not crime prevention. Laws cannot be enforced until broken. Saying that laws don’t prevent crime is not Saying there should be no laws at all. Rape laws allow victims to pursue justice against their attacker after the incident.
1.8.4. Pro: Criminals do not obey law, so even if the availability of guns may be lower, the crimerates would not fall for the reason that other weapons can be used and the victim does not have a legal weapon to defend itself.
1.8.5. Pro: Gun control only affects the law abiding. A criminal by definition does not follow the rule of law.
1.8.5.1. Con: A criminal, by definition, is someone who did not follow the rule of law at some point. If, in this case, he doesn't abide by gun control laws and gets caught without committing a mass shooting then the change of law changed what the criminal could have done.
1.8.5.2. Con: This is essentially an argument against having laws. By this logic, speed limits would be unnecessary as people speed anyway.
1.8.5.2.1. Con: The difference is that people defend themselves with guns from criminals who have guns. When guns are banned, criminals still have guns but innocent law-abiding citizens do not, thus the innocent law-abiding citizens get the short end of the stick. The speed limit example is not a logical comparison.
1.8.5.2.2. Con: It IS an argument against, "...the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." Unless i'm mistaken - there is NO constitutional right guaranteeing and/or preventing the establishment of speed limits.
1.8.5.3. Con: Gun control laws apply to the seller of a guns as well as a criminal that may be intending to use it, depending on the law in question. If gun stores are unable to sell specific guns, criminals will be unable to buy them.
1.8.5.3.1. Con: "Gun Control" laws apply to [a number citizens and/or entities](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/who-can-have-a-gun/categories-of-prohibited-people/#federal), not only to 'sellers', for example persons not permitted to purchase and/or possess firearms. These are not sellers.
1.8.5.4. Con: Guns are long-lasting goods. Therefore, the more people buy them, more guns are in the streets, and they might end up in the hands of the wrong people.
1.8.6. Pro: Guns are not the only way to kill someone. Australia \(1996\) is a prime example of how gun bans don't stop criminals who intend on doing evil. While gun violence and deaths may have gone down, other forms of violence such as sexual assault and robbery saw a spiked increase.
1.8.6.1. Con: For this claim to be true, you'd have to prove that higher gun control causes more crimes commited with other means \(so that crime rate is constant\).
1.8.6.2. Con: Sexual assault and robbery, while serious crimes in their own right, don't leave a crowd of people dead. Also, one could argue that they are made easier by a perpetrator's easy access to guns, thus delivering an even stronger argument for stricter gun control. It's not like these kinds of crimes don't happen in the US.
1.8.6.3. Con: The idea that guns don’t kill people, people do, is a bit disingenuous. A lone assailant with a knife has significantly less chance of causing mass harm than a lone assailant with a semi or fully automatic weapon.
1.8.6.3.1. Con: A determined individual could theoretically create damage in other ways. As example cars have been used in other countries. The abundance of cars isn't the issue, the issue is that an individual decides to use said vehicle.
1.8.6.3.2. Pro: An abundance of firearms, with legal sales between private parties, enables the lone assailant to get firearms and commit mass shootings.
1.8.6.3.2.1. Con: An abundance of [vehicles allows a lone assailant to drive through crowds](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/france-truck-attack/injured-man-dies-three-weeks-after-france-truck-attack-bringing-n623231). An abundance of [pressure cookers](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ny-nj-bombings/rigged-pressure-cookers-have-long-history-among-bombers-worldwide-n650176) and [household chemicals](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-23/govt-releases-list-of-household-chemicals-used-for-terrorism/4708948) allows a lone assailant to blow up large gatherings. Those with the intention of killing others will find a way and there is no way to stop them all.
1.8.7. Pro: In [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Brazil), civilians must have a gun license to own a gun. In [America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state#Common_subjects_of_state_laws), in some cases you do not need a gun license to own a gun. In Brazil, it is generally illegal to carry a gun outside the home. In America, civilians can carry concealed guns, and in some cases openly. Yet, [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_murder_rate) can sometimes have a higher homicide [rate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate).
1.8.7.1. Con: This is a bad example as US and Brazil are in completely different socioeconomic condition. It is possible that in both countries increased gun gontrol might lead to lower crime rates.
1.8.8. Con: Gun control will make people rely more on the law enforcement.
1.8.8.1. Con: Law enforcement shows up AFTER a crime has been committed. This does not serve the person in need of assistance.
1.8.8.1.1. Con: In case of gun ownership control, this is case of prevention, which happens before the crime.
1.9. Con: The second amendment specifically states the right to bear arms shall not be infringed.
1.9.1. Con: The 2nd amendment is an amendment - therefore by definition it can be amended.
1.9.2. Con: The second amendment is irrelevant to the question if stricter gun control will reduce crime.
1.9.3. Con: The 2nd amendment stems from a time when 'arms' meant single-shot front-loaded muskets and flintlock pistols, and when there was no standing army or functioning law force, when people had to defend themselves against bandits and natives, and had to hunt in order to stay alive. It is outdated and needs amendment. By all means, have a small-caliber handgun for self-protection. But nobody needs a military-grade assault rifle in their home.
1.9.3.1. Con: At the time the 2nd Amendment was adopted, there was still a standing army, just not a big one.
1.9.3.1.1. Con: The standing army was merely a[battalion of artillery and a regiment at the Western Frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Army#Early_national_period_\(1783%E2%80%931812\)). If this can be labelled a standing army it is a marginal one.
1.9.3.1.1.1. Con: You have simply made my point. The standing army was not big.
1.9.3.2. Con: There is still a need to defend yourself from criminals and firearms are the most effective means. Of those firearms, [long guns are considered to be very effective by experts](https://www.personaldefenseworld.com/2017/06/home-defense-special-forces/).
1.9.3.3. Con: There are many instances of an [AR-15 or similar weapon being used to defend against multiple intruders in the home.](https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/03/14/8-times-law-abiding-citizens-saved-lives-ar-15/)
1.9.3.4. Con: Individuals are responsible for defending themselves and their property until help arrives, which can be a considerable amount of time.
1.9.3.4.1. Pro: A recent investigation into the response time of [Cleveland's police](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/investigations/news-5-investigation-reveals-slow-911-response-times-by-cleveland-police) to priority 1 and 2 emergencies is 17 minutes and 8 minutes to respond to a call about "shots fired"
1.9.3.4.2. Pro: Response time in [rural areas](https://www.jwatch.org/na44696/2017/08/04/ems-response-times-are-double-rural-vs-urban-areas) increases dramatically when compared to major cities.
1.9.4. Con: The right to bear arms stems from an Amendment to the Constitution. It clashes with the right to life, which is a foundational part of the Constitution and therefore overrides the rights conveyed by the Second Amendment
1.9.4.1. Con: A right is an inherent thing and is not granted or given by any person or government.The 2nd Amendment protects the individual's inherent right to use weapons to defend your inherent right to life.
1.9.4.2. Con: Right to bear arms does not stem from an amendment in U.S. Constitution. It originates from the [1774 Gunpowder Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Incident) which precipitated the American Revolution.
1.9.5. Pro: The word "keep" is as equally important as our ability to 'bear.' Absent our ability to "keep" arms - we might well be compelled to surrender and only bear as permitted by a government.
1.9.6. Pro: Constitutional rights exist to protect freedom first and foremost and should not be taken lightly.
1.9.6.1. Con: -> See 1.9.2.
1.10. Con: The police being armed shows how armed citizens can curb crime. EX. The number of police stations being robbed is very low.
1.10.1. Con: Police stations don't hold any value and therefore are not worth to rob.
1.10.2. Con: Police are empowered by the state to apply "Legitimate Violence". Citizens, armed or not, cannot apply police-like violence to defend themselves.
1.11. Con: Gun laws do not prevent violence: guns themselves do not hurt and kill; the people using them do.
1.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.5.
1.11.2. Pro: If the decision to kill or harm were never made in the first place, gun control would not be required at all.
1.11.3. Con: -> See 1.8.6.3.
1.11.4. Con: Guns are weapons. They are tools designed for a single purpose: To kill. They have no other use or function. To claim they do not kill is to ignore their very purpose.
1.11.4.1. Con: Guns can kill more than just humans. Hunting is a prime example. The person behind the gun controls the ultimate purpose of the gun.
1.11.4.2. Pro: Guns [original](http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/technique/gun-timeline/) and currently largest purpose is for killing. Since their inception they have been used primarily for warfare.
