Discussion Title: Is there a social media bias?

1. Social Media sites disproportionately target Conservative users.
1.1. Pro: Although Facebook has denied deliberately targeting Conservative users, they have admitted that such targeting does indeed exist, but by accident. Therefore it does occur.
1.2. Pro: Facebook has deliberately targeted Conservatives. For example, Facebook told two women their pro-Trump videos were "unsafe."[washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/04/10/facebook-accused-of-deeming-black-pro-trump-sisters-unsafe/?utm_term=.fed9fab57cc6)
1.3. Pro: Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, has admitted that mistakes were made with Conservative user accounts, such as Diamond and Silk. That is a veiled admission of guilt.,
1.3.1. Con: [Removing](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/diamond-and-silk-not-terrorism-zuckerberg-admits-error-handling-conservative-pages) radical pro-life content is a correct use of the platform's blocking features, as "disrespectful" content is prohibited under Facebook's ToS.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Conservative rhetoric against reproductive rights is [dangerous](https://newrepublic.com/article/124829/roots-pro-lifers-dangerous-rhetoric) and has been identified as the cause for mass shootings.
1.4. Pro: Youtube banned four Alex Jones videos. This is direct evidence of Youtube political bias.
1.4.1. Con: This assumes the videos were removed because of their political message and not other content violations. [fortune.com](http://fortune.com/2018/07/26/youtube-removes-videos-alex-jones-hate-speech/)
1.5. Pro: Social media sites are designed for social interaction between users. Therefore, they are inherently political and biased.

1.6.4. Pro: Trump's account is too valuable to Twitter to be banned. Since he is president, his tweets generate a tremendous amount of site usage and financial benefit for site.

1.12. Con: Conservative users are more likely to write hate speech and are therefore more often the target of friendly-use policies.

1.14.1. Con: Accusations are not the same as evidence. Conservatives have often suggested violence as a solution to this increased conflict between us. Conservatives that suggest violence should be banned as it violates the ToS of most platforms.
1.15. Pro: That Alex Jones was banned illustrates how social media sites target conservative users.
1.15.1. Pro: [Infowars has been banned permanently by Facebook, Apple and Google \(YouTube\) in few hours time.](https://www.rt.com/usa/435259-infowars-ban-twitter-reacts/)
1.15.2. Con: Youtube correctly banned several Alex Jones videos for inappropriate political attacks on people with Liberal and Socialist leanings.
1.15.2.1. Con: Correct banning is not an argument against the premise. It is a data point that might support a lack of bias, but only if statistically significant when compared to incorrect banning of conservatives.
1.15.3. Con: Alex Jones is no conservative.
1.15.3.1. Pro: Alex Jones spreads conspiracy theories.
