Discussion Title: Should heterosexual people not be allowed in gay bars?

1. Heterosexual people should not be allowed in gay bars.
1.1. Con: Denying entry on the basis of sexual orientation would be illegal and discriminatory.
1.1.1. Pro: A business’ right to refuse service has limitations and laws do not allow arbitrary refusal.
1.1.1.1. Pro: LGBTQ+ bars are privately owned businesses but they are also considered places of public accommodation. The primary purpose of a bar is providing entertainment to the general public, which necessarily requires susceptibility to equal protection laws. A place of public accommodation has the right to refuse service on the basis of conduct, but not on the basis of many kinds of identity, including race, sex, or religion.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Given that many straight people often behave inappropriately in queer spaces \([stereotyping gay men](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/stereotyping-gay-men-as-stylish-and-witty-prevents-people-seeing-them-as-proper-individuals-a6861296.html), [bisexual erasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexual_erasure) etc.\), these could easily be used as legitimate grounds to ask people to leave an LGBTQ+ space.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If some straight people behave inappropriately, ban those individuals from attending LGBTQ+ bars. It is not justified to ban all straight individuals because a minority of them misbehave.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Articles written by members of the LGBTQ+ community state that LGBTQ+ individuals also [misbehave](https://www.vice.com/sv/article/nn4xpz/gay-men-and-their-not-so-cute-misogyny-problem) and make others feel uncomfortable. It is wrong to single out straight individuals for criticism.
1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Even within the LGBTQ+ community, many gay women suffer from [misogyny](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/news/a62531/queer-women-lgbt-places/) in male-dominated gay spaces.
1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The fact that within the LGBTQ+ community there are issues to work on and solve, like misogyny and racism, does not negate the fact that LGBTQ+ people suffer from discrimination and need autonomous spaces.
1.1.2. Pro: Discrimination based on sexual orientation is illegal in many countries. This discrimination includes refusal to [provide a service](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Countries_and_territories_with_LGBT_anti-discrimination_laws_in_goods_and_services.svg) to anyone.
1.1.2.1. Pro: [The Canadian Human Rights Act](http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-discrimination-and-harassment-because-sexual-orientation/part-i-%E2%80%93-context-sexual-orientation-human-rights-protections-case-law-and-legislation) \(CHRA\) includes sexual orientation as a protected ground and guarantees the right to equality, equal opportunity, fair treatment and an environment free from discrimination in employment and the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation within federal jurisdiction.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Several European countries, including [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Finland#Discrimination_protections), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_France#Discrimination_protections), [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_Netherlands#Summary_table), [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Iceland#Discrimination_protections), [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Norway#Discrimination_protections_and_hate_crime_laws), [Slovenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Slovenia#Legal_protection) and [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Slovenia#Legal_protections), have anti-discrimination laws in the provision of goods and services based on sexual orientation.
1.1.2.3. Con: Discrimination laws on sexual orientation [vary](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/19/united-states-state-laws-threaten-lgbt-equality) from state to state in the US; therefore, gay bars would not be illegal in some states.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: The law in Mississippi that allows businesses to legally refuse service to gay couples does so on the basis of [moral or religious](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/659484/Mississippi-law-refuse-service-gay-couples) grounds, neither of which apply to services offered to only gay people.
1.1.2.4. Con: Minority groups have a right to ensure that their culture continues to exist. It is wrong, and misleading, to describe this behavior when practiced by the LGBTQ+ community as 'discrimination.'
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: There's a huge difference in discrimination by the majority vs. a minority wanting their own space. Discrimination is a form of social power and by definition, groups that lack social power cannot discriminate against groups that have social power. Setting up a safe space is an act of self-defense against discrimination, not discrimination itself.
1.1.2.4.1.1. Con: Claiming banning heterosexuals from gay bars is not an example of discrimination because discrimination is not defined this way is misleading, as the definition used is not yet agreed upon. [Most](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/discrimination) [objective](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/discrimination) [sources](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/discrimination) make no mention of the relative social power between groups, but agree discrimination occurs when treating an individual or group in a way because they are part of some group.
1.1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: It may still not be the same as it could be akin to [reverse discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_discrimination). The concept, applied to different laws and policies, is based on the idea that when minorities has been denied access and rights, unequal treatment of a majority is intended to remedy the past discrimination against minorities.
1.1.2.4.2. Con: If some groups have the right to ensure their culture continues to exist than all groups must have the right to ensure their cultures continue to exist.
1.1.2.5. Pro: Sexual orientation, like race and gender, is an illegitimate basis on which to deny somebody service, as it is a fundamental part of their identity.
1.1.2.6. Pro: In [Australia](https://www.business.gov.au/info/plan-and-start/start-your-business/what-is-customer-service/refusing-service), it is illegal to refuse service to someone based on their sexual orientation, including heterosexual individuals.
1.1.2.7. Pro: In Belfast \(Northern Ireland\) there is currently a case ongoing where a [bakery run by Christians refused to make a cake](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/man-at-centre-of-gay-cake-case-facing-heavy-burden-court-hears-1.3481814) bearing the slogan "Support Gay Marriage". Early court cases deemed the actions of the bakery to be illegal; the case has now been escalated to the Supreme Court of Belfast.
1.1.2.8. Pro: When providing goods, facilities and services, refusing to provide them to someone based on their sexual orientation is [illegal](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/discrimination-because-of-sex-or-sexual-orientation/discrimination-because-of-sexual-orientation/#h-sexual-orientation-when-providing-goods-facilities-and-services) in the UK. A bar that only caters to gay people would therefore be illegal.
1.1.2.9. Con: Discrimination based on sexual orientation does not extend to [access to goods and services](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2016/582031/EPRS_BRI\(2016\)582031_EN.pdf), which means there is room for gay only bars to exist in some European countries.
1.1.2.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.1.3. Con: LGBTQ+ bar owners should feel empowered to decide who they admit, so that they can take into account the specific needs of their customers and the community they serve.
1.1.3.1. Con: Being LBGTQ+ does not give you the right to discriminate against someone because of their sexual orientation.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Bars catering specifically to gay women are on the [decline](https://brooklynbased.com/2015/04/10/new-yorks-lesbian-bars-disappearing-survival-matters/). This often forces them to go to other gay bars on "[lesbian night](https://www.pride.com/need-know/2015/05/07/where-did-all-girls-go-disappearing-lesbian-bar-us)" to meet women, which would not be possible if the bar owners were forced to let in everyone.
1.1.3.3. Pro: If it is legal to deny service based on moral or religious grounds, or if it is legal to deny someone service based on personal moral grounds, then LGBTQ+ spaces should be free to use that, with the moral idea that a gay bar is meant for gay people, and straight people should not be there.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: It's [legal](https://theculturetrip.com/europe/united-kingdom/england/london/articles/london-s-10-most-exclusive-gentlemen-s-clubs/) to refuse women entry to a men's club and vice versa.
1.1.3.4. Pro: LGBT bars should be legally allowed to discriminate against whomever they like. However, other bars should also be allowed to discriminate against whomever they would like as well. Once these policies are communicated to their communities, their communities can decide whether or not to patronize these places or not.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: Bars don't have a right to know your sexuality.
1.1.3.4.2. Pro: Bars can refuse you entry based on you refusing to disclose your sexuality.
1.1.4. Pro: If gay bars are allowed to discriminate against heterosexual individuals, then this will embolden other private business owners to discriminate against the homosexual community on a much wider scale.
1.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.
1.1.4.2. Pro: The LGBTQ+ community is [already](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/04/politics/masterpiece-colorado-gay-marriage-cake-supreme-court/index.html) discriminated against, there is no need to provide those that would discriminate another reason to do so.
1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.1.6. Pro: Leave it to the market. Bars are commercial enterprises. Patrons of gay bars who do not wish to associate with straight customers are free to move on to other bars where straight customers are few in number or non-existent.
1.1.7. Con: Equity and equality are different things - [equality](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/equality) means treating everyone equally regardless of circumstance; [equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_theory) means treating everyone fairly after accounting for individual circumstance. While a ban on heterosexuals would be classed as discrimination when viewing all sexualities as equals, in full context a ban would provide equity by countering much larger systemic inequality against non-heterosexuals. Therefore a ban cannot be viewed as discriminatory in the bigger picture.
1.2. Pro: As long as LGBTQ+ sexuality and identity is not as commonly accepted as cis-gendered and heterosexuality, safe or autonomous spaces are needed.
1.2.1. Con: Gay culture was [built](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2017/12/12/boston-gay-scene/) on the tension between sexual self-expression and social repression; as that tension has eased, it’s no surprise that gay bars have shuttered.
1.2.2. Pro: LGBTQ+ bars should be spaces where individuals can meet and interact and foster and empower their community.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Unlike straight people, LGBTQ+ individuals in many cultures cannot openly express their sexuality in public. LGBTQ+ bars are one of the few places where displays of their sexuality do not face censure or harassment.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: The solution to this problem is to make society more accepting of LGBTQ+ individuals, not to continue their self-segregation in LGBTQ+ only spaces.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Both things can happen at the same time. The LGBTQ+ community should obviously aim to make society more accepting, but at the same time it is unreasonable to say that they should not have any safe spaces during the time it takes to make society more accepting.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Having at least one safe space to be themselves is the least society owes a community which has historically been so discriminated against.
1.2.2.2. Pro: There are certain important conversations which are difficult for LGBTQ+ individuals to have if straight people are present in the same space. These include, but are not limited to: sharing stories about coming out, discussing how to provide members of the community with support, and discussing shared experiences of homophobia.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: The solution is not necessarily to exclude straight people from the conversation. In fact, it may be important to expose heterosexual people to these topics to equip them with knowledge so they can provide support for LGBTQ+ individuals.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: LGBTQ+ people should not be forced to give up their spaces in order for heterosexual people to be equipped with knowledge.
1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: It should not be the burden of oppressed groups to educate those with more privilege.
1.2.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: We cannot expect heterosexual people to be able to learn about issues that they are unfamiliar with, and in particular have no lived experiences of. This type of information has to come from those with this knowledge- in this case, the LGBTQ+ community.
1.2.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Heterosexual people can then use this newfound knowledge to educate others, when appropriate.
1.2.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: There are plenty of online resources and published works on LGBTQ+ rights. Straight people who ask LGBTQ+ individuals to 'teach' them are making unfair demands on LGBTQ+ individuals time.
1.2.2.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Educating straight people can be emotionally exhausting and risks derailing important discussions. This is why many LGBTQ+ individuals prefer to have conversations within LGBTQ+ only spaces.
1.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: Not all LGBTQ+ individuals have access to the LGBTQ+ community. Thus, it is important that straight people are educated so that they can provide appropriate advice, and direct LGBTQ+ individuals to appropriate support networks.
1.2.2.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.1.1.
1.2.2.2.1.4. Con: Excluding heterosexual people from gay bars is not excluding them from all conversations; awareness can be created through multiple forums, not just gay bars.
1.2.2.2.1.5. Con: Individuals tend to go to bars to socialise and enjoy themselves, rather than to engage in meaningful and constructive dialogue about the various ways in which they may be discriminating against others. Gay bars are not the right place for such conversations.
1.2.2.2.1.5.1. Con: Many LGBT bars function as sites from which [protest and activism](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_gay_bar/2011/06/the_gay_bar_4.html?via=gdpr-consent) are organised. It is disingenuous to claim that 'gay bars are not the right place for such conversations.'
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: LGBTQ+ individuals often self-censor when talking about these topics in front of straight people.
1.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: This is because LGBT individuals sometimes fear 'offending' straight people when they discuss these issues in an open, direct and honest manner.
1.2.2.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.
1.2.2.2.3. Pro: Straight people who overhear these conversations, often feel the need to interject and hijack conversations by "[Straightsplaining](http://gawker.com/a-field-guide-to-straightsplaining-1516723100)."
1.2.2.3. Pro: Gay bars are a source of empowerment for LGBTQ+ people because there they are accepted not only despite their difference from the majority, but because of their difference. Gay bars provide LGBTQ+ people an opportunity to celebrate the positive aspects of their sexuality and allow them to celebrate their struggles and their achievements.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: It is not uncommon for minorities to feel that others might belittle their experiences as they have never seen life through the same lens. Gay bars provide an environment in which LGBTQ+ people can share thoughts, ideas and experiences with the knowledge that those listening understand their context.
1.2.2.4. Con: Bars are inherently exclusionary spaces. Using a bar as a platform to empower a community ensures that some people in that community won't be represented.
1.2.2.4.1. Pro: According to one [study](https://qz.com/1014142/a-teen-health-survey-crucial-to-us-public-policy-is-finally-asking-kids-about-their-sexual-orientation/), 8 percent of all high school students in America report being lesbian, gay, or bisexual. They are unable to participate in activism at LGBTQ+ bars because they are underage and cannot get in.
1.2.2.4.2. Con: Bars have a long [tradition](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/clint-lanier-and-derek-hembree/the-revolutionary-war-thr_b_5540519.html) of serving as meeting places for those conspiring to achieve social and political change.
1.2.2.4.3. Pro: LGBTQ+ individuals who struggle with alcohol abuse shouldn't have to meet in a bar in order to feel empowered.
1.2.2.4.3.1. Pro: [Studies](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/substance-use-suds-in-lgbt-populations) have found that LGBT individuals abuse alcohol at higher rates than heterosexual individuals.
1.2.2.4.3.2. Con: There are increasing numbers of "[queer cafes](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-gay-bar-is-dying-long-live-the-queer-cafe)" for LGBTQ+ individuals to meet without drinking.
1.2.2.4.3.2.1. Pro: Events like "[Queers Without Beers](https://www.buzzfeed.com/patrickstrudwick/this-is-what-its-like-inside-an-alcohol-free-gay-bar?utm_term=.we8mgk7Gp9#.vs02JKyRqM)" increasingly provide safe spaces for LGBTQ+ individuals without the expectation of having to drink alcohol.
1.2.2.4.4. Pro: Elderly LGBTQ+ individuals or families with children may not have the time, resources, or interest in going to a bar.
1.2.2.4.5. Con: Gay bars do not have to empower all members of the LGBTQ+ community; they are important as long as they empower some members of the community.
1.2.2.4.6. Con: This would only be a problem if gay bars were being championed as the only place for members of the LGBTQ+ community to meet; given it is just one of the places the community can meet, disempowerment is not a concern.
1.2.2.4.6.1. Pro: Many cities have their own [LGBT sports leagues](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/07/top-lgbt-sports-cities_n_3402454.html), [book stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LGBT_bookstores), and [film festivals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LGBT_film_festivals), in addition to many more LGBTQ+ friendly places to meet.
1.2.2.4.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.3.2.
1.2.3. Pro: LGBTQ+ spaces should guarantee that individuals can express themselves freely and without abuse or discrimination.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Many LGBTQ+ individuals still face discrimination, harassment, and violence in their daily lives.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Between 11 percent and 28 percent of LGB workers in USA report being denied or passed over for a promotion because of their sexual orientation, and 1 in 10 LGB workers who were out on the job report having been fired from a job in the previous five years because they were lesbian, gay or bisexual. \(Center for American Progress, [pg.10](https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2014/12/24121649/LGBT-WeThePeople-report1.pdf)\)
1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: As many as 47 percent of transgender people in USA report being fired, not hired, or denied a promotion because of their gender identity. Of the 47 percent of transgender people who have been discriminated against, roughly half report being fired from a job they already had simply because of their gender identity. \(Center for American Progress, [pg.11](https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2014/12/24121649/LGBT-WeThePeople-report1.pdf)\)
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: In a survey of LGBT middle and high school students conducted by the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network in 2013, three-quarters of LGBT students said they frequently heard the word “gay” used negatively at school, one-third of LGBT students reported physical harassment at school based on their sexual orientation, and 17 percent reported assault. Nearly 60 percent of LGBT students reported experiencing sexual harassment at school. \(Center for American Progress, [pg.43](https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2014/12/24121649/LGBT-WeThePeople-report1.pdf)\)
1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: LGB college students experience significantly higher rates of harassment \(23 percent\) than their non-LGB peers \(12 percent\). Rates are even higher for transgender individuals: 38 percent of feminine-presenting, 39 percent of masculine-presenting, and 31 percent of gender-nonconforming students report harassment, compared with 20 percent of non-transgender men and 19 percent of non-transgender women. \(Center for American Progress, [pg.52](https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2014/12/24121649/LGBT-WeThePeople-report1.pdf)\)
1.2.3.1.3. Pro: In the UK, hate crimes against LGBT individuals have [risen by 80%](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/gay-lgbt-hate-crimes-stats-rise-four-year-physical-verbal-homophobic-abuse-community-a7933126.html) in the past four years.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Straight people often tend to [behave badly](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/08/13/should_straight_women_go_to_gay_bars_a_drag_queen_reports_on_the_lady_invasion.html) in gay bars: they'll make uncomfortable pronouncements and personal comments; make jokes based on outmoded perceptions of queer life; and make a lot of tone-deaf noise that can entirely ruin the night for a room full of queer patrons.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: Making assumptions based on someone's sexual orientation is ultimately wrong no matter who you are judging. If someone is behaving badly in any pub they can be evicted, there is no reason to assume someone will behave badly due to their sexual orientation.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.2.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.2.
1.2.3.2.3. Pro: Straight men often treat lesbian bars as curiosities or [entertainment](https://mic.com/articles/105608/clueless-straight-people-review-gay-bars-totally-miss-the-point#.npXpqu1hW).
1.2.3.2.4. Pro: Straight men have been known to come to gay bars to [harass](https://www.autostraddle.com/lets-hash-it-out-how-do-you-feel-about-men-and-straight-people-going-to-lesbian-bars-267955/) women.
1.2.3.3. Con: Straight people who wish to attend LGBTQ+ clubs are unlikely to be hostile. This policy scares away potential allies.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.2.4. Pro: LGBTQ+ bars are important spaces to find potential partners.
1.2.4.1. Pro: "LGBTQ+ only" bars empower members of the community to pursue romantic relationships. This is because if a bar is "LGBTQ+ only," individuals know that it is unlikely that they will hear the response: "I'm not interested because I'm straight."
1.2.4.2. Con: More gay men [meet](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-brenner/dating-apps_b_2380898.html) through dating apps than at gay bars.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: [A survey](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-brenner/dating-apps_b_2380898.html) of 537 single gay and bisexual men shows that first generation dating apps are viewed as the most promising place to find a hookup. According to the men in the survey, prior to the advent of dating apps, bars held that title, but they are now a distant second.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: While initial contact may be made through dating apps, when they plan to meet each other in person they may require LGBT friendly areas.
1.2.4.2.2.1. Con: The [recent decline](https://www.ft.com/content/be9779b6-bfcb-11e7-823b-ed31693349d3) in gay bars due to the rising popularity of gay dating apps shows that most people go to gay bars for initial contact. The immediate access provided by gay dating apps means that people can meet at an agreed location away from a meeting in a bar or club.
1.2.4.2.3. Con: The majority and most popular of these dating apps are aimed primarily at gay men, thus [excluding](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/dating-while-non-binary) lesbians, non-binary and trans individuals. These people still heavily rely on LGBTQ+ spaces to meet people.
1.2.4.2.4. Con: Many older LBGTQ+ men and women may not be familiar enough with technology to avail of dating and socialising apps. These people should have spaces where they can meet like minded friends and partners.
1.2.4.2.5. Con: This does not mean people don't meet each other in gay bars at all. There's no reason why both options, that of bars and dating apps, should not be provided to the LGBTQ+ community.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Straight people have the luxury of being able to safely assume everyone around them is straight unless someone indicates otherwise. A gay bar is often the only place in which LGBTQ+ people have the same luxury. Straight people in gay bars therefore make it harder for LGBTQ+ people to find potential partners.
1.2.5. Pro: Many countries not only prohibit LGBTQ+ spaces, but actively [persecute](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/mar/01/where-are-the-most-difficult-places-in-the-world-to-be-gay-or-transgender-lgbt) citizens who identify as LGBTQ+.
1.2.5.1. Pro: According to one [study](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2014/02/global-map-homophobia/8309/), people in most of the world's largest countries said that their cities and areas were not good places for gays and lesbians to live.
1.3. Pro: LGBTQ+ spaces are considerably fewer than heterosexual ones and are declining; preserving the remaining ones is incredibly important for the community.
1.3.1. Con: Only [3-4 percent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_United_States) of the population of the US identifies as gay or lesbian. The small number of LGBT spaces relative to heterosexual spaces reflects this.
1.3.2. Con: Even America's most conservative states have [spaces](https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/most-gay-friendly-city-in-every-red-state-in-america) and events exclusively for the LGBTQ+ community.
1.3.3. Con: One of the main reasons gay bars are decreasing is because of the [increased acceptance](https://medium.economist.com/gay-bars-are-under-threat-but-not-from-the-obvious-attackers-797fb935e419) of homosexuality. As society has become more tolerating, many gay men and women, particularly youngsters, do not feel the need to congregate in one spot.
1.3.3.1. Pro: According to [research](https://medium.economist.com/gay-bars-are-under-threat-but-not-from-the-obvious-attackers-797fb935e419) by Amy Spring, a sociologist at Georgia State University, who looked at 100 American towns between 2000 and 2010, the vast majority of gay men \(87%\) and lesbians \(93%\) living with partners now live in neighbourhoods where gay and straight people increasingly live side by side. This indicates that there is less need for gay only spaces.
1.3.3.2. Con: Gay bars should exist not just because they are needed by the gay community, but also because they are wanted; to say that the gay community no longer needs safe spaces misses the point that the community can simply want a safe space where they can congregate and interact with those who share similar experiences.
1.3.4. Pro: Many [major cities](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jen-jack-gieseking/on-the-closing-of-the-las_b_6057122.html) have only one lesbian bar.
1.3.5. Pro: Heterosexual and cisgender people have ample places to safely socialize, meet one another, and feel comfortable expressing their true selves. For LGBTQ+ people, their circles are very, very limited, so when these spaces are infiltrated, it can feel like their identities are being [removed](https://www.bustle.com/articles/143343-3-reasons-we-still-need-lgbtq-safe-spaces-why-its-important-to-respect-them) as their community is being co-opted.
1.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.6.1.
1.3.5.2. Pro: LGBTQ+ individuals from [states](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/25/opinion/sunday/worst-and-best-places-to-be-gay.html) with anti-gay laws or a less accepting culture have a greater need for places to socialize, as they are unable to interact with each other as freely as heterosexual individuals.
1.3.6. Pro: Gay only bars are increasingly economically unsustainable, and are therefore declining in number.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Historically, gay bars had to be discreet, so they [sprung up](https://medium.economist.com/gay-bars-are-under-threat-but-not-from-the-obvious-attackers-797fb935e419) in scruffier parts of cities. As cities become wealthier, and as pressure on space intensifies, they are squeezed out once rent rises.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: Discretion used to be necessary as the [last thing](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_gay_bar/2011/06/the_gay_bar_3.html) closeted gay men and lesbians wanted was for co-workers, family members, or potential blackmailers to wander into their sanctuary - nor did they want to be seen coming and going from such establishments.
1.3.6.1.2. Pro: In order to [minimise](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_gay_bar/2011/06/the_gay_bar_3.html) harassment and complaints, gay bars had to historically open up in places which weren't that elite. Those same places are now developing and pushing out these bars.
1.3.6.2. Pro: Gay bars cater to a much [smaller](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_gay_bar/2011/06/the_gay_bar_3.html) consumer base than a normal bar, and if bars are 'gay only' or 'lesbian only', then they cater to one half of an already small group of people. This limits available profits.
1.3.7. Pro: Even online LGBTQ+ safe spaces are being taken over by heterosexual people. More and more straight people are now using Grindr, a hook-up app designed for guys who are into guys, [to make friends](https://mic.com/articles/134831/straight-people-are-going-on-grindr-to-make-gay-best-friends#.xHesf2epd).
1.4. Pro: When LGBTQ+ spaces become popular among straight clientele, they often stop being gay spaces.
1.4.1. Pro: Drag queens and gay men complain that straight women too often [crash](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2017/12/12/boston-gay-scene/) LGBTQ+ scenes in ways that center around themselves, acting like cultural tourists who don’t learn the local language and customs. This drives away members of the LGBTQ+ community from gay bars.
1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.4.3. Con: At a time when LGBTQ+ spaces are declining due to [economic factors and changes in hook-up culture](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/24/fashion/how-gay-should-a-gay-bar-be.html), the patronage of straight people can help to preserve these spaces.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Around 15 LGBTQ+ bars per year [close](http://www.sfweekly.com/culture/sex/do-straight-people-take-over-gay-bars/) in the USA. And many of those that remain open, are barely breaking even.
1.4.3.2. Con: If LGBTQ+ spaces are preserved by stopping being queer or de-queering, their benefits for the community are lost anyway.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: Many gay bars also have historical significance and [any way of preserving](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_gay_bar/2011/06/10-gay-bars-that-changed-history.html?via=gdpr-consent) these spaces is better than none.
1.4.4. Pro: Straight people may not be welcomed in LGBTQ+ spaces by all queer people.
1.4.4.1. Con: The solution may also be to educate members of the LGBTQ+ community to call out examples of prejudiced behavior exhibited by LGBTQ+ towards straight people.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Not wanting to share a space with those who benefit from your discrimination or who actually discriminate you or even put you in harms' way is not being prejudiced, it is a coping strategy.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: It is not the prejudice of LGBTQ+ people that prevents them from accepting straight people in their spaces, but the behaviour of straight people themselves.
1.4.4.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.4.4.2. Pro: LGBTQ+ people experience [systemic discrimination](https://egale.ca/history-of-discrimination-against-gays-and-lesbians/) on a daily basis, on many levels, and in ways that straight people may never encounter. The whole point of these safe spaces is to remove that power dynamic and this is partly what makes them spaces for healing. LGBTQ+ people therefore may want to have a safe space they don't have to share with the group that carries out and benefits from their discrimination.
1.4.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.4.4.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.
1.4.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.3.
1.5. Con: Enforcing rules like this would mean to assume one’s sexual orientation or identity, which could bring more harmful consequences than the alleged benefits.
1.5.1. Pro: [Studies](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5497267/No-one-100-straight-Study-says-sexuality-spectrum.html) have found that no-one is entirely straight. Sexuality exists on a spectrum and so LGBTQ+ spaces serve a purpose for the wide majority of people at some time or other.
1.5.2. Pro: It is impossible to ascertain the sexual orientation of every person entering a bar.
1.5.2.1. Pro: This could be especially problematic for trans and non-binary individuals as in order to judge their sexual orientation one would have to assume their gender.
1.5.3. Pro: The Bi community already feel [erased](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-establishment/bisexual-invisibility-the_b_9177988.html) in the LGBTQ+ community and the enforcement of these rules would only make that worse. Due to the fact that they may not always be in traditional LGBTQ+ relationship they could very easily be misjudged as straight despite being a part of the LGBTQ+ community.
1.5.4. Pro: It is important that queer people who are not out be allowed to interact with their culture \(albeit in a more discreet way\).
1.5.4.1. Pro: This is important as they are likely to find support amongst the LGBTQ+ community as many of them will have shared experiences, which may eventually enable them to feel comfortable to come out.
1.5.5. Pro: Many ['straightpassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_\(sociology\)#Sexuality_and_gender)' individuals \(those whose perceived sexual orientation or sexuality differs the one they identify with\) may feel under pressure to justify why they should be allowed within an LGBTQ+ space.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Many bi or trans people can have heterosexual partners.
1.5.5.2. Pro: Asexuals or demisexuals may feel excluded from LGBTQ+ spaces.
1.5.5.2.1. Con: Some LGBTQ+ community members feel it is not appropriate for people on the asexual spectrum to share a queer space, particularly if they identify as heterosexual, as they frequently have no lived experience of discrimination.
1.5.5.3. Pro: Transgender or intersex individuals may feel uncomfortable or feel the need to justify themselves.
1.5.5.4. Pro: Some LGBTQ+ people who appear straight/cis could be incorrectly turned away from gay bars. It would be almost impossible to correctly enforce the ban at all times.
1.6. Con: In many cases, straight women find safe spaces in LGBTQ+ bars.
1.6.1. Pro: Between 2011 and 2016, there was a [136% increase](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/pg773n/reports-of-rape-are-surging-at-bars-and-clubs-how-do-we-respond) in reported rapes in London bars and clubs.
1.6.2. Pro: Approximately [one-half](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh25-1/43-51.htm) of all sexual assaults are committed by men who have been drinking alcohol, with most of these assaults occurring at parties or bars.
1.6.3. Pro: [Studies](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/obsonline/women-warm-up-faster-to-gay-men-than-straight-guys-study-suggests.html) have shown that women feel more at ease and comfortable around men who identify as LGBT rather than straight.
1.6.4. Con: It is the height of structural privilege for straight people to feel entitled to the safe spaces of LGBTQ+ people which are created to protect them from a heteronormative and cisnormative world.
1.6.5. Con: This is not a solution to rape culture and women feeling unsafe in more mainstream spaces - in fact it just masks the problem of [rape culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture) further and prevents us addressing it.
1.6.6. Con: Straight women do not belong in LGBTQ+ spaces because they can never understand the suffering of queer people as they have not had the same lived experiences.
1.6.6.1. Pro: Heterosexual women come to gay bars as the empowered majority. Majority groups exercising entitlement to the safe spaces of marginalized groups is tone-deaf at best and oppressive at worst.
1.6.6.2. Con: Straight women and LGBTQ+ individuals should emphasize their commonalities. They should not focus on their differences. Both groups experience discrimination from patriarchal structures. Both groups would benefit from providing each other with support.
1.6.7. Con: Many gay men feel that straight women [stereotype and objectify](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/24/fashion/how-gay-should-a-gay-bar-be.html) them, hence making them feel uncomfortable.
1.6.8. Con: If straight women require safe spaces, they should create their own. This is preferable to straight women preventing LGBTQ+ individuals from having their own safe spaces.
1.6.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.6.1.
1.6.9. Pro: -> See 1.6.6.2.
1.7. Con: As LGBTQ+ rights advance, gay bars should be more inclusive.
1.7.1. Con: The primary role of LGBTQ+ bars is to provide an inclusive space for members of the LGBTQ+ community. LGBTQ+ bars do not have any obligation to be inclusive towards the straight community.
1.7.2. Pro: It is hypocritical for the LGBTQ+ movement to claim to be inclusive whilst being exclusionary towards straight people.
1.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.7.2.2. Con: Having some gay only bars is not the same as the entire movement alienating straight people. The movement can still very much be inclusive, but decide to have some safe spaces for itself at the same time.
1.7.3. Con: There is no guarantee that LGBTQ+ rights will advance, rather than regress in the future. Therefore it is important that LGBTQ+ bars are maintained.
1.7.4. Con: Discriminating or distinguishing people based on their sexuality would be the opposite of what LGBTQ+ fight and stands for.
1.7.5. Con: If LGBTQ+ bars are "inclusive" to straight people, in practice this will mean they will exclude many LGBTQ+ individuals, who will no longer feel able to attend.
1.7.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.
1.7.6. Con: -> See 1.4.4.
1.8. Con: Segregating and creating exclusive spaces is not an effective path towards acceptance.
1.8.1. Pro: Segregation like this is counter-intuitive to the current LGBTQ+ community's efforts to better integrate and be accepted by the straight community.
1.8.1.1. Pro: The LGBTQ+ community actively making an effort to sequester itself from the rest of society would result in less societal acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Creating private gay-only bars will increase cries of conspiracy amongst those already predisposed against homosexuality.
1.8.2. Pro: Many heterosexual people are outspoken [allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_ally) of the gay community, who can [benefit](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/karenhigginbottom/2013/12/23/how-straight-ally-programs-are-transforming-the-workplace/&refURL=https://www.google.ie/&referrer=https://www.google.ie/) the LGBTQ+ community with their support.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Allowing straight individuals to attend LGBTQ+ bars can help combat prejudice within society through the formation of friendships between groups.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Many straight individuals are influential and powerful. When LGBTQ+ bars promote interactions between straight and LGBTQ+ individuals, they help create opportunities for the LGBTQ+ community to gain access to important social networks that enable career advancement.
1.8.2.3. Pro: Straight allies and LGBTQ+ people do not belong to separate groups. Allies are an important part of many LGBTQ+ people's lives. They hang out together, not segregated. Exclusion of straight allies would surely be the downfall of any popular LGBTQ+ Establishment.
1.8.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.
1.8.2.4. Con: It is legitimate to be a heterosexual supporter of the LGBTQ+ movement, while also recognizing the benefits of a safe and exclusive space for homosexuals to meet and socialize.
1.8.2.5. Con: Support from heterosexual allies does not need to be limited to gay bars; not coming to one venue where members of the LGBTQ+ community meet each other does not prevent someone from being an ally of the community.
1.8.2.6. Pro: Allies can play an important role in [supporting](https://www.ft.com/content/6eef8a22-8efa-11e7-9580-c651950d3672) LBGTQ+ issues in everyday life.
1.8.2.7. Con: Some heterosexual women only befriend gay men to fulfill the "[Gay Best Friend](http://dailyutahchronicle.com/2015/10/14/gay-best-friend-stereotype-needs-to-stop/)" stereotype.
1.8.2.7.1. Pro: Many gay men [resent](https://www.elitedaily.com/life/culture/im-gay-not-your-accessory/962576) the superficial friendships of heterosexual women.
1.8.3. Pro: If heterosexual people cannot enter gay bars, then LGBTQ+ people should not be allowed into heterosexual bars; discriminating against one sexual orientation while over-promoting the other is not equality.
1.8.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.
1.8.4. Pro: Many heterosexual and LGBTQ+ individuals are friends or are in the same social circles. Enforcing this rule may make socialising more difficult for them.
1.8.4.1. Pro: The Peel, a gay nightclub which has legally been granted the right to refuse entry to heterosexual patrons, has angered gay patrons as they feel that the actions of the club are discriminatory towards their [straight](https://www.mamamia.com.au/the-peel-sexist-door-policy/) and homosexual female friends.
1.8.4.1.1. Pro: There is a facebook page with 715 likes called "[End the sexist door policy at the Peel](https://www.facebook.com/End-the-sexist-door-policy-at-the-Peel-333892389981325/)" which aims to stop the door policy in this club.
1.8.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.1.
1.8.4.3. Con: When they want to socialise in these groups, they can visit any other bar that is not gay only.
1.8.4.3.1. Con: Openly gay couples may not feel safe being themselves in certain locations.
1.8.4.3.1.1. Con: This isn't a challenge to socialising as long as there are some locations they can feel safe in that they can visit.
1.8.5. Pro: This has the potential to encourage an [us and them mentality.](http://www.theemotionmachine.com/the-us-vs-them-mentality-how-group-thinking-can-irrationally-divide-us/)
1.8.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.
1.8.6. Pro: Denying people's rights based on their sexual identity or orientation is why LGBTQ+ people needed safe spaces in the first place, banning heterosexual people would defeat the purpose.
1.8.6.1. Pro: It would only cleave the society more and strengthen the borders between communities, bringing more rejection and resentment in an already tense society.
1.8.7. Pro: This would force those gay bars that are somewhat undercover \(perhaps because they are in societies that have highly repressive attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community\) to go into the open, possibly creating reprisal by the law or the community much sooner than if it was allowed to operate more discreetly.
1.8.8. Con: Self segregation is a way LGBTQ+ individuals can ensure they are [safe](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/gay-lgbt-hate-crimes-stats-rise-four-year-physical-verbal-homophobic-abuse-community-a7933126.html). It is wrong to expect LGBTQ+ individuals to place their safety at risk.
1.8.8.1. Con: Regrettably, 'self segregation' can make it easier for extremists to specifically target the LGBTQ+ community. LGBTQ+ bars are sometimes subjected to violent [attacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/us/a-brief-history-of-attacks-at-gay-and-lesbian-bars.html).
1.8.9. Con: LGBTQ+ individuals regularly interact with straight individuals in schools, places of work and in other social venues. It is a huge exaggeration to claim that the existence of a few LGBTQ+ only bars is equivalent to the LGBTQ+ community self segregating.
1.8.9.1. Con: In [schools and work](https://jger.anahei.org/wp-content/uploads/01-01-04-Hiding-or-Out-Lesbian-and-Gay-Educators-Reveal-Their-Experiences-About-Their-Sexual-Identities-in-Their-K-12-Schools-JGER.pdf) many gay people may not be comfortable discussing their sexuality freely, resulting in straight people being unaware of LGBTQ+ issues and how to interact appropriately with them.
1.8.9.1.1. Pro: LGBTQ+ students are less likely than other students to feel comfortable in their classroom, department, and overall [campus](https://www.asccc.org/content/perceptions-campus-climate-and-engagement-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-community). \(Center for American Progress, [pg.52](https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2014/12/24121649/LGBT-WeThePeople-report1.pdf)\)
1.8.10. Pro: If LGBTQ+ bars became LGBTQ+ only, some members of the community would be excluded.
1.8.10.1. Pro: Individuals who are in the process of coming out, and who may be unsure about their sexuality, will feel less welcome.
1.8.10.2. Pro: LGBTQ+ individuals who are not socially out may be forced to justify why they attend LGBTQ+ bars, whereas if the spaces are for everyone, they can feel welcomed and safe.
1.8.10.2.1. Con: The [LGBTQ+](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/05/23/civilities-what-does-the-acronym-lgbtq-stand-for/?utm_term=.949744dd2eeb) community can also include those '[questioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questioning_\(sexuality_and_gender\))' and therefore those in the process of coming out or unsure would also be welcomed.
1.8.10.2.2. Pro: This includes both justifying to the bar staff, and justifying to friends/family. Being able to experience the community will help people decide who are not ready to out themselves yet.
1.8.10.2.3. Pro: If heterosexual people are not allowed within gay bars, then every person entering a gay bar must be LGBT, meaning that closeted LGBT people who are in highly anti-LGBT families cannot feign ignorance or curiosity if found out.
