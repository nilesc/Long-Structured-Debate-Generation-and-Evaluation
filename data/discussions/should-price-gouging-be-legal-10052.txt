Discussion Title: Should price gouging be legal?

1. Price gouging should be legal.
1.1. Pro: It is unethical to deny people the opportunity to freely buy and sell among themselves, of their own free will.
1.2. Pro: Price gouging discourages people from hoarding goods.
1.2.1. Pro: Without price increases, people may purchase goods 'just in case', meaning supplies could run out for those who really need the goods.
1.3. Con: In a natural disaster, the price-gouger is often a monopolist, which is not beneficial for consumers.
1.3.1. Con: There is no evidence this is the case, nor any reason to think that monopoly providers would be more prevalent during a natural disaster than at any other time.
1.4. Pro: Price gouging incentivizes suppliers to produce more goods in times of need.
1.4.1. Con: Corporate altruism is on the rise so many of they do need the extra "incentive".
1.4.2. Con: Increasing the prices of goods won't necessarily incentivize suppliers to bring in extra goods. However, it will benefit people who have a few extra cases of water stored in the back of their stores.
1.4.3. Con: Suppliers benefit from the shortage of goods - that is how prices can be gouged - so there is no incentive to increase supply in the short-term.
1.5. Pro: Government interventions to the free market are usually counter-productive.
1.6. Con: Price gouging is unfair on the poor.
1.6.1. Pro: Invariably, it is the rich who will be able to afford exorbitant prices for basic needs and the poor who will have to go without.
1.7. Con: It is unethical to take advantage of people who have gone through natural disasters.
