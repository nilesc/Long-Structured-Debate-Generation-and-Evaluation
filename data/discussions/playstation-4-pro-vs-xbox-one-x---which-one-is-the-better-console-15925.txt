Discussion Title: PlayStation 4 Pro vs. Xbox One X - which one is the better console?

1. The PlayStation 4 Pro is better than the Xbox One X.
1.1. Pro: The PS4 Pro has a wider collection of exclusive games.
1.1.1. Con: Yet the Xbox One X is stronger in some genres, for example racing games with exclusives such as the Forza Horizon and Forza Motorsport series.
1.2. Con: The Xbox One X has a 4K Blu-ray drive, which the PS4 Pro lacks.
1.2.1. Con: More and more people do not buy physical movies anymore but rather stream or download them. For many players this will therefore be of little use.
1.3. Con: The Xbox One X offers [unlimited cloud storage](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/xbox-one-x-vs-ps4-pro,review-4436.html).
1.3.1. Con: Most players will hardly utilize this space. It is therefore not relevant for them.
1.4. Pro: The PS4 Pro is cheaper by about $100.
1.4.1. Pro: XBOX One X has a higher resolution for most games.[ign.com](http://www.ign.com/wikis/xbox-one/PS4_Pro_vs._Xbox_One_X_Enhanced_Resolutions)
1.4.1.1. Con: For most users, and especially those with screen that cannot fully utilize these resolutions, the difference is neglectable.
1.4.1.2. Con: Most users probably watch movies and series via Netflix and other streaming services and hardly care about Blu-Ray.
1.5. Con: The Xbox One X has more powerful hardware to manage high-res games. Its CPU and GPU are [more powerful](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/xbox-one-x-vs-ps4-pro,review-4436.html) than the PS4 Pro
1.5.1. Pro: The Xbox One X thereby offers hardware [comparable to a standard gaming PC](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3235948/gaming/xbox-one-x-review-a-surprising-amount-of-power-in-a-very-small-box.html) for a significantly lower price.
1.5.2. Con: It is questionable whether users actually care about powerful hardware as an end in itself. If that would be the case, the success of the Nintendo Switch would be hard to explain.
1.5.2.1. Con: This depends on the type of games that users plan to play.
1.6. Pro: The PS4 Pro provides VR capabilities through the $399 Playstation VR headset. No such option exists on the Xbox One X.
1.7. Pro: The PS4 Pro makes it easier to share your game footage, photos and streams across more platforms.
