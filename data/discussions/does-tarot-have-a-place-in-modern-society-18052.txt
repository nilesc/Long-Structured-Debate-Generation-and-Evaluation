Discussion Title: Does Tarot Have A Place in Modern Society?

1. Tarot has a place in today's society
1.1. Con: Tarot is based on Occult practices, which many religions consider evil, because they prey on people's weaknesses and involve divination[Exploration of origins of Tarot as an Occult practice](https://www.biddytarot.com/is-tarot-evil/)
1.1.1. Con: Tarot practice is well known and very open, so cannot reasonably claimed to be occult \(which means hidden\) anymore.
1.1.2. Pro: Tarot can be easily used by scammers in order to [take money](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/12/new-york-psychic-arrested-zoe-fortune-teller) from people who believe in their supernatural abilities.
1.1.3. Con: Many religions believe that many practices are bad. This does not negate their place in society.
1.1.4. Con: Tarot continues to evolve, so it shouldn't be cut out because it has historical ties to Occultism.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Many modern readers disavow [superstition](http://www.lizworth.com/how-to-keep-tarot-relevant-in-a-modern-world/) and stereotypes of the past. Tarot is evolving to fit into the modern world.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Tarot has, in some ways, pushed feminist ideals beyond the mainstream norm.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: In the late 1800's, when women were still excluded from philosophy, science and education, they played an instrumental role in societies such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Their pivotal position allowed more authority and respect than many other institutions of the time. [Christof p. 157](http://www.larosadiparacelso.com/index.php/rosa/article/view/25/22)
1.2. Con: Tarot readers exploit the vulnerability of their clients.
1.2.1. Con: Opponents of the Tarot may argue that it tells people lies that may harm their lives. But the same is true for politicians. Politicians are allowed to spread their lies, and it is up to the people to do research and be skeptical about those lies. Neither Tarot nor politicians should be restricted.
1.2.2. Pro: Anything open to abuse should have some kind of governmental control, and Tarot is open to abuse as people are likely to consult readers when they need help.
1.2.2.1. Con: Restricting something because it has detractors has consequences for both free speech and freedom of beliefs.
1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.2.4. Con: If a clear abuse has taken place \(e.g. making false claims that something will definitely take place and it doesn't or coercing someone to do something for the purposes of fraud\), then there are laws in place to protect against this .[eg in UK there have been various laws throughout the years such as the Fraudulent Mediums act which continue to be refined](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/06/eu)
1.2.5. Con: Saying that a practice should be stopped because there is the possibility of abuse is an overreaction, and unfairly penalizes those who do not seek to abuse the relationship between reader and querent.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Tarot is not itself abusive. In many instances it provides supports, guidance and comfort to individuals.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Activities where one explores your spirituality, like Tarot, have been [linked](https://backpackerverse.com/tarot-mental-health-spirituality/) to wellbeing and personal happiness.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: It should be up to individuals to decide whether Tarot provides them help. Since many do, it is wrong to demonise Tarot.
1.2.6. Con: Manipulation of people in vulnerable situations can happen in many situations - Teachers, Doctors, Therapists, Law enforcement etc.
1.2.7. Pro: It is not acceptable to exploit people, therefore there should be regulation around Tarot readings - e.g. a professional organization with a code of conduct etc.
1.3. Pro: Modern society should embrace diversity, so it should embrace things like Tarot too.
1.3.1. Pro: Tarot forces you to think through your problems in different ways.
1.3.1.1. Con: The trust that you have to place in your reader means that you cannot challenge their interpretation, or really "think" about your problem in a new way. Instead you must trust and believe.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: [Anyone](http://www.psychicpower.com.au/tarot-readings/18-misguided-myths-about-tarot-cards-and-tarot-readings/) can learn to read Tarot cards. There is no need to place trust exclusively in a reader.
1.3.1.2. Pro: A Tarot reading forces you to examine questions you have in your life deeply and then ask further questions based on a random card draw. This has the tendency to take you through different thought patterns than you would on your own.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Tarot readings, in many cases, involve long conversations about your life problems with other open minded people. This can expose you to new perspectives.
1.3.2. Con: Many approaches are unhelpful. Valuing diversity does not need mean that we must accept absolutely all approaches.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Many racist, sexist, uninformed and hateful ideas remain in society. We feel no obligation to condone them or say that they have a place in our society simply because we value diversity.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The [tolerance paradox](https://bigthink.com/21st-century-spirituality/should-we-tolerate-the-intolerant) holds that in order to ensure tolerance for diversity, some views must be excluded.
1.3.2.3. Con: These arguments refer to false, or hateful claims. Tarot fills neither of these criteria. It is no more acceptable to exclude Tarot than it is to marginalise religious views.
1.4. Pro: Tarot can be used for more than telling the future - it can be used as part of clinical practice and for broadening thought processes too
1.4.1. Pro: Tarot readers have strong incentives to make readings positive which can improve ones confidence in life.
1.4.1.1. Con: Making a reading positive could hide more negative aspects which may be important for the querent to explore
1.4.1.2. Pro: Many professional Tarot readers operate as a business. Clients are unlikely to return without a feeling of positive outlook on their life.
1.4.1.3. Pro: It is possible to reframe something negative as something life changing that someone needs to go through in order to learn something important
1.4.1.4. Pro: Confidence is an [important](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beautiful-minds/201112/confidence-matters-just-much-ability) contributor to individual performance.
1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.
1.4.3. Con: Clinical practice should be evidence-based. Tarot is not based on science so should not be used as part of clinical practice.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Scientific methods for self help or healthcare are better because they can be tested and peer reviewed. Tarot cards can not be because they provide random results by nature.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Results from Tarot cards and methods for predictions can be peer reviewed on [online forums](https://www.thetarotforum.com/forum/) or through conversations.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: These forums do not have the same standards as an entire body of scientific study such as modern medicine.
1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: These forums tend to not have the same number of readers and reviewers.
1.4.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: When methods are repeated there are limited means to guarantee that methodologies have been faithfully repeated.
1.4.3.1.1.1.3. Con: These forums would gain higher standards if Tarot was more popularized.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Methods such as medication, or therapy, can be repeated and tested. A random draw of a card can not.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: Randomness can be mitigated by making the control group have the same reading \(or group people into control groups with the same cards being drawn\).
1.4.3.1.2.2. Con: The methodology of Tarot is far more than drawing cards. Infinite interpretations can be made from the same drawing. This means that honing Tarot methodologies are more about how you read as opposed to just what was drawn.
1.4.3.1.2.3. Con: Tarot readings' accuracy could be tested through a large enough population, and through analysis of these results to see if those results are statistically significant.
1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.4.5. Con: The fact that people think Tarot is an adequate substitute for clinical practice means that many people forgo clinical help for Tarot readings. This means that these people don't get the proper help they need.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Mental health care is a long and difficult process. Therapy can take years in order to reach breakthroughs. When Tarot seems to provide all of the answers it can be easy to forgo the more difficult path of modern mental healthcare.
1.5. Pro: Tarot is an enjoyable activity.
1.5.1. Con: Often, Tarot can be used to offer false comfort to those in desperation.
1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.5.2. Pro: Tarot can help to build important friendships and communities.
1.5.2.1. Con: A relationship with a reader is unequal because the reader provides insights and information that the client desperately wants. This is an unhealthy foundation for a friendship or support structure.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.5.2.1.2. Con: Readings do not have to operate with an unequal power dynamic. In many cases, Tarot is [self read](https://www.micheleknight.com/articles/psychic/tarot-articles/can-you-read-tarot-for-yourself/) or individuals switch off who is reader.
1.5.2.2. Pro: [Online Tarot communities](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/tarot-cards-facebook/) have forged connections and friendships across the globe.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: This is true of any activity that can have an online group surrounding it, it does not mean that Tarot is intrinsically good.
1.5.2.2.2. Pro: Online Tarot communities are [especially welcoming](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/tarot-cards-facebook/) places for new individuals bringing people joy and comfort.
1.5.3. Pro: The intricate artwork and culture surrounding Tarot bring great joy to those that use the cards.
1.5.4. Con: Often this isn't the case. Many people have unfortunately [distressing](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/alice-grist/when-psychics-go-bad-how-_b_1736613.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmllLw&guce_referrer_cs=8EbJNvuKUe-jOoqucOEKqg) experiences with Tarot readers.
1.5.4.1. Pro: When this happens, distressed customers find it nearly [impossible](https://exemplore.com/paranormal/Can-You-Sue-a-Psychic-The-History-of-Psychic-Lawsuits) to sue their readers.
1.6. Pro: Tarot is still very popular, so it has its place in modern society irrespective of its detractors.
1.6.1. Pro: Tarot appears to be gaining popularity. A [revival](https://www.villagevoice.com/2016/03/09/the-tarot-society-brings-esoteric-sound-to-out-to-see-fest/) is evident in the U.S.
1.6.2. Con: Just because something is popular, doesn't mean it should still be around.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Harmful drugs, like crack cocaine, are popular, but many of them should not be around due to their detrimental effects on health.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: Drug usage [harms](https://www.drugrehab.org/how-does-drug-abuse-affect-society-and-you/) an entire society. Tarot only effects those who wish to engage with it.
1.6.2.2. Con: There is no reason to get rid of something that is popular.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: A practice should be allowed to take place, unless it can be proven to be more harmful than not harmful \(if taking a purely utilitarian viewpoint\).
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.6.4. Pro: The dangers of fraud are well known and widely [discussed](https://www.thetarotlady.com/6-warning-signs-that-your-tarot-reader-may-be-a-scam-artist/). Individuals are well able to decide themselves whether to trust a reader.
1.7. Con: The use of Tarot by people outside of its original [progenitors](http://www.walkingbetweenworlds.com/2016/02/tarot-a-controversial-history/) has been linked to [cultural appropriation](http://cameoamalthea.tumblr.com/post/108101625932/tarot-cards-and-cultural-appropriation) and the reinforcement of negative [stereotypes](http://www.voiceofroma.com/culture/gyp_vs_rom.shtml) about the Roma ethnicity.
1.7.1. Pro: The stereotype of psychics being [frauds](https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/types-of-scams/buying-or-selling/psychic-clairvoyant) means that those outside the communities from which Tarot originated, who practice Tarot now, attach this stigma to the communities from which the cards originate.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Tarot cards were originally designed as a [game](https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/the-surprising-origins-of-tarot-most-misunderstood-cards/), not for fortune telling.
1.7.2. Con: Culture naturally gets appropriated if it is accepted, and changed as it mixes with the receiving culture. This is normal and is not a valid reason to not doing something, so long as it doesn't require that the progenitors adopt those changes.
1.7.3. Con: By changing the cultural association of Tarot \(e.g. being adopted by the New Age movement\), this potentially opens up more positive associations to the Roma ethnicity.
1.8. Con: Tarot is no longer necessary now that we have mental health therapies, and neuroscience to better understand ourselves and what are the best actions to take.
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.8.2. Con: Tarot is not used by everyone as a substitute for science-based approaches, but in addition to these approaches.
1.8.3. Con: People should not be forced to stop a practice like Tarot just because it is seen as being superseded \(e.g. by science or psychology\).
1.8.3.1. Pro: Science gets superseded with new science, but aspects of the old science can still be useful and a building block to new approaches. The same could be the same for Tarot.
1.8.4. Con: If these approaches truly did replace Tarot, people would not feel the need to continue getting readings.
1.8.4.1. Pro: For some people, a life based purely on Science is insufficient, and Tarot fills a gap
1.8.4.2. Con: -> See 1.6.2.
1.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.
1.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.9. Pro: There is more than science in the world, so excluding Tarot because it is unscientific is arrogant.
1.9.1. Pro: All religions and faith require belief in claims that cannot be proven scientifically.
1.9.2. Con: Many claims by Tarot readers are made [vague](https://psmag.com/social-justice/2014-tarot-reading-72148) so that they cannot be challenged empirically. It is naive to continue to grant them credence on the basis that some things in life cannot be proven scientifically.
1.9.2.1. Con: This means that they can cause less harm to individuals because they do not coerce any particular actions.
1.9.2.2. Pro: Often readers provide explanations including that you [changed your future](http://tarotbyhilary.com/why-didnt-my-reading-come-true/), or had a bad connection with your reader. Such explanations seem unsatisfactory as answers to those whose readings haven't materialised.
1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.10. Con: People may believe what they are being told with Tarot readings, which could lead them to do things that are not in their best interest.
1.10.1. Con: A person may do things that are in their best interest as well, as long as the Tarot reading is used for exploration of a situation rather than as a rulebook for how someone should live their life
1.10.2. Con: A person receiving a Tarot reading has a choice whether to make use of all, part, or none of what has been given in the reading. They have free will.
1.10.3. Pro: Some people may take readings literally \(e.g. Death card\) and become anxious or depressed by a reading, or how they remember a reading.
1.10.4. Pro: Tarot gives you an excuse to not take responsibility for your own decisions.
1.10.4.1. Pro: It is easy to interact with Tarot cards \(and readers\) with a "tell me what to do" mentality as opposed to making your own choices.
1.10.4.2. Pro: Not taking responsibility for your own decisions can result in a lack of learning and lack of guilt for bad actions. This is counterproductive for personal growth.
