Discussion Title: Compulsory Voting: Should Voting be Mandatory?

1. Citizens in democratic states should be required to vote or be fined.
1.1. Pro: Compulsory voting may [decrease](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/23098/1/Compulsory_voting\(LSERO\).pdf) the cost of elections as well as [mobilisation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ruth-marcus-a-case-for-compulsory-voting/2014/11/04/9b486afe-6463-11e4-836c-83bc4f26eb67_story.html?utm_term=.06bd60b44633) and political campaigns, and those resources can then be used on other issues.
1.1.1. Con: The referenced studies do little to demonstrate that election costs will be reduced with mandatory voting and it is counter-intuitive that it would cost less for more people to vote.
1.1.2. Pro: The money saved in mobilisation campaigns can be devoted to new resources to identify and fine citizens who did not vote.
1.1.2.1. Con: Ultimately this doesn't actually generate net income, as any money saved must be spent to keep the system going.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: The point is not about the system generating new income, but that the implementation of mandatory voting does not come with an extra economic burden.
1.1.3. Con: Strict election laws can reduce expenses in mobilisation and political campaigns. In [Germany](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/09/why-germany-s-politics-are-much-saner-cheaper-and-nicer-than-ours/280081/), campaigns get government funding, parties are allocated TV advertising time, and micro-targeting voters does not occur. This leads to cheap and short elections.
1.1.4. Pro: The fines collected from citizens who have not voted will generate revenue for the government and can be used for welfare schemes.
1.1.4.1. Con: Creating an incentive for bureaucracies to not make voting easy - in order to improve the welfare system - is unjust and leads to worse outcomes.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: There is no reason why bureaucrats can't work towards improving the efficiency of the welfare state while still relying on additional revenue.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The difference in this case is that there is a moral hazard created for the government because they would profit from keeping turnout low.
1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: As most countries with compulsory voting achieve really high turnouts, and that is a likely outcome, the amount collected from fines would probably not be very high. Therefore, it is unlikely it could work as an incentive to keep turnout low to get profits.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.1.
1.1.4.1.3. Con: The fact that there are penalties for not voting that generate money does not automatically mean bureaucrats will seek to make voting less effective. That is questioning professional honesty from the beginning.
1.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Many [countries](https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/628368-of-31-countries-with-compulsory-voting,-a-dozen-actually-enforce-it) with compulsory voting also implement systems to make voting easier, such as holding elections on Sundays or Saturdays, allowing postal voting or early voting, and creating mobile booths in hospitals or retirement homes.
1.1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: [Australia](http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/ways_to_vote/) has many options available if you are unable to make it to a polling place on a Saturday, which include voting early or by post.
1.1.4.1.4. Con: It would be significantly simpler for governments to raise money from other measures - like new or increased taxes, or fines for other forms of activity \(like speeding\) - than it will be to discourage people from doing something they are required by law to do, and fined for not doing.
1.1.4.1.5. Con: Implementing policies aimed at preventing people from voting in order to raise money would surely result in considerable uproar from the general public.
1.1.4.1.5.1. Con: This assumes that the way the government does this is obvious. It is not hard to consider ways they could do this sneakily \(such as not ensuring that there are sufficient polling places to avoid long queues\).
1.1.4.1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.1.1.
1.1.4.2. Con: Given the high voting rates likely to be generated by this policy and the relatively small fines which would be levied, this would likely be insignificant in comparison to the welfare budget.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Additionally, the costs of implementing the system probably means that there will be a net loss to government.
1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: In large democracies like India and the US, it would be a huge administrative burden and expenditure to identify citizens who have not voted, impose a fine and collect the fines.
1.1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Administrative costs of elections in countries like India are associated with [registration of voters](https://www.bemoneyaware.com/blog/cost-of-india-lok-sabha-elections-2014/). Post-election identification of those who did not vote is relatively easier, as you simply compare the list of registered voters with the list of people who did not show up to vote.
1.1.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Post-election identification of the innumerable homeless people and migrant labourers who are not on voting lists would be almost impossible for such a hugely populated country as India.
1.1.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: Mandatory voting may bring higher costs for polling locations, machines, workers, safety, etc.
1.1.4.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Voting arrangements are made such that the entire population of a country could vote if it wanted to; otherwise, the state would literally be preventing people from voting. Compulsory voting would therefore have no effect on the logistics of voting.
1.1.4.2.1.1.3. Con: Ecuador has mandatory voting. [They issue proof of having voted at the polling stations.](http://www.elcomercio.com/actualidad/seguridad/certificado-obligatorio-1947.html) This documentation is required for entering into legal agreements, dealing with government agencies and can be demanded by the various levels of police. The cost? Simply printing sheets with credit card sized slips with each voter's information. Any citizen and long term residents that have a national ID card is included in the process.
1.1.4.2.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.4.2.1.1.5. Con: Such systems already exist. For example, the IRS in the US identifies and pursues citizens who have not paid taxes they owe.
1.1.5. Con: [Most](http://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/releases/ad-spending-tops-1-billion/) campaign spending is allocated to TV advertising. Well-informed voters are not likely to be influenced by a simplistic 30-second ad, unlike relatively ignorant voters. Thus an increase in the electorate that could be more influenced by television is likely to cause more expenditure during election time.
1.1.5.1. Con: This assumes that just because more people are voting, the electorate is more ignorant on the whole. However, it is likely that people will on average be more informed with compulsory voting.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: When citizens are required to vote, there is an incentive to become more politically engaged and informed.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: The more people who vote the lower the incentive to vote is. If an election was determined by a single person, that single person has a high incentive to vote. If the election is decided by 5 trillion people his incentive to vote is tiny. The incentive to educate oneself is not increased by compulsory voting.
1.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Forcing citizens to vote encourages targeting uninformed voters.
1.1.5.1.1.3. Con: Members of Congress and the House of Representatives are given the option to abstain from voting when unsure of a decision, therefore citizens should also be given the option to abstain when they feel they do not have the necessary information to make an informed decission
1.1.5.1.1.4. Con: The duty of a citizen is the duty to be an informed participant in the arena of public governance. This includes being current and sincere on the topics that voting affects. If one has abrogated this duty, voting only compounds the problems. One has a duty not to vote if one is uninformed or hostile to the aims of government.
1.1.5.1.1.5. Con: Citizens who used to not vote will be tempted to vote for a random candidate, or based on non political aspects \(look, gender, race...\) just to avoid being fined.
1.1.5.1.1.6. Con: People are not going to be incentivized to become more informed when they did not care to vote in the first place. Compelling a vote no one cares to cast won't make them more interested in the facts, and they will not invest the time or effort to do so. The claim presupposes a belief in the value of a vote.
1.1.5.1.1.6.1. Pro: The energy used in forcing people to be vote would be of better use in educating them to vote with relevant information.
1.1.5.1.1.6.2. Pro: That would increase the proportion of voters that don't have the education or reflexion required to choose sensibly.
1.1.5.1.1.7. Pro: Individuals are less likely to feel disenfranchised from their democracy in countries where compulsory voting exists \(such as Australia\).
1.1.5.1.1.8. Con: One can cast a blank vote or spoil their ballot if they don't want to vote. If people go for this option, they won't feel the need to inform themselves.
1.1.5.1.1.8.1. Con: Informal or blank ballots could be miscounted in favour of one outcome and would not be traceable given the entire population voted. With voluntary voting, this corruption is harder as if the number of votes counted outnumbered the number counted, then something would clearly be wrong.
1.1.5.1.1.8.1.1. Con: There is no data that suggests that the ratio of miscounted votes would increase or decrease with or without compulsory voting.
1.1.5.1.1.8.2. Pro: Mandatory voting would not be an incentive to become more politically engaged or informed; it takes no effort to check a box.
1.1.5.1.1.8.2.1. Pro: Until disenchanted voters have more faith in their leaders, this incentive is unlikely to change.
1.1.5.1.1.8.2.2. Pro: If people aren't willing to put in enough effort to check a box without mandatory voting laws, it is unlikely that they would put in the effort it takes to become informed.
1.1.5.1.1.8.3. Pro: Whether as a collective or as an individual, the capacity to acknowledge ignorance is crucial to our ability to discern the truth. By forcing people to vote you dilute the informed's voice, and exaggerate the ignorant's.
1.1.5.1.1.9. Con: Citizens could also become weary of politics because they are burdened with this additional obligatory duty.
1.1.5.1.1.9.1. Con: Those who see this as burdensome would not have voted otherwise, so it does not make difference. At least some people will be more engaged.
1.1.5.1.1.9.1.1. Con: Even those who would have voted were it optional might be angry with the government for imposing upon them. They could respond by disengaging.
1.1.5.1.1.9.1.1.1. Con: To respond to an attempt to increase engagement by disengaging seems like an irrational response, especially since disengaging won't achieve anything.
1.1.5.1.1.9.1.1.2. Con: Engaged citizens care about a variety of things. It's unclear why compulsory voting will be the one thing that they care about more than everything else. In the instance that a few people do care about this the most, even fewer of that group are likely to react by disengaging.
1.1.5.1.1.9.2. Con: Given that elections are only held every few years, this is not particularly burdensome for any individual.
1.1.5.1.1.10. Con: Selective [exposure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_exposure_theory) theory and [reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_theory) theory explain how humans tend to seek and remember information that reinforces their own preexisting beliefs. Consuming more biased information just makes for even more uniformed opinions.
1.1.5.1.1.10.1. Con: [Studies](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~garrettk/Garrett-ICA-Seeking_Similarity-final.pdf) have shown that, while people prefer to find or follow news that are similar to their own beliefs, they do not actively avoid difference. The analysis shows that Americans use the control afforded by online information sources to increase their exposure to opinions consistent with their own views, without sacrificing contact with other opinions.
1.1.5.1.1.10.2. Con: Compulsory voting is likely to increase efforts by politicians to pierce through political echo-chambers in order to increase their chances of getting elected. This prevents voters from selectively informing themselves of political opinions.
1.1.5.1.1.10.3. Pro: Social media algorithms, such as the one [Facebook](https://www.wired.com/2016/11/facebook-echo-chamber/) uses, create and reinforce echo-chambers of political views.
1.1.5.1.1.10.4. Con: To the extent to which this is true, it is both more true and more problematic when people are disincentivised to inform themselves, and thus likely to only passively consume news. When this is the case, they are even less likely to find and consume news and information that challenges their beliefs.
1.1.5.1.1.11. Pro: When everyone must vote, politics is much more likely to be a topic of conversation among one's friends, peers, colleagues, etc., which will spur people to be more informed and to form opinions.
1.1.5.1.1.11.1. Pro: Compulsory voting would force citizens who so far ignore politics to deal with our collective problems and also think about possible solutions. The status quo where non-voters just complain without an effort to improve is a pointless waste of time and energy.
1.1.5.1.1.11.2. Con: Voting is a personal thing. People may still be uncomfortable talking about politics with their friends, who may have different opinions.
1.1.5.1.1.11.3. Con: There is no reason why compulsory voting means that people want to talk about politics with their friends. If they would otherwise not have voted then they probably have no interest in discussing it anyway.
1.1.5.1.1.12. Con: When a whole population becomes more politically aware, there is a higher probability that the affected country gets politically divided.
1.1.5.1.1.12.1. Con: This is an argument for keeping particular constituencies - such as African-Americans in the US or the Dalits in India - politically disenfranchised, as the country may get divided when they exercise their rights.
1.1.5.1.1.12.2. Con: This assumes that the life some people were living before the country became divided was worth preventing political division. Many disenfranchised minorities across the world would risk political divide if it gave them the opportunity to manifestly improve their lives.
1.1.5.1.1.12.3. Con: There is nothing wrong with political division in society. The only real harm occurs if the division leads to violence, yet no country with compulsory voting has seen an increase in violence linked with compulsory voting.
1.1.5.1.1.12.4. Con: Division in society is not caused by political awareness; instead, division is the result of tangible conditions in people's lives, which they feel are less good than those of other citizens.
1.1.5.1.1.13. Pro: If you know that you have to vote, it makes it more likely that you will pay attention to politics and the news, even if this is only directly before the election.
1.1.5.1.1.13.1. Con: Given the current media landscape, it may be very difficult for voters to distinguish good and reliable sources from yellow and biased journalism
1.1.5.1.1.13.2. Con: In Australia, [some people](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/election-2016-voter-turnout-lowest-since-compulsory-voting-began-in-1925-20160808-gqnij2.html) don't get informed and don't vote - even if it is mandatory - because the penalties are not enough to make people care.
1.1.5.1.1.13.2.1. Pro: In Australia, penalties for not-voting are not so prohibitive: a no-show will be [fined](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/election-2016-voter-turnout-lowest-since-compulsory-voting-began-in-1925-20160808-gqnij2.html) $20 if no explanation for absence is given, and if still unresponsive, will be fined $180. The penalty for not voting wouldn't be enough to force most people into participating.
1.1.5.1.1.13.2.1.1. Con: At best, this is a reason to raise the penalty in order to create a greater incentive for people to vote.
1.1.5.1.1.13.2.1.2. Con: At the 2013 Australian election, [approximately 94%](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23810381) of eligible voters turned out to vote. This suggests that a $20 fine is a sufficient deterrent to not voting.
1.1.5.1.1.13.2.1.2.1. Con: This merely shows that the deterrent was sufficient in 2013. [2016 was the lowest voter turnout since compulsory voting was implemented in 1925.](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/election-2016-voter-turnout-lowest-since-compulsory-voting-began-in-1925-20160808-gqnij2.html)
1.1.5.1.1.13.2.1.2.1.1. Con: In 2016, approximately [91% of eligible voters](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/election-2016-voter-turnout-lowest-since-compulsory-voting-began-in-1925-20160808-gqnij2.html) still turned out to vote, which is still a very high percentage.
1.1.5.1.1.13.3. Pro: This has additional benefits as it means that people are more likely to let their voice be heard when a government tries to implement a policy they don't like.
1.1.5.1.1.13.4. Con: This is a fairly common occurrence in an optional voting situation already.
1.1.5.1.1.13.4.1. Con: While it is fairly common among certain groups of people \(especially those who vote\), compulsory voting is likely to add an additional incentive for those who wouldn't currently follow the news.
1.1.5.1.1.14. Con: Since a single vote is unlikely to change electoral outcomes, a large number of voters do not care to inform themselves, as the burden of getting informed outweighs the benefits of casting a well-informed vote [\(Downs in Milner, p. 27\)](https://books.google.es/books?hl=es&lr=&id=jOMuqXpMfuEC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=democracy+voters+should+make+informed+decision&ots=88_hD22FJ8&sig=ETbbo152_2rN0GsXWmU_5sFV0Wo&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.1.5.1.1.14.1. Pro: If the majority of the electorate is well-informed, there is little value in getting informed as the individual voter will reap the benefits of an informed result. If the electorate is not well-informed, the individual voter will not be able to change the results with a single vote [\(Downs in Milner, p. 27\)](https://books.google.es/books?hl=es&lr=&id=jOMuqXpMfuEC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=democracy+voters+should+make+informed+decision&ots=88_hD22FJ8&sig=ETbbo152_2rN0GsXWmU_5sFV0Wo&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.1.5.1.1.15. Con: People can vote in response to a hot-button issue or a scandal, or in reflection of a psychological attachment to a political party; rather than voting for the party that best represents their policy preferences.
1.1.5.1.1.15.1. Con: If that issue is what they care most about at the time of the election, it is unclear why it is a bad outcome for them to voted base on it.
1.1.5.1.1.16. Pro: Voters will be forced to take responsibility for the actions of their representative government. Voluntary disassociation via abstention will no longer allow people to wash their hands of their government's actions.
1.1.5.1.1.16.1. Con: Just because you vote in an election does not mean you are responsible for the outcome. For example, more than 50% of American voters did not vote for Donald Trump and they should not consider themselves responsible for his policies.
1.1.5.1.1.16.2. Con: Given that voting is a personal choice that can be kept private \(or lied about\), it is unclear what this responsibility will look like. Without any pressure from other people, this is unlikely to change the way they act.
1.1.5.1.1.16.3. Pro: Not voting psychologically absolves people from the actions of their government and facilitates disengagement from the political arena.
1.1.5.1.1.16.4. Con: Politicians rarely follow through completely with the promises they made at election time. Voting for a politician based on policies they promised to implement is not the same as being responsible for policies they end up implementing when in power.
1.1.5.2. Con: If the voters most likely to vote in the status quo are on average more informed, and parties are still directing the majority of their spending towards TV ads, they clearly do influence more informed voters.
1.1.6. Con: Some [studies](http://www.gmu.edu/centers/publicchoice/faculty%20pages/stratmann/vitae%20files/turned_on_or_turned_out_2011.pdf) have concluded that, more than campaign expenditures, what really influences turnout is the information provided. Well-funded campaigns with high influence of special interest groups can “turn off” voters, while campaigning that offers clear information, more so when it is free to voters, increases turnout.
1.1.7. Pro: Studies conclude that candidates generally [advertise](https://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2008/Houser-Morton-Stratman.pdf) more when voting is voluntary than when it is mandatory.
1.1.8. Con: This argument only applies to countries where governments fund political parties. In countries where political parties fund their own campaigns, the money they would have spent on a campaign is likely to be spent by them on other areas that promote the party, rather than solve any issue in the country.
1.1.8.1. Pro: In [Australia](https://www.psa.ac.uk/insight-plus/beyond-turnout-consequences-compulsory-voting), the Liberal National Coalition supported compulsory voting in order to put their resources elsewhere, instead of into mobilisation, probably ending up with the same overall expenditure.
1.1.8.2. Pro: Politicians would still spend that money to convince citizens to vote for them above other candidates.
1.1.8.3. Con: In countries where voting is not mandatory and where political parties fund their campaigns, a politician's priority is fundraising and not governing. Mandatory voting lowers the cost of generating turnout, thereby [reducing pressure on a politician](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/277462-60-minutes-fundraising-demands-turning-lawmakers-into) to spend potential governing time on raising funds.
1.1.8.3.1. Pro: US Democrats elected to Congress are advised to spend as much as [4 hours a day](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/08/call-time-congressional-fundraising_n_2427291.html) making fundraising calls, and additional time doing fundraiser set-up and donor outreach events.
1.1.8.4. Con: There is no public funding for political parties in a small number of countries, such as Malta, Switzerland and India. Yet it still applies to a large number of [democracies](https://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/facts/DICE/Public-Sector/Public-Governance-and-Law/Financing-of-Political-Parties/Financing-political-parties-public-funding/fileBinary/Financing-political-parties-public-funding.pdf), such as most of the EU, Canada, Brazil, Japan and even the US.
1.1.8.5. Con: Even if parties fund their own campaigns, there are several forms of public [subsidies](http://www.oecd.org/gov/ethics/Money-in-politics.pdf) devoted to political parties and electoral participation such as tax breaks, access to public services \(including free airtime\) and buildings, provision of goods, etc. Therefore, the reduction in public spending still applies.
1.1.8.6. Con: More countries are seeing the necessity of public [funding](http://www.oecd.org/gov/ethics/Money-in-politics.pdf) to counterbalance big amounts of [private](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/24/world/global-campaign-finance/) money that can have too much influence on policy. Therefore, more and more systems incorporate some form of public funding that compulsory voting could help reduce.
1.1.8.6.1. Pro: In the UK, the advisory board recommended an increase in public funding to limit influence of donors in elections - as no one gives large sums of money “without expecting something in [return](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/24/world/global-campaign-finance/)” - yet major parties rejected it.
1.1.9. Con: Since there will be more voters, more money will be spent in reaching them in order to gain their votes.
1.1.9.1. Con: However, if that money comes from private sources, it does not directly affect a country's national budget.
1.1.9.2. Con: If they are committed to attend the polls and vote, that will reduce the cost of reaching them - less political advertising will be needed when politicians merely need to communicate their message in comparison to other candidates, as opposed to also needing to motivate voters to turn out.
1.1.9.2.1. Pro: In the 2013 Australian election, the two major parties spent [approximately $10-12 AUD per vote received](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/03/coalition-outgunned-labor-party-by-25m-in-pre-election-spending-race). By comparison, in the recent US election, the Presidential candidates alone spent [$5-10 USD per vote received](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-spending-idUSKBN1341JR), before taking into account spending on House and Senate races, which is substantial.
1.2. Con: Without enough time allocated, assurances that police wouldn't fish at polls and the like, mandatory voting is simply an assault on the working class.
1.3. Pro: In the short term, compulsory voting would necessitate improvement in voting conditions and make it possible for ordinary working people to vote.
1.3.1. Pro: It would put the obligation on governments and not the people to enfranchise everyone.
1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.6.
1.4. Pro: Compulsory voting encourages politicians to be less extreme in the policies they propose.
1.4.1. Pro: With optional voting, politicians need to give people a reason to actually go to the polls and vote. This often means that politicians will push for incendiary policies that encourage people to vote.
1.4.1.1. Pro: This also is an additional cost that has to be borne as candidates must spend money on 'get out to vote' campaigns.
1.4.1.2. Con: This practice will not vanish entirely with compulsory voting, as politicians can push for incendiary policies in order to catch the votes of the uninformed or extreme-minded citizens.
1.4.2. Con: [Non-voting is highest among third parties](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~nuff0084/FisherTT.pdf)' supporters including extremist parties' supporters. Compulsory voting would disproportionality increase extremist supporter turnout over non-extremist supporter turnout.
1.4.3. Con: If a politician wants to encourage people who needed to be coerced into voting to vote for them, they will need to offer populist or unrealistic policies.
1.4.3.1. Pro: In countries like India, which have large and incredibly diverse populations, a middle ground for policies that involves the entire population is often unachievable \([Ayesha Jalal, p. 75](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/students/modules/hi173/classesandreading/decolonization_and_india1/democ__aut_-_pp.66-77.pdf)\). This results in deadlock within parliament, or weak coalitions.
1.4.4. Con: Politicians still have to attract voters, and having some rather extreme positions is a way to do this and stand apart from the rest.
1.4.4.1. Con: Adopting extreme positions can get you votes, but is unlikely to get the majority of the population behind you. A majority of America, for instance, is [moderate](http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/meet-the-moderates).
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Donald Trump represents some rather extreme positions, especially in immigration policy, and got elected President.
1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: Yet a majority of people [voted](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-us-president-wins-lose-popular-election-hillary-clinton-3-million-votes-russia-hacking-a7535701.html) for his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Trump's victory could be seen as an anomaly due to the particular US electoral system \(Electoral College\).
1.4.4.1.1.2. Con: A single election is not good data to base a conclusion about the relative success rates of moderates versus extremists. The overall trend of US elections is towards moderation - when extremists are selected in party primaries, the party is [less likely to win the seat](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/what-happens-when-extremists-win-primaries/ECAC69648AE0DF91D93103E18342B9D2).
1.4.4.2. Con: Standing out for the wrong reasons - policies most voters find extreme and unappealing - is more likely to lose you votes than it is to gain you them.
1.4.5. Pro: When all citizens are required to vote, there is an incentive for politicians to appeal to the largest groups of people \(i.e. the moderates\) to win government.
1.4.5.1. Con: There's no reason to automatically assume non-voters' views align more with the moderate perception in society. A [2008 Pew](http://www.people-press.org/2012/11/01/nonvoters-who-they-are-what-they-think/) study showed that non-voters roughly align with voters on the issues. This indicates that the incentives for politicians do not change all that much.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: The study shows alignment between voters and non-voters on mainstream issues. Non-voters attitudes towards mainstream issues is not representative of how they would vote for extreme candidates and on extreme policies.
1.4.5.2. Pro: On the other hand, without compulsory voting, there is a greater incentive to [appeal to one's 'base'](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/opinion/voting-should-be-mandatory.html?_r=1) \(i.e. the people with whom you most strongly share ideology\). In this case, this tends to be more people with extreme views, as they hold their views more vehemently.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: This kind of vote bank politics in India has proven harmful enough for the Supreme Court to [ban](http://www.timesnow.tv/india/article/how-political-parties-have-relied-on-votebank-politics-ahead-of-polls/53726) the most common targets of vote banking, like religion.
1.4.5.2.2. Con: When one's political ideology is not extreme, it is irrational to appeal to extreme views. Politicians will seek to appeal to the base of voters with whom they actually have a common ideology, regardless of what that is.
1.4.5.2.3. Con: Those with extreme views do not necessarily hold them more vehemently - one can equally be a deeply committed moderate.
1.4.5.3. Con: The reason many people are moderate might be because they don't particularly [care for politics](http://blog.press.princeton.edu/author/jasonb/). When they are forced to have an opinion, it is speculative as to whether they would therefore stay moderate.
1.4.5.3.1. Con: Moderate voters don't need to change their behaviour. The fact that they are now forced to vote ensures that politicians will appeal to them.
1.4.5.3.2. Con: It is untrue to assume that all moderates are the same. While it is true that there are some people who are moderate because they don't care, there are also many others who strongly hold opinions that are considered to be moderate in society.
1.4.5.4. Con: This also applies for optional voting. Politicians target the largest groups in order to get the most votes. That is why in [most democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ruling_political_parties_by_country) no extreme parties are in charge.
1.4.5.4.1. Con: The Republicans in the USA consistently target policies toward strongly conservative Christians, who most commonly vote for them, despite this group representing only a fraction of the electorate.
1.4.5.4.1.1. Pro: This is shown by the fact that this group is almost always represented by a Presidential or Vice-Presidential candidate for the Republicans.
1.4.5.4.2. Con: Voting rates are decreasing in many countries, allowing far-right parties to turn out enough voters to win elections. This can be seen with a clear trend of politics moving towards the extreme right in [Europe](http://time.com/4504010/europe-politics-swing-right/). Compulsory voting, by turning out sufficient people, can dilute the ability of far-right parties to win.
1.4.5.4.2.1. Pro: Some of the European countries with lowest [turnouts](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2014/140739/LDM_BRI\(2014\)140739_REV1_EN.pdf) in general elections - like [Hungary](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/hungary/11532818/Hungarys-far-Right-anti-Semitic-Jobbik-party-wins-its-first-by-election.html) \(46.7%\) or Poland \(48.9%\) - are also the ones where the far-right has achieved better [results](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/22/world/europe/europe-right-wing-austria-hungary.html?_r=0).
1.4.5.4.2.2. Pro: In [Belgium](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/02/belgium-workers-party-wallonia-ceta-eu/), where voting is compulsory, there is no such swing to the extreme right. In fact, it is rather the left that has gained ground.
1.4.5.4.2.2.1. Con: Belgium - where voting is mandatory - has several parliamentary [parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_parties_in_Belgium) rooted in traditional cleavages, not different from the [ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_the_Netherlands) in the Netherlands - where voting is not mandatory. The number of parties in Belgium is only higher because they also have linguistic cleavages, yet both countries have [extremists](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085728_2085727_2085704,00.html) that have gained local or national representation. Thus mandatory voting does not seem to have a large effect on political landscapes.
1.4.5.4.2.3. Con: Austria, which does not currently have compulsory voting and has a very high [turnout](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2014/140739/LDM_BRI\(2014\)140739_REV1_EN.pdf), \(74.9%\), has also seen a similar [rise](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/22/world/europe/europe-right-wing-austria-hungary.html?_r=0) in far-right parties. The same can be said about the Netherlands \(74.6%\) and, although with lower turnouts, a similar trend can be seen in [France](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/marine-le-pen-concede-defeat-historic-massive-result-far-right-front-national-emmanuel-macron-french-a7723206.html).
1.4.5.5. Con: Politicians with extreme convictions \(left, right\) are very unlikely to abandon them just because of having to appeal to a larger electorate.
1.4.5.5.1. Con: While the convictions of extreme politicians may not be affected, this acts as a disincentive for moderate politicians against appealing to the extremes.
1.4.5.5.2. Con: These convictions are diluted when a larger electorate is voting, which means that they become less important and considered.
1.4.5.5.2.1. Con: This is based upon the assumption that the existing non-voters are likely to be more moderate than extreme, which may not be true.
1.4.5.5.3. Con: Mandatory voting has consequences on policy. Australia saw conservative parties shifting to more progressive policies when large numbers of working-class voters were forced to vote. Therefore, compulsory voting improved representation \([Fowler, p. 28](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11156810/Fowler_gsas.harvard_0084L_10773.pdf?sequence=1)\).
1.4.5.5.3.1. Con: The study is based on a time when societies were more economically divided, therefore voting was very unequal due to massive abstention among lower classes voters. Those conclusions may not still stand nowadays.
1.4.5.5.3.1.1. Con: Many societies today are massively unequal. Even in more developed economies like the US, voting rates [differ](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/income-gap-at-the-polls-113997) hugely between classes, suggesting that compulsory voting would affect the policies of political parties.
1.4.5.5.3.2. Pro: Working-class individuals are both the least likely to vote and, were they to vote, overall likely to vote for left-wing parties and social redistributionist policies \([Lijphart, p. 1](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~iversen/PDFfiles/Lijphart1997.pdf)\). Without compulsory voting, citizens do not get policies that adequately represent the aggregate preferences of the whole population.
1.4.5.5.4. Con: A growing electorate works as an incentive for all politicians, including the extreme ones, as they all want to appeal to new voters.
1.4.5.5.5. Con: Those who fail to adapt will, over time, lose their seats and be replaced, or fail to be elected in the first place.
1.4.5.5.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.5.5.2.1.
1.4.5.5.6. Pro: Many politicians legitimately hold the views they espouse and consider the policies they support to be the correct approach.
1.4.5.6. Con: Deep ideological divisions and economic disparity can lead to [polarised](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Acrobat/Chapter%204%20Dalton%20Ideology%20Draft%203.pdf) countries in which politicians may tend to favour extremes, regardless of the voting system.
1.4.5.6.1. Pro: Similarly, it is not compulsory voting that leads to moderation per se. Studies have shown that [modernisation](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Acrobat/Chapter%204%20Dalton%20Ideology%20Draft%203.pdf) and long democratic traditions tend to lessen conflict and lead political systems towards moderation, regardless of the electoral system.
1.4.5.6.2. Pro: European party systems were shaped by political cleavages \(parties aligning through historical conflicts of class, state type, religion or nationalism\). Even though their influence has decreased, they still [impact](http://www.unc.edu/~gwmarks/assets/doc/marks.wilson%20-%20a%20cleavage%20theory%20of%20party%20response%20to%20European%20integration.pdf) political landscapes. Therefore, the amount of moderation or conflict in a political system will vary according to the cleavages of that society.
1.4.5.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.4.2.2.1.
1.4.5.7. Pro: Minority votes are often suppressed by political parties who have effectively given up on garnering their votes. This can be seen in the cases of [Republicans](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/10/republicans_are_already_suppressing_minority_votes_all_over_america.html) suppressing African American voters, the [BJP](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-politics-idUSKCN0WC2WR) suppressing Muslim votes in India, and [Arab](http://fathomjournal.org/why-dont-the-arabs-of-israel-vote-more/) votes being suppressed in Israel.
1.4.5.8. Pro: In general, requiring all citizens to vote will engage a more diverse set of voters, increasing the need for politicians to appeal to the centre.
1.4.6. Con: Donald Trump [benefited](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/09/02/why-smart-politicians-say-stupid-things-to-win-elections/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.c0d6e469f444) from political ignorance in the most recent US Presidential election. Non-voters typically tend to be less informed, and can be manipulated by populist politicians arguing for extreme policies, so there is no guarantee that compulsory voting will lead to a decrease in extreme policies.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Even if non-voters could be informed, voters tend to do a [poor job](https://balkin.blogspot.com/2013/10/why-political-ignorance-is-serious.html) of evaluating the information they do know, leaving open the considerable possibility of manipulation by extremist candidates.
1.4.6.2. Pro: Any smart politician has an [incentive](http://volokh.com/posts/1251127451.shtml) to manipulate political ignorance for their advantage. Compulsory voting just worsens the problem.
1.4.6.3. Con: As Donald Trump was unable to broaden his base due to his extreme policies, his campaign [persuaded](http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/27/13434246/donald-trump-targeted-dark-facebook-ads-black-voters) Clinton potential voters to stay at home. Thus compulsory voting forces politicians to moderate, appealing to more voters instead of just discouraging them.
1.4.7. Con: There is no clear reason for moderation being a good thing. Extreme policies can be required to solve structural inequalities within political and economic systems.
1.4.7.1. Con: In contrast to extreme convictions, moderation stands for tolerance.
1.4.7.1.1. Pro: Tolerance is a very important virtue of a pluralistic liberal democracy with its different views on questions of politics, morality, religion, and what it is to lead a good and meaningful life \([Lacewing, p. 3](http://cw.routledge.com/textbooks/alevelphilosophy/data/AS/Tolerance/ToleranceDemocracyPluralism.pdf)\).
1.4.7.1.2. Con: Moderation just describes the middle ground of political views in a society. It does not necessarily equate with tolerance.
1.4.7.1.2.1. Pro: For example, the majority of moderates in most societies would find the notion of incest to be abhorrent, which is not a particularly tolerant view.
1.4.7.1.2.2. Pro: In Australia, the dominant centre-left and centre-right parties both support the mandatory detention and offshore processing of asylum seekers. This is a particularly intolerant view supported by moderates.
1.4.7.1.2.3. Pro: For most of human history, gender equality was an extreme view. Until the 1950s, the same could be said for full racial equality. As recently as twenty years ago, supporters of same-sex marriage were relatively isolated extremists.
1.4.7.2. Con: Extreme politicians tend to realize their aims without considering potential consequences, whereas moderate politicians stand for responsibility \([ethic of ultimate ends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_end) vs. ethic of responsibility\).
1.4.7.2.1. Pro: [Mao Zedong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution) and the Communist party of China were ideologically driven and realized their targets without taking care of the disastrous consequences for the population.
1.4.7.2.1.1. Con: Comparing Mao Zedong’s “[democratic dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_democratic_dictatorship)” with a democratic politician driven by ideology is not adequate. While the former imposed his extreme ideology, the latter stands by their ideas always within democratic limits.
1.4.7.2.1.1.1. Con: Politicians such as [Viktor Orban](http://www.voanews.com/a/is-hungary-orban-autocrat-or-misunderstood-provocateur/3164978.html) in Hungary constantly try to increase their own power while limiting the power of both parliament and the constitution. Not all politicians choose to abide by democratic norms, some actively erode democratic institutions.
1.4.7.2.1.2. Con: This is an isolated example, not proof of any general trend.
1.4.7.2.2. Pro: "Extreme" means dedication to one ideology and acting accordingly. The aim, the realization of the ideology, is of the highest priority. [Harm](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1969/1/15/toward-an-ethic-of-political-conduct/) is considered as acceptable as long as the aim gets achieved.
1.4.7.2.3. Con: "Extreme" merely means that a politician's views differ significantly from the centre. That in no way requires that the politician be careless in regard to consequences, or have a lack of responsibility. Nor does being a centrist necessarily require that a politician have a greater sense of duty.
1.4.7.3. Con: Moderation means progress as it recognizes that all convictions have [a piece of truth as well as flaws](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/05/moderates-who-are-they-and-what-do-they-want/370904/). This leads to a recreation and advancement of political perspectives.
1.4.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.1.2.3.
1.4.8. Pro: [Intense partisans](http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/31/the-party-of-nonvoters-2/), who due to their fervent beliefs are often more extreme, are more likely to participate in lower turnout elections. Compulsory voting will therefore moderate electoral outcomes.
1.4.8.1. Con: This refers only to a strong bipartisan context such as the US. Yet in most contexts, regular voters are not necessarily more extreme than [marginal](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11156810/Fowler_gsas.harvard_0084L_10773.pdf?sequence=1), or non-regular, voters \(p. 3\).
1.4.8.2. Con: In many countries, younger [generations](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jul/04/voterapathy.uk1) tend to vote less [regularly](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=sei-working-paper-no-92.pdf&site=266), yet they are not necessarily more politically moderate.
1.4.9. Con: Yet available [research](http://blog.press.princeton.edu/author/jasonb/) has not found compulsory voting to produce more moderate electoral outcomes.
1.5. Pro: Citizens have a duty to maintain the democratic state by voting, which is enforced through compulsory voting.
1.5.1. Con: A democratic state's fundamental mode of operation is not threatened or undermined by a portion of the population abstaining from the process.
1.5.2. Con: Compulsory voting without the ballot options of "indifferent" or "none" forces a voter to decide on something they may not agree with, and undermines the purpose of having ones voice heard via vote-casting. Public opinion is inaccurately inferred.
1.5.2.1. Con: Individuals can still choose not to vote by submitting a protest or informal vote \(which is then not counted\).
1.5.2.1.1. Con: This is functionally equivalent to not voting at all, but wastes more time and money from both the voter and the bureaucrats.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: However it can be useful to determine the unhappiness of the population by quantifying the informal votes. This can't be inferred when compulsory voting does not exist.
1.5.2.1.2. Pro: Races for a seat could include options to vote for "none of the above" or "reported to the polling place".
1.5.2.1.2.1. Con: A "none of the above" option is functionally no different from not voting. This does not improve the process either way, unless a none of the above option has a function.
1.5.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Someone who hasn't voted for political reasons is indistinguishable in a vote count from someone who hasn't voted out of laziness or lack of interest. By contrast, a deliberately spoiled ballot is countable - in the informal vote - and so sends a stronger message.
1.5.2.1.2.1.2. Con: A primary function served by a "None of the above" or "Showed up" vote is to answer back our "wise ones" with "Is that the best you have to offer us? Try making it worth our while next time."
1.5.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Low voter turnout can also be seen as a message that the public don't like any of the wise ones available
1.5.2.1.2.1.3. Con: If you have to make the trip to the polling station anyway, you may be more likely to bother to cast a vote that you were too lazy to do otherwise.
1.5.2.1.2.2. Con: If a majority of people do that then it will nullify the voting process and would result in re-voting and the process goes on for ever with no leaders ever elected, similar to an infinite loop in computer programming.
1.5.2.1.3. Con: This still denies the freedom to either participate or not participate in the voting process. Both forms of expression should be permitted. That would give a more accurate representation of how many people went through the effort to enter a protest vote, and how many just stayed home.
1.5.2.1.4. Pro: In the 2016 United States presidential election, voters unsatisfied with the [DNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee), one of the most popular reasons for not supporting Hillary, could have used voting and write-in votes to show their further support for Bernie Sanders.
1.5.2.1.5. Con: Void or canceled ballots are not invalid to the democratic process; they represent a scope of political ideas potentially absent in the process. Not counting protest or void ballots is not a given, and dismissing these would make the process less democratic.
1.5.2.1.6. Pro: If they do this, the only cost to them is the need to head to the nearest voting booth, which is only a marginal impact on their freedom, especially as it only occurs very infrequently.
1.5.2.1.7. Pro: If the purpose is to register dissatisfaction with all candidates and parties, a protest vote is perhaps a more powerful statement than not voting.
1.5.2.1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.2.1.1.
1.5.2.1.7.2. Pro: Protest votes can be represented like this as well. Not voting at all will only give [more power](http://www.votenone.org.uk/protest_votes_count.html) to people who do vote, as only their interests are represented.
1.5.2.1.7.3. Pro: Even those who despise all applicants have the option of rejecting the system while still being politically engaged.
1.5.2.1.8. Pro: Systems where voting is compulsory register higher rates of [invalid](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/csuperti/files/blankasprotest_final.pdf?m=1455298855) votes than systems where it is optional.
1.5.3. Con: Forcing people to vote under threat of punishment would be an overt use of force on the part of the state. This in itself would be wholly undemocratic.
1.5.3.1. Con: The basic mechanism of government is the use of force. What makes a system democratic or not is how the system decides when and how to use that force; after a vote, the losers don't get to opt out of the decision that the winners made.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: In principle this is true, but the issue is how far government should be allowed to intrude into the lives of individuals with the use of force.
1.5.3.2. Pro: A democracy wherein the population can be threatened for political crimes simply by being indifferent to an outcome is arguably not a free and democratic society in the first place.
1.5.3.3. Pro: The use of force is generally immoral. Laws should be restricted to actions that directly violate one’s individual rights. Not voting doesn’t limit anyone else’s rights to life, liberty or property.
1.5.3.4. Con: Whether a government is democratic has absolutely nothing to do with whether it uses force to establish and defend itself or its laws.

Indeed, every democracy in the world without exception uses force to support elections - for example, by making election fraud illegal.  It is almost certainly impossible to have democracy *without* the use of force; since without policing the voting system will be corrupted by criminals or other nations willing to use force.
1.5.3.4.1. Con: The necessity of using force to maintain a fair process and prevent externalities is not equal to using force to compel political action.
1.5.3.5. Pro: State as far as possible should refrain from 'forcing' anything. This is a principle of human rights, general liberty and necessary to protect minorities. Education, encouragement and increased facilitation should be undertaken.
1.5.4. Pro: Citizens count as [partial authors](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#2) of the law, even when they do not vote or participate in government.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Laws are written in the name of citizens, and can have serious - even immoral - consequences on the lives of people. Citizens therefore have a responsibility to vote to ensure that no unjust or immoral laws are passed in their name.
1.5.5. Pro: Citizens have a [moral duty](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#2) to prevent their representatives from committing injustice by voting them out of office.
1.5.5.1. Con: That moral duty only exists so far as an individual actually believes that their representative is committing injustices. If they believe that, they can \(and are likely to\) vote anyway under the system of optional voting.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: For example, if an individual is satisfied with the way that government is functioning, then this moral duty would not act upon them.
1.5.5.1.2. Con: This is a duty that applies, to at least some degree, prospectively. Individuals have a duty to vote to keep out those who are likely to - or have promised to - commit injustices. As elections are unpredictable, an individual can never be certain that their current representatives will not be defeated by those more likely to commit injustices, and so is obligated to vote each time.
1.5.6. Pro: Citizens already face certain responsibilities by living in a democratic state. For example, citizens are required to follow the law, pay taxes and serve on juries.
1.5.6.1. Pro: A citizen also has some responsibilities if they exercise the rights of that state. A citizen would have to act in collective interest of the state as a whole. If paying some taxes are compulsory, choosing who decides the tax rates should also be compulsory.
1.5.6.2. Con: These responsibilities are different because without them, the state cannot possibly function. Voting is different as an individual not voting does not threaten the state in its entirety.
1.5.6.2.1. Con: These responsibilities do not exist to allow the state to function, but instead to merely improve itself \(for example, taxes lead to wealth distribution\). An act that actively improves society without causing any harm is a responsibility that the state can impose on you.
1.5.6.2.2. Con: Not all states require jury duty, yet the states that don't are often still functioning. It therefore cannot be necessary for the state to function.
1.5.6.3. Pro: All these responsibilities are enforced because they help ensure that the state continues to function. Voting is no different, as we require governments to make decisions on our behalf.
1.5.7. Pro: Compulsory voting is a strong incentive for citizens to fulfill their duty, which is needed to prevent low turnouts.
1.5.7.1. Con: Strong incentive to vote is not equal to a strong incentive to vote reasonably and informedly.
1.5.7.2. Pro: Electoral participation is decreasing among younger generations \(for example, in the [US](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/10/economist-explains-24) or the [UK](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=sei-working-paper-no-92.pdf&site=266)\). When regular and older [voters](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jul/04/voterapathy.uk1) die, those new generations that do not see voting as a habit or a duty may diminish participation to even lower extremes.
1.5.7.2.1. Con: The US youth vote, while lower than the voting rate for all age groups, [has not actually decreased significantly more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_vote_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Voting_Trends_by_Race_and_Age.jpg) than the overall voter turnout has.
1.5.7.3. Pro: When there is a low voter turnout, it calls into question the legitimacy of the government and the laws that they make, as they are not actually mandated by the majority of all citizens.
1.5.7.3.1. Con: Election turnout has [decreased](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2014/140739/LDM_BRI\(2014\)140739_REV1_EN.pdf) in most G20 democracies since 1945, from around 80% to 60% today, and in some countries it does not even achieve 50%. This tendency has not called into question democracy around the globe.
1.5.7.3.2. Pro: If the voters do not engage with politics, not even bothering to [elect](http://www.ukpolitical.info/Turnout45.htm) their officials, this can increase bureaucrats' perception that [elections](https://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-institutions_government/power_inquiry_3310.jsp) are “a tiresome and increasingly insignificant interruption in its continuous exercise of power”.
1.5.7.3.3. Pro: When Bill Clinton was elected in 1996, the voter turnout was [only 51.2%](http://www.fairvote.org/voter_turnout#voter_turnout_101) and he received [less than 50%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1996) of the popular vote, meaning that only a quarter of eligible voters actually voted for him and his policies.
1.5.7.3.3.1. Con: Yet Bill Clinton finished his term as the 42nd President of the United States without his legitimacy being questioned or, at least, not due to the number of people who elected him.
1.5.7.3.3.1.1. Con: Just because Bill Clinton wasn't questioned does not mean other leaders whose voter turnout was low weren't.
1.5.7.3.3.1.2. Con: Some elections with a smaller turnout than the one of Bill Clinton, such as this one in [Alaska](http://www.newsminer.com/opinion/editorials/a-vote-of-no-confidence-in-alaska-low-voter-turnout/article_410d771c-29d2-11e4-99ca-0017a43b2370.html) with a turnout of 30%, get criticised for legitimacy.
1.5.7.4. Con: Low turnout is not necessarily negative, as there are potential differences between citizens' voting considerations, e.g. some choose based on political leaders’ rhetoric skills and physical appearance. Those voters influence the election based on superficialities \([Rosema, p. 622](https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/pa/staff/rosema/publications/rosema-2007-electoral-studies.pdf)\).
1.5.7.4.1. Con: This assigns more importance to the votes of some people than others. In a democracy, everyone's vote should count as equally legitimate, regardless of the reasons for the vote.
1.5.7.4.2. Con: The argument made in the article rests on the assumption that people vote based on reasons of 'minor importance'. However, it provides no evidence to illustrate how many non-voters would do this in the event that compulsory voting is imposed. Given this, it is safe to assume that while some people may cast votes based on reasons of 'minor importance', there will still be votes cast by people for reasons of 'major importance'.
1.5.7.4.2.1. Con: If usual voters may vote for [superficial](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100615105330.htm) [reasons](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/04/14/the-psychology-of-voting-digested/) it is likely that, even just statistically, a similar number of current non-voters will vote for the same shallow reasons.
1.5.7.5. Pro: At its highest, the voter turnout for presidential elections in the United States was only 63.8% in 1960.
1.5.7.5.1. Pro: With mandatory voting, the United States could finally compete with countries that have significantly larger voter turnout rates.
1.5.8. Con: Even if a citizen has a moral responsibility to vote, this doesn't mean that there's a legally enforceable duty to vote.
1.5.8.1. Con: Governments frequently take into account the morality of actions when designing the law. If there is a moral duty to do something, then this may well naturally extend to a legal duty as well.
1.5.9. Pro: Universal adult suffrage was fought for in various countries by people who were excluded on the basis of their identity. In order to respect their battles and assert our hard-won political rights, we must compulsorily vote in elections.
1.5.9.1. Con: That same suffrage allowed people not to vote if we choose too, why dishonor and disrespect that choice.
1.5.9.2. Con: People can be forced to vote, but not forced to think about their vote. Making an uninformed decision does not respect the actual reasons why activists fought for their right to vote.
1.5.9.3. Con: Activists and common people have also fought to acquire rights including same-sex marriage, abortion or divorce. Those battles were to obtain the right to do something if someone so chooses, not to make it an obligation.
1.5.9.3.1. Con: These were campaigns for the right to choose to do a thing - just as campaigns for voting were for the right to choose a government. As such, they are poor analogies - their expression is in the choice, whereas the right to vote is expressed not in the choice of whether to vote, but in the choice of who to vote for.
1.5.9.3.1.1. Con: The right to vote in a democratic society also extends to the right not to vote.
1.5.9.3.1.1.1. Pro: Compulsory voting is a contradiction in terms. Voting is to make a choice, compulsion decides for the voter and ends the democratic action.
1.5.9.3.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.5.9.3.1.1.2. Pro: Implementing this would require punishment for not voting. This would require knowing whether or not a person voted in any given race. This could be used to determine who the individual did vote for, which would violate anonymity.
1.5.9.3.1.1.3. Pro: Forcing citizens to vote against their will demeans popular sovereignty which is held in the United States.
1.5.9.3.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.2.
1.5.9.3.1.1.5. Pro: Citizens should only be "forced" to do something if it is necessary for the safety and protection of their fellow citizens and community, and some citizens choosing not to vote does not pose a safety concern to anyone. There may be moral reasons why everyone should vote, but that doesn't translate to it being reasonable to forcibly mandate it.
1.5.9.3.1.1.5.1. Con: Lack of participation of voters of a certain group can lead to its under representation in the state and less protection to it by such state, which is a safety concern.
1.5.9.3.1.1.6. Con: The right to not vote still deserves to be counted, because it is reflective of constituents' appreciation of the available political choices. This creates a trove of important data that helps political parties tackle broader issues, or issues that would not be brought forward if non-voters were simply dismissed.
1.5.9.3.1.1.7. Con: All rights and all duties in a democratic society exist because that democracy has decided that they should exist. There is no automatic extension from right of voting to right of not voting.
1.5.9.3.1.1.7.1. Con: If you don't have the right not to vote, then it's a duty, not a right.
1.5.9.3.1.1.8. Pro: A willing republican democratic system is better than a  forced democratic system.
1.5.9.3.1.1.9. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.5.9.3.1.1.10. Pro: The right to vote freely is the essence of a democratic society. To deny the right not to vote harms this important principle, as the vote can no longer be considered to be free.
1.5.9.3.1.1.11. Pro: The right not to vote has been recognized in [lower courts](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-right-vote-bulletproofing-course-action-before-you-burchart) in the USA.
1.5.9.3.1.1.11.1. Con: Forcing citizens to vote implies changing the law to enforce it, overriding previous laws and its interpretations.
1.5.9.3.1.1.12. Pro: In a "choose the lesser of two evils" situation the right not to vote is important, to relieve citizens of the responsibility of electing a bad government or nominee.
1.5.9.3.1.1.12.1. Con: Inaction is still an action in its own right.  Abstaining from the process makes you complicit with the outcome.
1.5.9.3.1.1.12.2. Con: There is no need to create a "lesser of two evils" situation. A voting can include a blank option, allowing everyone to participate without showing their support for either candidate.
1.5.9.3.1.1.12.3. Con: By relieving them of this responsibility, a greater of the two evils can be elected, leading to a worse situation for everyone.
1.5.9.3.1.1.12.3.1. Pro: Choosing the lesser evil, when ones options are only evils, is arguably the only moral decision to make. Abstaining risks the greater evil and makes the voter evil by complicity.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13. Pro: One of the most fundamental rights in a democratic society is the right to choose one's actions provided that they do not infringe on others.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.1. Pro: Any forcible law decreases personal freedom, which every democratic state should uphold and pushes the system further into totalitarianism and dictatorship. In order for the democratic system to function, people have to have a choice to vote freely, which means also the freedom not to vote.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.2. Pro: As voting is a personal choice, not voting only affects the individual, as they no longer have the representative that they want.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.7.3.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.3. Pro: A coercion to vote incapacitates citizens, whereas the right not to vote leaves the freedom of choice.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.6.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.3.2. Pro: Participation in the democratic process is considered to be a personal responsibility of citizens \(e.g. in the [USA](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learners/citizenship-rights-and-responsibilities)\). Coercion to vote eliminates this idea, which requires conscious decisions and [free will](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/), and turns citizens into subjects, as the choice is no longer upon them.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.4. Pro: As voting can be considered an expression of opinion and political communication, it is not digressive to regard it as speech, and the freedom of speech contains the right to be silent.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.4.1. Con: It is unclear why it is such an infringement on this right to remain silent if one can simply turn up to the polls and cast an informal vote. This is still protecting their right to be silent.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.4.2. Con: No right can be considered on its own; governments place restrictions on rights all the time for the benefit of society, such as banning hate speech. The question is not whether this limits free speech, but whether this restriction is justified.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.5. Pro: Compulsory voting fundamentally alters the act of voting. Where before it was a right - a protected liberty or permission to act - it now becomes an obligation entailing coerced action to comply with the law, file for exemption, or submit to legal penalties.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.5.1. Pro: In most jurisdictions across the globe, voting is not a duty but a [right](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/studyguides/votingrights.html). Therefore, even if rights come with responsibilities, people should be able to exercise them freely.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.5.1.1. Pro: Duties and rights are different matters. People are forced to comply with civic duties \(taxes, jury participation\), yet they should be able to decide if they want to exercise a [right](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2012/10/27/jacoby/PiV0sbV2bXf6OQAToXalxM/story.html) \(voting, marrying, striking or demonstrating\).
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.5.1.2. Con: Nothing prevents something from being both a right and a duty.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.5.2. Con: -> See 1.5.9.3.1.1.13.5.1.2.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.6. Pro: The reason that we value freedom is that the individual is best placed to know the value of their choice. Unless there is a tangible harm, the government should let them make that choice.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.6.1. Con: When it comes to democracy, we apply additional considerations beyond harm to other individuals. We also would not allow people to vote for an autocracy even if they thought it was best for them because it would be harming society as a whole.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.6.1.1. Con: In that instance the government is still legislating to avoid harm: not to others but to oneself or to society as a whole. Thus, democratic governments can limit people's actions, yet they should not restrict rights.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.6.1.1.1. Con: Laws of this kind are pretty much exclusively concerned with immediate physical harm or danger. This would not be the case for compulsory voting.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.6.1.2. Con: There has been a [rise](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-23/the-rise-of-elected-autocrats-threatens-democracy) in elected [autocrats](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/01/turkey-election-choice-democracy-autocracy-erdogan) in recent years. Thus democracy does indeed allow people to vote for undemocratic options.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.7. Con: Governments can legislate and limit people’s actions to avoid harm to others or to themselves - for example, by enforcing the use of seatbelts, banning drug use, or charging levies on those without health insurance.
1.5.9.3.1.1.13.7.1. Con: It is wrong to insist that an individual act in their own self-interest at the proverbial point of a gun.
1.5.9.3.1.1.14. Pro: Compulsory voting alters the nature of a government's relationship with its citizens from being one of voluntary association to more one of forced membership.
1.5.9.3.1.1.14.1. Pro: Compulsory voting undermines the awareness of a citizenry that democracy flourishes when the people take responsibility for their continued informed involvement and engagement, leading them to believe their obligations extend only as far as meeting their legal requirement to vote periodically.
1.5.9.3.1.1.14.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.9.3.1.1.13.5.
1.5.9.3.1.1.14.3. Con: Without compulsory voting, the relationship is still not wholly voluntary. For example, citizens are still required to perform civic duties such as paying taxes.
1.5.9.3.1.1.14.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.9.3.1.1.13.5.1.1.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15. Pro: Not voting can be a political action.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.1. Con: Not voting with the intention of making a political statement does nothing but ensure you \(and your statement\) are not heard.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.2. Con: Making voting mandatory could be paired with legal exemptions based on political, professional or religious ideas to respect everybody’s freedom.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.2.1. Pro: In the US, religious beliefs are a basis for exempting individuals from some mandatory activities.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.3. Pro: Not voting can be a way of protesting the inadequacy of existing political parties.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.3.1. Pro: Not voting sends a message of no-confidence or even contempt to those who run the political system.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.3.1.1. Con: This is not necessarily true. People don't vote for many [different](http://www.agreenroadjournal.com/2012/11/10-reasons-why-people-dont-vote-and-ten.html) reasons, including lines being too long or that they were simply too busy with their family and friends. Given this, there is no guarantee that a message of no-confidence or contempt will actually be sent to the political system.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.3.2. Con: An abstention under threat of financial penalty is a more powerful message of protest than one that is not, as an abstention with no penalty is as easily ascribed to apathy as it is to objection.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.3.2.1. Con: The power to send “a more powerful message of protest” is then only available to those who can afford the financial penalty, leaving those who cannot without the same option.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.4. Con: People can already be fined for engaging in some forms of protest \(for instance, being a public nuisance or damaging property\), yet some still do it. This is no different.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.4.1. Con: Punishing non-violent [anarchists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism#Post-classical_schools_of_thought) for their ideology is not the same as punishing protesters or people who actually break the law. This would be closer to undemocratic regimes trying to suppress the speech of their opponents.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.5. Con: By not voting, one is undermining the very fabric of democracy \(regardless of their intent\). It is unclear why someone should be able to do this without punishment.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.5.1. Pro: In a similar vein, we would not allow someone to steal from the rich \(because they believed in wealth distribution\) without punishment. These laws are put in place to protect our society.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.9.3.1.1.15.4.1.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.5.2. Con: There is a consensus that [political freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy) and freedom of speech are democratic principles. Therefore, to oppose democracy or demand direct democracy instead should not be punished in a [real](http://www.economist.com/node/8908438) democratic country, as long as these positions are defended peacefully and within the law.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.5.2.1. Con: There are plenty of ways of doing these things without failing to vote - just as someone can protest taxation without failing to pay their legally required taxes.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.6. Pro: People with other philosophical views on government, like anarchists, should have the right to not participate without being fined for their political ideas and actions.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.6.1. Con: We don't allow people to opt out of other government restrictions because they have different philosophical views \(laws, paying taxes\). It is unclear why this should be protected in any special way.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.6.1.1. Con: Laws and taxes are not matters of preference. Voting is a matter of preference. If a person has no preference, then forcing that person to vote devalues the votes of people who do have a preference.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.6.1.2. Con: If people were to break laws or not pay taxes in massive numbers, the result would be chaos. By contrast, large numbers of people refusing to vote does not cause chaos and public officials still get elected.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.6.1.3. Con: -> See 1.5.9.3.1.1.15.5.2.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.7. Pro: People who support direct democracy instead of representative democracy should have the right to not vote.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.7.1. Con: -> See 1.5.9.3.1.1.15.6.1.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.7.2. Con: Those who support direct democracy support more voter control over policy and government. It is unclear why they would therefore want to abstain from the existing forms of control they have, rather than vote consistently to demonstrate the ability to trust the populace to do so on important issues.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.8. Pro: People who support democracy, yet do not consider their actual country’s system fair \(i.e. because of counting systems, an exclusive two-party system or corruption\) should also have the right to not vote.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.8.1. Con: -> See 1.5.9.3.1.1.15.6.1.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.8.2. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.7.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.9. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.10. Pro: Not voting is a way to detract legitimacy and thus to weaken the political elites.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.10.1. Pro: If 50% or more of the eligible population doesn't vote, then even the winner of a two-party election can't claim a mandate.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.10.1.1. Con: Yet in many democracies around the globe, less than 50% of the eligible population votes and the winner still claims a mandate.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.10.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.7.3.3.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.9.3.1.1.15.3.1.
1.5.9.3.1.1.15.10.3. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.7.
1.5.9.3.1.1.16. Pro: Some religious groups \(e.g.: [Jehovah’s Witnesses](https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/political-neutrality/)\) believe they should not participate in political events. Making voting mandatory would limit their religious freedom.
1.5.9.3.1.1.16.1. Con: -> See 1.5.9.3.1.1.15.2.
1.5.9.3.1.1.16.2. Con: Where voting is mandatory, Jehovah's Witnesses consider themselves permitted to [attend the polls](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2008/06/why_dont_jehovahs_witnesses_vote.html).
1.5.10. Pro: It is unjust that [non-voters](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#2) benefit from the government they do not help to provide. Mandatory voting would cancel this injustice.
1.5.10.1. Pro: Non-voters save time and efforts they can invest somewhere else, thus placing themselves in an advantageous position compared to voters.
1.5.10.1.1. Con: If we think that voting, that is, contributing to the democratic system, is valuable, then perhaps voters are the ones who are advantaged in terms of societal power.
1.5.10.1.1.1. Con: On average, a voter in the US has a 1 in 60 million [chance](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/vote.pdf) of deciding the result of a presidential election. Thus an individual voter has very little chance to shape society according to their own interest.
1.5.10.1.1.1.1. Con: The marginal benefit of the vote to the individual may not be worth the costs, but the collective benefit to the society of everyone voting outweighs the collective cost of travelling to the polls, therefore making this a justifiable policy.
1.5.10.1.1.1.2. Con: The problem with this logic \(known as [Down's calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_voting)\) is that it ultimately shows that it is in every individual's interest not to vote. However, it does not take into account that if every person followed this, there would be no votes and hence no government which would go against every individual's interest.
1.5.10.1.1.2. Pro: Those who vote shape society according to their interests by choosing political parties and nominees.
1.5.10.1.2. Con: Given that voting is a short process which occurs once every few years, this advantage would be minuscule if it were even discernible.
1.5.10.1.3. Con: It is unclear why watching TV or sleeping - which some people will do instead of voting - for the few hours it will take to vote puts them in an advantageous position. Voting has a clear impact on the government that comes into power, and outweighs the temporary benefit of taking a nap.
1.5.10.2. Pro: A democratic system needs elections to survive; if all the population decided to save time and dedicate that time to other things, the system would collapse for rather selfish reasons.
1.5.10.3. Pro: Some people would rather spend their time on other things than jury duty or having to be in a polling station during elections, but those are obligations needed to maintain the system for everyone.
1.5.10.4. Con: People contribute to the government through taxes, not voting. Thus, provided people pay taxes, they are absolutely entitled to the benefits of government.
1.5.10.4.1. Con: There is a suite of ways that people contribute to government. Just because someone pays taxes does not mean they are given free rein to do as they please. Voting is an additional duty that they have.
1.5.10.5. Con: Citizens who vote against an implemented policy can still benefit from that policy. Not participating in the election of a government does not mean it is unjust to benefit from that government.
1.5.10.5.1. Con: There is a difference between voting against a party who implements a policy and not voting at all. At least when you vote, you are contributing to the representative democracy that you eventually profit from.
1.5.10.6. Con: By this logic, no-one who votes for a party other than those that form government should have a right to access government services - a position that would be wildly undemocratic, and place pressure on voters to vote against their own principles and interests.
1.5.11. Con: -> See 1.5.9.3.1.1.13.5.1.
1.5.12. Con: Only 21 countries in the world have some form of [compulsory voting](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2123.html). Many of the world's oldest democracies allow optional voting without having significant democratic failings \(e.g. the USA, UK\).
1.5.12.1. Pro: If compulsory voting were crucial to a country's functioning, the founders of many more countries would have included it in their constitutions.
1.5.12.1.1. Con: There are historical reasons why voting was not made compulsory. This is not a justification for perpetuating that position.
1.5.12.1.1.1. Pro: It was physically very difficult to get to polling booths in many places so forcing people to travel for a week for the purpose of voting would be unreasonably difficult.
1.5.12.1.1.2. Pro: Without any form of centralised system or technology, following up on those who did not vote would have been largely impossible.
1.5.12.1.1.3. Pro: Given that enfranchisement was almost never universal when countries were initially formed, it would have been incongruous to force all to vote when most of the population could not.
1.5.12.1.2. Con: This is an argument for never changing any law in society, as the founders would not have envisaged the need for it. [Decreasing voter turnouts](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/14/us-election-2016-voter-turnout-fell-to-58-per-cent-this-year-est/) is not something the founders would have predicted given that they had just established a democracy.
1.5.12.1.3. Con: Founders of any country were not perfect - just because they formed a particular constitution does not mean it is objectively the best one, and should never be improved upon.
1.6. Con: Punishing non-voters disproportionately targets poorer people in society who are unable to afford the fine.
1.6.1. Con: Governments have an incentive to make voting simpler, more accessible, and more available.
1.6.2. Con: Wealthier people are wealthier in part because they are engaged in socioeconomic and political processes. They are informed and more concerned about outcomes. It's unlikely that the wealthy would abstain in the first place.
1.6.3. Pro: Compulsory voting can increase political inequality by increasing turnout for some parties more than another depending on the type of punishment for not voting since the punishment will be more or less severe for certain people and therefor certain political parties.[Compulsory Voting Can Increase Political Inequality: Evidence From Brazil](http://www.mit.edu/~dhidalgo/papers/compulsory_voting.pdf)
1.6.4. Pro: Fining those who are most disillusioned with the political system, most often due to systemic abuse, only continues the cycle of abuse directed towards minorities by government.
1.6.5. Pro: An economic mechanism or nudge such as a tax break for proof of voting works much better than legally binding contracts. Therefore, citizens should be incentivized to vote, but not forced.
1.6.6. Pro: This grants the rich more choice as they can still choose not to vote \(and accept the fine without worry\), whereas a person who is poorer is unable to do this. A true democracy would provide the same level of choice to everyone in society.
1.6.6.1. Con: Not voting does not equate with having more political power, quite the opposite. For instance, in the status quo, low socio-economic status people vote less often, and we generally consider them to have less political power.
1.6.6.2. Con: Since low socio-economic status people vote less often in the status quo, this works to increase their political power, especially relative to the rich.
1.6.6.2.1. Con: With or without compulsory voting, poorer citizens are still able to vote. The only difference with compulsory voting is that they can't not vote while those who are richer can. In this way they have less power.
1.6.7. Con: The fine could certainly be proportional, minimizing the impact on poorer people.
1.6.8. Con: The idea of this policy is to shape behavior, and it presumably will result in almost everyone voting, meaning that very few if any people will actually pay the fine.
1.6.9. Pro: It can be difficult for many people to get to the polls and vote. Compulsory voting is an unfair burden on these people.
1.6.9.1. Pro: The majority of trans people in most countries face huge [difficulties](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/05/transgender-new-identification-gender-identifiers) and a long process in changing their legal gender markers and names on official documents and ID cards. Imposing a fine on them for not voting would be cruel and insensitive.
1.6.9.1.1. Pro: [Only 4%](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/02/05/a-majority-of-the-transgender-community-in-india-are-not-voting-in-elections/) of the trans population in India are registered as voters.
1.6.9.1.2. Con: Getting one's sex designation changed on an ID is one thing, but this bureaucratic process wouldn't stop the person from voting using the ID stating their assigned sex at birth in the meantime.
1.6.9.1.2.1. Con: For a large number of trans people, being forced to use an ID with their assigned sex at birth is [unjust](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/voter-id-laws-may-prevent-34000-trans-people-from-voting-on-tuesday) and [painful](http://www.citylab.com/politics/2016/04/how-id-laws-disenfranchise-transgender-voters/476511/). Moreover, in some [countries](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/world/americas/brazil-anti-gay-violence.html?_r=0), that would out them as trans and put them in [danger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unlawfully_killed_transgender_people#2016).
1.6.9.1.2.1.1. Con: It seems unlikely that the state will fine individuals for not voting when it is the state's fault for not providing them with the documentation required to vote.
1.6.9.1.2.1.2. Con: Trans individuals still have to use the same ID for other identification and bureaucratic purposes. The addition of one more, voting, is inconsequential.
1.6.9.1.2.1.3. Con: If this is a functional barrier to these people voting, then they are being deprived of their civil rights in the status quo. This is a far larger issue than an additional small fine, and so should be fixed rather than treated as a barrier to compulsory voting.
1.6.9.1.3. Con: -> See 1.6.9.1.2.1.3.
1.6.9.2. Con: It is possible to have forms of early voting and postal voting, which allow citizens to vote without physically attending a polling booth.
1.6.9.2.1. Pro: At the 2013 election in Australia, [27% of votes](http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Federal_Elections/2016/key-facts.htm) were received prior to election day \(including pre-poll, postal and mobile voting\).
1.6.9.2.2. Con: Not all democracies have a system in place to allow postal voting. India, a large country, does not currently have an absentee ballot system \(it is only [valid](https://education.onehowto.com/article/how-to-cast-vote-by-post-in-india-6116.html) for specific public servants\).
1.6.9.2.2.1. Pro: India’s Supreme Court has already asked the government to change the system to allow non-resident citizens to vote, thanks to [online](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/NRIs-can-now-vote-in-Indian-elections-without-coming-here/articleshow/45862058.cms) voting.
1.6.9.2.2.1.1. Con: [Only around 16,000 people](https://factly.in/overseas-indian-willing-vote-indian-elections-something/) are registered on the electoral roll as Overseas Indian electors though there are about 11.4 million non-resident Indians across the world.
1.6.9.2.2.2. Con: This is not inherent to voting systems. At the point at which compulsory voting is implemented, it is feasible to also implement changes which make the voting process more accessible.
1.6.9.2.2.2.1. Con: Either for [economic](http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1855717,00.html) reasons \(in a country like the US\) or because it helps [incumbent](http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/european-parliament-calls-on-spanish-government-to-review-voting-system-for-residents-abroad) politicians \(like in Spain\), implementing systems that guarantee all absentee voters can vote is expensive and difficult, as more and more people study or work abroad.
1.6.9.2.3. Con: In some countries like Spain \(where early voting in not allowed\) postal voting is so [inefficient](http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/european-parliament-calls-on-spanish-government-to-review-voting-system-for-residents-abroad) that many people, especially citizens abroad, are denied the right to vote.
1.6.9.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.9.2.2.2.
1.6.9.2.4. Con: [Early voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_voting) is only allowed in some countries. Therefore, for a large number of countries, changing their electoral systems would be time-consuming and politically and economically difficult.
1.6.9.2.4.1. Con: There are natural incentives to make this change anyway, given the way the workforce and society are developing. This just aids that change.
1.6.9.2.4.1.1. Pro: The assumption that people do not work on election day is less and less true as society transitions towards most companies operating all week. As a result, many people already struggle to make the polls and there is an incentive to change this.
1.6.9.2.4.1.1.1. Con: Politicians may not be motivated to bring a higher turnout of voters in areas that could hurt their election outcomes. If workers can't afford to take off, some politicians might prefer to fine them for not voting while reaping the benefits of one less vote for their opponents.
1.6.9.2.4.1.2. Pro: Given that people from all walks of society tend to be absent from a country during elections, there is always social pressure to allow absentee voting.
1.6.9.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: Globalisation, international mobility and unemployment encourage [migration](http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Pnada596.pdf) in developing and developed countries. Therefore, the number of absentee voters tends to increase.
1.6.9.2.4.1.2.1.1. Con: This assumes that those people vote when they leave their country and emigrate. At the point they choose to leave their country and seek a new life, they will often not vote in their country of origin.
1.6.9.2.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Information about this issue is difficult to gather, yet a comparative [study](http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Pnada596.pdf) shows turnout percentages from 20% to 65% among expatriate citizens in different countries. In the US, for example, 37% of non-federally employed US citizens living abroad voted in 2000.
1.6.9.2.4.1.3. Con: -> See 1.6.9.2.2.2.1.
1.6.9.2.4.2. Con: This means that changing their electoral system would be necessary, not that it would be costly or time-consuming. Indeed, spreading voting out over a greater number of days, or allowing postal votes, may ultimately reduce the human resources required to run an election, by avoiding over-capacity polling stations and requiring fewer total staff \(which reduces training and recruitment costs\).
1.6.9.2.5. Con: For various reasons \(including citizens abroad outnumbering, and therefore having a bigger impact on elections than local voters\), some countries \(like [Ireland](http://www.globalirish.ie/issues/emigrant-voting/)\) have never put in place a system of absentee voting. It is unlikely that they will because of implementing compulsory voting.
1.6.9.2.5.1. Con: You can implement a system of postal/absentee voting for those living in the country but unable to make it to the polls, without giving the right to vote to nationals living abroad.
1.6.9.2.5.2. Con: People that advocate changing the Irish system argue that only Irish-born nationals living abroad should vote, thus lessening the influence of the numerous people of Irish descent living abroad.
1.6.9.2.5.2.1. Pro: That is the case in many countries where nationals living abroad can vote, yet with time [limitations](https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/files/The_History_and_Politics_of_Diaspora_Voting.pdf). That way, second or third generations living abroad would not decide for the citizens living in the country.
1.6.9.3. Pro: Many countries are sparsely populated. It can be very difficult for many citizens to reach a polling booth when there is not one close to them.
1.6.9.3.1. Con: If polling booths are distributed in a way that makes it functionally logistically impossible for certain voters to cast their votes, they are being denied their right to vote in the status quo. This should be fixed, rather than treated as a barrier to compulsory voting.
1.6.9.4. Pro: It may be difficult to establish exceptions for high-priority/essential workers \(i.e. EMS, Police, Fire, Power-Plant operators, etc.\)
1.6.9.4.1. Con: -> See 1.5.9.3.1.1.15.2.
1.6.9.5. Con: If voting became compulsory, the authorities could arrange mass transportation to take people to voting locations.
1.6.9.5.1. Con: Some countries could have difficulty affording such policies, especially if they have a large population or are sparsely populated across remote and difficult to access areas.
1.6.9.5.1.1. Con: Cost should not be used as an argument against increasing democratic franchise. Governments are at their most truly legitimate when all citizens have an equal chance to vote, so this should be a primary priority for all countries.
1.6.9.6. Pro: Sick or disabled citizens need assistance, which could be an additional financial burden for them.
1.6.9.6.1. Con: Sick and disabled voters can vote by post, so there isn't the need to travel to the voting booths.
1.6.9.7. Pro: Homeless people have a [lower turn-out](http://www.may2015.com/ideas/why-homeless-people-dont-vote/) rate in elections.
1.6.9.7.1. Pro: The registration process is tough if you don't have a permanent address.
1.6.9.7.2. Pro: [They often feel](http://www.may2015.com/ideas/why-homeless-people-dont-vote/) their issues are not taken up by any political party or politician.
1.6.9.8. Con: In systems with mandatory voting \(e.g. Australia\), non-voters are given time to offer a [justification](http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/full_participation_web.pdf) before being fined. Therefore, reasons like sickness, mobility difficulties, registration or ID laws could be taken into account so people under those situations are not fined.
1.6.9.9. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.3.1.
1.6.10. Con: Mandatory voting does not necessarily need to be enforced by fines.
1.6.10.1. Con: Most options for punishment would still disproportionately harm poorer individuals in society as they are more reliant on government for their wellbeing.
1.6.10.1.1. Pro: Removing access to public services would drastically harm a poorer individual more than a richer one.
1.6.10.1.2. Pro: Disenfranchising poorer individuals would result in a future electorate that, on balance, cared about welfare programs to a lesser extent.
1.6.10.1.2.1. Pro: An electorate that cares less about welfare can give carte blanche to politicians to reduce welfare expenditure, without the parties affected being able to do anything about it, and thus resulting in a more unjust society.
1.6.10.1.2.2. Con: If the individuals disenfranchised are those who are consistently not voting, it is questionable how much of an impact that this will have.
1.6.10.1.2.3. Pro: In “use-it-or-lose it systems”, when voters do not vote for a long period of time they are removed from the electoral roll. This is the case in [Belgium](http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/full_participation_web.pdf) after not voting in at least four elections within 15 years.
1.6.10.1.2.3.1. Con: Yet in [Singapore](http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/full_participation_web.pdf), non-voters are removed from the electoral register and have to pay a fee to be reinstated or give a "valid and sufficient" reason. Therefore this system could still affect poorer voters more than richer ones.
1.6.10.1.3. Pro: After not voting in at least four elections within 15 years, voters get [excluded](http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/full_participation_web.pdf) from the voting rolls in Belgium. If that happens, it might be difficult to get a [job](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jul/04/voterapathy.uk) in the public sector.
1.6.10.1.4. Con: Formal reprimands or public notifications informing that a voter did comply with his or her democratic duty of voting may have social repercussions, yet not material ones that can harm lowest classes.
1.6.10.1.4.1. Con: If they don't have any material repercussions, then the penalties are unlikely to be a sufficient deterrent. This undermines the benefits of compulsory voting in the first place.
1.6.10.2. Pro: A tax credit could be given to those who vote. This rewards those who vote while providing a passive, indirect punishment for those who don't.
1.6.10.2.1. Con: This just cleverly disguises the use of force, as more must logically be taken from non-voters, or another source. The force merely occurs at a less noticeable point in the timeline.
1.6.10.3. Pro: Formal reprimands, name-and-shame systems or the loss of public services can also be non-pecuniary [options](http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/full_participation_web.pdf).
1.6.10.4. Con: Brazil, the largest country with compulsory voting, uses non-monetary [sanctions](http://www.mit.edu/~dhidalgo/papers/compulsory_voting.pdf) \(which forbid the use of estate services that are important for middle and upper classes, yet not that vital for low-income classes who do not generally use them\). In this case, compulsory voting does not reduce unequal turnout due to the nature of the relevant incentive and may even increase it.
1.6.10.4.1. Con: This seems to be largely caused by the choice of sanctions, rather than compulsory voting itself. This could be relatively easily fixed by choosing more appropriate sanctions.
1.6.10.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.1.2.3.
1.6.11. Pro: The cost to vote is generally greater for those who are poorer as they often have to work or cannot afford to attend the booths.
1.6.11.1. Con: In a large number of [countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_day), election day is on a Sunday, traditionally a non-working day in those countries. Applying that logic, the costs for the economy or individuals would not be that high.
1.6.11.1.1. Con: Given the number of shops and services that still function on the weekend, many people \(often those who desperately need the money\) still work on these days. Compulsory voting would still be a hardship for these people, whereas the status quo gives them the option of not voting.
1.6.11.1.1.1. Con: Several [countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_shopping), especially those with Catholic traditions, still regulate opening hours and limit the opening on Sundays.
1.6.11.1.1.2. Con: In many cases, it is the small shops that fight to have a closing day to rest, as they cannot compete with big retailers.
1.6.11.1.1.3. Con: If there are fulltime workers who cannot take a single day off without suffering serious hardship, the problem lies with minimum wage laws and the welfare system.
1.6.11.1.2. Pro: Even if there are shops and services that are open on Sundays, a lot of office-based jobs are not. Therefore, placing elections on Sundays would still have a smaller impact on the economy.
1.6.11.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.3.1.
1.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.
1.8. Con: In countries with a lack of diversity in their political arena, compulsory voting is especially problematic as citizens might not find a representative who shares their views. They would thus be forced to vote for a candidate they don't support.
1.8.1. Con: A lack of diversity in the political arena could imply a lack of diversity in the voting public about political issues. It's debatable that this would even be a bad thing.  It;s better for democracy if the majority as opposed to the plurality held the same values.
1.8.2. Pro: The willingness to vote is dependent on a candidate who reflects most if not all of the individual voter's beliefs. Bereft of that, the right to abstain should be available to everyone, just as it is in Parliament.
1.8.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.2.
1.8.3. Pro: Casting a vote against a candidate, if allowed in an election, would be counted as having indicated a desire not to allow the election of that candidate, but if the voter's wish is neither to express approval nor disapproval any candidates in a given election, then coercing that voter to cast a vote for or against a candidate may be counting support or opposition where it does not exist, effectively invalidating the results of such an election.
1.8.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.8.3.2. Con: There can be space for [write-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-in_candidate) candidates.
1.8.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.4.
1.8.3.3. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.2.
1.8.4. Pro: Casting a vote for a candidate in an election is counted as having indicated approval of electing that candidate, but if the voter's wish is not to approve any of the listed candidates then coercing that voter to cast a supportive vote for a candidate is counting support which does not exist thereby invalidating the results of such an election.
1.8.4.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.2.1.1.
1.8.4.2. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.8.4.3. Con: -> See 1.8.3.2.
1.8.4.4. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.2.
1.8.4.5. Pro: The number of non-voters gives us some idea of the value of elections generally and not just the value of one particular election.
1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.8.3.2.
1.8.6. Pro: Sometimes people have good reasons not to vote under certain circumstances, such as when they only know of candidates they want not to represent them but there is no option to vote directly against a candidate. Forcing them to vote doesn't fix such problems but rather helps to hide such problems thereby preventing them from being addressed at all.
1.8.7. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.2.
1.8.8. Con: This is often the case in countries with voluntary voting systems as well.
1.8.8.1. Pro: The only difference with compulsory voting is that there exists a greater incentive for diversity because everyone has to vote and therefore will look for representatives who mirror their views.
1.8.8.2. Con: While this is true, there is no necessity to vote without mandatory voting. So in these systems, you don't have to vote for a candidate you do not like.
1.8.9. Con: If there is a large enough group of citizens that believe in a certain set of policies, it is likely that those citizens will find a representative, either by making new political parties or by politicians catering to those policies to gain votes.
1.8.9.1. Pro: Compulsory voting would force politicians to engage with these groups.
1.8.9.1.1. Con: Regardless of voting being compulsory, politicians can still pay more attention to those areas with more indecisive voters and thus more able to swing the final result.
1.8.9.1.1.1. Con: Some safe seats are safe because the majority of people who turn out to vote do so for one particular party. This may no longer be the case if everyone has to vote, so politicians will be forced to pay more attention to previously ignored safe seats.
1.8.9.1.2. Con: Politicians can still pay more attention to more populated areas, as they have more votes to offer - even more so with compulsory voting.
1.8.9.1.2.1. Con: Populated areas don't have homogenous political populations. Compulsory voting will force politicians to engage with every group, or with as many as possible, rather than just one group in the city. This increases the total number of people being engaged with by politicians, regardless of whether they are in populous areas or not.
1.8.9.2. Con: With compulsory voting, there is no need for politicians to be appealing. Instead, they just need to be better than their opponents, as citizens are forced to decide between them.
1.8.9.2.1. Pro: This leads to very negative campaigning since if you can show your opponent to be very flawed, then people are more likely to vote for you.
1.8.9.2.1.1. Con: The [basis](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/23098/1/Compulsory_voting\(LSERO\).pdf) of [negative](http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/27/13434246/donald-trump-targeted-dark-facebook-ads-black-voters) campaigns is to discourage your opponent's potential voters from going to vote. With mandatory voting that cannot be the case, therefore resulting in less negative campaigning.
1.8.9.2.1.1.1. Con: Negative campaigning, by portraying the other candidates as worse, can still benefit the one carrying out negative campaigning, as they are seen as better politicians relative to their opponents.
1.8.9.2.2. Pro: Compulsory voting masks the fact people hate their voting system. Imagine a company that holds a crappy Christmas party every year so turnout is low. Instead of improving the party to increase participation they just force everyone to come. The party is still crappy but turnout is high and the company sees it as a success.
1.8.9.2.3. Con: Being too bad might lead to protests and revolution to the system.
1.8.9.2.4. Con: One way of being better than your opponents is by having better policies than them. Competition over better policies still exists. All that has changed is that more people will vote.
1.8.9.2.5. Con: The current system of voluntary voting in the US didn't prevent one of the [most unpopular candidates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/21/the-last-presidential-candidate-who-was-as-unpopular-as-donald-trump-david-duke/?utm_term=.2f78503954cb), Donald Trump, from winning the 2016 [presidential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016) election.
1.8.9.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.1.1.1.
1.8.9.2.6. Con: Citizens still have the option of an invalid vote or to pay the fine; thus, a minimal level of appeal is definitely still required.
1.8.9.2.7. Con: Mandatory voting is independent of the voting system. In [multiparty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_system) systems with proportional representation there can many different options. If each candidate who gets votes can get some degree of representation, politicians still have to be appealing and compete against each other.
1.8.9.2.7.1. Pro: For example, the Italian [Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Parliament) has nine political parties, without counting several others with less representation that are in the [mixed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_Group) group.
1.8.9.2.8. Pro: Political parties will have no motivation to improve voter turnout, and will opt against offering inspiring candidates with disruptive ideas.
1.8.9.2.8.1. Con: Inspiring candidates will also have a better chance of picking up a majority of voters.
1.8.9.2.9. Con: To the extent to which this is true, it is true with voluntary voting, where there is no minimum turnout required for an election to be valid.
1.8.9.2.10. Con: In jurisdictions with plurality \(as opposed to majority\) vote, this is already the case. When the polls close, whoever has the more votes, not the majority of votes, is the victor. This is a problem of the non-transferable, single-vote voting system.
1.8.10. Pro: A lack of diversity is often inherent to a system and difficult to change.
1.8.10.1. Pro: Running for election can be expensive, and thus those who are less privileged can be locked out.
1.8.10.1.1. Pro: Running for election is very time-consuming, which means it is difficult to maintain a job at the same time. In this way, the indirect costs are very large.
1.8.10.1.2. Pro: Political parties tend to favour social elites, as these are the people with the greatest connections and access.
1.8.10.1.2.1. Con: This is far more true in countries without effective campaign finance regulations to limit political donations and spending, or substitute state funding for campaigns. Countries with those regulations largely do not experience these problems on nearly the same scale.
1.8.10.1.3. Pro: In many countries, candidates must compete through political advertisements, often at great expense. Many candidates end up [covering significant amounts of that funding themselves](https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topself.php?cycle=2016), particularly in the early stages of a campaign.
1.8.10.2. Pro: A high rate of reelection for incumbents means that power tends to be entrenched among traditionally powerful groups.
1.8.10.2.1. Pro: Between 1982 and 2006, [95%](http://cstl-cla.semo.edu/rdrenka/ps103/Spring2010/congressional_incumbency.htm) of incumbents who sought reelection in the US House of Representatives were duly returned.
1.8.10.2.2. Con: A high rate of reelection does not necessarily mean this at all - if the people initially being elected are diverse, this simply means a diverse set of people are being reelected.
1.8.11. Con: Countries that have compulsory voting could move to a system of proportional representation \(if they don't already have it\). Unlike the winner-take-all system, this would lead to numerous, diverse political parties.
1.8.11.1. Con: Proportional representation only shifts the level of government to which the same exact issues will be observed: Those under-represented have a smaller voice.
1.8.11.2. Con: It is highly unlikely that the dominant political actors will let this happen, as this would come with great loss of power and influence.
1.8.11.3. Con: Such a move is not easy to undertake, as this means changing large parts of the constitution and the role of the political institutions, which requires a great majority in parliament.
1.8.11.3.1. Con: Implementing compulsory voting would similarly be difficult and would require large changes in the political landscape. There is no reason the two cannot be done together.
1.8.12. Pro: 27% of [non-voters in the US](http://nonvotersinamerica.com) are disappointed by the candidates and thus do not vote. This significant fraction would be forced to vote for candidates that they do not really support.
1.8.12.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.8.13. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.8.9.2.
1.10. Pro: Compulsory voting reduces corruption in elections.
1.10.1. Con: When people are forced to vote while feeling that only the corrupt candidates they know of have any chance to win, this often results in more votes for corrupt candidates, thereby increasing the effectiveness of corruption.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Forcing people to vote could cover up situations where all candidates who seem to have a reasonable chance to win are strongly suspected of corruption.
1.10.1.2. Pro: Mandatory voting would guarantee that even in extreme cases of rampant corruption there would still be a high turnout of voters casting votes for those corrupt candidates.
1.10.1.3. Pro: Low voter turnout should act as a valuable indicator that something is wrong and merits investigation into why people are choosing not to vote.
1.10.1.4. Pro: As long as people are only allowed to cast positive votes indicating approval of electing one of the available candidates, the lack of finding any good candidates to choose from is decent reason not to vote.
1.10.1.5. Pro: Increased effectiveness of corruption is more likely to increase corruption in politics rather than decrease it.
1.10.1.6. Pro: Masking dissent against corruption is more likely to increase corruption in politics rather than decrease it.
1.10.2. Con: If people are forced to vote, they might be more inclined to sell their votes for the candidate that best offers objective and direct support to their immediate needs \(i.e. provide food or shelter out of candidate's own pockets\) and not via public policies. It is more likely to exist a commerce of votes in a situation where the citizen cannot simply not vote.
1.10.3. Pro: Often, those who are most disgusted by corruption end up [disengaging](http://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/file/DP8790.pdf) from politics. Now when they have to vote, they are likely to vote out the corrupt party, providing deterrence for corruption.
1.10.3.1. Con: Those who have disengaged from politics are not necessarily going to vote against the corrupt party.
1.10.3.1.1. Pro: Disengagement can be because of many factors, such as disillusionment with the system as a whole, or a general lack of interest \(which does not generally lend itself to voting one way or the other\).
1.10.3.1.2. Pro: Disengaged voters may not care enough to become engaged, which can lead to invalid votes or votes based on irrelevant factors \(such as who their parents vote for\).
1.10.3.2. Con: It is unlikely that a group of disaffected non-voters would have a large impact on the results of an election.
1.10.3.2.1. Con: Given that voting rates hover around 50% in many countries, compulsory voting would almost double the electorate. This could have a dramatic impact on the composition of the government.
1.10.3.2.2. Con: While this may be true of national elections, voting in regional and local elections is as important as national elections , and smaller-scale elections are more easily affected by individual voters or smaller voting blocs.
1.10.3.3. Pro: The lowest social classes are [hurt](http://www.eldis.org/vfile/upload/1/document/0708/DOC14285.pdf) the most by corruption and they are also the group with the [lowest](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/23098/1/Compulsory_voting\(LSERO\).pdf) electoral participation. Therefore, mandatory voting would mobilize those citizens to vote against corruption.
1.10.3.3.1. Con: Poor people with limited education are rather easy victims of manipulation. Corrupt politicians can take advantage of this.
1.10.3.3.1.1. Pro: Ignorant or [uninformed citizens](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yoani-sanchez/from-information-to-actio_b_8546858.html) are easy victims of manipulation and control. As a consequence, demagogues and populists could profit from compulsory voting.
1.10.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: Populism hurts liberal democracies.
1.10.3.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Populists claim](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/17/problem-populism-syriza-podemos-dark-side-europe) to own the truth and as a consequence argue that all the others are wrong. As democracy is about pluralism, there cannot be one truth.
1.10.3.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Populist parties are no exceptions in having highly critical views of their opponents. The radical left is equally deaf towards neoliberal arguments, but this does not hurt democracy.
1.10.3.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: The situations in [Hungary and Venezuela](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/17/problem-populism-syriza-podemos-dark-side-europe) show what happens when populists take full control of a country - they undermine the system of checks and balances of the liberal democracy, invent new institutions and distribute important positions to loyal supporters instead of the most competent persons. These measures hinder democracy.
1.10.3.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: This is correlation over causation. There is no reason why this necessarily occurs with populists nor why this cannot happen without populists.
1.10.3.3.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: In other countries, such as Austria under [Haider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rg_Haider), populist parties have not undermined the democratic state.
1.10.3.3.1.1.1.3. Con: Populists are usually not part of the [political establishment](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/17/problem-populism-syriza-podemos-dark-side-europe), its network and dependencies. Their political power is mostly based on their popularity among the citizens. As a result populists can perform as a strong opposition, attack the government without fearing many consequences and bring otherwise ignored issues into the political process.
1.10.3.3.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Yet, when populists do actually get into a position of power, they have great potential to do harm.
1.10.3.3.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.3.3.1.1.1.2.
1.10.3.3.1.1.1.4. Con: [Populism brings](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/17/problem-populism-syriza-podemos-dark-side-europe) to the fore issues that large parts of the population care about, but that the political elites want to avoid discussing, thus it can be considered as democratic.
1.10.3.3.1.1.1.5. Con: Populism is not inherently negative; there is no reason why populism cannot promote ideas that are worthy of being promoted. What some perceive as dangerous populism is democracy at work to others.
1.10.3.3.1.1.1.6. Con: Populist parties can be voted out of office if the electorate wishes.
1.10.3.3.1.1.1.6.1. Con: While this is true, it forgets the damage the populists can do in the short term while they are in power.
1.10.3.3.1.1.1.7. Pro: Populism often relies on narratives of "overcoming the system" and "just getting things done". When faced with systems of checks and balances causing delay, populists often find themselves under political pressure to just brush away regulations and restrictions on government power, and are more likely to be inclined to do so as a result of their populist ideology.
1.10.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: Large parts of the [British public](https://www.rt.com/uk/346342-brexit-voters-ignorance-misinformation/) had a misguided perception of the EU, mainly due to ignorance and misinformation, and thus voted to leave.
1.10.3.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Interested and informed voters could have easily found out that the populists' [numbers](https://www.rt.com/uk/346342-brexit-voters-ignorance-misinformation/) and "facts" about the EU were wrong.
1.10.3.3.1.2. Pro: In the [USA](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/howard-steven-friedman/americas-poverty-education_b_1826000.html) there is a strong link between poverty and a lack of education.
1.10.3.3.1.3. Con: Being poor does not mean being low-educated and manipulable, as the link between income and education will highly depend on the education policies in a given country. Countries with a strong welfare state and a high-achieving [public education](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/27/best-education-in-the-wor_n_2199795.html) system can guarantee educated citizens regardless of their income.
1.10.3.4. Con: [Anti-establishment parties](http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_and_inequality_how_populists_mislead_people) or politicians that claim to eliminate corruption fail miserably to address - and often significantly increase - corruption. Therefore, compulsory voting could actually increase corruption.
1.10.3.4.1. Con: If the politician increases corruption, they will be voted out in the next election, until eventually someone capable of eliminating corruption is voted in.
1.10.3.4.2. Con: This harm exists without compulsory voting as well, where engaged voters could vote for someone who is either incapable of eliminating or wants to increase corruption. No additional harm is created by compulsory voting.
1.10.3.4.3. Con: The article discusses populist leaders, not leaders seeking to tackle corruption generally. As such, it is poor evidence that mass voting against corrupt parties will not reduce corruption.
1.10.3.4.3.1. Con: When corruption is systemic, it is likely that only leaders claiming to be outsiders or not part of the establishment can convince people to vote for them to eradicate it. Most of them could be labelled as populists.
1.10.3.5. Con: This is not an effective way of combating corruption. The limited information about corrupt activity makes it very hard to identify corrupt officials or parties and to vote them out of office.
1.10.3.5.1. Pro: Even in countries with a very good international corruption index ratings from the ESO \(Expert Group on Public Finance\), like [Sweden](http://www.mollwenden.se/en/articles/hidden-corruption-the-illusion-of-the-corruption-free-country/), there is hidden corruption \(as national studies suggest\). As even experts fail to uncover all sorts of corruption, it is unlikely that citizens would be able to.
1.10.3.5.2. Con: While citizens may not be aware of all the corruption that is taking place, they can still vote based on the information they have.
1.10.3.5.2.1. Pro: The degree of awareness of corruption depends on the country in question. While it may be the case that some effectively hide their corruption, corruption is often a major issue in politics in countries like [India](http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/india). It is also discussed by the public.
1.10.3.5.3. Con: Transparency International publishes an annual [Corruption Index](https://www.transparency.org/country/) that lists the countries in the world by the degree of corruption that occurs. Clearly there is some information about this present.
1.10.3.5.3.1. Pro: They also publish a [Corruption Perception Index](http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016), which tracks how much corruption people think is occurring in any given country.
1.10.3.5.3.2. Con: The Corruption Index only considers the overall corruption of a country and not that of parties or individuals.
1.10.3.5.4. Con: Mandatory voting reduces the ability of politicians to corrupt elections through "[turnout buying](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/div-classtitlevote-buying-or-turnout-buying-machine-politics-and-the-secret-ballotdiv/550A40E8B9C692AC2FB7EBB4676B7EAB#)", where they offer incentives or benefits to their supporters or opponents to affect who turns out to vote.
1.10.3.5.4.1. Pro: If voting is voluntary and consequences of voting aren't, there's a power and class divide between those who vote and those who don't. The voting faction is incentivized to maximize this advantage by discouraging voting. Voluntary voting therefore necessarily encourages voter suppression.
1.10.3.5.5. Con: If corruption occurs via vote-buying, with a mandatory system the number of votes to buy is much higher and, therefore, the real chances of swinging an election through corruption decreases.
1.10.3.5.5.1. Con: Mandatory voting may incentive selling votes. Making voting mandatory will force people to make a choice, since choosing in something they don't care about but have to do anyway, many can consider gaining some money by selling their vote.
1.10.3.5.5.2. Pro: Thailand introduced [compulsory](https://www.psa.ac.uk/insight-plus/beyond-turnout-consequences-compulsory-voting) voting in 1997, precisely to reduce [corruption](http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/full_participation_web.pdf) \(especially vote-buying\).
1.10.3.5.5.2.1. Con: Yet the system seems to remain corrupt, as demonstrations in 2011 show. Organisations encouraged people to vote “[NO](http://thediplomat.com/2011/06/thailands-vote-no-campaign/)” at the ballots to protest the corrupt system. As voting is mandatory, this option remains the only way to protest without consequences.
1.10.3.5.5.2.1.1. Con: Corruption is one of a number of things you take into consideration when voting. Compulsory voting simply makes it more likely that corruption will be eliminated, not that it will almost certainly be eliminated.
1.10.4. Con: Different demographics care differently about corruption as an electorally decisive issue. Evidence suggests that [older people](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10818-006-9003-0) and [women](https://globalanticorruptionblog.com/2016/03/15/does-compulsory-voting-increase-or-decrease-corruption-preliminary-thoughts/) are more likely to care about corruption. If compulsory voting increases the turnout of demographics that don't consider corruption as an important issue, there is no increased incentive to get rid of it.
1.10.4.1. Con: This obviously depends on the level of corruption. The more corrupt a government is, the more chance that compulsory voting could have an impact.
1.10.5. Pro: [Countries](http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/case-compulsory-voting) with mandatory voting tend to have higher rankings in democracy satisfaction indexes and lower rankings in [corruption](https://books.google.es/books?id=49CuCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT159&lpg=PT159&dq=compulsory+voting+corruption&source=bl&ots=jWZN-0849W&sig=_Fi-qqmRbv3dm4Sn7zBnGRyRRBY&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=compulsory%20voting%20corruption&f=false) perception indexes.
1.10.5.1. Con: In Brazil, voting is compulsory, nevertheless it has [high levels of corruption](https://www.transparency.org/country/BRA).
1.10.5.1.1. Con: One example does not disprove a broader trend. Other factors may be at play here, and it is entirely possible that Brazil would have an even higher corruption level without compulsory voting.
1.10.5.1.2. Con: In Brazil voting is voluntary for [illiterate](http://www.mit.edu/~dhidalgo/papers/compulsory_voting.pdf) individuals, that means that for [10%](http://en.mercopress.com/2011/04/30/brazilian-has-190.7-million-population-and-14.6-million-illiterates) of the population \(around 14 million\) voting is actually not mandatory.
1.10.6. Con: -> See 1.10.3.5.
1.10.7. Con: Disaffected or apathetic voters forced to vote are susceptible to having their votes bought.
1.10.7.1. Pro: Bought or picked at random to fulfill the requirement.
1.10.7.2. Pro: If you don't care about your vote, it has less value to you and you would be willing to sell it for less.
1.10.8. Pro: -> See 1.10.3.5.4.
1.10.9. Pro: -> See 1.10.3.5.5.
1.11. Pro: Voting is in an individual's self-interest.
1.11.1. Con: That is true only if the options one is compelled to choose from contain at least one that is in the voter's self-interests.
1.11.2. Con: Sometimes, but not always. While voting is often in an individual's self-interest as well as the collective interest of society, it's also true that sometimes not voting is in some other individual's self-interest and perhaps also in the collective interest of society. An individual should be allowed to elect not to vote, elect to vote in support, or elect to vote in opposition. Nobody should be able to decide which on another person's behalf and coerce the individual to accept that imposition.
1.11.3. Con: Self-interest erodes in a system where many voters feel disenfranchised by a system that appears to serve only a few.
1.11.4. Con: Removing the citizen's power to decide whether he votes or not is not in the citizen's self-interest.
1.11.5. Con: If people vote for a politician based on campaign promises and then the politician does not follow through, or even does the opposite, the result of that vote goes against the voter’s interest.
1.11.5.1. Con: Politicians can be incentivised to follow their campaign promises through the threat of being voted out of office.
1.11.5.2. Pro: It is not unusual for voters to re-elect politicians who previously broke campaign promises and otherwise violated voters' trust. Therefore, voters did not act on their self-interest.
1.11.5.2.1. Con: Even if a politician did not fulfill his or her promises or violated the voters' trust, voters can still act on their self-interest by re-electing them instead of other candidates they deem worse.
1.11.5.2.1.1. Pro: Ultimately, it is highly unlikely that any candidate will perfectly represent every single opinion of a voter. This decision makes perfect sense.
1.11.5.3. Con: While this may be a risk of choosing a representative, this risk is greater when you let other people choose a representative for you - a representative who may well still violate their promises, but also may have a driving ideology and approach even further from the voters' preferences.
1.11.6. Con: However, there are also costs associated with voting. The likelihood that a single vote affects an election is minuscule, so it is better to allow an individual to weigh up that benefit against the costs.
1.11.6.1. Con: While this is true, a large number of potential voters making the same decision to abstain from voting can have a large effect on the outcome of the election.
1.11.6.1.1. Pro: Voter turnout in the US, for example, has [recently hovered around the 45-55% mark in Presidential elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections), and is [significantly lower for mid-term elections.](http://time.com/3576090/midterm-elections-turnout-world-war-two/)
1.11.6.2. Pro: [The paradox of voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_voting) : the costs of voting will normally exceed the expected benefits. Most exemplary the cost of a vote in political donations tends to be in the single dollar range, such that spending the time it takes to vote earning money to donate to a cause has a greater political impact than using that time to vote.
1.11.6.3. Con: If we make election day a holiday, then most of these costs go away.
1.11.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.3.1.1.
1.11.6.3.2. Con: Some costs are constant, such as the necessity to travel to the polls and the time it requires to do so. Given that the individual benefits are marginal, this is still often not worth it.
1.11.6.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.10.1.1.1.1.
1.11.6.3.3. Pro: In [Indonesia](http://jakartaglobe.id/news/legislative-election-day-declared-public-holiday/), one of the world's largest democracies, legislative election day has been declared a public holiday, so that citizens can fully concentrate on voting and are not burdened with work.
1.11.6.3.4. Con: Adding an additional holiday will impose harms on the economy.
1.11.6.3.4.1. Con: Keeping polls open for two days and having consecutive holidays \(adding one more\) would make it possible for businesses to stay open both days, by scheduling their employees appropriately.
1.11.6.3.4.2. Pro: Few employees work the entirety of any day. There is plenty of time in a single day to make it to a polling office.  Scheduling such a day of work on a voting day is between the voting employee and their employer.
1.11.6.3.4.3. Con: Voting by mail or through the internet doesn't require an additional day off.
1.11.6.3.4.4. Con: -> See 1.6.11.1.
1.11.6.3.4.5. Con: The relative impact of one fewer day of work, once every few years, is nearly imperceptible.
1.11.6.3.4.6. Pro: There are already enough public holidays in the year without adding one more.
1.11.6.3.4.6.1. Con: There is no reason why one of the current holidays can't be moved to accommodate the election.
1.11.6.3.4.7. Pro: Having to close shop on election day may have prohibitive costs for a lot of businesses, especially small ones.
1.11.6.3.4.7.1. Con: Smaller businesses have fewer employees to accommodate, less overhead to cover, and more than likely shorter hours to begin with.
1.11.6.3.4.7.2. Con: If any business is so small that allowing 2 extra hours off to each employee once every few years will cause it to fail, it was already at the point of failure.

If this is considered to be a problem, then an existing public holiday can be cancelled or used as polling day.
1.11.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.11.
1.11.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.10.1.1.1.
1.11.6.6. Pro: The state with the highest probability that one vote changes the outcome in a Presidential election in the USA has a probability of 1 in 10 million \([Gelman, Silver, Edlin, p. 324](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/probdecisive2.pdf)\).
1.11.7. Pro: As modern democracy means rule for the people as well as guaranteed basic liberties, it is in the very interest of every individual to vote, as voting is necessary to keep this political system alive.
1.11.7.1. Con: It's not clear that voting is required to keep the political system alive. Even if no one at all voted, there would still be election winners because this occurrence would result in a zero-to-zero tie, and governments [have rules](https://what-if.xkcd.com/19/) for [handling tie votes](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-2014-elections-that-ended-in-a-tie/).
1.11.7.1.1. Con: Even if the whole political system did not collapse, the government would be paralysed with inaction as they would have no popular mandate to implement any changes. This would render them effectively non-existent.
1.11.7.2. Pro: A democracy needs its citizens to be politically active, conventionally or unconventionally. If all citizens behave like subjects, the power of political elites increases and democracy is harmed.
1.11.7.2.1. Pro: Elections hold political leaders accountable and prevent them from misusing their power.
1.11.7.2.2. Pro: [Incumbents](https://www.princeton.edu/csdp/events/Trounstine020509/Trounstine020509.pdf) \(Trounstine, p. 8\) are more likely to win in elections with lower turnouts, thereby entrenching the power of existing elites.
1.11.7.2.2.1. Pro: [Left unchecked](http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_and_inequality_how_populists_mislead_people), political institutions become undermined and governments overwhelmingly serve the interests of economic elites.
1.11.7.2.2.2. Pro: New parties and candidates \(like Katter’s Australian Party\) often lack wealthy backing. As a result, they can't contest elections without spending large sums of money in order to get voters to polling booths. By requiring everyone to vote, smaller parties can be competitive, keeping the political system responsive to the populace.
1.11.7.2.2.3. Con: The incumbent [Labor Party](https://www.psa.ac.uk/insight-plus/beyond-turnout-consequences-compulsory-voting) supported compulsory voting in Australia to guarantee that the turnout of their supporters could match that of the better funded Liberal National Coalition. Therefore, compulsory voting helped the incumbent party in this instance.
1.11.7.2.2.3.1. Con: This would only hold true if the incumbent party thought that a majority of non-voters would vote for them rather than any other opposition party, which is not necessarily the case.
1.11.7.2.2.3.2. Pro: A study of compulsory voting in Australia \(implemented in 1924\) estimates that when voting was voluntary, only 44% of voters supported Labor. However, when voting became mandatory, 78% of previous non-voters supported Labor \([Fowler, p. 25](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11156810/Fowler_gsas.harvard_0084L_10773.pdf?sequence=1)\).
1.11.7.2.2.3.2.1. Con: Even though the study is based on previous research, historical information and mathematical models, it also includes the possibility that the changes in Australia were caused by factors other than compulsory voting.
1.11.7.2.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: One explanation would be that at the precise moment compulsory voting was being implemented, there was already increasing support for Labor.
1.11.7.2.2.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Were this the case, we would expect to see increased support among those who were already voters as well. Given this is not the case, this seems implausible.
1.11.7.2.2.3.2.1.2. Pro: Compulsory voting might have changed electoral outcomes for reasons other than higher turnout: for example, by changing partisan attitudes.
1.11.7.2.2.3.2.1.3. Pro: Additionally, implementation may have just coincided with important demographic changes.
1.11.7.2.2.3.3. Con: This is a context-specific example, and is isolated to the very specific context of the relevant parties. It is equally worth observing that the Australian Labor Party continued to support compulsory voting in opposition, for the same reason, and that it then - at least by this logic - favoured the opposition.
1.11.7.2.2.4. Pro: Voter ID laws have been passed in the US by [Republicans](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/jim-demint-voter-id-laws/480876/) intending to suppress turnout of key Democrat constituencies in order to ensure re-election victory. These laws would no longer apply if everyone had to vote.
1.11.7.2.2.4.1. Con: Voting should require some amount of effort to better ensure an informed voter.
1.11.7.2.2.4.2. Con: The issue of voter ID laws is specific to the US, not the voting system. Those regulations would therefore not change with mandatory voting.
1.11.7.2.2.4.2.1. Pro: The US is a country that does not have mandatory [national](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_documents_in_the_United_States) IDs, like many other countries do.
1.11.7.2.2.4.2.2. Pro: The laws that require ID to vote [vary](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx) vastly from state to state, thus making the process confusing and complicated.
1.11.7.2.2.4.2.3. Pro: Unlike in many other countries, some laws passed in the US are very strict and do not offer [alternative](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/voter-id-proponents-point-to-laws-in-other-countries/2012/07/12/gJQAVlGCfW_blog.html?utm_term=.b7c1c2dc87e6) forms of identification.
1.11.7.2.2.4.3. Pro: Many [studies](http://pages.ucsd.edu/~zhajnal/page5/documents/VoterIDLawsSuppressionofMinorityVoters.pdf) have [concluded](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/elections/voter-id-laws-empirical-evidence-government-accountability-office) that strict voter ID laws in the US have a negative impact on voter turnout in Hispanic, Black, Asian and multi-racial populations.
1.11.7.2.2.4.3.1. Con: Countries where the [registration](http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/publications/Expanding.Democracy.pdf) process is assumed by the government instead of individuals can get better turnouts by making voting easier for everyone \(especially those with less money, less time or less education\) without the need to make voting mandatory.
1.11.7.2.2.5. Pro: Because considerably more people would vote, elections would become more contestable, with incumbents facing genuine challengers who could defeat them. This is likely to make them more faithful to their voters, leading to better and more representative policy outcomes.
1.11.7.2.2.5.1. Pro: In low-turnout settings incumbents can selectively target supporters for mobilization, and they may have an easier time defining and catering to the demands of a smaller electorate.
1.11.7.2.2.5.2. Con: How contestable an election is depends on many factors aside from turnout.
1.11.7.2.2.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.9.2.7.
1.11.7.2.2.6. Con: This [study](https://www.rochester.edu/college/faculty/bmeguid/Endogenous_Institutions_Helmke_Meguid_May_2010.pdf) \(Helmke and Meguid, p. 1\) shows that most countries that adopted compulsory voting did so as a strategic consideration. The incumbent party thought that more of their supporters did not vote than those of the opposition, and therefore adopted compulsory voting in order to win elections.
1.11.7.2.2.6.1. Con: Even if parties approve changes in an electoral system that benefit them at the time, if in the long run those changes are beneficial − for example, increasing turnout or decreasing the costs in mobilising the electorate – those changes are not bad per se.
1.11.7.2.2.7. Con: -> See 1.11.7.2.2.5.2.
1.11.7.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.7.2.2.1.
1.11.7.2.4. Con: -> See 1.5.9.3.1.1.15.
1.11.7.3. Con: [Elections](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/29/why-elections-are-bad-for-democracy) do not automatically foster democracy, but also have the potential to prevent or destroy it.
1.11.7.3.1. Pro: Some dictators have been democratically elected. [Ferdinand Marcos](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~vmitchel/fw8.html) won the presidency of the Philippines in a standard democratic election, became very popular, and won re-election before declaring martial law and becoming a dictator. [Adolf Hitler](http://www.dw.com/en/fact-or-fiction-adolf-hitler-won-an-election-in-1932/a-18680673) came to power via a completely legitimate parliamentary election in which the Nazi party received the most votes by a huge margin.
1.11.7.3.1.1. Con: This is a reason to strengthen democratic institutions and prevent individual heads of states from passing totalitarian laws. The likelihood of elected candidates becoming dictators is minuscule, while the benefits are far more certain and likely.
1.11.7.3.1.2. Con: The elections did not actually destroy the democracy in these cases. Instead, it was a dictator who craved more power in those countries that was the cause of the problems.
1.11.7.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.9.3.1.1.13.6.1.2.
1.11.7.3.3. Con: The article suggests [sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition) - the act of selecting political officials randomly from the population - as an alternative to elections, yet that is a worse system than elections.
1.11.7.3.3.1. Pro: In sortition, the room for error in choosing the sample is too big a risk to take, as you could end up with a completely unrepresentative group of people in power. Elections are still preferable.
1.11.7.3.3.2. Pro: [Sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition), as an alternative to elections, results in professional bureaucrats having too much power as career politicians are able to navigate the vast swathes of bureaucracy, whereas randomly selected civilians won't know the ins and outs of the bureaucratic machinery. Elections are still preferable to sortition.
1.11.7.4. Pro: By voting, people express their will. It is a required act for a political system that is considered to be a democracy.
1.11.7.4.1. Con: Citizens not voting is also an expression free will.
1.11.7.5. Con: Even if voting is required to keep a political system alive, the level of voting in countries with voluntary voting - which is almost all countries in the world - is obviously enough to keep those governments from collapsing.
1.11.7.5.1. Con: However, voter turnout is generally [decreasing](http://www.e-ir.info/2012/09/27/why-is-turnout-at-elections-declining-across-the-democratic-world/) throughout the democratic worlds. Turnout could potentially become a problem, without a solution.
1.11.8. Pro: Even if a citizen does not like either \(or any\) of the candidates running for election, it is probable that there will be a candidate who is slightly less bad for them. Helping to get that candidate elected is beneficial for that individual, even if only marginally.
1.11.8.1. Con: If a citizen does not like any of the candidates running for office, they are likely to cast a blank vote or make their vote illegitimate.
1.11.8.1.1. Con: While it is true that with optional voting these people would likely stay home, once they are forced to the ballot box, they are likely to vote in whatever way benefits them the most. It is unlikely that they would cast a blank vote if they could see that one candidate is less bad.
1.11.8.1.2. Con: A few citizens casting blank votes is not a reason to not implement this policy. A majority would still vote properly.
1.11.8.1.3. Pro: In Australia where voting is compulsory, approximately [6% of voters place informal votes](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-04/informal-votes-to-have-impact-on-election-result-in-close-seats/7566232). These votes include deliberate votes where people have instead drawn a picture on the ballot paper or voted for fictional candidates. The figure also includes unintentional informal votes as well \(for example, incorrectly filling out the ballot paper\).
1.11.8.2. Con: -> See 1.11.6.
1.11.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.10.1.1.2.
1.11.9. Pro: -> See 1.5.10.1.1.2.
1.11.10. Pro: Voting is not limited to the election of representatives. Important ballot initiatives or plebiscites that directly affect a citizen's life are also decided.
1.11.11. Con: It is not for the state to determine or enforce adherence to what is in a citizen's best interest.
1.11.11.1. Con: Assuming voting has no cost, it is a provable fact that voting is in one's best interest on average.
1.11.11.1.1. Con: Voting does have costs.
1.The time spent on going to the pooling place and back home.
2.Costs of paper, people counting the votes etc.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_voting)
1.11.11.2. Pro: One person's belief that that they know what is good for the other does not equate to the moral usage of force to compel action.
1.11.11.3. Con: -> See 1.5.9.3.1.1.13.7.
1.12. Pro: Compulsory voting generates better electoral outcomes.
1.12.1. Con: Evidence from Austria [showed](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272716301487) that the introduction of compulsory voting had little to no effect on government spending patterns or electoral outcomes.
1.12.1.1. Con: By contrast, an [analysis of evidence from Australia](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/westminster_model_democracy/files/fowler_compulsoryvoting.pdf) finds a significant increase in the turnout of poorer Australians, resulting in an increase in the Labor Party vote share, and, in turn, a sustained increase in pension spending.
1.12.1.2. Con: It may be the case that the government of Austria was already well-representative of the desires of the population.

This is known not to be the case in other democracies - the US and the UK particularly spring to mind as obvious modern examples of democracies where the distribution of government power and decision making is known to be strongly divergent from the polled wishes of the electorate.
1.12.2. Con: As long as a large sample of the population votes, the results are a statistically significant representation of the entire population.
1.12.3. Con: Those forced to vote may spoil ballot in protest, therefore election outcomes may not change.
1.12.3.1. Con: The spoiling of the ballot paper would be a right of that voter. That is that voter making a conscious decision not to vote and would be counted as such. At the very least, the authorities would then know how many people are inclined to do this should voting be compulsory.
1.12.4. Con: The election results no longer represent the degree and intensity to which individuals care about political issues.
1.12.5. Pro: Compulsory voting reduces the power of special interest groups.
1.12.5.1. Con: Special interest groups are not always a bad thing and most of the time are good like in medicine and science research, if it weren't for special interest groups, working on the smaller things ignored by most, the world wouldn't have [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), [ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/about-isro) and [ESA](https://www.esa.int/ESA) and others which are important.
1.12.6. Con: Compulsory voting encourages politicians to appeal to the largest number of voters, dumbing down the debate and discouraging smarter and more educated voters from participating.
1.12.7. Pro: The [chain of legitimacy](https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/sfb597/123.html) in a democratic state always goes down to the 'people'. If the will of the people is going to be used for [democratic legitimacy](https://muse.jhu.edu/book/30277) it is just normal that the system should aim for a very precise representation of that will, compulsory voting is the best instrument for this.
1.12.8. Pro: Compulsory voting is good for minor parties.
1.12.8.1. Con: In strong two-party systems where the “winner takes it all”, mandatory voting does not necessarily increase or guarantee better outcomes for minor parties.
1.12.8.1.1. Pro: In Belgium \(a system with plurality of parties and mandatory voting\) the People’s Party could get one seat with 1.51% of the votes and in the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_Netherlands) \(also a plurality system yet with voluntary voting\) the pensioners party got two seats with 1.9% of the votes.
1.12.8.1.2. Pro: The way in which votes are counted and distributed has more impact in political landscapes than making voting mandatory. In Uruguay voting has been [mandatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_voting) since 1934 \(enforced in 1970\), and the country has evolved from a strong two-party system into a [multiparty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Uruguay) system thanks to electoral reforms. Mandatory voting had no bearing in these differences.
1.12.8.2. Pro: With optional voting, people who might vote for minor parties would be likely to stay home because they know their vote would make no difference. With mandatory voting, they would go to the polls, increasing the vote for minor parties.
1.12.8.2.1. Pro: Given that in some democracies, parties receive [funding](https://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/facts/DICE/Public-Sector/Public-Governance-and-Law/Financing-of-Political-Parties/Financing-political-parties-public-funding/fileBinary/Financing-political-parties-public-funding.pdf) for each vote that is cast for them, this can allow minor parties to generate more revenue to continue their existence.
1.12.8.2.1.1. Pro: Even in supranational entities like the European Union, political parties with representation also receive EU [funding](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/contracts-and-grants/en/20150201PVL00101/Political-parties-and-foundations).
1.12.8.2.1.2. Con: In Belgium, where voting is mandatory, political parties receive [funding](https://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/facts/DICE/Public-Sector/Public-Governance-and-Law/Financing-of-Political-Parties/Financing-political-parties-public-funding/fileBinary/Financing-political-parties-public-funding.pdf) only if they manage to get representation. Therefore, mandatory voting does not necessarily guarantee better funding for minor parties.
1.12.8.2.1.2.1. Con: [Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_voting) is not mandatory. [Attending the vote](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=nl&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnl.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FOpkomstplicht&edit-text=&act=url) [is mandatory](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=nl&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnl.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FKiesrecht%23Situatie_in_Nederland_en_Belgi%C3%AB&sandbox=1) and is technically something one can be fined over if one doesn't attend, but that rule has rarely if ever been enforced.
1.12.8.3. Pro: Minor parties are good for democracy.
1.12.8.3.1. Pro: If minor parties do receive a sufficient portion of the vote to warrant a seat in government, this means that they can represent other parts of the electorate by increasing the diversity of views within the government.
1.12.8.3.2. Pro: Minor parties help to keep the major parties accountable even if they don't have any direct legislative power.
1.12.8.3.3. Con: In a highly fragmented political system full of minor parties, it is very difficult to reach clear majorities. This impedes the efficacy of government.
1.12.8.3.3.1. Pro: Minor parties can be forced to make difficult coalitions to access government. For example, left-wing Syriza and neo-fascist Golden Dawn in [Greece](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greece-has-a-new-government-as-syriza-forms-coalition-with-right-wing-independent-greeks-10002368.html).
1.12.8.3.3.1.1. Con: This assumes that they need to be in power to be beneficial. Just the presence of minor parties forces governments to be more accountable.
1.12.8.3.3.2. Pro: Belgium's parliament has [ten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Federal_Parliament) different political groups. After the 2010 elections, given the difficulty of generating sufficient alliances, the country broke records by going [8 months](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/belgium-ndash-eight-months-with-no-government-2213128.html) without forming a government.
1.12.8.3.4. Pro: Two-party systems [force multiple groups](http://observer.com/2016/05/the-primaries-arent-rigged-but-the-two-party-system-is/) to become uneasy allies in elections. For example, the fundamentalist Christians and pro-business anti-tax advocates, who make up two of the largest groups of voters in the GOP, have few shared interests or priorities. Multiple parties allow these groups to be adequately represented, since they don't have to force themselves to compromise with other groups in a major party.
1.12.8.3.4.1. Con: These minor parties still have to compromise to form a government.
1.12.8.3.5. Con: There is no especial reason to believe that minor parties are inherently better for democracy. If the views of the public are best represented by the major parties, those parties will continue to dominate the political landscape, and should indeed do so.
1.12.8.4. Con: Many countries have an [electoral threshold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_threshold) to access parliament. Thus the growth of minor parties would be marginal.
1.12.8.4.1. Con: Most commentators [conclude](http://apo.org.au/files/Resource/06rb06.pdf) that, without compulsory voting, the set of parties that operate as the Coalition would have better results \(p. 20\).
1.12.8.4.1.1. Con: This does not mean that the Coalition loses out to minor parties. The Coalition could lose out to other established parties as a result of compulsory voting as well.
1.12.8.4.2. Pro: Compulsory voting also increases voter identification with established parties. Australia has one of the highest levels of party identification in the world. Therefore, even though minor or protest parties also benefit from compulsory voting, the advantage they gain is small compared to the support for [major](https://www.academia.edu/3189508/Compulsory_voting_party_stability_and_electoral_advantage_in_Australia) parties.
1.12.8.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.12.8.3.3.1.1.
1.12.8.4.3. Con: Minor parties in Australia seem to benefit from compulsory voting and are big [supporters](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.488.1436&rep=rep1&type=pdf) of it \(Jackman, p. 8\).
1.12.8.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.12.8.1.2.
1.12.8.5. Pro: If someone is disenchanted with the political system \(or the current government\), they might be encouraged to vote for a minor party. This means that many people might cast votes for these parties instead of spoiling their ballot.
1.12.8.6. Con: This assumes that those not currently voting would vote for minor parties. It is equally plausible that those who stay home do so because they do not feel a need to vote in order to get the outcome they desire - i.e. that they are happy with the representatives being elected.
1.12.8.7. Pro: -> See 1.12.8.2.1.
1.12.8.8. Con: Minor party voters tend to be comparatively informed and engaged, and so are most likely to turn out in a voluntary voting system, particularly in a country with an electoral system that allows minor parties to achieve representation. \([DPS](http://apo.org.au/files/Resource/06rb06.pdf), p. 21\)
1.12.9. Pro: -> See 1.11.7.2.2.
1.12.10. Con: Many people are uninformed or do not care about politics. Their votes will skew the electoral process and give an inaccurate result.
1.12.10.1. Pro: Democracy is overrated. Making more people vote does not necessarily mean better democracy.
1.12.10.2. Pro: All voting should be informed voting, and it is debatable whether people ought to even have the right to vote if they cannot demonstrate competence in the issues/candidates/laws being proposed. The ignorant and apathetic should be compelled by law to not vote.
1.12.10.2.1. Con: It would be impossible to generate a test to implement this restriction without introducing deep, unavoidable political bias -- whether or not intentional, whether or not in line with any major party's agenda.
1.12.10.2.1.1. Pro: Such a test would necessarily distort the outcome of a vote and the nature of a state's politics in ways other than a straightforward narrowing of participation to those participants who take a proactive interest in the precise mechanics of the state.
1.12.10.3. Pro: If someone is uninformed, they are likely to vote for irrational reasons.
1.12.10.3.1. Con: There is no such thing as an irrational reason to vote. If an individual chooses to vote based on how much they like the candidate's name, then that is them exercising their democratic right.
1.12.10.3.2. Pro: An individual could choose to 'donkey vote' by placing the top name first, then the second-top second and so on.
1.12.10.3.2.1. Pro: This phenomenon was seen in Australia in 2013. The Liberal-Democrats received approximately [3% of the nationwide tally yet 9% of the New South Wales vote](http://www.aec.gov.au/results) where they were listed first. This was sufficient for them to be elected.
1.12.10.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.15.
1.12.10.4. Pro: Increasing the noise in an information system, such as for example adding coerced insincere votes into a system meant to collect information about the opinions and preferences of a population, never improves the signal-to-noise ratio, while decreased such noise always does.
1.12.10.4.1. Pro: The participation rate in free elections is a vital metric in assessing the efficacy of a democracy.
1.12.10.5. Pro: Under the current system, only those who care enough and are politically engaged will vote. It is a self-selecting system that automatically gives power to those who care most about the outcome.
1.12.10.6. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.
1.12.10.7. Pro: -> See 1.10.3.3.1.1.
1.12.10.8. Con: Many voters are uninformed and easily manipulated, and many non-voters are informed and are not easily manipulated. It is not clear what proportions of such voters participating in an election constitutes a skewed or inaccurate result.
1.12.11. Pro: The election result is more representative when a greater diversity of people vote.
1.12.11.1. Pro: With compulsory voting, the lower/working class could outvote upper classes and politicians would need to look at all the voters, and their individual needs.
1.12.11.2. Pro: In the [United States](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/universal_voting.pdf), citizens with lower levels of income and education are less likely to vote, as are young adults and recent immigrants. This means that without compulsory voting, certain demographics are represented in government more than others.
1.12.11.2.1. Pro: “Marginal voters” \(those who vote depending on circumstances\) in the US are [more likely to support the Democratic party](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11156810/Fowler_gsas.harvard_0084L_10773.pdf?sequence=1). The turnout of these voters can drastically impact an election's result.
1.12.11.2.2. Pro: The demographics that tend to consistently not vote are not considered when it comes to formulating public policy, as elected officials do not feel that they are beholden to them.
1.12.11.2.2.1. Pro: If a policy will harm a group that consistently does not vote, politicians are unlikely to feel threatened by potential backlash from that group, and so lack a disincentive to pass the policy.
1.12.11.2.3. Con: Provided those citizens have the same access to voting, the fact that they choose to not vote and thus to be less represented is their own prerogative.
1.12.11.2.3.1. Con: This ignores structural factors that make minorities feel as if they have no say in politics and thus choose not to vote.
1.12.11.2.3.1.1. Pro: When minorities have been consistently disregarded \(and sometimes even oppressed\) by government, they are unlikely to feel that their voice is important.
1.12.11.2.3.1.1.1. Con: LGBT movements around the world have been disregarded and oppressed by their governments, and yet they have fought to make their voices heard.
1.12.11.2.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.7.2.2.4.3.
1.12.11.2.4. Con: -> See 1.6.6.2.1.
1.12.11.2.5. Con: -> See 1.11.7.2.2.4.3.1.
1.12.11.3. Pro: This encourages politicians to visit all parts of their constituencies in an attempt to garner support from everybody, not just those who are likely to vote for them.
1.12.11.3.1. Con: -> See 1.8.9.1.2.
1.12.11.3.2. Con: -> See 1.8.9.1.1.
1.12.11.4. Pro: [Optional voting](http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/24/news/economy/rich-vote-more/) gives greater power to those who are more socially powerful, as they are more likely to vote.
1.12.11.4.1. Pro: When voting was made optional in the Netherlands in 1970, the groups most likely to continue voting were disproportionately older, richer and male, while those who were less likely to vote were younger, poorer and female.
1.12.11.4.1.1. Pro: Voting rates dropped an [additional 6%](http://cps.sagepub.com/content/7/3/292.full.pdf) for women than they did for men.
1.12.11.4.1.2. Pro: Voting rates dropped an [additional 19%](http://cps.sagepub.com/content/7/3/292.full.pdf) for those aged 25-29 than for those older than 60.
1.12.11.4.2. Pro: This goes against the notion of democracy being the great equaliser, where every individual in society is afforded the same voice when it comes to voting.
1.12.11.4.2.1. Con: That modern democracies are innately egalitarian is untrue. There are several inequalities built into the voting process.
1.12.11.4.2.1.1. Pro: [Gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) is the practice in which the controlling political party redraws voting districts to favor their candidates. It is blatantly [unfair and undemocractic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/01/this-is-the-best-explanation-of-gerrymandering-you-will-ever-see/), yet it happens in [countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering#National_examples_of_gerrymandering) all over the world.
1.12.11.4.2.1.2. Pro: People can have their right to vote denied for several reasons. One in forty American adults, for example, could [not vote](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/06/us/unequal-effect-of-laws-that-block-felons-from-voting.html) in the previous Presidential election because they had a previous felony conviction.
1.12.11.4.2.1.3. Pro: In most representative systems one person’s vote does not have the same weight as another. Because of representation processes, a vote in more populated areas is worth less in terms of actual elected candidates than a vote in a less populated area.
1.12.11.4.2.1.3.1. Pro: The US Senate has two senators for every state, no matter the size. \(Thus, for example, the 585,000 people of Wyoming have as much power in the Senate as the 39,000,000 people of California.\) Many argue that this is [systemically unfair](http://gawker.com/5989903/reminder-the-us-senate-should-be-abolished).
1.12.11.4.2.1.4. Con: Even though there are instances where democracies are not completely egalitarian, this does not provide justification for further widening of the inequality. Any act which undermines democracy should be curtailed where possible.
1.12.11.4.2.1.5. Con: There is no justification for any of these other inequalities being perpetuated. They should also be removed.
1.12.11.4.2.1.5.1. Con: As democracy in most countries is representative and not direct, some of those inequalities are just built into the system to make it work. A system where each vote is worth exactly the same in a highly-populated country is almost impossible.
1.12.11.4.2.1.6. Pro: The Electoral College in the US is an undemocratic institution. It is possible for a presidential candidate to lose the popular vote yet still become President by winning the Electoral College. \(This has happened [four times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_\(United_States\)#Criticism), including in 2016.\)
1.12.11.4.2.1.6.1. Con: The Electoral College can be seen as an extreme form of representative democracy: the popular vote designates representatives, who in turn choose final political representatives. It can equate to census suffrage instead of universal suffrage, yet is still democratic in a wide sense.
1.12.11.4.2.1.6.1.1. Con: Representative democracy allocates representatives as evenly as possible across the country, which the Electoral College does not.
1.12.11.4.2.1.6.2. Con: Democracy does not require that an unalloyed popular vote determines the head of government. Many countries use electorate-level elections to elect representatives, who in turn elect the head of government.
1.12.11.4.2.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.11.7.2.2.4.3.
1.12.11.4.3. Pro: From 1997 to 2005 in general elections in the UK, the difference in participation between manual and non-manual workers increased from 5% to 11%. Likewise, the difference in participation between bottom earners and top earners has changed from 7% in 1960 to 13% in 2005 [\(Lever, p. 5\)](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/23098/1/Compulsory_voting\(LSERO\).pdf).
1.12.11.4.4. Con: Everybody still has a chance to participate with optional voting. This is not a reason to force everybody to vote.
1.12.11.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.5.3.2.
1.12.11.4.6. Con: -> See 1.6.10.4.
1.12.11.5. Pro: An estimated 57.9% of eligible [voters](http://heavy.com/news/2016/11/eligible-voter-turnout-for-2016-data-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-republican-democrat-popular-vote-registered-results/) voted in the last US Presidential election. As a result, the winning candidate isn't representative of the majority of the voting public, or the country, but only of a few strategically placed voters. Mandatory voting will bring about more representative outcomes.
1.12.11.5.1. Pro: Mandatory voting generates more representative electoral outcomes particularly in [first-past-the-post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) systems like the U.S.
1.12.11.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.12.8.1.
1.12.11.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.5.3.
1.12.11.7. Pro: Electoral reforms that can expand the voting electorate can have decisive electoral [consequences](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11156810/Fowler_gsas.harvard_0084L_10773.pdf?sequence=1).
1.12.12. Pro: The election result is more representative when a greater percentage of the citizenry vote.
1.12.12.1. Con: The votes of people who do not wish to vote, do not understand or have no interest in politics and are just ticking a box to avoid a fine would make the result less representative, not more.
1.12.12.1.1. Pro: Politics is complex subject combining almost all matters of science, industry, and other as all disciplines require a sort legislative. This is very difficult to understand to a certain point, when one can decide properly.
1.12.12.1.2. Con: Some countries with mandatory voting run tallies of the canceled votes, or even add a "none of the above" option. This enables the compiling of additional electoral data relevant to understanding what segments of the population do not feel represented in the choices they are offered.
1.12.12.2. Con: The majority that don't vote are people who are uninformed on the issues. Forcing people to vote, aside from being difficult to implement without a police state, does not make for better electoral outcomes, only higher number of votes.
1.12.12.3. Pro: The choice to not vote is an implicit vote for the winner, rather than a protest which results in a vote being taken away. This is due to the mechanics of normal voting systems being summative \(1+1+...\). As such, those who choose to vote do so at the risk of the voting majority going counter to their own interest, which leads to the potential for a non-representative minority to protect the interests of the majority.
1.12.12.4. Con: The election result is more representative, but at the high cost of forcing a vote to get higher representation. In a diverse society people should be allowed not to vote so minority claims may have higher value or the majority will just ruin the constitution for the majority's own benefits.
1.12.12.5. Pro: Mandatory voting has proven to guarantee higher [turnout](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2014/140739/LDM_BRI\(2014\)140739_REV1_EN.pdf) in EU Parliament elections. Where voting is compulsory, turnout can reach 90% \(e.g. Belgium and Luxembourg\), whereas in countries where it is voluntary, it ranges from 60% \(Germany, Ireland, Italy and Montenegro\) to lower than 40% \(UK, Slovenia and Portugal\).
1.12.12.5.1. Con: Some countries can achieve a relatively high turnout without compulsory voting \(like Germany\), while in others it is really low \(like the UK\). Therefore, turnout will depend on how engaged the population is with the institutions they have to elect. If the system appeals to the people, making sure they are heard and applying transparent and representative policies, turnout can increase without the need to make voting mandatory.
1.12.12.5.1.1. Con: While it is true that voter turnout is likely to vary with optional voting, compulsory voting guarantees it to be high.
1.12.12.5.2. Pro: In Belgium, if voting was not mandatory \(depending on the region\) around 20-28% of respondents [would never vote](http://bdq.reseau-quetelet.cnrs.fr/en/Questionnaire/255) and only 38-48% would always vote.
1.12.12.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.7.3.
1.12.12.7. Pro: Citizens are less likely to complain about the result of an election if everyone had to participate in it.
1.12.12.7.1. Con: The same dissatisfaction that is seen in democracies with optional voting is also [present](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-38375687) in nations where compulsory voting has been in place for a long time. Just because citizens are forced to vote doesn't mean they are satisfied with the vote they cast.
1.12.12.8. Con: When all the population is forced to vote, the number of spoiled ballots \(or votes made without any reasoning other than the mere obligation\) is likely to increase. Therefore, a high turnout of people who did not want to express their opinions in the first place does not really increase legitimacy.
1.12.12.8.1. Con: It is unlikely that every single person who would otherwise have not voted would cast an informal or blank ballot. Therefore, the number of formal ballots would still substantially increase with compulsory voting.
1.12.12.8.1.1. Pro: While some people choose not to vote to make a statement, it is also likely that many others do not vote because they simply cannot be bothered. At the point at which they are forced to go to booths, these people are likely to cast a legitimate vote.
1.12.12.8.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.12.8.5.
1.12.12.8.2. Con: If political apathy is so strong that the percentage of informal ballots rises drastically, then it is important to know in that situation that there is actually a legitimacy problem. Under optional voting, no one knows why those other people are not voting so this would remain unknown.
1.12.12.8.3. Pro: A country with an established tradition of compulsory voting, Australia, has one of the [highest](https://www.academia.edu/3189508/Compulsory_voting_party_stability_and_electoral_advantage_in_Australia) rates of spoiled ballots among liberal democracies.
1.12.12.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.8.
1.12.12.9. Con: Popular opinion isn't always necessarily the same as enlightened opinion, yet in any case mandatory voting only guarantees more opinions than non-mandatory; the quality of those opinions is not necessarily better or worse.
1.12.12.9.1. Con: This assumes there is an 'enlightened' or 'correct' opinion. More importantly, the purpose of voting is to participate in democracy. 'Enlightened' voting, even if it were to exist, is not a purpose of voting.
1.12.13. Con: Assuming that the purpose of voting is to arrive at an accurate consensus, an outcome significantly comprised of votes cast under duress is never better than one for which votes were cast freely.
1.13. Con: It will be very difficult to implement this in many places.
1.13.1. Con: It would be possible to use mobile phones with which to vote. These could include distributed adaptive systems to ensure one vote per person and to ensure we know who votes but not how they voted.
1.13.1.1. Con: Mobile phones are an extremely poor solution to problems of voter identification, identity theft, and fraudulent voting. No "distributed adaptive" voting system yet exists which meaningfully solves these problems.
1.13.2. Con: This is no different than, for instance, collecting taxes or distributing social services. With modern communication technology and infrastructure, it is not terribly difficult to keep track of people.
1.13.2.1. Con: This brings up the moral quandary of tracking people in the first place. Not everyone is on-grid, and they shouldn't have to be if that is their free choice.
1.13.2.1.1. Con: If someone has "freely chosen" to be so far off-grid that they can't even vote, then they are already not meaningfully participating in civic society.  Making votes compulsory will not make them any less politically engaged than they already are.
1.13.2.2. Con: This brings up the question of why we do not simply vote electronically from home.
1.13.2.2.1. Con: There are very serious fraud, voter intimidation and identification issues associated with voting electronically from home, and no good solution has yet been proposed.
1.13.2.3. Pro: A system could be implemented that would automatically withhold the fine, as if it were a tax, and refund it upon filing proof of polling station attendance. This would both incentivize adherence and create an economic stimulus, as all citizens would receive a simultaneous influx of liquid capital similar to a tax rebate.
1.13.2.4. Pro: The fine could be enforced through existing mechanisms - an invoice sent to the person's registered address, and if it goes unpaid, attached as an additional debt to the government when they next file a tax return, deducted from government benefits, or collected from an employer out of wages.
1.13.3. Con: Difficulty in enforcing a law does not mean it should not be implemented. Many thefts go unresolved, but that does not mean that we legalise theft.
1.13.3.1. Pro: If we consider voting to be such an inherent public good, then we can put the effort in to make this happen. [India set up](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/Indias-democracy-reaches-out-to-lone-voter-in-Gujarats-Gir-forest/articleshow/34009509.cms) an entire polling place for one person.
1.13.4. Pro: -> See 1.11.6.3.4.
1.13.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.3.1.
1.13.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.1.
1.13.7. Con: Compulsory voting is successfully [enforced](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2123.html) in 21 nations which is an indication that this could work.
1.13.7.1. Con: If only around the 40% of countries with compulsory voting can actually enforce it, it is also an indication of how difficult it is.
1.13.7.1.1. Con: It is not clear whether those countries that do not enforce it are unable to or just don't have the desire to. Consequently, it is more useful to look at those countries that have successfully enforced it as an indication of its feasibility.
1.13.7.2. Pro: These countries are also a diverse set, spread across the world and with different political systems. This suggests that compulsory voting works in a variety of political situations.
1.14. Con: -> See 1.5.9.3.1.1.
