Discussion Title: Was Boromir Evil?

1. Boromir was evil.
1.1. Con: He was pragmatic.
1.1.1. Pro: He knew you can't just walk into Mordor.
1.1.2. Pro: He hated cave trolls.
1.2. Con: He was supposed to be demonstrating the weakness of men, not the evil in them.
1.2.1. Pro: He was the most "human" character in The Lord of the Rings. Considering the power of The Ring, how the society, the era and the location were constructed, his response was not exactly evil - not perfect, but natural or normal.
1.2.2. Con: Boromir may have been an example of the weakness innate in mankind, but he was also an example of the evil that our weakness can bring about.
1.2.3. Pro: The power of the Ring is greater the more powerful a person is and Boromir was one of the most powerful men of his time.
1.3. Con: He was misguided.
1.3.1. Pro: He was a man working to do what he believed was best for his people. Boromir did not have notions of subjecting the innocent, or waging endless wars or whatever other nonsense that is typically associated with evil. Rather he wanted to take the weapon of the enemy \(an object that was inherently evil\) to do good things. He would have undoubtedly done evil, but it would have been with good intentions.
1.4. Pro: He had a strong and oftentimes unpleasant personality.
1.4.1. Pro: He was easily corrupted, which is a trait typically associated with evil people.
1.4.2. Pro: He drank too much.
1.4.2.1. Con: Being a drunk does not make someone evil.
1.5. Pro: He was a traitor to the Fellowship and his people.
1.5.1. Con: Desperation to save his country drove Boromir to betray the Fellowship of the Ring.
1.5.2. Con: Boromir's last stand made up for his betrayal.
1.5.2.1. Pro: He died trying to save "the little ones" from capture.
1.5.2.2. Pro: He compensated his treason by honorably fighting and dying against the Uruk-hai.
1.5.3. Con: He was just under the influence of the Ring.
1.5.3.1. Con: Since the Ring is a fictional object, nobody can say how difficult it is to resist its temptation or if it is even possible.
1.6. Con: He was a formidable warrior.
1.6.1. Pro: He fought bravely, according to Aragon.
1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.6.3. Pro: Boromir was a respected warrior among his people, fighting Sauron's armies for years and earning the title of High Warden of the White Tower.
1.6.4. Pro: It took three arrows piercing his body to take him down.
1.7. Pro: He was the inferior sibling.
1.7.1. Con: His father Denethor was literally mad and still loved Boromir.
1.8. Pro: He was of weaker mental strength than a Hobbit.
1.8.1. Con: The One Ring is specifically designed to corrupt and bend the minds of Men, Dwarves, and Elves. No man can stem off its corruption forever, and that was the same of the Hobbits \(albeit much slower\).
1.8.2. Con: He only asked for the strength to defend his people.
1.8.2.1. Con: He believed that Gondor would be able to protect the rest of the Middle Earth.
1.9. Pro: He loved Gondor more than the rest of Middle Earth.
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.
1.9.2. Con: It's not inherently evil to love your country.
