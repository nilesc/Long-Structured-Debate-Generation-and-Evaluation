Discussion Title: Did the Mediterranean Sea desiccate 5.5 million years ago?

1. The Mediterranean desiccated partially 5.5 million years ago, its level decreasing by more than 500 meters due to evaporation
1.1. Con: Lago-Mare deposits of the latest MSC sequence suggest pan-Mediterranean brackish-water environments in areas topographically higher than the salt deposits. This points to a Mediterranean fully filled with low-salinity water before the restoration of open marine conditions.
1.2. Con: The massive presence of salt does not require the desiccation or level drawdown of the sea. \(f.e., [Meijer 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X06004286), EPSL; [Garcia-Castellanos & Villaseñor, 2011](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10651)\)
1.2.1. Pro: Competing tectonics and erosion at the Gibraltar Arc could have regulated salinity.
1.3. Pro: There are widespread erosion features buried under post-Messinian sediment and currently up to 2000 m below present sea level. [Lofi et al., 2010, MSC Atlas](https://ccgm.org/en/home/148-seismic-atlas-of-the-messinian-salinity-crisis-markers-2853630978.html).
1.3.1. Pro: Canyons have been excavated at the main river mouths during the MSC, interpreted as the result of a sea level lowering. [Urgeles et al., 2011, Basin Res.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2117.2010.00477.x/abstract)
1.3.1.1. Pro: Evidence from the [Nile valley](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/bsgf/article-lookup/181/1/19) and the [Rhone valley](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618204000308) supports erosion by rivers flowing down to the abyssal plain.
1.3.1.2. Con: Such canyons may be explained alternatively by submarine erosion related to high-density flows formed by the surface evaporation. [Roveri et al., 2014, AJS](http://www.ajsonline.org/content/314/3/751.short)
1.4. Con: Desiccation would have caused so many effects on the geological record that it would be uncontestable today
1.5. Pro: Geophysical data suggest an abrupt ending of the Messinian salinity crisis related to an abrupt reflooding event. This would imply a significantly lower level of the Mediterranean Sea relative to the Atlantic Ocean.[MIcallef et al., 2018, Sci. Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19446-3)
1.5.1. Pro: Erosional features in the Gulf of Cadiz, Alboran Sea, and Malta escarpment are consistent with a very high energy flow putting an end to the MSC.
1.5.2. Pro: Megaflood deposits have been described in the Ionian Sea
1.5.3. Con: The end of the MSC may have been abruptly ended by pumping related to the density contrast between both sides of the Gibraltar Arc region.
