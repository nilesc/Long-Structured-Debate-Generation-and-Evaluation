Discussion Title: Mark Twain used the N-word in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Should it be censored?

1. Racially insensitive words in [The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn) should be changed when it's being taught in school.
1.1. Pro: Without censoring offensive words, students will be more likely to adopt racially insensitive words and/or attitudes.
1.1.1. Pro: The contemporary use of the 'N' word is offensive and as such should be subject to editorial licence so as to reduce its use in the modern lexicon. Language can happily evolve without it.
1.1.2. Con: Preserve the original. Let's take power away from that word instead. Taking it from that book will not prevent people from learning it or using it or not by their choice. Knowing it and not using it is powerful. Using it is a sign of weakness when it is used in an attempt to hurt someone.
1.1.3. Con: Millions of Americans have read this work and very few have adopted its language.
1.1.4. Con: Students should be taught that this was from another time, and that racism was prevalent. They should be conscious that the use of that word in old literature  does not mean it is okay to say it. There was another context in which it was written, which proves that racism existed, exists and should not be performed. It is a literature piece which often depicts society, it is not the book's fault if people choose to behave a certain way knowing that it's wrong.
1.1.5. Pro: Students would be unconsciously primed to imitate the prejudicial attitudes of white Southerners depicted in the book.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Priming people with concepts associated with a particular social category \(for example, "skinheads" or "the elderly"\) causes them to change their attitudes and behavior to be more similar to stereotype-consistent characteristics of that social category. These effects can occur even if the person is not a member of that category, and without awareness or intention \([Kawakami, p. 315](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9280.14451)\).
1.1.5.1.1. Con: The study shows the short-term effects of priming but does not tell us whether these effects persist in the long-term. In the context of school education and the teaching of attitudes, the effect of priming might thus be negligible.
1.1.5.2. Pro: Exposure to the racially derogatory language in the book could dehumanize Black people, making it more likely that the student would unintentionally adopt racist attitudes.
1.1.5.3. Con: Simply learning about or being exposed to something does not mean that it will be copied by students.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: In [sex education](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-sexual-assault-law_us_579a2104e4b0d3568f8647eb) in California, students are taught to identify words of harassment and how to avoid or confront their usage. There is no reason a similar approach could not be taken with racial slurs.
1.1.5.3.2. Pro: In various classes such as history, psychology, and literature, students observe examples of atrocious behavior, such as incidents of murder, however, they \(generally\) do not go on to become murderers as adults.
1.1.5.3.2.1. Con: Bias and racist attitudes are far more easily adopted or internalized. It's a false comparison to equate the adoption of racist attitudes with the violent act of murder.
1.1.5.3.3. Con: Exposure to an ideology or set of actions, even when the actions are discouraged by society, can lead some people to adopt the associated ideology. There is a risk of this occurring in the classroom, too.
1.1.5.3.3.1. Con: People dont become Nazis by discussing Natioal-Socialism in School... They more likely learn something about it.
1.1.5.3.3.2. Pro: [Stochastic terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_terrorism) occurs when a person uses mass communications to spread an extremist ideology, and their message provokes violence in a statistically unpredictable and unexpected way. The messages of terrorists are typically condemned, but can still contribute to the radicalization of an average person.
1.1.5.3.3.3. Pro: Sufficient exposure to racist beliefs and their promotion makes people more inclined to justify racism, viewing it as normal or common, even if no one immediately adopts racist language or behavior.
1.1.5.3.3.3.1. Pro: People [take on the views](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/danielle-slaughter/5-ways-parents-pass-down-_b_10249684.html) of those around them. This is why people are [more likely](https://itstopswithme.humanrights.gov.au/resources/what-you-say-matters/why-are-people-racist) to become racist if they are exposed to the racism of friends and family.
1.1.5.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.1.5.3.5. Con: The Netflix show "13 Reasons Why" was accompanied by an [increase](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/13-reasons-why-link-increase-suicide-threats-toronto-1.4164774) in suicide attempts, as students were [exposed](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/13-reasons-why-and-suicide-contagion1/) to graphic depictions of suicide and suicide was normalized. This occurred even though society generally discourages people from committing suicide.
1.1.5.3.5.1. Con: The encouragement that a person may receive to commit suicide from watching "13 Reasons Why" is different than a student reading a work of classic literature using racist language.
1.1.5.3.5.1.1. Pro: A person may want to commit suicide because of the social and emotional factors portrayed in the show which is set in a modern context. A student would not experience the same social and emotional factors from a book set in mid-1800s.
1.1.5.3.6. Pro: Most students already have an understanding of what words might be offensive, and thus would not be inclined to use them.
1.1.5.3.6.1. Pro: Students [adopt racist views](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2012/06/09/harvard-researcher-says-children-learn-racism-quickly/gWuN1ZG3M40WihER2kAfdK/story.html) long before they reach school age, meaning that whether or not they hear them in school is irrelevant.
1.1.5.3.6.1.1. Con: Even if students hold those views, introducing anti-racist views might still help to create a better school [environment](https://medium.com/being-black-at-school/the-danger-of-not-teaching-anti-racism-in-schools-cea01c1d3d62) where racism is not tolerated.
1.1.5.3.6.1.1.1. Pro: [Twain was undoubtedly anti-racist](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jan/05/censoring-mark-twain-n-word-unacceptable).
1.1.5.3.6.1.2. Con: The same study indicated that racist beliefs were not set in stone and remained malleable, indicating that teacher's choices in the classroom could indeed reinforce a student's prejudices.
1.1.5.3.7. Pro: Many children already hear the N-word on a daily basis, in the context of rap music.
1.1.5.3.7.1. Con: The N-word is not used as a term of racial abuse in rap music. Rather, the term is typically used as a way of addressing someone between in-group members, and therefore does not legitimise its use as a term of racial abuse.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1. Con: Figures within the Black American community [disagree](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/malcolmaime-musoni/stop-saying-nigga-if-your_b_8190836.html) with the word's use in rap music, many believing it still to be abusive no matter the context.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2. Pro: Kendrick Lamar [explains](https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-i-lyrics) his use of the N-word in the song 'i', employing the term in a respectful manner to draw attention to police brutality against Black men.
1.1.5.3.7.1.3. Pro: Paul McCartney has [defended](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/24/kanye-wests-n-word-justified-paul-mccartney) Kanye West for using the N-word "in a completely different way," illustrating the culture of the new urban generation that West describes in his lyrics.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4. Pro: Many white rappers have avoided using the N-word entirely and expressed condemnation towards those who would invoke the oppressive racial implications of the term.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.1. Pro: Yelawolf, a white rapper, [condemned](http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.17086/title.yelawolf-speaks-on-white-rappers-using-the-n-word) the use of the N-word by non-Black artists, stating, "Certain people have the birthright to use that word. As a white rapper, it’s always been a big no-no."
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2. Pro: Mac Miller never uses the N-word in his music, [stating](http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.18791/title.mac-miller-gives-his-take-on-eminem-yelawolf-use-of-the-n-word) that he does not see "any circumstance" where it could be appropriate for him, given the racial history associated with white people using the term.
1.1.5.3.7.1.5. Con: Some white rappers have [used](http://www.houstonpress.com/music/white-rappers-and-the-n-word-conundrum-4-case-studies-6760156) the term to portray Black people as thugs and other negative stereotypes.
1.1.5.3.7.2. Con: There is a huge contextual difference between the use of the N-word in rap music and the depiction of its casual deployment as a term of abuse by nineteenth century whites.
1.1.5.3.7.2.1. Con: This suggests that context is important when understanding offensive language, thus justifying children's exposure to the book in an academic setting.
1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1. Pro: A study determined that harm from racially offensive speech is contextually determined [\(Jay, p. 81\)](https://www.mcla.edu/Assets/uploads/MCLA/import/www.mcla.edu/Undergraduate/uploads/textWidget/1457.00018/documents/DoWordsHarm.pdf). With this in mind, a teacher could create an educational context within a classroom to talk about racist slurs in a way that is unlikely to cause harm.
1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: Teachers are [trained](http://www.nssa.us/journals/2007-29-1/2007-29-1-09.htm) to accommodate the diverse backgrounds of their students and to facilitate a respectful environment towards different backgrounds and cultures.
1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Teachers are [increasingly](http://www.jstor.org.tkc.idm.oclc.org/stable/40171607) aware of how the particular life circumstances of a student influence the way a student reads a piece of literature.
1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: If the teacher is uncomfortable saying the word themselves then they do not have to use it. The students will still be able to read the word, but the teacher does not have to say it.
1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.1.3. Con: Even if teachers are trained they can still suffer from [subconscious bias](http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/research/understanding-implicit-bias/).
1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con: All people have subconscious biases, no doubt. Yet, the proposed bias would be inherent to the teacher, not the text. \(Ironically, the struggle between a friendly nature and hateful learned bias is [the major stated theme of Huckleberry Finn](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2932732?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).\)
1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.1.4. Con: Teachers cannot control how students respond to the subject matter, and students may respond in a disrespectful or offensive manner.
1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.1.4.1. Con: The theoretical instance in which students respond to the book in a disrespectful or offensive manner constitutes an opportunity to teach either by correction or by modeling a more respectful approach.
1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.2. Con: Exposure to incivility, even when one is not the direct object of criticism, can [reduce](https://hbr.org/2013/01/the-price-of-incivility) creativity and cognition.
1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.3. Con: The N-word does not have to be in a distressing context to [trigger](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/06/guide-to-triggering/) memories of hurtful uses of the N-word.
1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Memories of hurtful events can inspire people, either those who are affected by them or others, to challenge the thinking and actions that caused those hurtful events. This is the purpose of the racism depicted in Huckleberry Finn, and is a far more likely reaction and outcome than a traumatic reaction.
1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: Depictions of racism have been shown to cause a [Post Traumatic Stess Disorder-like response](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/black-pain-gone-viral-racism-graphic-videos-can-create-ptsd-like-trauma/) for some people who were previously victims themselves.
1.1.5.3.7.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.
1.1.5.4. Con: Any research on priming should be taken with a pinch of salt. In the words of Novel Prize-winner [Daniel Kahneman](https://www.nature.com/polopoly_fs/7.6716.1349271308!/suppinfoFile/Kahneman%20Letter.pdf), the field has become the "poster child for doubts about the integrity of psychological research" as many results are difficult or impossible to replicate.
1.1.5.4.1. Pro: An [analysis](https://replicationindex.wordpress.com/2017/02/02/reconstruction-of-a-train-wreck-how-priming-research-went-of-the-rails/) of 31 scientific studies cited - ironically - in a book chapter by Kahneman on Priming concluded that these studies are unlikely to be replicatable and should not be seen as scientific evidence. Kahneman admitted [in a response](https://replicationindex.wordpress.com/2017/02/02/reconstruction-of-a-train-wreck-how-priming-research-went-of-the-rails/#comment-1454) that he overestimated the relevance of priming effects and urged caution in drawing conclusions from small studies.
1.1.5.4.2. Pro: Especially the research by John Bargh, who is commonly credited as the academic father of priming studies, [has come under heavy fire](http://www.chronicle.com/article/Power-of-Suggestion/136907/) after it was not possible to reproduce the results of numerous studies he published.
1.1.5.4.2.1. Pro: A study by Bargh and two other researchers which implied that people walk slower after being primed with stereotypes of old age [could not be reproduced](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029081). Instead, the replicators found that the result can be reproduced if researchers are primed into believing that the effect would indeed occur.
1.1.5.4.2.2. Pro: A study by Bargh and other researchers that concluded that exposure to words like "strive" and "attain" improves the performance in straining tasks could [not be replicated](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0072467).
1.1.6. Pro: Through increased exposure to racial epitaphs, students would become accustomed to the use of the N-word and therefore be more likely to use it.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Not using the N-word is often an unspoken norm that happens because of the taboo that surrounds it. When the N-word is uttered the taboo is broken.
1.1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.
1.1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.6.
1.1.6.4. Pro: The N-word is used [over 200 times](http://jcp.proscenia.net/publications/articles_mlr/walsh/Huck_Finn_Power_Words.html) throughout Huckleberry Finn.
1.1.6.4.1. Con: That a word is repeated many times in a book doesn't mean that it will be used in wounding ways as a result of reading it.
1.1.7. Pro: The inclusion of a book that frequently uses \(and would require students and teachers to hear, read and use\) the N-word in the required curriculum of many public schools would effectively legitimize its use in the minds of some students.
1.1.7.1. Pro: When the N-word is used, it evokes America's past and continued violence towards Black Americans: "The word is inextricably linked with violence and brutality on black psyches and derogatory aspersions cast on black bodies. No degree of appropriating can rid it of that bloodsoaked history." \([Lester](http://www.tolerance.org/magazine/number-40-fall-2011/feature/straight-talk-about-n-word)\).
1.1.7.1.1. Con: The entirety of Huck Finn evokes America's past and continued violence towards black Americans. As does all of American history. This should not however stifle art intended to improve the conditions of black Americans.
1.1.7.2. Con: Huckleberry Finn is not a piece of literature which attempts to justify or legitimize racism, as opposed to Mein Kampf for example. Instead, it faithfully depicts the racism of the period it was set in.
1.1.7.2.1. Pro: Twain accurately [reported](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/557602/pdf) how black people were denigrated at the time of writing.
1.1.7.2.2. Pro: That slavery is the norm for the characters does not mean that it is regarded as morally acceptable by the author. [Indeed](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/teachers/huck/essay.html), by the time he wrote the novel Twain "had come to believe that slavery was wrong, and that white Americans owed Black Americans some form of reparations for it."
1.1.7.2.3. Pro: According to Professor David L. Smith, "Even when Twain was writing his book, \[the N-word\] was universally recognized as an insulting, demeaning word" \([Smith, p.107](http://www.mercerislandschools.org/cms/lib3/WA01001855/Centricity/Domain/640/Allen%20Carey-Webb%20Huck%20Finn.pdf)\).
1.1.7.2.4. Con: While the intention of the work as a whole might not be to justify racism or slavery, many of the characters who use the word are doing just that.
1.1.7.2.4.1. Con: And at the time portrayed in the book, the characters represented probably *would* do just that. So to remove their dialog to suit "modern sensibilities" is exactly rewriting history.
1.1.7.2.4.2. Con: The main character does not share these others' sentiments, however; Huckleberry Finn sees these characters in a decidedly negative light, and he is the viewpoint that the reader shares.
1.1.7.2.4.3. Con: The very fact that Jim is called that in the book ties into change Huck goes throughout the story. Let's not forget, the book is about a boy helping a fleeing slave.The fact Jim is even called that in the first place shows just how bad it is for slaves, and why its so important for Huck to help in the first place.
1.1.7.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.6.1.1.1.
1.1.7.3. Con: Presumably, teachers would explain \(repeatedly\) that the slurs in the book are highly hurtful and inflammatory.
1.1.7.3.1. Pro: Any competent instructor should easily be able to teach that racism is important to understand and not perpetuate it.
1.1.7.3.2. Pro: A classroom is not the only place students may encounter racial epithets; it's just ideally the most unbiased place they may encounter them.  If the harm of the word in its historic definition is not taught, the N word is still encountered in popular music by its redefinition and it is context sensitive but not clearly defined who can use it and when. Teachers can provide the debate that is not always found in popular culture.
1.1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.6.
1.1.7.5. Pro: Students perceive the teacher as an authority figure, so when the teacher repeats \(or references\) the uncensored N-word, it may appear as if the teacher believes it is legitimate to use the N-word in certain contexts.
1.1.7.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.1.7.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.7.3.
1.1.7.6. Pro: When teachers present racially offensive material, they accept the [opportunity cost](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/opportunity-cost.html) of offering a platform to these ideas instead of others. This can convey the message to students that these ideas are important or legitimate.
1.1.7.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.
1.1.7.6.2. Pro: If the interest is simply in including a nineteenth century work that outlines the response to slavery other novels serve better. [For example,](https://straightlinelogic.com/reviews/fiction/the-most-overrated-novel-everybody-has-read/) "Twain’s tale lacks the polemic power of Uncle Tom’s Cabin."
1.1.7.6.2.1. Pro: Whatever its other virtues, Huckleberry Finn tells the story of the antebellum South in a way that centers whiteness. Other stories, such as Frederick Douglass's [Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass: An American Slave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Frederick_Douglass,_an_American_Slave) do not.
1.1.7.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.7.2.2.
1.1.7.7. Pro: Students are typically asked to evaluate the merits of certain ideas in class and consider both sides of an issue. As a result, students perceive ideas discussed in the classroom as intellectual and worthy of consideration, but this is not appropriate for a discussion of the N-word.
1.1.7.7.1. Con: While literature classes encourage students to consider different points of view, students are not asked to accept the viewpoints and language of characters as legitimate.
1.1.7.7.2. Con: Students are also taught Ancient Mythology without being expected to consider the views held within intellectual or morally valid.
1.1.8. Con: Students will learn about the harmful racial nature of the N-word when it is taught in class. Because the racial abuse is identified and condemned, students will be less likely to use the term.
1.1.8.1. Pro: The nature of the book lends itself to a condemnation of racism.
1.1.8.1.1. Pro: The use of racially derogatory language in Huckleberry Finn has largely been regarded as [satirical](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/07/us/a-scholar-finds-huck-finn-s-voice-in-twain-s-writing-about-a-black-youth.html?pagewanted=all). Bowdlerizing \(that is, creating a "sanitized" version\) misses the nuance of this language.
1.1.8.1.1.1. Pro: Even if utterly crucial issues of free thought, artistic integrity, and the fostering of maturity were disregarded, the volume is overtly subversive of the bigotry in question, and frequent anecdotal testimony can be found of it's effect as such, as well as the [specific usefulness of it's unbridled nature](https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/teaching-huck-finn-without-regret) for teaching adolescents.
1.1.8.1.1.2. Pro: Mark Twain wrote the book in this way to prove the point that the word in question was used in unsavory ways at the time that the book was written. It is intended to be uncomfortable to read. If the word must be removed, we may as well remove the book itself from curriculum, which would be a black eye on the American education system.
1.1.8.1.1.3. Pro: Twain was using Huck Finn as an avatar for the southerners, and even northerners, who were not sure they felt one way or another about slavery. It's a Troll tactic to use the language, persona, and identities of the opposing side, but show that character have an INTERNAL transformation of conscience, doing so in such a subtle way that even the most hardened reader would come away agreeing with Huck that Jim didn't deserve the term Huck had thoughtlessly used. It's a genius strategy.
1.1.8.1.1.4. Pro: If one looks at the word while thinking about the use of  repetitive consonant sounds, the harsh, pungent sound of the "gg." The sound when read aloud often adds a depth to the cringe upon hearing it, which further draws the reader into Huck's stream of consciousness that observe and sometimes perceive Jim's feelings.
1.1.8.1.1.5. Con: The subtlety of this satire may be missed for many students.
1.1.8.1.1.5.1. Con: As with many other subtle parts of the text, the subtlety of the satire against the racist vocabulary can be highlighted by the teacher.
1.1.8.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Teachers might not have an understanding of the context and history surrounding the racism in the book. They may not feel as if they have ability to do the topic justice.
1.1.8.1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: The shortcomings of a teacher should not dictate class curriculum or content. Teachers should be hired based on their ability to do the job.
1.1.8.1.1.5.1.1.2. Con: Teachers who feel they cannot do a subject justice should simply not teach that topic, rather than materially alter that subject to make themselves more comfortable at the expense of their students.
1.1.8.1.1.5.1.1.3. Con: Even if the teacher is not the perfect person for the topic, they are still better off teaching the topic in an educational manner, rather than the student instead encountering it through other means.
1.1.8.1.1.5.1.1.4. Con: Even if it is an imperfect presentation by the teacher it at least shows that racism happened in the past.
1.1.8.1.1.5.1.1.5. Con: Annotated versions of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn are available for teachers to use, which would provide commentary and notes to help readers understand the context for the uncensored language.
1.1.8.1.1.5.1.1.6. Con: If a teacher feels they do not have the requisite knowledge to do the topic justice, it is their job to research the topic prior to teaching it to their students. This applies to any topic, controversial or otherwise.
1.1.8.1.1.5.1.1.6.1. Con: Racism's harms are felt on an emotional level. It may be very difficult for a teacher from a majority ethnic group who has never experienced racism to ever be able to fully understand the impacts of racial abuse, no matter how much they educate themselves.
1.1.8.1.1.5.1.1.6.2. Con: As this preparation is part of a teacher's job, it will need to be supported by the school by making preparatory time and materials available. This thus imposes a cost on the school as a whole.
1.1.8.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Teachers who select the book for their class likely have been trained in interpreting literature and understand the nuances of the text.
1.1.8.1.1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.1.5.1.1.5.
1.1.8.1.1.5.3. Con: The fact that not everyone will understand a text is not an argument to why a text should be censored.
1.1.8.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.2.
1.1.8.1.1.7. Con: When deciding whether to censor a text, the original intention of the language in the book is less important than the effect that the language has on the readers.
1.1.8.1.1.7.1. Con: If the purpose of censorship is to further civil rights, then censoring Mark Twain is not to the benefit of civil rights activists. The use of satire is intended to further an understanding that the N-word and racism as a whole is a bad thing.
1.1.8.1.1.7.2. Con: There is no way that any editor can determine the "effect" that words will have on another sentient being.
1.1.8.1.1.7.3. Con: When looking at the impact of language, there becomes a slippery slope. The editor would have to filter through and remove any word that someone could find offensive.
1.1.8.1.1.7.4. Pro: Readers learn from a book, or are harmed by it, based on how they interpret the language in the text, regardless of the author's intentions.
1.1.8.1.1.8. Pro: Some [interpretations](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/huckleberry-finn-and-the-n-word-debate/2/) state that the N-word was intentionally used to get the reader's attention and cause discomfort.
1.1.8.1.1.8.1. Pro: Twain used the N-word to demonstrate the negative bias in his own time--to move his society forward. As such it is a timeless piece. The juxtaposition of Jim's character with the N-word is tantamount to the power of the novel. Removing it, cheats the new reader of the insight Twain was trying to elicit. Very young readers may not understand these nuances, but are unlikely to be reading Huck Finn. Twain's work should be preserved as written.
1.1.8.1.1.8.1.1. Pro: Twain's demeaning name for Finn's companion is deliberate literary irony. Every white man that Finn meets is reprehensible in some way, in contrast to Jim's nobility. Removing the N-word eviscerates the work of the irony - so typical of Twain - which is its main device.
1.1.8.1.1.8.2. Pro: One of the most important lessons of this book and the reason it is still taught today is that it teaches that respectful treatment of fellow human beings is a choice and individuals grow up to choose for themselves even against their community.  The reader sides with Huck as he learns to respect Jim. If that shocking word weren't a given for most of his community it wouldn't mean as much when Huck later acts in defiance of others who use it, saying to himself, "All right, I'll go to Hell then."
1.1.8.1.1.8.3. Pro: Removing the word from substantially changes one of the most important aspects of the novel -- namely. that the only moral male, adult major character presented is the man that society calls the N-word, with all that word implies. The use of the word is critical and is a pointed commentary on both race and morality in American society.
1.1.8.1.1.8.4. Pro: If you remove uncomfortable words, you remove the heart of the entire premise for their use. Mark Twain didn't live in a vacuum, he understood the negative charge the N-word carried, even back then. Inclusion of the dehumanizing N-word sharply contrasts the reality of who Jim actually was, a kind, caring, noble human being, of higher character than most of the privileged whites he and Huck encountered. That one despicable word spoke volumes, both about those using it and how Jim reacted.
1.1.8.1.1.9. Pro: Mark Twain's use of the N-word is intended to highlight the way Black people were dehumanized at the time.
1.1.8.1.1.10. Pro: As a famous satirist, Twain's Huck Finn book was supposed to be satirical, employing the technique of Unreliable Narrator - ie. we're not supposed to merely take Finn's language at face value, but judge it in context of how it's presented. Readers should be allowed to judge the intent of a book beyond the immediate language it uses.
1.1.8.1.1.11. Con: Most high school students would struggle to define satire; would have no idea what it means to Bowdlerize something and would in many cases miss the nuance of the language in Huckleberry Finn. The addition of 219 N-words will do little to illuminate them in and of itself. It is possible to teach these things without the use of the N-word.
1.1.8.1.1.11.1. Con: The value and subtlety of satire is precisely what would have to be taught prior to teaching this book. To put the use of the word into context.I have not read the novel, and as such cannot testify as to how subtle the satyre is, but that merely changes the age at which it should be taught not whether it should be, in its unadulterated version.
1.1.8.2. Pro: Teachers would explain the history of the N-word, including the context of Twain's time.
1.1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.
1.1.8.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.3.
1.1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.1.5.1.1.
1.1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.7.3.
1.1.10. Pro: This concern is particularly pressing given the so-called [Trump Effect](https://www.splcenter.org/20161128/trump-effect-impact-2016-presidential-election-our-nations-schools), the documented rise of "verbal harassment, the use of slurs and derogatory language" in primary and secondary schools in 2016 and 2017.
1.1.10.1. Con: A real life political leader has a different impact on society than a piece of literature which accurately depicts historical contexts.
1.1.10.2. Con: Children see Trump mostly on media, that have business models that benefit from controversy and conflict in public space. This is different than a school. which wants to educate about facts. This does not have to be as divisive.
1.1.11. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.6.
1.1.12. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.
1.1.13. Con: Offensive words are not learned primarily by studying texts of classic American literature but are instead picked up in the schoolyard.
1.1.14. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.1.15. Con: The only way this would apply is if such words and attitudes were taught in a positive light, of which the book in question does the opposite.
1.1.15.1. Con: In fact, the usage of the term in Huckleberry Finn is quite casual, used regularly by sympathetic and unsympathetic characters alike.
1.1.15.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.2.
1.1.15.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.
1.1.16. Con: Making a subject completely taboo, without providing a formal arena of study, can make that subject more enticing than if the usage and history of the N-word were explained. The forbidden fruit is sweetest.
1.1.17. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.
1.1.18. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.6.
1.1.19. Con: -> See 1.1.7.2.
1.1.20. Pro: Children often misuse words they learn in a way that can be damaging and a parent may not want that.  As such, it may be a good idea to omit certain words at earlier ages, whereas a High School Junior or Senior may be less tempted to use those words and it may be better to introduce these words later on.
1.1.21. Pro: Insensitive students could make fun of the racial language and hurt affected classmates.
1.1.21.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.
1.1.22. Con: Censoring the language can be damaging in the future, because it does not educate a child about how harmful those words can be and how imperfect our culture has been.  We need to learn from the past so that we can avoid repeating it.
1.2. Con: To avoid racially insensitive words means to avoid a discussion about racism.
1.2.1. Pro: Racism and inequality exist, and instead of getting confronted with those problems, less-emotionally charged and drastic language withholds reality.
1.2.1.1. Con: Removing the N-word entirely would avoid a debate about the use of the N-word in class that would detract from a discussion of racism.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: We can't have Black youth hiding from a word and becoming vulnerable to it. It must be addressed directly and deliberately.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: More classtime might be dedicated to explaining why the N-word is not included. Some students might feel that this is censoring what can be taught and will be less likely to engage.
1.2.1.1.3. Con: Avoiding a debate about the use of the N-word is not a positive outcome; it is, in fact, a vital part of any discussion about racism in the modern day and its historical links. Rather than detracting from a discussion of racism, discussing the N-word and its usage now, in an academic setting or otherwise, would encourage an understanding of the import of race issues in the modern day, as opposed to students seeing them as removed, a historical relic locked in the times of Huckleberry Finn.
1.2.1.1.4. Pro: Contemporary debates about the use of the N-word often centre around whether the word can be [reclaimed](http://www.theblackinstitute.org/can_we_ever_really_reclaim_the_n_word) or if [white people](http://www.salon.com/2016/02/03/no_white_people_you_still_cant_say_the_n_word_that_word_belongs_to_black_people_and_our_culture_now_not_yours/) can use it. Since class time is limited this will distract from a discussion about the history of racism that lies behind its use.
1.2.1.1.4.1. Con: Teaching [transgressive reinscription](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PPw8DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA567&lpg=PA567&dq=transgressive+reinscription&source=bl&ots=1k_z8PzUwb&sig=cZhDnxPvI23EyveS-WzUGiguiqY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinzeWz5Y7WAhWEIMAKHfnlAg8Q6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q=transgressive%20reinscription&f=false) — where groups 'reclaim' and normalise the words used to oppress them — whilst seemingly difficult and troublesome, is understood by most people on an intuitive level already. For example, the use of 'queer' has been readily appropriated from being a slur to instead being a key term used to define one's sexual identity.
1.2.1.2. Pro: It is more important that all works of literature remain in their unaltered state for the purpose of the student not just understanding the context in which the author intended, but also for a deeper understanding of history. That doesn't mean we erect a statue and put the offensive words on it to honor the author, it means we take history and literature in their most true context. If we want students to learn critical thinking we can't censor facts.
1.2.1.3. Pro: The problem with expurgating unpopular and divisive language in in public discourse \(or works of art\) is that such a measure is not so much a 'fix' as an effort at undoing rhetorically what should be addressed systematically by educators and makers of public policy.
1.2.1.4. Pro: The derogatory words used in works like these simply reflect the time. Writing about racial issues or simply trying to portray reality of the situation merits the use of such terms, to be historically accurate. We read To Kill a Mocking bird because it is full of information and emotion that teaches us about that time in history, but we do not say that Harper Lee is a racist. It is important that works such as this exist, censorship is useless.
1.2.2. Pro: We need these kinds of works to better understand our past. Reading the word does not necessarily mean you condone the word.
1.2.3. Pro: This does nothing to address the real plight of people of color in the USA.  It is hypocritical, then, if we are proposing to censor Huckleberry Finn out of sensitivity to people of color.
1.2.4. Pro: The racial implications of the N-word need to be fully understood by future generations if we want long term equality, and that can't happen if we never let young readers be exposed to that visceral history.
1.2.5. Pro: There is a broad consensus that race categories don't exist and that the term is not biologic but sociologic. Removing "racially" insensitive terms only serves to perpetuate ignorance that these terms are mainly narrative control constructs.
1.2.5.1. Con: While it is true that race categories are primarily social, there is no clear mechanism by which bowdlerization would make them appear biological rather than social. There is thus no reason to believe misunderstandings about race would be exacerbated by removing racially insensitive terms.
1.2.6. Con: A discussion about the historical context of racism is not what is needed, this takes away class time from the racism as it exists today.
1.2.6.1. Con: Huck Finn is not a discussion of modern racism. To believe that the historical context is irrelevant is to believe that Huck Finn is irrelevant.
1.2.6.2. Con: As present racism is a consequence of the historical context, its understanding is of upmost importance to create empathy and finally, to effectively fight racism.
1.2.7. Pro: It is better for students to have the N-word discussed in an educational setting than it is to rigorously censor and have them encounter it on their own with less historical context for why the term should not be used.
1.2.7.1. Pro: I kind of like that that horrible word is in Huck Finn. It opens a discussion about how language evolves. It also preserves the historical integrity of the text. It also opens up discourse on modern language and language choices. It helps to give meaning to this terrible word as well. I think it is hugely important that we see it in literature so that we give it historical context and can teach our children why we have moved on from use of such an ugly and abusive word.
1.2.7.2. Pro: Historically rich language opens deep and provocative discussion which can nurture understanding, and creates a greater appreciation of issues like racism. To censor is to lose the opportunity to explore the greater injustice that underpins America's history. "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it" - George Santayana
1.2.7.3. Pro: Removing the N-word removes an opportunity for teachers to bring up the context about why the words are racially insensitive.
1.2.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.2.7.5. Pro: The use of racially insensitive language in texts should remain uncensored as it provides contextual evidence as to the beliefs and attitudes at the time of the work's writing/publication.
1.2.7.6. Pro: Rather than censoring \(a despicable action, especially when it comes to do so for artistic products\), I'd suggest to create annotated editions to explain the context where it was written to help teacher explain it to their pupils. The USA has had a long relationship with discrimination, and the best way to fight it is to let people know what it means for the targets rather than erasing this memory from the public debate and, in the long term, making more damage by not preparing your children.
1.2.7.7. Pro: The use of the N word is distressing, and therefore is more impactful when illustrating the racist tension of that time. Ignoring racism dilutes its horrors.
1.2.7.8. Pro: It does no good to hide from the negative aspects of the language used. Children should learn, sooner, rather than later, how things were, so they don't wind up being adults, unaware of how things were/are.
1.2.7.9. Pro: If we do censor it, we give the word power. The "n" word is only offensive because people think it is offensive. If we teach children at a young age of it's impact in history and what it means it context, it loses its power. However, if we explicitly avoid it because it is a "bad word" it remains a bad word and will still be used as such.
1.2.7.10. Pro: In the same way that pretending heroin doesn't exist won't protect kids from drug addiction, pretending racism was never or is not a thing will do nothing to prevent it from affecting children's mindsets. It will just mean they're more likely to encounter these things in a bad environment or source, unprepared.
1.2.8. Pro: Censoring words have never proven to help defeat racism. In many ways, it's only exacerbated it. Proposing better arguments have helped defeat it. Pointless to apply something that doesn't work.
1.2.9. Pro: The children that are now will be adults one day, and they will be exposed to all manner of things, from violence to racism. It is in this fase that you can make them understand why it is wrong to commit such acts. And for this, graphical exposure is very effective, and this book illustrates it well. To teach what is good you need to show what is evil.
1.2.10. Pro: Dealing with racially insensitive words means learning about societal and cultural history, as well as progress.
1.2.10.1. Pro: This book serves, in part, as a lens through which to see a racist, slave-holding society through the eyes of one of its members.  Modifying the book to make the author and/or society appear less racist interferes with this value.  Such a modified text would be inferior in an educational context.
1.2.10.2. Con: The students do not neccesarily have an understanding of racism to be able to deal with the topic. Similarly, the teacher is not a history or sociology teacher. They may not have the requisite knowledge to teach about the topic in a sensitive manner.
1.2.10.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.1.5.1.1.3.
1.2.10.3. Pro: Changing the N-word would skip a piece of the \(linguistic\) past and thus everyday life. As a result, people could start to forget this part of history.
1.2.10.3.1. Pro: The N-word is a taboo as well as a symbol for the American past. As such, it has a strong linguistic [power](http://www.huckmagazine.com/perspectives/opinion-perspectives/n-i-g-g-e-r/).
1.2.10.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.1.
1.2.10.3.2. Pro: In Huckleberry Finn, Twain captured the essence of "[everyday midwest American English](http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126852.html)".
1.2.10.3.2.1. Pro: Editing Twain's books would be changing history. The word was commonly used and a reflection of the times.
1.2.10.3.2.2. Pro: The issue is whether you want to read a sanitized version of the book or the book as the author intended it to be read.  If you want to get a sense for how people spoke, acted, and thought in previous years, you have to accept that frequently they spoke, acted, and thought in ways that might not be acceptable now.
1.2.10.4. Con: The explicit use of the N-word is not necessary to learn about society, history and progress. There are other ways of teaching these ideas.
1.2.10.4.1. Pro: Teachers could present the personal history of an American slave to contextualise the continued stigmatisation faced to this day.
1.2.10.4.2. Pro: In order to directly experience the past circumstances and social progress, students can visit historical sites and museums, or lead conversations with ancestors of slaves.
1.2.10.4.3. Pro: Students will still encounter history lessons with explanations of the practice of slavery and racial subjugation. This will spark conversations about the history of racism and its various forms.
1.2.10.5. Pro: Separating history from who we are makes meaningless our shared heritage. History is simply history and neither good nor bad. Perspective has to be maintained. Remembering slavery is vital to our shared history.
1.2.10.6. Pro: "If we do not learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it." If students read this text with a mindset that Mark Twain was writing to an audience in the late 1800s, they will realize that the n-word is just a word that was used then. There is nothing offensive about the word if we read Huck Finn to learn about our history. Slavery was a part of our history, and pretending that racism never happened will only open the door for future generations to make the same mistake.
1.2.10.6.1. Con: By the late-1800s the N-word was already a racial slur.
1.2.10.7. Pro: I don't find a need to change the realness of the dialogue in this classic book.
1.2.10.8. Pro: Literary revisions rob us of the ability to adequately understand the full scope of the timeline of social progress. Simply being told that blacks were treated poorly isn't enough. We need examples which make us deeply uncomfortable with, and ashamed of, our past transgressions. This fuels sustained progress.
1.2.10.9. Pro: Remove the language and the cultural complexity gets lost. That tends to be a lot of the point of using the book.
1.2.11. Pro: Studying the use of racially insensitive words enables readers to empathize with those who have experienced racism.
1.2.11.1. Con: Children or teenagers may not be emotionally developed enough to easily empathize with the victims of racism.
1.2.11.1.1. Pro: [Researchers say](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304561004579137514122387446) that 'perspective-taking' empathy is not fully developed until the age of 21.
1.2.11.2. Pro: Children [learn](http://www.jstor.org.tkc.idm.oclc.org/stable/1167160) through moral lessons about good and bad, imitating moral authorities and observing their reactions to certain behaviors. Having these words included shows children that using them produces bad feelings.
1.2.11.3. Pro: By reading the reaction of a character who has the N-word used against them, [we can understand](http://philosophyterms.com/humanism/) how that person feels.
1.2.11.3.1. Pro: Anti-war literature, such as '[All Quiet on the Western Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front)', '[The Hollow Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollow_Men)', '[A Farewell to Arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Farewell_to_Arms)' or '[Journey's End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey%27s_End)', brought the horrors of war to those who were not involved and therewith created understanding on the fruitlessness of war.
1.2.11.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.11.1.
1.2.11.3.3. Pro: It is easier to empathize with someone to learn that racism is bad with an example, rather than to be told racism is bad in an abstract sense. For example, the anti-slavery movement self-consciously used [literary narratives](http://empathylibrary.com/book/bury-the-chains-the-british-struggle-to-abolish-slavery) to force whites to confront the suffering slavery caused and to emphasize with the victims of that suffering.
1.2.11.3.3.1. Con: There are many other ways this 'learning by example' could be used without needing texts which are at best ambivalent towards the use of racist words. Alternatives include studying more explicitly anti-racist literature \(such as To Kill A Mockingbird\) or taking real-life historical events as examples.
1.2.11.4. Con: In the context of the book it is not clear that racism is wrong. Slavery as a norm is the moral status quo of the book.
1.2.11.4.1. Con: This is also the case in To Kill A Mockingbird where the reader [never sees the perspective of the victim](https://newrepublic.com/article/122295/these-scholars-have-been-pointing-out-atticus-finchs-racism-years). Nonetheless, the book is not criticized for being racist or seen as being unfit for students.
1.2.11.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.7.2.2.
1.2.11.4.3. Pro: Jim, the character who experiences racism, is one whose perspective we do not see.
1.2.11.4.3.1. Con: Although Huck is the narrator, Jim's voice is amply present. Indeed, Jim is arguably the [moral center](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09552360902943753?src=recsys&journalCode=casp20) of the work.
1.2.11.4.4. Con: If slavery is promoted as a moral norm, it would be a reason to censor the whole novel. Compared to the assumption of slavery as the moral status quo, the presence or absence of the N-word is comparatively unimportant.
1.2.11.4.5. Con: Even if details of racism are not in the text, it is the job of the teacher to explain the context, history and harms of racism in the book.
1.2.11.5. Con: The book is a presentation of the context of racial issues of the past, there is little discussion about how racism makes the characters experiencing it feel.
1.2.11.6. Con: If the goal of reading this piece of literature is to teach readers to empathize with the victims of racism, there are many more appropriate and effective works.
1.2.11.6.1. Con: The reason "Huckleberry Finn" is taught is because it is considered to a be a literary work of great quality.
1.2.11.6.1.1. Con: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, considered as a piece of literature, does not merit inclusion in canonical American literature, taught in the public schools. Thus, there is no need to produce a censored version of it.
1.2.11.6.1.1.1. Con: Hemingway [described](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/24/100-best-novels-huckleberry-finn-twain) the significance of the book as follows: 'All modern literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn… It's the best book we've had. All American writing comes from that. There was nothing before. There has been nothing as good since.'
1.2.11.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Even Hemingway, advised readers to stop reading after Jim is stolen from the boys, calling that "the real end of the book." But in fact, a [quarter](https://straightlinelogic.com/reviews/fiction/the-most-overrated-novel-everybody-has-read/) of the book remains.
1.2.11.6.1.1.2. Pro: As Jane Smiley [notes](http://jtbarbarese.rutgers.edu/files/2013/05/Jane-Smiley-Sayit-Aint-So.pdf), the initial elevation of Huck Finn to canonical status was a political act intended to push a conception of the American novel as socially responsible. But even on this ground, it fails: "the entry of Huck Finn into classrooms sets the terms of the discussion of racism and American history, and sets them very low: all you have to do to be a hero is acknowledge that your poor sidekick is human; you don’t actually have to act in the interests of his humanity."
1.2.11.6.1.1.2.1. Con: In the world of Huckleberry Finn, nearly every character, every situation, every bit of learning and every experience conspired to have Huck believe that his "poor sidekick" was not human. In context, Huck's change of heart does reflect a certain heroism.
1.2.11.6.1.1.2.2. Con: One legitimate reading of the novel could involve despising the hero from start to finish.
1.2.11.6.1.1.3. Con: Decisions about the place of literature in the canon aren't simply based on their aesthetic qualities. They also depend on their effectiveness in a given context. Its staying power shows the extent to which the story provides a striking introduction to important themes in American history and literature for generations of high school students.
1.2.11.6.1.1.3.1. Con: By the same token, contexts change. It may well be that Twain's story is no longer effective for a contemporary audience.
1.2.11.6.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.10.3.2.
1.2.11.6.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.6.2.
1.2.11.6.1.1.6. Con: Great literature should be taught in school and Huck Finn [certainly qualifies](http://thegreatestbooks.org/items/217). It is nearly impossible to find a list of great American novels that doesn't rank it near the top.
1.2.11.6.2. Con: Having students read these works of literature is not necessarily a mutually exclusive choice.
1.2.11.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.6.2.1.
1.2.11.6.4. Pro: '[To Kill A Mockingbird](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/16/robert-mccrum-100-best-novels-harper-lee-to-kill-a-mockingbird)' by Harper Lee would better teach students about the problems caused by historical racism in the United States.
1.2.12. Con: The reading of racially insensitive words is not needed to illustrate the ills of racism.
1.2.12.1. Con: Given that the [public use of racist discourse](http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/nigger-word-brief-history) was a defining feature of the era's systematic racism, learning these words is a necessary part of illustrating these 'ills'.
1.2.12.2. Pro: Language was a tool to oppress people. There are other examples of racial injustice that do not impact people so viscerally today - such as the institution of slavery.
1.2.13. Con: Even if all instances of the N-word were removed from "Huckleberry Finn," the racism in the book would still be clear \(for example, Huck tries to decide whether Jim is a person or a piece of property\). Thus, the book would still trigger discussions about racism.
1.2.13.1. Con: The racism will still be present, but censoring the historical wording will retroactively dull its fangs. If we are to raise a generation less racist than our own, they must be made viscerally aware of the evil of racism rather than shielded from it, lest they underestimate it and become complacent.
1.2.13.2. Con: It is arguable that these scenes would be more confusing to students without the N-word as they will lose contextual meaning.
1.2.13.2.1. Con: Schools could avoid this and substitute for a word such as "slave," such as what was done by [New South books in 2011](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/05/huckleberry-finn-edition-censors-n-word). This can still show the cruelty of denying Jim's humanity without using a word that is still relevant in its offensiveness.
1.2.13.2.1.1. Con: This would present racism as a relic of the past from the slavery era, and would deny a chance to talk about the continuation of prejudice.
1.2.13.2.1.1.1. Pro: Children need to learn about history, and in this case to not what to repeat. Teachers should teach that this is a terrible word and say why it is in the book and used in that context. Unfortunately, people were not treated same based on skin color. The book shows that and how society is changing and hopefully eventually move forward.
1.2.13.2.1.2. Pro: Alan Gribben, the editor of the New South edition, notes in the [introduction](http://www.newsouthbooks.com/twain/introduction-alan-gribben-mark-twain-tom-sawyer-huckleberry-finn-newsouth-books.html) that this substitution as often met with relief by its audience.
1.2.13.2.1.3. Con: Other than using it as a pre-emption for outright censorship, Gribben offers very little [defense](http://www.newsouthbooks.com/twain/introduction-alan-gribben-mark-twain-tom-sawyer-huckleberry-finn-newsouth-books.html) of the choice of the word "slave" as the substituting word.
1.2.13.3. Con: If this is true, that is even more a reason to keep words in the text that we consider racist because removing these words will not remove the racist notions in the text.
1.2.14. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.4.
1.2.15. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.16. Pro: Censorship removes the existence of our past. In that way, we cannot learn from our lack of love. Racist words in literature remind us of the progress we've made.
1.2.17. Pro: Teachers need the important issues contained in their teaching materials in order to teach about them.
1.2.18. Pro: When we censor historical language and events we do not prepare students to recognize the same patterns emerging in modern society. By [teaching and contextualizing](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00131857.2015.1101364?scroll=top&needAccess=true) such a word we actually remove the stigma and assign it a place in history.
1.2.18.1. Pro: Education requires context. In what context is the word used, and what was the author's intent? Does changing a single word in any way fundamentally change the story, or intent of the author? By giving students context we teach them to think critically, instead of emotionally.
1.2.18.1.1. Pro: Mark Twain published Huck Finn concurrent to the discussion whether slavery should have been abolished. He sought to provoke his contemporaries to question their convictions, which commonly included the notion that it was okay to own people. Readers should appreciate the provocative nature of the story and not dilute its intention.
1.2.18.1.2. Pro: Huck Finn, as a true classic of literature, should be taught, to higher secondary and early college students, in its original form. "Teaching" means that a teacher puts the language, sentiments, and culture in a historical context, explains the mindset of the time, and teach how that mindset has changed while pointing out why HF is a great book, and Twain a great author.
1.2.18.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.1.8.1.
1.2.18.1.2.2. Con: Teaching at its best involves critical engagement with a text, not necessarily historical contextualization, and certainly not uncritical adulation of a text or an author.
1.2.18.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.
1.3. Pro: The language of Twain is inaccessible to children and should therefore be modified.
1.3.1. Pro: The language Twain employed reflects archaic, colloquial expressions, which, when interpreted through contemporary linguistics, blur the writer's meaning and intent. To leave it unaltered undermines accessibility, and is akin to insisting the Bible only be read in its original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek to glean its meaning. Save the original for the scholars.
1.3.1.1. Con: Choice of literal language and choice of words are not the same. A better Biblical comparison would be this: to censor Huckleberry Finn is akin to leaving out the more gruesome details of the Old Testament, including rape, murder and torture. Surely nobody would argue that the Bible should be pared down in that way.
1.3.1.2. Con: In the case of the Bible, the scholarship required \(learning a complete ancient language along with context\) is a hurdle met by very few high school students. In the case of Twain's work, the threshold is much lower, including explanations of a handful of words and usage. For example, the use of the N-word may not reflect poorly on Huck's character but his priority of adventure over sensitivity to Jim's plight does.
1.3.2. Pro: Nothing should be censored for adults. However, these are kids of an impressionable age. We won't let kids read the text if it had the F-word etc.
1.3.2.1. Pro: We cannot control how children will react to seeing the N-word used in such a way. The risk that it makes a large negative impression far outweighs the chance that it will make a positively educative impression upon children.
1.3.2.2. Pro: There are aspects of certain school subjects that are partially censored so as the class can learn broad lessons without being subjected to adult material. Censoring the N-word in Huckleberry Finn is the literary equivalent of censoring explicit material in a Sex Ed. class.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: One of the stipulations of the discussion was that students would be middle to high school age. It is inaccurate to draw an analogy based on students being in first grade. Given that students are of an appropriate age to engage in discourse related to the subject matter could be a pre-requisite, but arguing for censorship based on a false analogy is a non sequitur.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: Literature is a fundamental form of art crafted with specific intention and human decision. If the subject matter is too advanced for a group of student, it should be taught to an older group of students, not adulterated. Physics is a science, its rules and quirks were not determined by a human with a specific artistic message or intention.
1.3.3. Con: High school students tend to be more mature than they often get credit for students that or in the 9th grade and up should be able to understand the context of the language in the book and relate it to how we currently view language like that. If we change the book the students lose this very important lesson.
1.3.3.1. Pro: There are appropriate ages for children to learn about sex, kidnapping, the Holocaust, the Vietnam War, slavery, colonialism, etc. Is there evidence that being exposed to this kind of writing - in an environment where its context can also be discussed - is harmful?
1.3.4. Pro: Not all great literature is age-appropriate. Thus, it must sometimes be modified to make it accessible to those ages.
1.3.4.1. Pro: This is not about censoring art; this is about teaching without those words to children who may not have a full understanding of their meaning. The book will remain in its unedited form for anyone else who wants to access it.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: The book is readily available as a [PDF](http://contentserver.adobe.com/store/books/HuckFinn.pdf) in its uncensored form.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: The book loses its important educational values if the theme of racism is removed. It would be better to not teach the book at all than to censor it for students.
1.3.4.1.3. Con: It is censoring. It is just limited to a specific audience. Quite a large audience actually as most of the readers of the book are most likely schoolkids. Even more important, it is also changing artwork. In essence it is no different as changing Romeo and Juliet ending to a happy one due to distressful nature of the original.
1.3.4.1.4. Con: The point of education is to provide understanding, not to work around lack of understanding.
1.3.4.2. Pro: That's right. For example, the Bible is often taught only in modified comic book form to children.
1.3.4.3. Con: Racism is an issue that impacts you regardless of your age, therefore it is necessary to teach about it to individuals of all ages.
1.3.4.4. Con: If a work of literature is not appropriate for a certain age group, it is better to teach it to an older, more mature age group, rather than produce a censored version.
1.3.4.4.1. Pro: Literature should be used to advance students intellectually. There are some groups of students for whom Huckleberry Finn would not achieve this end. They should read different books. But if you're going to teach Huckleberry Finn, teach Huckleberry Finn.
1.3.5. Con: Children, when given proper instruction, will better understand the true meaning of the literature being provided to them when the original text is kept. People only understand Shakespeare when it is translated for them.
1.3.5.1. Con: Shakespeare is written in English and confusing for children.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: Shakespeare is confusing for children because it is not translated in the classroom. Any text read has to be given in context \(further education on the subject\).
1.3.5.1.2. Con: Many children find Shakespeare fairly easy to follow, especially when seeing a play in live performance.
1.3.6. Pro: Redacting or blacking out offensive words could be an acceptable version for use with children too sensitive to see the actual words. It would allow the curious to ask the teacher why it was censored... the teacher could choose to share from the teacher's copy what was redacted.
1.3.7. Con: Children who do not read historically accurate novels \(The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\) are unable to excel in comparing different historic periods and have further difficulty in the use of language overall. As per [Education Week](http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1987/09/09/07200064.h07.html) understanding literature and history increase individual skills of students as well as giving them perspective.
1.3.7.1. Con: Simply modifying the N-word and one or two other slurs does not necessarily significantly alter the historical accuracy of the novel.
1.3.8. Con: The wording and expressions in the book are indeed "old" and even obsolete which could call for a new "translation" of the book for the purposes of educating less capable readers. However, this does not imply that the N-word would be in the list of words and expressions in need of alteration for better understanding.
1.3.9. Con: If a reader is not ready to read racially insensitive language, then they are not ready for the racially insensitive subject matter, and may not be ready to read Mark Twain yet.
1.3.10. Con: The point of reading "inaccessible" literature is to learn new vocabulary.  It is standard for a teacher to give the class a list of all the more uncommon or unusual words in a chapter along with their definitions for the weekly reading.  As for the N-word, it's not inaccessible. It's just a slur and is used as such in the time and place the book depicts.
1.3.11. Pro: Pretending that racial tensions never existed is preferable to having to expend the effort needed to explain that racially charged language was common.
1.4. Con: Twain's use of the N-word accurately depicts the culture and national conflict at the time. Changing that language would misrepresent history and the meaning of the text.
1.4.1. Pro: Changing these words insulates students from the context of the time, preventing them from fully understanding the work.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Twain captured a national moment and conflict. The book serves to artfully represent the true evil of slavery and white supremacy. Censorship gives power to what is censored. The stark use of the word in the modern context will further serve to undermine it.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Letting texts as they are, not only preserves the original version of the stories, but it also provides an input into the society of those days- what words were used, with what meaning, making it more easier for this generations to compare their reality with the old ones, and form opinions and conclusions.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Removing language from a book is like removing the rear view mirrors of your car because you don't like your reflection.  There isn't anything that could replace that word and still communicate the context of that period.  As a result, future generations will have an incomplete understanding of this topic.
1.4.1.4. Pro: The language and dialect used in Twain's masterpiece depicts the culture and captures the realism of America during this time. Changing the language would deface what the novel represents. It's a true depiction of America during slavery, which Twain is satirizing.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.1.
1.4.1.5. Pro: Everything in life should be taught in context. How else will we learn from our past and shape our future decisions, if we don't acknowledge how our circumstance \(context\) shape our decisions on the day.
1.4.1.6. Pro: Preserving works of art and literature as they were originally published is important when assessing the time period in which they were created, and understanding the time period they depict. Older students should not be shielded from the uglier aspects of history, but should be able to understand a period of time as it truly was, including aspects that we find horrible.
1.4.1.7. Pro: Literature is the mirror of a time. We cannot judge a book or a writer years after the novel had been written. It is unfair not to let people of today read something which is part of the history. Even comics like [“Tin-tin Au Congo”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintin_in_the_Congo), written 60 years ago, which some people want to ban, still have a place in our library.
1.4.1.7.1. Con: Young ppl use worse words in their everyday interaction. The point is not to hide content but to open the discussion about what is appropriate behavior, forms of communication & the history behind expressions.
1.4.1.8. Pro: The language should not be removed. In doing so, it overwrites history and the context of the times.
1.4.1.9. Pro: Historical literary texts are primary documents. Even a typo in a historical document should not be erased because it is part of the context in which we understand that document. The text itself informs us of its context in important ways, which cannot happen if we erase or edit details in the text.
1.4.1.9.1. Con: This proposal does not suggest editing all versions of Huckleberry Finn, which would indeed pose problems for historical research. Rather, it suggests editing versions used to teach the book in high schools. This is not where primary historical research is done anyway.
1.4.1.10. Pro: Teaching the book without the controversy would be like teaching the Merchant of Venice without anti-Semitism or teaching twentieth century history without reference to either world war - pointless and misleading.
1.4.1.11. Pro: The language in Huckleberry Finn reflects the general usage of the times. Censoring the language affects the historical perspective.
1.4.1.12. Pro: It is vitally imperative to the text that the diction used by characters is accurate to the time so that the themes may not be distracted from by misuse of language.
1.4.2. Pro: The book depicts a racially insensitive society. The insensitive word are no more offensive than the characters who use them and the society that considers them acceptable. It doesn't make sense to change some insensitive parts and leave in others.
1.4.2.1. Con: The difference is that the society has moved on, yet the word has remained the same. The word is still the same 17/18th century monstrosity it always has been.
1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.4.4. Con: Even if all instances of the N-word were removed from "Huckleberry Finn," the racism in the book would still be clearly documented.
1.4.4.1. Pro: In the book, Huck tries to decide whether Jim is a person or a piece of property. This reveals the culture of racism at the time, without even using the N-word.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: This reveals only a piece of the racism. The author felt that the N-word was another important aspect for illustration.
1.4.4.2. Con: The purpose of a novel such as "Huckleberry Finn" is not to merely document, but to give the reader a particular experience.
1.4.5. Pro: A source used in a lesson is not the person teaching it or the arrangement of content curated into the lesson. Literature teachers have a responsibility to evaluate sources and clearly explain the context of the time stories were written in. Changing a slur such as the N-word avoids the responsibility of clarifying how this less politically correct, less culturally sensitive time differs from the present day and how we got here.
1.4.6. Pro: When Looney Toons re-released some of their older, obviously racist works they did not censor them.  They instead included a disclaimer indicated the views contained in these old cartoons are wrong and abhorrent, but to ignore their existence would hide how far we have come as a community.
1.4.6.1. Pro: [The Warner Brothers Disclaimer](https://i.imgur.com/U8UZyVI.jpg), Tom and Jerry had a similar disclaimer narrated by [Whoopi Goldberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oEOdIBOpU) on Mammy Two-Shoes coming off as a stereotype of black women, mostly due to her manner of speech and being reminiscent of the [mammy archetype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammy_archetype).
1.4.7. Pro: Rather than hiding words or misrepresenting history, schools should teach students what the word meant, why it was used in history, and why it shouldn't be used anymore.
1.4.7.1. Pro: We need to acknowledge all parts of human history and even our history of racism and the racially insensitive words used. Words only have power if we give them power, and by censoring this, we our saying that it's important to disregard this word, when in reality we just need to own up to it's content in our history and accept it as part of the past.
1.4.7.2. Pro: Removing reminders of past injustices invites their repetition, and learning what it was like in that era, as literature can uniquely do, lends to empathy with those suffering from racism.
1.4.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.2.
1.4.8. Pro: The evolution of the N-word's use and cultural meaning is an important part of history, and should be taught rather than censored in this text.
1.4.8.1. Pro: Descriptors that are deemed insensitive, demeaning, and racist today did not always imply the same meaning from a historical perspective. The N-word derives from the Spanish word "negro", which at one time was simply used as a descriptor, like "white".  It wasn't until later that "negro" took on derogatory meanings.  Perhaps instead of censorship, education of the historical metamorphosis of words in our language would promote an open mind.
1.4.8.1.1. Con: Huckleberry Finn provides internal context that shapes our understanding of the meaning of the word "negro" as racist as used in the book, regardless of etymology.
1.4.8.1.2. Con: The word used in Huckleberry Finn is the full N-word, not 'negro'. The etymology of the term 'negro' is largely irrelevant.
1.4.8.1.3. Pro: "[Negro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro) \(plural Negroes\) is an archaic term traditionally used to denote persons considered to be of Negroid heritage. The term can be construed as offensive, inoffensive or completely neutral, largely depending on the region where it is used. It has various equivalents in other European languages"
1.4.8.2. Pro: Many of the great books of that era and later often use language that is of the time, and is there for us to help us understand the inherent racism of the time. \(case in point [Of Mice And Men](http://www.teenink.com/opinion/school_college/article/534583/Should-Of-Mice-and-Men-Be-Banned-Worldwide/)\)
1.4.8.3. Pro: Not only do you lose the integrity of the language of the time, but you lose the opportunity to discuss the impact of language on a wider level, and the powerful effect that using dehumanising terms and slurs can have on the behaviour of a society that allows such language to go unchallenged.  It gives great scope to think beyond the binary idea of wishy washy,PC Liberal or Rightwing Redneck.  Likeable characters may say things we abhor now, yet may still stand on the right side of history.
1.4.9. Pro: Changing historical language is equivalent to pretending that uncomfortable history does not exist.
1.4.9.1. Pro: Changing the word to save someone offense would be to pretend these things never happen. It's important to educate children on what the word means and why it's considered to be offensive. Taking it out of the book would not stop people from using the word, nor will it provide context.
1.4.9.2. Pro: To censor history is to deny that it happened.  The word exists.  It is a bastardization of the spanish word for the color black, negro, which American settlers couldn't pronounce correctly.  High-school students should not have history hidden from them, they should be taught what it means, why it was used, and why it shouldn't be used anymore.
1.4.9.3. Pro: It is a common tactic in avoiding taking action or responsibility for racism to claim it isn't actually a problem. Censoring historical literature and art would enable the denial of histyprocal racism. We shouldn't want that to happen for the same reason we don't want anyone denying the reality of the Holocaust.
1.4.9.4. Pro: Removing "objectionable" language and washing away the historical significance and power of that language as a moment in time is supremely damaging to both history and literature.
1.4.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.9.
1.4.10. Pro: That would be whitewashing of history.
1.4.11. Pro: Modifying literature written in the past to fit your political narrative is an act of intolerance associated with the most barbaric regimes. True tolerance means accepting that people today and in the past have beliefs different from our own and looking for ways to address those dispassionately without having to accept them.
1.4.11.1. Pro: We should not censor any truth, even if it's upsetting us. Only then we can be proud for being capable to overcome the bad things from our history and keep them away from coming back again.
1.4.11.2. Pro: The idea of censoring classics or modern classics should be unthinkable. We never have these discussions regarding the abuse of women, descriptions of violence, etc in such books. They serve as windows to the past, in many regards the past was barbaric, to pretend it was otherwise is to undermine the achievements which led to societies progression.
1.5. Con: Students are actively harmed by exposure to Bowdlerized texts, hamstringing them in future academic discussions of the works in college and setting them up for embarrassment when discussing these well known works of literature with others who read the uncensored text, putting them at social disadvantage.
1.5.1. Con: Omitting or changing a few words in a book is very different to banning it outright. Students \(and everyone else\) will still be able to access the original version in libraries or online if they are interested.
1.5.1.1. Con: Change the contents of a book and it is no longer the same book.
1.5.1.2. Con: This is why certain great texts, the Lord of the Rings and the Bible, for example, have morphed over the years. To this day, Tolkien's son is still trying to recreate the exact original text [ae-lib.org.ua](http://ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__the_lord_of_the_rings_1__en.htm) and the Bible is significantly different from version to version while in every version still purporting to be "the" book [i.pinimg.com](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ea/87/86/ea8786181464bffe50d530abc5653e15--king-james-bible-verses-kjv-bible-verses.jpg). Accuracy should not be sacrificed on the altar of political correctness.
1.5.2. Con: As this book is so famous, it is likely that students would have some awareness of the content before the text was discussed in class.
1.5.3. Con: The meaning of the book and its place in the history of literature will likely be clear to students even when the N-word is edited.
1.5.4. Con: Removing questionable content is a well-established practice in the field of education. There is no reason Twain's work should be treated differently.
1.5.4.1. Pro: The Diary of Anne Frank is studied extensively in schools around the world, mostly in an [abridged form](http://htmlgiant.com/random/clit-talk-removed-from-diary-of-anne-frank/) that has had sexual content removed.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: This particular example reflects a prudish attitude to discussion of sex in certain education systems. We should not view the censoring of the word as legitimate because of one example that develops from a conservative attitude.
1.5.4.1.2. Con: Removing sections from the manuscript in abridged versions undermines the significance of the text, which should remain unedited and authentic to preserve Anne Frank's memory faithfully.
1.5.4.1.2.1. Pro: The relevant sections are significant because it shows Anne Frank's development as a teenager, one with sexual desires and intrigue regarding her sexuality.
1.5.4.2. Pro: It is not unjust censorship for schools to exercise discretion on behalf of their students and curate classroom materials, even at a textual level.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: In [Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazelwood_School_District_v._Kuhlmeier), 19 years after Tinker v. Des Moines, the Supreme Court clarified their views on censorship by upholding the right of schools to censor the dissemination of content which ran counter to the school's educational mission from the curriculum.
1.5.4.2.1.1. Con: The content in Huckleberry Finn does not run counter to the school's educational mission.
1.5.4.2.2. Pro: Many school libraries ["self-censor"](http://www.slj.com/2016/09/censorship/unnatural-selection-more-librarians-self-censoring/#_) by refusing to purchase books with mature or potentially controversial content.
1.5.4.2.2.1. Con: Self-censorship at school libraries has been [criticized](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/10/how-banned-books-marginalize-children/502424/) for suppressing stories with diverse authors and content.
1.5.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: Books by or about people of color, LGBTQI people, people with disabilities, or religious and cultural minorities are often most likely to be [targeted](http://time.com/4505713/banned-books-week-reasons-change/) for removal.
1.5.4.2.2.1.1.1. Con: These concerns don't apply in the case of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, a book written by a heterosexual white male.
1.5.4.3. Pro: Although censorship is indeed dangerous, the unique importance of this particular American masterpiece makes it vital it reach young readers. It can be logically argued that removing this slur would not dilute nor compromise the integrity of this work. The greater crime would be making this book unavailable to be read or taught at all. Therefore, if the only way The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn can remain in our schools, then the word in question should be removed/altered.
1.5.4.4. Con: The existence of a historical precedent neither justifies an action nor should it be used as a standard.
1.5.4.4.1. Pro: There was historical precedent for the use of the N-word as a racial slur before it became socially taboo to use it.
1.5.4.5. Con: The First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects freedom of speech.
1.5.4.5.1. Pro: Censorship of books would deteriorate the reader's experience, as children deserve to learn about the past and learn the book in its original diction.
1.5.4.5.2. Pro: Censorship of material undermines freedom of speech and directives by public schools to publish edited versions is arguably unconstitutional.
1.5.4.5.3. Pro: The First Amendment [extends](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/319/141/case.html) to the right to distribute and retrieve literature.
1.5.4.5.4. Pro: In [Tinker v. Des Moines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_v._Des_Moines_Independent_Community_School_District), The Supreme Court upheld the principle that students in school are protected by the First Amendment. While subsequent rulings have qualified this claim, the basic principle is still recognized.
1.5.4.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.2.1.
1.5.4.5.5. Con: -> See 1.5.4.2.1.
1.5.4.5.6. Con: While the Supreme Court has upheld that students are free to access any literature in the library, that does not mean that the First Amendment prohibits schools from censoring content in books they are assigning to students, students who don't have a choice but to engage with the offensive material.
1.5.4.5.7. Pro: In [Board of Education v. Pico \(1982\),](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1981/80-2043) the Supreme Court ruled that public school boards did not have the right to ban books from school libraries, even if the books contained offensive language or content, as students have a right to access information and ideas. Censoring books in the classroom violates that same principle.
1.5.4.6. Pro: In 2013, about 49 books were banned, censored or removed from US schools' library shelves because they contain [inappropriate content](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/23/book-bannings-rise-us-censorship) for students.
1.5.4.6.1. Con: Simply restating that the practice of censorship in schools exists is not evidence that it should exist.
1.5.4.6.1.1. Con: While simply noting that censorship in the schools exists does not justify it, it does suggest that it is not inconsistent with the norms of liberal democracies.
1.5.4.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.2.2.
1.5.4.7. Con: When educators remove questionable content, it is typically because the content is classified as "obscene," typically involving sexual or otherwise inappropriate material without any redeeming qualities. It would not be justified to censor Twain's work on these grounds because Huckleberry Finn does not include this type of content.
1.6. Pro: Huck Finn is not a book for children.
1.7. Pro: Teachers feel uncomfortable and overburdened by teaching it unaltered. The quality of education is seriously affected by that.
1.7.1. Con: Teachers definitely have a responsibility to teach in a non-biased fashion.  Part of being in a Liberal society means allowing you to formulate your own opinions.
1.7.2. Con: Teachers are not supposed to read it aloud without any context. It remains important to discuss the origin and usage of specific words. And of course a teacher can ask that students not read it out loud. But it should still remain in the book.
1.7.3. Con: Many teachers are uncomfortable teaching other issues like sex ed, however, they are nonetheless often [legally compelled to do so](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-policies-on-sex-education-in-schools.aspx).
1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.1.
1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.1.2.
1.7.6. Pro: [Black teachers](https://theamericanscholar.org/teaching-the-n-word/#) in particular feel uncomfortable when dealing with the N-word and reading it aloud.
1.7.6.1. Con: A Black teacher has the opportunity to speak to the class about how the word makes her feel and clarify the difference between historic and modern usage of this word. This could be a gateway to choosing how in the future to approach this word and people of either race as individuals deserving human compassion as opposed to hatred.
1.7.6.2. Pro: The use of the N-word reminds Black teachers about their own possible experiences with racial abuse and injustices.
1.7.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.3.2.
1.7.6.2.2. Con: A teacher who has experienced racial abuse is best suited to teach the harm caused by these words.
1.7.6.2.2.1. Pro: Victims of racism can teach about its effects in a more credible and authentic way.
1.7.6.2.2.2. Con: In an educational context, the needs and resources of the teacher are also important. Teachers should not be put in a position where they feel compelled to turn their own trauma into a learning experience.
1.7.7. Pro: Some white teachers still lack empathy, as this [student-teacher interaction](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/white-kansas-professor-leave-n-word-class-article-1.2442657) about the use of the N-word in classroom shows.
1.7.7.1. Con: The removal of words from a book will have no effect on the lack of empathy of such people.
1.7.7.1.1. Pro: For teachers who lack an understanding of the ways others will experience racism throughout their lives, sanitising content will often simply further isolate them from opportunities to gain that understanding.
1.7.7.2. Con: An example showing that one teacher handled the situation badly is insufficient to justify the removal of the word in all instances.
1.7.8. Con: Teachers have a duty to the students that they teach. They should not let their personal feelings get in the way of the incredibly important job that they have in imparting a history and context of racism.
1.7.8.1. Pro: Teachers need to be able to handle complexity without feeling uncomfortable and overburdened.
1.7.8.1.1. Pro: Teaching isn't supposed to be easy. Difficult topics are best approached with a qualified unbiased guide, such as a good teacher.
1.7.8.1.2. Pro: If teachers are uncomfortable teaching it, what does that mean for the educational experience? Many uncomfortable topics come up in literature classes specifically. Often, the more uncomfortable, the more important that it be discussed and studied. Of course it's important that the appropriate context is provided to the students, and that students understand that calling a person that name is wrong. Ideally, a thorough reading of Huck Finn will demonstrate exactly that.
1.7.9. Con: For a teacher to repeat a word from a book does not imply that they agree with the word's use.
1.7.9.1. Pro: When a teacher asks their students to study Mein Kampf, no one assumes that they are endorsing Hitler's racist ideology.
1.7.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.1.5.1.1.
1.8. Pro: Schools have a duty to protect their students who are still minors from distressing content.
1.8.1. Con: Surely reading the N-word in a fictional novel can't be more distressing than being taught about the history of slavery in history class.
1.8.1.1. Con: It depends on the situation. The history of slavery is history. If you as a student are told to read a racist fictional novel today, without context or criticism, that is an oppression right now.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.2.
1.8.2. Con: Students already know what the word is. Censoring it will not protect them from the word, but it does increase the sense that they "ought" to be distressed by it, and therefore the likelihood that they will feel discomfort.
1.8.3. Con: 'Huckleberry Finn' deals with many adult topics, such as slavery, murder, and domestic violence. If students are smart enough to discuss topics such as these, then we should also be able to trust them to have the discussion about when and if language is appropriate.
1.8.4. Con: Protecting minors from "distressing content" will never be fully effective. Therefore, it is more important for schools that they prepare their students to deal with such content then trying to keep them from it.
1.8.5. Con: Schools don't have to have a censored version of a book to protect students from distressing content; they can simply choose to not use or provide the book in the first place.
1.8.6. Con: -> See 1.2.18.1.
1.8.7. Con: Hiding or disguising information that is uncomfortable to students, teachers, staff or parents is a poor alternative to providing open and transparent education to our school children. Education must be more resilient to "social norms". Political correctness should not be a factor in determining what should or should not be presented to the student.
1.8.8. Con: Students do not need to be protected from words.
1.8.8.1. Pro: Giving words more power than they deserve is very dangerous. Obviously this doesn't mean that we should promote offensive language, but no word should be treated as something that people need protection from.
1.8.8.1.1. Con: [Slurs](http://www.iep.utm.edu/pejorati/) are intended to cause harm.  The group who should be enjoined not to give them power is thus those who employ them, not those who are the target of them.
1.8.8.2. Pro: It is important to teach people that words are powerless unless we ascribe power to them. Exposure to inflammatory words, when presented with logic and critical thinking, is an important part of learning.
1.8.8.2.1. Pro: Words only have power over us as far as we give them permission to influence our emotions.
1.8.8.3. Pro: The usage of the N-word in a work of fiction should not be considered distressing content. This is because it isn't used to insult anyone reading the book.
1.8.8.3.1. Con: Content \(graphic descriptions, offensive language, or otherwise\) can be distressing to young students even if it does not imply a personal insult.
1.8.8.3.2. Con: Slurs are general terms. That is they can be used to refer to people who are not the intended original recipients. This feature of how general terms means that people can feel personally attacked by racial slurs in Huckleberry Finn.
1.8.8.3.3. Con: Children that grow up in terrible conditions, e.g. in refugee cities in Sudan do not warrant not improving the situation for children in the US. Some having it even worse than others does not warrant inaction for those with facing smaller hardships.
1.8.9. Con: Education regarding both the historical and literary context in which the words are used should be perfectly sufficient to deter harm.
1.8.10. Pro: The racial language in Huckleberry Finn is inherently inflammatory, distressing, and offensive.
1.8.10.1. Con: This is sort of the point; The idea is to allow readers to understand how Blacks were dehumanized in the time of the story.
1.8.10.2. Con: A word in itself cannot be anything but a symbol. What it refers to, and what is infered from it depends to a large extent on context and intention. In such way that the meaning of a word cannot be "inherently" anything.
1.8.10.2.1. Pro: Students will be aware that what they are reading is a classic American novel. Because it was written so long ago, the students will be able to distance themselves from the language used in the text and therefore avoid feeling distressed.
1.8.10.2.1.1. Pro: Most teens are able to understand that the n-word is being used in a book, and that the book is fiction, and therefore is not meant to offend or attack any demographic.
1.8.10.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.7.1.
1.8.10.2.3. Con: The N-word has been associated with the inferiority of Black people for [over 200 years](http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/nigger-word-brief-history).
1.8.10.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.2.3.
1.8.10.2.4. Con: The historical connotations of the N-word generates "a cultural discomfort" that Black Americans share with "no other racial group" [\(Henry, p. 31\)](http://www.mercerislandschools.org/cms/lib3/WA01001855/Centricity/Domain/640/Allen%20Carey-Webb%20Huck%20Finn.pdf).
1.8.10.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.
1.8.10.3. Con: I don't believe that there have been any empirical studies of the benefit or harm to high schoolers from reading books like Huck Finn. In the absence of any evidence it makes sense to defer to the judgment of teachers - all of whom have degrees in education.
1.8.10.4. Con: To the extent it is inflammatory, distressing, and offense, it must be being taught without context.  The reason we teach with such tools is to encourage students to consider their history, and its context.  Students should learn to 'ask why the word is being used?', as it provides opportunity to learn.
1.8.10.4.1. Pro: A more reasoned discussion of the word would highlight the origin of the word and how it gradually transformed to likely adopt a dialect in pronunciation. The word of origin was negro, which in of itself was not a word that implied "slave." Given a southern and Cajun dialect then, the word could have developed as "spell it like you hear it" from the way it was pronounced. Understanding this could remove the attached stigma.
1.8.10.5. Con: What truly makes a word offensive is the meaning behind it, not the sound you make when conveying the idea. Using the N-word is the basically the same as saying "dark skinned person, which makes you less than"; the idea is what is reprehensible, whether you use one word or a series of words to convey it, but because one is merely considered a "swear word", it's seen as somehow more objectionable.
1.8.10.6. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.2.3.
1.8.10.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.1.
1.8.10.8. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.2.4.
1.8.10.9. Con: -> See 1.1.7.2.
1.8.10.10. Pro: If we want our children to read the book, the N-word needs to be replaced. It is too offensive and hurtful and there is no need to introduce it to our children.
1.8.10.10.1. Con: Short of editing the book, there are alternatives that would take care of the concerns raised regarding its problematic language.
1.8.10.10.1.1. Con: While these alternatives do help to contextualize the work, they do not address the core concerns about use of the N-word itself in the classroom as a sanctioned part of the curriculum.
1.8.10.10.1.2. Pro: Partial censorship of words without editing the book, such as censoring the vowels or censoring all but the first and last letters can allow students to recognize the word while reducing shock value.
1.8.10.10.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.
1.8.10.10.1.4. Pro: There should be no censorship of any book. It's an insult to the author. A rating system as we have for movies and video games would be preferable to indicate that some of the contents are problematic by today's standards.
1.8.10.10.1.4.1. Con: A ratings system is a form of censorship. If the state classifies a Film as "15" it is effectively censoring that film for people under the age of 15.
1.8.10.10.1.4.1.1. Con: Classification systems merely restrict access to certain works; they do not censor or outright prohibit them.
1.8.10.10.1.5. Pro: One approach is to allow students to read the word in the text, but refuse to read/use the word aloud in class and ask students not to use it as well.
1.8.10.10.1.5.1. Con: Asking students not to use the word in class is censorship. The parent is effectively arguing for the thesis here, not against it.
1.8.10.10.1.6. Pro: A disclaimer could be added to the book's foreword contextualizing the time and place of its story.
1.8.10.11. Pro: Regardless of intent, opening impressionable young people to racially charged language without filter creates opportunity for conflict on the playground.  If literature is not affirming to all students in middle/high school it ought not be taught.  Save Huck Finn for specialized courses in university.
1.8.10.11.1. Con: The goal for raising youth is not to protect them, it's to prepare them. Their job is to guard the future from the mistakes of the past. Lord of the Flies is disturbing. Fahrenheit 451 is disturbing. To Kill a Mocking Bird is disturbing. Unless we want a repeat of Nazi Germany, we need youth to lose their innocence and come to grips with the dark side of human nature. Otherwise, they'll think a dystopian future can't happen right up until the moment it does.
1.8.11. Pro: Censoring the N-word is consistent with schools' duty of care to their students.
1.8.11.1. Pro: Schools have a [responsibility to protect](http://www.lawhandbook.org.au/04_08_03_bullying_and_assault/) students from bullying and harassment.
1.8.11.1.1. Con: A piece of literature can neither harass nor bully a person. This would have to imply that Mark Twain is harassing or bullying students.
1.8.11.1.2. Pro: It is possible to regard the use of slurs and obscene language as [harrassment](https://www1.eeoc.gov/laws/types/harassment.cfm) per se.
1.8.11.2. Con: The duty of care does not necessarily imply the duty to remove all distressing content.
1.8.11.2.1. Pro: For example, it may be appropriate and in accordance with their duty of care for teachers to provide access to content containing the N-word in a supporting environment.
1.8.11.2.1.1. Pro: There is an important distinction between content which may be uncomfortable to learn/teach \(eg. Sex Ed.\) and content which is harmful. Teaching the history of Racism is the former and not the latter.
1.8.11.3. Pro: At one school, the Code of Conduct [states](https://www.ruyton.vic.edu.au/public/files/files/Child%20Safety%20Code%20of%20Conduct%20web%2012_07_16.pdf) that any persons working with its students will 'not use offensive, profane, discriminatory or abusive language towards or in the presence of children'.
1.8.11.3.1. Con: This clause must be read to refer to instances when teachers are offensive towards children or other people.
1.8.11.3.2. Con: It would be impossible for teachers to completely remove exposure to profane language as films or texts taught in higher school levels frequently contain offensive or discriminatory language.
1.8.11.3.3. Con: The policies of one school do not dictate the policies of all schools or their curricula.
1.8.12. Pro: Article 29 of ['The UN Convention On The Rights Of The Child'](https://www.unicef.org/southafrica/SAF_resources_crcgeneralcomments.pdf) calls for education to "promote a culture infused with appropriate human rights values".
1.8.12.1. Con: Articles 13 and 14 protect Freedom of Thought and Expression. This includes artistic expressions and racist language.
1.8.12.2. Con: A singular word cannot degrade a culture
1.8.12.3. Con: Article 29 of the UN Convention On The Rights Of The Child is also interpreted by the committee with responsibility for the convention to entail teaching about [racism.](https://www.unicef.org/southafrica/SAF_resources_crcgeneralcomments.pdf)
1.8.12.4. Con: Under Article 29, there is a distinction between merely teaching material with racist elements and the teaching that promotes the [distorted values of racism.](https://www.unicef.org/southafrica/SAF_resources_crcgeneralcomments.pdf)
1.8.12.5. Pro: Teaching students content that includes racial slurs, even in the context of literature, would not create an environment "infused with appropriate human rights values".
1.8.12.5.1. Con: It is not against human rights values to teach about something which does not respect human rights values. For example, we often teach about atrocities in schools to demonstrate that they are wrong.
1.8.12.5.2. Con: Denial of human history is dangerous if we want to uphold "human right values".
1.8.12.6. Con: -> See 1.8.12.5.1.
1.8.12.7. Con: Article 29 has never been interpreted as justification for censoring Huckleberry Finn \(or any other book in any country it has been ratified\), although it has been in effect since [2 September 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child).
1.8.12.7.1. Con: That an existing law, which could be interpreted to support censoring the N-word in Huckleberry Finn, has not yet been used to censor it or to support censoring it, does not justify dismissing the claim that it should be used that way.
1.8.12.7.1.1. Pro: [Art 5](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/13/us/after-attacks-alliance-for-first-time-nato-invokes-joint-defense-pact-with-us.html) of the NATO treaty was never interpreted to include terrorist attacks. Yet, once the World Trade Center was attacked in 2001 the US invoked it for this purpose. Apparently existing laws can be used for new contexts.
1.8.12.7.1.2. Pro: [Article 29](https://www.unicef.org/crc/files/Rights_overview.pdf) says: "Children’s education should develop each child’s personality, talents and abilities to the fullest. It should encourage children to respect others, human rights and their own and other cultures.". The usage of the N-word in Huckleberry Fin could be viewed as prohibiting children from fully developing and could teach children to be show less respect.
1.8.12.7.1.2.1. Pro: Children need to feel safe in order to be able to grow and develop properly. Reading the N-word in Huckleberry Finn may make some children feel uncomfortable enough to have a hard time to develop.
1.8.12.7.1.2.2. Pro: The usage of the N-word in Huckleberry Finn displays a derogatory and disrespectful view towards African-Americans. Children may internalize this type of behavior when reading the book.
1.8.12.8. Pro: A treaty like [the Convention on the Rights of the Child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child) articulates widely agreed upon norms amongst liberal democracies like the United States pertaining  to proper treatment of children.
1.8.13. Pro: Given the increased awareness of what an intensely offensive word the N-word is, the bowdlerized word "slave" might more accurately convey the level of shock Twain intended: "Twain may have meant to shock, but I don’t think he ever intended for the word to completely swamp the reader’s emotional reaction to the book. Today, though, that’s exactly what it does." \([Drum](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/01/bowdlerizing-huck/), 2011\)
1.8.13.1. Con: The most accurate text is the unaltered text.

One can always add clarification as a footnote, if one thinks the unaltered text might spark confusion, though.
1.8.13.2. Con: There is no "increased awareness" of the offensiveness of the word. The word was offensive when the book was published, and now readers have vastly more context against which they might interpret it.
1.8.14. Con: It is possible to allow a student who would be particularly distressed by a word to leave the classroom before the discussion of the text.
1.8.14.1. Con: A student would likely not know how they would react in the situation until they are in it.
1.8.14.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.
1.8.14.1.2. Pro: Class discussions using the N-word are more impactful to students than reading the word in the textual context. Hearing it spoken is likely to have a greater psychological impact on students than through reading it.
1.8.14.2. Pro: Some Catholic schools in Ireland already follow this practice during other sensitive topics, [such as religious education](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/just-1-of-students-opt-out-of-religion-classes-in-catholic-schools-1.2910814).
1.8.14.3. Con: By generally allowing pupils to leave class at any time of potential distress we would quickly generate a filter bubble, thus failing in educational objectives of discovery, exposure, debate, comprehension of context, acceptance of diversity of points of view and more.
1.8.14.4. Con: This unfairly burdens the students who should not be placed in a distressing situation in the first place.
1.8.14.4.1. Con: School is MEANT to put students in situations of gradually gradually greater distress, as to form people who are resilient to the evil and petty world outside. A student can always raise his hand and be explained by the professor WHY the word is so common in the text.
1.8.14.4.2. Pro: A student might not want to seem as if a word is hurting them so may opt to stay so as not to draw attention to themselves in front of their peers.
1.8.14.5. Con: Students may be disadvantaged in assessments if they have not studied the text.
1.8.14.5.1. Pro: Schools [do not have the resources](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2012/11/25/how-grossly-underfunded-are-public-schools/?utm_term=.0cb6455f1703) to offer supplementary classes to students who wish to leave class, meaning these students lose valuable educational opportunities in English language and critical thinking skills.
1.8.14.5.2. Con: It would be possible for teachers to write supplementary exams for students without including The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
1.8.14.5.2.1. Con: Teachers cannot control the content of national standardized tests.
1.8.14.5.2.1.1. Pro: Huckleberry Finn continues to be heavily featured on the Advanced Placement American Literature [exam](http://www.arrowheadschools.org/faculty/freeburg/WORKS%20LISTED%20ON%20AP%20ENGLISH%20LITERATURE%20EXAM.pdf). This makes it virtually unavoidable in standardized tests for high performing and honors students.
1.8.14.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.14.5.2.1.1.
1.8.14.6. Con: A student may decide to leave the classroom for a reason other than the use of the N-word in the classroom, but rather to avoid class. This undermines the validity of students opting out of class and may result in suspicious teachers.
1.8.14.7. Con: -> See 1.8.14.4.2.
1.8.15. Pro: Schools are regarded both legally and morally as functioning [in loco parentis](http://usedulaw.com/345-in-loco-parentis.html); this includes a duty to protection children from harm.
1.8.15.1. Con: There is no basis to suffer psychological harm or feel intimidated when the N-word isn't used to wound another or to put down someone.
1.8.15.1.1. Pro: To use versions, not apparently bowdlerized grants students the opportunity to develop more independence in their thinking.
1.8.15.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.2.
1.8.15.1.3. Con: For Black students it might be hurtful to hear a non-Black teacher use the N-word. [Many regard](http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/03/white-people-cant-use-the-n-word/) the use of the word as only acceptable if you are Black.
1.8.15.1.3.1. Pro: Whites are [overrepresented](https://www.edweek.org/media/pot2011final-blog.pdf) as teachers compared to the general American population. Indeed, the unexamined structural experiences of [whiteness](https://www.macalester.edu/educationreform/publicintellectualessay/ElissaV.pdf) has been identified as a major barrier to education in minority schools.
1.8.15.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.1.2.
1.8.15.1.4. Con: When Black students were exposed to racist opinions \(even if the students were not directly targeted\) or received reminders of a stigmatized identity, it [harmed](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103109002212) their executive functioning and depleted their self-control resources.
1.8.15.1.4.1. Con: This understanding of harm undermines the notion of free speech. That historically has shown to be a good idea to protect marginalised groups.
1.8.15.1.4.1.1. Pro: Similar applications of attempts to protect marginalised groups through limiting free speech, can often have the opposite effect of the intended one. [Hate speech legislation](http://freespeechdebate.com/discuss/the-harms-of-hate-speech-legislation/) has been used by the majority to vilify the minority the legislation aims to protect.
1.8.15.1.4.1.2. Pro: Harming the foundation of freedom of speech is detrimental to marginalized minorities as the majority can easily limit their freedoms.
1.8.15.2. Con: Regardless of whether schools possess this duty, they cannot legally express it by censoring books.
1.8.15.3. Pro: Unlike college, secondary education is compulsory. Because students have no choice, they should not be forced to study works containing inflammatory language.
1.8.15.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.10.
1.8.15.3.2. Con: -> See 1.8.14.
1.8.15.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.11.3.
1.8.16. Con: The goal of education is to prepare students for the wider world. In the real world, there is no protection from distressing content.
1.8.16.1. Pro: Keeping students 'protected' from distressing content will only serve to make their first experiences with it later in life all the more distressing.
1.8.16.1.1. Pro: Students have teachers available to explain distressing content, whereas there will not typically be an authority present to help them process and learn to deal with racism later in life.
1.8.16.1.2. Pro: The more experience a person accumulates, the better prepared they will be to handle that experience well in the future.
1.8.16.1.3. Con: Whether or not it's more distressing later, older, more mature individuals will be better equipped to handle these stresses.
1.8.16.2. Pro: The schools have a duty to prepare students for their future adulthood. Guiding minors through distressing content in a school context is the best way to help them develop into prepared adults.
1.8.16.2.1. Pro: Schools have the opportunity to add context not readily available in the adult world. They are able to explain to students why the N-word is harmful and its context in the world.
1.8.16.2.2. Pro: Learning the reality of the time is a harsh lesson, but harsh lessons should be learned and must be dealt with in the classroom and in everyday life.
1.8.16.2.3. Pro: Schools have a responsibility to strengthen the minds of students. That means encountering distressing texts and learning to deal with them in a context of greater struggles and morals associated with them. You only gain strength by encountering stress, be it muscles or mind.
1.8.16.3. Con: There is protection from certain kinds of distressing content, even in the world outside of school.
1.8.16.3.1. Pro: The sale and marketing of certain books, including [American Psycho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psycho#Controversy), is severely restricted in many countries to prevent minors from accessing explicit content.
1.8.16.3.2. Pro: There are, in fact, ways to avoid distressing content - word filters on Internet browsers, avoiding certain websites, not hanging out with assholes...
1.8.16.4. Pro: Schools have a duty to teach students while preventing permanent and physical harm. Any distress caused by Huckleberry Finn is likely to be temporary and eventually help the student develop and be educated.
1.8.16.5. Con: It is bad to prepare students for the real world by exposing them to racist language because that process of education legitimizes and increases the use of racist language.
1.8.16.5.1. Pro: If presented carelessly, which one should expect to happen, then yes. Using racial slurs without context legitimizes them, especially when an authority figure is using them.
1.8.16.5.2. Con: If presented in proper context, which an educator ought to do, then no. Quoting a person to make a point or inform someone is not legitimizing the language they used. Furthermore, to do otherwise sends the message that this material is to be feared or fetishized, rather than dealt with frankly.
1.8.16.5.3. Con: It is unlikely that -with all the media nowadays- even young children haven't encountered the N-word or similar before.
1.8.16.5.4. Con: Reading about evil things does not necessarily have the effect of making those things seem normal. Students may also read about the Nazis murdering Jews and homosexuals, but that does not make it seem ok to them.
1.8.16.5.5. Con: Schools don't exist to stop people being racist, they exist to make children strong.
1.8.16.6. Con: If the text causes distress to a student, they may be unable or unwilling to participate in a discussion about the text with the class.
1.8.16.6.1. Con: The goal of school is to confront difficult and challenging situations when it is safe, as a "practice" for the real world they will confront as adults. One of the educational benefits of Huckleberry Finn is learning to participate in a respectful discussion about controversial and distressing material.
1.8.16.6.2. Pro: If so, the student would lose valuable educational opportunities which could have a profound impact in their engagement with studies in the future.
1.8.16.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.14.5.
1.8.16.7. Pro: The internet makes distressing and explicit content unavoidable, even for children.
1.8.16.7.1. Pro: Children who even search online for The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will find discussions about the N-word. This means that despite all attempts to protect the students, they are going to be exposed to the language anyway and without the support of a teacher to help the student comprehend the meaning of the word in the context of the text.
1.8.17. Pro: Teachers have an ethical duty to protect their students.
1.8.17.1. Con: The duty does not extend to protecting students from the history and the reality of racism.
1.8.17.2. Pro: To protect students one must teach them the realities of the world, which include discrimination. By teaching accurate historical texts, one provides an understanding of historic interactions of people.
1.8.17.3. Pro: The duty of teachers to protect their students is affirmed by numerous [professional](http://www.nea.org) [teaching](http://aaeteachers.org/) [organizations](http://nasdtec.net).
1.9. Pro: Studying texts in the curriculum which repeatedly include racist language nullifies important humanistic achievements in education.
1.9.1. Con: No, it teaches us about what human beings are capable of, good and bad.  To truly know oneself, we also need to know human nature and what we can be capable of when lead astray and when left unchecked.  To acknowledge the things in the past that got us here today and analyzing them is the ONLY way to truly bring about change.  The fact that they are repeatedly brought up only serves to let the point sink in the way it should, not just as a footnote or afterthought.
1.9.2. Con: To censor out the horrors of that era from the literature of that era, only serves to disrespect, undermine, erase and minimize what they went through, for nothing.
1.9.3. Con: Exposing children to the fact that norms and morality have and do change over time teaches them to examine the norms and morality of their own time, thus furthering social and individual progress. It also teaches them to appreciate how far society has come.
1.9.4. Pro: Humanistic education [seeks](http://www.humanismforschools.org.uk/pdfs/Discrimination%20and%20Prejudice%20\(final\).pdf) to foster relationships "regardless of race, nationality, age, sex, religion or appearance" without prejudice and discrimination.
1.9.5. Pro: Humanistic education [values](http://facultyweb.cortland.edu/andersmd/HUMAN/PRINC.HTML) a safe nonthreatening environment for students to afford them the greatest opportunity to explore learning and understanding their environment. Racist language is contrary to these values.
1.9.5.1. Con: Careful what you try and protect your students from.  To think that they would be threatened by a piece of historic literature is an insult to any well adjusted student.
1.9.6. Con: Humanistic education is but [one form of education](https://www.learning-theories.com/) and does not reflect the methodology of education taught in every school.
1.9.7. Pro: Humanistic education [values](http://vichumanist.org.au/policy-principles/) tolerance and respects the rights of individuals to have their own beliefs. Racism is contrary to these values.
1.9.7.1. Con: While racism may be contrary to these humanistic values, it does not necessarily follow that all discussions of race, or even all mentions of racism, are.
1.9.8. Con: Humanistic education [believes](http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/probe/docs/psy-educ.html) that right and wrong are subjective and derived from within the individual. Exposure to a variety of belief systems, including potentially hurtful ones, may be necessary for students' journeys of self-discovery.
1.9.8.1. Pro: If humanistic education believes that right and wrong are subjective, then individuals/societies who believe that racism is right and educated according to that belief would be consistent with their humanistic values.
1.9.8.2. Con: Humanistic education is subjective in the sense that it values the ability of the individual to pursue their own ideas and self-discovery. In so far as racism impedes the ability of individuals to pursue education and self-discovery it is contrary to the values of humanistic education.
1.9.9. Con: Schools should not implement the values and methods of humanistic education.
1.9.9.1. Pro: A meta-analysis of 150 studies of humanistic education [showed](http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/files/hillexm3.pdf) "no consistent effect on math, reading, or other types of academic achievement." If the values of humanistic education do not prepare students for academic and career success, they should be re-evaluated.
1.9.9.2. Pro: A meta-analysis of 150 studies of humanistic education did not show the [increase](http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/files/hillexm3.pdf) in student self-control and self-concept that proponents expected.
1.9.9.2.1. Con: Students of teachers using a [highly facilitative style](http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/files/hillexm3.pdf) of humanistic education demonstrate an increased sense of self-concept, stronger academic achievement, and fewer disciplinary problems.
1.9.10. Pro: Humanistic values are of high significance for the Amercian education system and ultimately related to a democratic, free and open society \([Koopman, p. 246](http://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/jcs/jcs_1987spring_koopman.pdf)\).
1.9.11. Con: On the contrary, censorship is a big step back for humanistic achievements such as the notion of free speech.
1.9.12. Con: Those who do not remember history are doomed to repeat it. Redacting this historic work will not only impede our development, but potentially set us back. Removing a few impactful words will remove the impact of the text, and set us on a track to retrace steps better left to historic books.
1.10. Con: -> See 1.2.11.6.1.1.
1.11. Con: It is important to preserve the artistic integrity of great works of art like Huckleberry Finn. As such, none of its language should be modified.
1.11.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.11.2. Pro: The study of art should encompass ALL of it, its beauty, its sweetness, its bitterness and its controversies, censoring them is like telling a student that swords were handles screwed to a layer of steel without pointing out the sharpness of it.
1.11.3. Pro: Changing the composition of any literary work is defiling the material. This causes the theme, context, and literary/historical importance to become misconstrued. Thus, censoring any material is just harming the society.
1.11.4. Pro: Modifying or "washing" any art, historical or otherwise, is manipulating the intent of that original work. History isn't always comfortable.
1.11.5. Pro: Censoring never ends up in a good way. Any change of the text will lead to further misconceptions about the intent of the author.  Historical texts should remain in its original form, as it gives the insight how people thought back in those times. We can't really learn, from mistakes of the past if we keep censoring stuff. Good idea is to add preface or some sort of explanation under the text.
1.11.6. Pro: Languages change over time, and it's important to understand the context of one time in history vs. another. Tracking linguistic evolution helps with that.
1.11.7. Pro: It is also important for people to understand how a word that may not have been inherently offensive to begin with, becomes offensive through context, culture and use.
1.11.8. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.10.1.
1.11.9. Pro: Using a racial slur in a piece of literature is an artistic statement made by the author of the text. Censoring the N-word to protect teachers or students would just become an even bigger controversy over what people are trying to protect students from.
1.11.10. Pro: The book was what it was, and it was a piece of art. Would we censor the breasts of "La Liberté guidant le peuple," or Reuben's painting of Cronos?
1.11.11. Pro: Instead of censoring and modifying classic literature, different texts without racially insensitive words can be used in the classroom.
1.11.11.1. Pro: The text should be read as it is written; if you do not like it, do not read it. History does not change.
1.11.12. Pro: If we are to show other generations the racism as it existed, we should not censor these words. Books like Huckleberry Finn should be taught from a rhetorical perspective talking about how that language is offensive and how the word was treated then versus how we should treat it now. Censoring this language would not be true to the historical Mark Twain as an author. Readers should have  a choice to understand his literature as they perceive it themselves and make their own ethical conclusions.
1.11.13. Pro: To censor an author's vulgarity or distasteful expression is to submit the author to the criticisms of only those who decided upon the censoring, rather than allowing them the basic right of being judged for their free speech by all who may hear or read it.
1.11.14. Con: The artistic integrity of Huckleberry Finn is not irreversibly compromised by substituting one word \(which makes up 0.2% of the total word count\) with an inoffensive substitute.
1.11.14.1. Pro: Minor changes to art works that happen in [restoration](http://www.vanwittart.com/how-restoration-improves-the-value-of-work/) are generally not seen as detrimental to the artistic value.
1.11.14.2. Pro: It happens that artwork is contextualized to the society it works in. During the times of Pliny, for example, the Shrine of Ceres was refurbished and adapted to the society's current perception without destroying its identity.
1.11.14.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.
1.11.14.4. Con: The thematic impact of literature is a considerable part of its artistic merit and educational value. If the word being substituted is a vital part of establishing the core thematic elements through setting and character relationships, then it does, in fact, violate the artistic integrity and educational value of the novel.
1.11.14.5. Con: As a general rule, altering one word changes the entire meaning of the text in a sense. [Bayreuth University](http://www.anglistik.uni-bayreuth.de/en/Studium/Intro__Material_LIT/meaning/index.html) claims that addition or subtraction of text changes the context of the entire work.
1.11.15. Pro: Classic Literature should stand as it is. When I created an art display at Douglas MacArthur's waterhole in Morotai, Indonesia, I wished I could change the word "men" to the non gender specific word "humanity" in quotes form MacArthur and Robert Menzies. But I didn't dare.
1.11.16. Pro: Mark Twain was a rabid abolitionist. His use and wild overuse of the slur actually demonstrates his strong distaste for it. He used it to shock his audience. Huck starts out a foolish ignorant child whose humanity grows through his coming to know and empathize with Jim. This is a major action in the novel. If high school students cannot grasp this when it is presented this way, maybe save the work for college students, but please don't damage the work.
1.11.17. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.1.8.
1.11.18. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.1.
1.11.19. Pro: The opening line of the musical Showboat was modified over the years, which distorted the meaning and context of the piece. Originally, the line was “N- all work on the Mississippi…” then “Colored folks work…” then “Darkies work…” and finally the chorus was eliminated. The censorship of the N-word effectively led people to ignore the past as the musical’s final form did not the depict the fact that Black people were forced to work.
1.11.20. Pro: [Huckleberry Finn](http://articles.latimes.com/2010/nov/14/entertainment/la-ca-mark-twain-20101114) is considered to be the source of modern American literature introducing a new kind of American language.
1.11.20.1. Con: -> See 1.11.14.
1.11.21. Pro: One of the things students can learn from reading and discussing this book is that very few things are all good or all bad. Even hateful words that are to be avoided in most contexts, can have some value in the right context.
1.11.22. Pro: If the words are too difficult for the students to handle, then do not use the material as teaching material. The whole topic of racism could be introduced without Huck Finn's language becoming a side issue. It is often used as an example of a cultural work that contains offensive language.
1.11.22.1. Con: Children do not get to choose what material is taught to them so they cannot do anything to prevent Huckleberry Finn from being used in teaching.
1.11.23. Pro: Racist slurs can function in non-racist even progressive ways. \( [Zizek on Racism](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=p4YJAs6Cv9I) \)
1.12. Pro: African-American students reading the text could suffer harm or feel intimidated.
1.12.1. Con: -> See 1.8.15.1.
1.12.2. Con: -> See 1.8.10.2.1.
1.12.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.15.1.4.
1.12.4. Con: Trying to protect students from hearing offensive words may create an environment of hate and intimidation, where one side presses for censorship, and the other side presses against it.
1.12.5. Con: Assuming a need for special protection is insulting and paternalistic; therefore, teachers should not make decisions about curriculum in order to avoid hurting a group's feelings.
1.12.6. Pro: The story takes place in a society that devalues Black members and thinks them as less than human.  It is the exact opposite of social empowerment for Black students because there is no Black character who is rewarding to be and Jim's kindness to Huck has a tone which supports white privilege and the devaluation of Black people.
1.12.7. Pro: Students might have been targeted by racial slurs and prejudice in ways reminiscent of what is described in the book, so it might be harmful to have to listen to experiences so similar to their own.
1.12.7.1. Con: Students who experience racism can use the study of history and literature to contextualize their experiences.
1.12.7.2. Con: It is just speculation to assume that revisiting an experience, would be deepening the supposed adverse effects of the real experience.
1.12.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.3.2.
1.12.7.4. Con: Possible psychological harm is not a good enough reason to use a bowdlerised version. With a vague, unsubstantiated amount of injury supposedly inflicted by having the original edition as part of the planned curriculum.
1.12.7.5. Con: Children need to learn to deal with abrasive behaviour of other children, remember the adage sticks and stones. If we move away from that we do our children no good, thing is, we teach them that instead of learning to deal with abrasive language, that trowing a fit will take away offensive things, this will not help them.

And there is no correlation between children learning how to deal with abrasive language and ADHD, rather the opposite is true. Sheltering makes them weaker.
1.12.8. Pro: -> See 1.8.16.6.
1.12.9. Pro: Hearing their teachers and peers repeat racist slurs, even in an "academic" context, would create an intimidating environment for a minority student.
1.12.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.3.
1.12.9.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.
1.12.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.
1.12.9.4. Con: Avoiding the creation of an intimidating environment is not a sufficient reason to censor works, because it comes at the cost of preventing knowledge about the unpleasant truths of history.
1.12.9.4.1. Con: Students surely know that the N-word existed in the past. They are aware of the truth already.
1.12.10. Pro: -> See 1.8.15.1.3.
1.12.11. Con: Not all levels of offense necessarily warrant censorship, however. For example, while acknowledging that his \(predominantly non-white\) students were indeed genuinely and rightly offended by it, African-American high school teacher [Tadd Scott](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/01/mission-high-huck-finn-english/) argued that simply glossing the term as the "n-word" when spoken out loud in class was a sufficient remedy that preserved the artistic integrity of Twain's piece.
1.12.11.1. Con: The same author also [acknowledged](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/01/mission-high-huck-finn-english/), however, that this could be construed as a reason simply not to teach Huck Finn at all in a high school context.
1.12.12. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.2.1.1.
1.12.13. Con: Individuals experiencing racism during the19th century is different from someone experiencing racism in the 21st century.
1.12.13.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.1.
1.12.13.2. Pro: A person of color in a Western country no longer lives in a culture where their enslavement is the norm.
1.12.13.3. Con: The N-word is still [invoked](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0ahUKEwjt2Y78xrbVAhUCGz4KHS6hB5AQFghDMAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wbur.org%2Fnews%2F2017%2F06%2F20%2Fthe-n-word-boston&usg=AFQjCNEq_oP2L-gbzg-XTK1-9PL4lH2cRQ) as a term of racial abuse in the 21st century.
1.12.13.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.
1.12.13.4. Con: Racism means prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior. Even if the external circumstances change, the feeling remains the same.
1.12.14. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.12.15. Con: If students are harmed by hip-hop lyrics that they might hear more often then a reading of Huck Finn, that might imply that hip-hop songs need to be rewritten also.
1.12.15.1. Pro: The harm exists via hip-hop music. The term is 'owned' and the history needs explained.
1.12.15.2. Con: Changing words in a culture does not destroy the words... censorship destroys cultures.
1.13. Con: Intentionally removing specific words from a text for political reasons is functionally similar to censorship, which is contrary to the values of liberal democracies and should, therefore, be rejected.
1.13.1. Pro: Censorship of offensive words is incompatible with the norms of liberalism and democracy.
1.13.2. Pro: Censoring books for a "humanitarian cause" will provoke backlash that is counterproductive to that same cause.
1.13.2.1. Pro: Censoring books for a "humanitarian cause" will stimulate reactions against humanitarian ideals, as opponents may push back against the movement that rejected the use of the N-word.
1.13.2.2. Pro: Censoring books for a humanitarian cause may justify censorship from conservative parties for their own political ends.
1.13.2.2.1. Pro: If we allow works to be censored for reasons we agree with, we are still agreeing to censorship. It is a slippery slope that opens the door for future censorship for reasons we might not agree with.
1.13.2.2.1.1. Pro: If censorship is good then, will it be good later... what if the satire from SNL is deemed too offensive or triggered in 20 years?
I don't think it's beyond reasonable that in an education environment that, and other, word\(s\) can be taught to be something that we as a society have come to agree is something that should not be used in the future.
1.13.2.2.1.2. Pro: We cannot rewrite the past and expect a better future. We need to remember the past so that we can forge towards a better future. If we erase it, we will simply end up repeating it. We have to remember that censorship is still censorship and so I ask you: when we start down that road when shall we stop? Look at the past such as the USSR or other totalitarian countries,once you start on this slope there can be no stop to what they can lead to. We should not let our emotions dictate our actions.
1.13.2.2.1.3. Pro: Nations like China, Venezuela and North Korea are criticized for suppressing the freedom of speech of their citizens. If US schools censor content like the N-word in Huckleberry Finn, they risk becoming equally oppressive.
1.13.2.2.1.3.1. Con: The N-Word is already censored on TV. Schools censoring this deeply offensive word wouldn't oppress anyone alive.
1.13.2.3. Pro: There is a danger that censoring insensitive words in Huckleberry Finn might be used to justify censorship that is oppressive towards minorities.
1.13.2.3.1. Pro: If we edit the book because of the use of the n-word, we would need to edit most rap songs and videos for their use of the word.
1.13.2.3.1.1. Con: We do currently censor music and film through classification systems.
1.13.2.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.8.10.10.1.4.1.1.
1.13.2.3.2. Pro: Aside from losing an extremely important teaching moment and setting a precedent that would require the purge of millions of lines of US literature, you will also lose the valuable tool of history to remind us of what should never happen again--to any people. It is a huge disservice to the black community to allow this history to be forgotten. Just as Jews retain the sites and memory of the Holocaust, US history should remain transparent and accurate for its posterity and an enlightened future.
1.13.2.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.15.1.4.1.
1.13.2.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.15.1.4.1.1.
1.13.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.2.2.1.
1.13.4. Con: -> See 1.5.1.
1.13.5. Pro: Removing the N-word would match the [definition of censorship](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/censorship) because the N-word qualifies as political and obscene.
1.13.5.1. Pro: The N-word is considered deeply obscene, fitting with this definition.
1.13.5.1.1. Con: Irrespective of issues of censorship, we tend not to teach obscene works in high schools.
1.13.5.2. Pro: There is [significant debate](http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2013/04/an-african-american-or-a-black-160773) over which terms referring to Black Americans are politically acceptable. Because this type of language is politically-charged, removing the N-word would be a form of political censorship.
1.13.5.2.1. Con: While there may be disagreement about acceptable terms, the racially derogatory epithets used in Huckleberry Finn definitely fall outside of that range.
1.13.5.3. Pro: Literature, like any other art, should be based on its merits and not on political correctness.  If you are going to teach the book, it should however come with an open discussion and education on WHY such words were used in this book.  Education, not exclusion, is a more permanent solution.
1.13.6. Con: Society routinely restricts content deemed inappropriate for children.
1.13.6.1. Pro: Media containing violence, sex and profanity is often restricted to certain age groups.
1.13.6.1.1. Pro: In the music industry the "[Parental Advisory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_Advisory)" warning label has been established to protect children and adolescents from strong language.
1.13.6.1.2. Con: The difference is that this does not censor the music or change its contents, it makes individuals aware that the content is explicit.
1.13.6.1.2.1. Con: Bowdlerized versions of songs are often made available for public streaming. This is quite similar to the proposal of changing racially insensitive language in Huckleberry Finn.
1.13.6.2. Pro: Many [sex education programs](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:wUMQ4aX0I2YJ:www.ode.state.or.us/opportunities/grants/hklb/hivaids/sexedguidelines.pdf+&cd=16&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=de) start with vague details, before moving on to explicit specifics as students get older.
1.13.6.2.1. Con: Sex education often starts with the essentials details of sexuality first before dealing with the broader concepts of gender perceptions and behaviour.
1.13.6.2.2. Pro: Discussions about seemingly uncomfortable topics like anal and oral sex are left to much older students, indicating a culturally-influenced withholding of information.
1.13.6.3. Pro: Similarly contentious works like "The Adventures of Brer Rabbit" have been edited to remove potentially offensive dialect that no longer seems acceptable to modern audiences. The writer's estate publishes both the original text and the modern version, so readers can choose which content they want to consume.
1.13.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.16.3.1.
1.13.6.5. Pro: Publishers have ["self-censored"](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/29/smiling-slaves-the-real-censorship-in-childrens-books) children's books that inaccurately depict the reality of slavery.
1.13.6.6. Con: That society does routinely restrict content deemed inappropriate for children does not mean they should as a matter of course.
1.13.7. Con: -> See 1.5.4.
1.13.8. Pro: The reader of the book should have a choice as to whether to read an edited version or not. Nobody, whether they be the publisher or the government, should impose an edited version on the reader.
1.13.8.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.
1.13.8.2. Pro: The minute you get into policing words, is the minute you're on the wrong side of the debate. Censoring material assumes that your readers are victims and unable to apply critical thinking when they read. It's important to assume that readers need to understand history and apply cultural context to the works they're reading. If they're not at that place, then don't teach it until they are.
1.13.8.2.1. Pro: Even as satire, the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn gives an impression of how Americans truly thought and spoke over a century ago. Through understanding this cultural legacy, American students are more likely to respect all who have struggled to move the US towards greater social equality today.
1.13.9. Pro: Nothing should be censored.
1.13.9.1. Pro: In order to have freedom of speech, one must be willing to be offended.   Literature is the fossil record of our civilization, it is our history of how we got to where we are, our road map.  Censorship is equivalent to taking the warning labels off of poison.
1.13.9.2. Pro: Censorship on any level is wrong, whether we see the object we are censoring as good or bad is irrelevant because history has not changed. We should teach history as it is not as we would like it to be.
1.13.9.3. Pro: Censorship is an inherently oppressive practice.
1.13.9.4. Pro: Instead students should be given context and the strength to deal with things.
1.13.9.4.1. Pro: All will benefit because soon students will be in charge.
1.13.9.5. Pro: Students cannot learn the value of good over bad, beautiful over ugly, without a full range of words. We have language in order to express ourselves. Sanitizing language and over-protecting students makes for weak people unable to think on their feet and/or for themselves. The ability to speak for oneself & preferably on one's feet is essential to a free people. K'sto.
1.13.9.6. Pro: There should be no censorship, regardless of how it is used.  As I tell my students, we have to place everything in the context of its time. We cannot impose our morality on the past, and hopefully future generations will not impose their morality on us and erase any good I do because I wasn't a vegan or something.
1.13.9.7. Con: If nothing were ever censored, images of child abuse and snuff films would be legal and freely available.
1.13.9.7.1. Pro: Illegality is the heaviest form of censorship
1.13.9.7.2. Pro: In these extreme cases the principle of protecting innocent lives is more important than freedom of expression.
1.13.9.8. Pro: Books should not be censored. With language either a word is taboo or it is not. Words should not be taboo dependent on the user's race.
1.13.10. Pro: The removal \(or manipulation\) of information provided to students is a common method of censorship, often used to [cover up uncomfortable truths](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21226068) about the past.
1.13.10.1. Pro: The racial insensitivity was the reality and the book needs to retain its historical setting. Fiction contains historically accurate pictures of our ancestors, the re-writing of history to cleanse human wrongs is extremely dangerous. What may be more effective is using modern works in English class that show the cultural improvements in race relations rather than writing racism out of history.
1.13.10.2. Pro: Historical accuracy means something. People need to have access to the most accurate picture of the past possible. We can not make it the accountability of the state to censor words or historical truth. The individual needs the power and the ability to decipher historical context, and is where the accountability lies.
1.13.10.3. Pro: Censorship would merely be a method in this case to control what a student thinks, rather than how to think. We need critical thinkers to make up their own minds, rather than followers who believe as they are told.
1.13.10.4. Con: -> See 1.5.4.
1.13.10.5. Con: -> See 1.13.6.
1.13.10.6. Con: -> See 1.2.10.4.
1.13.10.7. Pro: Removing racist language in a historical piece of literature could constitute [historical revisionism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism)
1.13.10.7.1. Pro: It is incorrect, and impractical to apply the morals/ethics of modern times on the texts of a previous era. If this would be correct, then we would have to correct all texts written since the beginning of time every few years to account for our updated sensibilities/morals/ethics.
1.13.10.7.2. Pro: The problem with revisionist history is that it pretends to know what is best by today's standards by ignoring and wanting to change how we got to today's standards. 

The biggest problem is that a book that helped the abolisionist movement by humanizing black slaves is no considered racist because of the contemporary word use. By revising history, you are removing context and eventually, we will revert into a word where meaning of certain aspects is lost. This will hurt us all in the end
1.13.10.8. Pro: Eliminating every nuance of the past in the attempt to protect the children is not only misguided but unwarranted as children go to school to be educated and prepared for the world, not coddled into ignorance. Giving credibility to the idea that history is offensive by removing content creates young adults who are ignorant and will likely recreate the mistakes of history.
1.13.10.9. Pro: Huckleberry Finn is historical fiction. Racism was the norm at the time it takes place. To ignore that horrific word is akin to placing one's head in the sand. This is particularly true since even schools reading literature does not endorse the characters. I've read books in school about thieves, war, and murder yet no one thinks a school endorses any of that.
