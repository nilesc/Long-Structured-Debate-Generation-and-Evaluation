Discussion Title: Should Gambling be Banned in Europe?

1. Gambling should be prohibited in Europe.
1.1. Con: European societies base themselves on liberal democracy. Thus, everybody, be it majority or minority, has the maximum freedom as long as it does not hurt others. Because gambling does not affect a third party it should not be prohibited.
1.1.1. Con: There are many laws that prohibit certain activities where no third party is harmed such as drug use, incest, polygamy or eating human flesh.
1.1.1.1. Con: Generally, such laws are intended to keep society functional and prevent harming third parties, even if the forbidden action itself does not directly harm anyone.
1.1.1.2. Con: Taboos on patricide, cannibalism, murder and incest are the legal grounds for most of those provisions.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Those taboos are applicable to nearly all of mankind and therewith form something close to natural law.
1.1.2. Con: Gambling can destroy [families](https://aifs.gov.au/agrc/publications/impact-gambling-problems-families/what-are-impacts-gambling-problems-families).
1.1.2.1. Pro: Problem gambling comes along with lies and secrets to the family.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Problem gambling comes along with loosing money and therefore being unable to pay for the livelihood anymore.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Problem gamblers have no time left for family activities.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: Workaholics have no time left for familiy activities either. It does not necessarily destroy families.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: Not all gamblers are problem gamblers.
1.1.2.3.3. Con: You can put the word "problem" in front of almost anything... that does not mean the thing should be banned. Problem charities, problem doctors, problem taxpayers, etc.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Children of problem gamblers are at greater risk of becoming problem gamblers themselves.
1.1.2.5. Con: Many activities can destroy families, but banning them is not a sensible solution.
1.1.2.5.1. Pro: Cheating can destroy families, but is not banned.
1.1.2.5.2. Pro: Alcoholism can destroy families, but drinking alcohol is not banned.
1.2. Pro: Most of the time people do not win, but rather lose money.
1.2.1. Con: Someone will win though. So this is even.
1.2.1.1. Con: It does not matter whether someone wins a couple of times, but who wins on average. And that are of course the gambling providers.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The math behind gambling is solid and is designed to favor the gambling businesses.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Roulette, the game with the highest payout ratio, is 35/36. This leaves still enough profits for the Casino.
1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: This is not exclusive to gambling. The math behind any profit-making enterprise is designed to favour that enterprise.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: On average, the gambling providers, run by businessmen, make profits, otherwise all of them would shut down, as it would not make any sense to run them.
1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.
1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.
1.2.4. Con: Losing money is not reason enough to ban an activity. Otherwise things such as financial speculation or stock purchases must be banned as well, as the risks of losing money are pretty high as well.
1.3. Pro: Drugs are equally self-destructive and are banned. Judging by the same standards gambling should be prohibited.
1.3.1. Con: Gambling is not necessarily self-destructive. Many people only gamble once in a while as means of social amusement.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Only very few people get addicted to gambling.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: A German study showed that under 1% of German gamblers are problem gamblers. \([vdai.de](http://www.vdai.de/spielverhalten/BZgA-2014.pdf)\)
1.3.1.2. Con: That's the same with drugs: many people use them only once. So they should be treat equally.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: The difference with drugs is that while gambling as a act in itself does no harm, its harm only related to addiction, a great number of drugs can be damaging even with one time use for example; [overdose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_overdose) and risks related to quality and dosage of [MDMA](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/297064.php).
1.3.2. Con: Drugs have a direct impact on peoples' physical and mental health whereas gambling only affects the latter in terms that it may be addictive in some cases.
1.3.3. Con: Alcohol and cigarettes can be self-destructing as well, but are not banned in Europe.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Cigarettes are addictive and unhealthy, but smoking is not prohibited.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Nicotine is highly addictive. \([betobaccofree.hhs.gov](http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov/health-effects/nicotine-health/)\)

1.3.3.1.4. Con: As cigarette smoke is considered unhealthy as well \(passive smoking\), you cannot smoke everywhere you like.
1.3.3.1.5. Con: Perhaps it should be.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Alcohol is unhealthy and overconsumation can lead to addiction, but it is not prohibited.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Drinking alcohol can [damage](https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/alcohol-facts/health-effects-of-alcohol/effects-on-the-body/alcohol-and-liver-disease/) the liver.

1.3.3.2.2.1. Con: Healthy or not, you should not reason consuming mind altering products by it's heath related facts or alegations. You consume it because you like it does for you.
1.3.3.2.3. Con: Alcohol [relieves](http://www.healthline.com/health/alcohol-and-anxiety) stress.
1.3.3.3. Con: Alcohol is not what causes the dependence but rather the overuse of it.
1.3.3.4. Con: Prohibition is not a solution to mitigate the self-destructive effects of alcohol and cigarettes.
1.3.4. Con: Cannabis is not forbidden in some European countries, such as the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_the_Netherlands), even though it is considered a harmful drug.
1.3.4.1. Con: Cannabis comes with [health benefits](http://www.businessinsider.de/health-benefits-of-medical-marijuana-2014-4?r=US&IR=T).
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Even in Germany there is an increasing tendency to regulate cannabis in medical treatment. \([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alu5s5QxDb0)\)
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: The smoking of cannabis with tobacco is unhealthy because of the tobacco; not because of the cannabis.
1.3.4.1.2.1. Con: Burning organic materials, no matter if it's tobacco or cannabis, releases "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons" which raises the risk for cancer. [sciencedirect.com](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/027323009290009X)
1.3.4.1.2.2. Con: Cannabis users have an increased risk of [mental health problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25777798) that do not correlate with tobacco use, including psychoses, cognitive impairment, and lower educational attainment.
1.3.4.1.3. Con: Using cannabis impairs driving ability, increasing the likelihood of car crash and fatality.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Consuming cannabis on a regular basis can reduce the IQ of a person, because it is bad for the brain. \([focus.de](http://www.focus.de/gesundheit/ratgeber/psychologie/sucht/tid-27074/sieben-fakten-zu-cannabis-wann-der-joint-gefaehrlich-wird_aid_807975.html)\)
1.3.4.2.1. Con: Cannabis use [does not](http://www.iflscience.com/brain/cannabis-use-doesn-t-lower-adolescents-iq-new-studies-show/) lower adolescents’ IQ.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: [Research](https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2016/jan/14/does-cannabis-really-lower-your-iq) has shown that differences other than cannabis use might be causing the much-discussed disparities in cognitive function.
1.3.5. Pro: Gambling is already [prohibited](http://www.gamblingsites.org/laws/) in some countries or in some forms around the world because of its destructive effects.
1.3.5.1. Con: But gambling still takes place in those countries illegally, so the problem is not solved.
1.3.6. Con: The majority of gamblers are [not addicts](https://source.wustl.edu/2005/12/washington-university-researchers-assessing-rates-and-risks-of-gambling/)
1.3.6.1. Pro: [Casual gamblers](https://www.healthyplace.com/addictions/gambling-addiction/types-of-gamblers-compulsive-gamblers-and-more/) do play for recreation.
1.3.6.2. Pro: [80%](https://source.wustl.edu/2005/12/washington-university-researchers-assessing-rates-and-risks-of-gambling/) of the population gambles occasionally. It is unlikely that all of them are addicts.
1.3.7. Con: Judging by the same standards, drugs should be legalised - allow people to determine what is destructive to themselves.
1.3.8. Con: There are many recreational drug users doing no harm to anyone
1.3.9. Con: Banning drugs created number of issues, main being drugs distribution related criminal activity. Ban did not allow to control or restrict drugs' supply. Ban on gambling will have the same effect.
1.4. Pro: Gambling causes problems for the individual.
1.4.1. Pro: Gambling can be addictive.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Governments should protect their citizens against addictions.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Governments should help addicts to become "clean" but protecting citizens against any kind of addiction would mean to cut individual freedom.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Alcohol and cigarettes would have to be forbidden.
1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: The government should assume that every citizen at a certain age is able to decide independently about taking or doing stuff that might end in an addiction.
1.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.4.1.3. Pro: There are about [6000 000](http://www.daserste.de/information/politik-weltgeschehen/weltspiegel/sendung/ndr/suedkorea-118.html) gambling addicts in South Korea.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: In South Korea gambling is prohibited but in one casino. Thus the negative effects can be attributed to prohibiting it rather than allowing it.
1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: After one person used a bar of soap there might be hair sticking to it.
1.4.1.3.2. Con: Casinos are actually [good](http://www.nzz.ch/international/die-goldgrube-auf-der-abraeumhalde-1.18377355) for Korea as they create jobs, lead to more tourism and pay a lot of taxes.

1.4.2.1.3. Pro: Problem gamblers are more and more isolated from their socio-environment. This kind of loneliness can lead to suicide attempts.

1.4.2.3.1. Con: It is possible to buy proper food without much money. \([books.google.co.kr](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=XkFMayG3h2EC&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=trotz+schulden+gut+essen&source=bl&ots=u0cuzaSbG7&sig=t0Sji4cSeRm14lRlAIn5vAtw7Yg&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj0ianS6aPJAhUDkpQKHf1ODGAQ6AEIMDAE#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.4.2.4. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.4.2.5. Pro: "Problem gamblers are more likely to suffer from low self-esteem, stress, anxiety and depression." \([nhs.uk](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/addiction/Pages/gamblingaddiction.aspx)\)
1.4.2.5.1. Pro: Problem gamblers are isolated from their socioenvironment.
1.4.2.5.2. Pro: Problem gamblers have increasingly high debts.
1.4.2.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.4.2.5.3. Pro: Problem gamblers feel [ashamed](http://www.psychforums.com/gambling-addiction/topic102821.html) of their addiction.
1.4.2.5.4. Pro: Some female problem gamblers feel forced to [prostitute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUsX9UMxJnQ) themselves to make money for gambling.
1.4.2.6. Pro: Problem gamblers often have problems with alcoholism as well. \([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1495100/)\)
1.4.3. Pro: Gambling can lead the player into financial ruin.
1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.5.2.
1.4.4. Con: Anything not enjoyed in moderation can cause problems but that doesn't mean it should not be permitted
1.4.5. Con: The problem is not in gambling itself but in how the individual deals with this. [A minority of individuals who engage in gambling develop problems with it](https://rehab-international.org/gambling-addiction/gambling-addiction-statistics). So the origin of the problem lies in the individual and that's where we should focus our efforts to remedy it.
1.4.6. Con: Gambling can be beneficial to some individuals.
1.4.6.1. Pro: The casino owners are also individuals whom are participating in gambling during their daily operations. These people benefit from gambling.

1.5.2. Pro: Europe profits from taxes paid by gambling companies.
1.5.2.1. Con: Taxes are not levied on wins of gamblers. These turnovers are thus not included in the tax declaration of the company or the individual. Thus a transfer of money took place without tax deduction. If gambling would be prohibited these funds would have been used for tax creating purposes. Thus the overall tax income got reduced.
1.5.3. Pro: Gambling creates jobs.
1.5.3.1. Pro: There is a whole business branch living on gambling, e.g. manufacturers of gambling machines, programmers, bookmakers, sports anlysts etc.

1.5.4. Con: Gambling is sometimes connected to criminal activities.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Gambling may be connected to money laundering, corruption, theft and fraud. \([bwl.uni-hamburg.de](https://www.bwl.uni-hamburg.de/irdw/dokumente/publikationen/das-deutsche-gluecksspielwesen-kriminogene-aspekte-und-zahlungsstroeme-2013.pdf)\)
1.5.4.2. Pro: Problem gamblers are often desperately in need for money which may lead to [criminal activities](http://www2.gsu.edu/~psyjge/Fact/PG_%20Crime_04_10.pdf) like robbery, theft and fraud.
1.5.4.3. Pro: Illegal gambling is already a major problem around the world. \([havocscope.com](http://www.havocscope.com/illegal-gambling/)\)
1.5.4.4. Con: Most gamblers do not engage in criminal activities
1.5.4.4.1. Con: A [study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=233792) done in the USA found that counties crime rate did increase after casinos were built in/around them.
1.5.4.5. Pro: Sports bettings can lead to manipulation of football matches.

1.5.4.5.2. Con: Betting does not count as gambling.
1.5.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.4.1.
1.5.4.7. Pro: There is a substantial proportion of underreported crimes that happens inside the families \(i.e. theft of money or jewels\) so that the relatives won't press charges
1.5.5. Con: Gambling affects poor segments of society more than the rich. This widens the gap between rich and poor. \([politifact.com](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/nov/18/john-stemberger/largest-numbers-gamblers-come-poor/)\)
1.5.6. Con: The fact itself, that gambling brings money to the state, does not excuse such money. Drug trafficking also brings money to drug traffickers, but society does not consider it as OK.
1.5.6.1. Con: Many countries legalized drugs and make profit from taxing it.
1.5.7. Con: The state suffers the costs of rehabilitation of pathological gamblers and theyr families
1.5.8. Con: Most of the costs of the gambling is partly hidden by debt with lonesharks and erosion of family savings and properties
1.6. Con: It is within an individual's rights to choose whether or not to gamble.
1.6.1. Pro: Gambling is fun.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Most people like betting with friends \(e.g. on the outcome of sports events\).
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Betting with friends is not the same as gambling, because it usually does not involve the risk of high monetary losses.
1.6.1.1.2. Pro: Betting on horse races or game results is equal to gamble in a casino.
1.6.1.2. Con: It is not fun for the families and friends of gambling addicts.
1.6.1.3. Con: Gambling is not fun. It puts people under emotional and psychological stress.
1.6.1.4. Pro: Gambling is a classical thing to do on a [bachelor party](http://www.forbes.com/2007/06/19/travel-party-bachelor-forbeslife-cx_sv_0620travel.html).

1.6.2. Pro: Gambling is a way to make a lot of money for the individual.
1.6.2.1. Pro: There are professional gamblers. \([tynan.com](http://tynan.com/how-i-became-a-professional-gambler)\)

1.6.3. Pro: It is someone's choice to gamble, and choices should not be taken away from someone.
1.6.4. Con: Consequences of gambling are not individual anymore, however. Consequences of gambling affect family and greater society as well.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Gambling causes problems for society.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Gambling siphons money from other industries that would be beneficial to the economy as a whole.
1.6.4.1.1.1. Pro: Money lost in gambling cannot be invested in new machinery and thus will prevent efficiency gains.
1.6.4.1.1.2. Con: The money stays in the economy but will be used for other purposes, e.g. luxury goods.
1.6.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Luxury goods are not beneficial for the economy as they are not selected for their rational benefit but for conspicuous consumption.
1.6.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Luxury goods are beneficial for the economy because people earn money with it.
1.6.4.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: European producers are the global leader in making luxury goods, e.g. Chanel.
1.6.4.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: The money would be better challenged to more efficient sectors enhancing overall productivity of society rather than individual pleasure.
1.6.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.6.4.1.2. Pro: Problem gambling burdens social security systems.
1.6.4.1.2.1. Pro: Therapies are expensive.
1.6.4.1.2.2. Pro: Many problem gamblers [lose](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1495100/) their jobs.
1.6.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.
1.6.4.1.4. Con: If gambling would be forbidden in Europe, it would strenghten the black market for gambling.
1.6.4.1.4.1. Pro: Given the size of the gambling market in Europe if not even all but just half of them leave legality there is a substantial problem.
1.6.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: In recent years entertainment tax on slot machines skyrocketed in Germany. \([de.wikipedia.org](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vergn%C3%BCgungsteuer_\(Deutschland\)#/media/File:Vergn%C3%BCgungsteuer_Deutschland.svg)\)
1.6.4.1.4.1.2. Pro: All the casinos combined in the European Casino Association’s 23 member countries generated consolidated gaming revenues of €6.58bn in 2012. \([europeancasinoassociation.org](http://www.europeancasinoassociation.org/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/ECA_European_Casino_Industry_Report_2013-web.pdf)\)
1.6.4.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.
1.6.4.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.
1.6.4.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.
1.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.7. Con: Gamblers would avoid the ban by traveling to remote gambling safe havens like Macau or Las Vegas.
1.7.1. Con: This would sort out many addicted players because they simply cannot afford to go abroad and thus reduce societal costs.
1.7.2. Con: This would export problems associated with gambling to other destinations outside Europe and thus be beneficial for Europe.
1.7.3. Pro: Reaching gambling destinations is not particularly expensive by plane. This makes it more likely that people avoid the ban.
1.8. Con: If gambling were forbidden, problem gamblers would be forced to gamble illegally instead of in a regulated gambling industry. This would come with negative consequences for those addicts.
1.8.1. Pro: Addiction can be an extremely hard thing to fight. Gamblers would find a way even if it was made illegal.
1.8.2. Pro: If prohibited, it would incentivise the growth [of unsafe online casino sites](https://www.casinosmash.com/rogue-casinos.htm) where gamblers would play with no guarantee of safe play and no control by the national authorities. Rather than a prohibition per se, we should look at strengthening the control of local authorities over the activities of European gamblers online.
1.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.10. Con: As it is for other kind of addictions, prohibition doesn't solve the problem. A solution could be reinvesting the money earned by the state in campaigns against compulsive gambling.
1.10.1. Pro: It's not possible to make all problems disappear by just forbidding  them. Social problems usually are much more complex than that.
1.11. Con: Some people earn a living from professional gambling. A ban would mean unemployment for those who do and affect their families financially.
1.11.1. Con: It is possible to distinguish professional from patological gambler based on goals \(pros gamble to win, patological gamble to keep playing\) amount of ability involved to determine the outcome\(i.e.  poker vs vlts\) being able to learn from the negative feedback
1.11.2. Con: Professional gambling is not economically productive. Professional gamblers only gain income at the expense of casino owners or other gamblers.
1.12. Con: You cannot effectively ban internet gambling
1.12.1. Con: Some sites would remain, but many others could be effectively banned or blocked.
1.13. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.1.
1.14. Con: A prohibition of gambling would not have a significant enough effect on the actual prevalence of gambling among members of society for the costs associated with trying to enforce a ban to outweigh the limited possible benefits.
1.15. Con: A more effective solution would be to put a cap on the money an individual can spend in gambling, e.g. 5% of his/her income.
1.15.1. Con: To implement this regulation would require very difficult and costly changes to current infrastructure.
1.15.2. Con: It would be a lack of privacy if everyone has to reveal how much he/she earns in order to gamble
1.16. Pro: The energy spent from society on gambling can be spent on better purposes.
