1.3. Pro: The idea of a "secret rapture" was a foreign idea to the original audience of the 1 Thessalonians 4 passage supporting the claim.
1.4. Pro: The rapture promotes the idea of escapism, rather than engagement with the culture.
1.5. Con: Matthew 24 teaches that one will be left and the other taken.
1.6. Con: If there is no rapture, the Church must suffer during the Great Tribulation.
