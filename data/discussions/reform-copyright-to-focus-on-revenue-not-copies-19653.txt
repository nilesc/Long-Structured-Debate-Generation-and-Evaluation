Discussion Title: Reform copyright to focus on revenue, not copies

1. Reform copyright to focus on revenue, not copies
1.1. Con: This would eliminate the vast majority of revenue from any creative work other than live performances because everyone would just share everything for free online and copyright owners could not stop them
1.1.1. Con: Direct revenue from copies would take a hit - but they already do. Any money that is made on a work per default belongs to the creator unless otherwise agreed. If money cannot be made, sadly then your ideas are not commercially viable.
1.2. Con: Copyright should be abolished entirely, not reformed.
1.2.1. Con: Abolishment in it's entirety would allow anyone to use the works in a manner that may actively hurt the creator. For instance, let's say a Neo-Fascistic party would take your parodic anti-fascist song as their new party jingle, would you be o.k. with that?
1.2.1.1. Con: Yes, because substitution effects make this a small harm.
1.2.1.2. Con: Yes, because the reverse - appropriating the party anthem of a rising neofascist movement for an anti-fascist parody - is equally valid and it evens out.
1.2.1.3. Con: It wouldn't matter if I was or not, because you can't own an idea, and that remains true even if claiming to own an idea in a particular instance can prevent harm.
1.3. Pro: By focusing on revenue, you place all power with the creator, thus protecting the creator - not the company.
1.4. Con: Copyright is fine as it is, there is no need to change it.
1.4.1. Con: Copyright harms artists while enriching companies' owners. It must be changed for the sake of equality.
1.5. Con: The "big companies" contribute a whole lot more than you think, and therefore it's good that the laws protect them.
1.6. Pro: The current copyright system is incompatible with a free and open Internet.
1.7. Con: Changing the rules like this will hurt a lot of people dependant on those rules.
1.8. Con: Free licenses such as GPL and Creative Commons rely on current copyright rules, removing these would also invalidate those licenses.
1.9. Pro: By not focusing on copies, sharing files for personal, non-profit use would be a whole lot easier.
1.10. Pro: By switching to a revenue-based model, services become far more important than any single copy.
