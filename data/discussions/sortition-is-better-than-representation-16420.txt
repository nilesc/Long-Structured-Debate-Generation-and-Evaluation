1. Sortition is Better than Representation
1.1. Con: Sortition may result in professional bureaucrats having too much power.

1.3.1. Pro: The whole point of public policy and governance is acute acumen in a particular domain to direct society in some progressive direction.

This can result in unstable polity/government in that society.

1.8.2. Con: Representation doesn't pull people out of their careers & force them into office.
