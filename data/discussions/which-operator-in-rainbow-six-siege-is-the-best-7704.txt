Discussion Title: Which Operator In Rainbow Six Siege is The Best?

1. Which Operator In Rainbow Six Siege is The Best?
1.1. Ash \(Attack\)
1.1.1. Pro: 3 speed operators have an advantage over all other types of operators as they can rush easily. Ash's guns are built around this and she can take full advantage of her speed over her enemies.
1.1.2. Pro: Her assault rifle has high accuracy, high damage, and a large clip size, making it one of the best guns in the game.
1.1.3. Con: Her ability is clunky, slow, and has little to no combat use, meaning she offers little in unique gameplay and changes little.
1.2. Montagne \(Attack\)
1.3. Rook \(Defense\)
1.4. Doc \(Defense\)
1.5. IQ \(Attack\)
1.6. Blitz \(Attack\)
1.7. Jaeger \(Defense\)
1.8. Bandit \(Defense\)
1.9. Fuze \(Attack\)
1.9.1. Con: Using Fuze effectively requires to gather intelligence using drones and communication with others.
1.9.2. Con: Just firing Cluster Charges might kill hostages.

1.12. Thermite \(Attack
1.13. Kapkan \(Defense\)
1.14. Buck \(Attack\)
1.15. Frost \(Defense\)
1.16. Blackbeard \(Attack\)
1.17. Valkyrie \(Defense\)
1.18. Capitao \(Attack\)
1.19. Caveira \(Defense\)
1.19.1. Pro: Interrogating an enemy reveals their position to your entire team, which can lead to multiple easy kills and lead to a victory all on it's own.
1.19.2. Con: Against a highly organized team Cav can be denied her strongest tools and be taken out easily. Because of this she sees less play in competitive and in tournaments.
1.20. Hibana \(Attack\)
1.21. Echo \(Defense\)
1.22. Jackal \(Attack\)
1.23. Pulse \(Defense\)
1.24. Mira \(Defense\)
1.25. Ying \(Attack\)
1.25.1. Con: Flashbangs don't always activate on enemies if they're looking away correctly. This makes it possible to get nothing out of her Candelas.
1.25.2. Con: Unlike Fuze, there is little use in using a Candela from outside a wall or on another floor into an area, as your teammates are blinded as well and Ying will be too far away to do anything before the effect wears off.
1.25.3. Pro: Her immunity to flashbangs means she can be played aggressively much better than other fraggers.
1.26. Lesion \(Defense\)
1.27. Zofia \(Attack\)
1.28. Ela \(Defense\)
1.29. Dokkaebi \(Attack\)
