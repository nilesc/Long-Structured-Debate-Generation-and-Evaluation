Discussion Title: Should the use of 'chosen' or gender-neutral pronouns be mandatory?

1. The use of ‘chosen' or gender-neutral pronouns should be mandatory.
1.1. Con: Mandatory pronouns go against the concept of freedom of speech.
1.1.1. Con: [Freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech) is the capacity of citizens in democratic societies to express their ideas without being censored or sanctioned by the government. How a private citizen wants to be referred to \(including name, status or pronoun\) is not regulated by public institutions.
1.1.1.1. Con: If the law mandates that people have the right to determine how others refer to them, then the government is forcing an implicit set of beliefs on the population. The free flow of ideas will be stifled.
1.1.1.2. Con: How a private citizen wants to be referred to is not regulated by public institutions, therefore, the regulation of pronoun usage is not covered by any restriction, nor any freedom.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: How private citizens interact with each other is indeed regulated. One cannot make false statements about someone else, for example.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Freedom of speech is not absolute. Between private citizens one can offend another and face repercussions in the form of libel, [defamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation) or calumny.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Actually, one can make false statements about someone else. They are free to make those statements, but not free from the consequences of those statements if they are found to cause harm to another party. That's a matter for the court to decide. 

In any case, the legal basis here is the legislation of harm to another party, not the legislation of language itself.
1.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: In a similar manner, one can choose to misgender someone repeatedly  and use incorrect pronouns. If laws are in place to regulate that, the person misgendered can sue and go to courts for a judge to decide if an offense has been committed.
1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: If the use of incorrect pronouns is akin to harassment, existing laws can be used to remedy the situation. Harassment is a concept, not an agreed-upon list of acceptable and unacceptable words.
1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Having the law accepting that "constant misgendering is harassment" is different than what we have today, in which you'd have to prove that. There are numerous reasons to do this, from raising awareness of this problematic to help people who suffer from this
1.1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: As with any laws, obviously they do prohibit something in the sense that they apply punishment and consequences. One is also 'free' to murder someone, but will have to face legal repercussions if found guilty.
1.1.1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Laws against murder deal with the consequence \(death\), not the action. Shooting a gun is legal, but shooting another person with a gun is murder. It's the outcome of the action, not the action itself, that is adjudicated. Legislating grammar is like outlawing the shooting of a gun because it MIGHT lead to murder. Actions are not legislated: outcomes are.
1.1.1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Actions are legislated, if you drive drunk you MIGHT lead to an accident, and we punish the action exactly because of that. There are numerous examples, not only this one, of actions without victims \(and without problematic outcomes\) being legislated
1.1.1.2.1.3. Con: How an individual identifies and therefore chooses to be addressed is not an objectively verifiable truth; rather, it is a personal preference. Thus, there are no false statements when it comes to "chosen" pronouns.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: The legal system itself is an institution of government. Therefore, inclusion of such laws on the books would be a violation of the first amendment on that grounds.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: For example, there is no law in place to punish you should you decide not to call your physician "Doctor."
1.1.1.3. Con: A law which sanctions somebody for failing to use a particular word is, by definition, compelled speech, which is the exact opposite of free speech.
1.1.2. Pro: Enforceable pronouns violate freedom of speech principles. Although people who purposely misgender trans people may be jerks, that speech is protected, and should be.
1.1.2.1. Con: That would depend on the legislation. If constantly and intentionally misgendering someone is considered an offense \(as hate speech is\) that would be a limit to freedom of speech.
1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.1.3. Con: A name is a form of speech, so is a pronoun, if some wants to have a different name or pronoun, they are protected by the [First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution).
1.1.3.1. Con: As is the person who says "yes ma'am" to a person who identifies as a man.
1.1.3.2. Con: First amendment protections apply to your own speech, not that of others. If other people do not wish to honor your decided change, that is in turn protected by their first amendment rights- not negated by yours.
1.1.3.3. Con: The "first amendment" is not relevant to anyone outside of the USA.
1.1.4. Con: Aside from whether it should be legally required, one important issue is whether it is morally acceptable to refuse to use someone's stated pronouns.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The simple answer: it is not acceptable.  Just as it is unacceptable to refer to an overweight person as "Fatty" or someone who is autistic as "Rainman".  It is behavior that should be stopped by society, not law.
1.1.4.2. Con: We should not modify basic biology just because it threatens someone's subjective view of who they are.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: Respecting and using the pronouns someone indicates does not modify anyone's biology or biology in general as a concept.
1.1.5. Pro: Standardizing language reduces choice; it stultifies the freedom and complexity of unfettered thought in favour of ideological conformity. See "[Newspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak)" from 1984 for an example of this.
1.1.5.1. Con: Respecting with which pronoun someone wants to be referred to \(using already existing pronouns or some new ones\) has nothing to do with "a controlled [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak), of restricted grammar and limited vocabulary, meant to limit the freedom of thought".
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: It is not about limiting speech but the opposite: making already existing language more inclusive so everyone can feel [valued](https://uwm.edu/lgbtrc/qa_faqs/why-is-it-important-to-respect-peoples-pronouns/) and represented.
1.1.6. Con: As the acceptance and wellbeing of minorities outweight free speech, exceptions to upholding it should be made.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Murder is a bigger problem than freedom of speech: it is illegal to use speech to cause murder [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing)
1.1.7. Pro: In a free society, nothing should be mandatory. Rights are those things that are yours by solely being human. Self expression is one of them
1.1.7.1. Con: A free society also needs to balance the rights of one person and the rights of another. It may be very unfair that to respect someone’s self-expression rights \(calling someone else the pronoun that they want\), they are able to trump someone else’s rights \(being addressed in a preferred and respectful way\).
1.1.8. Pro: Language is the tool we use to convey our sense of reality. Someone should not be forced to express a reality they do not perceive \(e.g. a man being a woman, or a woman not having a gender\).
1.1.9. Pro: Regulating language may be one of the first mechanisms to cement a particular ideology on a constitutional level. Once it becomes an effective law, there are no grounds for defending freedom of speech.
1.1.10. Con: A pronoun cannot prevent from expressing an idea.
1.1.10.1. Con: Freedom of speech is not just "expressing an idea." Rather, it grants the ability to do do so without the risk of retaliation, censorship, or sanction. Thus, by definition, mandating chosen pronouns by law breaks the very foundation of the concept of freedom of speech.
1.1.11. Con: The concept of freedom of speech is not inherently desirable. As this [source \(4.2 Democratic Citizenship and Hate Speech\)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/#DemCitHatSpe) points out, "We have to decide whether it is better to place a higher value on speech than on the value of privacy, security, equality, or the prevention of harm."
1.1.11.1. Con: Those decisions have already been made \(e.g. in America, one can not incite harm and hide behind the freedom of speech protection\).
1.1.11.1.1. Con: There is [not enough consensus](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/20/40-of-millennials-ok-with-limiting-speech-offensive-to-minorities/) about freedom of speech or [what should be banned](https://www.cato.org/blog/poll-71-americans-say-political-correctness-has-silenced-discussions-society-needs-have-58-have), so this decisions are worth to debate
1.1.12. Con: Freedom of speech is about what may be said, not how to say it. Pronouns are about how to address a person and thus do not touch the freedom of speech.
1.1.13. Pro: Without a biological basis established, gender is a subjective belief, and enforcing personal subjective beliefs is not the role of a representative government that protects freedom of thought, expression, and religion.
1.1.14. Pro: Just as one seeks to be identified using certain terminology, that he chooses to identify as, so to another can also seek to use terminology that one chooses to identify others as. If I call myself 'Y' and you call me 'Y' cannot I call you 'Z'? Conformity is subjective not mandatory.
1.2. Pro: Using chosen pronouns make people feel comfortable and accepted.
1.2.1. Pro: People with discriminatory beliefs about the trans community may use misgendering as a tactic for harassment and bullying.
1.2.1.1. Pro: A 2015 [US Trans Survey](https://www.healthline.com/health/transgender/misgendering#why-it-happens), found that 46% of respondents experienced verbal harassment because of their identity and 9% had been physically assaulted.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: The study asks trans individuals to use their own definition of harassment and their own perception of discrimination, therefore we do not have a standardised meaning of these words within the study, and thus, it is more difficult to draw concrete conclusions from the data obtained.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Even without standardized data, the fact that 46% of trans respondents feel harassed and discriminated show a social pattern that is worrisome.
1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: In 2017, the number of trans people killed was 28, including crimes involving "clear anti-transgender bias".
1.2.1.2. Con: The concepts of harassment and bullying are already covered elsewhere in the law. When pronoun usage is being intentionally used to harass or bully, legal action can already be taken under existing statutes. Thus, there is no need to further legislate the specific use of pronouns.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: While calling a biological man "he" will not be considered harassment by pronoun usage under current legislation, a biological man who identifies as whatever else might still feel harassed.
1.2.2. Con: The purpose of the law is to establish a general order for society, not to ensure everyone's emotional comfort.
1.2.2.1. Con: Laws in many countries regulate [speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech) that consider harmful \(hate speech\), even if not physically but psychologically. Therefore, emotional comfort can indeed be regulated.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: If emotional comfort can be regulated, then the people in power are able to regulate their emotional comfort in the form of labeling speech that they disagree with as psychologically harmful to the children, thus making opinions they don't want to hear illegal.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Emotional comfort [is already regulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress) in some cases, and we don't have any person in power regulating their own. This can be explained because laws usually attend to rational reasons to protect people from each other, and we have a certain need to protect people from being misgendered because [it relates to gender dysphoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphoria) and it has some dangerous effects
1.2.2.1.2. Con: Discomfort is not equivalent to harm.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: We have some proof that misgendering is very harmful, not only because of all the testimonies of people receiving it, but [also because it probably has a relation to depressive symptoms](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X\(18\)30085-5/abstract), which is explained by [dysphoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphoria)
1.2.2.2. Con: This law's desired outcome is to increase communication within a society more antisocial and deprived of personal interaction.
1.2.3. Con: Pronoun choice is a matter of manners, and does not rise to the level of needed legal protection. It's the equivalent of establishing a law that states you can't talk while chewing. It may be rude and impolite, but those matters are separate from law.
1.2.3.1. Con: Protecting an already marginalized community by making people use the right pronouns for everyone, and thus making them feel accepted and valued, is not just a question of manners and is not akin to talking while chewing.
1.2.4. Con: Feeling comfortable is less important than freedom of speech.
1.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.2.4.2. Con: Discomfort may suppress freedom of speech. It can make someone prefer to stay silent rather than express their opinion and get exposed to harassment.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: Lots of things can make someone prefer to stay silent. They are not going against freedom of speech because of this. For example, timid people might prefer to stay silent around loud people, but it doesn't mean that a law should prevent you from being loud.
1.2.4.3. Con: Calling somebody names or not addressing them by their chosen pronoun is a matter of form, but not content. Only content is protected by the right to freedom of speech.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: The form is also part of the content
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: Pronouns can be considered form because using the correct one\(s\) is simply one way of communicating the underlying message of accepting and recognizing the other person's gender identity.
1.2.4.3.3. Con: Generally, words are literally content \(as a part of speech\). Ergo, they are not simply form.
1.2.5. Con: It could just as well make others feel uncomfortable, as well as creating immense social stress because the number of words required to just talk to a person increases dramatically.
1.2.5.1. Con: There is no evidence to suggest a connection between social stress and the number of words required to talk.
1.2.5.2. Con: The level of discomfort in using a new pronoun is not comparable to the level of discomfort, discrimination, harassment and violence that trans individuals face just by their mere identity.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.5.2.2. Pro: [Research](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/26/crucial-study-transgender-children-mental-health-family-support) indicates that children allowed to express their identity and whose families support their transition "have good mental health."
1.2.5.2.2.1. Con: How one is supported within the small familial nucleus is different from how one is treated by society at large. Family members have different feelings, incentives, and motivations than strangers.
1.2.5.2.3. Pro: The [suicide](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/trans-young-people-suicide-support-mental-health) rate among transgender people is much [higher](http://www.teni.ie/page.aspx?contentid=673) than in other groups. Gender-based discrimination, victimization, bullying, and rejection from friends, family or the community, all [play a role](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-truth-about-exercise-addiction/201612/why-transgender-people-experience-more-mental-health) in these suicides.
1.2.5.2.3.1. Pro: As we can never know how close to the suicide tipping point a trans person may be, using their preferred pronouns could save a life.
1.2.5.2.3.2. Pro: About [40%](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-truth-about-exercise-addiction/201612/why-transgender-people-experience-more-mental-health) to [45%](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/trans-young-people-suicide-support-mental-health) of trans people have attempted suicide.
1.2.5.2.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.2.2.
1.2.5.2.3.4. Con: Enforcing the use of preferred pronouns is likely to create a social backfire effect, in which trans people become even more socially excluded because others are uncertain, uncomfortable, or outright resentful of having their speech compelled by law. Thereby increasing the social isolation that increases suicide risk.
1.2.5.2.3.5. Con: There is a difference between pronoun usage and harassment. There are currently no specific language requirements for harassment; such laws speak only to intent. Thus, while it's not necessary to legislate pronoun usage, the argument could be made under current law that repeated use of an incorrect pronoun for purposes of harassment is illegal.
1.2.5.2.3.5.1. Con: However, if no laws make any specific mentions of the use of pronouns, it can be even more difficult to prove and quite open to interpretation.
1.2.5.2.3.5.1.1. Pro: In the same way that "some forms of verbal [harassment](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/when-free-speech-turns-in_b_14632644.html) are unique to traditionally oppressed groups", for example, racial or religious slurs or sexist remarks, it is understandable that trans people, a traditionally oppressed minority, that can be verbally abused in specific ways, can have similar protections.
1.2.5.2.3.6. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that the use of certain pronouns does anything to decrease the number of suicides. Being transgender is much more complex than calling someone a few things.
1.2.5.2.3.6.1. Con: [Use of chosen names decrease depressive symptoms](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X\(18\)30085-5/abstract) so the use of certain pronouns is likely to have a similar effect.
1.2.5.2.3.6.1.1. Con: Chosen names and pronouns are different. Just because the use of a chosen name reduces depressive symptoms is no guarantee that the use of a specific pronoun will have the same effect.
1.2.5.2.3.6.2. Con: Even if it does not decrease suicides, it certainly produces more harm than good.
1.2.5.2.3.6.2.1. Pro: Using preferred pronoums, while a small gesture, is a sign of respect and acceptance so it may be very important.
1.2.5.2.3.7. Pro: Social pain is real. It's humane to help these people feel better, instead of sticking to something which is cozy and familiar to some, yet hurtful to others.
1.2.5.2.3.7.1. Con: Laws are not created to be "humane."
1.2.5.2.3.7.1.1. Con: If laws are not created to be humane, they arguably serve no worthwhile purpose.
1.2.5.2.3.7.1.1.1. Con: The main goal of the law is [debatable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_law#Normative_jurisprudence) and could change between different cultures. They could serve to make order in society and not needing to be humane.
1.2.5.2.3.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Making order essentially means reducing chaos. Chaos in the colloquial sense involves violence and invasions of human rights. Thus, making order is a pursuit in reducing violence. Finally, because reducing violence is a humane objective, then making order is a humane objective.
1.2.5.2.3.7.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Colloquial definitions, as chaos and order here, shouldn't be what we use to define something as important as "the goal of laws", because their ambiguity would lead us to unwanted consequences. In this example, one could argue that killing all the humanity would reduce violence forever and would bring eternal order, therefore killing all humanity is humane, as it makes order, but this is obviously unwanted
1.2.5.2.3.7.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Order is sometimes used against compassionate objectives, for example in strict immigration policies
1.2.5.2.3.7.1.1.2. Con: There is a school of thought about jurisprudence called [Legal positivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_positivism) that defends that "there is no necessary connection between law and morals".
1.2.5.2.3.7.2. Con: Mandating speech is not "humane."
1.2.5.2.3.8. Con: One of the side effects of puberty blockers used to medicate trans-identifying pre-teens is suicidal ideation, such as Lupron [www.rxlist.com](https://www.rxlist.com/lupron-depot-375-side-effects-drug-center.htm#overview)
1.2.5.2.3.9. Con: The putative threat of suicide by a mis-gendered subject is no argument for enforcing the use of new pronouns. Rather, it points to the need of suitable counselling for the subject. Suicide is a personal choice.
1.2.5.3. Con: Learning a handful of new, uncomplicated words isn't difficult.
1.2.6. Con: Making pronouns mandatory may encourage unwelcome questions about gender identity.
1.2.6.1. Con: Not if there are also gender-neutral pronouns that can be used if one does not want to reveal their gender.
1.2.7. Con: If the speaker passionately believes that gender as a social stereotype does active harm to society, and that biological sex is the only reason to have male/female pronouns, the preferred pronouns of an individual may be antithetical to them despite all wishes to be polite and respectful.
1.2.8. Con: Negative outcomes are created when other people can control how comfortable and accepted ultimately feel throughout the day. The likelihood in everyone accepting you is very small, therefore, you will ultimately feel unaccepted and uncomfortable.
1.2.9. Pro: Asking someone their preferred name shows care and compassion for an individual who may desperately need the love and compassion.
1.2.9.1. Con: This should be a goal as societal standard rather than mandated by law.
1.2.10. Con: Gender neutral terms will not change the emotions people project on one another. People will continue to be insecure about their identity despite any passage of laws.
1.2.10.1. Con: Such a law is not about curing insecurities but about removing factors that pressure people and thus strengthen insecurities.
1.2.11. Pro: It is common respect to call somebody by their chosen name and not some other name. Denying to call a person by their chosen name is a bullying tactic. The same goes for chosen pronouns.
1.2.11.1. Con: It is not the governments job to force everyone to respect each other
1.3. Con: Mandating pronouns will ultimately harm pro-LGBT causes.
1.3.1. Pro: Because you can't force people to speak to or about someone, mandating pronouns will cause people to excise transgenders from conversation and ultimately, consciousness, which undermines the goal of acceptance and inclusion.
1.3.2. Pro: The use of preferred pronouns signals voluntary respect. Mandating the use of pronouns undermines a queer person's ability to assess certain qualities in others as well as ascertain safety.
1.3.2.1. Con: Voluntary respect is better than no respect. Anyone can act respectful and actually be a harmful person, but that also happens in many different situations, such as feigning innocence to manipulate someone.
1.3.3. Pro: Mandating pronouns can breed resentment due to the right of freedom of speech being sacrificed for a minority group.
1.3.4. Pro: If the law sets penalties for misgendering, trans people basically become walking liabilities. These kinds of laws will dis-incentivize employers from hiring trans people, thereby reducing job prospects for this already very marginalized group.
1.3.4.1. Con: Laws generally consider [intent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention_\(criminal_law\)) \([dolus](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/dolus)\) in order to be applied. Therefore laws are able to not convict when something is done mistakenly or to only convict when something is done on purpose.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: For example, laws determine if something was made due to racial bias or not, if an action was made willingly or not, if an omission \(with taxes, for example\) was made on purpose or not, etc.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Customers who refuse to accept compelled speech, who are worried about misgendering or being falsely accused of misgendering, or who are politically against trans rights may avoid using businesses with trans staff.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Customers avoiding an establishment that employs trans staff can make business and those in charge lose money, which is not a good prospect.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Lawsuits will be weighted against people accused of misgendering if gender is considered to be self-determined \(by the individual and not others\), fluid and not based on sex at birth.
1.3.5. Pro: Allowing people of various gender identities to interact will cause the people who are less familiar and less educated about different gender identities to learn and have their minds changed on their own. This is a far better outcome for all than using the legal system to silence people who are merely ignorant.
1.4. Con: Compelling people to say things they don't want to say sets a dangerous precedent.
1.4.1. Pro: Although mandatory pronouns are a minor infringement of human rights, the policy may open the door to far more severe infringements.
1.4.1.1. Con: The "slippery slope" is a logical [fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope#Non-fallacious_usage).
1.4.2. Con: Social rules are often based on forcing people to say or do things in favor of others in order for communities to work. If people cannot be forced to behave a certain way or avoid saying some things they want to say \(like discriminating slurs, for example\), social coexistence can be at risk.
1.4.2.1. Con: Positive action in a social context is rarely, if ever, legally enforced \(and most certainly not within the rules of politeness\). For example, although it is considered good manners, one is not legally required to say "bless you" or "thank you." Similarly, one should not be forced to use a certain pronoun, much less punished for non-compliance. That would be compelled speech, which modern legal systems have stayed away from—and for a good reason.
1.4.3. Con: Requiring people to not use incorrect pronouns when referring to others isn't "compelling people to say things they don't want to." It's limiting their speech, yes, in the same way that prohibiting people from yelling "Bingo" in a bingo hall is limiting speech. But, if I demand everyone call me by "he/him," I'm not compelling anyone to talk about me, or to use pronouns if they do—only that if they use pronouns, and talk about me, they must use the right ones. That's not compelled speech.
1.4.3.1. Con: It is compelled speech the moment the government can intervene and punish one for not complying.
1.4.3.2. Con: By definition, a chosen pronoun can not be "incorrect," since it depends solely on the personal preference of one individual and has no absolute truth that can be easily and objectively agreed upon by others.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: If a chosen pronoun depends solely on the personal preference of the individual then there is indeed a right pronoun \(the one that the person choses\) and an incorrect one \(any other\).
1.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: It is the same with personal names. There can be many spellings and pronunciations, which one is correct will depend on the personal preference of the person \(or their parents when they named them\) making one spelling and pronunciation correct for that person and others incorrect.
1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Con: First names are not chosen. One is born biologically male or female and with an assigned name \(legally, for both cases\). What one decides to go by later in life is not an agreed upon objective truth, but a mere personal preference. Others may or may not agree to comply with it.
1.4.3.2.1.2. Con: Right or wrong is not a matter of personal preference. Something that only one person can judge to be correct or incorrect is not, by any stretch of the definition, an objective truth.
1.4.3.2.1.2.1. Con: The main point is precisely that it is not about an objective truth but a personal preference. And within personal preferences, one thing can indeed be right for one person and wrong for another.
1.4.3.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: It is the same with taste, which is a preference. One meal can be objectively good \(good ingredients, well cooked, well presented\) and someone may not like that meal. That means that is not the right meal for that person, even if it is objectively good.
1.4.3.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: One person may prefer a certain product, a certain color or a certain service which means those are the right ones for that person. They may not be objectively the best in every regard, or it may be impossible to determine why one is better than other, yet those are the right ones for a specific person, even if not objectively the best.
1.4.3.2.1.2.2. Con: Personal preferences are not based on objective truth, they are, by definition, personal and subjective.
1.4.4. Pro: Compelling people to say certain things when they don’t agree with them has enormous historical precedent, generally in oppressive dictatorial regimes. Policing the speech of individuals, when that speech is not hate speech or a similar crime, is a tool of totalitarianism.
1.4.4.1. Con: Refusing to acknowledge a person's status has enormous historical context too. De-humanization and deliberate mischaracterization have been used for oppression again and again, often in support of totalitarianism.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Just like regulating speech has been used by totalitarian regimes.
1.4.4.2. Con: One argument to defend restricting the freedom of speech when talking about hate speech is [the \(real\) harm principle](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/#MilHarPriHatSpe), which could also be applied in the use of gender pronouns if we expand the concept of harm to the mental realm.
1.4.4.3. Con: Not calling somebody by their chosen name \(or pronoun\) is demeaning and bullying and thus a form of hate speech. Therefore it is allowable to compel people to use the right form \(but not to restrict the content of what they are saying\).
1.4.4.3.1. Con: Actually, that does not qualify as hate speech \(at least not in [America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States)\).
1.4.4.3.2. Con: There are numerous reasons why one would not call someone by their preferred name. For example, one could—without bad intentions—accidentally misgender someone. That is far from bullying.
1.4.4.3.2.1. Con: Proposed laws may and probably will take that into account. If one misgenders someone else by mistake, that may not be grounds for suing or punishment. It may only be when the misgendering is repeated, deliberate and intentional and that is something the affected party, as with laws, will have to prove.
1.4.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.4.5. Pro: The U.S. government has never had the power to compel speech, and it never should. Other countries that have compelled speech laws do not have anything like the 1st Amendment. Compelled speech is a tool of an authoritarian world-view.
1.4.5.1. Con: What the U.S. government has never done in the past should not bear weight on what it will do in the future. It is only natural that, within a given government, some laws will inevitably be introduced for a first time.
1.5. Pro: Freedom of speech should not include discrimination and/or labeling. Moreover, languages evolved during the course of history, so their evolution should continue in accordance with the humanistic values that include equality.
1.5.1. Con: The evolution of language should be descriptive, allowing the changes to happen naturally, rather than prescribed by others.
1.5.1.1. Con: Laws already prescribe speech according to what a society deems acceptable or not. Past forms of referring to African Americans are now considered racial slurs and could give grounds for suing. There is no reason why laws cannot act the same way for other oppressed groups.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: There has almost never been a law written to compel speech because language is formed through social dictations of morality and it would be unethical to change that now because a particularly small minority group desires such.
1.5.2. Con: Labelling based on biological sex is important for individuals to have their needs met in society. Biological sex differences dictate medical needs, reproductive issues, physical strength and so on. The use of pronouns to differentiate between the sexes exists for various useful and important reasons.
1.5.3. Con: Labeling is exactly what language is used for. Limiting language because it is used for labeling is counterintuitive.
1.5.4. Con: Saying what free speech should or should not include is not free speech.
1.5.4.1. Con: As this [source](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/#IntBouDeb) points out: "Free speech is simply a useful term to focus our attention on a particular form of human interaction and the phrase is not meant to suggest that speech should never be limited"
1.5.4.2. Pro: [This source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech), references four \(4\) sources, published from as early as 1859 to as late as 2015, states that, "Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or sanction." Free speech and freedom of speech are used synonymously.
1.5.5. Con: Equality is maximized when freedom of speech is not limited.
1.5.6. Con: Humanistic values, never mind the inherent subjectivity, have not and should not be the ultimate precedent for the evolution of language.
1.5.7. Con: Allowing hate speech is what lets us find and eliminate the troublemakers, and maybe even convert them. To ban hate speech is to make it more likely for misguided people to become malicious people and for malicious people to retaliate violently. We'd rather hear hate speech than see hate crimes
1.5.7.1. Con: This is a [slippery slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope) argument, the connection between banning hate speech and malicious people retaliating violently is not clear.
1.5.7.1.1. Con: It could be a slippery slope, but that is avoided by applying sensical standards. The idea of banning speech we deem hateful is a much worse slippery slope. To allow hate speech is our current law, so it'd be no more slippery than the status quo.
1.5.7.2. Con: Using the same reasoning, allowing people to do what they want to do is what lets us find and eliminate the troublemakers, and maybe convert them. So we shouldn't have any law restricting our actions. This is an unwanted consequence in any society, because we need laws and order
1.5.8. Con: Language cannot evolve to destroy their basic features.
1.5.8.1. Pro: Just because some languages can function without gender does not mean all can. Romance languages \(Spanish, French, etc.\) use gender as a basic grammatical principle. While some languages, unlike English, function without gendered pronouns, Romance languages use gender even more extensively than English. Every noun has a gender in Spanish. To abolish gender in Romance languages would pretty much require the abolition of the language.
1.5.8.1.1. Con: There are some [proposals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_neutrality_in_Spanish) in Spanish to make gender neutral words and pronouns, so you could abolish gender in romance languages without the abolition of language
1.5.8.1.1.1. Pro: Some examples are the gender neutral pronoun "[Élle](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=es&sl=es&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fes.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2F%25C3%2589lle)" \(instead of "él"/"ella"\) and the use of the "e" in words that need the gender at the end: "todos" \(masc.\) and "todas" \(fem.\) would be changed by "[todes](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=es&sl=es&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eldiario.es%2Fzonacritica%2FTodas-todes-historia-disidencia-gramatical_6_659044117.html)" \(neutral\)
1.6. Pro: Some [languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_type_of_grammatical_genders) do not have grammatical gender, in some cases not even [pronomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_neutrality_in_genderless_languages): so they use pronouns regardless of people's gender or sex. If some languages can function like this, there is no reason why others cannot.
1.6.1. Pro: This option doesn't force someone to say their gender \(because it could be seen as a private matter\) when they need to engage in a conversation.
1.6.1.1. Con: But then it would be the opposite of what transgenders want, they want to be a different gender and the gratification of being called a male or female is what they're after.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: While many trans people are [gender binary](https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/resources/Understanding-Non-Binary-July-2016_1.pdf), some are not and thus would be fine with gender-neutral pronouns.
1.6.2. Pro: It equalizes the value of all genders.
1.6.2.1. Pro: [Genderless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_neutrality_in_genderless_languages) languages are a better option than underlining an individual's social role, gender or sex.
1.6.2.2. Con: Pronouns are not statements of value. They are an ad-hoc determination of what a person mostly looks like, male or female, and your best guess is going to be correct nearly 100% of the time with almost every person alive, with only a tiny number of people that look ambiguous or identify as something else. We are intuitively competent at detecting gender based on appearance, and express that in some languages, English included. No value statement whatsoever.
1.6.2.3. Con: Usually value is related to usability or usefulness. Just saying everything should have equal value ignores the fact that not everything does by virtue of not being the same thing in the first place.
1.6.2.3.1. Con: Being of a particular gender has no bearing on an individual's value. Ergo, the value of all genders should be equal.
1.6.3. Con: Some languages require the speaker to consider someone's gender. For example: [Russian verb in a past tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_grammar#Past_tense) - the speaker needs to use different forms, depending if they're speaking to a man, or to a woman. Therefore adopting gender-neutral speech places higher burden on some speakers.
1.6.4. Con: If some forms of communication already function like this, there is no reason not to use them instead of manipulating existing languages.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Through the history of humanity, humans have adopted languages with features they preferred, and abandoned their old languages. This is why the languages spoken in various places have changed over time.
1.6.4.2. Con: There are reasons not to use another languages, one of them that you have to learn that language before using it, which takes time, when it's just easier and faster to manipulate existing languages.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: People choose to learn new languages all the time because it is faster and easier than manipulating existing languages.
1.6.5. Con: The English language is not merely the dictionary. It is a collective understanding of the meaning of words as a means of communication. If “woman” generally means adult human female \(biologically\) to most English speakers, then asserting that it means something else is meaningless until there is general agreement.
1.6.5.1. Con: Nobody wants to change the meaning of established words and concepts. The concept "female" may not always be [well defined](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/beyond-xx-and-xy-the-extraordinary-complexity-of-sex-determination/) on a [biological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex) and genetical level to begin with. For people, "woman" means a person who looks like and acts like that role, not a person who has certain genitals or genetical traits.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: If we take into consideration trans men, like producer and speaker [Buck Angel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Angel), it is certainly challenging to categorize someone with that manly appearance as female, regardless of chromosomes or genitals.
1.6.6. Con: A government couldn't effectively enforce a change to such a basic function of an already established language.
1.6.6.1. Con: Governments can enforce them as languages are dynamic systems, even thought it can take a lot of time. In Sweden [a new gender-neutral pronoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hen_\(pronoun\)) was proposed in 1966 and accepted as a real Swedish word in 2014.
1.6.7. Con: Nobody is denying that it could work; that is beside the point. One simply cannot change a language by force, especially an aspect of it which a vast majority of speakers take no issue with. If it hasn't happened naturally, chances are, it's neither desired nor practical.
1.6.7.1. Con: No change in language has happened "naturally". It was always the language of the most powerful people who had the most impact on language development.
1.6.8. Con: Just because some languages do this, does not mean every language should.
1.6.9. Pro: More languages should rather head towards simplifying the use of pronouns and for example use one for all, at least if the other option is to create more of them.
1.6.10. Con: Functional feasibility of language doesn't consider the implications of free vs compelled speech.
1.6.11. Con: -> See 1.5.8.1.
1.7. Con: Chosen or new pronouns break traditional standards of what it means to be male/female.
1.7.1. Pro: According to the LGBTQ 🏳️‍🌈 community, the “B” stands for bi-sexual.  Bi means two. Therefore by self acclamation the community affirms there are two, aka binary, choices for sexuality hence he and she suffice as is.
1.7.1.1. Con: The white stripe in the transgender pride flag represents ["those who feel they have a neutral gender or no gender"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender#Pride_symbols) and the concept genderqueer exists in LGBTQ community for non-binary people, so the community affirms there are people who don't identify with he or she
1.7.1.2. Con: Any gender or sexuality identity is up to the person to define how they would like. Bi-sexual does not always just mean the attraction to two genders, it can be more than two. Also, there are sexualities such as pansexual that do explicitly include more than two genders. Pan means all which is in reference to all genders. Not just male and female.
1.7.1.2.1. Con: The suffix "Bi-" denotes two alternatives. In fact, [in its earliest use](https://www.etymonline.com/word/bisexual?ref=etymonline_crossreference), the word "bisexual" was intended as a synonym of "hermaphrodite" \(or someone with both male and female sexual organs\).
1.7.1.2.1.1. Con: The [understanding](http://www.thisisinsider.com/difference-between-bisexual-pansexual-2018-6) of [Bisexual](https://biresource.org/resources/youth/what-is-bisexuality/) as implicating the existence of only [two genders](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/aj-walkley/bisexual-gender-binary_b_2425081.html) is inaccurate.
1.7.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Bi is the prefix meaning two. If in fact bisexuals claim more than two genders than the term to use is not bisexual. Therefore the B in LGBTQ should be changed to an M for multi sexual
1.7.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: [Historically](https://bisexual.org/?qna=doesnt-identifying-as-bisexual-reinforce-a-false-gender-binary), the origin of the prefix 'bi' meant two orientations, "heterosexual" and "homosexual", not two genders.
1.7.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: The fact that the community may have used a historical category for sexual orientation -that may be right or wrong- is not solid prove against gender being a spectrum.
1.7.1.2.1.1.1.3. Con: In fact, the word [pansexual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pansexuality) or even queer has been adopted in the community precisely to avoid gender binarism.
1.7.1.2.1.1.1.4. Con: Bisexual, as defined by most people who are bisexual, means "attracted to genders similar to one's own and different to one's own". This does not imply there are only two genders.
1.7.1.3. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.1.1.
1.7.2. Pro: Because these pronouns are binary based on sex. If we start basing it on the nuances of how masculine or feminine someone is then everyone could demand a pronoun for themselves. Which would create chaos
1.7.2.1. Con: We may just use the pronoun the person indicates they feel comfortable with.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: We may not get it right initially, but following a simple command is not more difficult that changing miss to misses or mister to doctor.
1.7.2.2. Con: Pronouns are based on gender, not sex, neither of which are truly binary.
1.7.3. Con: Traditional standards are not important.
1.7.4. Con: [Almost every continent](http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/content/two-spirits_map-html/), through all recorded history, has had cultures which include multiple genders. Gender roles and definitions vary between areas, cultures, and time periods. Gender is a cultural concept that's constantly changing, and accepting that change is more effective than attempting to resist progress.
1.7.5. Con: There have always been exceptions to societal "standards".
1.7.5.1. Con: Exceptions do not inherently better society.
1.7.6. Con: Traditional standards of what it means to be male or female are constantly changing, for example a female is no longer just a housewife in much of the western world. Changing traditions is not a bad thing in these cases.
1.7.6.1. Con: Male and female are physical attributes and can't change. Despite the continuous change in social roles, pronouns should always identify physical sex.
1.7.6.1.1. Con: Pronouns always refer to gender, not sex, as they are personal identifiers.
1.7.7. Pro: It would break traditional standards by confusing personal choice and sexuality with biological gender assignment. There is no choice of gender.
1.7.7.1. Pro: There are biologically only two chromosomal compositions so the adoption of new gender pronouns would be simply incorrect.
1.7.7.1.1. Con: While chromosomes X and Y generally define a person's sex, there are numerous [variations](http://www.who.int/genomics/gender/en/index1.html) that include monosomies \(one gene\) or polysomies \(more than two\).
1.7.7.1.2. Pro: Science has proven this norm throughout the animal kingdom.  To deviate with unconventional language confuses effective communication and learning within a society.
1.7.7.1.2.1. Con: [Science on sex and gender is developing, moving toward recognition of a spectrum.](https://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943)
1.7.7.1.2.2. Con: The use of new, unconventional pronouns would only inhibit "effective" communication and learning within a society if the goal of communication and learning were to be maintaining the status quo, i.e. enforcing a gender binary. Such a goal is neither objective nor universal.
1.7.7.1.2.3. Con: In the animal kingdom some [animals](https://allthatsinteresting.com/sequential-hermaphrodotism-sex-changing-animals) are hermaphrodite or change sex during their lifetimes.
1.7.7.1.3. Pro: Gender is a biologic absolute. There are two choices: male or female.
1.7.7.1.3.1. Con: Biological sex and gender are often correlated, but they do not mean the same thing. Biological sex relates to the chromosomes, hormones, skeletal structure, genitals, secondary sex characteristics, etc. while gender relates to a social construct which varies between cultures and shifts over time.
1.7.7.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #1570: Gender \(the [concept](http://www.med.monash.edu.au/gendermed/sexandgender.html) of masculinity and femininity\) is a social construct.
1.7.7.2. Con: -> See 1.7.7.1.3.1.
1.7.8. Pro: Language should always be linked to reality, and reality is that a person's gender is not subject to freewill but phisically determined. Language should reflect that.
1.7.8.1. Con: Gender is a neuropsychosocial phenomenon. Conflation of sex with gender is not reason enough to alter linguistics.
1.7.9. Pro: Self-identification is great, yet there are only two genders. Whichever one identifies with should be respected \(man or woman\). Creating new pronouns to more or less say the same thing is really unnecessary. "He and she" or even "they" if people do not identify with the former but thereis no need to make new words.
1.7.9.1. Pro: There are only two genders in pretty much every animal, plant or any other life form. Some are interchangeable but still only male and female.
1.7.9.2. Con: Gender and sex are not the same thing. Gender is a neuropsychosocial phenomenon, while sex is anatomical and endocrine. Regardless, there are more than two of both.
1.7.10. Con: Chosen or new pronouns break traditional standards of what it means to be male/female, freeing people from them.
1.7.10.1. Pro: Chosen pronouns increase an individual's freedom to define themselves. Increased freedom is good.
1.7.10.1.1. Con: It is only increased freedom for the ones benefiting personally from greater pronoun variety. Everyone else \(i.e. those who would have to change their speech by law\) would find their freedom reduced.
1.7.10.1.2. Con: Individuals are already free to define themselves however they wish, and request that others do so too.
1.7.10.2. Con: Freeing people from "traditional standards" is not an inherently positive form of change.
1.7.11. Con: Tradition is nowhere near a good enough reason to devalue someone's identity and humanity.
1.7.11.1. Con: Refusing to use an invented pronoun does not devalue someone's humanity.
1.7.11.1.1. Con: Refusing to refer to someone as they wish to be referred is refusing to acknowledge their personal identity. Identity is a key part of what makes someone human- it is the essence of their humanity. Thus, refusing to use someone's preferred pronouns devalues that individual's humanity.
1.8. Pro: This could help improve the lives of a marginalized and often discriminated group.
1.8.1. Con: People resent being told what to say. So it is more likely that enforcing the use of preferred pronouns will result in marginalized people being further discriminated against, in ways that cannot be proven or prevented by law. E.g. social exclusion.
1.8.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.
1.8.3. Con: One can respect the self-perception of another without being required to agree with it. It is wrong to conflate a difference of perception about someone's identity with discrimination.
1.8.3.1. Con: It is wrong to conflate personal disagreement with a right to invalidate someone's identity.
1.8.4. Con: Language should be the last place people go to improve the lives of the marginalised. Not least because it is an utterly superficial way to improve things.
1.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.2.3.
1.8.6. Con: Mandating pronouns by law can just mask deeper and worse problems.
1.9. Pro: It allows people to decide their own identity and base their personality upon their identity rather than guidelines set by societal stereotypes.
1.9.1. Con: Identity is not defined by pronouns. If one's identity is dependent on which pronouns another uses for one, one has bigger problems which will not be solved by changing the pronouns by which one wishes to be referred.
1.9.2. Con: People can do all of this without compelled speech in place.
1.9.3. Con: There is zero personality communicated in a pronoun.
1.9.3.1. Con: There is zero personality communicated in a name. Still people find it very impolite to be addressed by a wrong name.
1.9.4. Con: This forces other people to use a specifically decided set of guidelines and stereotypes, and the "other people" mentioned here are the vast majority.
1.9.4.1. Con: A guideline should not be denied just because it affects "the vast majority" of a population.
1.9.5. Con: It is not mandatory to refer to a man as 'he' or a woman as 'she'.
1.9.5.1. Con: It may not be mandatory, but it is very impolite to mix that up. Just like calling somebody by a wrong name.
1.9.6. Con: Sex is neutral, societal prejudices towards sex are not. They are called gender. Choosing between sterotypes - he/she validates the sterotype system. Non binary still validates the system as it as it needs the sterotypes to stay in place to have any meaning as not conforming to either. Therefore it is meaningless and so better sex is used to make referring to people easier
1.9.6.1. Con: Non-binary expands the binary system. Nobody wants to do away with the current system, it should only be more inclusive.
1.9.6.2. Con: Sex is not a better system, because sex also is non-binary. Shall [this person](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Buck_Angel_Headshot.jpg) use the ladies bathroom? Because according to sex, he should go there.
1.10. Con: New pronouns are too vague, too confusing or incorrect.
1.10.1. Pro: Pronouns are a “[closed class”](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-closed-class-words-1689856) in English, meaning that an unknown pronoun \(not “he”, “she”, or “they”\) is typically not recognised—it will often be interpreted as a noun/name. This linguistic process is difficult to overcome.
1.10.2. Con: A label is provided for the convenience of the other party in a discussion. It's not a sorting hat.
1.10.3. Pro: Chosen pronouns leads to difficulties in communication.
1.10.3.1. Pro: Language is about communication. If gendered pronouns have no communicative utility, they will fade from the language. If that happens, so be it, but we don't really have the authority to handicap peoples' ability to communicate efficiently and effectively. Even if we did, people would just find another way to communicate gender.
1.10.4. Con: “They” has been used as a singular pronoun since the 14th century at least. [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they)
1.10.5. Con: The fact that the language history proceeded with unjust practices does not justify the ongoing unjust usage. Unfortunately sometimes mandatory applications can be applied to revert the historical unjustices/inequities.
1.10.6. Pro: Language evolves naturally and should not be artificially constructed by laws and regulations.
1.10.6.1. Con: This is a [naturalistic fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy), the fact that language usually evolves naturally is not an argument to defend it should.
1.10.6.2. Con: If languages are artificially constructed and evolve according to social norms and culture, there is no reason why laws \(which are part of social norms\) cannot play a part in that construction.
1.10.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.10.6.2.2. Con: Yes, there is no reason why laws cannot "play a part" - but each case must be carefully discussed, and only where it seams reasonable it might be worth using law instead of social norms.
1.10.6.3. Con: If the benefits of laws regulating language \(i.e.: making a marginalized community feel respected and accepted\) outweigh the disadvantages \(people having the burden to get used to ask and respect pronouns\), there is no reason why language should not be modified, as they already evolve and change all the time.
1.10.6.4. Pro: Language is influenced by people who use it and invent new usage that is both functional and valuable. Innovation is done by innovators - not enforcers. Government should encourage change and innovation, but not jump to conclusion as to what will work.
1.10.7. Pro: If everyone was allowed to choose their pronouns out of an infinite list of posibilities, the simplest correspondence would be an impossible task.
1.10.7.1. Pro: Enforcing the use of pronouns for 63 genders is impractical.  Enforcing use of fewer gender pronouns will be seen as non-inclusive. Language should change through common use, not through legislation. [63 Genders](https://apath.org/63-genders/)
1.10.8. Con: If in doubt, simply use the gender-neutral pronoun "they". Gender-neutral means it applies to everyone, regardless of gender.
1.10.8.1. Con: Except someone might not want to be called "they," which means that the use of that specific gender neutral pronoun could still be inappropriate.
1.10.8.1.1. Con: What one prefers is simply that, a preference, it is not necessarily "inappropriate" just because one does not prefer it.
1.10.8.2. Con: The whole point of the gender-fluid concept is that some people do not identify with either of the binary genders. Simply adding a third traps them into a third 'gender' that they may not identify with. It's missing the whole point.
1.10.8.3. Pro: It would benefit sciences such as biology to cement the fact that gender and sex are two different things by making it mandatory to recognize this.
1.10.8.3.1. Con: They are different as gender is a social construct based loosely upon the roles that the sexes have filled due to reinforcement by society for generations.  He and She could easily apply to the sex of the individual, and would if society stopped constructing gender roles in the first place.  Therefore, pronouns should be tied to an individual's sex because the result of breaking down the socially constructed norms concerning gender is the elimination of gender.
1.10.8.3.1.1. Con: If pronouns were strictly used on the basis of physical anatomy, "he" and "she" would still be insufficient given the existence, physical diversity, and experiences of intersex individuals.
1.10.8.3.1.1.1. Con: People who have one of the various intersex characteristics are a very small percentage of the population, and often identify with the sex they are identified as at birth. We should avoid making whole of population rules for a very few who largely haven’t even asked for pronouns to be self-selected.
1.10.8.3.2. Con: If a scientific theory \(true or not\) requires a law to be made for it to be "cemented", it is not a strong enough theory and should be revisited, strengthened, and challenged in accordance with the scientific method..
1.10.8.3.2.1. Con: If something is "theory" in the scientific sense, it has already rigorously undergone the processes involved in the scientific method.
1.10.8.3.2.2. Con: Individuals often reject Theories regardless of their truth \(e.g. Flat Earthers\).
1.10.8.3.2.3. Pro: Valid scientific theories are naturally adopted by society. Those who don't accept them do not have much influence, and trying to bypass the natural resistance to social change through legal means will just increase resistance.
1.10.8.3.3. Con: You can recognize the difference between gender and sex without policing word use.
1.10.8.3.4. Con: If an idea has merit it will survive all criticisms and dismissals. Legal protections for ideas is the ultimate breach of open discourse and honest critiquing.
1.10.8.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.1.3.1.1.
1.10.9. Pro: It's impossible to police language at this level, that's not the way languages work.
1.10.10. Con: The first time one learns to tie a shoe can be confusing and have many mistakes. With more practice and proper direction the process becomes easier, eventually becoming second nature. Suggesting anything one practices becomes less confusing and better understood.
1.10.11. Pro: While the use of genderless pronouns might be possible for languages that use gendered pronouns, the changing of these basic functions within the language would be too difficult to feasibly enact/teach/enforce effectively.
1.10.12. Pro: People automatically assign gender and can assign pronouns to people without knowing them. It would be difficult to put into practice a system where people must actively ignore obvious physical traits.
1.10.12.1. Con: The gender people automatically assume can be wrong and therefore, using the  pronoun the person feels comfortable with once they have said so is not that problematic.
1.10.12.1.1. Pro: As the differences are less obvious, people often misgenders babies or small children. Once they are told to use another pronoun \("he" for "she", etc.\) they generally do so without complications.
1.10.12.1.1.1. Con: That's when there are only two categories. When you add another few dozen pronouns into the mix, it gets way more complicated to remember.
1.10.12.2. Con: In the same manner that people can refer to others as miss or misses or as doctor or sir, it is not that difficult to call someone they way they want to be called.
1.10.12.3. Con: People should minimize assumptions based on other people's physical traits.
1.10.13. Pro: As gender identity or more accurately gender expression seems quite subjective, it would be impossible to know what a person would prefer to be called beforehand.
1.10.13.1. Pro: New gender pronouns are too vague to be understood by the general public. Unable to determine the subject's "gender identity" from a glance, a person approaching must somehow be informed of the preferred pronoun in advance, in order to correctly communicate with the subject. The proposition of "It must be used" is impossible to enforce in reality.
1.10.13.1.1. Con: Unless a standardized gender neutral pronoun was to start being used for everyone, which doesn't indicate gender in any way.

Such as 'dude', which is frequently used to refer to any person, or animal, occasionally even objects and situations.
1.10.13.2. Con: -> See 1.10.12.1.
1.10.13.3. Pro: Do not get upset or uncomfortable because someone is not able to distinguish you from the two general genders after first impression, just start explaining. The person who wants to alter other peoples perception is the one who needs to teach. How about personalized explanatory personal introduction cards? Sometimes something that is written and can be read discretely can be more comfortably used in social settings.
1.10.13.3.1. Con: There is no "aim to alter perceptions", it's that the perception itself is wrong, and therefore the one who couldn't get it right is the one who needs to learn, for example, asking before saying any pronoun
1.10.13.3.2. Con: Asking people not to get upset or uncomfortable when it's not a choice, but an unavoidable emotional reaction, doesn't make any sense
1.10.13.3.3. Con: It's unreasonable to call on gender-nonconforming people to create greeting cards for themselves when it would be much more efficient to start conversations by asking someone's gender.
1.10.13.4. Con: However, it is not that difficult to refer to someone in the manner they would like to be referred to once they have verbalized it.
1.10.13.4.1. Con: Refering to someone by a certain pronoun is not that difficult, but if legally enforceable, it would be disastrous to enforce something that relied on having pre-existing knowledge of a person's preferred pronouns.
1.10.13.4.1.1. Con: The original premise already addressed this—the law is applicable only when someone repeatedly misgenders someone despite being corrected. It is not intended for people who make a mistake and misgender someone once.
1.10.13.4.1.2. Con: No one is suggesting honest mistakes would be prosecuted, such laws only cover systemic and deliberate harassment through misgendering.
1.10.13.4.1.3. Con: Laws have to be just, logical and proportional and thus they could establish that it is mandatory to respect someone's pronoun once they have stated them, not before.
1.10.13.4.1.3.1. Pro: For example, if an institution like a university or a workplace insist on misgendering someone after they have expressed their preferred pronouns in records and public communications, the person would have a right to sue them.
1.10.14. Pro: Many of the recently established gender identities are self-contradictory. A "gender-fluid" person may change the preferred pronoun multiple times a day, leading to total confusion. If legally enforced, such practice may even lead to manipulation and exploitation in order to extract "compensation" through court.
1.10.14.1. Con: Most laws have caveats that can be used with exploitative goals \(like seeking unfair compensation\) but if overall they are useful to protect those who need it, they should be approved.
1.10.14.2. Con: Most gender-fluid people have a set of pronouns \(for example 'she and they' or 'he or she'\) that are acceptable for them. The fact that they are gender-fluid does not mean they need pronouns to be changed on a daily basis.
1.10.14.2.1. Pro: Even those whose preferred pronouns do change day-to-day typically have a universally acceptable set of pronouns.
1.10.15. Pro: Use of plural pronouns such as them/they/their to refer to individuals is incorrect grammar usage and leads to confusion when attempting to communicate.
1.10.15.1. Con: There are a [variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-person_pronoun#Transgender_pronouns) of alternatives to 'Singular They', E, Ey, Hou, Peh, Per, Thon, Ve, Xe, Yo, Ze/Hir, Ze/Mer, Ze/Zir, Zhe/Zhim/Zher. And that's before you consider importing a singular gender neutral pronoun from another language.
1.10.15.2. Con: Singular "they" has been used for [hundreds of years](https://www.npr.org/2016/01/13/462906419/everyone-uses-singular-they-whether-they-realize-it-or-not) by English speakers and writers like Shakespeare, Austen, Shaw.
1.10.15.3. Con: Language is constantly changing, and when people use a certain word or grammatical construction it becomes [correct](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/using-they-and-them-in-the-singular) usage.
1.10.15.3.1. Con: A minority's misuses of a word does not mean the mainstream understanding of that word can or should change.
1.10.15.4. Con: There is the alternative of "ze, zem, and zeir."
1.10.16. Pro: Pronouns are "in description of", meaning that the use of pronouns is a reflection of the speaker's perception. Therefore while it would be considered "polite" to use a person's chosen pronouns, legally enforcing them or even expecting the use negates and tramples the speaker's ability to express their perception.
1.10.16.1. Pro: The job of pronouns is to provide clarity and context to a sentence. It refers to something mentioned earlier, and which pronoun you use helps clarify exactly what you are referring to. Promoting clarity is the only viable basis for what pronoun you choose to use. "He" and "She" manages this fine. "They" would create confusion more often than clarity. All other suggested pronouns provide no clarity at all.
1.10.17. Con: This implies that communicating to ensure you refer to someone correctly is too great a burden- it's not.
1.10.17.1. Con: It means remembering a different 'pronoun of choice' for every person. Many people have a hard enough time just learning names. The cognitive load of this is not negligible, it's a lot to remember.
1.10.17.1.1. Con: Pronouns are not as particular as names, so they are easily memorable.
1.10.17.1.1.1. Con: The fact that pronouns are not as particular as names has no bearing on how easy they are to remember.
1.10.17.1.1.1.1. Con: The lack of particularity means that pronouns are fewer- there's less to remember, so it's easier to remember them.
1.11. Con: The push into gender fluidity might weaken the feminist movement.
1.11.1. Con: On the contrary, removing gender stereotypes and allowing individuals to be judged by their merits and skills and not by their gender is one of feminism's goals.
1.11.1.1. Con: Basing pronouns on gender rather than biological sex strengthens the damaging social limitations of gender stereotypes, because gender would then be allowed primacy over sex in language.
1.11.1.2. Con: Removing the concept of inherent gender also removes the concept of one gender being inherently oppressed.
1.11.1.2.1. Con: Recognizing the systemic forms of oppression that one gender suffers \(and has suffered\) is actually not incompatible with trying to achieve a situation of equality in which gender does not matter anymore.
1.11.2. Con: Depending on one's perspective, a weakened feminism movement may be good.
1.11.2.1. Con: -> See discussion #6492: Feminism is a force for good in the world.
1.11.3. Con: It is not the role of the state to adjudicate between competing ideologies. If gender fluidity and feminism are incompatible, the conflict should be resolved through public debate, not legislation.
1.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.11.2.1.
1.11.5. Con: Gender-neutral pronouns and [expressions](https://www.totaljobs.com/insidejob/gender-neutral-language-in-the-workplace/) may help to reduce [pay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap) gap and [leaderships inequalities](https://www.academia.edu/6539049/Gender_Hierarchy_and_Leadership_An_Introduction).
1.11.5.1. Pro: Research and anecdotal evidence point that when having a [female](http://fortune.com/2016/06/08/name-bias-in-hiring/) \(or [foreign-sounding](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/05/job-applications-resume-cv-name-descrimination/)\) name in a [resumé](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/work/your-name-no-longer-matters-on-your-cv---heres-what-does/), potential workers may be less likely to get interviews or to get hired.
1.11.6. Con: This is a problem when people mistakingly devalue one thing in the name of another. The feminist movement and gender fluidity are not exclusive from each other. Supporting one does not necessarily hurt the other.
1.12. Con: It would be preferable but should not be legally enforced.
1.12.1. Pro: This should be mandatory only in a professional setting, such as in a court of law or in the workplace.
1.12.1.1. Pro: To make the use of correct pronouns mandatory would mean that individuals would need some sort of punishment for using the wrong pronouns, which would be difficult to enforce, especially in non-professionals environments where there may be no formal record.
1.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.13.4.1.
1.12.3. Pro: Everyone makes mistakes, don't make it mandatory, just preferred.
1.12.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.12.4. Pro: It should be 'mandatory' for government employees acting as government employees. Private individuals should not be punished.
1.12.5. Pro: Even if such practices are perceived desirable by some people it is authoritarian societies rather than free ones that seek to legislate behaviours on the basis of desirability.  There has to be a higher standard of harm to resort to law.
1.12.6. Pro: Gender-neutral pronouns are a need in communication but should not need to be mandatory, simply should be the accepted standard in the evolution o the language.
1.12.7. Pro: It is unreasonable to ask the majority of people to change the way they speak and think for the sake of a very small [minority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexual#Prevalence).
1.12.7.1. Pro: As only 1 in 13,000 to 15,000 people \(.007% to .006%\) of the US is transgender according to 2016 figures, with varying figures cited to include as much as .02 % by The International Journal of Transgenderism, the number of people who would be in the situation of addressing a trans person is negligible and thus would place an undue burden on a huge portion of the population. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexual#Prevalence)
1.12.7.2. Con: By that logic, democracy would always be the [tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority) with no forms of compensation and no laws helping minorities could be approved.
1.12.7.3. Con: Laws shouldn't depend on the number of people they affect.
1.12.7.4. Con: If the amount of transgender people in a given country is small, the chances for a citizen to meet a trans person and having to respect 'chosen pronouns' are very slim as well. Therefore, these laws \(even if made with a minority in mind\) will actually have very little impact on the daily lives of the majority.
1.12.8. Pro: There is no non-arbitrary line at which to legally draw a distinction between honestly chosen titles and nonsense. Such a set of laws could permit people to severely abuse others by requesting a whole range of ridiculous terms be used to refer to them, and have legal protection by simply insisting they genuinely want that to be their identity.
1.12.8.1. Con: Harassment or abuse caveats can be used to counter this.
1.12.8.1.1. Con: It is often difficult to determine who is being genuine and who isn't.
1.12.8.1.2. Con: It would require too much legislation and resources to enforce and check harassment and abuse claims.
1.12.8.2. Pro: There is no way to draft a law that would satisfy all parties while remaining non-exploitable. If the law lists specific pronouns which may be used, people will complain that it excludes their own preference, and demand that the law be extended. If the law allows any arbitrary pronoun, people will be able to make up nonsensical "pronouns" like "Your Grace".
1.12.8.3. Con: Just as we have laws governing a change of name that prevent this kind of abuse, we could have the same for pronouns.
1.12.8.4. Con: When making accusations the legal system would probably consider how reasonable the requested pronouns are.
1.12.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.
1.12.10. Pro: Cis-gendered people already demand that everyone use their preferred pronouns. Intentionally calling a man "she" will generally get social disapproval, including correction, anger, and threats of violence. Therefore, social threats have been shown to be successful to ensure correct pronouns are used, without laws.
1.12.10.1. Con: This fails to take into account power imbalances. While cis-gendered people are able to get their preferred pronouns with social threats and without laws, that may not be the same for trans individuals. Trans people \(especially trans women and even more so trans women of color\) [suffer](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/education/face-facts/face-facts-lesbian-gay-bisexual-trans-and-intersex-people) [discrimination](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/trans-hate-crimes-stats-figures-2017-more-than-third-a8166826.html) and [violence](https://www.hrc.org/resources/violence-against-the-transgender-community-in-2018) more acutely and thus may not be in a position to ‘socially threat’ or even politely ask that they pronouns are respected. That is why laws may be necessary.
1.12.10.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.12.10.1.2. Pro: Trans males and females experience significantly higher rates of non-physical and physical abuse [compared](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/education/face-facts/face-facts-lesbian-gay-bisexual-trans-and-intersex-people#fn11) with cisgendered lesbians and gay men.
1.12.10.1.3. Con: -> See 1.10.8.3.2.3.
1.12.11. Pro: It is not very realistic to expect people to abruptly change how they call someone, it should be introduced slowly and be naturally accepted by people through the common acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community, instead of making it mandatory.
1.12.12. Pro: It is unnecessary to legislate on this issue. There are already legal protections in many jurisdictions against hate speech, harassment, assault etc that protect individuals from harm.
1.12.13. Pro: Choosing to refer to a person by their chosen pronoun is a sign of respect to that person, but should not be mandatory or legislated.
1.12.14. Con: Protection from systemic, deliberate misgendering is as important as protection from racial slurs or gendered discrimination.
1.12.15. Pro: No force is needed, leading by example is enough if good examples are distributed widely enough.
1.12.15.1. Pro: It may be enough that all governmental organisations can enforce gender-neutral speech in all their communications and within the educational system.
1.12.16. Pro: Not all gender non-conforming persons present themselves in such a way that it is clear which pronoun should be used and we should not invite a situation where a person could face potential criminal charges for mistakenly mis-gendering someone they had never met before.
1.12.16.1. Pro: Humans sort everything into categories to make it easy to reference and understand. Pronouns are supposed to help us refer back to a noun with clarity. While it may be easy to use a preferred pronoun when someone informs us, it is virtually impossible for anyone to read someone's mind and know what they prefer \(especially ones like "xi" and "ze"\) We should try out of respect, but it would be incredibly difficult \(and unfair to a speaker who just doesn't know or who gets confused\) to enforce.
1.12.16.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.12.16.3. Con: The specter of real punishment would achieve a cultural change where people verify someone's gender identity rather than assume it.
1.12.16.3.1. Con: Incorrectly assuming a person's gender does not merit legal ramifications.
1.12.16.3.1.1. Con: Therefore legal ramifications should only take place when the incorrect use of pronouns is made on purpose and after there has been a verbal indication of the chosen pronoun.
1.12.16.4. Con: -> See 1.10.13.4.1.1.
1.12.16.5. Con: One can just ask what pronouns to use if unsure.
1.12.17. Pro: It is ultimately the choice of an individual to be offended when they are misgendered. Words are not violence and it objectively doesn't matter or harm, so there is no reason to regulate it.
1.12.18. Pro: Gender-neutral pro-nouns should not become the norm; it is and should stay the responsibility of the person wanting to be addressed in a specific way to make this desire known. It should be the norm to respect a person that is asking for specific pro-nouns.
1.12.19. Con: Laws should reflect the way people live. If misgendering people on purpose is considered discriminatory and wrong, laws should reflect that.
1.12.19.1. Con: Gender dysphoria \(the discontent experienced by some persons resulting from gender identity issues\) affects between 0.01% and 0.6% of the world population \([depending on studies & criteria](http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/How-Many-Adults-Identify-as-Transgender-in-the-United-States.pdf)\). It is unreasonable to make this issue mandatory as it would create unnecessary tensions and may impede gender fluidity acceptance.
1.12.19.1.1. Con: -> See 1.12.7.3.
1.12.19.2. Con: It is not always on purpose, that's the problem.
1.12.19.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.12.19.3. Con: The term "on purpose" is the key here - and many people will not "on purpose" misgender, but due to practical reasons it is impossible to "correctly gender" someone in every case.
1.12.19.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.12.19.3.2. Con: If the person addressed clearly states their gender, it seems fairly easy to address the person that way. At least, as easy \(or more\), as remembering and pronouncing correctly a name.
1.12.19.4. Con: The speaker does not necessarily consider it misgendering.
1.12.19.4.1. Con: Whether or not the speaker consider it misgendering is not relevant to the action being misgendering and therefore causing harm.
1.12.19.5. Con: Laws should not reflect the way people live. Free societies have many competing value systems. The law reflects basic principles preserving that society, such as civil rights and property rights. Amending the law to reflect a minority lifestyle violates the freedom of all other citizens.
1.12.19.6. Con: Not all things that are wrong should be prohibited by law.
1.13. Pro: When referring to something applicable to any/all members of a coed group \(i.e. humankind or another species, and subsets of either/both\) using gender-neutral terms is preferable to listing the membership's full complement of gendered terms, for it cultivates sustainable unity by honoring every member equally.
1.14. Pro: All people have a choice to what they should be called \(i.e. their names which they feel comfortable with\) so pronouns should be no different.
1.14.1. Con: What people want to be called is irrelevant to whether the use of gender-neutral pronouns should be "mandatory." People wanting something \(e.g. not to pay taxes\) should not be a consideration in making it mandatory. The cost of enforcing and prosecuting it, and the real benefits to society of having it, need to be weighed.
1.14.1.1. Con: Not calling somebody by their chosen name is demeaning and bullying. Allowing to call a minority arbitrary names is promoting hate speech. Hate speech is detrimental to society.
1.14.2. Con: Calling a person by their name is not mandatory.
1.14.3. Con: Pronouns are different from nouns.  Pronouns are descriptive but nouns are not.
1.14.3.1. Con: Titles \(miss, misses, sir, doctor, etc.\) are also descriptive, like pronouns, and people can choose them.
1.14.3.1.1. Con: People can only choose titles in the case of Ms, Miss, or Mrs. You cannot chose to be Dr or Lord. You also cannot choose to be Mr while identifying as a woman.
1.14.4. Con: It is immoral to employ armed coercion to "help" people feel emotionally comfortable within society. One's own emotional comfort within their society is their own personal burden to pursue.
1.14.4.1. Con: Emotional wounds are dangerous and they are not that different from physical ones. We have laws for the latter to protect people and [we have some laws for the first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress), so society has some responsibility in emotional comfort of people and it's not a personal burden
1.14.5. Con: People also have a choice in what they call everything ever, including other people.
1.14.6. Con: People neither choose their first name nor their last name. The same is true for pronouns - these are not chosen by the people themselves.
1.14.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.14.6.2. Con: People do chose how they want to be addressed \(mister, miss, misses, doctor, etc.\) there is no reason why pronouns should not be chosen.
1.14.6.2.1. Con: Except you can not get fined \(or otherwise punished by law\) for not addressing these people by their preferred title.
1.14.6.2.2. Con: People don't choose what to be called, a man is always mister and a woman of unknown marital status is ms \(pronounced miz\), an unmarried woman is miss and a married woman is missus. There is no choice, it is appointed.
1.14.6.2.2.1. Con: Women nowadays [choose](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/when-to-use-miss-mrs-or-ms-3514830) the [title](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-40530920) according to what they perceive is better and not always according to their marital status.
1.14.6.2.2.1.1. Pro: The different titles for [women](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/08/mrs-ms-or-miss-why-do-forms-require-women-reveal-their-marital-status) depending on marital status are more and more called into question as sexist and [old-fashioned](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-40530920).
1.14.6.2.2.1.2. Pro: In business etiquette it is advised to [ask women](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/when-to-use-miss-mrs-or-ms-3514830) what title they prefer, instead of guessing or assuming.
1.14.6.2.3. Con: Many titles signify achievement and are not chosen, they are earned accomplishments.
1.14.6.2.3.1. Pro: Doctors don't choose their titles, they have a PhD in their field or have finished med school. Captains and generals are promoted to the title as an achievement. Lord and lady are birthrights handed down by parents and sirs get a knighting ceremony to commemorate achievement. 'Your honour' is for those who graduate from a lawyer to a judge.
1.14.6.3. Con: Adults can change their legal names, therefore there is a high degree of choosing.
1.14.7. Con: Should people be forced to call others by a particular nickname?  If not, then they shouldn’t be forced to call others by a particular pronoun either.
1.14.7.1. Con: That is because [gender identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity) exists and is a studied theme in how gender shapes our identity and affect us, but 'name identity' doesn't.
1.14.7.1.1. Con: Name identity is studied greatly in marketing and advertising. Companies, brands, and celebrities invest a lot of money to get the 'right name'.
1.14.7.1.1.1. Con: The psychological effects behind this branch of marketing are vastly different from the effects we know gender identity has in people, therefore this two concepts aren't comparable.
