Discussion Title: Is Pope Francis a good pope?

1. Pope Francis is a good pope.
1.1. Pro: Pope Francis has made the Catholic church significantly more open and welcoming.
1.1.1. Pro: Pope Francis has tried to [encourage](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/pope-endorsement-softens-stance-on-divorced-catholics) Catholic priests to give communion to some divorced and remarried couples, or to families where unmarried parents are cohabiting. These statements have contributed to division among Catholics.
1.1.2. Pro: Pope Francis is a 'man of the people', coming from a pastoral background, rather than an academic background. Many [feel this aids him](https://theweek.com/articles/685573/why-conservative-catholics-think-pope-francis-fraud) in understanding issues that are relevant for the world's Catholics.
1.1.3. Pro: Pope Francis has explicitly committed to a church "[for the poor](https://www.vox.com/cards/who-is-pope-francis/what-are-the-hallmarks-of-francis-theology)".
1.1.3.1. Pro: If anything, these statements have brought the Church back in line with original Gospel teachings, and away from a prior legacy of greed and extravagance exemplified by the [Indulgences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence) and [Vatican wealth](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/how-rich-vatican-so-wealthy-it-can-stumble-across-millions-euros-just-tucked-away-1478219).
1.1.3.2. Con: Pope Francis has been implicated in a [financial scandal](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/leaked-docs-raise-question-of-popes-personal-role-in-new-vatican-financial).
1.1.3.3. Con: It is not a given that a church which encourages states to take more control over the economy is actually serving the interests of the poor. Francis [argues for this active role](http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html): "charity \[...\] is the principle not only of micro-relationships \[...\] but also of macro-relationships \(social, economic and political\) \[...\]. It is vital that government leaders \[...\] take heed and broaden their horizons, working to ensure that all citizens have dignified work, education and healthcare."
1.1.3.4. Pro: Pope Francis has committed to [leading by example](https://relevantmagazine.com/current/why-pope-so-popular) by rejecting some of the luxury, or 'special treatment', of being Pope. He has opted for smaller, less luxurious living quarters, and has taken public transport.
1.1.3.5. Pro: Pope Francis directed Vatican employees to [donate their bonus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/pope-francis-redirects-employee-bonuses-to-charity/2013/04/18/56a472ce-a85a-11e2-9e1c-bb0fb0c2edd9_story.html?utm_term=.b4718efd1594) they received once he ascended to the papacy to charity.
1.1.4. Pro: Pope Francis [has said](http://www.traditionalcatholicpriest.com/2016/10/14/why-pope-francis-is-a-false-prophet/) that atheists can still go to heaven by doing good deeds in their lives.
1.1.4.1. Con: Therefore, by contradicting "[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_Ecclesiam_nulla_salus)", Pope Francis is committing heresy.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: The catholic teaching is "Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation" \([Paragraph 847 of the CCC](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/847.htm)\) Therefore atheist that still do what we call "good" still have a chance for salvation. Basically one would have to refuse it to not have it.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Previously, Church doctrine stated that [only believers](http://www.traditionalcatholicpriest.com/2016/10/14/why-pope-francis-is-a-false-prophet/) would be admitted to heaven, that good deeds alone were not sufficient.
1.1.5. Pro: Pope Francis has [instructed priests](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/24/false-prophet-why-pope-francis-has-disappointed-many-roman-catholics.html) to allow those who have had abortions to receive Holy Communion.
1.1.6. Pro: Pope Francis has actively encouraged young people to participate and have a say in the running of the Church.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Pope Francis decided that the theme of the 15th Ordinary General Meeting of the Synod of Bishops should be ["Youth, faith, and vocational discernment"](http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2016/10/06/161006b.html).
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Pope Francis encouraged young Catholics to contribute to the Synod of Bishops using [social media](https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2018/02/18/pope-urges-youth-go-online-give-church-earful/) and a specifically youth-moderated [questionnaire.](http://www.usccb.org/about/bishops-and-dioceses/synod-of-bishops/synod-2018/index.cfm)
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Pope Francis wrote a [letter to young people](https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/letters/2017/documents/papa-francesco_20170113_lettera-giovani-doc-sinodo.html) ahead of the Synod.
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: The church has traditionally been steered by the clergy, who are all adult men. The inclusion of youth in the Synod of Bishops shows a willingness to reinvigorate the Church in a way that previous popes have failed to do.
1.1.7. Pro: Pope Francis is very popular with the general public.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Pope Francis is also [notable](https://relevantmagazine.com/current/why-pope-so-popular) for his support among non-Catholics, especially evangelical Christians and Protestants.
1.1.7.2. Pro: The Pope was named '[Person of the Year](https://relevantmagazine.com/current/why-pope-so-popular)' by TIME magazine.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: Time has been known for many [controversial](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/time-magazine-10-controversial-people-year-article-1.2040428) "People of the Year", including Ayatollah Khomeini, Adolf Hitler, and Joseph Stalin. The award itself does not indicate any specific "goodness".
1.1.7.3. Pro: For example, [88% of American Catholics](https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/why-pope-francis-is-so-effective-8-lessons-for-every-leader.html) responded, when asked in a survey, that they think he is doing a good job.
1.1.7.4. Con: The Pope's popularity with the general public comes at the expense of having alienated many of the world's conservative Catholics.
1.1.7.4.1. Con: It is somewhat inevitable that whatever the Pope does will divide the Church. For every Catholic who would like to see their progressive values reflected in their faith, there are staunch opponents of these changes. No matter what the Pope does or doesn't do, he is likely to alienate one of these groups.
1.1.7.4.1.1. Con: The Pope's indifference to the impact of his words and actions is deeply offensive to many conservative Christians, with some concerned that it [may cause a schism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/2015/09/18/francis-is-a-global-sensation-but-to-certain-traditional-catholics-his-message-rings-hollow/) within the Church.
1.1.7.4.1.1.1. Pro: Others offended by the Pope have encouraged Catholics to [demand his resignation](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/06/17/enough-is-enough-pope-francis-should-resign.html).
1.1.7.4.1.2. Pro: Many of the Pope's statements are unpopular because they reflect his political/ social opinions, but many of the controversial statements are [not actually contrary to Christian doctrine](https://theweek.com/articles/685573/why-conservative-catholics-think-pope-francis-fraud).
1.1.7.4.1.2.1. Con: Others, such as his statements surrounding who can receive communion, are [not in line with existing Church doctrine](https://theweek.com/articles/685573/why-conservative-catholics-think-pope-francis-fraud).
1.1.7.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: The Pope’s doctrinal chief Gerhard Mueller [opposes](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-pope-conservatives-2017-story.html%3FoutputType%3Damp) the Pope’s suggestion to allow remarried Catholics to take communion.
1.1.7.4.1.2.1.2. Pro: Pope Francis has said that Catholics in [mortal sin](http://www.traditionalcatholicpriest.com/2016/10/14/why-pope-francis-is-a-false-prophet/) should still be allowed receive Holy Communion, something that was previously prohibited.
1.1.7.4.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Pope Francis has explicitly said that Catholics in a state of mortal sin [CANNOT receive communion](http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2018/03/15/pope-francis-if-you-are-in-a-state-of-mortal-sin-you-cannot-receive-communion/) without going to confession.
1.1.7.4.1.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.7.4.2. Pro: A good Pope is one who is able to unite people under his leadership. But the Pope’s liberal attitude towards religious matters has left the Catholic Church bitterly divided.
1.1.7.4.2.1. Con: On other matters the Pope has shown a more conservative attitude. For example, despite the Church's move away from use of the devil in their teachings, Pope Francis has made so many references to 'the devil' and 'evil' that some have called it an '[obsession](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/20/living/pope-francis-devil/index.html)'.
1.1.7.4.2.1.1. Con: The frequency of how often they are referenced is irrelevant as the concept of ‘evil’ and the existence of the ‘devil’ is central to the Christian belief shared by both conservatives and liberals.
1.1.7.4.2.1.1.1. Con: While the devil is central in earlier Christian teachings, modern Catholic doctrine avoided teachings on the devil, due to [fear](http://www.beliefnet.com/faiths/christianity/why-the-church-doesnt-preach-on-hell.aspx?p=2) it would alienate modern Catholics. In emphasising Church teaching on the devil, Pope Francis has reconnected with a more traditional Christian belief.
1.1.7.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: Large sections of the Bible refer to [demons and the devil](https://www.crosswalk.com/church/pastors-or-leadership/ask-roger/why-don-t-pastors-preach-and-teach-more-on-demons.html).
1.1.7.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.4.1.2.1.1.
1.1.7.4.2.3. Pro: Pope Francis replaced the conservative [doctrine chief](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4657528/Pope-Francis-shakes-Vatican.html) further emboldening the divide between conservative and liberal members of the Church.
1.1.7.4.2.4. Pro: Some priests have accused Pope Francis of [heresy](http://www.traditionalcatholicpriest.com/2016/10/14/why-pope-francis-is-a-false-prophet/) for his efforts to modernise Church doctrine.
1.1.7.4.2.4.1. Con: Pope Francis, being God's representative on Earth, has more legitimate grounds on which to decide what is heretical and what is not than priests.
1.1.7.4.2.4.2. Con: Previous popes were also [accused of heresy](https://cruxnow.com/commentary/2017/02/12/since-francis-continuity-tradition-critics-arent/).
1.1.7.4.2.4.2.1. Pro: St. John Paul II was [accused](https://cruxnow.com/commentary/2017/02/12/since-francis-continuity-tradition-critics-arent/) of modernism and syncretism.
1.1.7.4.2.4.2.2. Pro: Benedict XVI was accused of [modernism and heresy](https://cruxnow.com/commentary/2017/02/12/since-francis-continuity-tradition-critics-arent/).
1.1.7.4.2.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.7.4.1.
1.1.7.4.2.5. Con: Pope Francis has reached out to the [Old Catholic Church](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-reaches-out-to-schismatic-old-catholic-church-28251).
1.1.7.4.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.7.4.2.7. Con: There is no sign that the number of people united under the Pope leadership is diminishing. [More and more convert everyday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_population_growth). Therefore that pope must be a good pope.
1.1.7.4.2.7.1. Con: The number of individual conversions may only marginally have anything to do with the present pope.
1.1.7.4.2.8. Con: The purpose of the pope is to represent God, not appease people’s desires on what they fallibly think is good and bad. The most relevant way to evaluate whether the pope is good is whether he does what God says, and how good these things are cannot be captured by immediate outcomes. Radical human utilitarianism is not compatible with a belief that a God -who knows infinitely more than we can-determines right and wrong.
1.1.7.4.2.9. Pro: Pope Francis himself admits unashamedly that his progressive views may render history holding him responsible for “[having split the Catholic Church](https://onepeterfive.com/pope-francis-reported-words-might-go-history-split-church/)”.
1.1.7.4.2.10. Con: -> See 1.1.7.4.1.
1.1.7.4.2.11. Pro: His approval rating with conservative Catholics is [much lower](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/2015/09/18/francis-is-a-global-sensation-but-to-certain-traditional-catholics-his-message-rings-hollow/) than his general approval rating. While nearly 90% of American Catholics approve of Francis, only 45% of conservative Catholics approve of him.
1.1.7.4.2.11.1. Con: If nearly 90% of Catholics approve, that is huge. Pope Benedict [never reached](http://news.gallup.com/poll/127058/pope-benedict-favorable-rating-drops.aspx) more than 81% and Pope John Paul II at his very best was only 86%.
1.1.7.4.2.11.2. Pro: This approval rating has [dropped significantly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/2015/09/18/francis-is-a-global-sensation-but-to-certain-traditional-catholics-his-message-rings-hollow/) in a year, from 72% to 45%.
1.1.7.4.2.12. Pro: Many conservative Catholics feel [deserted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/2015/09/18/francis-is-a-global-sensation-but-to-certain-traditional-catholics-his-message-rings-hollow/) by his weak stance on issues such as contraception and abortion and betrayed by his tolerant stance on moral issues.
1.1.7.4.2.12.1. Pro: Pope Francis offended many Catholics by suggesting their marriages could be considered invalid, [claiming](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/06/17/enough-is-enough-pope-francis-should-resign.html) "the great majority of our sacramental marriages are null".
1.1.7.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.4.2.11.
1.1.8. Pro: As the first Jesuit pope, Pope Francis has brought in the Jesuit community that had previously largely been estranged from the Catholic Church.
1.1.9. Con: Pope Francis has a track record of extreme homophobia. His papacy is a clear sign that the Catholic church does still not recognise LGBTQ* individuals as equal.
1.1.9.1. Pro: He has [reaffirmed](https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/lgbt-advocates-express-frustration-over-vatican-document-barring-gay-priests) the Catholic Church's ban on ordaining gay priests.
1.1.9.2. Pro: Despite other claims the Pope has previously made, he remains [opposed to same-sex marriage.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/pope-francis-warns-that-same-sex-marriage-threatens-the-family-and-disfigures-gods-plan-for-creation-9986028.html)
1.1.9.3. Con: Francis has publicly advocated for Catholics to [apologise to the LGBT community.](https://www.advocate.com/religion/2016/6/27/pope-francis-catholics-should-apologize-lgbt-community)
1.1.9.4. Con: A Pope represents the catholic church. Until the catholic church doesn’t consensually decide to adapt its policy to LGBTQ principles, a Pope is not expected to do so. LGBTQ is still a very argued topic in many areas, and a conservative church might take much longer to accept it, if it ever does.
1.1.9.5. Pro: Even as pope, Francis has [not changed](https://www.vox.com/cards/who-is-pope-francis/what-is-francis-attitude-toward-gay-people) the church's doctrine on LGBTQ* issues.
1.1.9.5.1. Con: Insofar as religion is concerned, the Pope does not have the authority to countermand the will of God on the subject. Specifically, [Leviticus 18:22](http://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-22.htm) says that engaging in homosexuality is a sin, therefore the Pope can not say otherwise.
1.1.9.5.1.1. Pro: Many bishops and cardinals believe that the Pope has [no jurisdiction or ability](https://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/20/world/catholic-church-change/index.html) to change the doctrine of the church, but an obligation to preserve it.
1.1.9.6. Pro: Pope Francis compared arguments for transgender rights to [the nuclear arms race.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/pope-francis-compares-arguments-for-transgender-rights-to-nuclear-arms-race-10061223.html)
1.1.9.7. Con: Pope Francis has been the most accepting Pope of the gay community to date, [asking](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/27/the-war-against-pope-francis) "Who am I to judge?" in their regard.
1.1.9.8. Pro: He has [described](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/2869221) same-sex marriage as the work of the devil and a “destructive attack on God’s plan.” He has also said that gay adoption is a form of discrimination against children.
1.1.10. Pro: Pope Francis has stated that the church should apologise for its ["blessing of many weapons"](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/26/483630582/pope-francis-church-should-apologize-to-gays-and-other-marginalized-groups), specifically against women, children, the LGBT community, and the poor.
1.2. Con: According to orthodox teachings, a fundamental principle of Catholic thought is that the church exists in [continuity](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2013/09/pope-francis-looks-to-st-vincent-of-lerins) with its past traditions. Pope Francis advocating for doctrinal reforms represents a violation of this principle, rendering him as a dangerous figure for the Catholic Church.
1.2.1. Pro: The pope advocating for [marriage reforms](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3225392/Pope-reforms-Roman-Catholic-marriage-annulment-procedures.html) opens the door for other doctrinal changes thus jeapordising the integrity of Catholic teachings.
1.2.2. Pro: Advocating for doctrinal reforms undermines the countless sacrifices people have made over time to uphold the central teachings of the Catholic tradition.
1.2.2.1. Con: This same argument could be made of any change leading to never changing the institution whatsoever. Instead it makes sense for the leader of the Church to look at how the Church navigates its role for followers in the context of the world at that time.
1.2.2.2. Con: The fact that sacrifices were made to uphold these teachings does not mean that these teachings should be upheld indefinitely.
1.2.3. Con: Interpretations of Scripture have always been subject to change and development over time. Not adapting to meet the demands of a forever evolving world undermines the relevence of the Catholic Church and its teachings in the lives of people.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Mass attendance has significantly fallen in America and Europe, especially among young adults because the Church is viewed as ["irrelevant to their lives"](https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/parish-diary/attempt-answer-question-where-are-young-adults).
1.2.3.2. Pro: The Catholic Church practiced slavery for many years and did [not condemn](http://www.globalblackhistory.com/2015/11/the-role-of-the-roman-catholic-church-in-slavery.html) it until the 17th century.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Pope Pius IX stated that slavery was ["not contrary to the natural and divine law."](http://www.globalblackhistory.com/2015/11/the-role-of-the-roman-catholic-church-in-slavery.html)
1.2.3.3. Pro: The church teachings used to [condemn](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/history-shows-the-church-has-changed-its-moral-teachings-1.437230) the modern liberties of freedom, equality and participation of citizens in civic and political life.
1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.4.2.4.
1.2.5. Con: Pope Francis justifies his doctrinal changes by appealing to what he calls the ["law of progress"](http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/10/11/pope_francis_the_dynamic_word_of_god_cannot_be_moth-balled/1342352); that is, that the real truth present in Jesus' teachings becomes more apparent to us as our understanding improves.
1.2.6. Pro: Many of Pope Francis' doctrinal changes and beliefs fundamentally contradict the Church's previously held positions on issues.
1.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.2.6.2. Pro: Pope Francis has spoken out against the [death penalty](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/pope-francis-bucks-catholic-teaching-calls-death-penalty-contrary-to-the-go).
1.2.6.2.1. Pro: The Catholic Church's previous position on the death penalty was that it was to be tolerated as a legitimate punishment and effective tool for protecting the rest of society.
1.2.6.2.2. Pro: While other popes have opposed the death penalty, Pope Francis is the only pope to have ever declared the death penalty to be "intrinsically evil".
1.2.6.2.3. Con: Opposing the death penalty is breaking away from scripture; both the Old and New Testaments condone the death penalty.
1.2.6.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.
1.2.6.2.3.2. Pro: There is a [number of offences](https://www.thedailybeast.com/all-the-things-the-bible-wants-to-execute-you-for) that the Old Testament explicitly say are worthy of the death penalty.
1.2.6.2.3.3. Pro: The New Testament [accepts the death penalty](https://carm.org/capital-punishment-new-testament) as a legitimate tool to be used by the state.
1.2.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.2.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.2.7. Pro: One of the central tenants of the Catholic church is that it [teaches](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/27/the-war-against-pope-francis) Eternal Truths. Going back on the principles of previous Popes violates this notion.
1.2.7.1. Con: It would only be a violation of this notion if the current Pope had contradicted what another Pope said in ex cathedra. It is not necessarily wrong for Popes to disagree on non essential matters of faith.
1.2.8. Con: Many of the positions which hold the church are [becoming](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/27/the-war-against-pope-francis) more and more untenable, such as absolutely no use of contraceptives or remarriage, nor are they always enforced. Pope Francis is simply recognizing this.
1.2.8.1. Con: Deposit of Faith contains eternal truths, which are objective, immutable and consistent. Any potential addition to the teaching of the Church is just consistent application of eternal principles, revealed publicly by Christ, to a new situation. Every new proposition contradicting the deposit of Faith is false and must be rejected. This applies regardless of fashions and whims of the society. 1+1 = 2 is always true, whether people assent to it or not.
1.2.9. Con: The pope is well aware of the work of St. Vincent \(with whom he is [quoted](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2013/09/pope-francis-looks-to-st-vincent-of-lerins) in the parent's source\). St. Vincent's work respects the principle of continuity, meaning that while Pope Francis may be in favor of making changes, these are likely to remain minor changes. Respecting the principle of continuity and Church traditions.
1.2.10. Con: Past traditions are useless if it is irrelevant to the population it intends to protect, guide and represent.  It is the Teachings of Christ, not traditions of the Catholic Church, that is more important above anything else
1.2.11. Pro: This is a constant and abiding critique of the catholic institution of the papacy. None can truly define what is good but God and true Christianity is to follow Him, not another human who claims to represent Him. \(We are all the imago dei, as per Genesis ch 1-3\).
1.3. Pro: Pope Francis has brought about a decentralisation of power in the Church.
1.3.1. Pro: Local bishops now get to control the [liturgical translation](https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2017/09/09/pope-pushes-decentralization-translation-liturgical-texts/) used in their diocese.
1.3.2. Con: In keeping with his wish to give more power to individual countries over their running of the church, Pope Francis has reached an agreement with the Chinese government that gives the latter some power over who is appointed as bishops in China, despite [warnings](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/02/15/pope-francis-is-playacting-realpolitik/) from the retired bishop of Hong Kong and from Catholics within China about how this could harm Chinese Catholics.
1.3.3. Pro: Decentralisation of power means more accountability. Increased accountability  will provide a greater incentive for members of the Catholic Church to conduct themselves more responsibly thus improving the overall standards of the Church.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Bishops would have more [authority](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUKKCN0SB0UI20151017) to make decisions affecting the lives of people in their local communities instead of always looking to Rome for a centralised decision that has to fit all. So if any problems were to arise, more accountability would fall upon the shoulders of Bishops instead of Rome.
1.4. Pro: Pope Francis is making the Catholic church about original Christian values again.
1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.4.1.2.1.2.
1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.4.3. Pro: One of the key messages Pope Francis has highlighted throughout his papacy is [mercy](https://theweek.com/articles/685573/why-conservative-catholics-think-pope-francis-fraud), something that challenges Catholics who are rigid and judgemental towards their peers, and brings the Catholic doctrine back to original Gospel teachings on this subject.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Pope Francis has called for an end to Catholics' ["contempt for the weak".](http://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope-francis/mass-casa-santa-marta/2018-01/pope-at-mass--_contempt-for-the-weak-is-work-of-satan.html)
1.4.3.2. Con: In promoting mercy and forgiveness, Francis offered clemency to a priest accused of sexual abuse, who was later [convicted by an Italian criminal court](http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/02/27/pope-reduces-sanctions-against-some-paedophile-priests/) for said abuse. Promoting theoretically good ideals can still lead to negative outcomes.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: This actively undermines survivors' trust in the church, making it less likely for them to come forward in the future and ultimately continuing the cycle of lacking accountability that has plagued the church.
1.4.4. Con: Promoting Christian values is the bare minimum of what any pope should do, but no hallmark of a particularly good pope.
1.4.4.1. Con: Given that [many popes](https://www.livescience.com/8606-7-unholy-pope-scandals.html) have committed deadly sins and broken the Ten Commandments, Francis' promotion of Christian values is worth noting and commending.
1.4.4.2. Con: Given that he is the head of the Catholic Church, promoting Catholic values should be his primary concern.
1.4.5. Con: Restoring original Christian values would require calling the cardinals to a third Vatican, to consider revoking the doctrine of [Papal Infallibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_infallibility). Infallibility was established under [Pope Pius IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_IX), against tradition, in response to [Italian Unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_unification) and wars over the Papal estates. Dropping the doctrine of infalibility would make it possible for the Roma Catholic Church to evolve. Francis hasn't made such a call, so is not restoring anything of substance [\(see also Kertzner 2004\)](http://www.davidkertzer.com/books/prisoner-vatican).
1.4.5.1. Con: "The Catholic Church does not teach that the pope is infallible in everything he says; official invocation of [papal infallibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_infallibility) is – apart from canonizations of saints – extremely rare. And those are usually regarded as not of divine faith, as they depend on facts that post-date New Testament revelation." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_infallibility). Therefore dropping it wouldn't make much change and allow people to reconsider the infallible claims made before. Which might cause more division in the church.
1.4.6. Pro: Supporting refugees and poor people needing to be fed, Pope Francis is close to [Jesus Christ's vision](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A35-40&version=ESV) of what religion should be.
1.4.7. Pro: Pope Francis declared that church officials need to incorporate the values of [humanity, humility, and acceptance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/21/pope-francis-list-needed-virtues-catholic-church-christmas) into their teachings and lives.
1.4.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.5. Pro: Pope Francis is linking Catholic doctrine to current global issues, showing the church's relevance for the entire world.
1.5.1. Pro: Pope Francis has [spoken out about the migrant crisis](https://theweek.com/articles/685573/why-conservative-catholics-think-pope-francis-fraud) facing Europe.
1.5.1.1. Pro: He also praised Bangladesh for taking in Rohingya refugees from Myanmar and called on countries "[that close their doors](https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2017/12/02/pope-francis-explains-why-he-did-not-use-word-rohingya-myanmar)" to do better.
1.5.2. Con: It is not the pope's place to get involved in politics - his main task is the spiritual guidance of Catholics all around the world.
1.5.2.1. Con: From its inception the Church has been charged with following the example of Jesus; speaking and acting in the world as a sign of God's love. The speaking of truth, or what is believed to be truth, is validated by action. Humans tangibly demonstrate what they believe through action. Catholics, including the Pope, are not constrained to being guiding voices but also actors.
1.5.2.2. Con: [The Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraph 1914](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c2a2.htm): "Participation \[in social life\] is achieved first of all by taking charge of the areas for which one assumes personal responsibility: by the care taken for the education of his family, by conscientious work, and so forth, man participates in the good of others and of society." Therefore, if a Catholic, including the Pope, has a political role they are exhorted by the Church to act within that capacity.[vatican.va](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c2a2.htm)
1.5.2.3. Con: Morality \(and thus spirituality\) applies to every sphere of human activity. If the papacy is valid and right, it is valid and right for them to make judgments on things we label ‘political’.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.2.
1.5.4. Pro: Pope Francis has used his platform to raise awareness of [human trafficking](https://www.romereports.com/en/2018/02/09/pope-francis-our-society-sometimes-tolerates-and-encourages-human-trafficking/).
1.5.5. Pro: Pope Francis openly [opposes capitalism](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/08/02/pope-francis-capitalism-terrorism-against-all-humanity).
1.5.5.1. Pro: The Pope has [condemned](http://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2018-02/pope-francis-usury-financial-exploitation.html) usury and financial corruption.
1.5.6. Pro: In a time of environmental pollution and climate change, Pope Francis emphasizes the Catholic church's responsibility for [protecting the environment](https://www.vox.com/cards/who-is-pope-francis/what-are-francis-views-on-the-environment).
1.5.6.1. Pro: When he met President Trump ahead of the US’s momentous decision to leave the Paris climate accord, Pope Francis [gave](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/08/pope-francis-listen-to-the-cry-of-the-earth/) him a copy of Laudato Si, his 2015 encyclical - the highest form of papal writing - on climate change.
1.5.6.2. Pro: In 2015, Pope Francis designated [September 1st](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/08/pope-francis-listen-to-the-cry-of-the-earth/) as the church’s day for prayer for the environment.
1.5.6.3. Pro: Pope Francis has publicly denounced [climate change denial](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/9/11/16290546/pope-francis-climate-change-deniers-daca).
1.5.7. Pro: Pope Francis prioritizes engaging issues in all their complexity [in the "frontier" rather than in the"lab](https://catholicmoraltheology.com/francis-frontiers-and-theological-labels/)."
1.5.8. Pro: Pope Francis was a [key actor](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/cuba/11873213/How-the-Pope-played-a-crucial-role-in-US-Cuba-deal.html) in restoring diplomatic relationships between the USA and Cuba.
1.5.8.1. Pro: Pope Francis invoked key Catholic tenets of reconciliation and peace in a [letter](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/19/pope-francis-cuba-us-reconciliation-havana) to the leaders of the two nations.
1.6. Pro: A good pope is one who represents Catholics and their concerns across the world as good as possible - Francis does exactly that.
1.6.1. Pro: "Good" does'nt mean "Right" or "Benevolent". Pope Francis represents Catholic People and they approve of him as their Leader. Studies have shown most Catholics approved of him, in all the world. His lowest approval rate is of 71% in [Ghana.](http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/12/11/pope-francis-image-positive-in-much-of-world/) In Argentina where he comes from, [he reaches 98% of approval](http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/12/11/pope-francis-image-positive-in-much-of-world/). In conclusion he is "good" to represent them.
1.6.2. Con: The Papal office is not representative in nature. The office is derived from Matthew 16:13-21 in which Peter claims Jesus is the Messiah and then authority is entrusted to Peter, with the Popes claiming their authority as a delineation of what they believe was given to Peter by their identification of him as the first Pope. The measurement then of a good pope is then not by approval but by a pope's testimony of Jesus as Messiah. [Matthew 16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16&version=NIV)
1.7. Con: Any perceived change Pope Francis has made to the church as an institution is purely cosmetic and surface level.
1.7.1. Pro: The Pope has openly defended the church's [opposition to contraception](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/16/pope-francis-catholic-church-contraception), despite [evidence](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/addingitup2014.pdf) on how it would improve the situations of impoverished people and nations.
1.7.2. Pro: Pope Francis has [not made any meaningful changes](https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/examining-crisis/pope-francis-abuse-disappointment) to hold priests who have been accused of sexual abuse accountable or to prevent it occurring in the future. He has merely paid lip-service to victims of the scandal.
1.7.3. Pro: As recently as the [27th of August](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/28/vatican-erases-popes-remarks-about-psychiatric-help-for-gay-children), Pope Francis said that gay children might need psychiatric treatment.
1.7.4. Pro: While appearing socially progressive with some statements, he has been [hypocritical](https://qz.com/511809/pope-francis-is-not-a-progressive-he-just-has-terrific-pr/) in doing so without any change of church doctrine.
1.7.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.
1.7.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.2.
1.7.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.5.
1.7.4.4. Pro: Pope Francis still opposes the [ordination of women](https://www.vox.com/cards/who-is-pope-francis/what-is-francis-attitude-toward-women).
1.7.4.4.1. Con: While opposing the ordination of women, Pope Francis is increasingly concerned with figuring out ways to honour the [importance of women](https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2013/09/30/big-heart-open-god-interview-pope-francis) in the Catholic Church. He does not use rhetoric of subservience to justify his position against ordination.
1.7.4.5. Pro: Pope Francis has condemned technology which makes [gender reassignment easier.](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/pope-condemns-technologies-make-gender-transitions-easier-n808081)
1.7.5. Con: The Pope is not solely responsible for reform. The Vatican's administration team [continues to block](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/21/pope-francis-says-reforming-vatican-hard-cleaning-sphinx-toothbrush/) changes that Francis is proposing.
1.7.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.5.1.1.
1.7.5.2. Con: Pope Francis has already [made reforms](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/pope-francis-launches-reform-of-vatican-bureaucracy-with-cleanup-of-vatican-bank/2013/10/18/28b99ecc-3430-11e3-89db-8002ba99b894_story.html?utm_term=.7fbbdfada5d8) in the Vatican's bureaucracy, which indicates he has the power to change the hierarchy that's holding back his reforms.
1.7.5.2.1. Con: As time has gone on, Pope Francis has faced increasing bureaucracy and opposition to his proposed changes, [failing to follow through](https://theweek.com/articles/685573/why-conservative-catholics-think-pope-francis-fraud) on reforming Vatican attitudes to money, or internally investigating clerical sex abuse,.
1.7.5.2.2. Con: Pope Francis has expressed [regret](https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2013/09/30/big-heart-open-god-interview-pope-francis) at being too unilateral in his decision making as the superior of a province of the Society of Jesus. Seeking to be more consultative and persuasive when making reforms can lead to more acceptance of the result on a wider scale.
1.7.5.3. Pro: The majority of the Vatican's positions of powers are held by [conservative clergy](https://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/20/world/catholic-church-change/index.html) who oppose change. It will take time for Pope Francis to reverse this and implement progressive change to doctrine.
1.8. Con: What the church needs is a pope who can take it into the 21st century, and Francis has failed at doing that so far.
1.8.1. Con: Pope Francis has set [new education standards](https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2018/01/29/pope-francis-issues-new-education-standards-future-priests) for priests, including being taught about challenges to faith in modern times and how to deal with them.
1.8.2. Con: Pope Francis has a more pragmatic and flexible view of the [celibacy of priests](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/10/pope-francis-married-men-could-be-ordained-to-ease-priest-shortages) than any of his predecessors.
1.8.3. Con: The church is a centuries old institution seeped in tradition, and its previous progressiveness reflects that. It's unreasonable to expect one Pope to be able to speed the church's progress to that degree.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Many of the decisions Pope Francis has made, such as choosing to elevate more moderate bishops into positions of leadership within the Church, will [leave a legacy](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-pope-francis-matters_us_55d370dee4b07addcb443e0c) that will be felt in years to come due to their ability to have an influence in continuing the progression and moderation of a very traditional institution.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: Pope Francis has set a precedent that popes should be able to progress and influence Church doctrine and teachings; future popes will find it easier to do the same as a result.
1.8.4. Con: Pope Francis has broken previously held Papal traditions, such as when he [washed the feet](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/the-pope/9960168/Pope-washes-feet-of-young-Muslim-woman-prisoner-in-unprecedented-twist-on-Maundy-Thursday.html) of a female Muslim prisoner.
1.8.5. Con: Christ’s followers believe that God determines what is right and wrong, good and bad. Not the whims of humans, whatever century they live in. Evaluating the pope according to what the current pop culture believes is good is irrelevant to His followers. It simply has no purchase.
1.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.4.
1.8.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.5.
1.8.8. Con: Older people are [more likely](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/56280/1/democraticaudit.com-Age_significantly_impacts_on_the_choices_that_voters_make_at_elections.pdf) to be conservative in their views. While it is the 21st century, it is not unreasonable for a Pope born before World War Two to have 20th century values.
1.8.8.1. Con: By this logic, it would be excusable for the church to always stay several decades, if not an entire century, behind ongoing societal change across the world.
1.8.9. Con: It is more harmful to have the Church change too quickly for its members to be able to adjust to and accept the changes.
1.8.9.1. Pro: If the members of the Church don't accept the changes and leave the Church for another Christian church more in line with their views, the Pope loses his sphere of influence, which is counterproductive.
1.8.9.2. Pro: [50% of US Catholics](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150917-data-points-how-catholic-population-has-shifted-in-the-united-states/) are aged 50 or over. As older people are [more likely to be conservative](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mr-personality/201410/why-are-older-people-more-conservative), drastic progress change could drive them from the Catholic Church.
1.8.10. Con: -> See 1.1.10.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.9.
1.10. Pro: He is the first pope to ever address the Catholic church's rampant sexual abuse crisis.
1.10.1. Pro: Unlike his predecessors, Pope Francis did not try to avoid dealing with the issue; he set up a committee to investigate alleged sexual abuse by the clergy. He did not give up, even when the committee faced great obstacles in the form of corruption; instead, he [revived](http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-vatican-pope-abuse-20180221-htmlstory.html) the committee this year.
1.10.2. Pro: Pope Francis regularly meets with [survivors](https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2018/02/15/pope-francis-reveals-meets-victims-sex-abuse-fridays/) of Church sexual abuse.
1.10.3. Con: In 2015, the Pope received a [letter](http://time.com/5133127/pope-francis-chile-sexual-abuse-coverup/) from a survivor of sexual abuse in Chile, detailing the abuse and subsequent cover up. The Pope later denied having any knowledge of the abuse.
1.10.3.1. Con: Pope Francis probably doesn't open every letter sent to him by himself.
1.10.4. Con: Pope Francis [lessened the sanctions](http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/02/27/pope-reduces-sanctions-against-some-paedophile-priests/) against some clergy members accused of sexual abuse.
1.10.5. Con: -> See 1.7.2.
1.10.6. Con: He has also accused victims of clerical sex abuse in Chile of [slander.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/19/pope-francis-victims-church-sexual-abuse-slander-chile)
1.10.6.1. Con: The Pope [apologised](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42780327) for these remarks, recognising that abuse victims often do not have proof of the abuse that took place.
1.10.6.1.1. Con: An apology is not sufficient when he refuses to accept the Bishop's resignation and stands by him, making a [public statement](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42780327) that is deeply offensive and upsetting for victims of clerical sex abuse across the world.
1.10.6.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.1.
1.10.6.2. Con: The Pope has since sent an [envoy](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/pope-francis-sends-envoy-to-chile-to-investigate-abuse-cover-up-1.3374239) to investigate the same bishop he had previously defended.
1.10.7. Pro: Francis expressed [extreme regret](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/16/pope-francis-pain-and-shame-sexual-abuse-children) about the clerical sex abuse that people have suffered from in the past.
1.11. Con: The Catholic church is a structurally and historically extremely harmful institution. Anyone who agrees to head it without fundamental reform is a bad pope.
1.11.1. Pro: The Catholic Church defended and encouraged torture as a means to gain confession during the [Inquisition](https://listverse.com/2011/06/08/top-10-shameful-moments-in-catholic-history/).
1.11.1.1. Con: [Most of existing states](http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/images/journals/docs/pdf/st/June07STFeature.pdf) have encouraged torture as a means to gain informations or to force someone to admit a crime during their internal and external conflicts in their history. Therefore the past acts of torture can't be used to estimate an actual Head of State to be a good Head or not.
1.11.2. Pro: The Catholic Church was [opposed](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/27/the-war-against-pope-francis) to the democratic revolutions in France, Italy, and much of Europe favoring a monarchy that was detrimental to the population.
1.11.3. Pro: Pope Francis is still part of a Institution which enforces superstition and wishful thinking, which has no place in this time of environmental climate catastrophe.
1.11.4. Con: -> See 1.7.5.
1.11.5. Con: The Pope cannot be blamed for the shortcomings of the Catholic Church in the past just like a newly elected leader of a country cannot be blamed for the shortcomings of previous administrations.
1.11.5.1. Con: While a newly elected leader is not morally responsible personally for the shortcomings of previous administrations, they would have a moral responsibility in their role to right wrongs done by previous administrations.
1.12. Con: -> See 1.1.7.4.2.
