Discussion Title: Congress and the Senate should impose term limits on Representatives

1. Congress and the Senate should impose term limits on Representatives
1.1. Pro: It may lower corruption, since elected representatives will have less power.
1.1.1. Con: It could increase corruption, as those elected representatives will have less time to cash in.
1.2. Pro: Elected members would not spend that much time fundraising for reelection and could focus on their constituents.
1.2.1. Con: That could be solved by imposing prohibitions on time spent raising money, not just limiting terms.
1.2.2. Con: A new [study](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/elections/term-limits-legislator-research) found that politicians who have the ability to serve another term are actually more productive.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Lawmakers who cannot be reelected "sponsor fewer bills, serve on fewer legislative committees and skip more roll-call votes", according to the University of Chicago and Stanford University [study](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/elections/term-limits-legislator-research).
1.2.3. Pro: It is estimated that elected officials spend more than half their [time](https://www.termlimits.com/congress-fundraising-priority/), sometimes even 6 to 8 hours a day, fundraising instead of working on legislation.
1.3. Con: It is undemocratic: citizens should be able to choose who they want as elected officials.
1.3.1. Con: Since the executive branch \(for example, the President\) has term limits, it is difficult to see why terms limits on the legislative would be undemocratic.
1.3.2. Con: With term limits, citizens are still able to choose their representatives. The only condition is that after certain time, they cannot be elected anymore.
1.3.2.1. Con: But what if after that period of time, citizens still feel that that person is their best representative? Then people will be deprived of that choice.
1.3.3. Pro: Democracy should not put limitations on the people's will.
1.3.3.1. Con: For democracy to function, limitations and regulations are necessary.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: For example, people vote on a specific district and are only able to vote for those who run in those districts and cannot vote in a different district.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Voters in the US have to be registered and over 18.
1.4. Con: Congress and Senate will not be able to count on the experience and valuable knowledge of senior lawmakers.
1.4.1. Con: The absence of experience may affect the governing body in the short term, but long term it would result in far less corruption and more transparency.
1.4.1.1. Con: Transparency can be improved with laws that mandate it. How long a lawmaker holds office may not affect how transparent or not the process is.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: For example, more protection could be given to [whistleblowers](https://transparency.eu/priority/global-eu/#whistleblowing) that expose or denounce corruption.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: The right to access information should be more protected, inclusing  measures such granting immunity \(with limitations\) to those who release documents [\(p. 50\)](http://www.diva-portal.se/smash/get/diva2:636890/FULLTEXT01.pdf).
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: Officials should be made responsible to preserve electronic information, "making  sure  that  they  register  personal  emails  with  the  agency,  keep  a  copy,  or  forward  emails  received  on  their  private  email addresses" [\(p. 51-52\)](http://www.diva-portal.se/smash/get/diva2:636890/FULLTEXT01.pdf).
1.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: Courts  could be  more  active  in reviewing processes, “design the appeal procedure in a way to eliminate adverse incentives, restrict the way government officials may use their electronic devices” as well as “educate government officials  on  the  legal  rules  concerning  transparency  and  access  to  official  documents/public  records” [\(p.53\)](http://www.diva-portal.se/smash/get/diva2:636890/FULLTEXT01.pdf).
1.4.2. Pro: Senior representatives have established relationships with think tanks and policy advocates, to help write meaningful legislation. Term limits would greatly reduce time available to forge these relationships.
1.4.3. Con: Incumbents can be advisors but they can't vote. If what they have to say is valuable they will share it
1.5. Pro: Term limits exist at the Executive Branch, they should be in place for elected law makers as well.
1.5.1. Pro: Most voters on states with terms limits across parties support them.
1.5.1.1. Pro: In Florida, where there are term limits, 76% of voters voted in favor. [A nationwide poll](https://www.fedsmith.com/2018/04/19/congressional-term-limits-without-constitutional-amendment/) conducted by McLaughlin & Associates found that 82% of voters support Congressional term limits, including 89% of Republicans, 83% of independents, and 76% of Democrats.
1.5.2. Con: The responsibility and power of the executive branch are not comparable with the legislative branch.
1.5.2.1. Pro: In the US, for example, the President has [legislative](https://www.thoughtco.com/legislative-powers-of-the-president-3322195) powers. Elected officials, by themselves only, are not able to pass legislation, and so their responsibility and potential to corrupt the system or to become depots is far inferior.
1.5.2.2. Con: This is correct. The powers of the President are dwarfed when compared to the powers retained by Congress under the Constitution \(Ref US Const, Art I & US Const, Art II\)
1.5.3. Con: Most modern term limits [internationally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_term_limits) affect only  presidents or similar figures.
1.6. Pro: Elected office was never meant to be a career.
1.6.1. Pro: If elected officials spend most of their lives as politicians, instead of owning business or working, they become disconnected to the actual need of the working population.
1.6.1.1. Con: Being an elected official is a job too. They have schedules, meetings, goals and requirements to meet, superiors to report to, etc. Therefore, they can understand the struggles of the working population.
1.6.2. Con: If elected officials are good at their job and serve their constituents well, elected office may be a legitimate career.
1.6.3. Pro: Lawmakers should be making decisions on what's best for their constituents. If public office is a career, then representatives could be more likely to make decisions based on what is best for them personally, rather than the collective.
1.6.4. Pro: The Founders intended for this to be a part time role to serve the states and the nation, not to be a lifetime career of self aggrandizement and power grabbing. [mic.com](https://mic.com/articles/61831/what-would-the-founding-fathers-do-about-congressional-term-limits-today#.ZOHlD93NS)
1.7. Con: This could impede the lawmaking process and swing votes
1.8. Con: It is unconstitutional, as ruled by the Supreme Court in 1995.
1.8.1. Con: Amending the Constitution to allow terms will solve the problem if there is enough political will.
1.8.1.1. Con: Changing the Constitution is a [difficult](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/05/01/sorry-trump-term-limits-for-congress-are-still-not-going-to-happen/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.77d902f3a2f7) process. A two-thirds supermajority in Congress \(both chambers\) is necessary as well as the ratification by three-fourths of states or 38 out of 50.
1.8.1.1.1. Pro: It is unlikely that sitting members of Congress and Senate who plan on being reelected vote on a constitutional change that would not allow them to run again.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Con: There is always the alternative process of proposing amendments, a Convention of the States that must be called upon application of 2/3 of the state legislatures. Amendments so proposed must still be ratified by 3/4 of the states, but Congress has no say in this process. \( [US Constitution, Article V](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlev)\)
1.8.1.1.2. Con: The question of whether something is difficult is different than whether it’s the right thing to do.  Even if it is difficult to adopt such an amendment, it’s worth a shot if it’s the night thing to do.  And if you can convince enough people it’s the right thing to do, then the difficulty decreases.
1.8.1.2. Con: Constitutional amendments cannot be imposed by Congress, only proposed. The initial basis of this calls for Congress to impose term limits, which as has been stated, is not within their authority to do.
1.8.2. Con: Laws are meant to be changed if needs arise and there is enough social and political consensus.
1.9. Pro: Being a career representative is a conflict of interest. One is elected to represent the voters, not rule.
1.9.1. Con: A term-limited representative no incentive to do what those in her district wish, and are completely free to be as self-serving as they like without fear of concequences at the hands of their voters.
1.9.2. Pro: Politicians spend more time on personal re-election fundraising than on the legislative duties. A true representative would spend the most time researching and determining the district priorities that best serve the district, state, and nation.
1.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.10. Con: Would make lobbyists more powerful.
1.10.1. Pro: Most [political scientists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/05/01/sorry-trump-term-limits-for-congress-are-still-not-going-to-happen/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.5ddb8097efa1) agree that limiting terms would only empower the infrastructure around Congress, giving more power to lobbyists and the media.
1.10.1.1. Pro: There are no [rules](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/05/01/sorry-trump-term-limits-for-congress-are-still-not-going-to-happen/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.5ddb8097efa1) about how long these lobbyists can hold their profession and thus they could spend years "gaining expertise on the intricacies of legislating that term-limited members of Congress simply wouldn't or could never have".
1.10.1.2. Con: "Power corrupts..." Incumbents' urgency becomes reelection. They prioritize influence opportunities to the powerful lobbies that offer the most. If they have only one-term to affect change it will impose urgency on doing the right thing while you have the chance.
1.11. Pro: Would pave the way for young lawmakers who may be more in touch with their constituents
1.11.1. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that "young lawmakers" are more in touch with their constituents. In fact, most peope, as they mature and gain more life experience, tend to become more atuned to the opinions and feelings of others, while the immature tend to be more focused on their own needs than those of others.
1.11.1.1. Con: According to [research](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/25/opinion-polls-public-opinion-politicians), shifts in public opinion are very correlated with [age](http://www.ipsos-mori-generations.com/). As younger generation hold different values \(in most cases more tolerant and open-minded\), older politicians indeed lose touch with constituents.
1.11.1.2. Con: Despite the myths about young generations being more focused on themselves, most research points out that millennials prefer [brands](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/314156) that are socially responsible, care about the environment and are more [transparent](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahlandrum/2017/03/17/millennials-driving-brands-to-practice-socially-responsible-marketing/#10dee85f4990). Therefore as a generation, they do seem to care about their surroundings a lot.
1.12. Pro: Could create more diversity among members., especially women and minority groups.
1.12.1. Pro: Due to the tremendous power and privilege of those in office, once an elected official burrows in, it's nearly impossible to get them out.  Within a very short time of taking office they figure out the rules for staying in office.  They quickly assimilate into the ruling class becoming just one more voice in partisan group think.  Term limits may not eliminate partisan politics, but at a minimum it would introduce new voices into the conversation.
1.12.2. Pro: It reduces incumbents' advantages.
1.12.3. Con: According to [data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/05/08/no-term-limits-wont-draintheswamp-we-did-the-research/?utm_term=.8493b2d01ee2), limiting term limits would not "get rid of career politicians and replace them with citizen legislatures".
1.13. Con: It could take the power away from voters on the local level.
1.13.1. Pro: If an elected official has agreed to pass a specific bill they voters agree on, and he or she is replaced mid voting, that could produce results against the voters' interests.
1.13.2. Con: If the voters care enough about the issue they will vote in a new person that will continue to push it through
