Discussion Title: Should cosmetic surgery be banned?

1. Elective cosmetic surgery should be banned.
1.1. Pro: There are [concerns](https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/counselling/psychological-impact-of-cosmetic-surgery.htm) about the negative psychological impacts of cosmetic surgery.
1.1.1. Con: A [study](http://www.advancecosmetic.com/blog/psychological-impact-cosmetic-surgery) found that patients who underwent cosmetic surgery displayed more enjoyment in life and higher self-esteem, after their appearance had been physically altered.
1.1.2. Con: Concerns about potential psychological impacts should not be a reason to ban something, especially if the impact of it might actually be beneficial.
1.1.3. Pro: The urge to change one's body is often a symptom of a deeper underlying mental problem. Having the option to change one’s body at will means that the underlying issue is not addressed directly, and therefore not treated as a problem.
1.1.3.1. Pro: [A study](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/16/fashion/16sside2.html) published in Annals of Plastic Surgery found that among women with cosmetic breast implants, there was a threefold increase in suicide and in deaths related to alcohol or substance abuse compared with the expected death rates of women who did not have implants. The findings suggest that a sizable subset of women who have breast augmentation may have underlying psychological disorders.
1.1.3.2. Pro: [Researchers](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/02/15/mental-health-problems-worsen-after-cosmetic-surgery/) found that people who opted for cosmetic surgery had a history of mental health issues. Cosmetic surgery did not help solve these issues, but rather exacerbated them.
1.1.3.3. Pro: For many people, an exaggerated focus on appearance is very bad for self-esteem and neglects underlying emotions.
1.1.4. Pro: According to [research](http://www.advancecosmetic.com/blog/psychological-impact-cosmetic-surgery), 7 to 12 percent of cosmetic surgery patients are affected by Body Dysmorphic Disorder, an anxiety disorder that causes a person to have a distorted view of how they look and to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance.
1.1.5. Pro: There are [documented](http://www.advancecosmetic.com/blog/psychological-impact-cosmetic-surgery) negative psychological effects that may be experienced by patients who undergo cosmetic surgery during the recovery period, including "self-isolation, depression, anger and adjustment difficulties".
1.1.5.1. Con: These negative psychological effects are a result of surgical wounds, swelling and bruising during the recovery period and are therefore temporary until the patient sees the final result of their cosmetic procedure.
1.1.6. Con: A study found that [95%](http://docweinstein.com/can-cosmetic-surgery-improve-quality-life) of patients who underwent breast lift surgery reported both physical and psychological improvements after their procedure.
1.1.7. Con: A [study](http://docweinstein.com/can-cosmetic-surgery-improve-quality-life) found that patients who underwent facial plastic surgery felt significantly more satisfied with their appearance, and also felt less anxious and more independent.
1.1.7.1. Con: [It's a study](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7s4656k6) over 6 to 18 months of people receiving facial surgery to help with a specific condition. The results might not be applicable generally.
1.1.8. Pro: Results of cosmetic surgery may not always come out as desired or envisioned by the patient.
1.1.8.1. Pro: Most women who get breast implants have [at least one serious complication](https://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/health-info/teens-cosmetic-surgery/) within the first three years, including infection, hematomas and seromas, capsular contracture \(a sometimes painful hardening of the breasts\), loss of nipple sensation, and hypertrophic scarring.
1.1.8.2. Pro: According to [the chief of plastic surgery](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2011/06/16/hidden-dangers-of-cosmetic-surgery/#9e81a6b7b2bc) at University of California, changing one feature sometimes throws off the appearance of others. A tummy tuck may cause the thighs to look out of proportion, while plumped lips may make a normal sized nose suddenly appear obtrusive. This might lead to a patient having more cosmetic surgeries than originally intended.
1.1.8.3. Con: As long as the individual is fully informed by the surgeon about all the risks of the cosmetic surgery \(including not coming out as desired\), it ends up being a matter of choosing to continue with the procedure regardless of the risks or not. One of the ways it can be made sure that all the information is given by the doctor is by giving informed consent, which is already mandatory for all medical procedures in the EU.[\(Chapter II\)](https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168007cf98)
1.1.8.4. Pro: Liposuction may slim one problem area while [creating another](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/weekinreview/01kolata.html?_r=1&ref=health). Women who suction fat from their thighs and lower abdomen ultimately destroy those fat cells. When they eventually put weight back on, it distributes unevenly- often to less flattering areas like the upper abdomen, back and arms.
1.1.8.5. Con: Any undesired outcomes experienced by a patient as a result of cosmetic surgery can be corrected with further cosmetic surgery procedures.
1.1.8.5.1. Con: Given the fact that cosmetic surgery costs [thousands](http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/health/sc-cost-of-plastic-surgery-procedures-health-0503-20170413-story.html) of dollars, many people may not be able to afford any additional procedures.
1.1.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2. Pro: There are risks involved in having any surgery, and procedures that are purely cosmetic are not worth those risks.
1.2.1. Con: A national [study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141105165203.htm) found that minimally invasive cosmetic procedures are exceedingly safe and have essentially no risk of serious adverse events.
1.2.2. Pro: Cosmetic surgery violates the [Hippocratic oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath) because it carries a potential for harm without curing or preventing disease.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Calculating health risks can be difficult with aesthetic procedures. With most surgeries, the risks are weighed against expected health improvements. Aesthetic procedures, by definition, do not improve health.
1.2.3. Con: The risks associated with cosmetic surgery are [reduced](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cosmetic-surgery/about/pac-20385138) in healthy individuals with no history of cardiovascular disease, lung disease, diabetes or obesity.
1.2.4. Con: People have the ability to make that decision for themselves. For some people, the benefits of cosmetic surgery would outweigh the harms.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Due to the permanent \(or semi-permanent\) nature, cost and potential harms of cosmetic surgery, people do research on their own or ask questions from their surgeon before making a final decision.
1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.
1.2.6. Pro: There is a [risk](https://www.healthline.com/health/most-common-plastic-surgery-complications#1) of developing a hematoma during breast augmentation or facelift procedures.
1.2.7. Pro: Nerve damage is a serious [risk](https://www.healthline.com/health/most-common-plastic-surgery-complications#2) during breast augmentation procedures, with 15% of women permanently losing nipple sensation after receiving an implant.
1.2.8. Pro: [Infection](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cosmetic-surgery/about/pac-20385138) at the incision site may worsen scarring and even require additional surgery.
1.2.9. Pro: Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism \(as a result of blood clots\) can be potentially [lethal](https://www.healthline.com/health/most-common-plastic-surgery-complications#2).
1.2.9.1. Con: The incidence rates for blood clot related complications are [quite low](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19952670).
1.2.10. Pro: During healing, scarring and skin breakdown [can occur](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cosmetic-surgery/about/pac-20385138) that requires surgical intervention.
1.2.11. Pro: General anaesthesia typically required for cosmetic surgery can lead to [complications](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cosmetic-surgery/about/pac-20385138) such as lung infections, stroke, heart attacks, and even death.
1.2.12. Pro: Seroma \(fluid buildup under the skin\) is a common [complication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2827279/) after abdominoplasty \(tummy tuck\).
1.3. Con: Banning cosmetic surgery does not get rid of the demand for it, which leads to a rise in unregulated cosmetic surgery.
1.3.1. Pro: ["Do it yourself"](http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=8080723&page=1) cosmetic surgery is very dangerous and often leaves people with permanent damage to their health and appearance.
1.3.2. Pro: Black-market [butt injections](http://www.costhetics.com.au/news/warning/) are gaining popularity but can maim or kill recipients.
1.3.3. Pro: Black market cosmetic surgeons offer reduced prices and results that are too good to be true. This often [means](http://www.the-cosmetic-surgery-directory.com/article_bargain.html) unsafe doses, inferior quality products or dangerous substitute substances and unqualified practitioners administering the procedure.
1.3.3.1. Pro: People opting for [black market cosmetic surgery](http://www.the-cosmetic-surgery-directory.com/article_bargain.html) often have a distorted body image with unrealistic expectations of the procedures. Such people may have been refused treatment by licensed professionals and can be easily persuaded by the black market offers.
1.3.4. Con: Banning means that people who were on the fence about getting cosmetic surgery are discouraged from doing so, decreasing the amount of surgeries and by extension, the social norm of body modification.
1.3.4.1. Con: The reduction in quality, and increased risks of each individual surgery resulting from individuals resorting to the black market, outweigh a reduction in the total number of surgeries.
1.4. Con: In a society that places a lot of emphasis on looks, it is perfectly reasonable and understandable that people want to do what they can to improve their appearance.
1.4.1. Pro: There is a privilege associated with being conventionally attractive. People, with the means to do so, should have the ability to take advantage of that privilege because societal standards won't change in the near future.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Conventionally attractive people have the upper-hand in politics, according to [a study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004727270900142X) in Finland which found that both male and female political candidates who look better than their competitors are more successful. A better individual beauty score was associated with an increase of 20% in the number of votes for the average non-incumbent parliamentary candidate. Perceived competence and trustworthiness had less of an effect.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Conventionally attractive people are typically treated better by others. In [a study from Harvard University](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025656), researchers found that wearing makeup, shown to enhance a woman's attractiveness, boosted people's perceptions of that subject's competence, likability, attractiveness, and trustworthiness.
1.4.1.3. Pro: According to [research](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/01/05/new-study-finds-women-who-are-not-considered-attractive-receive-lower-grades?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed&utm_campaign=bba62ad46f-DNU20160105&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1fcbc04421-bba62ad46f-197603613) from two economists at the Metropolitan State University of Denver, women who are conventionally attractive have an advantage in college and earn higher grades than unattractive female students.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Conventionally attractive people often end up earning more money than their lesser attractive counterpart. Women with above average looks [reportedly](http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/12/17/people-who-were-pretty-in-high-school-make-more-money-because-life-isnt-fair/) make 8% more money while below-average looking women have a 4% penalization. While an attractive man earns just 4% more, men who fell below average on the looks scale lose 13%.
1.4.1.5. Con: Beauty standards do [change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminine_beauty_ideal) [with time](https://www.littlethings.com/beauty-through-the-ages/) and vary [between](http://social.diply.com/beauty-standards-across-world) [cultures](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-the-ideal-womans-body-looks-like-in-18-countries_us_55ccd2a6e4b064d5910ac3b0).
1.4.2. Pro: The appearance of a person, especially when we enter the digital age, is not a fixed. A person should have the right and the ability to \(safely\) change his/her appearance to something he/she can identify with. This technique will be more and more advanced in the future, and there will be safer and easier means to modify the appearance of a person. There should be limitations on what and how it is performed, but a total ban is not preferable.
1.4.3. Pro: Cosmetic surgery should not be banned because it improves the quality of relationships.
1.4.3.1. Con: The high cost of surgery can be financially burdensome, which can cause arguments and strain the relationship between couples.
1.4.3.2. Con: An improved appearance may result in more attention to the individual who has had cosmetic surgery. The partner may not be able to deal with the extra attention their other half is now receiving leading to feelings of jealousy which could be detrimental to the whole relationship.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Cosmetic surgery can improve sex life.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: According to a [study](http://www.plasticsurgeryportal.com/articles/plastic-surgery-improves-sex-life), individuals who had cosmetic surgery procedures such as breast augmentation, facial surgery and body contouring reported an improvement in their sex life.
1.4.3.4. Pro: Women may undergo cosmetic surgery to increase their perceived attractiveness as a means to retain their romantic partner. [A 2017 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5557785/) shows that women use appearance enhancement tactics as part of a broader strategy of Benefit-Provisioning mate retention to minimize the likelihood of partner infidelity. The results reveal a positive association between consideration of cosmetic surgery and performance frequencies of Benefit-Provisioning mate retention for women.
1.4.4. Pro: With social media websites, people now have 24-hour access to celebrities. High-profile social media personalities, such as Kylie Jenner, use a variety of apps to share their day-to-day lives, and also to showcase the cosmetic work they’ve undergone. This makes followers also want to attain this surgically-enhanced perfection.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Around 55 percent of facial plastic surgeons in a [survey](https://www.aafprs.org/media/stats_polls/m_stats.html) from the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery reported that patients said looking better in a selfie was their reason for getting surgery.
1.4.5. Pro: A study found that women who had certain cosmetic procedures were [perceived](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3032333/Having-plastic-surgery-make-LIKEABLE-Women-went-knife-rated-attractive-feminine-trustworthy.html) as having greater social skills, more attractive and trustworthy. Therefore, it is understandable that women may want cosmetic surgery to improve their appearance because it makes them more likable.
1.4.5.1. Con: To be completely relevant, the study should compare cosmetic procedures to other perception-influencing methods like well-applied makeup, and even subliminal behaviours used by perceived successful people to create a good impression.
1.4.5.2. Con: The pressure on women to change their looks is part of what makes society unequal.
1.4.6. Pro: In certain careers, such as acting, there is a particular pressure on women to remain looking young, and they should be allowed to access these procedures in order to continue getting jobs and roles.
1.4.6.1. Pro: 57 percent of facial plastic surgeons in a [survey](https://www.aafprs.org/media/stats_polls/m_stats.html) by The American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery  reported patients’ desire to stay relevant and competitive at work as a major driver in the decision to have a cosmetic treatment.
1.4.6.2. Pro: The situation is analogous to a problem with steroid use in sports. If one competitor is willing to do it to get an edge, other competitors must follow suit or fall behind.
1.4.7. Con: If people continually change their appearance, society as a whole will have less of an ability to move away from its focus on looks.
1.4.7.1. Con: A focus on looks is not necessarily a bad thing.
1.4.7.2. Con: Appearance is biologically significant. It is not clear that it will ever be possible for society to escape a focus on appearances.
1.4.7.2.1. Con: As appearance is biologically significant to signal functional properties of our bodies, feigning a look might lead to poor genetic expression and less opportunity: 1. to change the physical behaviour that shapes our bodies and 2. to express good abilities that are dormant because of poor environmental factors that might otherwise be changed.
1.4.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.2.
1.5. Pro: Allowing cosmetic surgery sends problematic messages about the need to change and improve your appearance to meet societal expectations.
1.5.1. Pro: Cosmetic surgery reinforces beauty standards by allowing people to literally buy into the dominant trends and apply them to their bodies.
1.5.2. Con: Those problematic expectations will exist anyway. Cosmetic surgery can lessen the harms of these societal expectations to those who can access it, by allowing them to gain comfort in their physical appearance, at least for a portion of their lives.
1.5.2.1. Con: While cosmetic surgery can be viewed as a solution in the short term, other methods like working on self-esteem and social intelligence can give us greater quality of life that changes our self-perception and/or makes appearances less relevant.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.5.3. Pro: Western beauty ideals dominate the narrow standard of beauty that cosmetic surgeries set. Popularization and easy accessibility of cosmetic procedures will lead to the homogenization of beauty, both in terms of physical features and ethnic differences.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Surgeries for minorities usually attempt to undo the physical features that denote race.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: The [majority](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/25/health/asian-beauty/index.html) of facial cosmetic operations performed on Asians are considered "Westernizing" procedures. Two of the most popular, nose jobs \(rhinoplasty\) and eyelid lifts \(blepharoplasty\), are specially designed to make these features look more Caucasian.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Women all over the world subscribe to these Western ideals of beauty- like [skin-whitening in India](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18268914) and [rhinoplasty in Iran](https://www.refinery29.com/2013/03/43802/iranian-plastic-surgery).
1.5.3.3. Con: Motivations for ethnic cosmetic procedures have changed in recent times. In the early days of cosmetic surgery immigrants underwent procedures to try to look “[more American](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/19/nyregion/19plastic.html)”. Now, however, many immigrants have procedures that reflect their home culture’s trends. Different nationalities choose cosmetic surgery that is tailored to their cultural preferences and ideals of beauty.
1.5.4. Pro: The growing commonality of plastic surgery promotes self-esteem issues among the young population and creates the illusion that cosmetic procedures are the only viable option to achieve their desired results.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Children who watch a parent or close relative take the drastic measure of surgery can develop [a skewed vision](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2011/06/16/hidden-dangers-of-cosmetic-surgery/#9e81a6b7b2bc) of their own bodies that they may never escape.
1.5.4.2. Pro: With plastic surgery becoming more common, parents are [more likely](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/fashion/15skin.html) to find themselves having to learn how to say no to a son or daughter with a tarnished self-image who is begging for the same quick surgical fix that the parents themselves may have had.
1.5.5. Pro: This reinforces our tendency to adapt to rather than work to change society. Conforming to beauty norms hinders the process of changing the norms to become more inclusive of a variety of natural appearances.
1.5.6. Pro: If a surgery is not medically necessary, or an attempt to fix an injury, but rather an attempt to "improve one's looks", then it is a form of lying about one's genetic traits.
1.5.7. Pro: Cosmetic surgery is [on the rise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2011/06/16/hidden-dangers-of-cosmetic-surgery/#437061517b2b), with 5% more procedures in 2010 than the year before, increasing the pressure of societal expectations.
1.5.8. Con: People who decide to have cosmetic surgery have shown to be reasonable in their expectations of how it will contribute to change in their lives. The majority of participants in a study who wanted to have cosmetic surgery done were found to express [realistic expectations](http://www.advancecosmetic.com/blog/psychological-impact-cosmetic-surgery) of what they hoped to achieve from the procedures, which included feeling better and developing more self-confidence.
1.5.8.1. Pro: The majority of the participants in the [study](http://www.advancecosmetic.com/blog/psychological-impact-cosmetic-surgery) were found to have achieved their desired goals and their expectations met, twelve months after they had their procedures done.
1.5.9. Pro: Many Chinese students are getting cosmetic surgery to get a competitive edge in [job interviews](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2090075/chinese-students-having-cosmetic-surgery-aid-job-interviews).
1.5.10. Pro: Cosmetic surgeries support and strengthen harmful social ideals regarding women’s bodies.
1.5.10.1. Con: Those ideals will continue to exist. Banning cosmetic surgery will only make life under those societal norms harder by limiting access to a method of conformation.
1.5.10.1.1. Pro: It will make it harder for those who need it than for those who don't, increasing the divide between those who are lucky enough to meet the societal norms naturally and those who aren't.
1.5.10.1.2. Con: Ideals have been changing for each generation, sometimes rapidly.
1.5.10.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.5.
1.5.10.2. Pro: Marketing of cosmetic procedures, usually targeted specifically to women, relies on and emphasizes the value and importance of appearance for women, often as a measure to increase sexual desirability to men. The procedures themselves \(face lifts, breast augmentation, liposuction\) reflect and confirm particular social ideals about the attractiveness in women of youth, slimness and big breasts.
1.5.10.2.1. Pro: The number of total cosmetic procedures performed yearly in [the USA](https://watermark.silverchair.com/sjv100.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAZ4wggGaBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGLMIIBhwIBADCCAYAGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMqMKLo5b4AHmPXkLJAgEQgIIBUSOAHo1rhwvZoanlqJ1SF5r5N3UPHFO59Xz8wJMTSltkzICBKjR92N9EMkTOCAAYauQ5fjk8SCxC6G7neUZCwmoQtLJdk8rhSV6hPQzLmkAuFine9MYJ1hOOJ5JULyAahXF9A5vnH7tDo1d9CpzVjosJRB-jylenmsTf6J2qyBe26WdgC23YYxj85XZcXa1-TRqlajZBHh_N-Bgg2JBtzTf70IXK2fpYIbLR7Kn9UFGvaiQAXPtdc6NJyheQrIpCytLssrTtMqpgZESHmyMyH3AXUdUEWJb4iC16gF8boQ5szWd6xRsa27Svgyj34G4Geu8bNZVJGdcn2Ij7eCdi8Za7pkaA2US8xnz9VshU6oWWgauAkh4mxbRCsPoVcxV7s3_LIz1bGdjqLExxrFrkS3gD2Pj-eeqLVlW2lwwXse-ETbbEhezzOLqx2WEDX6TK66s) increased by more than 274% between 1997 and 2014, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. The vast majority of plastic surgery procedures were targeted towards women.
1.5.10.3. Pro: Cosmetic surgeries promote commodification of women's bodies.
1.5.10.3.1. Pro: An increase in cosmetic surgeries has led to the [commodification of breasts](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141103082618.htm). The cosmetic surgery industry sells breast augmentations as aids to increase self-confidence, self-esteem and as fashion accessories. The ability to buy and sell breasts positions them as a marketable object similar to other fashion items for consumption. In this context, more women are thinking of their breasts as fashion/status objects which can be reshaped and changed at will.
1.6. Con: Banning cosmetic surgery will reduce the number of practising well qualified surgeons available to perform reconstructive and medically necessary procedures.
1.6.1. Con: Surgeons tend to specialize in their particular field. It is unlikely that cosmetic surgeons perform non-cosmetic surgeries.
1.6.2. Pro: Cosmetic surgeons have to do their more serious procedures in a hospital operating room \(liposuction, breast implants, breast reductions, etc\). The time allowed for the cosmetic procedures could delay some life-saving surgeries.
1.6.2.1. Con: Hospitals triage their resources. As such it is unlikely they would delay a life-saving procedure in favour of a cosmetic procedure.
1.7. Con: Cosmetic surgeries are a source of income for the hospitals.
1.7.1. Pro: Hospitals need those incomes in order to finance other more important services.
1.7.2. Con: Cosmetic surgeries often occur in specialized or private clinics. It is therefore unlikely that revenue will be redirected towards any other services.
1.7.2.1. Con: In the case of major surgeries like breast reduction or augmentation, liposuction etc., it has to be in a certified hospital. The surgeon can come from a private clinic and can get paid by the customer, but the operating room has to be rented for the appointment, thus getting money into the infrastructure.
1.8. Con: Cosmetic surgery can be important for the wellbeing of people who had injuries affecting their appearance. While not necessary for medical reasons, it may be necessary psychologically.
1.9. Con: The focus should not be on whether cosmetic surgery should be banned or not, but on the reasons behind choosing surgery.
1.10. Con: People have a right to bodily autonomy, which means they get to make their own choices about issues that directly concern their body, including surgery.
1.10.1. Pro: This is the same reason we allow people to get tattoos or piercings. We realize that people have a right to control what they do with their bodies as long as there are no direct third party harms.
1.10.1.1. Con: From the norms they set, to the way they specifically target young women, cosmetic surgeries have immense third party harms to society and banning them is a just violation of the right to bodily autonomy.
1.10.1.2. Pro: The state should not interfere with a person's decision on body image, as it is effectively not its role.
1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.10.3. Pro: Body modification can improve one's quality of life. It is important to feel comfortable in one's body, and adults can make their own decisions on how to achieve that. This is especially true for transgender people who need to alleviate body dysphoria.
1.10.3.1. Con: Surgery for transgender individuals would not be considered cosmetic surgery since the procedure would have a medical justification - treating the patients' gender dysphoria.
1.10.4. Pro: It is a personal, individual right to do to one's body what one wishes \(within the limits of law, i.e. suicide being illegal\). When you start restricting a person's right to their own person \(i.e. body\) that is tantamount to feudal serfdom or slavery.
1.10.5. Con: People are easily fooled and swayed by marketing and social pressures, and sometimes do not have the capacity to decide what is good for them. Therefore, their right to bodily autonomy should be restricted.
1.10.6. Con: This right doesn't exist if most people can't exercise it due to its cost.
1.10.7. Con: When driven by a desire to look better people may feel incentivised to expose themselves to unnecessary risks. It is the job of regulators to prevent easy access to risky procedures.
1.10.8. Con: People should be well-informed about the potential dangers of cosmetic surgery before being allowed to exercise their right to bodily autonomy.
1.10.8.1. Con: It is a legal requirement in most countries that before any surgical operation the patient reads and signs a consent form. The consent form [typically](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1791005/#__sec8title) informs patients of the discomforts, potential risks and expected benefits, side effects and specific complications related to the surgery.
1.10.8.1.1. Con: Even if people are aware of the risks, they are unlikely to weigh them up rationally, due to short term bias and difficulty conceptualizing specific medical harms.
1.10.8.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.10.8.3. Con: This is an argument for increasing awareness regarding the potential dangers of cosmetic surgery, not for banning the procedure.
1.11. Con: Other methods of enhancing one's appearance are widely accepted in our society.
1.11.1. Con: Cosmetic surgery is much more risky than most other methods of making yourself look better.
1.11.1.1. Con: Cosmetic surgery becomes riskier when unregulated. Exacerbating the harms of the current cosmetic surgery industry.
1.11.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.11.1.2. Con: Arguably, plastic surgery is riskier than cosmetic surgery as it involves more extensive interventions.

1.11.2. Pro: In [several cultures](https://medium.com/\@nitinbhatt/16-most-extreme-cultural-body-modifications-in-the-world-f996b311036d), a variety of [body modifications](https://www.ranker.com/list/tribal-body-modifications/jeffrichard) form part of accepted practice and contribute to the social status of the individuals.
1.11.2.1. Con: Many such cultural practices are now seen as dangerous and inhumane.
1.11.2.1.1. Pro: [Foot binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_binding) was prevalent among Chinese women but the practice carried serious health risks of infection and muscular atrophy.
1.11.3. Pro: Plastic surgery is an accepted procedure to repair a supposed fault in one's body. There is no real difference between that and allowing someone to enhance their appearance.
1.11.3.1. Pro: Any procedure to enhance appearance puts forth the idea that there is a baseline "normal" look to a human being that some are born with and others need to create via surgery.
1.11.4. Pro: Makeup aims to achieve a similar purpose to cosmetic surgery and is widely used and accepted.
1.11.4.1. Con: Makeup is non-invasive and poses very few risks.
1.11.4.1.1. Con: Many of the chemicals commonly used in cosmetics have been found to be associated with [health risks](https://www.curejoy.com/content/harmful-side-effects-of-makeup/) ranging from skin irritations and headaches all the way to infertility and carcinogenic effects.
1.11.4.1.2. Con: Health-related complaints about cosmetic products are at an [all-time high](http://time.com/4832688/makeup-shampoo-toxic/).
1.11.4.2. Con: Makeup is temporary and reversible, unlike surgery.
1.11.4.3. Pro: Minimally invasive aesthetic procedures such as Botox, dermal fillers and laser treatments achieve the same results as makeup.
1.12. Pro: Cosmetic surgery is accessed unequally, as it is very expensive, and therefore only the wealthy can afford to improve their appearances this way.
1.12.1. Con: Many medical procedures are cost prohibitive for those who aren't wealthy, yet we still allow such procedures to be performed.
1.12.1.1. Pro: It is better that some individuals are able to gain a benefit than none.
1.12.1.2. Con: The availability of medical procedures often has a clear positive health effect, while cosmetic surgery is more ambiguous.
1.12.2. Con: Patronage by wealthy early adopters is critical to innovations and cost reductions that make procedures more affordable and accessible.
1.12.3. Con: Cosmetic surgery should be made more accessible by reducing its price.
1.12.4. Con: Cosmetic surgery is not a necessity, but rather a luxury, and therefore it is only fair for people to have access to this service if they can afford to pay for it.
1.12.5. Pro: This gives the wealthy another competitive edge over other less fortunate individuals. This competitive edge also only gets worse as more people opt for cosmetic surgery.
1.13. Pro: People cannot consent to cosmetic surgery.
1.13.1. Pro: There is insufficient information available for consumers to make an informed choice.
1.13.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.
1.13.1.2. Pro: Cosmetic surgery is not always successful.
1.13.1.3. Con: -> See 1.10.8.1.
1.13.1.4. Pro: Current practices for obtaining informed consent to cosmetic procedures are an extremely limited means by which to demonstrate respect for patient autonomy. Beyond asking whether the patient is competent to a minimal legal standard, informed consent often focuses on the actions of the practitioner and does not consider the capacities of the patient to critically reflect on their choices and values within the relevant context and circumstances.
1.13.1.4.1. Con: Current practices for obtaining informed consent to cosmetic procedures are the same as any healthcare procedure. By that logic, people cannot make an informed decision or give consent to any healthcare procedure either.
1.13.1.5. Pro: It is impossible for patients to determine whether a successful procedure will actually make them feel better \(even if it does make them look better\).
1.13.2. Pro: The ability of an individual to decide whether to have cosmetic surgery can be compromised by their mental state.
1.13.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.13.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.13.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.13.3. Pro: It is unclear whether cosmetic surgery actually provides a benefit.
1.13.3.1. Pro: Cosmetic surgery has clear and detrimental harms.
1.13.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.
1.13.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.13.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.12.

1.13.3.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.
1.13.3.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
1.13.3.1.10. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.
1.13.3.2. Pro: The government does not allow people to engage in behaviors that are harmful and provide no benefit. E.g. not wearing a seat belt.
1.13.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.
1.13.4. Con: This standard of consent would mean people wouldn't be able to consent to any medical procedures. It's really hard to tell if most medical procedures will yield a benefit and no one can perfectly explain all information to a patient on the procedure.
1.13.4.1. Con: Surgical procedures must demonstrate a [benefit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4998723/) in excess of the Placebo effect. No such requirement exists for cosmetic procedures.
1.13.4.2. Con: Non-elective surgery is by definition beneficial since it is life-saving.
1.13.5. Pro: Cosmetic surgery does not meet the legal standard of [informed consent](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/finding-and-paying-for-treatment/understanding-financial-and-legal-matters/informed-consent/legal-requirements-of-consent.html).
1.13.5.1. Pro: For informed consent, the information given to the patient must be understood. There is a financial incentive not to tell the patient all the harms of the procedure because surgeons want to make money. Without internalizing all the harms and benefits, patients can never be fully informed.
1.13.5.2. Pro: Informed consent also assumes that when making the decision, the patient is not pressured. But with cosmetic surgery, most of the time the patient is getting the procedure because they were pressured by their family, society, etc.
1.13.6. Pro: There are extremely coercive forces that lead people to seek cosmetic surgery.
1.13.6.1. Pro: People often seek cosmetic surgery to better align with social norms of beauty.
1.13.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.
1.13.6.2. Pro: Minors pressured by society, peers, and even their family members are at an increased risk of getting [cosmetic surgery while too young](https://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/health-info/teens-cosmetic-surgery/), leading to lifelong medical problems.
1.13.6.2.1. Con: This is a reason to more strictly enforce regulations preventing minors from accessing cosmetic surgery, not an argument to ban cosmetic surgery altogether.
1.13.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.5.2.
1.13.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.11.2.
1.13.6.5. Con: Many similarly coercive forces drive people to wear makeup.
1.13.6.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.4.
1.13.7. Pro: -> See 1.13.6.2.
