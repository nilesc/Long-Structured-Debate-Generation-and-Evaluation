Discussion Title: Should food service workers be required to wear gloves?

1. Food service workers should not be required to wear gloves.
1.1. Pro: Wearing gloves can reduce hygienic discipline with workers.
1.1.1. Pro: Workers may not feel the need to wash their hands if they are required to wear gloves.
1.2. Pro: Wearing gloves gives the illusion that hands are clean when they might not be.
1.3. Pro: Consumers seeing gloves on the food service workers might imply an unclean workplace.
1.4. Con: Wearing gloves protects the consumer from potential pathogens on the worker's hands.
1.4.1. Pro: The [Center for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehs/News/Features/2013/JFP-articles.html)  \(CDC\) found that more than half of all food-borne illness outbreaks in the US stem from improper food handling.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Approximately [62%](http://blog.aarp.org/2013/12/19/cdc-many-food-workers-dont-wash-hands-and-worse/) of workers that handle beef with their bare hands do not wash their hands before touching other food.
1.4.2. Con: Pathogens can be present on gloves too, if the workers are not careful. Therefore, it isn't the best safeguard.
1.4.2.1. Pro: It is possible for workers to keep the same gloves on when handling food and other non-sanitary items, transferring pathogens present on their gloves to the food.
1.5. Con: It is easier to tell workers to wear gloves than to enforce proper hand-washing.
1.5.1. Pro: It is impossible to monitor the actions of workers in the restroom.
1.6. Con: Consumers seeing gloves on food service workers shows the facility cares about cleanliness and gives the consumer peace-of-mind.
1.7. Pro: Disposable gloves creates a significant amount of waste in the food service industry.
1.8. Pro: Supplying disposable gloves is an unnecessary cost for a restaurant or fast-food location.
1.8.1. Pro: A CDC study found that wearing gloves is [less sanitary](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehs/ehsnet/docs/jfp_food_worker_hand_hygiene.pdf) than when they don't because workers were less likely to wash their hands when they wore gloves.
1.9. Con: Abandoning glove use puts too much of a burden on food service workers.
