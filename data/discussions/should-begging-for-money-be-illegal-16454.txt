Discussion Title: Should begging for money be illegal?

1. Begging for money should be illegal.
1.1. Con: Unless behavior is threatening or disruptive, the bar for what is made illegal should be very high. It sets a precedent that minor inconveniences can/should be banned.
1.1.1. Pro: Begging, when not aggressive, doesn't pose harm to other members of society.
1.1.2. Pro: It is nobody’s business what people decide to do with their money or how other people get their money.
1.1.3. Pro: A government which is allowed to have unlimited authority results in a society which lacks freedom and recognizes few if any rights.
1.1.4. Pro: Begging is defined as the act of asking for charity and thus classifying this it as illegal would be violating free speech laws.
1.2. Con: Criminalizing begging could reinforce unfair stereotypes against beggars.
1.2.1. Pro: Criminalizing begging sends a message to society that beggars are criminals who do not deserve empathy or support.
1.2.1.1. Pro: The desire to criminalize begging is sometimes fueled by prejudice against groups that are perceived to be "more likely" to engage in begging.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: For example, support for a ban on begging in Norway appears to be [influenced](http://bora.uib.no/bitstream/handle/1956/15611/150425577.pdf?sequence=1) by negative stereotypes about the Roma.
1.2.2. Pro: Criminalizing begging will make it harder for convicted beggars to find work.
1.2.2.1. Pro: People with a criminal record find it [more difficult](https://www.fastcompany.com/40448610/its-hard-for-people-with-criminal-records-to-get-a-job-this-new-job-site-can-help) to secure employment than people with no criminal record.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Criminalizing begging reinforces the idea that beggars are "bad" or "immoral", meaning employers are less willing to give employment opportunities to former beggars.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Beggars who are in prison are unable to seek work or meaningfully build their CV.
1.2.3. Pro: Homeless or impoverished people who have harmed no one are regularly arrested for vague crimes such as "vagrancy," which in effect, [criminalize their very existence](https://www.feantsa.org/download/2015-02-07_draft_criminalisation_policy_statement-38703600034690521366.pdf). A ban on begging would likely function in similar ways.
1.2.3.1. Pro: A [2014 United Nations panel](https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/criminalization-of-homelessness-in-us-criticized-by-united-nations) criticized the U.S. for "the criminalization of homelessness through laws that prohibit activities such as loitering, camping, begging, and lying in public spaces.”
1.2.3.2. Pro: The [intention \(p.16\)](https://www.nlchp.org/documents/No_Safe_Place) behind criminalizing begging, in some instances, is to push poor people out of public spaces. Politicians then claim that the problem of begging has been "solved", when in reality, individuals who beg have just been pushed even further towards the margins of society.
1.2.4. Con: [Research](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3593074) shows that increasing public exposure to homeless people improves public attitudes towards that group. We can infer a similar effect for people who beg.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The [Contact Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_hypothesis) suggests that increasing contact between members of an "in-group" and an "out-group" improves relationships between the groups, by breaking down stereotypes and replacing these beliefs with first-hand personal experience.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: As listed in the Contact Hypothesis, "Contact fails to cure conflict when contact situations create anxiety for those who take part. "  Often begging creates anxiety on both sides.
1.2.4.2. Con: The contact time in a typical begging scenario is insufficient for beneficial interaction as per the [Contact Hypothesis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_hypothesis).
1.3. Pro: Banning begging would encourage beggars to find sustainable work.
1.3.1. Con: Data from Queensland indicates that criminalizing begging did [not reduce](http://www.lawright.org.au/_dbase_upl/Parity2017_The_Crime_of_Begging_Punishing_Poverty_in_Australia.pdf) the incidence of begging.
1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.3.3. Con: Some people who beg could not find work, even if they were forced to try.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Many jobs that pay a living wage require extensive education and qualifications.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: India has approximately [78,000](https://yourstory.com/2017/12/educated-beggars-street-hyderabad/) beggars who hold diplomas.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: India is currently in a [jobs crisis](https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/india-s-jobs-crisis-25-million-applicants-for-90-000-vacancies-1.718020). It is likely that most of those beggars, while qualified, are genuinely unable to find a job.
1.3.3.2. Pro: There is a stigma associated with homelessness which can make it difficult to find a job. Mental health problems, lack of education, a lacking social support system, and even just bad luck can lead to homelessness.
1.3.3.3. Pro: If someone is destitute, it is unlikely they will have professional attire appropriate for a job interview.
1.3.3.4. Pro: Many beggars are felons and cannot gain adequate employment as a result of their past incarceration.
1.3.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.3.4. Pro: The time that had previously been spent begging could be redirected to vocational education/training or applying for jobs.
1.3.4.1. Con: Many beggars are homeless; they do not have a permanent address which is required to apply for jobs and to receive social welfare benefits which would give them a means of living while attending vocational education and training courses.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: In the UK a [permanent address is not required](https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/homelessness/articles/get_practical_help_if_youre_on_the_streets/claiming_benefits_when_homeless) to receive welfare.
1.3.5. Con: If beggars are unable to meet their basic needs in life, they may be forced into crime because their desire to survive would outweigh respect for the laws of the land.
1.3.6. Pro: When people can receive money from begging, they have less incentive to seek out employment.
1.3.6.1. Con: Spending the day in the streets and begging is not a comfortable activity. Moving out of that situation is already a strong incentive.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: Just as some see owning their own business to be preferable to working for another, some people abhor the regular job market.
1.4. Con: Criminalizing begging would be very expensive to enforce.
1.4.1. Pro: There is an economic cost to enforcing criminal laws. Criminalizing begging would put people in the ward of the state, which at some point in time would create some expenditure on that person whether it be the cost board them in jail, court proceedings, or ticketing.
1.4.1.1. Pro: It would put them in the system and get them help so they don’t have to beg any longer.
1.4.2. Pro: The money spent on policing begging as crime could instead be spent on, for example, helping beggars gain employment or housing, removing the need for them to beg.
1.5. Con: Enforcing a ban against begging is likely to produce cruelty.
1.5.1. Pro: Images of the powerful imposing their will on the powerless rarely look good for the powerful.  If negative images surface, politicians will distance themselves from the policy.
1.5.2. Pro: If a person is starving and in order to survive they must break the law, then this statement makes a criminal of a starving person. Starvation should not be criminalized.
1.6. Pro: When people give money to beggars, they are not able to give it to other causes which can help people in need more effectively.
1.6.1. Pro: It remains unclear whether the most present beggars are the ones who are most in need of help. As a result it goes against the concept of effective altruism and can be seen as immoral.
1.6.1.1. Con: The possibility that the money is not allocated to the most in need beggars is an optimization issue rather than something which calls into question the morality of giving.
1.6.2. Con: People should be allowed to give their money directly based on their own conscience. To criminalize begging would take that right from the giver.
1.6.2.1. Pro: It is better for the potential donators to be the judge, not the government, as government intervention in such cases can quickly lead to a slippery slope of illegitimate intervention in other areas.
1.6.2.2. Pro: Begging is seeking aid and compassion, giving to beggars is effectively a free speech and religious rights issue.
1.6.3. Pro: Begging encourages people to act based on feelings and compassion, instead of acting by reason.
1.6.3.1. Pro: It may be more efficient to donate to charities that aim to get people off the streets, but giving change to a person on the street gives a more immediate sense of giving aid.
1.6.4. Con: It is not for anyone else to determine the value of an individual's donation to any cause.
1.7. Con: Begging is necessary for some people's survival.
1.7.1. Con: [Research](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/is-begging-just-a-scam-or-a-lifeline-for-those-most-in-need-a7371516.html) in England indicates that a large number of people who beg on the street do so to fund drug or other addictions, rather than to raise funds for necessities.
1.7.1.1. Pro: A [survey](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11681593/Police-survey-finds-just-one-in-10-beggars-are-homeless.html) conducted by the police in the UK city of Nottingham, found that just one in ten beggars in the city were homeless, and that 16 out of 52 of the individuals surveyed had posed as being destitute. This undermines the notion that beggars are forced to beg in order to survive.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: This survey refers to one city only. It would be wrong to make generalizations about all beggars from such a limited data set.
1.7.2. Con: It is not common for beggars to generate sufficient income to survive. Often, they rely on other resources to supplement their needs.
1.7.3. Con: The donator doesn't know whether the beggar can deal with money or whether he will purchase drugs.
1.7.4. Pro: People who need immediate help, e.g. cancer patients, can use begging in positive ways, especially if few healthcare safety nets exist.
1.7.4.1. Con: Begging is unlikely to raise sufficient funds to pay for an expensive healthcare treatment.
1.7.5. Pro: Crowdsourcing is a form of digital begging and has helped save lives. Look at the nearly 40 million raised by [JJ Watt](https://www.sbnation.com/2018/8/27/17786684/jj-watt-houston-hurricane-harvey-impact) for the city of Houston after Hurricane Harvey.
1.7.5.1. Pro: Additionally, some great startups have cracked the door open for innovation by leveraging crowdsourcing.
1.7.6. Pro: People affected by natural disaster like earthquake, famines, etc. are forced into begging for survival. An entire mass of population in the affected region relies on donations.
1.7.7. Pro: Begging is usually done because of a lack of money or a sustainable income that is linked to the way the capitalist system works and if there was a sustainable income ie a basic income then begging would no longer be needed.
1.7.8. Con: Begging is never necessary for survival. Food, water, shelter, and air are necessary for survival.
1.7.8.1. Pro: Organisations such as homeless shelters and soup kitchens exist so that people can survive without begging.
1.7.8.1.1. Con: There are not enough homeless shelters and soup kitchens to prevent people from begging.
1.7.8.1.1.1. Pro: In many nations, austerity has resulted in services for the most vulnerable being [cut](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/homeless-shelter-theresa-may-conservatives-beds-housing-statistics-rough-sleeping-a8303391.html). This has increased the numbers of beggars.
1.7.8.1.1.2. Pro: In 2017, [over a third](https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/homelessness-statistics/state-of-homelessness-report/) of homeless persons in the U.S. lived in places not meant for human habitation, such as parks, streets, and abandoned buildings.
1.7.8.1.1.3. Con: Making begging illegal may increase the number of organizations present to help the poor since now individuals know that the poor do not have begging to sustain themselves.
1.7.8.1.2. Con: Organizations that provide food and shelter cannot offer a sustainable income or long-term means of survival.
1.7.8.1.2.1. Pro: Organizations that provide food and shelter are not meant to provide for others on a permanent basis, nor should they.
1.7.8.1.2.2. Pro: Individuals need stability in their essential needs being fulfilled. Not having your hunger met and finding shelter for even one night is a horrendous experience. No one should have to go through that every day they can't find an organization with the resources to help them.
1.7.8.2. Con: Food, water, and shelter cost money in most places in the world. Begging is the only way some individuals can earn money, making it a stepping stone to their survival.
1.7.9. Pro: Beggars are [much more likely](http://www.lawright.org.au/_dbase_upl/Parity2017_The_Crime_of_Begging_Punishing_Poverty_in_Australia.pdf) than the general population to be: homeless, victims of domestic and family violence, poor, dependent on substances, mentally ill, and long term unemployed. If begging is criminalized, they will find it much harder to survive.
1.7.9.1. Con: Changing the legality of begging will not impact: their home, whether they are victims of violence, their financial status, their subtance abuse \(or lack thereof\), their mental stability, or their employment.
1.8. Pro: Begging on sidewalks and streets can be disruptive and pose safety issues for a city.
1.8.1. Pro: The influential [Broken Windows Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory) suggests that visible signs of civil disorder and anti-social behaviour may create an urban environment where further crime and disorder is more likely. As begging is a sign of social disorder, removing it from the streets will reduce crime overall.
1.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.
1.8.1.2. Con: As beggars still face poverty, beggars may be forced to resort to crime or other anti-social behaviour. This is worse for the surrounding community than begging.
1.8.1.2.1. Pro: Banning begging may force people, out of economic necessity, to engage in prostitution instead. If engaging in prostitution was a preferable option to begging, the beggars in question would have already opted for that, showing that prostitution, for many, is a worse option.
1.8.1.2.1.1. Pro: While also illegal in many places, prostitution is easier to engage in covertly than begging which is, by nature, done in public.
1.8.1.3. Con: The link between social disorder and crime is indirect and difficult to measure.
1.8.1.3.1. Pro: The increase of officers on foot patrol in Newark, NJ which increased residents' perceptions of social order and safety had [no discernable impact on crime rates](https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=81779).
1.8.2. Con: If not criminal this problem should not be taken as a complication for a city but rather for society. Creating a more inclusive and economically balanced society would diminish the safety problems individuals cause. Inclusiveness would arise from positive governmental actions.
1.8.3. Pro: Many states prohibit [aggressive begging;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggressive_panhandling) and making begging illegal would be a legitimate extension of that authority.
1.8.4. Pro: People who are begging can block access to local businesses, streets, or residences.
1.8.4.1. Con: Beggars have just as much of a right to use public spaces as any other citizen.
1.8.4.1.1. Pro: The [U.S. Supreme Court](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/evan-bernick/yes-the-first-amendment-p_b_9910602.html) has ruled that asking people for money is a protected form of free speech.
1.8.4.2. Con: Regulations can be implemented to avoid begging in areas \(such as entrances\) where accessibility might be severely impacted without having to make begging illegal.
1.8.4.3. Con: Many citizens are not allowed to [block common walkways](https://www1.nyc.gov/nycbusiness/article/sidewalk-usage-guide) in areas as they could become as much of a hazard.
1.8.4.4. Pro: [Surveys](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/banks-back-proposal-for-new-york-to-ban-begging-near-atms) indicate that people support banning panhandling near ATMs, because the presence of a person begging nearby makes them nervous about withdrawing money.
1.8.4.5. Pro: Tourists may avoid cities or areas known to be frequented by large numbers of people who are begging for [various reasons](https://www-jstor-org.tkc.idm.oclc.org/stable/3488102?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=begging&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3Fwc%3Don%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3BQuery%3Dbegging%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&refreqid=search%3A62fff2cb0b825fbb726764de816dbd1b&seq=4#page_scan_tab_contents)-- because they do not want to be reminded of social issues and poverty while on vacation or because they associate begging with crime.
1.8.4.5.1. Con: It is wrong to ban begging in tourist areas. Tourist areas are where beggars are most likely to access potential contributors.
1.8.4.5.2. Con: The needs of tourists fortunate enough to be able to afford to travel should not be prioritised above an area's residents who are unfortunate enough to have to beg.
1.8.4.5.2.1. Con: Oftentimes the residents of tourist areas rely on tourism as their source of income. Begging that harms tourism impacts those residents' livelihoods.
1.8.4.5.2.1.1. Con: People with jobs and businesses in the tourist industry are relatively better off than beggars. As such, the needs of beggars should be prioritised above those better off.
1.8.4.5.2.1.1.1. Con: If the whole community is losing income, more will lose jobs and opportunities creating more in the undesired poverty state.
1.8.5. Con: The beggars are at far more safety risk than anyone else they encounter on the streets, having to survive in a harsh environment without shelter and constant stress.
1.8.6. Pro: The sight of individuals begging can be distressing for citizens that encounter beggars.
1.8.6.1. Con: It is a good thing if the sight of a beggar makes people who encounter them feel discomfort. Witnessing human suffering should cause distress. The distress might motivate otherwise apathetic individuals to do something to reduce inequality in society.
1.8.6.1.1. Pro: People are less able to address a problem if they aren't clearly aware the problem exists.
1.8.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.5.
1.8.7. Con: Research into begging has consistently found that incidences of begging that are 'disruptive' and pose 'safety issues' are [much lower](http://www.lawright.org.au/_dbase_upl/Parity2017_The_Crime_of_Begging_Punishing_Poverty_in_Australia.pdf) than is reported in the media.
1.9. Con: It is not the place of governments to decide who can ask for help and who can be given it.
1.10. Con: If begging for money is illegal, then everyday actions we take right now would be illegal. This would create an economic collapse.
1.10.1. Pro: If begging for money is illegal, then people would not be able to get jobs \(jobs are a form of begging, which is an 'act of imploring others to give money'. When someone asks for a job, they are asking that person to have their company provide them money\).
1.10.1.1. Pro: Making job illegal would only make sense in a moneyless world.
1.10.1.2. Pro: If someone takes money from a job through begging, then that is less money for another person or the company.
1.10.1.3. Con: People could get money in other ways without begging via a job. They could find money on the ground, learn to save money \('a penny saved is a penny earned'\), make what usually costs money \(like growing food instead of buying it\), provide for others without asking for money \(like volunteering\) and possibly getting something in return if lucky...
1.10.1.3.1. Pro: Governments could implement programs like a UBI to provide people money. That way, people do not have to beg for money \(unless they are trying to get visas in order to get the UBI\).
1.10.1.4. Pro: Even [busking](http://www.wlrn.org/post/how-pandhandling-laws-are-bust-buskers-downtown-miami) \(a kind of job, as it is a performance for money\) is considered to be panhandling, because working can still be considered the equivalent to begging.
1.10.2. Pro: Companies would not be able to advertise and sell products \(as it's an 'act of imploring others to give money', i.e. people be customers and spend money on their products\), so companies could not exist. If they do, it would be only by giving products away for free.
1.10.2.1. Pro: Companies would not even be able to have investors too, because companies ask them for money to get their support. Without investors, even giving away products for free would be difficult.
1.10.2.2. Con: Companies could exist if the person who starts the free business also runs it.
1.10.2.3. Con: People could decide to give companies donations even though the company does not ask for them.
1.10.3. Pro: Governments would not be able to tax citizens, so they would have great difficulties in existing.
1.10.4. Pro: Non-profits and charities would not be able to get funds easily if they could not ask for donations. People would give anyway without organizations asking, but it would be more difficult than before to receive funds.
1.11. Pro: Begging can be exploitative.
1.11.1. Pro: Some beggars exploit the goodwill of people while not being [in need of financial help](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/beggar-who-earned-50000-a-year-and-lives-in-300000-fulham-flat-is-arrested-again-8646973.html).
1.11.1.1. Con: The fact that some individuals exploit a practice doesn't negate the fact that many individuals legitimately depend upon the practice for survival.
1.11.1.2. Con: Some individuals also commit welfare fraud to exploit a state's welfare system but such welfare systems are allowed to continue to exist.
1.11.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.1.
1.11.1.4. Pro: Begging should be used to cover basic needs, in fact a beggar should beg for food or a place to sleep. However, money may go to drug abuse or other purposes.
1.11.2. Con: Banning begging will not end exploitation of people who are forced to beg.
1.11.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.2.1.
1.11.2.2. Pro: Making begging illegal would not end child trafficking; it would only change what kind of labor the children were forced to do.
1.11.2.2.1. Con: The fact that human traffickers currently force children to beg as opposed to any other form of child labour indicates that begging is the most profitable form of child labour for human traffickers. Even if other forms of forced child labour persist, they will be less profitable and thereby reduce the incentive for the trafficking of children.
1.11.2.2.2. Con: If the children are not able to bring in money through begging, cartels will not have the profit incentive to traffic them.
1.11.2.2.2.1. Con: There would still be a profit incentive to traffic children for [sexual exploitation](http://www.heatwatch.org/human_trafficking/about_csec).
1.11.3. Pro: Children from around the world are trafficked and sent into [forced begging schemes](http://humantraffickingsearch.org/201788forced-begging/), in violation of their human rights and child labor laws.
1.11.3.1. Pro: In [Senegal](https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/03/19/exploitation-name-education/uneven-progress-ending-forced-child-begging-senegal), children are forced to beg under the guise of Quranic schools.
1.11.3.2. Con: -> See 1.11.2.2.
1.11.3.3. Pro: Studies have found that handicapped children bring in three times as much revenue as non-handicapped ones. This has lead to forced [mutilations and amputations](http://humantraffickingsearch.org/201788forced-begging/) – the cutting off of legs, or the removal of eyes – with the goal of rendering the children more profitable.
1.11.3.3.1. Pro: [Reported examples p.8](http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---ifp_skills/documents/publication/wcms_310228.pdf)  of this practice include but are not limited to: forced amputations of children limbs, deliberate blinding of children, and throwing acid onto a child.
1.11.3.4. Pro: As of 2016, [over 300,000 children in India](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-300000-children-across-india-are-forced-to-beg-by-cartels-report-2218856) were controlled by human trafficking cartels for forced begging.
1.11.3.5. Con: Forced begging is already illegal, under child labor laws. Banning begging outright would not necessarily stop the practice.
1.11.3.5.1. Con: It is easier to protect people from exploitation when all begging is banned, as opposed to having to inquire and investigate if a specific incident of begging is forced or exploitative.
1.11.3.6. Pro: Police have estimated that, in 2011, [160 children](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2826035/Child-exploitation-deeply-disturbing-story-Red-Ed-s-14-year-old-Roma-beggar.html) were trafficked into the UK from Romania by organised groups.
1.11.4. Pro: It's possible that beggars are themselves target of exploitation. People should not support activity that depends on exploitation.
1.11.4.1. Con: It is a duty of the law enforcement to track down the exploiters and protect rather than punish those being exploited.
1.11.5. Con: It is the choice of the passerby to decide if they want to share their fortune onto others. It is never required to give money to beggars. If a beggar is suspect of unacceptable actions by observation or though to a bystander, then it is still their choice to give or withhold their change.
1.11.6. Pro: Begging can be very profitable and tax free.
1.11.6.1. Pro: A study by The Department of Justice revealed a man in NY [making $200 an hour](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/do-panhandlers-make-50-an-hour/) with his dog.
1.11.7. Con: The capitalist system under which most of the world operates can be [exploitative](http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/hr/ppd/files/gdp-teach&learn_Sociology.pdf).
1.11.7.1. Pro: According to Marx's [labor theory of value](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/exploitation/#MarxTheoExpl), the commercial economy is inherently exploitative because it requires workers to sell their labor for less than the value which it produces.
1.11.7.1.1. Con: [Research](https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/S0161-723020170000032003) shows that in the 1990s and 2000s, there are countries where the labor theory of value indicates non-exploitative labor costs, and that the rate of exploitation in advanced countries is decreasing.
1.11.7.1.2. Con: Many economists have [criticised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticisms_of_the_labour_theory_of_value) Marx's labor theory of value.
1.11.7.2. Con: A truely free market capitalistic system cannot be exploitative as the workers will find others who will value their labor.
1.11.7.2.1. Con: A truly free market does not exist anywhere in the world. The version of capitalism present within the world has the tendency to be exploitative.
1.11.7.3. Pro: Many large modern corporations [maximize](https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/trade_environment/wheeling/hnike.html) their profits by setting up factories in third world countries where they take advantage of local labor by paying them a lot less than their labor is worth. Paying someone lower because they don't have a political voice and are too poor to consider quitting is exploitative.
1.11.7.3.1. Pro: In countries where unionization has increased, it has been [severely repressed](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/how-thatcher-smashed-unions) by the government therefore forcing people to pick between working on low wadges or not working at all and falling below the poverty line.
1.11.7.4. Pro: Chinese factories from which many consumer products come from are [known](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/04/the-grim-truth-of-chinese-factories-producing-the-wests-christmas-toys) to be notoriously exploitative.
1.11.7.5. Con: Even if a system is prone to being exploitative, there are varying degrees to which individual professions and acts operating within that system are exploitative; if begging is particularly exploitative then it should be banned.
1.11.8. Con: Exploitative begging should be banned. However, it does not follow from this, that all begging should be banned.
1.11.8.1. Con: -> See 1.11.3.5.1.
1.12. Con: If beggars are permitted to openly beg, it grants them visibility to government agencies and charities and allows them to receive targeted relief which they may not be able to seek out for themselves.
1.12.1. Con: Most long-term poverty relief programs do not occur through interactions on the street. These programs often require that a person comes to a resource center, which would be the case regardless of the legal status of begging.
1.12.2. Con: Beggars and those in poverty will still be visible in society, even if they cannot solicit money on the street.
1.12.2.1. Pro: Media outlets and advocacy groups will continue to bring attention to the plight of impoverished persons.
1.12.2.2. Con: If begging were to be illegal, it would give leverage to drive beggars away from places were they are visible.
1.12.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.12.4. Pro: Being begged helps ones to keep asking himself/herself about what he/she is doing to help his/her poorer fellow human beings. Forbidding beggars gives a collective legal answer instead of a moral and individual one,  therefore  fueling people to rationalize their selfishness.
1.12.5. Pro: Many people, including members of charitable organisations, are able to approach people they see begging to provide them with information about the services available to them.
1.12.5.1. Con: Charities could still approach people who come to receive services at formal shelters, soup kitchens, and resource centers.
1.12.6. Pro: Beggars might not have internet access to search for services available to them.
1.12.7. Pro: Information about government welfare programmes and charitable organisations can be difficult to find.
1.13. Con: Banning begging does not solve the problems that cause people to beg.
1.13.1. Pro: The [structural causes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306094400_SOCIO-ECONOMIC_CAUSES_OF_BEGGING) such as intergenerational poverty and caste systems cannot be effectively addressed by banning begging.
1.13.1.1. Pro: In the United Kingdom, strict implementation of [benefit sanctions](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/benefit-sanctions), has resulted in [more](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/30/begging-prosecutions-increase-england-wales) people begging in city centers.
1.13.2. Con: A ban on begging does not seek to solve the problems that cause people to beg, rather it seeks to solve the problems caused by begging. The forces which lead people to beg can be addressed by other means.
1.13.2.1. Pro: For instance, the criminalisation of murder does not seek to solve the problems that cause people to murder others. Rather it seeks to stop murders, which are bad in and of themselves.
1.13.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.2.
1.13.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.13.5. Pro: There are successful methods to solve the problem, for example the method that [Finland used to solve homelessness](https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2017/mar/22/finland-solved-homelessness-eu-crisis-housing-first).
1.13.5.1. Con: But that method is very expensive, and not all the countries can afford a similar solution.
1.13.6. Pro: A ban on begging wouldn't stop it if there are no alternatives to survive. The root cause is poverty and this should be solved first.
1.13.7. Pro: When all safety nets fail, governments do not allocate enough \(or any in some cases\) funding for mental health care, facilities etc, that is a collective failure and this is the result. To outlaw it would then reroute the resources that could be put into treatment, but instead put the money into law enforcement and incarceration.
1.13.8. Pro: It's possible to preempt most begging by offering sufficient social services, which is preferable to reducing begging by coercion.
1.13.8.1. Pro: Reducing begging through social services is morally preferable to reducing begging through criminalization.
1.13.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.
1.13.8.2. Pro: Social services would not necessarily be more expensive than the costs associated with processing beggars in the criminal justice system, and the outcomes are likely to be better.
1.13.9. Pro: Since banning begging does not solve the problems that cause beggars to beg, if begging is criminalized, many beggars will continue begging.
1.13.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.13.9.2. Pro: Since beggars will continue to beg, they will face needless hostility, arrest and punishment from law enforcement.
1.13.9.2.1. Pro: Beggars who are fined as punishment for begging are rarely in a position to pay those fines. As a result, they are plunged into a vicious cycle of debt and poverty. [\(p. 33\)](http://www.lawright.org.au/_dbase_upl/Parity2017_The_Crime_of_Begging_Punishing_Poverty_in_Australia.pdf)
1.13.9.2.1.1. Pro: Fining beggars can result in some beggars accumulating high levels of debt. This can result in serious problems.
1.13.9.2.1.1.1. Pro: For example, in some municipalities in Belgium, beggars with high levels of debt have been deemed ineligible for social housing.
1.13.9.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Being ineligible for social housing compounds a beggar's problems as, in addition to the obvious problem of having a lack of shelter, not having a fixed address often makes them ineligible to apply for jobs and other welfare schemes.
1.13.9.3. Pro: To avoid detection by the police, beggars will move to areas with less police presence - thus placing themselves at greater risk of harm.
1.13.9.3.1. Pro: The poor and disenfranchised are especially vulnerable to hate crimes and attacks. Over a period of 15 years, the [National Coalition for the Homeless](http://nationalhomeless.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hate-Crimes-2013-FINAL.pdf) documented nearly 1,500 acts of violence against homeless persons, causing 375 deaths.
1.14. Pro: It is illegitimate to ask for money without doing something in return.
1.14.1. Con: Anyone requesting money in exchange for goods and/or services would, inadvertently, become part of the Informal Employment Economic[¹](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/informal-economy.html) Sector[²](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/informal-sector.html) upon doing so, and the reimbursement would be considered Black Money[³](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/black-money.html)... which would make the otherwise 'grey area' exchange illegal.
1.14.1.1. Con: Small transactions like payment for minor services can be classified as a verbal contract and are perfectly legal.
1.14.1.1.1. Con: Anyone who engages in a business or trade to earn his or her livelihood or a profit, and has not created a corporation to do so, is considered to be self-employed. [¹](https://employment.findlaw.com/wages-and-benefits/self-employment-taxes-q-a.html) You have to file an income tax return if your net earnings from self-employment were $400 or more. [²](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/self-employed-individuals-tax-center) -- That being considered, if the people requesting money do not follow the legal and judicial requirements, as a direct result for trading services in exchange for money, it should \(and is\) an illegal practice.
1.14.2. Con: When they find themselves in the situation of begging, it's often because they have nothing to give or do in return.
1.14.2.1. Pro: When one has valuable assets, it is more efficient to use them in a regular paid job, rather than discount them for begging money.
1.14.3. Con: Beggars do not just 'take' money from individuals who donate, they enable donors to perform an act of charity, from which donors derive happiness and satisfaction.
1.14.4. Con: It is not illegitimate to ask for money without doing something in return because the potential donator can always choose not to give any money. If someone gives money to a beggar, it is voluntary and therefore legitimate.
1.14.5. Con: It's not always illegitimate to ask for money without doing something in return.  Perhaps the person being asked for money has no need of anything from the person doing the begging, who may be working as hard as she can to help others are in need.  In such a case "doing something in return" would be counterproductive.
1.14.6. Con: The Salvation Army is begging, and so are churches, and so are nonprofit organizations that are able to afford marketing campaigns.  If we allow them, it would be inconsistent to prohibit a lone individual from doing similar things.
1.14.7. Con: Many entites ask for money without providing any goods or services in return.
1.14.7.1. Pro: Birthday gifts, wedding registries, and other forms of generosity are based on the idea of giving something without receiving anything in return.
1.14.7.2. Pro: Non-profits, including charities and some religious organizations, fundraise and ask for money from donors; and typically [certify](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/charitable-contributions-written-acknowledgments) that the money was received without being in exchange for anything.
1.14.7.2.1. Con: Non-profits and charities are required to have a specific goal or mission. Donations to the non-profit are seen as an exchange of money toward furthering the community.
1.14.8. Con: -> See 1.6.2.
1.14.9. Pro: The majority of people in society work for what they have; it is unfair of beggars to ask that these people sacrifice those gains for the beggars' benefit.
1.14.9.1. Con: People are not forced to make any sacrifices. They can freely choose whether or not to give to a person who is begging.
1.14.9.2. Con: Begging has strong links with [poverty](https://tribune.com.pk/story/249099/social-ills-poverty-driving-people-to-beggary/), and poverty is often [generational](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/craig-and-marc-kielburger/poverty-inherited_b_7663842.html). Beggars are not at fault for not being born into a better situation.
1.15. Con: When governments fail to uphold their duty in protecting their citizens from extreme poverty, it is wrong to punish these failed citizens by banning begging.
1.15.1. Pro: Beggars often use the cash obtained by begging, to access basic services that the state should have provided them with in the first place. Punishing beggars for this, is immoral.
1.15.1.1. Pro: For example, in some regions, beggars [need to pay cash](https://www.feantsa.org/download/2015-02-07_draft_criminalisation_policy_statement-38703600034690521366.pdf)  to use emergency shelters \(p. 5\).
1.15.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.15.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.
1.15.4. Pro: For many people, begging is the only legal way to get money. Banning begging would unnecessarily make these people criminals.
1.15.5. Pro: People who are beggars tend to be homeless, and for a reason. Various circumstantial and mental health issues are at play. Criminalising begging only makes them more vulnerable. It is, in essence, placing a penalty on destitution
1.15.6. Con: Nations should not be responsible for their citizens fiscal health.
1.15.6.1. Con: -> See 1.14.9.2.
1.15.6.2. Pro: The [social contract](https://legaldictionary.net/social-contract-theory/) that typifies government does not include any premise to its constituents' financial health.
1.15.6.2.1. Con: The social contract has evolved since Rousseau.  It now includes protecting people from the harms that flow from capitalism, including impoverishment.
1.15.6.2.2. Con: The first and greatest harm in the original U.S. social contract was the protection of slavery as an institution.  The 13th amendment changed that.
1.15.6.2.3. Con: The US social contract expanded to include the basic financial well being of its citizens with the passage of [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/history/briefhistory3.html) under Franklin D. Roosevelt.
1.15.6.2.4. Con: The US social contract expanded to include access to health care with the advent of [Medicare](https://www.nasi.org/learn/medicare/history) in 1965.
1.15.6.3. Pro: A non-dictatorial or oligarchial government is intended to enhance the security of all of its citizens, not provide for a small sample group of them.
1.15.6.3.1. Con: When security is reduced it would generally mean the government has an interest in reducing death or physical harm in some way, whether it be from the natural world or other humans. Not only does poverty threaten the security of the impoverished, but having large enough sections of the population extremely impoverished threatens the security of the non impoverished by making it more likely that class based violence or an oppressive police state will occur.
1.15.6.4. Con: The entire idea of a nation is built on collective betterment. It is the responsibility of a nation to ensure that its citizens get at least a bare minimum of resources. If even that is not provided, the state is failing in its duty.
1.15.6.4.1. Pro: Human beings don't live as individuals but rather in organized social setups called nations because they've evolved over time to ascribe to the notion that governance is something that is necessary. Since good governance better serves to help everyone within a nation-state, it seems logical to assume that nations exist for collective betterment since specializing in various professions and fields helps mankind as a whole.
1.15.6.4.2. Con: Not all nations exist for the betterment of their people. Some states are inherently oppressive e.g. Dictatorships and therefore cannot exist under the same umbrella.
1.15.6.4.2.1. Con: Even if such states exist, such principles are still anti-humanitarian and the states are failing in their duty. This failure cannot be condoned.
1.15.6.4.3. Con: There is no consensus on whether states are meant to provide for the basic needs of citizens unable to provide for themselves.
1.15.7. Pro: The state owes a paternal duty to provide for its citizens.
1.15.7.1. Con: It is difficult to put a monetary figure on when the state can be deemed to have fulfilled its obligations towards any particular individual.
1.15.7.1.1. Con: [Poverty thresholds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_threshold) do just that. If a person is living below the poverty thresholds and cannot meet their basic needs, then the government should intervene.
1.15.7.2. Pro: The state and its citizens have an ongoing monetary relationship. The state taxes citizens and as such should provide monetary aid to them where necessary.
1.15.7.2.1. Con: One of the major sources of revenue of most states is income tax, which those who engage in begging, for the most part, do not pay.
1.15.7.2.1.1. Con: States do not treat people equally on the basis of how much tax they pay. If that were to be the case, then everyone who is not in fit working condition and those who pay less tax than others would be treated unequally.
1.15.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: State laws apply equally to individuals regardless of their economic background. Rich people are sentenced to punishment just as the poor are.
1.15.7.2.1.1.2. Pro: In contract law there is equality between parties and no one party has more rights than another unless they have done something to warrant additional rights. Economic fairness exists in the eyes of the state so that everyone can trade on the same level.
1.15.7.2.1.2. Con: People who beg still pay taxes in the form of VAT for the goods they buy with the money they earn begging.
1.15.8. Pro: If begging is criminalized, people who beg will be at risk of being put in prison or fined. This is morally wrong.
1.15.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.15.8.2. Pro: A fear of being arrested or fined may deter many beggars from seeking support from charities or state run services.
1.15.8.3. Pro: Fining beggars places further hardship upon members of society that already experience severe disadvantage.
1.15.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.9.2.1.
1.15.8.4. Pro: If begging is criminalized, a fear of being arrested and punished will deter beggars from reporting crimes which are committed against them.
1.15.8.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.9.3.1.
1.16. Pro: Begging discourages the government from implementing more efficient social welfare programs.
1.16.1. Pro: People often [turn a blind eye](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/22/social-experiment-shows-hundreds-ignoring-homeless-boy-in-new-zealand) to beggars on the street. That, in turn, gives the government an excuse to turn a blind eye to their needs.
1.16.2. Con: Social welfare programs help to reduce the amount of beggars. So it encourages the government to implement them.
1.16.3. Pro: Begging reduces the number of people living solely off social welfare, as beggars have a secondary source of income.
1.16.3.1. Con: This is not a bad thing.  If beggars forgo benefits because of their outside income there is more money for everybody else.
1.16.3.2. Con: Many people only resort to begging [after their social assistance benefits](https://www-jstor-org.tkc.idm.oclc.org/stable/3488102?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=begging&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3Fwc%3Don%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3BQuery%3Dbegging%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&refreqid=search%3A62fff2cb0b825fbb726764de816dbd1b&seq=11#page_scan_tab_contents) have been used up \(p. 559\).
1.16.4. Con: Begging can give an indication of the amount of people living in extreme poverty, making a community more willing to invest in reducing poverty.
1.16.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.6.1.1.
1.16.5. Con: Governments are embarrassed by begging, and sometimes this spurs them to fund outreach programs.  It's counterintuitive to think they would cut back on programs in response to begging.
1.16.6. Pro: If people often give in response to begging on the street, compassion fatigue may erode their political will for other charitable efforts.
1.16.6.1. Pro: People may feel that their charitable duty has been exercised through the giving of alms to beggars.
1.16.6.2. Con: Being generous makes people feel [happier](http://time.com/4857777/generosity-happiness-brain/); when people notice themselves feeling good after giving money to beggars, they might become more generous in order to keep feeling happier.
1.16.6.2.1. Con: Most people who see beggars do not donate to them. Instead, they become [desensitized](http://www.aconsciousrethink.com) and indifferent to their presence, and simply walk past and ignore them.
1.16.6.2.2. Con: While giving a small amount to someone personally may affect that person's life, more often a greater effect can be had by donating a larger amount to a group that aids those in need.  The smaller personal donation may cause the donor to not make the larger donation.
1.16.6.2.2.1. Con: Many people never make large donations to charity because, to them, the large donation is a lot of money that they feel they could put to use in their own life. In contrast to this, giving small amounts of money to beggars would appear to have a much smaller opportunity cost to people. It is better to have people give even small amounts of money by way of charity to beggars than to never give money charitably at all.
1.16.6.2.3. Con: If a person is confronted with begging while they are unable to be generous, they may feel saddened or angry at the beggar.
1.16.6.2.4. Con: A multitude of beggars would likely cause a rise in [apathy](https://shmaltzandmenudo.wordpress.com/2018/01/06/famous-sayings-95-familiarity-breeds-contempt/) rather than sympathy.
