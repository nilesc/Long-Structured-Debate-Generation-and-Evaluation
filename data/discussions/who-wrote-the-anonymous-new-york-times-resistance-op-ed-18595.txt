Discussion Title: Who Wrote The Anonymous New York Times Resistance Op-Ed?

1. Who Wrote The Anonymous New York Times Resistance Op-Ed?
1.1. Vice-President Mike Pence.
1.1.1. Con: Linguistic similarities \(like the use of “lodestar”\) to speeches authored by Pence could be diliberate misdirection on the part of the real author.
1.1.1.1. Pro: It’s likely that the real author would use such misdirection if they were familiar with linguistic forensic analysis, as Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats may be.
1.1.2. Con: The article says "whose job would be jeopardized by its disclosure," and the Vice-President cannot be fired by the President, meaning it's unlikely his job would be in jeopardy.
1.1.2.1. Con: Pence’s position as Vice-President would technically be jeopardized if he was forced into the role of President following an impeachment of Trump, which seems more likely after the publishing of this op-ed.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: A person's job is not "at risk" or "in jeopardy" because they are up for a promotion. It is extremely unlikely the the New York Times would use such an uncommon interpretation of that common phrase.
1.1.3. Pro: A [statistical analysis by Wikileaks](https://www.newsweek.com/who-wrote-anonymous-nyt-op-ed-about-trump-wikileaks-shares-likely-traits-1111246) suggest the author is most likely male \(66-87%\), older \(58%\) and Conservative \(92%\).
1.1.4. Con: Pence has stated that he'd be willing to take a [lie-detector test](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-lie-detector-test_us_5b951cfae4b0cf7b0040cc60) to prove that he didn't write it, a step further than others.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Expressing willingness to take a polygraph when asked by a journalist is not of itself informative, as it would cause immediate suspicion if a senior administration official were to say no. However, Pence did so with certainty and without hesitation, which perhaps counts for something.
1.1.4.2. Con: Given that lie-detector tests are quite [unreliable](http://www.apa.org/research/action/polygraph.aspx), Pence's stated willingness is a good way to deflect attention without any real risks.
1.1.5. Pro: Given that Mike Pence would become president of the United States if Trump was impeached, he has a clear motive.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Pence [intended](https://www.bustle.com/articles/187838-why-didnt-mike-pence-run-for-president-he-considered-it-at-one-point) to run in the 2016 Republican primaries, but Indiana’s election legislation prevented it. Being President is one of Pence’s ambitions.
1.1.6. Con: Pence has [denied](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/06/politics/trump-officials-denials-nyt-op-ed/index.html) that he wrote the Op-Ed.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Pence's denials in an [interview with Fox news](https://youtu.be/edH2kTFBOps) were strong, he vigorously advocated for Trump, and he also refuted the assertions of both Woodward and the Op-ed author that the white house is anything other than professional and effective. Were he to be subsequently outed as the author, his political career would be over as he would have completely lost all credibility.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: Pence could also receive social praise \([like Mark Felt](http://sonyclassics.com/markfelt/)\) if he was outed as a man who called out an allegedly [dangerous and dysfunctional](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/04/politics/bob-woodward-book-donald-trump-fear/index.html) administration.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Con: Praise for undermining the Trump administration would likely not come from the groups Pence most respects and identifies with.
1.1.6.1.1.2. Con: The op-ed writer themselves specifically refuted the allegations that the Trump administration was dangerous and dysfunctional, explicitly saying it had "[made America safer and more prosperous"](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html).
1.1.6.1.1.2.1. Con: Any administration that has "senior" people actively undermining some of its goals cannot be considered "functional."
1.1.6.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Every administration throughout history and in all countries has likely had "senior" people undermining some of its goals. Therefore the definition of "functional" given in the parent claim is ludicrous.
1.1.6.1.1.2.2. Con: By trying to undermine some of the Trump administration's goals, the author must believe that *some* of the administration's goals/policies are dangerous for the country.
1.1.6.1.1.2.2.1. Con: The author seems to believe that their work has protected the country from the administration's more "dangerous" inclinations.
1.1.6.1.1.2.2.2. Con: If the author believed that they would have said that. But they didn't. They in fact said the exact opposite of that.
1.1.6.2. Con: Given that Trump has demanded the author be [handed over to the authorities](https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2018/09/05/the-latest-trump-calls-anonymous-ny-times-op-ed-gutless), denying writing the article could just be self-preservation as opposed to honesty.
1.1.6.3. Con: The entire point of writing the Op-Ed anonymously was to avoid taking credit for it.
1.1.6.4. Con: He, like anyone else, has the ability to lie.
1.1.7. Pro: The article uses the uncommon word "lodestar," which Mike Pence has used [relatively frequently](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45431300) over the years.
1.1.7.1. Con: White House staffers have openly discussed how they phrase their leaks using their colleagues' [phrasings and idioms](https://www.axios.com/trump-white-house-leakers-leak-about-leaking-dae05b8e-e792-41a7-bb74-c2756b542cd0.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=twsocialshare&utm_campaign=organic) to throw the scent off of themselves.
1.1.8. Pro: A forensic linguistic analysis conducted by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45435813) concluded that Pence was the most likely author.
1.1.8.1. Pro: The writing style is likely to be Pence's because the editor of the NYT Op-Ed section has stated he did not edit the piece in order to ensure the piece truly reflected the author's intentions
1.1.8.2. Con: Someone could have observed and imitated Pence's writing style to attract attention to Pence and away from the real author.
1.1.9. Pro: It is possible that the article is the first step in a [25th Amendment](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/09/06/john-avlon-25th-amendment-new-york-times-op-ed-reality-check-newday-vpx.cnn) process to remove President Trump and install Pence as president.
1.2. White House Counsel Don McGahn.
1.2.1. Pro: Don McGahn [plans to leave](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/29/don-mcgahn-white-house-counsel-planned-departure/1130838002/) shortly after the Kavanaugh hearings, meaning he has little to lose.
1.2.1.1. Con: The fact that the President has already announced his upcoming departure means the New York Times is less likely to accept his request for anonymity.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: A person who has already announced his intention to leave his job would not be at risk of being fired.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: It is possible that the New York Times' decision to allow anonymity isn’t solely based on their source keeping their job.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: The possibility of any number of senior officials writing the op-ed creates more intrigue than naming the source.
1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The New York Times has more journalistic integrity than to grant anonymity solely to drive traffic.
1.2.1.1.2.1.2. Con: A member of a presidential administration openly talking about subverting the president would be just as a big a story.
1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.2.3. Con: McGahn has [denied](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/list-senior-trump-administration-officials-who-deny-writing-ny-times-n907106) that he wrote the Op-Ed.
1.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.
1.2.4. Pro: He has already shown his desire to circumvent Trump for the greater good by sitting with special counsel Robert Mueller's team for more than [thirty hours](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/us/politics/don-mcgahn-mueller-investigation.html) to aid their investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
1.3. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.
1.3.1. Con: Coats has never publicly criticized Trump, except for the Putin incident.
1.3.2. Pro: He was listed as one of 13 possible authors of the Op-Ed, stating among other points, "Coats has also shown a tendency to veer from the Trump songbook." [Trump Mystery Op-Ed \@ cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/05/politics/donald-trump-mystery-op-ed/index.html)
1.3.2.1. Pro: Due to his age and his proximity to retirement, he has less career risk than others.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Coates has [expressed](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/02/politics/dni-coats-trump-putin-helsinki-meeting/index.html?) his disagreement with the handling of the Helsinki meeting with Putin.
1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.3.4. Pro: The higher sense of duty expressed by the author\(s\) suggests that they have a long history of civil service in government.
1.3.5. Pro: The author conveys a higher sense of duty to the nation, suggesting that they may have previously served in the armed forces.
1.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.
1.3.6. Pro: The op-ed [notes](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2018/09/06/whodunit-rounding-few-suspects-case-new-york-times/DNcXpxXa0cHSoten99DksJ/story.html) that Trump has shown a preference for Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, while “the rest of the administration is operating on another track, one where countries like Russia are called out for meddling and punished accordingly.” Dan Coats was notably [appalled](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/us/politics/dan-coats-trump-russia.html) at Trump's stance on Putin.
1.3.7. Con: Coats has [denied](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/06/politics/trump-officials-denials-nyt-op-ed/index.html) that he wrote the Op-Ed.
1.3.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.3.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.
1.3.7.3. Con: Mark Felt, the original Deep Throat, always denied being the Nixon White House leak of Watergate information to Bob Woodward. Ignore denials.
1.4. Elaine Chao, Secretary of Transportation and wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
1.4.1. Pro: Michael Caputo, former Trump campaign advisor, [believes he knows](https://trumptube.tv/donald-trump-rally-speech-video/video/caputo-names-nyt-op-ed-is-a-she-9-8-18/) who 'she' is, and that she is tied to a high level person in “another branch of the government.” Chao fits this description.
1.4.2. Pro: A statistical analysis of word usage [suggests](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/09/anonymous-nyt-op-ed.html) Chao is one of the most likely authors.
1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.
1.5. Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General
1.5.1. Pro: The NYT [claims that](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/us/politics/rod-rosenstein-wear-wire-25th-amendment.html) Rosenstein offered to secretly tape President Donald Trump inside the Oval Office and wanted to “recruit” top administration officials to oust the president with a vote among Cabinet leaders. This is consistent with the use of the 25th Amendment claims in the op-ed.
1.5.1.1. Con: Rosenstein provided the [following quote to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/us/politics/rod-rosenstein-wear-wire-25th-amendment.html), disputing the account: "The New York Times’s story is inaccurate and factually incorrect,” he said in a statement. “I will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda. But let me be clear about this: Based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.”
1.5.1.2. Con: According to the [NYT story](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/us/politics/rod-rosenstein-wear-wire-25th-amendment.html), a further person who wouldn't give permission for their name to be used said Rosenstein made the comment about wearing a wire sarcastically, but this is disputed by others.
1.5.1.3. Con: It is unclear what the motivations are of the anonymous people who have made these allegations, and no way of determining their credibility or holding them to account.
1.5.2. Pro: Rosenstein is a long time [Republican, originally appointed by GW Bush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Rosenstein), which is consistent with the op-ed's criticism of trump for having "little affinity for ideals long espoused by conservatives"
1.5.3. Pro: There are credible allegations that Rosenstein was part of an attempt by the DOJ and FBI during the Obama administration to [attempt to prevent Trump from being elected and then remove him from office](https://dailycaller.com/2018/09/10/strzok-media-leak-text/)
1.5.3.1. Con: Rosenstein was [appointed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Rosenstein#U.S._Attorney) U.S. Attorney by George W. Bush, retained by Obama, and appointed Deputy Attorney General by Trump. It is not clear that he is secretly working to advance the political agenda of the "Obama DOJ."
1.5.3.2. Pro: Rosenstein [signed the controversial FISA warrant renewal](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/feb/2/rod-rosenstein-deputy-g-feels-heat-fisa-memo-backl/) that enabled the FBI to spy on a US citizen associated with the Trump campaign.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: The FISA judge was not specifically told that Steele had made [salacious and unverified](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295) allegations, for example about the existence of [Moscow Trump pee tapes,](https://www.thecut.com/2018/04/donald-trump-pee-tape.html) which may have significantly damaged Steele's credibility in the FISA judge's eyes.
1.5.3.2.2. Pro: The FISA judge was not specifically told that the Clinton campaign itself together with the DNC were the ones [who had paid for](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/once-more-for-good-measure-conservatives-didnt-fund-the-steele-dossier) the creation of the dossier. By specifically withholding certain pieces of information, the Judge was not able to assess all the relevant information in context to determine whether the criteria for granting a FISA warrant were met.
1.5.3.2.3. Pro: When Rosenstein signed off on the FISA, he did not tell the judge about [Steele's interrogatory responses](https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2018/08/declassified_did_rosenstein_make_false_statements_to_the_fisa_judge.html) in which Steele himself cast doubt on the veracity of the dossier.
1.5.3.2.4. Pro: The judge renewing the FISA application was not told that Steele had been [fired as an FBI source](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/02/fisa-memo-steele-fired-as-fbi-source-for-breaking-cardinal-rule-leaking-to-media.html) for lying to the FBI about leaking stories to the press that were then dishonestly used as independent corroboration of the dossier. Furthermore, Steele remained secretly in touch with the FBI through his [inside man Bruce Ohr](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/08/28/doj-official-bruce-ohr-faces-closed-door-grilling-over-trump-dossier-steele-ties.html).
1.5.3.2.4.1. Con: Leaking to the media in no way undermines Steele's credibility as a source. If the information you tell the FBI and the media is true, it is still the truth.
1.5.3.2.4.1.1. Con: Lying to the FBI about leaking to the media and going back on his word not to leak absolutely undermines Steele's credibility. So much so that the FBI fired him as a source. Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus
1.5.3.2.4.1.2. Con: The stories he leaked to the media were then [used in the FISA renewals as independent evidence](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/mar/4/christopher-steele-russia-dossier-writer-same-sour/) of the dossier being true, which is of course completely false as Steele was the only source for both. This undermines the credibility of both Steele and the FBI investigation.
1.5.3.3. Pro: Rosenstein appointed a special counsel with [extraordinarily broad remit](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39961732) to investigate Trump
1.5.3.4. Pro: The special counsel appointed by Rosenstein had a pre-existing '[nasty' relationship](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-29/giuliani-says-witnesses-contradict-cohen-story-on-russia-meeting) with Trump.
1.5.3.4.1. Con: The only relationship Trump could be referring to is when Mueller [cancelled](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-what-trump-got-wrong-his-attacks-mueller-n895821) a membership with a Trump golf course. This is hardly a serious conflict of interest.
1.5.3.4.1.1. Con: It is the [alleged animus around the cancellation](https://www.newsweek.com/mueller-quit-trump-golf-club-792562) not the cancellation itself Trump is referring to.
1.5.3.4.2. Con: Robert Mueller is [Republican](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-what-trump-got-wrong-his-attacks-mueller-n895821), meaning that party affiliation alone would not be a reason for animus towards Trump.
1.5.3.4.2.1. Con: Plenty of establishment Republicans [are anti-Trump](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Trump_movement)
1.5.3.4.3. Con: It is not clear whether Rosenstein was aware of this relationship.
1.5.3.5. Pro: Given that, years later, there has still not been a single indictment relating to collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, it increasingly appears that the investigation was politically motivated.
1.5.3.5.1. Con: The multiple investigations into [Benghazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigation_into_the_2012_Benghazi_attack) took significantly longer and ended with no indictments. The [Ken Starr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Starr)investigation took 4 years. If something is worth investigating, the time shouldn't matter.
1.5.3.6. Con: The same FBI under Obama has also been [credibly accused](https://www.timesofisrael.com/fbi-is-trumpland-and-agents-are-leaking-to-harm-clinton-report-claims/) of throwing the election towards Donald Trump.
1.5.4. Pro: The Attorney General is a member of the Cabinet, and so it is reasonable to call his Deputy a "senior official in the Trump administration."
1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.5.6. Con: Based on his [opening statement to the Senate on Comey being fired](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/read-rosensteins-full-opening-statement-comey-congress), Rosenstein comes across as a straight shooter willing to publicly call out wrongdoing. This suggests he may be less likely to hide behind anonymity when expressing his views.
1.6. Ryan Zinke, Secretary of the Interior
1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.
1.6.3. Pro: The author, when listing their values, stresses the economic benefits of a Trump presidency. This suggests they have a past in the business world.
1.6.4. Con: As a product of the military - and the Navy Seals at that - Zinke may be particularly averse to the kind of insubordination that this op-ed represents.
1.6.5. Con: The op-ed seems focused somewhat on foreign affairs. Zinke's background does not suggest an abiding interest in foreign affairs.
1.7. It was co-authored by a group of non-cabinet officials, but senior government officials who identify as traditional Republicans.
1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.
1.7.2. Pro: The article is heavy with 2nd person plural pronouns.
1.8. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly
1.8.1. Pro: Kelly may have wrote the Op-Ed because he is finding it too difficult to control and manage Donald Trump.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Kelly, according to several [media reports](http://uk.businessinsider.com/roger-stone-says-a-clash-between-trump-and-john-kelly-was-inevitable-2017-9), has sought to limit access to Trump, supplement his media diet with more reputable news sources, and regulate his use of social media.
1.8.1.2. Pro: According to a [media report](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/04/politics/woodward-trump-book/index.html), John Kelly spends most of his time keeping Trump in the dark for the "good of the country." Such a reason for doing so serves as a strong motivation for him to have written the Op-Ed.
1.8.1.3. Pro: Trump [prefers](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6006859/Trump-really-doesnt-want-chief-staff-John-Kelly-spends-mornings-sweating-gym.html) to watch cable news and make announcements and condemnations via Twitter, while Kelly rarely watches TV and is not on the social media site.
1.8.1.4. Pro: While Kelly has axed the ['meeting crashers'](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6006859/Trump-really-doesnt-want-chief-staff-John-Kelly-spends-mornings-sweating-gym.html) - those aides who show up to meetings uninvited - he has not been able to stop Trump from adding or subtracting staff to the gatherings as he wishes.
1.8.1.5. Con: Kelly has successfully managed to convince Trump to get rid of Presidential staff from the White House.
1.8.1.5.1. Pro: Kelly [removed](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6006859/Trump-really-doesnt-want-chief-staff-John-Kelly-spends-mornings-sweating-gym.html) Anthony Scaramucci as communications director, just ten days after Scaramucci took on the position.
1.8.1.5.2. Pro: Kelly [ousted](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6006859/Trump-really-doesnt-want-chief-staff-John-Kelly-spends-mornings-sweating-gym.html) Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon.
1.8.1.5.3. Pro: Former presidential aide Omarosa Manigault was [fired](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/12/politics/omarosa-manigault-newman-john-kelly/index.html) by John Kelly.
1.8.2. Con: John Kelly expressed that he has an "[incredibly candid and strong relationship](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1037107565413511168)" with Donald Trump, removing any incentive for him to have written the Op-Ed.
1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.
1.8.5. Con: John Kelly stated in an interview that he serves Trump out of a [‘sense of duty’](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/05/11/john-kelly-confirms-it-he-serves-trump-out-of-a-sense-of-duty/?utm_term=.65d5e2ac2e4c).
1.8.6. Pro: John Kelly wrote the Op-Ed in order to save himself from being fired as Chief of Staff by Trump.
1.8.6.1. Pro: It is alleged that some of Trump's friends and advisers believe he does not want a [Chief of Staff](https://www.politico.eu/article/how-john-kelly-became-donald-trumps-chief-in-name-only/), but this does not appear consistent with Trump's public support of John Kelly.
1.9. UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.
1.9.1. Con: The New York Times tweeted out the Op-Ed using the word "he," implying the author is not a woman.
1.9.1.1. Con: The New York Times [retracted](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/05/politics/donald-trump-mystery-op-ed/index.html) the tweet, saying "the tweet was drafted by someone who is not aware of the author's identity, including the gender, so the use of 'he' was an error."
1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.9.3. Con: Nikki Haley has [denied](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/06/politics/trump-officials-denials-nyt-op-ed/index.html) that she wrote the Op-Ed.
1.9.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.9.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.
1.9.4. Pro: The article refers specifically to examples relating to Foreign Policy, which is Haley's domain as Ambassador to the UN.
1.9.4.1. Pro: Specifically, the article mentions how the administration has been tough on Russia, and Haley has been one of few senior Trump officials to be [openly critical of Russia](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-putin-russia-will-never-be-friend-us-nikki-haley-1038694).
1.9.4.2. Con: The comments on foreign policy were hardly in-depth and could have been made by anyone with rudimentary knowledge of the Trump foreign policy.
1.9.5. Pro: Nikki Haley has publicly [rebuked](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/with-all-due-respect-i-dont-get-confused-nikki-haley-says-of-russia-sanctions/) an official in the administration, something few other Trump officials have done.
1.9.5.1. Con: That Haley has publicly rebuked a White House official shows a willingness to cross them on the record as opposed to simply behind the veil of anonymity.
1.9.5.1.1. Con: Haley's rebuke was in response to a challenge to her competence, not a criticism of Trump himself.
1.9.6. Pro: There has been informed speculation that Nikki Haley has [presidential aspirations](http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/383923-nikki-haley-hits-harder-emerges-stronger-for-oval-office-run).
1.9.6.1. Con: If Haley were acting on the basis of her presidential aspirations, authoring this op-ed would be unwise, as the risks from crossing Trump outweigh any benefit the op-ed may yield.
1.9.6.1.1. Pro: At 46, Haley is comparatively young and can afford to wait until [2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley).
1.9.6.1.2. Pro: Given that Trump remains quite [popular](https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx) with the Republican base, any Republican who is as hostile to Trump will face severe difficulties in Republican primaries.
1.9.6.1.2.1. Pro: Otherwise extremely conservative Mark Sanford [lost his primary](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/live-updates/midterms/live-primary-election-results/rep-mark-sanford-predicts-hell-primary-to-pro-trump-challenger/?utm_term=.a3ba53d51bbc) mainly because he criticized Donald Trump.
1.9.6.1.2.2. Pro: Many Republican candidates will go to [extreme lengths](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/07/31/ron_desantis_goes_all_in_with_trump_endorsement_in_florida_governor_race.html) to show their support for President Trump.
1.9.6.2. Pro: If the public views President Trump as a danger to the country, it would be easier for a Republican to challenge Trump in a hypothetical 2020 primary.
1.9.7. Con: Haley published an [Op-Ed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/when-i-challenge-the-president-i-do-it-directly-my-anonymous-colleague-should-have-too/2018/09/07/d453eaf6-b2ae-11e8-9a6a-565d92a3585d_story.html?utm_term=.15f122c6e9ad) in the Washington Post saying that when she disagrees with the President, she does so openly, and calling on the anonymous author to resign.
1.9.7.1. Con: Haley has since decided to resign.
1.10. Ivanka Trump
1.10.1. Pro: Ivanka's disagreement with her father's immigration policy, particularly family [separation](https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/ivanka-trump-disagrees-with-us-president-donald-trump-here-is-why/1267987/) of illegal migrants, may have given Ivanka a strong incentive to have written the Op-Ed.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Ivanka described Trump's [“zero tolerance”](https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/ivanka-trump-disagrees-with-us-president-donald-trump-here-is-why/1267987/) immigration policy - which led to the separation of parents from their children - as a "low point" for the administration. Therefore, Ivanka may have written the Op-Ed in order to preserve the moral integrity of America by having Trump removed from office.
1.10.1.2. Pro: The [rise](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-hate-groups/u-s-hate-groups-proliferate-in-trumps-first-year-watchdog-says-idUSKCN1G5286) in hate groups due to Trump's immigration stance could foster or encourage behavior that puts young children from migrant families in danger, a reality that Ivanka has [publicly stated](https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/ivanka-trump-disagrees-with-us-president-donald-trump-here-is-why/1267987/) she is against.
1.10.1.3. Pro: Ivanka has publicly [stated](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ivanka-trump-media-enemy-people-vehemently-family-separation/story?id=56986732) that she is "very vehemently against family separation and the separation of parents and children.”
1.10.2. Pro: Ivanka may have written the Op-Ed due to receiving plenty of blow back as a result of her father's actions, which may well be too much for her to cope with or tolerate any longer.
1.10.2.1. Pro: Ivanka expressed that she did not like being called an ["accomplice"](https://www.bustle.com/p/german-media-called-ivanka-trump-accomplice-to-her-father-shes-not-happy-about-it-53549) to her father by the German media. This suggests that she does not want to be held accountable for her father's actions that have been unfavorably received by the mainstream media.
1.10.2.2. Pro: Ivanka has stated that she is struggling to keep a "[work-life balance](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ivanka-trump-media-enemy-people-vehemently-family-separation/story?id=56986732)" since joining the White House.
1.10.2.3. Pro: Donald Trump's presidency has negatively impacted Ivanka's interests as a businesswoman.
1.10.2.3.1. Pro: The negative press around Trump's presidency has contributed to Ivanka having to [shut down](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/24/ivanka-trump-company-shut-down-close-nordstrom-line-poor-performance) her fashion brand. This suggests that Ivanka may have wrote the Op-Ed because her father's actions are now affecting her interests as a businesswoman.
1.10.2.3.2. Pro: Ivanka stated in an interview that she used to be praised as a female entrepreneur. However after her father declared his candidacy, she is now viewed [very cynically as opportunistic](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/us/politics/ivanka-trump.html).
1.11. Jared Kushner
1.11.1. Pro: The resistance towards Trumps presidency is largely attributed to the Left wing of the political spectrum. Jared has been a [lifelong Democrat](https://medium.com/\@yishan/jared-kushner-wrote-the-anonymous-nyt-op-ed-and-heres-why-f931bdd6f6cb) which makes him a potential suspect for having written the Op-Ed.
1.11.2. Pro: Jared’s NYC social circle [excommunicated](https://medium.com/\@yishan/jared-kushner-wrote-the-anonymous-nyt-op-ed-and-heres-why-f931bdd6f6cb) him when his role in Trump’s campaign became widely-known. Having Trump removed can serve as a way to improve his image, and potentially reingratiate him back into his social circle.
1.11.3. Pro: Although numerous top administration officials have denied being behind the article, Kushner has not publicly [denied](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/did-jared-kushner-write-anonymous-ny-times-op-ed-1112872%3famp=1) that he wrote the Op-Ed when asked by reporters.
1.11.4. Con: The op-ed author appears to have affinity with "ideals long espoused by Republicans." This is inconsistent with Kushner, a [life-long Democrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Kushner) until Trump ran for office.
1.11.5. Con: If Kushner was outed as publicly undermining Trump, the fallout could destroy his family and ruin his marriage. It is almost inconceivable that he would take such a big risk for so little gain.
1.12. An individual who is lower in the administration than “senior official” suggests.
1.12.1. Pro: The source indicates that there are others working with them, although the most senior government officials have denied complicity.
1.12.2. Con: The NYT would not have published the Op Ed w/out the confidential attribution of a senior official. It is unlikely the official is junior.
1.12.2.1. Con: Even the New York Times [admits](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/us/politics/senior-administration-official-trump-new-york-times.html) it is unclear just how senior someone needs to be to be called a 'senior administration official' by the New York Times.
1.12.3. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.1.
1.12.4. Pro: James R. Fitzgerald, [former FBI forensic linguistics specialist, who helped catch the Unabomber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSB6T9RJe6o), suggests that the op-ed author may be a lower-level, non-appointee.
1.12.4.1. Con: Having the appearance of multiple authors could be the result of a deliberate attempt at subterfuge, for example with select phrases being co-opted from other people's writings or parts being re-written by the NYT itself.
1.12.5. Pro: Trump NSC Staffer Matt Pottinger
1.12.5.1. Pro: Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon was [quoted](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/30/donald-trump-matthew-pottinger-asia-218551) saying that Pottinger is “one of the most significant people in the entire U.S. government.” which would support the idea that he has the ability to undermine Trump's rash actions as the article claims.
1.12.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.
1.12.5.3. Pro: The New York Times have previously described Pottinger as a “[senior official](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Pottinger#Political_career)” when he has given background briefings.
1.12.5.4. Pro: His previous experience as a [journalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Pottinger#Journalistic_career) would make it easier for him to secure an anonymous op-ed than other potential sources.
1.12.5.4.1. Con: There does not appear to be any difficulty with members of the administration talking to journalists, given the [number of leaks](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/391430-leaks-plague-trump-white-house-with-no-end-in-sight) and books citing administration officials as sources.
1.12.5.4.1.1. Con: Acting as a source is not equal to writing an opinionated editorial. One is part of journalistic research the other is a form of journalistic expression.
1.12.5.4.2. Pro: Pottinger would be familiar with the processes involved in getting a story like this published.
1.12.5.4.3. Pro: His reputation in journalistic circles would have helped in convincing the New York Times to publish his op-ed.
1.12.6. Pro: A group of administrative support personnel.
1.12.6.1. Pro: They would have access to the distinctive writing styles of administration officials.
1.12.6.2. Pro: Administrative support personnel would have access to the documents mentioned.
1.12.6.3. Pro: The ability to conceal or cover for each other \(which may have been increased when the Trump administration shuffled admin personnel very heavily at the outset of this term\).
1.12.7. Pro: As the details in the piece are quite vague, the author would not have needed the niche knowledge of a senior official to write it.
1.12.8. Pro: There is at least [one author](https://spectator.org/anonymous-ye-shall-know-him-by-his-fruits/?utm_source=American+Spectator+Emails&utm_campaign=16911b2420-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_09_10_08_13&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_797a38d487-16911b2420-104283193) who points out the phrasing and style in the article are more similar to someone who is much younger than someone who is of the average age of the current senior Trump officials.
1.12.8.1. Con: Any ghost writer could have been used to re-write the original statement to evade detection, including a junior NYT journalist.
1.12.8.1.1. Pro: It's possible the article itself was written by a speechwriter/staff member at the direction of a senior staff member.
1.13. United States Secretary of Defense James Mattis
1.13.1. Con: It would ruin Mattis's military legacy and irrevocably damage his honour if he was found to be carrying out acts that could appear seditious and directly undermine his Commander in Chief.
1.13.1.1. Con: It may not seem dishonorable to Mattis to help preserve the prestige of the position of Commander in Chief, a position Trump has [actively mocked](https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/newsvideos/president-trump-mocks-being-presidential/vp-BBK5KuE), especially when Mattis appears to disagree with [many Trump policies](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/31/trump-mattis-at-odds-on-key-issues-like-putin.html).
1.13.1.1.1. Con: The [cited example](https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/newsvideos/president-trump-mocks-being-presidential/vp-BBK5KuE) does not show Trump "actively mocking" the position of Commander in Chief, but rather making a funny joke about how 'being presidential' is often used to refer to acting stiff and formal. Given he hasn't actively mocked the position of CiC, it does not follow that Mattis would feel any need to preserve the prestige of the position.
1.13.1.1.2. Con: Mattis makes clear in [the article cited above](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/31/trump-mattis-at-odds-on-key-issues-like-putin.html) that any intimation that he and Trump don't see eye to eye is a work of 'fiction'. Therefore it would be even more dishonourable of him if he was pretending to agree with Trump publicly while secretly undermining him with acts that appear seditious.
1.13.1.2. Con: History has seen many people risk their career for what they perceive as the greater good.
1.13.1.2.1. Pro: George Washington fought in a risky rebellion against the English in pursuit of his personal ideals. He risked his career and legacy through this.
1.13.1.2.2. Pro: Robert E. Lee fought in a risky rebellion against the Union in pursuit of his personal ideals. He besmirched his career and legacy through this.
1.13.1.2.2.1. Con: There is [evidence to suggest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_memorials_to_Robert_E._Lee) that many people still respect and revere Lee’s legacy.
1.13.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Many of the people who still revere Lee's legacy subscribe to the [Lost Cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy) movement, which views "the American Civil War as an honorable struggle for the Southern way of life, while minimizing or denying the central role of slavery." The people who revere Lee's legacy either do not have an accurate knowledge of history or actively seek to minimize his role in attempted to preserve slavery.
1.13.1.2.3. Pro: Donald J Trump risked his legacy as a popular TV show personality and property mogul to enter the political fray because he considered the country [would be better off for it](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2016).
1.13.1.2.3.1. Con: Insofar as Trump has not [divested](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2017/01/11/donald-trump-will-hand-over-business/) his assets, it is difficult to construe his political involvement as being motivated by a willingness to risk his status as a property mogul.
1.13.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Trump seems to be [profiting](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2018-03-05/how-is-donald-trump-profiting-from-the-presidency-let-us-count-the-ways) tremendously from his presidency.
1.13.1.2.3.2. Con: The benefits and longevity of success in the political sphere is so much higher than any that can be derived from a reputation as a TV presenter that one need not resort to a "greater good" explanation to explain it.
1.13.1.2.3.2.1. Con: The potential benefits and longevity of success are matched only by the potential drawbacks and longevity of failure and demonisation. Having not previously been subject to extreme political [demonisation](http://www.telegram.com/article/20170618/BLOGS/306189792), running for President was an enormous risk that would not rationally be undertaken unless one thought the country would benefit and thus deliver personal benefits and longevity of success.
1.13.1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: Trump has been demonized by his political opponents as a [fascist](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/04/why-you-should-stop-calling-donald-trump-a-fascist/?utm_term=.e4482b42b3f6), a [Nazi](https://www.outkickthecoverage.com/espn-hires-keith-olbermann-regularly-called-donald-trump-nazi-twitter/), [evil](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/06/19/kirsten-gillibrand-interview-trump-religion-2020-218830), [stupid, senile, mentally ill](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/trump-cog-decline/548759/), [racist](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/08/14/times-president-trump-comments-called-racist/985438002/), [sexist](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-attacks-kirsten-gillibrand-twitter-after-she-calls-him-resign-n828701), [anti-Semitic, Holocaust denier](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/anne-frank-center-donald-trump-anti-semitism-holocause-denial-jews-racism-israel-ivanka-community-a7593696.html), [a dictator](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/adam-schiff-speech-video-house-donald-trump-authoritarianism-putin-democracy-a8445061.html), [the most deplorable, despicable human being](https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/09/13/maxine-waters-unloads-on-trump-the-most-deplorable-despicable-human-being/), and [treasonous](https://nypost.com/2018/08/19/brennan-doubles-down-on-trump-treason-comment/)... to name as few of the polite ones. These smears all represent a risk to his legacy that would not have arisen had he not entered the political fray.
1.13.1.2.3.3. Con: Nothing in his behavior indicates any risk on his part on behalf of the country - rather it indicates him seeing an opportunity to take the biggest stage in the world and subvert it to his own self-indulgent personal agenda.
1.13.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.13.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.
1.13.4. Pro: The op-ed was focused on foreign affairs, which is in Mattis's wheelhouse.
1.13.5. Pro: James Mattis had a close [relationship](http://time.com/5197834/trumps-defense-secretary-loses-an-ally-with-tillerson-firing/) with Rex Tillerson, who was removed from his position.
1.13.6. Pro: Mattis famously said, "[You cannot allow any of your people to avoid the brutal facts. If they start living in a dream world, it’s going to be bad](https://apholt.com/2016/12/04/marine-general-james-mattis-the-warrior-monk/)." He may feel as though Trump is ignoring brutal facts.
1.13.7. Pro: With Mattis being [put in the spotlight](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/09/mattis-woodward-trump/569350/) by Woodward’s recent book, it would make sense for him to anonymously inform people of the inner workings of the White House to justify his comments in the book.
1.13.7.1. Con: Mattis has [strongly denied Woodward's claims](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jim-mattis-i-didnt-say-the-contemptuous-words-about-trump-included-in-woodward-book), and to be going secretly to journalists to say the opposite at the same time would simply increase the chance of him being outed and looking foolish.
1.14. White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Chris Liddell
1.14.1. Pro: Liddell is the former CFO of GM, among other high level business roles. He is independently wealthy and not dependent on a future political career. [nbr.co.nz](https://www.nbr.co.nz/article/nzs-chris-liddell-reveals-extent-romney-role-and-refuses-join-doom-merchants-ck-132139)
1.14.2. Pro: Liddell was the transition team leader for Romney's presidential bid in 2012. Romney has been critical of Trump on similar points to those raised in the op-ed. Liddell wrote a book about the planned Romney transition.
1.14.3. Pro: Liddell is from New Zealand. His background is in global business. He has been CFO of GM, Microsoft, International Paper and WMG-IMG. His background in consistent with the pro-business, pro-global viewpoints in the op-ed.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Liddell)
1.14.4. Pro: Liddell has spoken on the record about West Wing chaos. [politico.com](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/03/trump-foreign-policy-chris-liddell-692613)
1.14.5. Pro: As Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, Liddell is squarely in the middle of the action on West Wing dysfunction. He was described in Axios as preferring to fly under the radar. [axios.com](https://www.axios.com/trumps-replacement-for-gary-cohn-1753daca-5edd-469d-87e3-8d4e987a6fc5.html). He is probably senior enough to be called a "Senior White House Official" and his office is in the West Wing \(not EOB\).
1.14.6. Pro: Mr. Liddell is among the few high-ranking WH staff who have not denied writing the op-ed.
1.14.7. Pro: Liddell was mentioned, then passed over, for chief economic advisor position in March. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/us/politics/christopher-liddell-trump.html) and [axios.com](https://www.axios.com/trumps-replacement-for-gary-cohn-1753daca-5edd-469d-87e3-8d4e987a6fc5.html)
1.14.8. Con: Mr. Liddell has been described as a "quiet, serious man" by Axios. By writing the op-ed, he would have risked putting himself in the spotlight. [axios.com](https://www.axios.com/white-house-keep-lose-job-thrive-keys-rules-92fcd2ee-367b-4f1e-84f8-2e2b6c306239.html)
1.14.9. Pro: Liddell is a member of the Council of Foreign Relations. [cfr.org](https://www.cfr.org/membership/membership-roster-a-f?letter=L)
1.14.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.15. A former member of the administration \(at the time of the op-ed\).
1.15.1. Pro: Former White House Director of Media Affairs Helen Aguirre Ferré.
1.15.1.1. Con: The Times implies that the writer was still in the administration at the time of publication. Ferre had already [left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Aguirre_Ferr%C3%A9) the administration by mid-August 2018.
1.15.1.2. Pro: The mention of Trump’s achievements seems formulaic and the enthusiasm seems feigned. Ms. Ferre was very critical of Trump in remarks she made during her tenure, which ended only recently.
1.15.1.2.1. Pro: The Op-Ed seems like a good-bye gift.
1.15.1.2.1.1. Pro: Ferré uniquely would not face any repercussions of being caught such as being fired.
1.15.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.15.2. Pro: Rob Porter, Former White House Staff Secretary
1.15.3. Pro: Hope Hicks, former White House communications director.
1.15.3.1. Con: All the evidence in the article is that the person is a current official. Hope Hicks left months ago.
1.15.3.2. Pro: Hicks resigned precipitously under [somewhat of a cloud](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/28/hope-hicks-resigns-trump-communications-director-white-house).
1.15.3.3. Pro: Hicks had close access to the Oval Office. She could have done those things suggested in the article.
1.15.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.16. Melania Trump
1.16.1. Con: The author gave the impression of being involved to policy development and implementation, and detailed discussions with other administration officials. This does not sound like the job description of the FLOTUS.
1.16.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.16.3. Con: Melania Trump publicly accused the Op-Ed writer of ["sabotaging"](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/06/politics/melania-trump-new-york-times-oped-sabotaging/index.html) the country and described the author as "cowardly" in their actions. Her disapproval of the author's actions suggests that she did not write the Op-Ed.
1.16.3.1. Con: As First Lady, it would have looked suspicious if she had not made a statement and remained silent on the matter. Melania coming to the defense of her husband may have been a strategical tactic to avert any suspicion that she had written the Op-Ed.
1.16.4. Con: The author states he/she is part of a resistance to Trump's administration. Melania Trump is not responsible for a part of the administration, that if not done according to Trump's instructions, would actively undermine the President's political agenda.
1.16.4.1. Con: Although the NYT refers to 'senior official' and 'he' as the contributor, these are just to further cover her identity.
1.16.5. Pro: Melania may be motivated to embarrass Trump due to his sex scandals, and authoring the Op-ed would be one way to achieve this.
1.16.5.1. Con: While she may have motive, it's not likely that she would be able to speak with the Times without someone in the administration knowing, as she is under constant surveillance/security as the First Lady.
1.16.5.1.1. Con: The Secret Service is not there to stop people from doing what they want, such as all of the Presidents who have conducted extra-marital affairs.
1.16.5.1.2. Con: Given Trump’s own reported use of [personal cell phones](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/23/politics/donald-trump-cell-phone/index.html), it is plausible that Melania could contact the NYT using technology not under surveillance by the Secret Service.
1.16.5.2. Con: Melania would lose the office of First Lady and the wide array of privileges that it comes with if Trump was impeached or voted out.
1.16.5.2.1. Con: Sources [suggest](https://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/flotus-melania-trump-east-wing-first-lady/amp) that Melania does not enjoy the position of FLOTUS.
1.16.5.2.1.1. Pro: It would be in her own interests, therefore, to anonymously attempt to cause a disruption in her husband’s presidency.
1.16.5.2.2. Pro: Melania has demonstrated that she is actively pursuing causes that she feels passionate about, which she would not be able to do as effectively if Trump was impeached or voted out.
1.16.5.2.2.1. Pro: Even prior to her husband assuming office, Melania publicly identified [cyber-bullying](https://www.bustle.com/p/what-does-melania-trump-do-the-first-lady-is-carving-out-her-signature-issues-8915939) as an issue that she wanted to tackle as a public figure, and has firmly committed herself to tackling this issue as first lady.
1.16.5.2.2.2. Pro: Melania's trips to [Africa and Europe](https://www.bustle.com/p/what-does-melania-trump-do-the-first-lady-is-carving-out-her-signature-issues-8915939) for the "Let Girls Learn" campaign - an initiative set up to fund “[new efforts to expand educational opportunities for girls](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-michelle-obama-let-girls-learn-ended-scrapped-white-house-a7712361.html)" – including in areas of conflict and crisis" - demonstrates her commitment to children's education.
1.16.5.2.2.3. Pro: If Melania is no longer FLOTUS, her efforts to pursue the political causes which she feels passionately about may be overshadowed by Donald Trump’s negative image.
1.17. It's entirely fabricated.
1.17.1. Pro: It looks to be a 100% match to a [USC student essay](https://conservativedailypost.com/was-the-times-duped-by-a-usc-student-to-run-hoax-op-ed/) according to antiplagiarism software company Turnitin.
1.17.1.1. Con: These allegations have not been substantiated other than a screenshot from a [single person's](https://twitter.com/MightyCassandra/status/1037695644180377603/photo/1) Twitter.
1.17.1.2. Con: Given the USC paper was supposedly submitted [on the same day](https://twitter.com/MightyCassandra/status/1037695644180377603/photo/1) as the opinion piece was run, it is more likely that a student just submitted a copy of the piece after the original article was released.
1.17.2. Pro: The NYT did not put the article behind a paywall. If they did fabricate it, presumably they would do that for financial reasons, and they're not gaining from it financially.
1.17.2.1. Con: Non-subscribers have been able to view the article multiple times, without notifications insisting they subscribe to view the material, while simultaneously receiving said pop-ups when attempting to read other articles by the NYT.
1.17.3. Pro: The New York Times is angry that their candidate lost and wants to get back at Trump. They did this out of spite, not financial gain.
1.17.3.1. Con: The New York Times has endorsed [losing candidates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_presidential_endorsements) before, and has never been accused of trying to "get back" at them.
1.17.4. Pro: A New York Times writer is the most obvious writer because the op-ed stirs up sales, creates drama to capitalize on the DJT derangement syndrome, and speaks to desperation over mid-terms..
1.17.4.1. Con: If it ever came out that it was fabricated, the reputation of the New York Times amongst its readership would be permanently damaged. It's unlikely that the newspaper would take such a risk for short-term publicity.
1.17.4.1.1. Con: It's claimed that only 3 people at the NYT know the identity of the author \[[CNN](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/09/media/new-york-times-op-ed-dean-baquet/index.html)\]. It's possible that those 3 fabricated it and that the rest of the staff of the New York Times believes it to be real.
1.17.4.1.1.1. Con: [At least three people](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/09/media/new-york-times-op-ed-dean-baquet/index.html) at the NYT are aware of the source. There could be more and that would be quite difficult to keep secret.
1.17.4.1.1.2. Con: Given the high-level positions held by the confirmed NYT employees, it is unlikely that they would risk the paper’s reputation.
1.17.4.2. Con: It's not clear why the Times would be "desperate over midterms" as midterm [odds](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-09-09/midterm-elections-democratic-waves-and-trump-october-surprises) are seen as overwhelmingly against Trump and the GOP.
1.17.4.2.1. Con: Polls have been inaccurate in the past.
1.17.4.2.1.1. Pro: The thriving economy occurs to voters at some point. Those who experienced the Great Recession and are trying to find a job may think twice before throwing that away because of party loyalty.
1.17.4.3. Con: Even if the reporting is biased, 'desperation' for one party makes no sense here because mid-terms generate enough captivating news on both sides to captivate readership.
1.17.5. Con: The NYT does not need publicity or a PR stunt to increase sales. Sales and circulation have increased and the Trump administration provides plenty of publicity. [forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulfletcher/2018/02/11/new-york-times-subscription-revenue-tops-1-billion-in-2017/#74859d0581b9)
1.17.5.1. Con: Further publicity and increased sales would not be unwelcome. The NYT is likely still facing financial pressures, as they made just $4m in profit in 2017 on 1.7bn in revenue.
1.17.5.1.1. Pro: Like all newspapers, the NYT is engaged in a battle to maintain and grow their subscriber base to increase profitability, and this may explicitly or subconsciously influence editorial decision making given the clear market for anti-Trump content.
1.17.5.2. Con: [Trump Bump](https://www.poynter.org/news/trump-bump-subscription-surge-brightens-otherwise-grey-results-new-york-times) is the only real growth the NYT is achieving - by monetizing anti-Trump nonsense to drive subscribers.
1.18. It was made at the direction of Donald Trump himself.
1.18.1. Con: The New York Times' mentioned that if the writer's identity were released, they would lose their job. If the information got out that Trump wrote the op-ed he wouldn't lose his job.
1.18.1.1. Con: If Donald Trump were in fact the author, he would give a false identity to the NYT.
1.18.2. Pro: Michael Moore [seems to think this may be the case.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-moore-donald-trump-nyt-oped_us_5b9eaab4e4b046313fbc24f0)
1.18.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.
1.18.4. Pro: The letter could be used to justify later action against the "deep state." Phrases such as "many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations" would help to justify a purge of top administration officials in favor of more subordinate replacements.
1.18.5. Con: Given that the Trump has shown himself to be [very sensitive](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/donald-trump-and-the-art-of-the-apology/516396/) to criticism, it is unlikely that he would have authorized a letter that, among other things, describes his leadership style as "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective."
1.18.6. Con: The New York Times presumably has knowledge of the letter's author. If it were written by Trump himself \(or by a proxy clearly acting on Trump's behalf\) they would not have published it.
1.19. An third party, such as a foreign intelligence agency, tricked the New York Times into believing that they were communicating with a member of the Trump administration.
1.19.1. Pro: The New York times has not specified how they communicated with the author [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/reader-center/anonymous-op-ed-trump.html). It seems unlikely that the author would have taken the risk of meeting in person, and it's becoming increasingly easy to fake video \[[businessinsider.nl](https://www.businessinsider.nl/obama-deepfake-video-insulting-trump-2018-4/?international=true&r=US)\].
1.19.2. Con: Three New York Times employees [claim](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/09/media/new-york-times-op-ed-dean-baquet/index.html) they know the identity of the author. If this is true - and not even Trump or his closest allies seem to have doubted the legitimacy of the piece - then they have all the necessary means to verify the role of this individual within the administration.
