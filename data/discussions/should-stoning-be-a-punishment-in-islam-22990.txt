Discussion Title: Should stoning be a punishment in Islam?

1. Should stoning be a punishment in Islam?
1.1. Yes, it should be legal under Sharia but every attempt possible should be made to prevent its enforcement.
1.1.1. Pro: This still highlights the severity of the wrongdoing, whilst attempting when at all possible to show the mercy of Allah SWT in all cases.
1.2. It should be a punishment under Islamic Law and it should be carried out in fact.
1.2.1. Con: Western nations will continue to attack the lands of Islam if they see how the will of Allah SWT is truly carried out.
1.2.2. Pro: It is mentioned clearly in the Hadith al Buhari, which is an account made of the life of the Prophet Muhammad \(ﷺ\) that has been accepted legal literature for over 1400 years. If this legal document states that the punishment should be stoning, it should be.
1.2.3. Pro: The Quran never forbids stoning as a punishment.
1.2.4. Pro: There is no harm in having a very harsh punishment against the most reprehensible of crimes, and a punishment over and above traditional execution to highlight the severity of the transgression.
1.3. No, it should not be used in Islam as the Quran does not discuss it.
1.3.1. Pro: The Quran is the book of God and the most reliable source of all things in Islam, and is the direct message of the Prophet \(ﷺ\).
1.3.2. Con: The Hadith are an important part of Islam, and Quranists are noted heretics and sinners who are not Muslim.
1.3.3. Con: The practice is an effective deterrant against adultery and the worst crime of all, homosexual intercourse.
