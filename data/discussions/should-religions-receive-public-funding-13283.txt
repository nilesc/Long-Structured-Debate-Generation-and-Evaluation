Discussion Title: Should Religions Receive Public Funding?

1. Religious organisations in liberal democracies should not receive any public funding \(direct or indirect\).
1.1. Pro: All religious organisations, regardless of their work, promote their own religion. That is not something a liberal democracy should actively facilitate.
1.1.1. Pro: Since a common principle of most organized religions is to indoctrinate new members, the amount of funding a religion might receive could either enhance or reduce its ability to gain new members relative to the ability of another religion, thereby inadvertently promoting one religion over another.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Many religions count teaching the faith among the principal duties of believers.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Inviting people to the religion is a meritorious activity in Islam. Muslims consider inviting others to Islam a collective duty as it is the mission originally carried out by the Prophets of Allah. The Quran says: "Invite to the Way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them \(non-believers\) in ways that are best and most gracious..." \([An-Nahl: 125](https://quran.com/16/125)\)
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Many Christians consider it their obligation to follow what is often termed the [Great Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Commission) of Jesus, recorded in the final verses of the Gospel of Matthew: "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen."  \([Matthew 28:19-20](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%2028.18%E2%80%9320)\)
1.1.1.2. Pro: Liberal democracies ought to be neutral between different religions in order to maintain freedom of religious worship, and therefore should not engage in actions which promote certain religions over others.
1.1.1.3. Pro: According to [a study](http://www.people-press.org/2001/04/10/faith-based-funding-backed-but-church-state-doubts-abound/) conducted by the Pew Forum, 60% of the American public expressed concern that religious groups that are funded by the government would proselytize among recipients of social services \(Kristine Schuerger, [pg.3](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/socwork/nrcfcpp/downloads/information_packets/faith_based_and_community_initiatives-pkt.pdf)\).
1.1.2. Con: Religious organizations [in USA](https://www.hhs.gov/answers/grants-and-contracts/what-are-the-rules-on-funding-religious-activity-with-federal-money/index.html) cannot use direct government support to support inherently religious activities like funding religious worship, instruction, or proselytization. Government money can only be used to support the non-religious social services that they provide. Other liberal democracies can adopt a similar model.
1.1.2.1. Con: Money is fungible; it is not possible to earmark funds for a particular purpose since doing so frees up revenue to be spent on other purposes.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Some religious organizations have refused to pay insurance premiums to firms that provide contraceptive options perceived to be too similar to [abortion](http://time.com/2941323/supreme-court-contraception-ruling-hobby-lobby/). Such organizations would not be satisfied if they were told that their money would not be spent on those products, and other peoples' money would be used instead.
1.1.3. Con: If religion is beneficial to society, it makes sense for the government to facilitate its propagation.
1.1.3.1. Con: This attitude may create tension between religious groups, if for instance, one sect within a religion is state recognised and another is not.
1.1.3.2. Con: It is not the government's job to propagate beneficial belief systems. Only to ensure that those organisations comply with it's laws.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Religion tends to make people [happier, healthier](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/11/keeping-the-faith/380799/), and more [civically engaged](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=cKmXDES703wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=american+grace+religion+civic+engagement&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=civic%20engagement&f=false).
1.1.4. Pro: Providing funding for the majority religion means that the country will begin to tilt in one religion's favor and eventually the religion will influence policy. Look at America and Christianity and you will see how it influences the entire country for Christians' benefit, and others' loss.
1.1.5. Pro: Religion and religious faith is a choice. The state should not fund anything that promotes a particular belief because it is then seen as endorsing one faith over another depending on whether it is funded or the amount of state support it gets.
1.2. Pro: The taxes of non-religious citizens should not go to religious organisations.
1.2.1. Con: If a religious organization is serving the common good it should be able to compete for government funding like any other entity.
1.2.1.1. Con: Services provided by religious organisations often discriminate against people not belonging to the faith of that organisation or adhering to its principles.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: In a survey of religious charities in the UK, only 5.4% strongly agreed with the statement ‘We only work with beneficiaries of our own faith,' whereas 55% strongly disagreed with the statement \([Wharton and Casas, p. 17](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=6&ved=0ahUKEwjg-vPugNjaAhVUasAKHcFuAa8QFghbMAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thinknpc.org%2Fpublications%2Fwhat-a-difference-faith-makes%2Fwhat-a-difference-a-faith-makes_npc%2F%3Fpost-parent%3D18631&usg=AOvVaw16Ie2rkTLMTAJBk5AyodVV)\).
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Religious organizations are often exempt from employment discrimination laws. In [the USA](https://www.justice.gov/archive/fbci/faq.html#Question10), religious organizations are free to take religion into account when selecting their employees.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Any organisation in the US that receives federal funding [cannot discriminate](https://www.justice.gov/archive/fbci/faq.html#Question10) in its provision of services; it must serve otherwise qualified persons in need of the funded social service, regardless of the beneficiaries’ religion and regardless whether or not the beneficiaries participate in any religious activity.
1.2.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.1.
1.2.1.1.4. Pro: Religious schools select their staff- both teaching and non-teaching- on grounds of their religion. The staff must also fit within [certain parameters](http://accordcoalition.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Employment_in_faith_schools.pdf) of personal behavior; for example, practicing Catholics can be ruled out if they have chosen to live with their partner before marriage, been divorced or are openly gay \(Association of Teachers and Lecturer, [pg.5](https://www.atl.org.uk/Images/Faith%20schools%20PS%202007.pdf)\).
1.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: [Catholic institutions](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2018/02/13/firing-lgbt-catholic-church-workers-raises-hard-and-new-questions) have been known to fire people from parishes and schools based on issues related to sexual orientation.
1.2.1.1.5. Pro: Many faith schools see their mission as the transmission of religious belief and culture from one generation to another. This results in [restrictive admission procedures](https://www.secularism.org.uk/uploads/faith-school-admissions-campaign-briefing-6.pdf) with the majority of places allocated to those from their own faith community and children from other faiths losing out on such education \(Association of Teachers and Lecturers, [pg.3](https://www.atl.org.uk/Images/Faith%20schools%20PS%202007.pdf)\).
1.2.1.1.5.1. Con: Faith-based schools are of great importance to their communities and ought to be protected.
1.2.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: For those that belong to minority religions, faith based schools serve as a safe space to recently immigrated children and families.
1.2.1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: Many faith schools have a points system under which children with the most points have the highest likelihood of being awarded a place at the school. Often these points benefit white middle-class areas and don't benefit [the immigrant children](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/nov/01/faith-schools-admissions-unfair) in the community.
1.2.1.1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: [In some schools](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/nov/01/faith-schools-admissions-unfair), if a parent volunteers at a church – for example, by bell-ringing – their child is given a higher priority for a school place. This disadvantages less well-off parents who do not have the time to volunteer.
1.2.1.1.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Some schools](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/nov/01/faith-schools-admissions-unfair) award points to children who have been baptized within three months of their birth.
1.2.1.1.5.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Many christian sects do not [Baptise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism#Mode_and_manner) infants, while others perform baptisms only when their child reaches the age of one. Such rules disadvantage members of such religions.
1.2.1.1.5.1.2. Con: Teachings that are derived from the word of God and other religious texts can hold a bias against scientific findings.
1.2.1.1.5.1.3. Pro: For families that do not have easy access to a place to practice and teach their religion but where faith is a priority, these schools become partners in helping children develop an intimate understanding of and connection to their faith.
1.2.1.1.5.1.4. Pro: Attending a religious school might allow a child to more fully appreciate their heritage and culture.
1.2.1.1.5.1.4.1. Pro: This is especially true when the students may belong to a minority community that is perpetually surrounded by a culture different from their own.
1.2.1.1.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: For example, a Muslim child living in the United States would always be surrounded by Judaeo-Christian norms and values. Getting a traditional education at a Madrasa might give them a level of understanding and appreciation for their culture they would never get if they went to a public institution.
1.2.1.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.5.1.1.1.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Funding to religous organisations can be provided on the basis of direct social good, and on a competitive basis with existing social services. This can ensure that tax payer money is better spent than it would be otherwise.
1.2.2. Con: We often recognise that it is a social good for all taxpayers to subsidise some people's consumption of an important good. For example, we subsidise access to higher education for low-income people.
1.2.2.1. Con: Due to the low attendance of religion institutions, they are inefficient at what they do as they have to upkeep unused infrastructure for a small amount of people.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Many buildings and objects of national and international importance as shared cultural heritage are owned and administered by religious organisations, who act as custodians on behalf of wider society. [\(See this article in the Guardian for some data on ownership of church properties in the UK, for example.\)](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2015/oct/15/we-must-do-to-our-churches-what-beeching-did-to-the-railways)
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Many of these buildings are tourist attractions making a lot of money, so mostly there is no need to subsidize religious organisations. For example ticket for Sagrada Familia costs 15-20 euros to cover the annual construction budget of 25 million euros.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: The architectural merit of grand religious buildings is present regardless of whether they are actively used for religious service and [can be preserved independently of that use](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/religionglobalsociety/2017/07/disused-churches-documenting-the-adaptive-reuse-of-religious-buildings/).
1.2.2.1.2. Con: Local congregations devote a substantial proportion of their budgets to the upkeep of their physical plant because their facilities benefit the community. Their physical infrastructure is extensively used by the entire community for free or at a nominal fee. In Canada, a host of community groups, like Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, Alcoholics Anonymous, day cares and seniors groups, are regular users of congregational halls and meeting rooms. \(Religion, Participation, and Charitable Giving, [pg.30](http://imaginecanada.ca/sites/default/files/www/en/giving/rp_1997_religion_participation_and_charitable_giving_en.pdf)\)
1.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.
1.2.3. Con: The taxes of citizens are used to support all manner of non-profits \(if just by allowing for tax deductions on donations\) that perform activities that individuals may find objectionable, such as for a political cause group or a hunting club. It is unclear why religions should not be treated similarly.
1.2.4. Pro: Religion is [in decline](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-zuckerman/religion-declining-secula_b_9889398.html) in many liberal democracies. Governments should not continue funding an institution that people are moving away from.
1.2.4.1. Pro: In the [United States](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/11/03/u-s-public-becoming-less-religious/), somewhere between 23% and 28% of American adults have no religious affiliation, and these so-called “[nones](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/13/a-closer-look-at-americas-rapidly-growing-religious-nones/)” are not only growing in number, but they are becoming increasingly secular in their behaviors and beliefs.
1.2.4.2. Pro: For the first time in British history, there are now [more atheists](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/uk-is-one-of-the-least-religious-countries-in-the-world-survey-finds-10173589.html) and agnostics than believers in God. Church attendance rates in the UK are at an all-time low, with [less than 2%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/church-of-england-attendance-falls-below-million-first-time?CMP=share_btn_tw) of British men and women attending church on any given Sunday.
1.2.4.3. Con: If religion is in decline, their revenue and ability to provide services will decline too; this naturally reduces their funding. There is no need to cut it off prematurely.
1.2.5. Pro: Things funded by taxes should be public goods, which benefit everyone in society, regardless of their identity. Funding a religion does not benefit everyone and can even harm some people if that religion is hostile to one's lifestyle or choices.
1.2.5.1. Con: Every lifestyle choice has a contrary. Taken as is, this would mean the government should not fund anything.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: There are many things the government funds that is not related to lifestyle choices, for instance building and maintenance of roads, scientific research and healthcare to name just a few.
1.2.5.2. Con: The vast majority of things which are funded by taxes do not benefit everyone. For example, unemployment benefits do not benefit people who will be employed throughout their life.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: Everyone benefits from the existence of public infrastructure even if they do not personally make use of it. E.g. The existence of a social safety net benefits individuals who never make use of it by providing them with a sense of security.
1.2.5.3. Pro: Freedom to practice a religion of a person's preference \(or freedom not to practice\) is a personal choice.  Taxes  are required to be paid \(by law\). Government funds should be used where citizens have equal access to services without regard to the religion that they choose to practice.
1.2.6. Con: Citizens do not get to object to the way their taxes being spent on any specific good or policy because we value the practical benefit of funding things people want more than the harm of forcing individuals to fund things they don't personally support.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Conscientious objectors are forced to fund wars.
1.2.6.2. Pro: Pro-lifers are forced to fund abortions.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: This is a false equivalency. Abortion is a matter of public health, religion is not a public health issue.
1.2.7. Pro: It is immoral to force people to fund things they are ideologically opposed to.
1.2.7.1. Con: If this principle were adhered to, taxation would become basically impossible. Everyone is opposed to some government program or other, so taxing anyone would be considered morally wrong.
1.2.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
1.2.8. Pro: The opportunity cost of funding religious organizations is very high. The lost revenue can be used on other projects that benefit everyone.
1.2.8.1. Pro: According to a research by a sociologist at the University of Tampa, the estimated annual government subsidy of religion in the U.S. is $71 billion. The actual figure is most likely higher since this estimate excludes the cost of a number of subsidies, like local income and property tax exemptions and the sales tax exemption. The estimate that religious groups own $600 billion in property is also probably low, since it leaves out property besides actual churches, mosques, etc. \([pg.6](http://users.clas.ufl.edu/kenwald/rpp/cragun.pdf)\)
1.2.8.2. Pro: The charitable deduction for all groups cost USA about $39 billion [in 2013](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/08/22/you-give-religions-more-than-82-5-billion-a-year/?utm_term=.05d233714ac3). Given that 32 percent of those donations were to religious groups, getting rid of it just for them would have raised about $12.5 billion.
1.2.9. Con: A lot of non-religious people do like the church buildings for instance. If the public wants to maintain the buildings, it would also be fair to give partial public funding. Unless such building attracts enough paying tourists, but that's the exception.
1.3. Con: Religious schools provide valuable education to many children in society; without state assistance, some of these children will lose out on such education.
1.3.1. Pro: In the US, roughly 80% of private schools are [religiously affiliated](http://www.capenet.org/facts.html), and many of these are experiencing financial difficulties.
1.3.1.1. Pro: 85% of schools in the US that [accept vouchers](http://uk.businessinsider.com/catholic-schools-voucher-programs-study-2017-2?r=US&IR=T) are religiously affiliated - these are the schools that provide education to low income families who don't feel confident about their local public school. If these religious schools are forced to reject vouchers because they can't accept public funding, students will be forced to go to worse public schools.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Public funding through vouchers is the [only reason](http://uk.businessinsider.com/catholic-schools-voucher-programs-study-2017-2?r=US&IR=T) many Catholic schools in the US are able to operate at all, as earnings from other sources such as donations are unable to cover costs.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: The average voucher-accepting Catholic school in Milwaukee [received](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/02/the-catholic-schools-saved-by-vouchers/516888/) about $1 million per year from the program in 2012, a serious help for cash-strapped parochial schools.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Religious schools in the US tend to charge [modest tuition fees](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/02/the-catholic-schools-saved-by-vouchers/516888/) compared to other private schools, and as a result need governmental assistance if they are to continue providing quality education.
1.3.2. Con: Students in faith schools are least likely to report that their schools says homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying is wrong, leading to an uncomfortable and often painful environment for LGBT students \([Stonewall, p. 20](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/sites/default/files/the_school_report_2017.pdf)\).
1.3.2.1. Pro: Only 10% of LGBT students in faith schools in the UK have learnt about where to go for help and advice about same-sex relationships at school \([Stonewall, p. 22](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/sites/default/files/the_school_report_2017.pdf)\).
1.3.2.2. Pro: LGBT pupils in faith schools are more likely than those in non-faith schools to say that teachers and school staff never challenge homophobic, biphobic and transphobic language when they hear it \(31 per cent compared to 22 per cent\) \([Stonewall, p. 18](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/sites/default/files/the_school_report_2017.pdf)\).
1.3.2.3. Pro: At least 14% of state funded religious schools in the US take an active stance against LGBTQ staff and students, [specifically stating](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/discrimination-lgbt-private-religious-schools_us_5a32a45de4b00dbbcb5ba0be) that students can face punishments, like expulsion, for displaying signs of a “homosexual lifestyle” or “alternate gender identity.”
1.3.3. Pro: It is important that religious parents have the option to send their children to a school that shares their faith.
1.3.3.1. Pro: The right to freely exercise one's religion implies the right to help one's child be immersed in that religion.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: One is free to raise a child to enjoy an obscure sport but it doesnt entitle them to receive money from the government \(every citizen\) to 'immerse' them in it, specifically.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: It is not uncommon for public schools or public initiatives to heavily focus on particular sports or activities such as drama or music. These are equally exclusionary; but are options the government makes available to the public because it recognises that children should be supported in self-actualising in more specific ways than a general educational curricula offers; whether that be through a particular academic focus, extra-curricular activities, or religious instruction.
1.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: It is still better to improve "possibly exclusionary" public school programs and initiatives instead of publicly funding religions.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Almost all religions include some element of proselytising; for which one's own children is the most rewarding and accessible target.
1.3.3.1.2.1. Con: One could argue that this 'tendency' to proselytize can have negative impacts as well \([as research shows](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/religious-children-are-more-selfish-than-atheist-children-say-us-neuroscientists-a6723596.html)\) or that parents should not see their children as accessible 'targets' for their own nonsensiscal beliefs.
1.3.3.1.3. Pro: The prerogative to teach your child your religion is the natural extension of parent's key role educating children about how to live and navigate the world \(outside of a purely academic context\).
1.3.3.1.3.1. Con: It can never be a natural extension since religious systems were invented by humankind and are by definition not natural.
1.3.3.1.3.2. Con: The parents being the sole responsible for raising children is a fairly new concept and should not be seen as a universal 'truth'. In [older times](https://www.neatorama.com/neatobambino/2010/07/26/parenting-through-history-a-look-at-childrearing-in-five-historic-societies/) the raising of a child would be trusted to a wet nurse, a community of women or even other families for a variety of reasons \(none of which had to do with 'passing on the religious beliefs'\).
1.3.3.1.4. Con: The freedom of religion implies both negative \(absence of authority over your belief\) and positive \(capabilities of choosing for yourself\). As children are also humans they should be able to enjoy the universal human rights and can therefore not be forced \(not by a government not by a parent\) to follow certain ways of belief, sending them to faith-based school is in essence forcing them to follow the beliefs of their parents and denying them the capability/opportunity to choose for themselves.
1.3.3.1.5. Con: A right does not come with a subsidy. The right to help means you can teach them. You can pay for others to teach them. It does not mean you can make others pay to teach them your beliefs.
1.3.3.2. Con: Education should be a secular domain, particularly if it receives state funding. Sunday schools and other institutions should be sufficient to impart religious teachings privately — there is no need for that to also be a part of the standard school day.
1.3.3.3. Pro: 53% of Americans say [religion](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/11/03/chapter-1-importance-of-religion-and-religious-beliefs/) is an important part of their lives. Parents should be able to ensure their kids are educated on the values and subjects they find important.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: And they should then do it themselves, not expect others to pay for it. This is what churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples are for.
1.3.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.5.1.4.
1.3.4. Con: State schools provide valuable education to many children in society. It is not proven that faith schools would provide better education if thay have the same constraints, budget and regulations.
1.3.4.1. Con: It is not necessary to have the same budget, constraint and regulations to support funding. Only that it provide better value to the state than supporting a private school for the same price.
1.3.5. Con: The curricula used by religious schools are often problematic, and should not be promoted by the state.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Religious education does not tend to include comprehensive [sexual education](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/opinion/the-worlds-problem-with-sex-ed.html), which can have wide ranging effects on the health and emotional wellbeing of the students.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Faith based schools often use textbooks that are directly contradictory to science.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: Public schools often have curricula free from religious bias, whereas religious schools often [promote](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11578432/Creationism-still-taught-in-faith-schools-despite-Government-funding-threat.html) false and intellectually damaging ideas like creationism and homophobia as accurate.
1.3.5.3. Con: This is a very US-centric problem. In most jurisdictions, religious schools must teach the same curriculum as public schools, or at least meet similar [standards](https://www.finder.com.au/public-and-private-schooling).
1.3.5.3.1. Con: If a religious school is teaching the same curriculum as public schools then there is no point in it being a religious school. It may as well be a public school.
1.3.5.3.1.1. Con: Religious schools can still provide extra-curricular religious activities, access to religious support networks and allow religious students to congregate.
1.3.5.3.1.1.1. Con: Religious students can still be offered space to perform whatever extra curricular religious activities they wish in a public school in their own time.
1.3.5.3.1.1.2. Con: Presumably religious students would already have these support networks at their places of worship.
1.3.5.3.1.1.3. Con: Religious education is already a feature of [some nation's national curricula.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_education_in_primary_and_secondary_education#England)
1.3.5.3.2. Con: Even though they may have to teach the same curriculum, there is a temptation to contradict the teachings of said curriculum. Suggesting to pupils - "although this is what the curriculum states it is in fact wrong, we believe 'x'".
1.3.6. Pro: The state system lacks the capacity to handle all religious school students.
1.3.6.1. Con: The funding used to fund students in a religious school could be used to fund expansion of current public institutions.
1.3.6.2. Con: The state can employ the same teachers and use the same buildings for secular schools.
1.3.6.2.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that the state would handle the infrastructure as well as many religious organizations do.
1.3.6.2.1.1. Pro: Religious organizations must compete for funding while governments do not. This creates an incentive for religious organizations to be efficient.
1.3.6.2.1.1.1. Con: This competition may create a divisive and corrupt attitude towards the treatment of social ills, much like the state of healthcare in the US.
1.3.6.2.1.1.2. Con: Religious organizations have other ways of getting finances, like gifts and donations. State assistance is therefore unnecessary.
1.3.6.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Government funding is often not the main source of revenue for religious organizations. In Canada, almost two‐thirds \(64%\) of all revenues for religious organizations come from gifts and donations. The second most important source of revenues is earned income \(24%\), followed by government funding \(8%\). \(Imagine Canada, [pg.26](http://www.imaginecanada.ca/sites/default/files/www/en/library/misc/understanding_capacity_religious_orgs_report.pdf)\)
1.3.6.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Nearly three quarters of Americans’ charitable giving \(73%\) goes to organizations with religious ties. \(Connected to Give, [pg.10](http://connectedtogive.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ConnectedToGive_FaithCommunities_Jumpstart2014_v1.3.pdf)\)
1.3.6.2.1.1.2.3. Con: If religious organizations are still unsustainable after receiving funding from these other revenue streams, the government should step in.
1.3.6.2.1.2. Pro: Governments must constantly compete with political opposition in order to get re-elected or preserve incumbency. As such, the long term goals of a specific community may never be prioritized in their minds. Since a religious organization exists to solely serve its community, it is better equipped and incentivized to carry out such activities.
1.3.6.2.2. Con: It is unclear how the state would gain access to private schools' infrastructure, short of nationalization.
1.3.6.2.2.1. Con: The state could acquire this property from the religious schools who are no longer financially viable after they receive no state funding.
1.3.6.2.2.1.1. Con: If the state had the resources to purchase religious schools resources, they would have used that money to expand their capacity in the status quo.
1.3.6.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Bankrupted or loss making religious schools would likely have to sell of their assets well below market value.
1.3.6.3. Con: These students could quite easily be transferred to state funded public schools.
1.3.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.1.
1.3.6.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.2.
1.3.6.4. Pro: In the United States, approximately [7.9%](http://www.capenet.org/facts.html) of all school students are in religious private schools. The number in [Canada](http://www.ofis.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Private-Schools-By-The-Numbers-Independent-School-Statistics-2012.pdf) is similar. That large of an influx is very difficult to handle in short order.
1.3.6.5. Con: While a cut in public funding would certainly mean a reduction in students in private schools and an increase in public schools, it would not result in all students leaving private schools for public schools as many private schools [already](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-19/private-school-is-becoming-out-of-reach-for-middle-class-americans) cater to wealthy students who can afford an education even without public subsidy.
1.3.6.6. Pro: On average 15% of students in the OECD [attended](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisainfocus/48482894.pdf) a private school, with 70% of those students \(10.5%\) [attending](https://www.oecd.org/education/School-choice-and-school-vouchers-an-OECD-perspective.pdf) a private religious school.
1.3.6.7. Pro: In Australia, approximately 20% of students went to a [Catholic](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs\@.nsf/mf/4221.0) school.
1.3.6.8. Pro: There was a [significant case](https://www.goulburnpost.com.au/story/130200/a-strike-changed-it-all/) in Australia in 1962 where 600 students from Catholic Schools which closed over a funding issue attempted to enrol at their local Government school on one Monday morning.
1.3.7. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.5.
1.4. Con: Every individual has a right to practice their religion; sometimes, this practice requires a religious institution which can only survive if the state provides financial assistance.
1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.1.1.2.
1.4.2. Pro: Small churches \(or mosques, synagogues, temples etc\) already struggle to survive and would be further endangered by [a new tax burden](http://www.sstibbs.com/scott/2009_archives/2009_editorial_08.html) or discontinuation of government support. This could threaten their existence and the government would thus be impeding religious expression.
1.4.2.1. Pro: A [2010 survey](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/2011-04-21-churches_recession-money_21_ST_N.htm) by the Hartford Institute for Religion Research found that congregations facing financial strain more than doubled to almost 20% in the past decade, with 5% of congregations unlikely to recover.
1.4.2.2. Con: If a religious organization does not have the members or resources to sustain itself, then there is not [sufficient societal demand](https://listverse.com/2013/10/04/10-forgotten-ancient-religions/) for the services it provides. The government should not artificially prop up religions.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Seminary-trained pastors often carry a lot of student debt and realize that debt will not [easily be paid back](http://www.ethicsdaily.com/7-reasons-smaller-churches-struggle-and-close-cms-21028) from the salaries smaller churches often offer, forcing smaller churches to rely on lay pastors instead.
1.4.2.4. Pro: About 20 Church of England buildings are [closed down](https://www.ft.com/content/fced3f20-9294-11e7-a9e6-11d2f0ebb7f0) every year for lack of funding.
1.4.2.5. Pro: The financial health of many mosques in USA has worsened since 2005. According to the US Mosque Survey 2011, 11% of mosques \(out of 727\) reported that they were in some financial difficulty in 2011, while in 2005 only 8% saw themselves in some financial difficulty. Fewer mosques in 2011 \(60%\) indicated that they are in good or excellent financial health than in 2005\(67%\).  \(The American Mosque 2011, [pg.23](http://www.hartfordinstitute.org/The-American-Mosque-Report-2.pdf)\)
1.4.3. Pro: The ability of an individual to practice their religion is so important to them that the state has a positive duty to give them the resources they need to worship, rather than solely a negative duty not to interfere with their worshipping.
1.4.3.1. Con: Religions are a set of beliefs that do not require organisations to practice.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Many religions, [for example Christianity](https://www.ucg.org/bible-study-tools/bible-questions-and-answers/what-is-fellowship), explicit tie worship practices to collectives or communities. These require organisations.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: A lot of religious activities such as [festivals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_festival#By_religion), [coming-of-age ceremonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_age#Religious) and marriages are community based - and cannot be conducted outside a social setting.
1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.4.5. Con: It would be difficult to determine how much money to give to each religious organisation.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Allowing religions to self report their size would allow them to easily manipulate the system without close and rigorous monitoring.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Basing the determination on census data could artificially inflate the size of religions that are seen as a cultural identity - people would report they believe the religion when in fact they do not believe or participate, but consider themselves culturally affiliated with it.
1.4.5.3. Con: A simple mathematical formula that represents the amount of public funding received as a function of the number of recipients and the cost of service provision could solve this issue.
1.4.5.4. Con: There's no reason to believe this would be any more difficult than determining government funding for any other NGO or not-for-profit.
1.4.5.4.1. Con: NGOs do not usually consist of ideologies with associated cultural affiliations. Supporting them does not often invite conflict. For example if one religious sect is recognised and another opposing sect is not.
1.4.5.4.2. Con: Church financial reports, if provided, are of limited usefulness in assessing whether the church has achieved its main objectives. Much of the work of religious organizations deals with issues pertaining to the soul, such as spreading the word of God, saving souls and attending to the poor, and it is almost impossible to fully measure the results of these activities.
1.4.5.5. Con: The government is more than capable of determining and allocating funding.
1.4.6. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.4.7. Con: A freedom to do something does not imply a government obligation to financially assist you to do it.
1.4.7.1. Pro: Freedom of speech grants the individual the right to express their opinions free from government persecution. It doesn't obligate the government to give individuals a platform from which to voice their views.
1.4.8. Con: The faithful should now allow themselves to be exploited by the state's funding drip. It cheapens their faith motivated sacrifices and weakens the sincerity of their expressed resolve to correct the evils of our naturally self-serving human societies. One cannot show true love of their neighbour if they are being paid to do so by the state.
1.4.9. Con: Practicing religion is voluntary and therefore should be self-funded.  Only in a theocracy should the government give aid to a religion.
1.4.9.1. Pro: Without any funds, followers will still be able to practice on their own.
1.4.10. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.4.11. Con: Religions should be wholly supported by their adherents. If a religion can not survive without money or aid from the government, it does not deserve to exist.
1.5. Pro: The oversight required to ensure that public funding is being used properly will force governments to monitor religious organizations, something that is both difficult to accomplish and in the interests of neither governments nor religious organizations.
1.5.1. Pro: Resources used to fund such monitoring cannot be used to fund charitable causes.
1.5.2. Con: Governments will equally need to monitor religious organisations either way; it just shifts the nature of monitoring from verification \(offsetting tax payments\) to compliance \(ensuring tax is paid\).
1.5.3. Pro: Given the animosity between many religions \(particularly those of minority groups\) and the state, having explicit oversight could fuel further distrust.
1.5.3.1. Pro: People who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible are less likely than others to trust government \([Poppe, p. 36](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a48a/3b99970ed7a7578cb00acf6cfbdbb3a53181.pdf)\).
1.5.3.2. Con: On the contrary, people who demonstrate high levels of religious behavior are more likely than others to trust government \([Poppe, p. 36](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a48a/3b99970ed7a7578cb00acf6cfbdbb3a53181.pdf)\).
1.5.3.3. Pro: According to [a study](http://www.people-press.org/2001/04/10/faith-based-funding-backed-but-church-state-doubts-abound/) conducted by the Pew Forum, 68% of the American public worry that government funding of religious organizations\([faith-based initiatives](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Faith-based_initiative)\) might lead to too much government involvement in religion \(Kristine Schuerger,[pg.3](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/socwork/nrcfcpp/downloads/information_packets/faith_based_and_community_initiatives-pkt.pdf)\).
1.5.4. Pro: Religious organizations show a lack of transparency and accountability, even to their donors.
1.5.4.1. Pro: In a 2004 survey of 548 southern Baptist Churches, it was found that Churches lacked basic control against mismanagement and abuse of Church funds. 70% of the Churches surveyed did not have written financial procedures, 20% of the Churches did not require any written documentations at all before funds were disbursed, only 22% required written explanation for budget variances, and only 52% reported the budgeted versus actual spending on a monthly basis \(Mosque fund management, [pg.2](https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877042814038841/1-s2.0-S1877042814038841-main.pdf?_tid=349171b7-9711-442c-a074-79f3e9b03914&acdnat=1524340180_7a47fb5ced09f3edc2c7ac32cf7bc018)\).
1.5.4.2. Pro: Many churches view money and wealth as inherently evil, and are likely to be reluctant to embrace accounting. This results in a failure to effectively monitor their own finances, and often an aversion to doing so at all \(Afifuddin and Siti-Nabiha, [pg.2](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9efe/410d31b5762c997b50478ab7ac088ca4a2f2.pdf)\).
1.5.4.3. Pro: Although church financial disclosures are relatively infrequent and not uniform across churches, this deficit does not alter the confidence of church members that their contributions are being used appropriately. Moreover, pastors consistently trust their employees and rely more heavily on the concept of trust than on deployment of effective internal controls \(Cornell, Johnson and Schwartz, [pg.1](http://web.nacva.com/JFIA/Issues/JFIA-2013-1_5.pdf)\).
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: Unlike other non-profit organisations, churches are exempt from filing informational tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service. Without any mandatory reporting requirements, this lack of disclosure makes churches ripe for the growth of various forms of fraud and abuse \([Cornell, Johnson and Schwartz, p. 86](http://web.nacva.com/JFIA/Issues/JFIA-2013-1_5.pdf)\).
1.5.4.4. Con: Providing that accountability and transparency to the government comes with a strong financial reward for doing so.
1.5.4.5. Con: Monitoring the funds granted to religious organizations is possible through legal obligations. All faith-based and community groups that receive [federal funds in the USA](https://www.justice.gov/archive/fbci/faq.html#Question11) are subject to basic audit requirements. Grant recipients are required to keep accurate records of all transactions conducted with federal funds and must file regular financial status reports.
1.5.4.6. Con: The government could just make public funding contingent on compliance with additional rigorous accounting and auditing processes.
1.5.5. Con: Governments should have oversight of religious organisations in order to prevent abuse, such as that of [children within the Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases).
1.5.5.1. Con: The kinds of oversight that monitor for potential child abuse are unlikely to be the kinds of monitoring used to ensure that religions comply with funding regulations.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: If a problem as systemic and significant as abuse can be audited and subjected to proper oversight, allocation of funds can be subjected to similar regulation as well.
1.5.6. Con: -> See 1.5.4.5.
1.5.7. Con: Governments ensuring religious organizations spend their money well would produce more efficient and accountable religious organizations.
1.5.8. Pro: It is unlikely the government would be able to monitor religious organizations effectively.
1.5.8.1. Pro: Major religious organisations are very well established and very wide spread. Monitoring them would require a significant initial and continual amount of resources.
1.5.8.2. Pro: Government oversight often falls victim to regulatory capture.
1.5.8.2.1. Pro: Religious institutions have a large and concentrated interest in ensuring beneficial regulatory outcomes, while the public's interest is diluted over a large population.
1.5.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.4.2.
1.6. Con: Government funding of religious organizations can be an efficient way of fulfilling social needs that would otherwise go unaddressed.
1.6.1. Con: The state is the better actor to achieve social goals.
1.6.1.1. Pro: The state has the advantage of economies of scale.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: The state can utilize its existing bureaucracy and infrastructure to distribute welfare.
1.6.1.1.2. Pro: Allowing one organization to handle welfare allows for centralization.
1.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: A [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geer.12021) evaluated the relative success of a centralized and decentralized welfare administration in terms of integrating welfare recipients into employment. Compared to centralized organization the decentralized organization had a negative effect on employment chances of males. For women, no significant effect was found.
1.6.1.1.2.2. Pro: Centralization prevents duplication of services.
1.6.1.2. Pro: The state is elected and therefore publicly accountable.
1.6.1.2.1. Pro: The possibility of corruption is lower and more easily regulated in a publicly accountable organisation.
1.6.1.3. Pro: The state has an obligation to ensure the well-being of its citizens.
1.6.1.3.1. Con: Just because the obligation exists does not mean that the state is well placed to fulfill the obligation. There are plenty of obligations that the state outsources to other, better positioned actors.
1.6.1.3.2. Pro: The state is more likely to ensure welfare is distributed equitably.
1.6.1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.6.1.4. Pro: Government funding for welfare, health and social care programs, etc is a much more cost effective way of addressing social needs.
1.6.1.5. Con: Seeking assistance through religious organisations, rather than the State, often has less stigma and fewer hurdles than doing so within a community tied together by a common belief.
1.6.1.6. Con: [Eligibility](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2016/10/13/welfare-offers-short-term-help-and-long-term-poverty/#22dab0632cd3) for government welfare is often arbitrary, and not indicative of actual need.
1.6.1.7. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.1.1.
1.6.1.8. Pro: Governments tend to focus on long term solutions and programs like food stamps and health services. Religious organizations, on the other hand, focus on much smaller issues which makes the scale of their work trivial as compared to what the government does.
1.6.1.8.1. Pro: Using a national survey of religious congregations in the US, a Duke Divinity School professor found that [83 percent](http://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/7/5/55) of congregations have some sort of program to help needy people in their communities. Most often, however, these efforts provide clothing, food, and temporary shelter, rather than intensive, long-term programs on substance abuse, post-prison rehabilitation, or immigrant resettlement. The median amount congregations spent on social-service programs was $1,500.
1.6.2. Pro: Religious organisations are major players in the world of non-profit organizations active in providing international relief and assistance.
1.6.2.1. Pro: A study by Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government found that the total revenue for private voluntary organizations in 2005 was $15.9 billion, and of this amount 46 percent \(or $7.3 billion\) was revenue received by religious private voluntary organizations \(PVO\), which indicates that the average religious PVO was larger in terms of revenue than the average secular PVO. \(Pluralism and Freedom: Faith-based Organizations in a Democratic Society, [pg.21](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=Tuy97nvRJXYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.6.4. Pro: Religious charities have a relatively unique advantage in that they draw from members of their congregations to provide free labour for charitable causes. This massive amount of human resources could go untapped if organisations dont have the capital needed to put them to use.
1.6.4.1. Con: It is not necessary that members of a congregation would only volunteer for that particular religious organization. Religiously active people can also choose to volunteer for secular organizations instead. 79 per cent of religiously active Canadians volunteer outside of their religious domain. Even among weekly attenders of congregation who volunteer, more \(73 per cent\) do so in secular agencies than in religious ones \(55 per cent\). \(Religion, Participation, and Charitable Giving, [pg.18](http://imaginecanada.ca/sites/default/files/www/en/giving/rp_1997_religion_participation_and_charitable_giving_en.pdf)\)
1.6.4.2. Con: There is [no correlation](https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/voices/david-ainsworth-which-charity-has-the-most-volunteers.html) between the the type of charity and the number of people volunteering for it: in the UK, the list of largest charities by volunteer numbers is a mixture of big national charities, religious organisations, and small membership bodies.
1.6.4.3. Pro: Regular worshippers are more than twice as likely to have volunteered in a given three month period \(43%\) than the typical individual \(21%\), suggesting that religious charities have a strong volunteer base to draw upon \([p. 2](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0ahUKEwiM44-QidjaAhVsCcAKHemwCMgQFghfMAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk%2Flibrary%2Fcfr-m-nfp-synergy-volunteering-facts-figures-november-2016%2Fnfpsynergy-volunteering-facts-figures-november-2016.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3hHLuH3O_ZCdIUHEXJxzB7)\).
1.6.4.4. Con: 44% of Americans say they have volunteered for a religious organization within the past 12 months \(from December 2017\) as compared to 51% who volunteered at secular charities. This is [accompanied](http://news.gallup.com/poll/224378/religious-giving-down-charity-holding-steady.aspx) by a largely flat rate of volunteering for religious charities, while the number of people volunteering for secular charities has been increasing.
1.6.4.5. Pro: A 2001 study shows that congregations are highly involved in social service provision and almost nine of every ten congregations, regardless of size and ethnic composition, are engaged in at least one social service provision \(University of Pennsylvania, [pg.9](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context=spp_papers)\).
1.6.5. Pro: Without public funding, many religious charities will not be able to help those in need.
1.6.5.1. Con: The money could be donated to non-religious charities instead.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: [Unlike](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/exceptions-charities-and-religion-or-belief-organisations) religious charities, non-religious charities are unbiased in the way they use funding. They deliver charity to people of all creeds without the temptation to withhold aid from people unwilling to participate in religious practices or preach to the people they're providing aid to.
1.6.5.1.2. Con: The religiosity or ideology of these charities are often critical to their efficiency and reach.
1.6.5.1.3. Pro: Secular groups do charitable work far more efficiently than religious organizations.
1.6.5.1.3.1. Con: Non-religious charities have the same fraud track record as religious charities \([see names of top ten U.S. charities that misappropriate](http://www.investmentwatchblog.com/many-of-the-largest-charities-in-america-are-giant-money-making-scams/) donation dollars, none of which are religious.\)
1.6.5.1.3.2. Pro: A significant portion of the money in the religious sector goes towards [maintenance of religious buildings](https://www.theguardian.com/society/joepublic/2011/may/20/church-volunteers-big-society): stone work, organ, glass, roof and heating have to be undertaken professionally and frequently, as well as basic housekeeping, cleaning, worship administration, with rotas for reading, vestment layout, candle lighting, service administration, flowers, choirs, and funerals. All of this is money that could have otherwise gone towards secular goods for all of society.
1.6.5.1.3.2.1. Pro: According to a University of Tampa [study](http://bigthink.com/21st-century-spirituality/how-to-make-71-billion-a-year-tax-the-churches) of 271 congregations, an average of 71% of church revenue goes to “operating expenses,” while help to the poor is somewhere within the remaining 29%. In comparison, the American Red Cross uses 92% of revenues for aid to the public and only about 8% on operating expenses.
1.6.5.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Different organizations have different administration costs depending on the type of services they provide. It is inaccurate to compare average church operating expenses to the operating expenses of one specific charity.
1.6.5.1.3.2.1.2. Con: On average, charities spend [83%](http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/charities-spend-up-to-83-per-cent-of-donations-chasing-more-fundraising-dollars/news-story/3355f4971802e6e230ca158c33c253c4) of their revenue on administration costs.
1.6.5.1.3.2.1.3. Con: Administration costs are an [ineffective metric](https://www.acnc.gov.au/ACNC/FTS/Fact_administration.aspx) for determining the impact and benefit a charity has on the community.
1.6.5.1.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: There is no consistent metric for determining what administration costs are - each organization determines them [differently](https://www.acnc.gov.au/ACNC/FTS/Fact_administration.aspx).
1.6.5.1.3.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Administration costs are costs that are not directly incurred in providing a charitable service. It is highly subjective whether something is a directly incurred cost.
1.6.5.1.3.2.1.3.2. Pro: Certain types of charitable activities require greater infrastructure, maintenance or setup costs than others.
1.6.5.1.3.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: Charities that operate internationally will often have higher costs due to the necessities of transporting people, goods and equipment.
1.6.5.1.3.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: Certain charitable activities, such as providing psychological care, tend to be more expensive than providing other types of assistance such as food or antibiotics.
1.6.5.1.3.2.1.3.2.3. Pro: While charities often provide similar services - they often differ in various ways that make them hard to accurately compare - e.g. The size of meals provided, organizational structure of the charity, the quality of the service.
1.6.5.1.3.2.1.4. Con: The American Red Cross may be [less effective](https://www.charitywatch.org/charitywatch-articles/don-39-t-be-misled-by-deceptive-charity-efficiency-claims/147) and transparent in its activities than these numbers suggest.
1.6.5.1.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.
1.6.5.2. Con: -> See 1.6.1.
1.6.5.3. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.1.1.2.
1.6.5.4. Pro: Religious organizations constitute many of the [biggest](https://www.eternitynews.com.au/australia/four-of-australias-top-five-charities-are-christian/) charities.
1.6.6. Con: -> See 1.6.5.1.3.2.
1.6.7. Pro: Religious adoption and foster care agencies are an active and substantial part of the overburdened adoption and foster care field of USA. In 2009, agencies affiliated with Catholic Charities completed a total of 3,794 adoptions and Catholic agencies served 34,049 children and youths in the foster care system. \(Pluralism and Freedom, [pg.29](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=Tuy97nvRJXYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.6.8. Pro: According to [a study](http://www.people-press.org/2001/04/10/faith-based-funding-backed-but-church-state-doubts-abound/) conducted by the Pew Forum, the American public expresses strong support for the idea of faith-based groups receiving government funding to provide social services. 75% have an overall favorable opinion, 75% think that churches and other houses of worship contribute significantly to solving America’s social problems and 72% cite the care and compassion of religious workers as an important reason for supporting faith-based initiatives \(Kristine Schuerger, [pg.3](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/socwork/nrcfcpp/downloads/information_packets/faith_based_and_community_initiatives-pkt.pdf)\).
1.6.8.1. Con: [The study](http://www.people-press.org/2001/04/10/faith-based-funding-backed-but-church-state-doubts-abound/) also shows that the American public expresses strong support for the idea of faith-based groups receiving government funding with many reservations and does not want to extend this right to non Judeo-Christian religious groups including Muslims, Mormons, Buddhists, Scientology, etc. \(Kristine Schuerger. [pg.3\)](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/socwork/nrcfcpp/downloads/information_packets/faith_based_and_community_initiatives-pkt.pdf).
1.6.9. Con: Religious organisations do not provide a complete set of social services, often letting their religious beliefs come in the way of taking care of those they should assist.
1.6.9.1. Pro: The Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services is promulgated by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and sets forth [standards for the provision of care](https://www.aclu.org/issues/reproductive-freedom/religion-and-reproductive-rights/health-care-denied?redirect=feature/health-care-denied) at Catholic health care facilities. The Directives prohibit a range of reproductive health services, including contraception, sterilization, many infertility treatments, and abortion, even when a woman’s life or health is jeopardized by a pregnancy.
1.6.9.2. Con: Even if religious organizations provide only specific services, they may be provided more efficiently or effectively than other organizations can. That would be sufficient to justify funding religious organizations to provide those services.
1.6.10. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.6.11. Pro: Churches often [assist their congregations](https://www.citylab.com/life/2017/08/how-houses-of-worship-are-helping-immigrants-adapt-to-america/535992/) with everything from civic rights to the college application processes. They especially play an important role for recent immigrants who turn to churches for the services and information they need to adjust to life in a new country.
1.6.11.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.5.1.1.1.
1.6.11.2. Con: Individuals within a faith community should be encouraged to contribute to these faith-based initiatives. A lack of government funding does not prevent the existence of a religious group as a non-profit agent for good.
1.6.12. Pro: Religious motivation can be thought of as spiritual compensation that pays people to do work they would not otherwise do given the work's physical compensation.
1.6.13. Con: If a religious institution allows itself to take money from The State then it allows The State to exploit the good will of its believers; because much financially uncompensated work is done by the spiritually compensated faithful. If The State wishes to addressing social ills like poverty and addiction it should pay the full financial cost of doing so.
1.6.14. Pro: A University of Pennsylvania professor calculated the [economic benefit](http://www.pottsmerc.com/article/MP/20110226/LIFE01/302269951) of a dozen religious congregations in Philadelphia. The grand total for the 12 congregations was $50,577,098 in annual economic benefits. The research attached a price tag to [anything](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/religion/20110201_A_study_asks__What_s_a_church_s_economic_worth_.html) involving interaction with a congregation and considered a total of nearly five-dozen categories, including the money churches receive for performing funerals and weddings, salaries they pay their staff and the social values they promote.
1.6.14.1. Con: This is evidence of the current state of religious organisations which are already established. Other organisations could quite easily fulfil the same functions, possibly more efficiently.
1.6.15. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.7. Pro: The norms of many religious organizations are at odds with modern democratic norms. Funding these organizations runs the risk of seeming to endorse these norms.
1.7.1. Pro: Public funding for religious organizations can violate the principle of separation between church and state.
1.7.1.1. Pro: If the state and certain religious organisations become intertwined, then the state might begin giving preferential treatment to those religious organisations at the expense of others. This would violate the principle of free practice of religion.
1.7.1.2. Pro: If the state becomes influenced by religious organisations, this could allow those organisations to project their moral and political views onto the functioning of the state, which could cause the state to inherit the often bigoted and regressive moral views promoted by religions.
1.7.1.3. Con: There are certain conditions, like [limitations on political activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501\(c\)\(3\)_organization#Limitations_on_political_activity), that have to be met in order to maintain a tax exempt status. Such conditions and limitations ensure separation of church and state.
1.7.1.3.1. Con: Religious organizations being able to advocate for political candidates is a good thing.
1.7.1.3.1.1. Con: Allowing religious organizations to advocate for political candidates while also allowing religions to receive public funding creates a vicious cycle where religions benefit from [rent seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking) behaviors.
1.7.1.3.1.2. Pro: Leaders and employees of other entities that receive federal funding in countries like the United States,  such as hospitals and universities, are welcome to advocate for political causes and contribute to them. As registered non-profits, religious organizations should enjoy the same freedoms.
1.7.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Religious influence is unlike any other since a religious organization can wave the fear of God over its congregation. As such, its influence in the political process is greater than any other non-profit. This creates a circumstance where speech may have to be restricted to create open and fair elections.
1.7.1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: In many religions, religious leaders have sole interpretive power over the word of god. As such religious followers must vote in the way their religious leaders indicate should they wish to practice their religion.
1.7.1.3.1.3. Pro: This kind of advocacy allows minority religions to voice their concerns more effectively in a world where they otherwise may not be represented - since there are structural barriers that prevent the congregation from participating in the political process.
1.7.1.3.1.4. Pro: Religious people should be able to seek advice from their religious leaders to determine which political candidates best align with their ideology.
1.7.1.3.2. Pro: In [the USA](https://www.gosanangelo.com/story/opinion/contributors/2017/02/15/tax-exemption-gives-government-control-over-churches/97571818/), churches and charitable organizations are unable to directly or indirectly participate in any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any candidate because of their tax-exempt status. Specifically, ministers are restricted from endorsing or opposing candidates from the pulpit.
1.7.2. Pro: A majority of people in liberal democracies do not want the state to fund religious organisations; governments should respect their wishes.
1.7.2.1. Pro: The majority of the populace in Greece, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and the Czech Republic [do not support](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/views-on-religion-and-politics/pf-05-10-2017_ce-europe-04-01/) funding for the country's dominant church or other religious groups.
1.7.2.2. Pro: [A survey by Opinium](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/14/taxpayers-should-not-fund-faith-schools) for The Observer shows that 58% of voters in Britain believe faith schools, which can give priority to applications from pupils of their faith and are free to teach only about their own religion, should not be funded by the state or should be abolished. Fewer than one in three \(30%\) said they had no objections to faith schools being funded by the state.
1.7.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.7.2.4. Pro: People in [Orthodox countries](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/views-on-religion-and-politics/pf-05-10-2017_ce-europe-04-01/) only favor state funding for the main religious denomination in their country \(in many cases the national Orthodox church\), and fewer than half in most cases support government funding for other religious groups.
1.7.2.5. Con: -> See 1.6.8.
1.7.3. Con: The norms of religious organizations may be at odds with secular organizations, but this is not synonymous with democracy. It is possible to be a modern democracy that is also religious.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Many democratic nations have state religions [including](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_democracy) the UK, Denmark, Israel and Pakistan.
1.7.3.2. Con: Religious democracies are notoriously slow in accepting and enforcing laws that challenge the broad legal and societal principles that the state religion dictates. This can often infringe on the rights of religious minorities living in those states, making them ineffective as democracies.
1.7.4. Pro: [Many religions](https://religionnews.com/2015/06/30/ranking-churches-on-acceptance-of-homosexuality-plus-their-reactions-to-scotus-ruling/) believe homosexuality is a sin.
1.7.4.1. Con: Claiming that differences between the ethics of a particular religion and the country it is embedded in are a reason to deny funding to religious organizations won't work as a general argument because in many countries those belief systems might line up.
1.7.4.1.1. Pro: Based on this argument, in a Christian-led country, like Hungary, stopping the public funding of civil organisations which support non-Christian ideas would be acceptable.
1.7.4.1.1.1. Con: In fact, those who claim any form of Christian identity in Hungary only enjoy a narrow [majority](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/religious-beliefs-in-hungary.html) and non-religiosity is on the rise. It is thus odd to simply regard Hungarian democratic norms as uncontroversially aligned with Christian norms.
1.7.4.1.1.2. Con: It would be just as easy to regard legislation that imposes the moral religious code of one group \(even the dominant group\) of a state on the whole population as evidence that religious norm erosion is already taking place. Indeed, the fact that anti-homosexual norms were relaxed under [communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_under_communism#Hungary) \(when Christianity was banned from having an influence on the state\) and under [secular post-communist parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Hungary) prior to being restricted by the Orban regime, suggest that this is the case.
1.7.4.2. Pro: Many heterosexual people feel a literal and immediate sense of repulsion when they see displays of homosexual affection. The natural reaction is to push such negative stimuli away, and label everything that produces that stimuli as negative/bad/...etc.
1.7.5. Con: Norms are dynamic and change over time. The government can use tax breaks to give religions financial incentives to make their norms more progressive.
1.7.5.1. Pro: The presence of a formal relationship between the state and religious groups encourages those religious groups to evolve in tandem with the state. If religious organisations become totally disconnected from the state's secular norms, then extremism is encouraged.
1.7.5.2. Con: The state should wait for religious organisations to adopt progressive social norms, and only then should it consider giving them tax exemptions. It should not give them exemptions in the hope that eventually they will change.
1.7.5.2.1. Con: Providing different levels of funding to religious organizations on the basis of their specific beliefs is a violation of the separation of church and state.
1.7.5.2.2. Con: Governments use incentives to alter the behaviour of groups all the time, it is unclear why religious organizations should be any different.
1.7.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.1.
1.7.5.4. Con: On the other hand, socially conservative governments could have the exact opposite effect - incentivizing religious organizations to become more regressive in their actions.
1.7.5.5. Con: -> See 1.7.5.2.1.
1.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
