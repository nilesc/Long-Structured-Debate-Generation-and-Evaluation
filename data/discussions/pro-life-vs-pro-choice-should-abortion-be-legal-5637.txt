Discussion Title: Pro-Life vs Pro-Choice: Should Abortion be Legal?

1. Women should have the right to choose abortion.
1.1. Con: Adoption is a viable alternative to abortion.
1.1.1. Con: Adoption is unlikely to be a feasible alternative unless the state intervenes to raise the demand for adopted children, for example by paying surrogate mothers.
1.1.1.1. Con: Maybe they should be. This is not an argument in favour of, or against abortion.
1.1.1.2. Con: In Brazil, for instance, [for every child available for adoption there are 6 families in the adoption queue](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil/2016/05/160509_adocao_criancas_ab). And 84% of the families are looking for children up to 5 years old. Interested families largely outnumber the children to be adopted.
1.1.2. Con: Telling a woman who wants to have an abortion, that they should consider adoption instead, is wrong. It pressures women to undergo the physically difficult and risky process of pregnancy and child birth against their will.
1.1.2.1. Con: Women should be properly informed about all options available to them with regards to their pregnancy. Informing women about adoption potential is not forcing a women to carry the child against her will. True and complete information is necessary to make the right choice for everyone.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Adoption is not a suitable option for all women. Many may not want to mother a child and then give it up.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: A woman who is uncomfortable giving her child up for adoption is probably likely to feel uncomfortable having an abortion.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Woman may feel emotionally attached to their child if they are forced to carry it to term. It is coercive to force a woman to choose between her mental and economic well being.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Pregnancy and childbirth are gruelling and have huge and varying impacts on women's physical and mental wellbeing. Therefore it is wrong to prevent women from seeking abortions.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: The existence of a possible remedy does not place an automatic moral mandate on society to allow that specific remedy.
1.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: In many countries, it is illegal to purchase certain street drugs even if they are taken to relieve physical or emotional pain.
1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Many countries regulate the usage of medicinal drugs, such as requiring a physician's prescription or not allowing new drugs to be sold without approval, even if it means that some citizens cannot then access helpful drugs.
1.1.2.3.1.3. Pro: A worker in a hard and grueling job is not allowed to kill his boss, though he may seek other remedies that are legally allowed.
1.1.2.3.1.4. Pro: Suicide is illegal, yet it has the same justification of alleviating pain. Abortion likewise is very much a permanent solution to temporary problems and/or obstacles. Obstacles not unlike what we all face everyday in life.
1.1.2.3.1.5. Con: By default, everything is allowed. Disallowing something should only be done with good reason. The burden of proof is on the person providing such reasons.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: Female human bodies are specifically designed to bear children.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: While female bodies may be designed to bear children, this does not undermine the significant burden this can be for women given the many symptoms they can experience as a result of pregnancy, such as nausea and exhaustion.
1.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: While the changes and potential harms that come with pregnancy and childbirth are natural and unintentional, all abortions include a volitional aspect. People mitigate the suffering of childbirth medically; nobody goes into an abortion hoping the child comes out alive.
1.1.2.3.2.3. Con: Even if the female body is "designed for" childbirth \(although you could make the argument that they're also "designed for" a lot of other things that we don't consider obligatory\), not all females are equipped for child rearing, which is generally the reason for wanting an abortion to begin with.
1.1.2.3.2.3.1. Pro: Not all women are equipped to bring a baby into the world. The UN Population Fund estimated that 289,000 women died during pregnancy in 2013. Conditions such as [HIV/AIDS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4302331/), and cardiovascular disease can complicate pregnancy and increase the risk of maternal death.
1.1.2.3.2.3.1.1. Con: In these instances it is possible to make exceptions to the law without outright making abortion a legal choice.
1.1.2.3.2.3.1.1.1. Con: It would be cruel to require a victim of rape to justify their right to abortion.
1.1.2.3.2.3.1.1.2. Con: Legal processes are too long so the abortion may not be safe anymore or may not happen at all.
1.1.2.3.2.3.1.1.3. Con: Enforcing laws and drawing lines between what is legal and illegal is often a long process, prone to mistakes. Abortion is a time-delicate matter which cannot be postponed for next hearing.
1.1.2.3.2.4. Con: Women can decide for themselves what their body is made for.
1.1.2.3.2.4.1. Con: Women can decide what their body is used for, however there is no doubt that one of the functions they are made for is childbearing.
1.1.2.3.2.5. Con: Although the claim offers encouraging words to pregnant women, if women's bodies were specifically designed for childbirth, it would be painless to give birth and there would be no medical complications.
1.1.2.3.2.6. Con: A woman cannot be forced to be a mother, even if she is biologically "designed" to bear children, it does not mean she must have them. A pregnancy has effects on the woman's body that she shouldn't have to go through unwillingly.
1.1.2.3.2.7. Con: Female bodies are not designed.
1.1.2.3.3. Pro: The hormonal and psychological shifts that occur during pregnancy put some women at an increased risk for [mental illnesses](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/18/pregnancy-affects-mental-health_n_6343186.html), such as anxiety and depression.
1.1.2.3.3.1. Pro: [Many women](http://postpartumprogress.org/the-facts-about-postpartum-depression/) suffer from postpartum depression.
1.1.2.3.3.1.1. Con: Many women who have abortions suffer a lifetime of [depression and guilt](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/199/3/180) as a result of terminating their pregnancies.
1.1.2.3.3.1.1.1. Con: 95% of women who have had abortions do not regret their decision to terminate their [pregnancies](http://time.com/3956781/women-abortion-regret-reproductive-health/).
1.1.2.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: This 95% statistic is based on one study and biased reporting. Here is an [article](http://www.iowartl.org/get-the-facts/abortion/post-abortion-syndrome/) that shows 40 to 60% have negative reactions and 31% regret it.
1.1.2.3.3.1.1.2. Con: US [researchers](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/health/abortion-mental-health.html) followed nearly 1,000 women who sought abortions nationwide for five years and found that those who had abortions did not experience more depression, anxiety, low self-esteem or dissatisfaction with life than those who were denied it.
1.1.2.3.3.1.2. Pro: This is [especially true in women](http://www.postpartumprogress.com/postpartum-depression-risk-factors-2) who miscarry or in cases where the child is stillborn or has such a severe illness that it does not live for very long.
1.1.2.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: Depression after a [miscarriage](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/miscarriage-depression#2) is usually most severe immediately after a pregnancy is lost. In one study, researchers discovered that after a year, women who had a miscarriage experienced rates of depression similar to those of women who didn’t have a miscarriage.
1.1.2.3.3.1.2.2. Con: If a stillborn child or child that doesn't live for very long causes an increased risk of depression, then a child terminated in the womb would cause an even greater increase of risk of depression. A [study](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/199/3/180) in the British Journal of Psychiatry found that women had a 37% higher risk of depression due to abortion compared to term birth. Stillbirth only has an [11%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC31099/) higher depression risk compared to term birth and it declines over time.
1.1.2.3.3.1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.3.1.1.2.
1.1.2.3.3.1.2.3. Con: A miscarriage or stillborn baby is 100% dead \(or non-living, depending on your view\). If a mother fears for this outcome of their fetus, an abortion should also be feared because it confirms the death of the fetus. However, if the mother chooses not to have an abortion, the chances of the fetus surviving birth is non-zero.
1.1.2.3.3.1.3. Con: Society doesn't give depressed mothers the right to kill their infants or toddlers, so depression in and of itself is not an ethically justifiable reason to terminate life.
1.1.2.3.3.1.3.1. Con: [Postpartum depression](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/post-natal-depression/) affects 1 in 10 women, and is especially common in circumstances where the mother has a history of mental health problems. As depression is a serious and potentially life-threatening mental illness, these concerns can be a fair and legitimate factor when deciding whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.
1.1.2.3.3.1.3.1.1. Con: While postpartum depression is common, the risk of self-harm comes from [postpartum psychosis](https://familydoctor.org/condition/postpartum-depression/) which is more rare. The postpartum suicide rate is less than 2 out of every 100,000 births. This is [around the same risk](http://www.postpartumprogress.com/pregnancy-and-suicide) as the mother dying from hemorrhage/placenta previa or eclampsia/pre-eclampsia.
1.1.2.3.3.1.3.1.2. Con: [Screening questionnaires](http://www.postpartum.net/learn-more/screening/), [doctor follow-ups](https://familydoctor.org/condition/postpartum-depression/), and [local resources](http://www.postpartum.net/get-help/locations/) greatly mitigate the risks of a women with postpartum psychosis committing suicide.
1.1.2.3.3.1.3.1.3. Con: As society does not consider it morally permissible to allow mothers with known depression to kill their infant children, it would be even less morally permissible for a mother to kill an unborn child on the sole basis of potential future depression.
1.1.2.3.3.1.4. Con: Depression is only a possible post-birth complication, not a guaranteed outcome.
1.1.2.3.3.2. Con: Abortion puts the fetus at an increased risk for death \(that is the whole goal of an abortion\) and death is more severe than anxiety or depression.
1.1.2.3.3.3. Con: Raising a baby may increase those risks too but we don't think it is a valid argument to abandon or kill offspring. Moreover, the right to life is more important than a mental ilness because a mental illness of this kind is most surely reversible; death, unfortunately, is not.
1.1.2.3.4. Pro: Women's bodies change significantly as a result of pregnancy. Many women feel less attractive because of the stretch marks and weight gain.
1.1.2.3.4.1. Con: While pregnancy can take a toll on the body, the woman can work to minimize this and recover to some degree. The changes themselves are mostly cosmetic. Conversely, the terminated human life can never recover, and the changes to his/her body are literally life-altering.
1.1.2.3.4.2. Con: Stretch marks and other temporary blemishes are not sufficient justification for terminating a pregnancy because they can be remedied with other less severe methods than abortion.
1.1.2.3.4.3. Con: That is a cultural argument. In some countries those same 'defects' are seen as badges of honor, strength and beauty. Along those same lines, we should be able to dispose of anyone who makes us feel less than attractive.
1.1.2.3.5. Pro: [Pregnancy symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregcomplications.htm) can be severe and can involve life-threatening illnesses.
1.1.2.3.5.1. Pro: In instances where the pregnant woman's life is at risk, she should be able to choose to have an abortion to save her own life.
1.1.2.3.5.1.1. Con: When the mother's life becomes medically threatened there is always the option to end the pregnancy with birth. Even without abortion factoring in, many babies survive premature birth. A life threatening situation of a pregnant mother could end in 2 deaths, 1 death and 1 living patient, or 2 living patients. Situations that require choosing death for a baby to save the mother are very rare.
1.1.2.3.5.1.1.1. Con: "There is always the option to end the pregnancy with birth" is a completely false statement. Medical practice does not generally allow inducing labor at any point for any reason. In some cases, inducing birth is actually the dangerous part. In some cases, the baby is far too premature for inducing birth to be any different than aborting it.
1.1.2.3.5.1.2. Con: While a life-threatening condition is a valid reason to seek an abortion, this is a specific case that does not legitimize a generalized right for women to choose abortion.
1.1.2.3.5.1.3. Pro: Even the Catholic church recognizes that if the life of an unborn baby is lost in the course of treatment which could save the life of the mother, this is not murder. It is not an intentional, unnecessary killing of the baby, it is an unfortunate and unintended side effect of saving the life of the mother.
1.1.2.3.5.1.4. Con: Having an abortion for medical reasons makes up [less than 1%](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html) of all abortions, even lower when the "life of the mother" is in jeopardy. The utilitarian justification for abortion is therefore very, very small.
1.1.2.3.5.1.4.1. Pro: It is reasonable to give priority to the mother over the child in extreme cases. However, this does not make voluntary abortions acceptable.
1.1.2.3.5.1.4.2. Con: The amount something happens doesn't always make it less important - it only takes one. If you, or someone else, were in that 1%, you would likely disagree.
1.1.2.3.5.1.4.3. Con: "Less than 1% of all abortions" could be misleading because if between 1970 and 2014, there were "44.5[million legal induced abortions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_statistics_in_the_United_States)", then there could be 445k abortions that fall in this category. That would be a significant impact to a lot of people.
1.1.2.3.5.1.4.4. Pro: Statistics regarding the number of abortions due to endangerment of mother's life back this up.[Florida](https://ahca.myflorida.com/MCHQ/Central_Services/Training_Support/docs/ReasonGestation_2015.pdf), 2015: 0.065%. [UK](https://davidalton.net/2012/07/21/latest-abortion-figures-6-3-million-abortions-143-where-a-womans-life-was-in-danger/),1968-2011: 0.006%. [U.S.](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html#8) estimate: 1%.
1.1.2.3.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.3.1.1.
1.1.2.3.5.3. Pro: The symptoms, when inflicted upon a woman without her choice, are akin to torture.
1.1.2.3.6. Pro: Abortion has [less physical impact](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049386715001589?via%3Dihub) on the woman than pregnancy does.
1.1.2.3.6.1. Pro: The most common side effects of [abortion](http://americanpregnancy.org/unplanned-pregnancy/abortion-side-effects/) are abdominal pain and cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, spotting and bleeding. They usually go away after a couple of weeks \(if they occur at all\). The common side effects of pregnancy tend to be more severe and usually last for months.
1.1.2.3.6.2. Pro: Generally speaking, abortions do not have a long-term impact on the body, and do not affect future [fertility](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/abortion/risks/).
1.1.2.3.6.3. Con: In rare cases, abortions can cause dangerous and potentially life-threatening [complications](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/abortion/risks/), such as infection of the womb, some of the pregnancy remaining in the womb, continuation of the pregnancy, excessive bleeding, damage to the cervix, or damage to the womb.
1.1.2.3.6.4. Pro: People who get abortions are less likely to have complications than people who have their [wisdom teeth](http://time.com/3623572/abortion-safe-complications/) removed.
1.1.2.3.6.5. Con: The overall mental hardships of pregnancy on a woman are not as [severe](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/abortion-and-mental-health-quantitative-synthesis-and-analysis-of-research-published-19952009/E8D556AAE1C1D2F0F8B060B28BEE6C3D) as that of going through an abortion, so mental hardship cannot be a reason to prefer abortion over pregnancy.
1.1.2.3.6.5.1. Con: The mental hardships of pregnancy and the mental hardships of abortion are different for different people. Thus, women should be able to choose, based on their own needs
1.1.2.3.6.5.2. Pro: A 2003 [study](https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00006254-200301000-00023) found an increased risk of preterm delivery and mood disorders, such as depression, in women with previous abortions as compared to women who had not had previous abortions.
1.1.2.3.6.5.3. Pro: A 2007 [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.02040.x) found that women who aborted had an increased risk of later substance abuse or dependance than women who gave birth.
1.1.2.3.6.5.4. Pro: A [study](http://A study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry found that women who aborted had an 81% increased risk of mental disorders due to abortion, with 10% of that risk able to be directly related to the effects of abortion as compared to women who went to term and the other 71% correlative.) published in the British Journal of Psychiatry found that women who aborted had an 81% increased risk of mental disorders due to abortion, with 10% of that risk able to be directly related to the effects of abortion as compared to women who went to term and the other 71% correlative.
1.1.2.3.6.5.4.1. Con: There are fundamental issues with the validity of this study. For example, the researcher does not distinguish between mental health outcomes that occurred before abortions and those that occurred afterward, but still claimed to show a causal link between abortion and mental disorders. Additionally, several researchers and the editor of the Journal found that there were [serious issues](https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2012/study-purporting-show-link-between-abortion-and-mental-health-outcomes-decisively) with methodology and analysis.
1.1.2.3.6.5.4.2. Con: Negative emotional and psychological experiences after abortion are often linked to the individual's [own views](http://americanpregnancy.org/unplanned-pregnancy/abortion-emotional-effects/) about whether a fetus is a life from the point of conception. This suggests that people will have very different reactions to abortion depending on their beliefs, and reaffirms the view that it is therefore best for women determine the right choice for them.
1.1.2.3.6.5.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.3.1.1.2.
1.1.2.3.6.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.3.1.1.2.
1.1.2.3.7. Con: This argues for using lethal force \(abortion\) to prevent an impact to physical or mental wellbeing, i.e. self-defense. However, self-defense justifications for the use of lethal force requires certain or immediate threat to the person's life or major bodily harm. Very few pregnancies in developed countries threaten a woman's life or threaten major bodily harm. Therefore, the effects of the vast majority of pregnancy are insufficient to justify taking an innocent human life.
1.1.2.3.7.1. Con: This point rests completely upon the assumption that life begins at conception, which is in-and-of-itself a debatable concept.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1. Con: Biology textbooks are consistent that the lifecycle of a genetically distinct human organism begins at conception.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.1. Con: The majority of biology textbooks used to use creationism to describe the world's history and omitted evolution. The fact that biology textbooks are consistent in how they describe conception is not a reason we should believe in that description.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Does this argument imply that we get to choose which facts from biology textbooks we accept and which we do not accept arbitrary? Or that we should discard biology textbooks from education altogeter? 
Education textbooks indeed had some flaws, but those were discarded only after they were proven wrong. So in order to claim that some fact from biology \(or any other scientific\) textbook is wrong, it is first required that scientific community proves it wrong. That is not the case with conception.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.2. Pro: A living human organism [develops through stages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_\(biology\)), but is not biologically less or more a human organism at any stage. Some of the various stages are zygote, blastula, embryo, fetus, neonate, infant, adolescent, and adult.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.3. Pro: "The human life cycle begins at fertilization, when an egg cell inside a woman and a sperm cell from a man fuse to form a one-celled zygote" [www.biologyreference.com](http://www.biologyreference.com/La-Ma/Life-Cycle-Human.html)
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.4. Pro: Some quotes from Embryology textbooks have even made their way into the U.S. congressional record on this matter. [books.google.com](https://books.google.com/books?id=W6gziQydtBwC&lpg=PA197&ots=T-W4FAJT-h&dq=Although%20life%20is%20a%20continuous%20process%2C%20fertilization%20is%20a%20critical%20landmark%20because%2C%20under%20ordinary%20circumstances%2C%20a%20new%2C%20genetically%20distinct%20human%20organism%20is%20thereby%20formed.&pg=PA197#v=onepage&q=Although%20life%20is%20a%20continuous%20process%2C%20fertilization%20is%20a%20critical%20landmark%20because%2C%20under%20ordinary%20circumstances%2C%20a%20new%2C%20genetically%20distinct%20human%20organism%20is%20thereby%20formed.&f=false)
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.5. Pro: The fetus has a separate blood type and it is its own separate being from the mother. It shouldn't be the mothers choice to kill it if it is a separate being.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.5.1. Con: The fetus can not be considered a distinct, separate being from the mother - since it is unable to survive without the mother's body supporting it.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.5.1.1. Con: A fetus can be considered a separate being from the mother. As a parasite is, though it is reliant on a host for nutrients.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.5.1.2. Con: Premature babies live all the time. We are [getting better](https://www.wnyc.org/radio/#/ondemand/586996) at keeping them alive outside the womb.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: The premature baby used as an example was born roughly 24 weeks into the pregnancy which is also the latest time for a surgical abortion to be performed. States already stop abortions after 24 weeks as from then on it's considered an “intent to murder.”
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.5.1.3. Con: A newborn infant cannot survive on its own without the mother either, that does not mean it is not a distinct and separate being. It is both distinct and separate.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.5.1.3.1. Con: A newborn infant can easily survive without the mother. All it takes is someone else to take care. The fetus can not.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.5.1.4. Con: Distinctiveness does not depend on an organism's ability to survive. The child is distinct because it is possible for its life to end while the mother's continues and vice versa.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.5.2. Con: Killing distinct living things is not murder. Eating salad kills distinct living things. Unlawfully killing a person is murder. The issue is whether a fetus is a person, and whether there is any lawful basis for killing the fetus.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.6. Con: Tadpoles are the beginning of the frog lifecycle. They are still not frogs any more than caterpillars are butterflies or blastocysts are human.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.6.1. Con: Actually [frogspawn](http://www.kidzone.ws/lw/frogs/facts3.htm) is the beginning of the frog lifecycle. And by this kind of thinking, you could argue that a child shouldn't be considered human because it hasn't grown into an adult yet.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.7.1.1.2.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.6.2. Con: They would still have the same DNA as a frog, which makes them a frog.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.6.3. Con: The science of embryology directly falsifies this claim.  Natural, developmental changes in the outward appearance of a living organism - even dramatic changes like with the butterfly - do not produce a different kind of organism.  [According to modern embryology](http://naapc.org/why-life-begins-at-conception/), a zygote is a distinct, living, and whole human being.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7. Con: Being a biological human being is legally and morally distinct from being a person with the rights and responsibilities ascribed to legal [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood).
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.1. Con: This is a matter of public vote, not moral or scientific fact. So it’s somewhat cyclical to offer this as a pro-choice argument. The point at which we deem something alive is probably the most important point in the discussion of whether that thing should receive rights.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.1.1. Con: The biological definition of "life" serves a scientific purpose, and does not bestow any philosophical value on an object unless people decide that it does. Even if the deciding factor is deeming the fetus "alive", it will be a separate debate from what biologists consider useful to label as "alive".
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.1.2. Con: The public should not arbitrarily decide via a vote what is, and is not a life. They are often not qualified to do so. Scientists are qualified to do so, their expertise should not be dismissed in order to appease uninformed citizens.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2. Pro: A fetus does not have a 'right to life' as it does not qualify for the status of '[personhood](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/a-moral-case-for-abortion/18826#.Whn73Upl86w).'
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.1. Pro: Fetuses are yet to become citizens of the state since they are unborn and therefore have no rights or protection under common law.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.1.1. Con: The debate is about matters of right and wrong, not what is or is not permitted under some particular legal tradition \(e.g. the common law\).
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.1.2. Con: Citizenship is irrelevant to the legality \(and the morality\) of the act. Non-citizens enjoy the protection of the law just as much as citizens do. It is not legal to kill a non-citizen any more than it is to kill a citizen.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.2. Con: In 1857, the U.S. Supreme Court declared in [Dred Scott v. Sandford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford) that blacks were 'not persons' and therefore didn't have the rights of people. One group declaring that they don't consider another group of humans to be people is not a valid ethical excuse for stripping a group of humans of their natural rights.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.2.1. Con: Dred Scott v. Sandford had nothing to do with black slaves not being "persons", it ruled that black slaves were not American citizens, or the citizens or subjects of any other nation and therefore the Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction. Dredd Scott is not a good argument against abortion.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.2.1.1. Con: Dred Scott claimed a lot more than blacks merely being 'non-citizens'. It declared all African Americans as being outside the class of persons to which the human rights in the constitution applied to. [This and other arguments](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/60/393/case.html) that blacks had no fundamental rights fed into the court's conclusion that blacks were non-citizens.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.3. Con: There is no generally accepted definition of "personhood", but this argument hinges on one particular definition.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.4. Con: Under Kantian ethics, on which the common basis for the pro-abortion personhood argument is based, it isn't just the unborn who are not people - it is anyone who cannot defend their personhood at the moment: infants, the unconscious, the asleep, the mentally infirmed, etc. Lack of personhood under this ethical system is not a valid reason to deprive a perceived non-person of life.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.4.1. Con: The pro-abortion personhood argument is not dependent upon the Kantian definition of personhood even if that is its philosophical origin. It is the capacity of [sentience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience) which defines personhood, not its ability to defend its personhood in the moment.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.4.1.1. Con: The birth canal doesn't magically  give a baby sentience. It must be developed in the [womb](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/books/chapters/the-ethical-brain.html?referer=http://www.google.com/).
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.5. Con: This is an "is/ought" fallacy. It is clear that a fetus "is" not granted basic human rights \(life, liberty, property\), but that does not mean that a fetus "ought" not be granted basic human rights.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.6. Pro: Rights apply to persons. The essence of a person is emotion and motives/preferences/desires. Until a fetus reaches a stage in which those qualities arise; it is not a person and therefore does not have rights.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.6.1. Con: A person in a coma has rights. Unless the line is drawn at conception, the argument to allow abortion can also be applied to other living people.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.7. Con: Whether or not a human fits the criteria of sentient "personhood" is immaterial with regard to it's rights. A human in comatose may temporarily lose the characteristics that constitute personhood. Pulling the plug on their life support and killing them is still considered immoral if they're is a chance that they may regain sentience. Hence a foetus with a potential for sentience should not be stripped of the rights of a person when these characteristics are absent in the early gestational stage.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.8. Pro: Unborn and very young children are not yet "persons" in the philosophical sense, and do not have the ability to express preferences that makes us persons, so are morally owed the same rights as an animal, and the preferences of the mother should be given precedence.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.8.1. Con: Many people consider very young children to be "persons". In the U.S., very young children have legal rights. Killing very young children is typically [a capital offense](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111) while killing animals is not.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.9. Con: If we all share equal human rights, they must be based on something that we share equally, not something that some have more than others.  If you try to base rights on an ability \(e.g. self-awareness\) then you will include animals, exclude newborns, or both. The only thing that works to define human rights is our humanity. Each of us began our lives at fertilization. Whether a child is killed at 8 weeks or 8 months or 8 years, a unique, never-to-be-duplicated individual person is dead.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.10. Con: Personhood is an unproven philosophical concept. People determine the personhood of others based ultimately on subjective reasoning. Therefore, no real judgment can be made about the 'personhood' \(whether personhood even exists or not\) of the fetus.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.11. Con: They way we conceive of personhood as a rights bearing attribute, has to do with how humans have higher level thought and complex emotions which distinguish us from other life. Nevertheless, babies are also incapable of higher level thought and complex emotions, yet societies generally consider infanticide to be wrong because children grow up.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.11.1. Con: A fertility clinic is burning down. You grab a fire extinguisher and battle your way into the only open room. You see a large storage container with 1,000 fertilized eggs. Next to the container is a small child passed out from smoke inhalation. Most people's priority would be saving the 1 child over the 1,000 fertilized eggs. This shows that not all life is considered equal.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.11.1.1. Con: The issue with the fertility clinic analogy is that it's an emotional argument more than a rational one. Let's modify it this way: Your house is burning down and you have time only to take the fire extinguisher, enter a single room and save the people there, the rest can't be saved. There are two adults in one room, and in another there's your child \(you don't know who the adults are\). Most people would rather save their own child. None of those two intuitions solve the moral problem.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.11.1.2. Con: This is nothing like what happens in real life. It isn't normally a choice between 1,000 fertilized eggs and a small child. What actually happens is doctors kill one fetus at a time resulting in thousands being aborted without saving anyone's life. Even if the child's life is more valuable, it doesn't mean a fertilized egg or a fetus has no value and doesn't justify [abortion](https://www.dailywire.com/news/22360/pro-abortion-fanatic-presented-thought-experiment-ben-shapiro).
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.11.2. Con: Society can take responsibility for an abandoned infant, but it cannot take responsibility for a fetus. It's opinion has more relevance to the issue of infanticide than to abortion.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.11.3. Con: Infanticide provokes strong moral outrage for evolutionary reasons, not because children grow up. Killing children provokes greater outrage than killing adults because we are programmed to aggressively defend our children.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12. Pro: A [fetus](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/a-moral-case-for-abortion/18826) is not self aware, or conscious, or able to feel pain.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.1. Con: Neither are people who are asleep. Both being a fetus and being asleep are only true temporarily.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.1.1. Con: People who are asleep can feel pain, making them distinct from fetuses.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.2. Con: Recent [studies](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/37/15145) have shown that language acquisition begins in the 3rd trimester. This would indicate that the late term fetus is both aware and able to form memories prior to birth.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.3. Con: A fetus develops during the gestational period such that it does gain self-awareness, consciousness and the ability to feel pain. Therefore it can still be argued it should qualify for personhood status while still in utero.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.3.1. Con: While it is true that a fetus develops sentience in utero, it does not have sentience from the moment of conception. Therefore, a fetus should not be considered a person prior to the development of sentience which roughly coincides with the beginning of the 2nd trimester.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.3.2. Pro: A fetus develops the capacity for self-awareness, and consciousness around the beginning of the 2nd trimester of pregnancy. Therefore, the beginning of the 2nd trimester is when a fetus with a normally developing brain should be regarded as having the unalienable right to life.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.3.3. Pro: The fetal stage of human development is about 8-40 weeks from conception - two months until birth. The fetus has pain receptors present at 8 weeks, and observation shows the fetus 'responds' to painful stimuli in the same way adults do by 20 weeks. Cortical function is present by 30 weeks. While the exact beginning of pain sensation in a fetus is as-yet unknown, a human [can experience pain](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/845410) long before the fetal period is over.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.3.4. Con: Many non-human animals have cognitive capacities well beyond those of a fetus. These capacities are not typically taken to be sufficient for a right to life, in the case of animals, it is unclear why they ought to be sufficient in the case of fetuses.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.3.4.1. Pro: If we follow this line of argument, all pro-life supporters should abstain from eating meat, yet this is not the case.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.3.4.2. Con: It's very clear why cognitive capacities are sufficient for a fetus and not sufficient for an animal. A fetus is a human and an animal is not. Human rights are not the same as animal rights. Animals do have some rights. For example, you can't torture your dog. However, a "right to life" is not among animal rights. You can euthanize your dog.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.4. Con: A fetus has potentiality of these attributes, it will develop them naturally. Future people have rights.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.5. Con: The referenced material is very far from being the unanimous definition of personhood.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.5.1. Pro: Personhood is a variable concept depending on one's personal philosophy, and so should not be used as a benchmark for assigning value to human life.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.6. Con: Consciousness shouldn't be a declaration of whether someone has rights or not, people in a coma or people in an alive but unconscious state aren't disqualified as human or having less rights simply because they are not aware.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.6.1. Con: It is always considered wrong to end the life of a healthy human being. It is not always considered wrong to end the life of someone who is in a coma.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.6.1.1. Con: Some people do in fact always consider it wrong to end the life of someone who is in a coma.  As long as the patient isn't brain dead \(i.e. "dead"\) then it's wrong to pull the plug.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.6.2. Con: There is a distinction between violating someone’s rights, and never instilling them in the first place. Constitutional rights are assigned at citizenship, which takes place around birth. Moral rights are subjective, as moral values may differ from person to person. Freedom from having one’s life ended by another is not an absolute right outside of these two, because honoring an advanced directive by pulling the plug of a terminal patient remains an accepted option.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.6.2.1. Con: It is illegal to kill a citizen and illegal to kill a tourist.  Just because the victim doesn't have citizenship, doesn't mean the victim doesn't have rights. Our rights are not "instilled" by the Constitution. Our rights are acknowledged by the Constitution. Human rights are inalienable. They cannot be repealed or restrained by human laws.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.6.2.2. Con: "Honoring an advanced directive" implies voluntary euthanasia which would be consistent with self-determination, self-ownership and human rights. It is not an example of involuntarily having one's life ended by another so it is not comparable to abortion.
1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.7. Con: We do not have a rational, unambiguous definition or even description of "Self awareness" or "Consciousness". The more we learn about other animals the less unique humans appear. Any such definition must include intelligent, non-human animals or exclude young human children.
1.1.2.3.7.2. Pro: You can't terminate a life because the the individual needs care and provides an unwanted burden. Otherwise nursing homes and hospitals would be killing all patients.
1.1.2.3.7.3. Con: Abortion of a non-person is not comparable with self-defence against a person.
1.1.2.3.8. Con: Nursing an infant is gruelling and takes a huge toll on the body, yet society doesn't treat that as an ethical excuse for the mother to kill the infant.
1.1.2.3.8.1. Con: The situations are not comparable. A nursing mother can relinquish her parental rights without killing the infant by giving the child to another adult or to the state to raise with the help of infant formula or a wet nurse. It is not exclusively dependent on the mother to remain alive. Until scientists are able to develop an artificial womb, a pre-viable fetus is exclusively dependent on its mother and cannot be handed off to others.
1.1.2.3.8.1.1. Con: A pregnant mother can also relinquish her parental rights without killing the infant by transferring custody to another adult or to the state. Short of abandoning a child, it is generally [faster](https://adoptionnetwork.com/can-i-decide-to-place-my-baby-for-adoption-after-i-give-birth) and [easier](http://www.americanadoptions.com/pregnant/putting_an_older_child_up_for_adoption) for a pregnant woman to do so than it is for a mother of an infant or small child to transfer custody later on.
1.1.2.3.9. Con: The gruelling aspect of pregnancy and childbirth applies equally to planned and unplanned instances. The claim implies that the basis for wanting an abortion is that childbirth is a painful experience. There are less severe methods for alleviating the discomfort.
1.1.2.3.10. Con: The individual hardship does not outweigh the societal benefit of contributing to the physical and social growth of the human race.
1.1.2.3.10.1. Pro: Many children consider school to be mentally and emotionally gruelling, and physical education to be sometimes physically gruelling as well. Yet because the benefit to society is greater than the individual hardship, society still demands that all children be schooled either publically or at home.
1.1.2.3.10.2. Con: The human race does not require mandated births to grow physically or socially.
1.1.2.3.11. Pro: Child-birth is a dangerous and complicated medical procedure.
1.1.2.3.11.1. Pro: Even under ideal medical supervision each case can be potentially lethal to women. Unexpected bleeding, shock, side effects of medical drugs, infection, complications during c-section carry grave risks to the mother. No one can be forced to undergo a risky medical procedure. Some women know that they will have complications. They can't be forced to risk their lives.
1.1.2.3.11.2. Pro: Even in developed nations, with world class health care systems, there is still a [non-zero](https://www.varsity.co.uk/science/8644) chance that individuals may die whilst giving birth. Women who are under the age of 15, older mothers, and women from lower income groups are particularly at risk.
1.1.2.3.11.2.1. Con: This tiny, statistically insignificant minority of abortions does not justify the vast majority which are elective and entirely unrelated to medical concerns. Fringe cases do not justify the mainstream.
1.1.2.3.11.2.2. Con: The “non-zero” argument suggests that, since we cannot attain a perfect situation \(e.g. perfect birthing surgery\), we may as well accept the potential consequences of bad situations \(e.g. miscarriages\) and not act to reduce those consequences. This implies that we should give up anything where perfection is unlikely to be attained. For example, we may as well give up cars because the chances of having an accident is non-zero.
1.1.2.3.11.2.2.1. Con: Nobody is claiming that childbirth in general isn't worth it due to risk of death. The key point here is allowing the woman to have the choice to bear that risk, or not to.
1.1.2.3.11.2.3. Pro: As long as the risk of death during childbirth remains non-zero, it is unethical to force a person to continue their pregnancy.
1.1.2.3.11.2.4. Pro: In the U.S., [approximately two to three women die in childbirth every day](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/22/572298802/nearly-dying-in-childbirth-why-preventable-complications-are-growing-in-u-s).
1.1.2.3.11.3. Con: Most births aren't that complicated. Child birth has been ongoing since time immemorial.
1.1.2.3.11.3.1. Con: Abortions have also been [ongoing for centuries, if not millennia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_abortion)
1.1.2.3.12. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.6.5.
1.1.2.3.13. Con: The unborn child is a human being, we cannot choose one person's convenience over another person's life. In a civilised society, the inherent right to not be murdered should always rank higher than an individual desire to be free from hardship or inconvenience.
1.1.2.3.14. Pro: A woman shouldn’t have to change her body or the course of her future based on one incidence of intercourse.
1.1.2.3.15. Con: Birth control or abstaining from consensual sexual contact will prevent pregnancy in the overwhelming amount of cases.
1.1.2.3.15.1. Con: Humans are designed to find pleasure in sexual relations. Sex is more than just for reproduction; it is also a bonding mechanism between life-long partners. Therefore an abstinence only method is an unreasonable burden for a person to bear.
1.1.2.3.15.1.1. Con: The primary role of sexual relations is reproduction. This is true in all species that reproduce by mating. The pleasure and bonding effect of a sexual relation is subservient to its purpose as a reproduction mechanism.
1.1.2.3.15.1.1.1. Con: If the primary role of sexual relations was reproduction, people would not have sex unless they wanted to reproduce. We know this is not the case.
1.1.2.3.15.1.1.2. Con: People have sex for [pleasure and bonding effects](https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095\(18\)30132-2/abstract) more often than reproduction across all ages.
1.1.2.3.15.2. Con: Many women are not given proper sex education and are not aware of the risks of unprotected sex.
1.1.2.3.15.2.1. Con: The solution to this is that we should give them the proper education, not the right to abortion.
1.1.2.3.15.2.2. Con: About half the women who get abortions in the [U.S.](https://www.webmd.com/women/tc/abortion-reasons-women-choose-abortion) and [Britain](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/06/half-abortions-due-failed-contraception-new-report/) were actively using some form of contraception \(the pill, condom, etc.\) the month they got pregnant. That might support an argument that they weren't given proper sex ed on the fallibility of contraception methods, but not  an argument that they aren't aware of the importance of protected sex.
1.1.2.3.15.2.3. Pro: In some places, such as the United States, abstinence only education is common in schools and means that when people do decide to have sex, they do not know how to protect themselves.
1.1.2.3.15.2.3.1. Pro: Many people who oppose abortion on religious grounds also oppose contraception. This leads to a no win scenario where women can't enjoy sex without risk of pregnancy.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4. Con: It is possible for women to research contraception and the likelihood of pregnancy before they have sex, such that they are aware of the risks.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.1. Pro: The internet has made such information widely available, even in conservative communities.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.1.1. Con: This would assume that conservative communities are open to the use of contraception and the bodily autonomy of women which is statistically not the case; see Ireland's current referendum movement to remove the eighth amendment to their constitution as well as the concept of contraception in traditional Roman Catholic and similar monotheistic communities. Information may be available, that does not mean it aligns with religious persuasions and permissions.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.2. Con: In many developing countries traditional methods and [superstitions](http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/09/26/why-222-million-women-cant-get-the-birth-control-they-need/) are held in higher regard \(and are more widespread\) than scientific information and [healthcare](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/villages-without-doctors/).
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3. Con: No form of contraception is 100% effective.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.1. Pro: Even used perfectly, condoms are only effective [98%](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-effective-are-condoms) of the time.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood states that the pill is only about [91%](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-effective-are-condoms) effective because it is difficult to maintain perfect use.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.2.1. Con: If the pill is used perfectly it is 99% [effective](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/how-effective-contraception.aspx).
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.3. Con: Using abortion as a form of contraceptive should not be legal because the inconvenience of becoming a parent does not justify the killing of an unborn child. Abortion should only be used in extreme cases where continuing with the pregnancy indangers the life of the mother. Abstinence is always an option for those who cannot accept the risk that comes with all contraceptives.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4. Con: Abstinence is always effective.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.1. Con: An abstinent woman can still be raped and become pregnant.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.1.1. Con: This is not an argument against the efficacy of abstinence. The efficacy rate of hormonal birth control is unaffected by the possibility that a significant other might replace a woman's birth control with a placebo. Similarly, the efficacy rate of condoms generally is not affected by the possibility that either partner might poke holes in the end. An uncontrollable circumstance like rape does not affect the efficacy of intentional abstinence.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.2. Pro: Abstinence is a form of contraception which, by definition cannot fail, as a failure to be abstinent is definitionally no longer abstinence. It is an infallible premise.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.3. Con: Abstinence is only 100% effective if used perfectly. The "typical use" effectiveness of abstinence as a contraceptive is not [100%.](https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2003/12/understanding-abstinence-implications-individuals-programs-and-policies)
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.4. Con: It is unreasonable to expect people to remain abstinent forever. There are people who may want to have sex lives but do not ever want to have children. For them there is no fail proof form of contraception.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.1.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.4.2. Con: This does not absolve them of responsibility for the potential consequences of their actions. If the risk of pregnancy with a given contraceptive method is deemed to be worth the benefit of a sex life, the actors bear full responsibility for that possibility and all of its implications. It is unreasonable to expect people to not desire to be wealthy, and yet society frowns upon robbery at all phases of life. We do not allow immoral or illegal actions to satisfy simple wants.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.4.2.1. Con: Expecting women who do not want to have children to take responsibility by being abstinent may result in other problems that could arise from a life devoid of that type of intimacy and connection.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.4.3. Con: Sterilization procedures \(hysterectomy, vasectomies\) are 100% effective.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.4.3.1. Con: Although it is rare, vasectomy failure is still a [possibility](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/vasectomy/conditioninfo/Pages/effective.aspx). In the first year after vasectomy,15 to 20 of every 10,000 couples experience a pregnancy.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.4.3.2. Con: In [many states](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/sterilization) a woman is required to have a set number of children or be above a certain age to even have their "tubes tied" and most doctors will not even consider hysterectomy as an option unless there is a substantial medical reason.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.4.3.3. Pro: A very small number of those who get vasectomies report any infection, bleeding or pain. The surgery is so simple that it is often done in a doctors office, only requires local anesthetic, and takes around 10 minutes for completion of the procedure.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.4.3.4. Pro: Vasectomies are both reversible and do not stop your body from producing sperm. It is one of the most highly-effective birth control measures while still maintaining the possibility of having children in the future.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.4.3.5. Con: On average, one woman in 200 will become pregnant after undergoing a female sterilisation [procedure](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/female-sterilisation.aspx).
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.4.3.6. Con: There is a risk that female sterilisation will not work - blocked tubes can rejoin any time after the [operation](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/female-sterilisation.aspx).
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.4.3.7. Con: Sterilisation is a near-[permanent](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/female-sterilisation.aspx) procedure - it is not a suitable contraceptive option for people who want to have children in the future.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.4.3.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.4. Con: Low-income women often lack sexual education and even if they do have this information, they sometimes lack the resources to buy contraceptives.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.4.1. Pro: According to [WHO](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/4/10-083329/en/), only 43% of women of reproductive age in less developed countries use modern contraceptive methods, and a wide gap in use is seen between the highest and lowest wealth quintiles \(52% versus 35%, respectively\).
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.5. Con: A lack of sex education in many conservative regions means that couples are often ill equipped to properly use contraceptives such as condoms.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.4.1.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.5.2. Con: This non-excuse is not valid in an era of history where the vast majority of people in developed nations have instant access to the whole of human knowledge at the touch of a finger through the internet.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.5.3. Con: The solution for ignorance is to improve sex education, not implement a policy of allowing abortion.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.5.3.1. Pro: If abortion is legal, sex-ed must become better in order to make a responsible choice.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.5.4. Con: This [data](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/state-indicator/abortion-rate/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22%3A%22Location%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%22asc%22%7D) on abortion rates shows that the highest abortion rates are predominantly in liberal states while the lowest rates are primarily in conservative states.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.5.4.1. Con: According to this table, the highest abortion rates are mostly seen in states with large urban areas, while the lowest are seen in mostly rural states, therefore the difference in abortion rates may be due to other factors such as lack of access. For example, as of 2014 there were [only two abortion providers in the entire state of South Dakota](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/state-facts-about-abortion-south-dakota) \(the 17th largest state in the US at nearly 80,000 sq mi in size\), whereas a quick Google search turned up about 20 in and near New York City.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.5.4.1.1. Con: While lack of access may or may not be a factor in why conservative regions tend to have lower abortion rates, it still wouldn't support the initial unsupported claim that conservative regions have higher abortion rates due to lack of sexual education.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6. Con: Religious women are often taught that use of contraception is deeply immoral.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1. Con: Contraception is considered immoral by certain religions because it interferes with the conception of a child. Religions who are against contraception are therefore also against abortion because it interferes with the birth of a child.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1. Pro: Religious values and beliefs support the view that abortion is immoral.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.1. Con: Until 1827, abortions prior to ["quickening"](https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft967nb5z5&chunk.id=d0e195&brand=ucpress) \(the stage where a mother could feel the fetus moving\) were commonplace and accepted by everyone including religious clerics.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.2. Con: Biblically, life is associated with breath, not conception or heartbeats. From Adam being created from dust and then getting the breath of life; Ezekiel's army of bones; to when Jesus "breathed his last and his soul departed", the Bible is pretty clear on this.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: Judeo-Christian texts actually seem to suggest that "life" begins the moment the "breath of life" enters a person. Even Adam wasn't considered "alive", despite his physical development, until the "breath of life" entered him - which coincided with his first breath: "and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being," \(Genesis 2:7\).
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.2.2. Con: It is not necessary to equate the Biblical use of "Breath of Life" to the first breath of oxygen through the nostrils. Adam was formed outside the womb, thus he had no oxygen coursing through his veins from his mothers cardio-vascular system, as a baby in the womb does. In essence, the breath of life is present for the fetus at the stage of an independent heartbeat at the very latest, which feeds the oxygen from the mother through the unborn child.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.2.2.1. Con: A current and accurate scientific view of oxygen transfer to a fetus does not alter the historical view that life began with the first \(observable\) "breath". While it may or may not be accurate, it is the belief that was held at the time.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.2.2.2. Con: Adam is a myth and has no scientific foundation. The early Hebrews believed men planted seeds in women who were vessels to carry the man's baby. They can not be reliable sources for this discussion.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.3. Con: Our laws are based on secular values, not specific religious ones, as the latter can vary from one religion to another.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.3.1. Pro: The moral stance on abortion differs between religions, and therefore is not universally considered murder.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Abortion is [not uncommon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_abortion) among Hindu and Sikh communities where there is a cultural preference for male babies over female.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: In [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_abortion#Islam) a fetus is thought to become a living soul only after 120 days of gestation and so abortion is generally seen as permissible until this time.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.4. Con: Non-theocratic governments can't make religious/philosophical decisions for it's citizens. The concept of Life is philosophical not scientific, so the point at which life begins is a religious opinion or philosophical construct. Therefore this decision can't be made by the government, and should be left up to women and their doctors.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.4.1. Con: Human life is not a subjective concept, it is a well documented [scientific concept](https://lozierinstitute.org/a-scientific-view-of-when-life-begins/).
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.4.1.1. Con: The question is not whether there is life in an embryo--there is, and it has human DNA. So does the egg before it is fertilized. The question is whether 8 cells is a human person.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The above claim is not questioning the personhood of the embryo but whether life is a philosophical or scientific concept.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.4.1.2. Con: The article quoted states, "this definition does not directly address the central ethical question surrounding the embryo: What value ought society place on human life at the earliest stages of development?"
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.7.1.1.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.5. Pro: Classical [Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_abortion#Hinduism) texts strongly condemn abortion.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.6. Pro: Many [Orthodox Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_abortion#Judaism) feel that abortion is wrong, except in cases where it is necessary to save the woman's life.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.6.1. Con: Historically, abortion has been [accepted in Judaism.](https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/abortion) While many orthodox Jews oppose abortion, many do not oppose it.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.7. Pro: Abortion is generally forbidden in [Sikhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_abortion#Sikhism) on the basis that it interferes with the work of God.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.8. Pro: The [Catholic Church](https://www.catholic.com/tract/abortion) has always strongly condemned abortion.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.8.1. Con: Catholics do not uniformly oppose abortion. For example, the [Catholics for choice group](http://www.catholicsforchoice.org/about-us/), believe that abortion rights and Catholicism are not incompatible.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.8.2. Con: The Catholic Church has always condemned birth control as well. Most people, including Catholics, do not agree with this stance. Therefore, the Catholic Church's moral stance on an issue is generally accepted to fallible.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.8.3. Pro: [Pope Francis](https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2016/11/20/pope-francis-calls-abortion-horrendous-crime-grave-sin/) described abortion as a 'very grave sin' and a 'horrendous crime'.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.8.3.1. Con: Pope Francis's statements made it clear that women who have had abortions, would still be considered members of the Catholic Church, and that, they could be forgiven by priests. This represents a [softening](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38054640) of the Catholic Church's position towards abortion. Previously, any individual who performed or had an abortion could be immediately excommunicated from the Catholic Church.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.9. Con: No one can be forced to live according to others' religious beliefs. Any denial of access to abortion based on religion is nothing other than forcing someone's beliefs on to others.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.9.1. Pro: If abortions are denied to women on the basis of another’s religious beliefs on when life begins, then the woman loses her right to her own religious beliefs.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.9.2. Pro: In the United States, the First Amendment states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Banning abortion on religious grounds is therefore unconstitutional and illegal in the United States.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.10. Con: Religion is a human construct, it's morality comes only from other humans who interpret it, not a divine command. The form belief takes in practice is an entirely human process. Therefore the mere context of religion does not add any weight to a claim.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.11. Con: In a theocracy this argument might fit in somewhere, but in a free democracy it has no place. Choice is a human process not a divine arbitration. If a god dictated our entire life then there would be no choices ever and our existence would be inconsequential to the universe.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.12. Con: Many religions allow for a practical application of abortion. Judaism allows for abortion in cases that put the mother at risk or when the means to support the child are unavailable to the parent. Islam, under all circumstances, says that a foetus is not imbued with a soul until the 12th week. Both permit abortion in the case of rape. If this is to be an argument then one religion must be shown to be correct and above all others.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.13. Pro: The [Bible](https://www.ucg.org/the-good-news/the-abortion-debate-what-does-god-say) shows that God felt all human lives should be protected, including those in the womb.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.13.1. Con: Christians have long discarded many outmoded Bible covenants. The Bible states, "But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head..."\([1 Corinthians 11:5](http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-5.htm)\).Enforcing this in many countries would would be resisted by many of the same who are pro-life.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.13.2. Con: This statement is false and likely comes from a misreading of Exodus 21:22-24,  which proscribes a fine payable to the husband for accidentally harming a fetus, but “eye for eye/ life for life” if the woman carrying a child is harmed/killed.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.13.3. Con: There are numerous examples of god-ordained infanticide, child murder, and the murder of pregnant women in the Old Testament. These include [Jeremiah 11:22-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+11%3A22-23&version=NIV), [Psalm 135:8](http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-8.htm) and [2 Kings 15:16](http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-16.htm).
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.13.4. Con: There is no scientific or factual evidence whatsoever of the existence of a "God", and any beliefs that are credited to him are simply moral constructs devised by humans.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.13.5. Con: The Bible does not describe the death of the child inside a baby as murder or death, but as property lost.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.13.6. Pro: The Bible states that God believes if a man causes injury to a woman who is pregnant, and in turn kills the fetus, then he should give [life for life](https://www.ucg.org/the-good-news/the-abortion-debate-what-does-god-say). This indicates that God believes the fetus to be a living being and its killing to be wrong.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.13.6.1. Con: This is inaccurate. Exodus 21:22 says that if a woman is accidentally injured in a fight and miscarries, the one who injured her [has to pay a fee to the husband](https://biblehub.com/drb/exodus/21.htm). The husband decides on the fee. If the woman dies, the normal punishment for murder is applied \(eye for an eye etc\). Some translations use the term "mischief" to describe the woman dying. Other translations specify different punishments based on [how far along in development the fetus was.](https://biblehub.com/sep/exodus/21.htm)
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.13.7. Con: Religious views are non-factual and interpretive. While there should never be mandated abortions due to religious beliefs, there should never be a legal banning of abortions due to one group's interpretation of their religious doctrine.
1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.14. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.13.7.
1.1.2.3.15.2.5. Con: If an un-educated woman becomes pregnant out of ignorance, then why is it okay to kill her baby before birth while is not okay after birth? This argument is basically about if the unborn is a human being similar to the born baby or not.
1.1.2.3.15.2.6. Con: Every individual who knows the basic natural or scientific facts about having sex has responsibility for the the consequences already known by this hypothesis.
1.1.2.3.15.2.6.1. Con: Knowing that sex causes pregnancy is not nearly sufficient. It is knowing clearly how to prevent pregnancy and / or to use contraception effectively that will prevent significant numbers of unwanted pregnancies.
1.1.2.3.15.3. Con: Regardless of whether there are methods to avoid pregnancy, once a woman is pregnant she should be given an option to avoid the gruelling effects of pregnancy.
1.1.2.3.15.4. Con: "Birth control" and "abstinence" are preventative measures. Given the original thesis of whether women should have the right to abort, and the sub-thesis on hardships of pregnancies, this argument is irrelevant / misplaced. No one is thinking of "birth control" or "abstinence" after they've become pregnant. This argument would be better placed in a discussion of birth control or how to prevent underage/unwanted pregnancies.
1.1.2.3.15.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.
1.1.2.4. Con: No matter the risks associated, pregnancy is natural; it is meant to happen, whereas taking hormone pills or having a surgical procedure are irrefutably unnatural and carry greater risks.
1.1.3. Pro: Even if adoption isn't perfect, it is still better than abortion because the child survives.
1.1.3.1. Con: Because the system is so overburdened, children are often placed in [abusive foster homes](http://www.upworthy.com/the-horror-stories-these-former-foster-care-kids-have-sound-too-bad-to-be-true-but-theyre-not) or replaced in the care of their abusive parents.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The rate of sexual abuse in foster homes in the UK was found to be [four times higher](http://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=6703) than the national average, and twenty eight times higher in group homes.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Despite the fact that $22 billion are spent on [foster care programs](http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/FosterCare/story?id=2017991&page=1) every year in the US, nearly 60,000 children are reported weekly as abused or neglected. This suggests that the state is incapable of effectively preventing child abuse within the foster care system.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: [Research](http://www.liftingtheveil.org/foster04.htm) in the US determined that over 28% of foster children experienced abuse while in the foster care system, and many [former foster children](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/somatic-psychology/201201/the-foster-care-system-and-its-victims-part-2) believe that the number of incidents are much higher.
1.1.3.1.3.1. Con: Quality of life should not determine value of life. Many great minds who have made lasting contributions to society experienced abusive childhoods.
1.1.3.1.4. Con: The possibility of a bad childhood doesn't justify taking an innocent human's life.
1.1.3.1.5. Pro: The banning of abortion in Romania lead to an orphan crisis, where [150,000](http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/14/news/mn-29897) unwanted infants were put in extremely poorly run state orphanages.
1.1.3.1.5.1. Pro: Even decades on, many of these orphans [suffer](https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-01-16/romanian-orphans-face-challenges-decades-after-adoption) from mental and physical health conditions as a result of the conditions they lived in.
1.1.3.2. Con: Youth in foster care and adults who formerly were placed in care have disproportionately high [rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3061347/) of emotional and behavioural disorders.
1.1.3.3. Pro: The child can go on to have a whole life through adoption, and beyond the nine months of pregnancy, does not have to be a burden for the parent who did not want or was not ready to have them.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: This ignores the health of, and the concerns of the mother.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Some women are not capable of carrying a child without grave risk to them.
1.1.3.4. Pro: There are many people who are unable to have children and would like the opportunity to adopt one. In the [US](http://thefederalist.com/2016/08/18/why-so-many-families-who-want-to-adopt-cant/) there are significantly more people who want to adopt than there are children to adopt.
1.1.4. Pro: Some women do not feel ready to raise a child, but for religious reasons, think that having an abortion is immoral. For them, adoption is a viable option.
1.1.4.1. Con: Legalizing abortion does not prevent women from giving up their children for adoption. Religious women can still choose to give their children up for adoption.
1.1.5. Pro: Adoption respects the child's right to life while allowing the birth mother to forgo many of the burdens of raising a child, and instead allows that child to be raised by parents who are better equipped to take on that burden.
1.1.5.1. Con: Many, not all. Pregnancy can cause a plethora of issues for a mother, especially a [young](http://americanpregnancy.org/unplanned-pregnancy/teen-pregnancy-issues-challenges/) mother. The hips widen, extra fat is added, hormones go into overdrive, and there are many pregnancy-specific conditions that are often life-threatening or fatal.
1.1.5.2. Con: The adoption system is also not very good in most countries. A large part of the decision for women between abortion and adoption is whether or not the baby can be raised in a stable and healthy environment.
1.1.6. Con: Adoption does not guarantee a safe life for children.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Private foster care agencies have [allowed](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/evey-rosenbloom/where-do-the-children-go_1_b_8728758.html) criminals and registered sex offenders to acquire licenses and adopt foster children. This has led to neglect, sexual abuse and murders of children.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: A caseworker in one such agency reported that three girls were happy and healthy in their foster home when in fact they had been [dead for three months](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-09-20/news/9609200157_1_state-caseworker-report-illinois-supreme-court). This is indicative of the sheer ineptitude of many foster care agencies.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Many LGBTQ children in foster homes suffer abuse. As a result, in the US, 56% spent some time homeless because they believed they were safer on the streets than they were in their foster homes \([p. 5](https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/LGBTQyouth.pdf)\).
1.1.6.2. Pro: State institutions are bad at properly assessing whether or not the environment of foster homes are safe.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: According to the [Child advocate review](http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/OPI/Reports_to_the_Legislature/child_advocate_review_december2008.pdf) \(p.15\), the quality of safety assessments only met standards in 46% of reviewed cases.
1.1.6.2.2. Pro: The screening process is only as good as the person who makes the assessment and the level of stress or workload they may be facing. In New York, the [40% turnover](http://www.gothamgazette.com/housing/1915-flaws-in-the-screening-process-for-foster-parents) in caseworkers is testament to the heavy workload they face, which could reflect in the quality of their work.
1.1.6.2.2.1. Pro: The average foster care social worker is paid [$47,372](https://infograph.venngage.com/p/243734/3-ways-to-improve-the-foster-care-system) annually. This is substantially less than other working professionals such as IT Managers \([$79,584](http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2015/07/09/average-salaries-for-americans-median-salaries-for-common-jobs.html)\) or HR managers \([$73,474](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/human-resources-manager-salary-SRCH_KO0,23.htm)\). These workers are then forced to make tough decisions and deal with difficult situations on a day to day basis.
1.1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.1.6.4. Pro: There are more orphans and children in foster care in the world than families who are [willing and able to adopt](https://adoption-beyond.org/adoption-statistics/).
1.1.6.4.1. Con: This is a good reason to publicise adoption as an alternative to potential parents.
1.1.6.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.
1.1.6.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.4.
1.1.6.5. Con: Most children would probably prefer adoption to abortion if given a choice, even if adoption and foster care are not perfect.
1.1.6.5.1. Con: It is not possible to infer the preferences of an entity that lacks that the mental architecture to carry a preference.
1.1.6.5.1.1. Con: It is reasonable to assume that a late-stage fetus \(e.g. 8 months\) is no less capable of having a preference than a newborn.
1.1.6.5.1.1.1. Con: Abortions do not occur at 8 months, except in cases of fatal foetal abnormality or the death of the foetus.
1.1.7. Con: To deny abortion forces a child to be born and live in a world where they are unwanted by their natural mother.
1.1.7.1. Con: That does not imply it will not be wanted by anyone. Adoptive parents are often more caring and loving than natural ones because they're actually looking forward to having children but they can't themselves.
1.1.8. Pro: It is very likely that many adoptees and former foster children appreciate the [fact that they are alive](http://www.teenbreaks.com/abortion/abortionsurvivors.cfm).
1.1.8.1. Con: The [suicide](https://adoption.com/adoption-related-suicide-statistics-prevention) rate of adoptees is four times greater than the suicide rate of non-adoptees.
1.1.8.1.1. Con: Even with those tragic statistics in mind, the fact remains that many of adoptees appreciate the fact that they are alive. 7.6% perecent of adoptees trying to commit a suicide, as stated in this [study](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/810625), are still a small minority.
1.1.8.2. Con: Appreciating that you're alive is only possible if you're alive. There's no opposite — you can't be regretful that you're not alive.
1.1.8.2.1. Con: There is no evidence to support this claim.
1.1.9. Con: Choosing adoption over abortion is a very different decision, given it requires a woman to go through pregnancy and childbirth, and bring a genetically related child into the world. Therefore it is not actually a reasonable alternative.
1.1.9.1. Pro: Childbirth is a risk for any woman. Women that have health issues and should not give birth as it will impede their health need a viable and legal alternative.
1.1.9.2. Con: If it is more reasonable to place a newborn for adoption rather than kill the newborn, then it's more reasonable to pursue adoption rather than abortion. If someone disagrees with this analogy, then the real disagreement has to do with equal treatment of all humans regarding basic rights, not with adoption vs abortion.
1.1.9.2.1. Con: This analogy doesn't work as choosing for adoption during or at the start of the pregnancy entails being pregnant for longer and giving birth while in the first choice those costs have already been paid.
1.1.9.3. Pro: There are are a lot of social implications for the mother, she would be visibly pregnant to her family and peers and be judged and constantly have to explain herself, as well as having to go through the unpleasant experience of pregnancy with no good outcome for her.
1.1.9.4. Pro: Though adoption is a viable alternative for some, we must then understand that for many women abandoning a child through adoption is just as bad. Either way she is losing a child. With adoption she is then bound to have emotional scars regarding the child’s well being and fears that the unwanted child will resurface later in her life.
1.1.9.5. Pro: There are a large number of financial requirements of being pregnant and having a child, even if you plan to give it up for adoption. These include pre-natal care and hospital care during labour. These costs may mean adoption is not a viable alternative for many women.
1.1.9.5.1. Con: In many cases women may be able to find people wanting to adopt the child even before it is born, and in doing so those potential adoptive parents may be willing to take on some or all of the financial costs of the pregnancy.
1.1.9.6. Pro: The mother could suffer many physical, emotional, psychological, and socioeconomic problems if she had to carry the unwanted baby to term and give birth. Many women - [around 10-15%](https://womensmentalhealth.org/specialty-clinics/postpartum-psychiatric-disorders/) - suffer perinatal mental illness, which can lead to further socioeconomic and physical problems.
1.1.9.7. Pro: Even apart from the trauma of childbirth that a woman must undergo if she chooses adoption, pregnancy and childbirth cause incredible disruption to a woman's life, dreams, and future. A woman may be compelled to drop out of school, may be subjected to stigma when applying for jobs or higher education, or may become sick enough that she is unable to work or study.
1.1.10. Pro: All reasons to have an abortion that relate to post-birth issues such as "finances" or  "emotionally ready" are rendered moot by the availability of adoption. Any hypothetically legitimate reason to justify an abortion would have to relate to a good reason to prevent the birth.
1.1.10.1. Pro: Access to proper sex education and family planning tools in all areas should be the first step in promoting adoption as an alternative.
1.1.10.2. Con: If finances are a concern, then 9 months of going to regular ob/gyn appointments with ultrasounds \(often not covered by insurance\), taking vitamins, and missing work due to feeling ill or bed rest is not affordable, especially if it results in loss of job.
1.1.10.3. Con: For many women, giving birth to a child after carrying it for 9 months, knowing she may never see the child again, is more emotional scarring than aborting a fetus very early on.
1.1.10.4. Con: Adoption may not always be a possibility. Many children given up for adoption are never adopted.
1.1.10.4.1. Pro: There are [hundreds of thousands](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/afcarsreport22.pdf) of children waiting to be adopted. The reality is that tens of thousands of children will never be adopted, and are condemned to a childhood of foster care and youth homes. To say that 'adoption is always an alternative' is simply untrue.
1.1.10.4.2. Pro: About [135,000](http://www.pbs.org/pov/offandrunning/fact-sheet/) children are adopted in the United States each year vs about [650,000](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm) abortions in 2014. The number of adoptions would need to increase substantially to make up the difference or hundreds of thousands of additional children every year would end up in the already overburdened foster care system.
1.1.10.4.2.1. Con: The number of abortions would decrease if abortion was illegal. Not all unwanted pregnancies remain unwanted and parents may change their mind. Therefore the number of children in foster care would not increase as proposed.
1.1.10.4.2.1.1. Con: Countries in which abortion is available have [similar abortion rates](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/women-in-countries-where-abortion-is-illegal-just-as-likely-to-have-one-as-countries-where-it-is-a7025671.html) to countries in which abortion is illegal.
1.1.10.4.2.2. Con: This problem could simply be solved through better funding and more attention to the system. This is likely given the news coverage and discourse banning abortion would inevitably lead to.
1.1.10.4.2.2.1. Con: The real problem here is that adoption is so incredibly expensive, not that it doesn't have enough funding. It is hard to believe that it actually costs [$34,000](http://www.americanadoptions.com/adopt/the_costs_of_adopting) to facilitate a single adoption.
1.1.10.4.2.2.2. Con: The overlap between politicians who espouse pro-life beliefs and politicians who vote against funding increases for social welfare programs such as Child Protective Services is so significant that if it were a Venn diagram, it would very nearly be a circle. Yet private charity is unlikely to be able to handle the addition of ~500,000 extra children per year to the system.
1.1.10.4.2.3. Pro: The high demand for foster homes would likely force the government to accept applications from individuals who are not well suited for the role.
1.1.10.4.2.4. Pro: Women are likely to seek even more illegal abortions when the foster care system is imploding and can't guarantee a decent life for their children.
1.1.10.4.3. Con: This statement implies that growing up in foster home is worse than being aborted which doesn't seem tenable, especially when the recipient of either option has no say in the matter.
1.1.10.4.3.1. Con: Being aborted can't be bad to the subject because they stop experiencing good and bad.
1.1.10.4.4. Pro: Adoption is not a viable option in a huge number of countries, where social care system is not developed enough, so children remain in the orphanage until they are 18 and then there is no guarantee they will live normal lives as part of society, as they may have become institutionalised.
1.1.10.4.4.1. Pro: As of 2005, countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar, Benin, Mozambique, Niger, Tanzania had adoption rates between[6-10 per million children under 18 years old and approximately 2 per million children under 5](http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/adoption2010/child_adoption.pdf).
1.1.10.4.5. Con: Babies are adopted more easily than older children. The average age of[children waiting to be adopted](https://showhope.org/2015/06/19/9-stats-about-the-orphan-crisis/) is 7.5 years.
1.1.10.4.6. Con: Adoptive parents can be chosen before the baby is born. There are people on [waiting lists](https://www.adoption.net/waiting-list-page/) to be chosen already.
1.1.11. Con: Adoption is not always a legitimate alternative.
1.1.11.1. Pro: If a woman is in an abusive relationship, adoption is not always a viable option to abortion as the abusive father still has paternity rights and could claim the child and use it as leverage against the mother, as well as abuse the child itself at some point.
1.1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.4.
1.1.11.3. Pro: Adoption is not a viable alternative to abortion in cases when the pregnancy endangers the mother.
1.1.11.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.5.1.4.
1.1.11.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.3.1.
1.1.11.4. Pro: Adoption is not a viable option when the mother is a drug addict. Drug addicts, prostitutes, young girls, marginalized women, etc. may not have the resources necessary for proper prenatal care. They may not have the support necessary to contact adoptive parents.
1.1.11.5. Pro: Forcing women to give birth will lead to an increase of the number of children waiting to be adopted. This will ultimately increase tax payer burden as it is the state who funds the resources required to care for these children. Taxes will go up and affect everyone, because it is considerably more expensive to fund many individual lives over many years then it would be to fund the organizations that perform abortions \(which is something that is already done\).
1.1.11.6. Pro: Adoption is not an alternative when abortion is chosen to avoid health risks, known pathologies would lead to a painful life for a future life, or the pregnancy itself would otherwise negatively impact the life of the mother.
1.1.11.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.5.
1.1.12. Con: The life long impacts of adoption, including [trauma](https://postinstitute.com/the-adopted-child-trauma-and-its-impact/) is well [evidenced](https://www.psychology.org.au/inpsych/2014/august/green/) and documented.
1.1.13. Con: With option of choice, women and girls will be less likely to go to the underground market \(illegal providers of abortions\), but rather be empowered legally to speak to those who could most offer them support and counselling, regardless of their choice. This would make it easier to keep a baby or allow it to be adopted because social supports would be more readily mobilized.
1.1.14. Pro: Technology will make early adoptions even easier, by allowing things such as embryo transfers for others to become surrogate parents.
1.1.14.1. Pro: [Embryo transfers](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/04/us/infertile-woman-has-baby-through-embryo-transfer.html?sec=health) can be performed. This is where a child in his or her earliest stages of development can be transferred from one womb to another, a surrogate's. This circumvents murdering the child or having to bring the child to term. Advances in technology have only served to strengthen the pro-life's argument. In fact, this solution has been available since the 1980s.
1.1.14.2. Con: Although embryo transfer is now more prevalent, the costs which are \(in the UK\) [in the thousands,](https://www.bournhall.co.uk/fees-funding/fee-calculator/) are not feasible or easily accessible to most women, some even [going into bankruptcy,](https://www.shape.com/lifestyle/mind-and-body/infertility-ivf-surrogacy-costs) potentially putting them under further financial and emotional stress.
1.1.15. Con: Many women who consider abortion the better choice when they discover they're pregnant won't be able to give the child up for adoption after spending nine months gestating it and then giving birth. This could leave them with the same problems they wanted to avoid through an abortion.
1.1.16. Pro: Adoption agencies can ensure that the child is matched with a family that has similar values and beliefs to that of the biological mother.
1.1.16.1. Con: This really isn't an important aspect. The mother's values and beliefs might be the reason why she is unable to care for the child.
1.1.16.2. Con: There is no way to ensure that information can be verified, potential parents can just lie about their values to get a child faster.
1.1.16.2.1. Con: The process for adopting a child can be [very long](https://adoptionnetwork.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-adopt-a-child), and it involves a [psychological assessment](http://www.annegraham.ca/international-adoption-psychological-assessment.html) that can hardly be forged.
1.1.16.3. Pro: There is a [shortage](http://www.americanadoptions.com/pregnant/waiting_adoptive_families) of children in need of parents in the west, meaning that agencies can choose parents from a large competitive pool.
1.1.16.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.
1.1.17. Con: The question here is whether women should or should not have the right to choose abortion, so the fact that adoption is a viable option is not incompatible with having abortion as another option.
1.1.17.1. Con: If it is true that adoption is a viable option, then abortion is not the only option. If there is another option besides abortion, with the benefit of saving lives, it should be valued over abortion. Thus adoption is a better option than abortion. We should do our best to encourage the better option over the weaker and ethically problematic one.
1.1.17.1.1. Con: Believing one option to be "better" is not an argument against people having multiple options.
1.1.17.2. Pro: Adoption is another choice that a woman should be able to make, but not forced into.
1.2. Pro: There are many reasons a woman may not be equipped to or want to raise a child. In these cases, it is important that she is able to choose abortion.
1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.2.2. Pro: A woman may not feel emotionally, mentally or otherwise prepared to have a child, and ultimately this could be damaging for the child and for the relationship between the mother and child.
1.2.2.1. Con: Not being prepared to carry the consequences of your decisions and actions is not justification for terminating a human life. Both parents should accept the responsibility they brought upon themselves and prioritize the life they brought into the world. Mental and emotional readiness is something a person wills themselves into, not something that comes out of the blue one day.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Some pregnancies are the result of an act of violence like rape.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: The crimes of a father have not, do not, and shall not, in the context of a Western, post-Enlightenment justice system, transfer guilt to a child of that father. An attempt to justify homicide by citing the guilt of a relative in an unrelated crime is a non-sequitur.
1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Neither shall that guilt be transferred to the woman who was raped and who is a fully fledged human with all the rights they're entailed.
1.2.2.1.1.1.2. Con: The use of the term homicide when used on a human fetus \(particulary before a certain period of development\) is dubious and opinionated at best. Women, who are in this case victims of a crime themselves, have right for a different opinion on the matter and should not be forced to drastically change their lives because of someone else's world view.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.3.1.1.
1.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: In cases of non consensual sex, the person who was forced by someone to have sexual intercourse has no moral obligation to not kill the unborn-person. Every harm caused to the unborn is responsibility of the person who forced the other to have sexual intercourse.
1.2.2.1.1.3.1. Con: You cannot transfer responsibility for harm to another person. The person responsible for the abortion is the person going to the clinic.
1.2.2.1.1.4. Con: In the rare case of pregnancy due to rape, terminating the life of the unborn child will not correct the horror done to the woman, it will simply pass on the act of force to an innocent party.
1.2.2.1.1.4.1. Con: Termination of the unborn child's life is not done to mitigate the effects of the crime on one's past, it is to minimize its effects on one's future.
1.2.2.1.1.4.2. Con: Terminating a pregnancy in the case of rape is not typically done with the intention of changing the fact she was raped in the past.
1.2.2.1.1.5. Con: Just because a person is conceived in unfortunate and difficult circumstances does not mean their life has zero/very low value and their existence can be terminated without any moral qualm.
1.2.2.1.1.6. Pro: When women experience a trauma such as rape it is understandable that they would want to forget or move on from such an experience. Carrying and then having a child fathered by their rapist does not allow them to do this.
1.2.2.1.1.6.1. Con: Possible or even probable psychological stress is not, has never been, and never should be, morally, ethically, or legally, justification for homicide. Lethal force used in the face of an imminent threat of physical harm is the only excuse to homicide.
1.2.2.1.1.6.2. Con: About 70% of women who get pregnant due to rape choose to keep their children. In two studies done on the topic, none of these women later regretted the choice. Of the 30% who chose to abort the child, about 78% later regretted it. \(Mahkorn and Dolan, p. 194\).
1.2.2.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: "I, having lived through rape, and also having raised a child ‘conceived in rape’, feel personally assaulted and insulted every time I hear that abortion should be legal because of rape and incest. I feel that we’re being used to further the abortion issue, even though we’ve not been asked to tell our side of the story."  [Kathleen DeZeeuw](http://afterabortion.org/2005/victims-and-victors-speaking-out-about-their-pregnancies-abortions-and-children-resulting-from-sexual-assault/)
1.2.2.1.1.7. Pro: Raped women often don't have an option to use birth control.
1.2.2.1.1.8. Con: The number of abortions as a result of rape are [around or less than 1%](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/13/us/rape-and-incest-just-1-of-all-abortions.html) of abortions.
1.2.2.1.1.8.1. Con: That data does not take into consideration that the majority of rapes and consent violations are unreported.
1.2.2.1.1.8.1.1. Con: This doesn't really matter if said incident didn't end in a pregnancy, therefore, no abortion was needed. If an unreported rape did end in pregnancy, the woman could have had an abortion without the need to report the rape.
1.2.2.1.1.8.1.2. Con: It's estimated that about [2/3s of all rapes go unreported.](https://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/rape-sexual-violence/Pages/rape-notification.aspx) Based on this, one could speculate that as much as 3% of abortions are necessitated by rape. This estimation is still a small fraction of abortion cases.
1.2.2.1.1.8.2. Con: The data in these studies is also very antiquated in that the newest data cited is from 1987.
1.2.2.1.1.8.3. Pro: This extreme outlier cannot be used as a valid argument for the legalization of the other 99% of abortion cases.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: Many women do not become pregnant by choice. It is wrong to force these women to remain pregnant when they do not want to be.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: Contraception can fail during sex and lead to pregnancy.
1.2.2.1.2.1.1. Con: If a person does not want to conceive a child \(be it man or woman\) they simply should not have sex. Creating new life is an inevitable consequence of having sex. While risk can be mitigated it can not be avoided entirely.
1.2.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Skin cancer is a natural consequence of sun exposure. Would you advise people who don't want skin cancer to simply not go outside? Going outside and sex are both natural components of healthy lives. Both entail unwanted risks that can be only partially mitigated. That does not mean however that they should be avoided.
1.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Having children is also a natural component of a healthy life. It is not one that we all chose but it's the reason sex exists. Childbirth has historically been associated with the natural act of sex.
1.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Whether or not someone goes out in the sun it that person's choice. On the one hand they may get skin cancer, on the other they may deal with vitamin D deficiency. Likewise having sex is a person's choice. They may get a child or they may die lonely. What isn't a choice a person gets to make is killing someone else, regardless of weather they got skin cancer or pregnant.
1.2.2.1.2.1.2. Con: The frequent failure of contraception does not mean the woman is forced to become pregnant anymore than the far more rare failure of a parachute to open means a skydiver was forced to jump out of a plane. Failure of a precaution taken doesn't indicate one was forced into an action or consequence.
1.2.2.1.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.5.
1.2.2.1.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.
1.2.2.1.2.1.5. Con: Contraceptives advertise that they are not 100% effective. Even though these devices or drugs decrease the likelihood of pregnancy they don't negate the responsibility for the risk of the action chosen.
1.2.2.1.2.2. Con: If this were the case, an analogy could be drawn to men impregnating women. A boy could make several girls pregnant, say he did not choose to, and claim he has no obligation to support them.
1.2.2.1.2.2.1. Con: This is a valid but separate argument about legally severing paternity obligations.  Whether a boy is legally obligated to provide support to a child is not equivalent to a woman being required to give up her bodily autonomy for someone else.
1.2.2.1.2.2.2. Con: Having to carry a child for 9 months is not in any way comparable to paying child support as one has physical and emotional consequences while the other is a mere financial consequence.
1.2.2.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Whether pregnancy is experienced as a burden or a joy, or whether financial support is a hardship or peanuts, is a matter of personal circumstance. These apples and pears should not be compared or weighed against each other.
1.2.2.1.2.3. Con: But you have to keep in mind that the preborn child didn't have a choice either. The child did not choose to be inside that woman's body. It's not their fault that they happen to be there. They did nothing wrong. They should not be killed.
1.2.2.1.2.3.1. Con: There is no such thing as a pre-born 'child'. There are things such as a fertilized egg or embryo which grows into a foetus after the first trimester. The discussion about embryonic or foetal rights is an ethical one and highly controversial. In several \(religiously inspired\) constitutions \([lawteacher.net](https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/medical-law/embryo-and-foetal-rights.php)\), 'personal' rights are granted to embryos or foetuses but there is no consensus in philosophy, law or politics that this is the most accurate way of terminology.
1.2.2.1.2.3.2. Con: A tumor does not have a choice. The tumor did not choose to be in a body. It's not it's fault it happened to be there. It is alive and owes its existence to its host. It should not be killed even if it is unwanted.
1.2.2.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.2.2.1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.
1.2.2.1.2.6. Con: Medicine took care of this, by giving women the opportunity to prevent pregnancy. With the safety net of condoms, contraceptives and the morning-after pills the chance of getting pregnant is almost zero. The probability is [0.006%.](http://www.mathscareers.org.uk/article/statistically-safe-sex/)
1.2.2.1.2.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.
1.2.2.1.2.6.2. Con: Given that many women still find themselves in circumstances where they are pregnant and do not want to be, the bodily autonomy argument stands in those cases.
1.2.2.1.2.6.3. Con: We need not consider the circumstances of any pregnancy. If we accept the legal and moral concept of bodily autonomy it would be true in any circumstance that a person has no obligation to support the life of another with their body. Thus it would be true of any pregnancy that it's bearer would have the right to terminate it. We could claim it's worse if someone could have prevented an abortion with contraception, but that has no bearing on whether or not it should be allowed.
1.2.2.1.2.6.3.1. Con: Abortion is a unilateral decision involving two parties, therefore bodily autonomy doesn't apply.
1.2.2.1.2.6.3.1.1. Con: Bodily autonomy means no one has to use their body to support another even if that person will die if the support is lost.
1.2.2.1.2.6.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.5.
1.2.2.1.2.6.5. Con: Specific mental health situations side, access to medicine doesn't nullify one's body autonomy.
1.2.2.1.2.6.5.1. Con: Actually it does. Medicine allows for the autonomy of one individual \(the mother\), without violating the autonomy of another \(the child\). You have a right to be naked but you can’t exercise that right in front of a nursery school. If there are reasonable avenues that maintain the autonomy of both individuals \(prevention of conception\) then outlawing a single mode \(termination\) that violates one individual’s but upholds another’s should be pursued.
1.2.2.1.2.7. Con: \<0.05% of abortions result from rape. ~7% result from fetal or maternal health problems. [~92.5%](http://abort73.com/abortion_facts/us_abortion_statistics/) result from the woman's lifestyle choices or socio-economic status. Immaturity, irresponsibility or financial status are not a legal, moral, or ethical defences for murder. By law people are not permitted to murder their spouses or children because they are inconvenient to their lifestyle or expensive to maintain.
1.2.2.1.2.8. Pro: The urge to have sex is a primal and critical part of nature. One does not "choose" to have sex. Reproduction is a force of nature.
1.2.2.1.2.8.1. Con: Abortion is not a part of nature, abandonment is. The runt always gets left behind. Can't bring nature into an argument that takes a rational decision.
1.2.2.1.2.9. Con: Women consent to the risk of becoming pregnant whenever they choose to have sex.
1.2.2.1.2.9.1. Con: We do not hold people responsible for all unintended consequences of their actions. If a woman did not intend to become pregnant as a result of sex, she should not be forced to remain pregnant.
1.2.2.1.2.9.1.1. Con: When one human makes another human biologically dependent, they have an obligation to provide for that need they created.
1.2.2.1.2.9.1.2. Con: We do not hold people responsible when the consequences of an action could not have been foreseen, but pregnancy is a very foreseeable consequence of sex.
1.2.2.1.2.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.
1.2.2.1.2.9.3. Con: When women use contraception it is clear they are trying to avoid pregnancy and therefore should not be held responsible for the outcome.
1.2.2.1.2.9.3.1. Pro: Use of contraception indicates consent to pregnancy has explicitly not been given.
1.2.2.1.2.9.3.1.1. Con: Virtually all common contraceptives have clear and explicit labeling indicating their use is not 100% effective. If “buyer beware” is a reasonable principle, and the labels are clear, all literate women using these products have given consent.
1.2.2.1.2.9.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.1.
1.2.2.1.2.9.3.3. Con: Considering the 'consequence' is a large one, involving the creation of a new genetically distinct human life, mere implied intent to avoid new life forming is not enough ethically to support destroying human life once formed.
1.2.2.1.2.9.3.4. Con: If I drive drunk, but only at 30 on a 65, and I hit someone and kill them, I am not free from responsibility because my slow driving shows an unwillingness to kill. There is a surefire way to not hit someone: not drive. There is a surefire way not to get pregnant: not have sex. Birth control is not the best measure a woman could take, therefore she is not fully committed to not having a baby.
1.2.2.1.2.9.3.5. Con: There is a always a risk of failure with contraception which women need to take account of when they have sex. It is insufficient to say that one intended to avoid pregnancy.
1.2.2.1.2.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.1.1.
1.2.2.1.2.9.5. Pro: When someone hits the accelerator and rear-ends the car in front of them, they cannot avoid responsibility by saying "I didn't consent to the accident."  Similarly, if people have sex, they cannot avoid responsibility by saying "I didn't consent to pregnancy."
1.2.2.1.2.9.5.1. Con: This is a false analogy. When someone hits the accelerator, that is their choice. Sex, on the other hand, is not always consensual. If a woman is raped, then she can absolutely claim that she consented to neither sex, nor pregnancy.
1.2.2.1.2.9.6. Con: Arguing that in order for a woman to have sex she must consent to the possibility of pregnancy and therefore take responsibility by carrying the child is unreasonable. While biology dictates that women are the carriers of children, removing the means for a woman to end a pregnancy means restricting that woman to a child-rearing role even if it is not one she desires.
1.2.2.1.2.9.6.1. Con: Woman having to assume child-rearing role due to accidental pregnancy is no less unreasonable than a person having to work low-wage jobs because of lack of talent in better paying fields or means to get proper education towards it. People should bear responsibility for consequences of their actions.
1.2.2.1.2.9.6.1.1. Con: People at least have the option to cultivate their talents or acquire an education in some fashion. For half the population the possibility of child-rearing is a consequence they were born into rather than a responsibility that they actively chose.
1.2.2.1.2.9.6.1.1.1. Con: Most of the people in the world have no option to pursue education or cultivate their talent due to being born in to a poor family in a rural area of an undeveloped nation or other circumstances outside their control.
1.2.2.1.2.9.6.2. Con: This is an argument against biology. Women are already deemed the child-bearers by nature.
1.2.2.1.2.9.6.2.1. Con: Women have many other relevant roles in society and nature besides "child-bearer."
1.2.2.1.2.9.6.2.1.1. Con: This being true does not remove their critical to society role as child-bearers.
1.2.2.1.2.9.6.2.2. Con: Denying women the right to terminate pregnancies at an early stage implies that giving birth to children is the most important thing a woman will ever do; that her ability to give birth trumps any other contribution to [society](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/abortion-right-to-privacy-women-right-to-equality) she could possibly make.
1.2.2.1.2.9.6.2.2.1. Con: Having a child and making an important contribution to society "X" is considered greater than only doing "X". 
Also, having a child is one of the most important things one can do. Nevertheless, denying the possibility to abort an already conceived child does not mean that having a child is the only contribution said person could make.
1.2.2.1.2.9.6.2.2.2. Con: An implication must rely on an assumption which is not a universal truth. Many women who have made great contributions to society have done so as mothers. To assume that a woman's worth to society is lessened if she is a mother is incorrect.
1.2.2.1.2.9.6.2.2.3. Pro: Denying women access to safe, legal abortion in the interests of the embryo values the woman’s actual life less than the potential life of the embryo.
1.2.2.1.2.9.6.2.2.4. Con: Denial of the right to terminate a pregnancy says nothing about the relative importance of giving birth. This does not follow.
1.2.2.1.2.9.7. Pro: In the biological process of having sexual intercourse always lies the possibility to create life. If people want the freedom to have sexual intercourse without the purpose of procreating they also have to accept the obligation to care for the life they created even if they don't want to.
1.2.2.1.2.9.8. Con: Sex is between two people. Both are responsible for a pregnancy, not just women.
1.2.2.1.2.10. Con: No one 'forces' the woman to remain pregnant or give birth by not allowing them to abort. Force, by its very definition, requires further work or action on something. It is biology, not force of arms or law, that will compel the process of development to continue until birth. Refusal to permit a human to make a forceful change to nature is not the logical or ethical equivalent of a human or society forcing a natural process to remain.
1.2.2.1.2.10.1. Con: Under this idea, we should not treat cancer or other terminal illnesses and allow a natural process to remain. We shouldn't create rules to differentiate between the natural forces we can stop.
1.2.2.1.2.10.1.1. Con: This is a false equivalency. Cancer is not natural. The body is not made to handle cancer. Cancer serves no function. Cancer is a disease often contracted by contact with unnatural chemicals called carcinogens that alters the natural sequencing of a person's DNA into an unnatural one that causes unnatural growths in the body. There is nothing "natural" about cancer. Pregnancy on the other hand is the very definition of natural.
1.2.2.1.2.10.2. Con: Being prevented from doing something by the state, that you would otherwise be able to freely choose, is the same as being forced to do something you do not want to do.
1.2.2.1.2.10.2.1. Pro: In this instance, by making abortion illegal, the state is not allowing women to end a pregnancy which they desire to do so, which can be viewed as forcing them to remain pregnant.
1.2.2.1.2.10.2.1.1. Con: "A bans B from using force Z to escape state Y" is not a logical equivalent to "A forces B to remain in state Y." B is already in state Y, and A commits no force unless it first forced B into state Y.
1.2.2.1.2.10.2.1.1.1. Pro: If the state doesn't allow someone to opt out of life via suicide, it isn't forcing that person to remain alive. The person already is alive, and will remain that way. Rather, the state has banned the suicidal person's request to use force to change his/her state.
1.2.2.1.2.10.2.2. Con: Medical procedures are rarely things that someone has the freedom to just choose to do, regardless of whether the law allows a procedure or not. Many factors besides law affect them: availability, cost, ethics, health needs, etc.
1.2.2.1.2.10.2.3. Con: Being physically forced to do something you dislike and being legally prevented from an action you are theoretically capable of are not logical equivalents.
1.2.2.1.2.10.2.4. Pro: Being prevented from doing something is in effect the same as being forced not to do something. The result is that the situation is left unchanged, which in this case is carrying a baby.
1.2.2.1.2.10.3. Con: It is biology that determines that some people have poor eye sight. However, if the state made glasses or contact lenses illegal, it would be legitimate to say that it was the state forcing someone to continue having difficulty seeing.
1.2.2.1.2.10.3.1. Con: That would not be a legitimate statement, as force is opposed to leaving something at rest. Prohibition didn't force people to stay sober, it was their natural state sans alcohol. Rather, prohibition removed the legal option of drink. The only force comes in when someone then broke the law and was arrested.
1.2.2.1.2.10.3.2. Con: The government does temporarily ban, or rather prohibit, certain medicines from distribution for a time. This may be while the FDA approves a drug, or to protect the initial intellectual property of a pharmacy. Such actions banning a potential remedy do not constitute force on the people who remain in their sick state.
1.2.2.1.2.10.3.2.1. Con: Taking time to approve of a drug does not force people to remain in their sick state, because it is not yet known what the alternative is. Protecting intellectual property is not force, because another pharmaceutical company is necessarily selling a similar product. Neither one is comparable to banning a remedy solely because the government decides that remaining in the unwell state is preferable to the remedy.
1.2.2.1.2.10.3.3. Con: The analogy does not fit. Glasses are a non-invasive tool which people wear to remedy a specific problem with one of the human senses. Abortion is an invasive surgery that's purpose is to terminates a human life, not a physical tool, and is only rarely related to a specific health problem of the mother.
1.2.2.1.2.10.3.3.1. Con: The details of the condition and the modification are irrelevant to the discussion of whether or not forbidding modifications to a person's natural state constitutes forcing that person to remain in their natural state. Those may be reasons why it would be justified to force a person to remain in their natural state, but do not pertain to the definition of force.
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: People are put in situations they are not ready to face all the time. They deal with them successfully by learning and adapting rather than running away from them.
1.2.2.1.4. Pro: Overcoming challenges is what makes a person [great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sefscV3GvWM).
1.2.2.2. Pro: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16713893) of children born between 1961-63 investigated the adult mental health outcomes of those born to women who twice requested an abortion \(220 cases\) and compared to those whose mother did not request an abortion \(220 matched controls\). Significant differences in mental health outcomes were found between the two groups, all demonstrating worse outcomes for the "unwanted" children. This supports that being born from an unwanted pregnancy is a risk factor for poor mental health in adulthood.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: When abortion is allowed, the resulting children are killed. Death is a much harsher outcome than "a variety of social and psychological problems."
1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: The individual death of a semi- or non-conscious life isn't automatically a much harsher outcome than a civilization with a variety of social and psychological problems.
1.2.2.3. Con: A damaged, imperfect relationship / child would in most cases be better than no relationship / child.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Some women may not have the financial resources to go through a pregnancy and then support a child sufficiently.
1.2.2.4.1. Pro: Men are equally responsible for pregnancy but are often unwilling to fulfil their paternal role. When this occurs, an unplanned pregnancy can lead to socio-economic hardship for mother and child.
1.2.2.4.2. Con: This is an argument for the state providing more support for mothers rather than for allowing abortion.
1.2.2.4.2.1. Con: Humans live in societies, not in abstract environments devoid of constraints. Therefore, forgetting this environment would be a mistake: if the state is unable to provide support for mothers \(for any reason, let it be economic situation or established laws\), abortion would enable better financial survival of mothers.
1.2.2.4.2.2. Pro: The money spent on providing free or reduced cost abortion services can be spent on publicly funded aid for mothers and/or the children that were born as a result of an unwanted pregnancy.
1.2.2.4.3. Con: Throughout history most people lived in far poorer conditions, yet managed to raise more children per household than we do today.
1.2.2.4.3.1. Con: Demographics have changed. Even though birthrate was high at that time, death rate of children was also very [high](https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality). Therefore a lot of them were not raised, they died before maturity. On the contrary, today, it's no longer necessary to have a lot of children to ensure descendants.
1.2.2.4.3.2. Con: One of the reasons families were bigger in past centuries was because children could provide to the household economy at a much younger age and without having most of the qualifications that are necessary now. Nowadays having a child implies supporting them until they finish a degree and even that is no guarantee of success. The world simply does not work that way anymore.
1.2.2.4.3.2.1. Con: Supporting them until they finish a degree is an exaggeration. There are no age restrictions on certain types of jobs in the U.S. At 14, they can work limited hours at any non hazardous job. At 16, unlimited hours at any no hazardous job. At 18, unlimited at any job. If they choose college, there are grants loans that can pay their way if the parents can't.
1.2.2.4.4. Pro: [Research](https://www.ansirh.org/research/turnaway-study#results) by the University of California found that “turnaways,” meaning women denied abortions, were more likely to be in poverty two years later, compared to their peers who got the abortion services they sought.
1.2.2.4.5. Pro: Women who are denied abortions and instead give birth are [~3.8 times more likely to be in poverty](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2017.304247) and ~6.3 times more likely to be on public assistance 6 months after denial than women who received abortions. They are also more likely to be in poverty and remain on public assistance for 4 years after denial of abortion.
1.2.2.5. Pro: Some girls [regret having become pregnant](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38775641) as they were too young and too unsettled to have a child at that time.
1.2.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.3.1.1.1.
1.2.3. Con: A mother becoming less equipped to bring up her child post-birth would not be an acceptable justification for ending the child's life, therefore it should not be used as a justification pre-birth.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Just as it would be unethical to kill a toddler because of their situation, whether that be because that person is sick or that their parents are poor, it is also wrong to kill an unborn child for those reasons.
1.2.4. Pro: Abortions are often chosen as the least bad option available. Removing the least bad option is necessarily a step from bad to worse. If we consider abortion to be a bad thing, then we must focus on prevention and providing better options.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Worse options are situation specific but could include staying in an abusive relationship for support, dropping college/career plans to provide for the child, subjecting a new life to a severe handicap, or subjecting a new life to the foster care system.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: You cannot be certain that any or all of these are worse than no life at all. The foster care system, for example, likely would be much better than no life.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: It would be in the state's interest to have as few children taken away from their parents by Child Protective Services as possible. Denying these abortions would mean significant increases in public spending for various social care services. In the long term, this would cause more trouble than allowing a woman to have an abortion when she wants one.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Abortion and birth control are fiscally responsible. Spending $235 million on family planning [would save $1.32 billion](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/the-fiscal-conservatives-case-for-spending-more-money-on-birth-control/254442/).
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.5.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.2. Con: This source speaks only of birth control and spending money on contraceptive services being fiscally responsible not abortion.
1.2.4.2. Con: Contraception is both cheap and widely available. It also counts as prevention \(as opposed to abortion which is termination\), and is the better option, for it does not require ending a human life. Beside contraception, responsible behavior and attitude towards sexuality will also satisfy both points.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: Contraception is not cheap or widely available in many developing countries around the world, even in some parts of the [US](https://www.reproductiverights.org/project/contraceptive-access-in-the-united-states) and Europe.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: A small pack of condoms will cost you around 5€. Less developed countries may find contraception somewhat more expensive, however abortion procedures in those parts of the world are far more dangerous and costly, so prevention and abstinence are still the better options. To increase effectiveness and safety, one should compliment usage of contraception with proper sexual responsibility.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.1.
1.2.4.2.3. Con: If we draw the line at conception, then all hormone based contraceptive methods are abortions.
1.2.4.2.3.1. Con: Not all hormonal contraceptives are abortive. Many prevent ovulation, which means an egg is never released to be fertilized.
1.2.4.2.3.2. Pro: All hormone based contraceptive methods are potentially abortive in that sense, as they thicken the lining of the uterus preventing attachment of the fertilized egg \(some only in rare cases, but all do it\).
1.2.4.2.3.3. Con: It is true that if the human life truly begins at conception, then many \(not all\) hormone based contraceptive methods are abortions. However, this argument does not imply that human life doesn't start at conception.
1.2.4.2.3.4. Pro: If life truly were to begin at conception, IVF would also be highly immoral as multiple eggs are fertilized in vitro, and often not all of them used.
1.2.4.2.3.5. Con: The relationship between life termination by abortion versus other methods does not address the moral effect of termination. This branch leads away from the central question being asked.
1.2.4.2.4. Con: Contraception is not always the woman's choice, for example if the act is non-consensual.
1.2.4.3. Con: Believing an option is least bad, does not make it the least bad. For example, for some people suicide is perceived as the least bad option. This does not mean we should allow abortions nor suicide. This means that people should get help and support to prevent abortions and suicide, therefore putting a focus on prevention and providing better options.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: In the cases of suicide, the person is usually suffering from a mental condition that renders them unable to fully consider the implications of their actions.  An unwanted pregnancy is not a mental condition, nor is it legally recognized as a reason to ignore an individual's agency.
1.2.4.3.2. Con: There are cases where suicide may indeed be the least bad option: in end-of-life situations where the person is clear-headed but in extreme pain that cannot be fully eased.
1.2.4.3.3. Con: Broader "support" options should also be available for women facing this decision. Childcare is needlessly expensive and taxing. If people are so passionate about preserving life, we should be equally passionate about contributing to the quality of that life by supporting the mother with social programs and education. Both the mother and the child should be supported fully by a society that would uphold the "right" to life.
1.2.4.4. Con: Murder can never be described as the 'least bad' option.
1.2.4.5. Con: Better options have already been provided.
1.2.4.5.1. Pro: If a mother is incapable of raising her child, it is both the moral and legal duty of the government to look after the child. By choosing to legalize abortion, the government is washing its hands of this responsibility. The government should uphold the sanctity of fundamental rights to even the unborn child.
1.2.4.5.1.1. Con: This reasoning indicates that there are no responsible stakeholders but the individual and the government, which is not true. The larger family and the individuals' communities can and do take on responsibilities to help the parents. The government can be expected to create an environment where all the stakeholders are enhanced for the good of the parents and the children.
1.2.4.5.1.2. Con: Some governments, such as the American one, can't afford healthcare, let alone raising all the children that parents don't want.
1.2.4.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.2.5. Con: There is nothing for the mother to choose, because the life of of the child doesn't belong to her. She can choose to get pregnant or not, but once the child is conceived a new life is created. If a mother cannot kill her born child, she should not be able to kill an unborn one. It's a matter of principle. Life is more important than the mother's wishes.
1.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.7.1.1.5.1.
1.2.5.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.9.6.2.2.
1.2.5.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.
1.2.5.4. Pro: A woman isn't justified in killing a child just because she feels she has valid reasons. Murder is morally wrong.
1.2.5.4.1. Con: Forcing a woman to bear and care for an unwanted child is immoral as it could lead to harms for both the woman and the child.
1.2.5.4.1.1. Pro: Unwanted children are at higher risk for [abuse](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1936217) and neglect.
1.2.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: [This study](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/styles/scale_900x720/public/images/teenpregrates1280.jpg?itok=qWhlxzab) shows that the younger a mother is the more likely the child will be abused or neglected.
While [teen abortion is on the decline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4545632/) it still affects thousands of women a year.
1.2.5.4.1.2. Pro: Infant mortality is [increased in unplanned pregnancies.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK232137/)
1.2.5.4.1.2.1. Con: Mortality rates of the fetus are much higher when a mother chooses to have an abortion. Human life is still lost in either case.
1.2.5.4.1.3. Pro: Some women get involuntarily pregnant and are not capable, for many reasons \(economic, cultural, health etc\), of guaranteeing their children proper conditions in order to have a full human development, which can lead to lots of problems.
1.2.5.4.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.2.5.4.1.5. Pro: Unwanted children are more likely to become a burden on society in terms of reliance on welfare programs. [Welfare Reform and Abortion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230343/)
1.2.5.4.1.6. Con: If children born to parents who have had previous abortions become aware of their missing siblings they may feel like their lives are disposable. They may feel the reason they are alive is because they were not an inconvenience at the time they were conceived. This could possibly cause feelings of guilt since they survived and their sibling did not. This could be damaging to a person's psyche and would always be a factor in the trust of the parent/child relationship.
1.2.5.4.1.7. Pro: Women have a right to bodily autonomy and should ultimately be able to make choices about what happens to their bodies. Abortion should therefore be legal and accessible.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1. Con: The fetus is not part of the woman's body but a separate entity, and therefore the woman is not just making a decision about her own body when it comes to abortion.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.1. Pro: Abortion seeks to deliberately deprive a genetically distinct human of life, without giving [due process](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/due-process-of-law) to the unborn child such as allowing the child to [confront any accuser](https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/due-process/), to attend a hearing, to be judged by a jury of peers, etc.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: We avoid risk to life at almost any cost in numerous areas of life. At any moment between conception and birth, there is at least a risk that the foetus is a human being. Those who say a foetus is not a human life can only speculate, so the risk that abortion ends life remains. It's too big a risk for any sane society to allow.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.1.2. Pro: If the government can determine that some biological human beings, such as the unborn, don't have rights then we are all at risk of the majority deciding we--blacks, whites, Jews, gays, atheists, Christians, Muslims, the elderly, the differently abled, etc--don't have rights.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.1.2.1. Con: Many people in favour of access to abortion recognise a difference between a fetus and humans who have been born with regards to the rights they should be awarded. Therefore they are unlikely to support the removal of rights for these other groups.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.1.3. Pro: DNA from male and female merge within 12 hours of conception. The pronuclei merge and chromosomes begin to pair. This is where a new human genome is created. Willfully destroying this is willfully destroying a human.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.7.1.1.5.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.1.5. Pro: The value of a human life ought to be set by society, not arbitrarily by an individual.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.1.5.1. Con: If the value of human life is to be set by society, one possible "setting" of this value could be "unborn children are not valuable, as such people can choose to abort them". As such, the above statement is not really supportive of either of the position.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.1.5.2. Con: Society prohibits murder, robbery, rape etc because the harm and removal of liberty is self-evident. The harm of abortion to the fetus, relative to the harm to the mother, possibly her other children, and society, in forcing a mother to give birth, is not self evident. The question of who determines the fetus' worth should rest with the mother.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.2. Pro: The "right" to abort assumes that a baby is a part of its mother's body and not an independent human being, yet it has its own DNA, blood supply, feelings and thoughts. You don't get to choose to end another person's life just because it is inconvenient or even painful for you to allow it to live.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.2.1. Con: It does have it's own DNA, but "[feelings and thoughts](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-does-consciousness-arise/)" is a stretch. For the first two trimesters, the fetus lacks even the equipment that would be used for cognition. Even in the third trimester, that equipment goes unused until birth. A senseless sack of cells, utterly dependent on another organism for its existence, is a strange definition of "independent human being."
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.2.1.1. Con: Independence is not relevant when considering whether the child's life matters or not. The child is a distinct organism from the mother.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.3. Pro: It's understandable that a woman or a man should be allowed to decide what to do with their own body, but in this case women are also deciding what to do with a child's body and life, not just their own.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.7.1.1.5.1.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.5. Con: If the fetus is not part of a woman's body, the woman inherently has the right to remove it from her body.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.5.1. Con: The fetus is there directly because of the woman's actions.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.5.2. Con: It would be gross negligence to remove the infant from a mother. Just as it would be negligent to place a newborn outside the house because the house belongs to the mother, and she can decide what she wants in her house.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.6. Con: If it turned out that you are a unique kidney donor match for someone, it would be unthinkable for the law to force you to violate your bodily autonomy to save a life of "a separate entity".
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.6.1. Con: Being a match for a kidney is completely determined by chance whereas the child’s dependance on their mother to survive is a result of a decision made by the mother.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.7. Pro: A body being inside another body does not immediately grant combined autonomy to the host. For example, if person A puts their finger in person B's mouth, person B does not gain the legal right to bite and chop it off.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.8. Con: If a fetus is a "separate entity," then it is a parasite - an organism that can only survive by absorbing nutrients from another, host organism. To say that a woman cannot have an abortion because a fetus is a "separate entity" is to say they cannot have any other kind of parasite removed from their body.
1.2.5.4.1.7.1.8.1. Con: It doesn't make any sense to use the concept of parasitism applied to embryos, because reproduction is functional to the species.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2. Pro: Denial of abortion rights is simply another way in which the patriarchy attempts to control what women do with their own bodies.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.1.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.2. Con: Abortion is an instrument of the patriarchy. It's a way men can use women as objects of sexual pleasure and escape the responsibilities of fatherhood. Also, sometimes women decide to get an abortion because of pressure or threats from the father.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.2.1. Con: [A survey of 1209 abortion patients](https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2005/reasons-us-women-have-abortions-quantitative-and-qualitative-perspectives) found that fewer than 1% had abortions primarily because someone else insisted. Thus, in the majority of cases women would have their choice taken away by abortion being illegal, not legal.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.2.2. Pro: [A survey of 1000 women](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/01/31/sen-ted-cruz-democrats-are-now-so-radicalized-on-abortion-can-t-accept-any-limits-on-its-brutality.html) found 74% felt pressured by others while 30% chose abortion because they feared losing their man.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.3. Con: There are several things society forbids both men and women to do to their own bodies which has nothing to do with the patriarchy, including suicide, illegal drugs, hiring a doctor to remove limbs and deliberately infecting oneself with a lethal disease. Banning a given action, such as walking into a hospital for a specific medical procedure, doesn't necessarily show proof of the patriarchy of work.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.4. Con: There is [very little percentage difference](http://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/) between men \(42%\) and women \(38%\) who believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, or in the percentage of women \(59%\) and men \(55%\) who believe it should be legal in all/most cases. If the patriarchy is a factor at all, it is not a significant one.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.4.1. Con: There is a difference in the amount of men and women in [political positions](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/federal-employment-reports/reports-publications/executive-branch-employment-by-gender-and-racenational-origin/) that ultimately end up creating the laws surrounding these issues. The patriarchy isn't just ground-level, it's about a larger system of inherent bias, including positions of power \(aka the government\).
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.4.2. Con: Something being part of the patriarchy does not mean that it is believed or executed only or mostly by men. Slut-shaming is a clear example of this, being both an element of the patriarchal system and done by a vast number of women as well as men.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.5. Pro: Taking control of a woman's body from her amounts to slavery.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.6. Con: The principle that the unjustified taking of human life should always be illegal has nothing to do with gender.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.6.1. Con: Women always carry the physical burden of pregnancy because of their gender. In claiming that the patriarchy is trying to control women when our government is [predominately made up of men](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/federal-employment-reports/reports-publications/executive-branch-employment-by-gender-and-racenational-origin/) it does relate specifically to gender.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.7. Con: The patriarchy is an ambiguous and mythical construct.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.7.1. Pro: To raise the issue of the patriarchy within a discussion of abortion is a logical fallacy of begging the question/petitio principii [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question)  and/or red herring [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring). The argument assumes the patriarchy exists [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring), that it exists in some form that has motivations, and that those motivations are to control [4](http://Straw man). Definition of "the patriarchy" is needed. Examples of its control are needed and in a manner that's isolated from any other variable so that cause/effect can be identified.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.8. Pro: Women's ability to carry children and give birth does not mean she should be limited or restricted by her reproductive functions in ways which men are not.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.8.1. Con: Men and women are not the same. This is ok. Both have unique benefits and drawbacks.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.8.2. Con: We are all limited by our unique genetic make up including biological sex. Such differences do not carry an argument that action should be taken to nullify them. Diversity is not bad.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.8.3. Pro: By removing the ability of women to choose to opt out of pregnancies they do not desire, women become far more controlled by their reproductive systems.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.9. Pro: In patriarchal societies, women have experienced a great deal of violence that involves assaulting their bodies through domestic violence or sexual assault. Giving women control over their bodies is an important step in acknowledging that they, not men, should be able to determine what happens to them.
1.2.5.4.1.7.2.9.1. Con: Sexual assault and domestic violence are unfortunate. In these cases, the perpetrator should be given a fair trial and have to deal with appropriate punishments determined by the court. An abortion punishes a baby that had nothing to do with the crime.
1.2.5.4.1.7.3. Con: Legalised abortion could put some women in a position where they are coerced or forced to have an abortion that they do not want, which would also not give them bodily autonomy.
1.2.5.4.1.7.3.1. Pro: Legalized abortion gives parents an opportunity to blackmail their daughter to go through with an unwanted abortion.
1.2.5.4.1.7.3.2. Con: This is unlikely to be an issue in the vast majority of cases, and therefore it is still better to give women the ability to choose abortion, as many women want to, even though it may result in a small number being manipulated.
1.2.5.4.1.7.3.3. Con: Private consultations with doctors and psychologists in the process of getting an abortion could provide an opportunity for the woman to admit that she was uncomfortable with the decision and was being coerced.
1.2.5.4.1.7.3.4. Con: Being coerced or forced to have an abortion in itself deprives the right of bodily autonomy regardless whether abortion is legalised or not.
1.2.5.4.1.7.3.5. Con: The idea that we should remove bodily autonomy to prevent the potential loss of bodily autonomy is the most categoric example of an oxymoron.
1.2.5.4.1.7.3.6. Pro: Many women who do wish to remain pregnant have reported examples of being pressured harmed or threatened with harm by the biological father to get an abortion because he wants to avoid different types of responsibility or does not want other people in his life to know about the pregnancy . [stopforcedabortions.org](http://www.stopforcedabortions.org/docs/ForcedAbortions.pdf)
1.2.5.4.1.7.3.7. Con: It is far easier for someone to be forced into an illegal abortion \(due to the lack of criteria and consultation\) than it is to go through the process of obtaining a legal abortion without the coercion being picked up on.
1.2.5.4.1.7.3.8. Con: This argument is faulty since its application would require the same application to any other right. An example would be that nobody should be given religious freedom since someone could deny them that religious freedom. The possibility of wrongfully losing a right should not drive regulation against the right but motivate fighting the wrongful actuation.
1.2.5.4.1.7.3.9. Pro: Legal abortions encourage and enable misogyny. 16 Supreme court cases over the past 20 years bring evidence that the normalization and legalization of abortion has resulted in women being forced into abortion against their will, by the will of the men impregnating them. It is likely these cases are just the tip of the misogynistic ice-burg of coerced and forced abortions.[Forced Abortions \(Supreme Court Cases\)](https://www.pop.org/forced-abortions-in-america-case-before-supreme-court-2/)
1.2.5.4.1.7.4. Con: Bodily autonomy arguments for abortion logically allow the killing of babies right up to 40 weeks / immediately before birth. Therefore anyone who believes that abortions at 40 weeks are wrong should reject all bodily autonomy based arguments for abortion.
1.2.5.4.1.7.4.1. Con: Bodily autonomy decisions can be limited based on justification, eg. allowing abortion at 40 weeks only when there is immediate life-threatening danger to the mother and requiring no justification at all up until a certain point.
1.2.5.4.1.7.4.2. Con: Allowing a baby to die up to immediately before birth is a morally acceptable position and consistent with mainstream legal and moral positions. Many people would agree it is morally acceptable to deny a person your own kidney even if your lack of action would lead to their death. If you accept this it follows that it is morally acceptable to deny your fetus the support it needs to live if that support requires a breach of your bodily autonomy, which fetuses necessarily do.
1.2.5.4.1.7.4.2.1. Con: A foetus does not necessarily require a breach of the mothers bodily autonomy after 30 weeks in order to be removed and survive. Arguments that equate bodily autonomy with the death of the foetus between 30 and 40 weeks are therefore specious.
1.2.5.4.1.7.4.2.2. Pro: You can actually even allow your children to die after birth if your child would die without you donating an organ to them; you are never legally required to give your child that organ and could just let them die.
1.2.5.4.1.7.4.2.2.1. Con: By the end of the 8th week, all major organs have begun to develop in the baby. He or she needs the mom to provide nutrients, not give her organs. You can go to jail for starving your kids.
1.2.5.4.1.7.4.3. Pro: If a mother's choice to terminate her pregnancy is paramount and can be justified with as little as demonstrating that the child would have a negative effect on her life then the viability of the child to survive outside of the womb is irrelevant, and can be trumped even at full term by the mother's feelings.
1.2.5.4.1.7.4.3.1. Con: This same logic could be applied to babies, children, teenagers, and even adult children. The mother's feeling are not always what is most important and don't give her the right to kill anyone.
1.2.5.4.1.7.5. Con: Under-age abortions could result in legal debates regarding who has autonomy over a minor's body.
1.2.5.4.1.7.5.1. Pro: Minors have natural autonomy over their bodies and will do certain things regardless of controls inflicted upon them.
1.2.5.4.1.7.5.1.1. Pro: Maybe adults have too much control over minors.
1.2.5.4.1.7.5.1.2. Con: There are laws that say when a child is lawfully of age to choose sexual relations. Those same laws should apply to the age in deciding to having an abortion
1.2.5.4.1.7.5.2. Con: This question has already been resolved in most countries where abortion is legal either by statute or by case law.
1.2.5.4.1.7.5.2.1. Pro: In the [UK](http://www.healthcentre.org.uk/abortion/abortion-teenage.html) minors \(if they are seen as competent by medical staff\) are allowed to seek abortions without parental consent.
1.2.5.4.1.7.5.2.2. Pro: In [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minors_and_abortion), any woman of any age can get an abortion on request, with no reasons given, if she is less than 13 weeks pregnant, as long as she is able to give informed consent.
1.2.5.4.1.7.5.2.3. Pro: In [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minors_and_abortion) girls under 18 need parental consent.
1.2.5.4.1.7.5.2.4. Pro: In [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minors_and_abortion) parental consent is always required if the woman seeking abortion is a minor.
1.2.5.4.1.7.5.2.5. Pro: In [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minors_and_abortion) a minor does not require parental consent or notification except in Western Australia, where in the event of the woman being under 16 years of age one of her parents must be notified, except where permission has been granted by the Children's Court or the woman does not live with her parents.
1.2.5.4.1.7.5.2.6. Pro: In [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minors_and_abortion) parental authorisation is required if the woman is under 18.
1.2.5.4.1.7.5.2.7. Pro: In [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minors_and_abortion) a pregnant minor may ask for an abortion without consulting her parents first, but she has to be accompanied to the clinic by an adult of her choice. This adult must not tell her parents or any third party about the abortion.
1.2.5.4.1.7.5.2.8. Pro: In [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minors_and_abortion) girls under the age of 18 must get written permission from a parent or guardian before being allowed an abortion.
1.2.5.4.1.7.5.2.9. Pro: Minors are allowed to have abortions without parental consent in [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minors_and_abortion).
1.2.5.4.1.7.5.3. Con: Assuming the mother is conscious, there is no conceivable situation where in a fetus would have more legal autonomy over the mother's body than the mother, whatever the mother's age.
1.2.5.4.1.7.5.4. Con: Autonomy in medical decisions is distinct from legal autonomy \(age of majority, voting\), as established by different ages of consent for medical procedures even in countries without abortion legislation \(i.e. Canada\).
1.2.5.4.1.7.6. Pro: If women do not have the right to choose an abortion, someone else should not decide they have more of a right to deny them one. Those people do not have to live with the decision and it's likely they would be offended themselves if someone made a decision about how they should use their own bodies.
1.2.5.4.1.7.6.1. Pro: For very good reasons, we do not legally require a parent to donate a kidney to one of their children if that child will die without it. Abortion should both be as legal and morally reprehensible as refusing to donate a kidney to your dying child.
1.2.5.4.1.7.6.1.1. Con: An invasive procedure to transplant an organ is vastly different from childbirth because of the possibilities of multiple donors being available for the organ transplant. Additionally, removing a vital organ is different than removing a viable fetus. An organ, by itself, is not a human being. Thus, the analogy is false.
1.2.5.4.1.7.6.1.1.1. Con: The difference is technical, but ethically the analogy is legitimate. In both cases, a person is subject to an authoritarian decision about her own body to guarantee another person life.
1.2.5.4.1.7.6.1.1.2. Con: The number of valid donors doesn't change one's bodily autonomy over organ transplant, so it shouldn't hold sway here.
1.2.5.4.1.7.6.1.2. Con: A baby in the womb doesn't need an organ from the mother, only nutrients and oxygen. An abortion would be more correctly viewed as deciding you don't want to feed your child.
1.2.5.4.1.7.6.1.3. Pro: Not everything immoral should be made illegal. We do not make laws against *failing* to give other people food or shelter -- even though we may sometimes agree that it is immoral to withold food or shelter. It takes a great deal of art to decide when/if a person is morally culpable for withholding her/his property or body or time from a person in need. States are incapable of walking that line, so should make no laws mandating gifts of property or body or time to other beings.
1.2.5.4.1.7.6.1.3.1. Con: You can go to jail for failing to give your child food and [shelter](http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/child-neglect.html).
1.2.5.4.1.7.6.1.4. Con: It should be a legal requirement for one of the parents to give a kidney to their child if necessary.
1.2.5.4.1.7.6.1.4.1. Con: This is not tied to the debate at hand. At present, there is no legal requirement or obligation to do so.
1.2.5.4.1.7.6.2. Con: A judge in a court of law has every right to prescribe the necessary course of action, whether they would or wouldn't like to be on the receiving end of the same judgement. Their obligation is to the law, not to the defendant.
1.2.5.4.1.7.6.3. Con: By the same argument, an aborted child also has to live \(or rather die\) with their mother's decision and it's likely they would be far more offended themselves were they given the chance to be part of the discussion concerning their termination.
1.2.5.4.1.7.7. Con: After viewing an ultrasound, making them aware that it is a baby, [most](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/jul/12/rachel-campos-duffy/more-90-women-change-their-minds-about-having-abor/) [women](http://www.lifenews.com/2013/02/07/78-of-pregnant-women-seeing-an-ultrasound-reject-abortions/) will not choose abortion. This means the choice is often not fully informed, and may be a reason to restrict women's ability to choose.
1.2.5.4.1.7.7.1. Con: It does not follow that the choice is often not fully informed. What follows is merely that emotional manipulation is somewhat effective.
1.2.5.4.1.7.7.1.1. Con: An ultrasound is not emotional manipulation if it is only provided as part of the medical process. This simply gives more information to the woman who is making the decision.
1.2.5.4.1.7.7.2. Con: This is an argument for giving women the full information before they make their choice, but does not justify stripping them of the choice entirely.
1.2.5.4.1.7.8. Con: Women do not have the right to abortions universally, as it is not recognised as a fundamental human right.
1.2.5.4.1.7.8.1. Pro: Human rights are those rights which allow for the flourishing of all humanity. Choosing abortion prevents the flourishing of some of humanity \(i.e. the aborted\). Therefore, choosing abortion is not considered a human right.
1.2.5.4.1.7.8.1.1. Con: Human rights are a misdirected ideal: there are civil rights, not human rights and, those rights ought extend to all persons rather than exclusively to human persons or even humans that happen to not be persons.
1.2.5.4.1.7.8.1.2. Con: This is not the definition of human rights. Human rights are simply rights which every human has. Apart from that, the definition is very much a matter of opinion and belief. Hardly a good ground to base an argument on as the argument starts falling apart as soon as someone else counters it with their definition.
1.2.5.4.1.7.8.2. Con: The topic is how things should be, not how they are nor how they got to be this way.
1.2.5.4.1.7.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.
1.2.5.4.1.7.10. Con: A woman’s right to choose has become a tool in the hands of a man to further oppress a woman for his sake. A woman’s legal right to choose abortion brings with it expectations from men. It encourages and enables men to threaten or coerce women into abortions to further free the men from any consequence of a sexually free lifestyle. Men oppress women in this way regardless of the woman's actual desired choice.
1.2.5.4.1.7.10.1. Con: Pressure and expectations come with any social liberty. Men needing to take responsibility and contemplate consequences for their actions does not translate to needing to further restrict the rights of women.
1.2.5.4.1.7.11. Pro: Due to their unique ability to give birth to new life, women enjoy the privilege to decide over its fate. In blunt terms: a time-limited license to kill. The question is not whether abortion terminates life, but when and where this privilege ends and protection by law should kick in.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12. Pro: Women have a moral right to bodily autonomy.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.1. Pro: Women should have the inalienable right to pursue [happiness](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/abortion-right-to-privacy-women-right-to-equality), which includes the right to control their lives.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.1.1. Con: The right to pursue happiness should not trump one's duty to others. Women and men should make reasonable sacrifices to accommodate the needs of others. If men had an absolute right to pursue their own happiness and control their lives, then men would be permitted to skip child support payments.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.9.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.1.3. Pro: The responsibility of carrying and having a child in many cases falls on the mother, as fathers may not be in the picture or may not want to be involved. Having a child then changes a woman's entire life and her ability to pursue her idea of happiness in a way that does not happen to men.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2. Pro: [Sovereignty](http://torstone.org/featured-articles/what-is-body-sovereignty) begins with the individual. As a result and without reservation, one has absolute right over their own body.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1. Con: Individuals live in societies and society makes decisions that affect individuals. Individuals cannot do everything they might like to do; society imposes rules for the good of all and could not function if individuals claimed precedence. There can be no blanket rule that allows individuals \(male or female\) do whatever they want to do. Society must debate and deliberate, review and rule.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.1. Con: This implies that society is harmed because of abortions, and that it benefits society for children to be born. If a child is born to an impoverished family, it is doubtful it will be beneficial to society.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.1.1. Pro: There is evidence to suggest that the Roe v. Wade decision to legalize abortion in 1978 was responsible for the [dramatic decrease](http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/DonohueLevittTheImpactOfLegalized2001.pdf) in violent crime the United states experienced through at least 1999.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Five US states legalised abortion three years before Roe v. Wade. Crime started falling three years earlier in these states, with property crime \(done by younger people\) falling before violent [crime](http://freakonomics.com/2005/05/15/abortion-and-crime-who-should-you-believe/).
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: After Roe v. Wade, the availability of abortions differed widely across US states. From the period 1985-1997, when the post-Roe generation was reaching peak crime ages, the states where abortion was more readily available saw a 30% decline in crime relative to states with low levels of [availability](http://freakonomics.com/2005/05/15/abortion-and-crime-who-should-you-believe/).
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: When we compare arrest rates of people born in the same state, just before and just after abortion legalisation, we once again see the identical pattern of lower arrest rates for those born after [legalisation](http://freakonomics.com/2005/05/15/abortion-and-crime-who-should-you-believe/) than before.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: There is evidence from Canada, Australia, and Romania that also supports the hypothesis that abortion reduces [crime](http://freakonomics.com/2005/05/15/abortion-and-crime-who-should-you-believe/).
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.1.1.5. Pro: Studies have shown a reduction in infanticide, teenage drug use, and teenage childbearing consistent with the theory that abortion will reduce other social ills similar to [crime](http://freakonomics.com/2005/05/15/abortion-and-crime-who-should-you-believe/).
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.1.1.6. Con: To not take into account the increase in law enforcement, both in terms of numbers of personnel, advanced weaponry, and tactics, and to not take into account the dramatic increase in incarcerations during this same period, in a discussion of decreased criminality, seems egregious.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.1.1.7. Pro: Research correlates legalized abortion to a [lower rate of violent crime](http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/DonohueLevittTheImpactOfLegalized2001.pdf).
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.1.2. Con: Many children born to impoverished families have ended up being beneficial to [society](https://www.quora.com/Who-are-some-notable-examples-of-people-who-were-born-poor-but-still-went-on-to-achieve-wonders-and-what-were-the-reasons-behind-how-their-life-changed-at-one-point-in-time).
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.2. Con: There is a limit between what is considered private domain and public domain. Regulations regarding ones body should not be imposed, unless there is a direct thread to society, such as, for example, a danger of epidemic outbreak. This rhetoric does not apply to this case. It is an intrusion on personal freedom originating from religious dogmatism.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.3. Con: It's naive to think that the "society" acts only for the common good. The "society" has a dominant class, and that usually is the one who decides for the poor people, in favor of their own interest. Many abortions are practised by wealthier people in high level private clinics, without risks and without social or legal consequences, while the lower class citizens get abortions on dangerous places, risking their lives. This is a normal day situation in [South America's hospitals](http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1396232-las-cifras-del-aborto-clandestino-en-el-pais).
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.4. Con: This does not explain from where society derives sovereignty over an individual citizen's body. The assumed right over another individual's corpus is groundless.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.5. Pro: The state limits bodily autonomy and the actions of individuals through laws such as banning drugs, in recognition that this is best for society.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.5.1. Con: This statement works against itself. We are currently overpopulating the planet. In this light, limiting birth rate is what is best for society, and abortion works in parallel to this goal, as reflected in China's "one child" policy. Saying regulation is good for society, therefore women should not have freedom about they bodies, therefore abortion should be banned is a fallacy.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.5.1.1. Con: Overpopulation has been discussed in another branch. If this is your only measure in determining what is best for society, killing others would also work in parallel to the goal. Using overpopulation as a justification for killing is a fallacy.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.5.1.2. Con: A sustainable birth rate for a population is  2.1 children per couple. However birth rates in developed countries has dropped [well below this mark](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255510/), as it is far more common for couples to have a single child or no children. This means any fears of over population are unfounded and abortion in no way makes up for this drop in birth rates which is attributed to societal expectations and contraception.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.5.2. Pro: Legally, you can't do anything you want to with your body. For example, prostitution, or driving naked is illegal in many places.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.6. Con: Society cannot trample the individual on a whim. It is generally recognized that the individual has specific rights that society cannot overrule without what is referred to in law as an "overriding state interest".
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.2. Pro: For an individual to be free, she must have agency. Agency requires having control over what happens to her body. Allowing women to choose whether to have an abortion or not maintains their agency, and thereby their freedom to control their own lives.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.3. Pro: The fetus cannot survive without the mother’s body nurturing it. When the law imposes this labor on a woman, it effectively enslaves her for the duration of the pregnancy. She cannot leave this responsibility. The law makes the fetus’s life more important than her liberty, instead of treating her as an moral end in herself, the law treats her body as a means to an end that she has not chosen.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.3.1. Con: It's not the law who imposes the labor, but nature. The mother had the liberty to get pregnant \(unless in cases of rape\), so she has the responsibility to develop the fetus's life.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.3.2. Con: The born baby, too, cannot survive without the mother's body nurturing it. If that argument legitimated abortion, then it should also legitimate infanticide.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4. Con: Individual liberty ends where another individual's liberties begin. As biology holds that a human life begins at conception, regardless of where one stands on the personhood or value of that life, the woman's freedom to make choices cannot supersede the liberty and rights of the human life inside her.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.1. Con: A baby's life begins at conception but its liberty begins at birth. Until then its life depends on the mother's choices just like her own life. In fact they are biologically one.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.1.1. Con: Biology does not treat them as one organism, but two [separate and distinct human organisms](https://www.kialo.com/should-women-have-the-right-to-choose-abortion-5637/5637.0=5637.1-5637.2+5637.371). While present in the mother's body, the fertilized egg is not part of the body and never becomes part of the mother's body. It travels through the fallopian tube entirely independent of the mother's nutrients until it attaches via placenta into the womb.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: A car traveling through a tunnel does not make it one with the tunnel, and a gasoline line does not make a car one with a gas station.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The car stays the same while it travels through the tunnel, and it is able to function as a car inside and outside the tunnel. This is not a good analogy of the fetus-mother relationship, as the fetus is constantly developing inside the mother's body, and it is not capable of functioning independently before it is born \(and, in fact, for a long time after\).
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: The unborn human has its [DNA set from conception](https://www.babycenter.com/2_inside-pregnancy-your-babys-dna_10354440.bc). While similar to the mother's and father's due to inherited chromosomes and genetic traits, the DNA is not the same as the mother's.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.1.2. Con: Even after birth, the baby is still dependant on the mother. It is even more dependant because no longer feeds by itself from the mother's nutrients as it did during pregnancy.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.2. Con: Modern society could not sustain a position of individual liberty before birth. These individuals would need to be identified \(i.e. Social Security numbers\) and provided with the rights and applicable services of other born individuals.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.3. Con: Choosing to cease bodily support of any individual inside or outside a womb does not supercede that individuals liberty or rights. If a dying man needs my kidney to survive, I am not violating his liberty or rights by choosing to not to donate it to him. By the same standard if a fetus requires my bodily support to live I am not violating it's liberty or rights by withholding that support. Thus this argument has no bearing on the conversation.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.3.1. Con: Failure to donate one of your kidneys that might potentially save a dying life is not analogous to deliberately terminating the life of a healthy, developing human.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.3.2. Con: Abortion is not 'withholding support.' It is deliberately killing another human life. While that might have a side effect of that human no longer using the mother's resources, abortion is not equivalent to withholding resources. The child doesn't die from the mother withholding support; he dies by pill, saline, dismemberment, or some other method.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.3.3. Con: If you connect someone to a machine that they cannot disconnect from for a time without dying, that doesn't confer a moral right to then disconnect the person just because it was your machine.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.4. Con: If a woman does not consent to the presence of the fetus inside her body, it is trespassing in a place where it has no right to be. The woman can revoke consent and evict the trespasser without infringing on it's right to life or liberty.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.4.1. Con: A trespasser is someone who comes into an area that they have no claim to from the outside without permission. Someone who is placed into an area without their explicit permission is not a trespasser. And as the natural reproductive process has the new human life implant into the mother's womb, it can't be said that the new human has no natural right to be there.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.5. Pro: Someone cannot choose to use his or her hand to kill or steal from another without consequence.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.6. Pro: When women make that choice they decide both over their own body and over the baby's body. Yes, the woman has a right to bodily autonomy - but so should the baby.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.6.1. Con: Everyone has the right to bodily autonomy "at some point". [Autonomy](http://Autonomy is defined as "freedom from external control or influence") is defined as "freedom from external control or influence". Minors, for example, typically would not have bodily autonomy until they reach some arbitrary age of maturity. It is the parents that essentially decide what goes on and in a child's body until a certain age. In most cases, children cannot refuse medical treatment because it is deemed that they lack the competency to make those decisions, even if it is their own body.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.6.2. Con: It would be quite a stretch to say that an unborn fetus is autonomous simply due the fact that it cannot sustain itself without the mother. Autonomy means free from external control. A fetus born at [23 weeks has a 25% of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability), and has to rely on the mother for at least that long. Even thereafter, the fetus still cannot sustain life without the assistance of others.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.7. Pro: In the [~87% of cases](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/psrh/full/3711005.pdf) where rape \(1%\) and maternal health \(12%\) were not cited as reasons for the abortion, bodily autonomy of the mother does not usurp bodily autonomy of the fetus.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.5. Con: The individual begins at conception. From that point on it is a seperate organism with it's own unique DNA. By your own logic as well as mine it should have sovereignty.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.3. Pro: The [first human right](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) says: "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights." Therefore women are free to choose, should be treated with dignity, and have the right to decide regarding their own bodies.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.3.1. Con: The terminology used is chosen by humans and does not change the inalienable truth that one human being is hosting another human being, that is being pregnant. There are two bodies, not one. One is helping the other until it can help itself. The helpless human being needs to be treated with dignity also.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.3.2. Pro: As a fetus is not a human being by the UN or biological standards and a pregnant woman is, it is only logical her rights to freedom of choice and life are protected, as an unwanted pregnancy can very much destroy not one but two lifes.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.3.3. Con: Appealing to authority isn't an argument but a fallacy.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4. Pro: Decisions which largely impact on an individual and their body should ultimately be made by that individual rather than by the state.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.1. Pro: To move the right to determine one's fate from the individual to the state, even in the case of saving another's life, accepts the possibility of forced abortions, forced organ donations, and other horrors. The individual must be able to choose their own fate.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.1.1. Con: The state proscribes the boundaries within self determination can operate to be those that do not harm others.  Those boundaries are the limits of the right to determine ones fate but do not move the right to the state, but protect others who might be affected by our choices.  I can buy an axe but I cannot legally wield it at another.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.2. Pro: Women should be able to judge for themselves what the best option is. Abortion could either be a painful or a liberating action. In both cases a huge emotional cost is involved, thus the right should be granted. It's not an easy way out, but rather the easiest in some cases.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.2.1. Con: The personal cost of alternative courses of action do not make them meritorious. The certainty of grave harm to another individual is a more relevant factor in limiting freedom of choice than costs to the chooser.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.3. Pro: The boundary of the law must stop at the skin. If the law does not respect a hard objective boundary then it is limited only by the political goals of the power elite who makes them. Legislators would be free to control what you may or may not want to do with your body: immunizations, tattoos, dietary restrictions, sexual preferences, drug usage \(or abstinence\), surgical procedures and more. If you want to be free then you must extend that right to others.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.3.1. Con: The higher principle is 'my liberty ends where yours begins'. The law can stop at the skin only provided to do so does not affect the liberty of another person.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.4. Con: Decisions regarding major surgery generally involve more than just someone wanting the surgery. Someone with body integrity disorder couldn't just walk in and ask a leg to be lopped off, for example. The doctor's opinion, insurance, and even the regulation of the state are all factors - not just the individual's opinion.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.4.1. Con: In many instance individuals are able to decide to have plastic surgery, and as long as a doctor deems the procedure safe, would perform the surgery if requested.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.4.2. Con: The doctor's opinion can matter while still allowing the decision to be largely in the hand of the individual. Doctor's often do still have to sign off on abortions being performed and will provide the individual with all the information prior to the procedure.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.4.2.1. Con: Doctors do not always give full information to a patient, or do so with enough time for the mother to make an informed decision.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: Many pro-choice organizations such as Planned Parenthood fight laws which would make it mandatory for Doctors to fully inform the patient of risks and options before an abortion procedure with enough time allowed for the patient to make an informed decision.
[thehill.com](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/354899-aclu-planned-parenthood-sue-missouri-over-new-abortion-law)
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.4.2.1.2. Pro: Some states allow or are seeking to allow doctors to withhold information on the health of the fetus if they believe it will increase the mother's chances of aborting.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.5. Con: If decisions which largely impact the individual and his/her body shouldn't ethically be made by the state, then the state shouldn't ethically be able to give one individual the right to terminate a different individual who did not grant consent.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.5.1. Con: There are two conflicting rights here: the right of a fetus to be carried to term, and the right of a person to their bodily autonomy. This argument puts one forth as a right, and simply doesn't mention the other. For it to be a valid argument, it would be necessary to state why the conflict is resolved in favor of the fetus and not the mother.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.6. Pro: The state allows me to choose whether to protect life in many situations. I am not required to donate blood, although lives are at stake. I am not required to put my life at risk to protect my own child, after that child is born. There is no general principle of which the state's assertion of control over a woman's body is a specific example. Therefore, regardless of the moral status of the act of abortion, there is no basis for the state restricting it.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.6.1. Con: The state does have power to prevent actions that harm others, rather than as you argue compelling actions to prevent harm. The two are not the same.  The law cannot compel me to jump in and save a drowning man, but it can intervene if I take actions to drown him.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.4.6.2. Con: You are not required to put your life at risk to protect your child but you are required by law to take care of it. Your argument supports the case for abortion where there is a high likelihood of death to the mother, but does not support a general right to choose abortion.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.5. Con: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.6. Con: Autonomy does not free one from consequences. I have the bodily autonomy to buy a dog, or not to buy a dog, but that does not free me from the responsibility of caring for a dog which I buy. Women have autonomy in choosing to have sex. They do not have autonomy in choosing not to deal with the consequences.
1.2.5.4.1.7.12.7. Con: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.
1.2.5.4.1.7.13. Con: Women have an obligation to provide due care for the unborn human since they \(and the father\) created the unborn human's biological dependence on the mother's body.
1.2.5.4.1.7.13.1. Pro: Many states punish pregnant mothers who deliberately pursue activities, such as illegal drug use, that they know will cause injury or disability to the unborn. [These laws](https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee_Opinions/Committee_on_Health_Care_for_Underserved_Women/Substance_Abuse_Reporting_and_Pregnancy_The_Role_of-the-Obstetrician-Gynecologist) are based on the premise that the life of the child matters and mothers have an obligation to care for the unborn. Given this is the case, it seems principally consist to insist that women do not have a right to choose abortion, since this would also harm the life of the unborn child.
1.2.5.4.1.7.13.2. Con: Asserting that a woman holds a duty of care invites the question: if the duty of care is violated, what is the injury? If I negligently leave water on the floor, but no one is hurt, I have not committed a tort. The fetus lacks any of the qualities we would consider when asking what makes life valuable. Therefore it has lost nothing of value through its abortion, rendering irrelevant any breach of the duty of care the woman may have committed.
1.2.5.4.1.7.13.3. Con: Many times the creation of the fetus was no more intended by the mother than by the fetus. Without intent to enter it a contract is typically considered void.
1.2.5.4.1.7.13.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.9.
1.2.5.4.1.7.13.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.
1.2.5.4.1.7.14. Pro: Women have a legal claim to a right to abortion.
1.2.5.4.1.7.14.1. Pro: Banning abortion betrays the role of government as preserving liberty as stated in [the Declaration of Independence](http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/).
1.2.5.4.1.7.14.2. Pro: To preserve bodily autonomy for men in all cases, and not women in all cases, is a violation of the [Equal Protection Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause) of the 14th amendment.
1.2.5.4.1.7.14.2.1. Con: There is a key difference in the case of abortion, in that a women is not acting only upon her body, but also upon a body of another human being by killing them.
1.2.5.4.1.7.14.2.2. Pro: Women should have full agency just as men have. To suggest that women “not be allowed” to do something infers that women are somehow unable to make choices. That inference is demonstrably false.
1.2.5.4.1.7.14.2.3. Con: This argument would only be valid if both men and women could get pregnant and men were allowed abortions while women were denied the same.
1.2.5.4.1.7.14.3. Pro: Individual freedom is the basis of the [US constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution). Freedom of speech, religion, from self incrimination, and unlawful searches are all guaranteed. There is no right more fundamental then the choices we make about our own bodies. If we do not have that right, then none of the others matter. By allowing a woman to choose, you are not condoning the action, you are only ensuring that you will have the right to make your own choices.
1.2.5.4.1.7.14.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.
1.2.5.4.1.7.14.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.5.2.
1.2.5.4.1.7.14.3.3. Pro: In Roe v. Wade the Supreme Court literally decided that [bodily autonomy was an unenumerated right](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=4757&context=uclrev)that could be inferred from privacy protections in the constitution.
1.2.5.4.1.7.14.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.6.1.
1.2.5.4.1.7.14.5. Con: The legal right to "Bodily Autonomy" descends from [McFall v. Schimp,](http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~ras2777/judpol/mcfall.html) which established the precedent that the state could not violate one person's liberty by compelling them to perform medical procedures, even in order to save the life of another.  While this is frequently used to support abortion, this is faulty, as pregnancy is not caused by the state, and the only medical procedure is abortion, which violates a fetus's life and liberty for the benefit of the mother.
1.2.5.4.1.7.14.5.1. Con: Control over one's own body is "bodily autonomy".  Whether the state requires or denies the choices of an individual with what to do with their own body it is interference with bodily autonomy.
1.2.5.4.1.7.14.6. Con: Appeal to authority isn't an argument but a fallacy.
1.2.5.4.1.7.15. Con: This argument is self-refuting because abortion denies the same autonomy to the unborn human being.
1.2.5.4.1.7.15.1. Con: The exercise of autonomy requires a will. A woman seeking an abortion has the will and intention to free herself of an unwanted pregnancy. The government preventing her from obtaining an abortion is therefore an infringement on her autonomy. A fetus has a biological directive to continue growing and eventually become a human, but it lacks the conscious thought required to possess the will or intention necessary for the abortion to be a denial of its autonomy.
1.2.5.4.1.7.16. Pro: The only reliable basis we have on which to consider this issue is in relation to a woman's right to bodily autonomy.
1.2.5.4.1.7.16.1. Pro: We lack the necessary philosophical understanding to determine conclusively when sentience begins in a meaningful way.
1.2.5.4.1.7.17. Con: The voluntary taking of human life is considered in most societies to be murder \(except in circumstances of war or punishment\) therefore a woman isn't justified in killing a child just because the child is in and could be considered to be part of her body.
1.2.5.4.1.7.17.1. Con: "Taking" is an important word here. Murder is evil because it is taking life away from someone who wishes to remain alive. A fetus is unconscious. It has no conception of life, living, or the self. Anything that makes life valuable - that makes the deprivation of life evil - is absent from the fetus. Therefore nothing real has been taken from an aborted fetus.
1.2.5.4.1.7.18. Pro: If women were denied the right to bodily autonomy based on the perceived needs of others \(fetuses\), then any healthy individual in society could potentially have their body used for other people's well-being. If a woman's body is not her own, then nobody's body is their own. Such a society would be deeply unpleasant.
1.2.5.4.1.7.18.1. Con: The mother/fetus relationship in an abortion is unique to most other intra-personal relationships in that the mother is the one trying to infringe on the fetus's bodily autonomy. A person who infringes on another's bodily autonomy necessarily forfeits their own.
1.2.5.4.1.7.19. Con: No person is wholly their own and no act exists inside a bubble. Suicide is considered a selfish act because it impacts those who associate with the suicidal person. To terminate the growth of what will become an independent person is a decision that impacts many more people than just the mother. It is therefore not an independent act and society has the right to coin in their objections of the practice.
1.2.5.4.1.7.19.1. Con: The other people who could possibly be impacted by the potential person have a mere expectancy interest - there is a chance that they may be impacted by the existence or absence of the expected person, but it is not guaranteed that such an impact will exist \(let alone that it is a positive impact!\). By contrast, the woman has an actual, present interest in her bodily autonomy; the woman's actual interest should therefore outweigh any expectancy interests that may exist.
1.2.5.4.1.7.20. Pro: If the government is given the power to tell women they have to give birth, the next logical step is that the government will have the authority to tell us we can’t have children or another scenario where the government tells us when to have our children and how many children we can or cannot have. The government has no place in a woman’s vagina.
1.2.5.4.1.7.20.1. Con: This argument would be valid if the woman were forced to get pregnant and provide children to the State. Government does not have this authority; it has solely the responsability for protecting a resistless life.
1.2.5.4.1.7.21. Con: Bodily autonomy is an arbitrary and protean concept. There is no justification possible for ''rights''.
1.2.5.4.1.7.21.1. Con: Rights are easily justifiable through utilitarianism: recognizing the right to bodily autonomy creates something the law and its enforcers must protect. One of the most basic protections would be against battery, which causes suffering. Thus, suffering is reduced by recognizing bodily autonomy.
1.2.5.4.1.7.21.2. Con: Subjective concepts exist within a social context and claiming that they don't exist doesn't add anything meaningful to the discussion.
1.2.5.4.1.7.22. Pro: The laws have to organise life and interactions between the citizens, but it's not supposed to control your personal life. If a woman doesn't want to be a mother, she won't, and it's her own and only business. Finally, a woman has no right to decide for other women.
1.2.5.4.1.7.23. Con: Bodily autonomy is not an unlimited or absolute right.
1.2.5.4.1.7.23.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.
1.2.5.4.1.7.23.2. Pro: This would also mean all women must be granted the legal right to suicide. They must also have the right to have the suicide process be medically accessible, with the only basis or reason for requesting the suicide being 'it is my body, I have the right to bodily autonomy, so I can do with my body as I wish'.
1.2.5.4.1.7.23.2.1. Con: The majority of Americans [support access to euthanasia](https://news.gallup.com/poll/211928/majority-americans-remain-supportive-euthanasia.aspx), which essentially does grant people control over their bodies to the extent that they can have support in ending their lives. It is possible bodily autonomy should be extended to allow this.
1.2.5.4.1.7.23.2.1.1. Con: Physician Assisted Suicide \(PAS\) is still illegal in nearly all states. Regardless, a core tenet of ethical arguments to allow PAS to be legalised always have 'motivation' as a primary consideration. Generally, the motivation must include a physician's diagnosis of a terminal illness, and with [six months or less to live](https://euthanasia.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000132). Furthermore, with abortion the woman is making a decision over someone else's life and not just her own, this is not the case with PAS.
1.2.5.4.1.7.23.3. Con: Even if bodily autonomy is not a right which is unlimited or absolute, it can only be limited, restricted, or infringed upon for an extremely compelling purpose \(other than what the given law says must happen\) using means very narrowly tailored to achieving that purpose. That test cannot be met by an abortion ban.
1.2.5.4.1.7.24. Pro: Giving women autonomy over her body via reproductive rights is the only known [universal](https://www.unfpa.org/press/ensuring-reproductive-health-and-rights-would-go-long-way-overcoming-poverty-new-report-says)[cure](https://www.ippf.org/news/announcements/sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-rights-are-crucial-ending-poverty) for [poverty](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775139/).
1.2.5.4.1.7.25. Pro: We do not give people the right to use other's people's body to use or sustain them without express and ongoing consent. If women want to remove that consent, they should be able to do so by having an abortion.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.1. Con: The geographical overlap of woman and child is unfortunate but not determinative of the moral issues involved in terminating the life of a preborn baby. Consent only applies here if one can show that enveloping another being's body creates a cessation of rights for anything enveloped. If one cannot show such a cessation of rights, ongoing consent here is meaningless for this discussion.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.2. Con: The mother's body created the egg inside the ovary. The mother's body ejected the egg from the ovary into the fallopian tubes. The father's sperm attached to the egg. The egg was fertilized by the mother's egg and father's sperm at some point in the fallopian tubes. At no point in this did the egg, sperm, or newly formed human life do anything to the mother's body without her consent as they were reactive parties to the natural biologic functions and actions of both parents.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3. Pro: A fetus's right to life does not imply the right to use the mother's body to sustain its life.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.1. Pro: People do not have a right to use another's body in order to remain alive. For example, we do not require people to donate their organs even though doing so could prevent deaths.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.1.1. Pro: If my brother requires daily blood transfusions to live I have no legal or moral obligation to give them my blood. It is the same if my fetus requires daily bodily support to live: I have no legal or moral obligation to give my bodily support.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.1.1.1. Con: The situations are not functionally equivalent as the mother's body naturally sends nutrients regardless of her intellectual or legal consent, whereas doctors will only remove blood by written consent. One is a naturally occurring process, whereas the other is artificial.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.1.1.2. Con: These scenarios are not functionally or ethically equivalent, as your brother would not be dependent on your blood due to your own actions, but rather due to natural disease or some other outside factor.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.1.1.3. Con: The scenarios are not ethically equivalent, as the law does not give someone legal permission to stop someone's IV or prohibit someone from receiving nutrients. The law also does not give permission to kill your brother so he cannot receive any blood from you in the future. There is a large difference between not donating something that is yours and terminating someone so they cannot receive anything of yours.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.2. Con: You always have a duty to someone you have placed in a precarious situation.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.2.1. Con: This makes two assumptions that aren't safe. One is that the mother has placed the fetus in this position. There are many reasons she might not have. The other is that, if she does have an obligation to the fetus, that obligation extends to risking her life for the fetus as well as serving as the fetus's entire life support system for the length of the pregnancy, not providing life support but being the human life support. It's unclear whether, if obligations exist, they extend this far.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.3. Con: The mother's body naturally provides nutrients and is designed for the housing and development of the prenatal human life. The process is automatic. It is not ethically wrong for the fetus to accept the nutrients the mother's body naturally offers.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.4. Con: Someone existing in an environment and taking nutrients at someone else's instigation for a predetermined period of time does give them an implied right to continue to do so barring breach of law or contract; the man in the iron lung at the hospital, the tenant at a bed and breakfast, the patron at a restaurant, the child learning from his teacher, the sick woman with a walking IV, etc.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.5. Pro: In Judith Jarvis Thomson's famous [violinist example](http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/Phil160,Fall02/thomson.htm), she argues that people would be outraged if upon waking up they found themselves plugged to an ailing violinist and told that in order for the violinist to remain alive, they must remain plugged to them for the next nine months.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.5.1. Con: No outside person or force is forcibly plugging the mother to another human.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.5.2. Con: Even if someone was horrifically kidnapped and attached to an ailing violinist, it would not justify murder of the other victim vs. outrage at the kidnapper.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.5.3. Con: The human life inside the mother is growing, not ailing. It would be ailing if killed or removed prematurely.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.5.3.1. Con: Ailing is not the relevant part of the analogy.  Dependency is the relevant part.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.5.4. Con: The violinist example is not analogous because withdrawing support is very different from directly killing and the kidnapped person didn't create the violinists dependency on their body whereas the biological parents make the unborn human biologically dependent on the mother's body thereby creating an obligation to provide due care.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.5.4.1. Con: There are two assumptions here- first: that withdrawing support is different from direct killing. This distinction is unclear at best, since both cases involve a decision \(terminate life\) causally connected to a consequence \(termination of life\). Second: that biological parents choose to create life, which confers obligations. This is also unclear; many pregnancies are accidental, and even if they weren't, you should be allowed to change your mind after experiencing the realities of pregnancy.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.5.4.2. Con: The mother did not take someone independent from her body and make that person dependent on her body. She brought someone into existence as a person dependent on her body. If you take someone who was independent on you and make them dependent on you, then you'd be responsible for them, as you deprived them of their independence. But when it's not your fault that they're dependent, since they would be non-existent, not-independent, if it weren't for you, you don't have the same responsibility.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.4. Pro: For this reason, even if a fetus has rights, they do not extend to being able to demand somebody else sustain their life, as this is not a right we award to anyone.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.4.1. Con: It is a right we often afford in cases where initial consent or action implies continued consent for a reasonable time period.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.4.1.1. Pro: A man with a sign posted on his private land allowing cars to travel over a private bridge cannot suddenly blow up the bridge with cars on it as he 'removed consent.'
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.4.1.2. Pro: A person renting out a property cannot evict a tenant suddenly and without reason, since the initial lease determined the period of mutual consent so long as both parties follow the terms.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.4.1.3. Pro: A sick person in the hospital cannot be removed from life-support and ejected from the hospital if the doctor doesn't want to continue treating him.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.4.1.4. Pro: A college can't expel a student for the sole reason that it no longer consents to teach the student.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.4.1.5. Pro: A bus driver cannot kick everyone off the bus solely because he doesn't consent to drive them.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.4.1.6. Con: However we also accept that assuming consent is ongoing can be problematic, particularly when it is directly related to the use of another's body, such as in the case of sexual relationships. In these instances we allow consent to be removed.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.4.2. Con: The child is completely independent of the mother's resources to sustain life as it travels down the fallopian tubes. It would not make sense for the new human life to have rights due to independence but then lose them due to later taking nutrients.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.4.3. Con: The mother's body naturally sends nutrients to the fetus. That she might not consciously approve of this doesn't mean the fetus is violating her rights by [accepting the nutrients offered](https://www.kialo.com/argument/5637.335).
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.4.4. Con: The fetus accepting offered nutrients is not [demanding](http://an insistent and peremptory request, made as if by right. "a series of demands for far-reaching reforms" synonyms:	request, call, command, order, dictate, ultimatum, stipulation "I gave in to her demands" verb 1. ask authoritatively or brusquely. "“Where is she?” he demanded" synonyms:	order, command, enjoin, urge; More) anything, nor using force against the mother.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.4.5. Con: The mother receives benefits from the fetus, [such as stem cells to repair heart disease](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21185-fetus-donates-stem-cells-to-heal-mothers-heart/). No one would argue that the mother is demanding such benefits without consent from the fetus and that the fetus has the right to kill her because her life might depend on it.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.4.5.1. Con: No one would argue this case because they are not the same comparatively. The fetus definitively has no chance at life without the mother. In your example, the mother's life is not wholly dependent upon potential benefit of the stem cells. The outcomes are drastically different.
1.2.5.4.1.7.25.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.5.
1.2.5.4.1.7.26. Pro: It is not anyone's place to decide when a woman should start a family or not. It is the sole responsibility of the woman to make that decision. Just like it is not anyone's place to decide when a man should start a family. It's not a democratic or public decision, it is a personal and private decision.
1.2.5.4.1.7.26.1. Con: In cases where a male partner wants an abortion and a woman doesn't, women decide when men will start a family all the time. Since adoption is an option, it isn't valid to equate a baby to 'creating a family'.
1.2.5.4.1.7.26.2. Con: Giving birth to a child doesn't necessarily equal starting a family.
1.2.5.4.1.7.26.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.2.5.4.1.7.26.3. Con: We are often given trials we are not ready for or want but we adjust and often when we look back we would not have it any other way.
1.2.5.4.1.7.26.4. Pro: The most significant portion of the time; emotional, physical, devotional and mental will be allocated by the woman, regardless of the intent of the man. Why is it feasible to deprive a woman of her voice to declare her readiness to change her whole life? Yes, certainly, obstacles crop up for everybody, no matter your privilege or position but within the possibility of the field of choice, why should this instance be forbidden to a woman. Choice is paramount.
1.2.5.4.1.7.27. Pro: Forced pregnancy, or denial of abortion rights, is an inherently sexist and discriminatory practice, since there is no other instance in a parent's life in which they are forced to  provide bodily resources \(i.e. blood, organs, bone marrow\) to serve their child. \([Cook, Dickens, and Bliss, p. 583](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1508897/pdf/amjph00004-0113.pdf)\)
1.2.5.4.1.7.27.1. Con: If an infant required blood and you denied the child access to your own, society has supported the creation of blood blanks to provide what the parent cannot. The age of your child should not dictate it's worthiness to access the most basic of medical needs via blood.   During pregnancy a mother's blood supply increases, so she is not sharing a pre-pregnancy supply of blood. She had created enough for two.
1.2.5.4.1.7.27.2. Con: Forced pregnancy is not the same as denial of abortion. It presupposes that intercourse was not consensual. For instance, there is no instance in which someone is forced to break a leg, and doing so is assault and ilegal, but if you decide to practice extreme sports then you implicitly comply to the risk of breaking your leg, not ilegal.
1.2.5.4.1.7.27.3. Con: This argument relies upon a false premise which compares every single other instance in which a parent may be requested to provide bodily resources and finds them to be equivalent. Refusing to donate blood to a child who needs it is not tantamount to causing the injury which lead to the exsanguination. The supposedly "forced" provision of resources and murder are not mutually exclusive in any other case.  Motherhood is scientifically, ethically, morally, and legally unique.
1.2.5.4.1.7.27.4. Con: No manner of pro-life thinking can be sexist because we can't treat pregnant men differently from pregnant women \(because they don't exist\).
1.2.5.4.1.7.27.5. Con: Abortion is not a "right" because it had to be invented, and is therefore not innate. There is no grounds on which to designate abortion as a right.
1.2.5.4.1.8. Pro: It is more, or at least equally unethical to raise a child without the proper resources or place them in the poorly managed foster care system, forcing them to live a life of hardship and suffering.
1.2.5.4.1.8.1. Pro: In an American court of law, someone who must endure suffering is weighted heavier than someone deceased. This is because we as humans understand that continued suffering is inhumane, whereas we assume that after death there is no feeling. Even in Christian thought, someone who is completely innocent of their concept of god still gets to go to heaven, therefore is no longer in pain. This is why we put animals to sleep when they are in pain.
1.2.5.4.1.8.1.1. Con: While some Christians believe that someone who never heard of God or who dies before a specific age goes to heaven, that is not a staple belief of Christianity. The Bible simply says those with faith are forgiven and resurrected, but those who do not have faith remain under condemnation. While the belief of individuals vary, there is no 'guarantee' in Christianity that aborted children all are resurrected to live in the new heavens and earth.
1.2.5.4.1.8.1.2. Con: That consideration in the law is made in comparison post-death with someone who has already died vs. someone still living, not as an ethical determination as to whether or not someone should be killed to escape future potential suffering.
1.2.5.4.1.8.1.3. Con: The unborn child is generally not in pain, nor wounded, nor dying slowly, so cannot be compared to putting an animal out of its misery.
1.2.5.4.1.8.2. Con: It is not more \(or even equally\) unethical to let someone suffer rather than killing them. If that were true, then we ought to kill all people in poverty or with disabilities.
1.2.5.4.1.8.3. Con: You should not assume a life of hardship is not worth living.
1.2.5.4.1.8.4. Con: A life of suffering often brings a life that is sensitive, creative, and aspiring. Just because a child may struggle because of a parent's decisions doesn't mean his life or lack of should be bound by them.

1.2.5.4.1.9. Pro: It is wrong to bring an unwanted child into the world. Even if the child is put into foster care, they may not find a family who wants them or may grow up feeling abandoned by their parents.
1.2.5.4.1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.
1.2.5.4.1.9.2. Con: There is no objective basis or any evidence provided for this claim. In the same way, one could say it is wrong to let an unwanted newborn live, or an unwanted elderly person live, or a person with a mental disability live. This claim places subjective value on human life that would apply to all human life if taken to its logical conclusion.
1.2.5.4.1.9.2.1. Con: Killing a person \(newborn, elderly person, disabled person\) harms them. If a fetus is not considered a person \(which is debated elsewhere\), then killing a fetus before it becomes sentient does not harm a person and is solely a matter of whether a potential person lives or does not live. There is thus a fundamental difference between debating whether a fetus should be born and debating whether a person should continue living.
1.2.5.4.1.10. Pro: A child's right to be wanted should take precedence over its right to live. A child should have a right to a certain quality of life, not merely a right to exist. Denying this to a child dehumanizes it, making it no longer a creature worthy of love and nurture but merely a creature worthy of existence.
1.2.5.4.1.10.1. Con: Using the word "should" presupposes an objective standard, yet allows for a subjective standard for "quality of life." Who determines what is a sufficient quality of life? Couldn't that be said for any human who doesn't meet a subjective standard for quality of life? The poor, the criminals, the elderly, all could fall into this category of having a less than sufficient quality of life. The only objective standard we have is the inherent value given to all humans based solely on their humanity.
1.2.5.4.1.10.2. Con: Even supposing that a child has a right to be wanted and even a right to a certain quality of life, such a right would not require a particular person \(its birth-mother\) be that person who wants it or provides that quality of life. Many childless couples, and those with children, are both able and willing to take such children and provide such things. Furthermore, if such rights did supercede the child's right to life and therefore justify abortion, they would also justify infanticide.
1.2.5.4.1.11. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.10.
1.2.5.4.1.12. Con: Societies in general do not allow a mother to [neglect an unwanted child once born](http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/child-neglect.html), nor do they generally allow her to [murder the child](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/27/mother-who-murdered-two-year-old-daughter-jailed-for-16-years). Most societies throughout time have considered these crimes. With ethical practice primarily against it, there cannot be claimed a fundamental moral principle that killing an unwanted child is moral, or that not allowing the mother to stop caring for her child, while the child is under her guardianship, is immoral.
1.2.5.4.1.12.1. Con: The alternative to caring for an unwanted child is disowning the child, not killing them or neglecting them. Ethical practice is not primarily against disowning a child.
1.2.5.4.1.13. Con: Abortion has the goal of ending the child's life. This would, not just could, harm the child in all cases. Even in the rare case of a child surviving, the child is harmed.
1.2.5.4.1.13.1. Con: The "child" would not be harmed by being terminated because it is not, and would never be, capable of having experiences and categorizing them as good or bad, which is a requirement for meaningfully designating something as harmful.
1.2.5.4.1.13.1.1. Con: There are many mentally ill people who are incapable of categorizing their experiences as good or bad, yet society would still judge their assault or murder to be harmful.
1.2.5.4.1.13.1.1.1. Con: Anyone who experiences pleasure, pain, or any emotion is categorizing their experience as good or bad. Anyone who has desires, goals, or fears is categorizing their potential future experiences as good or bad. There are few, if any, people who are incapable of all of those things.
1.2.5.4.1.13.1.2. Con: The [legal definition of harm](http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=964) does not include verbiage about someone's ability to categorize or evaluate experiences.
1.2.5.4.1.13.1.2.1. Con: The legal definition of harm was written for legal purposes and is inadequate for philosophical purposes.
1.2.5.4.1.13.1.2.1.1. Pro: The legal definition of harm includes harm to corporations, which are legal persons. If you agree legal harm to corporations is not morally equivalent to harming a person, then you agree something being legal harm does not make it actual harm.
1.2.5.4.1.13.1.2.1.2. Pro: Since fetuses are generally not considered legal persons, there is no need for the law to define the philosophical nature of harm in order to include or exclude the possibility of harming fetuses. Thus, whether it is interpreted as including or excluding that possibility is incidental.
1.2.5.4.1.13.1.3. Con: The child would be capable of having experiences and categorizing them if left alone to birth naturally. Interfering in that natural process to keep the child from ever experiencing the outside world would be a harm in the form of robbing the child of natural development which would otherwise lead to new experiences.
1.2.5.4.1.13.1.3.1. Con: The fetus is indifferent to whether or not it becomes a child which has new experiences, and thus is not harmed. It may be better to create another child who will experience the world than not to do so, and the fact that it will naturally happen if left alone may be relevant, but that is not the same as claiming that the fetus in particular is being harmed by not becoming a child with experiences.
1.2.5.4.1.13.1.3.1.1. Con: A fetus [as young as eight weeks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2900087/) reflexively pulls away from painful stimuli. This is why anasthesia is given to humans in the fetal stage. An indifferent response would be no reaction at all.
1.2.5.5. Con: The argument that the mother does not own the fetuses life really comes down to what we are using as a definition of life. While in the womb, the fetus is a parasitic being, it cannot live on its own. Once the fetus is born the parasitic bond is broken and life begins. So during pregnancy Mom had the rights, if fetus is born it too has earned rights. The definition of life is also going to vary from one religion to another and in the US you cant force your religion on other people.
1.2.6. Con: All women are equipped to bring a baby into the world, after all they have been doing it since the Stone Age. Today is just a matter of numbers, time, perhaps career, but this is no excuse. There are initiatives such as child care to help low-income mothers. Quality time is not in time itself, but in the level of involvement and there is no  profession that prevents someone from having children.
1.2.6.1. Con: While professions may not prevent women from having children, it can be more difficult for women to have successful careers in fields such as corporate law when significant time is taken out of work in order to have and raise children.
1.2.6.1.1. Con: Desire for a successful career does not redeem anyone of the responsibility they have to the child they conceived.
1.2.6.2. Con: Initiatives to help low-income mothers are not necessarily enough. It may still well be necessary for the mother to attempt to work multiple jobs and raise her family, which can cause a great deal of stress.
1.2.6.3. Con: There are numerous countries around the world that do not have sufficient social [security](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=36773#.Wjt9xCMwj-Y) and childcare services. Unwanted children in these countries can easily push families below the poverty line.
1.2.6.3.1. Con: Most of the countries mentioned in UN's report without efficient social security programs are agriculturally based; this is an environment in which large families are welcome. In fact, the farm lifestyle is very different, as boys and girls help the family in the daily tasks so a greater family means greater income.
1.2.6.3.1.1. Con: This is a generalisation - not everyone in these countries works in agriculture, and we should not be the ones deciding what is best for these people. It should be up to individuals and individual families to make decisions about reproduction and family size.
1.2.6.3.2. Con: A child does not reduce family income - parameter that defines the threshold- only increases expenses, but the family remains in the same stratum. The calculation uses the simple [equation](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PGLP/Resources/povertymanual_ch4.pdf)"Gi = \(Z-Yi\) .I \(Yi \<Z\)" where Gi is the poverty gap, Z represents the poverty line and Yi is the real income for poor individuals. The gap is zero for everyone else. Children are not considered in the calculation.
1.2.6.3.2.1. Con: Even if children are not considered in the technical calculation of what it means to be below the poverty line, it does not change the fact that having a child increases costs for a family and in some cases will also require a parent to stop working, such that overall the family will be poorer.
1.2.6.4. Pro: With the proper will and sacrifices, it is possible to have a career and raise children.
1.2.6.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.3.1.
1.2.6.6. Con: There are not enough initiatives for low income parents to have access to quality childcare. There is not universal access to quality affordable childcare.
1.2.6.7. Con: Statements like this make it seem like a woman's only purpose is childbearing, and her only 'natural' state is a mother, not a person. Women are not brood mares, and economic position, health and other variables do have a say in an important decision like pregnancy.
1.2.7. Pro: Bringing a child to life has consequences not only restricted to the moment of birth but for the rest of the mother's life and for all the people around them.
1.2.7.1. Con: Unless those consequences are extremely severe they cannot plausibly serve as ample justification for killing the child.
1.2.7.1.1. Con: A woman should, at the very beginning, have the right to evaluate whether she wants to or is able to deal with the long term consequences of raising a child. If she decides to keep the fetus it means that she has accepted responsibility, at least to a certain extent. Killing the resulting child therefore would not be the same as getting an early stage abortion.
1.2.7.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.9.
1.2.7.2. Con: A 4 year old child also can have a negative impact on a mothers life, but this doesn't mean that is a legitimate reason to kill the child.
1.2.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.7.1.1.
1.2.7.2.2. Con: It can not be said that ending the life of a 4 year old, is equivalent to ending the life of an unborn child. The 4 year old child and the unborn child have very different sets of capacities \(self awareness, ability and conceptualize pain, ability to form social ties etc.\).
1.2.7.3. Pro: Pregnancy and motherhood have a substantial impact on a woman’s career.
1.2.7.3.1. Pro: Motherhood has a greater impact on a woman’s career prospects than her level of education, according to a [study](https://www.youngwomenstrust.org/assets/0000/5376/Young__Female_and_Forgotten_Short_Report.pdf) by the Young Women’s Trust. Women with a dependent child are six times more likely to be economically inactive than those without children. In contrast, having children does not impact on whether or not men are in work.
1.2.7.3.2. Pro: Once women return to work after giving birth, many women face a "[motherhood wage penalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherhood_penalty),” especially at the bottom of the income spectrum. This means that working mothers encounter systematic disadvantages in pay, perceived competence, and benefits relative to childless women \([pg.14](http://content.thirdway.org/publications/853/NEXT_-_Fatherhood_Motherhood.pdf)\).
1.2.7.3.2.1. Pro: Many women spend time at home caring for children, and thus interrupt their job experience, or at least full-time job experience, which can lead to lower wages. Both childbearing and child-rearing detract from the time that could be spent developing job skills, furthering education, or gaining experience in the workforce. \([Human capital theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherhood_penalty#Human_capital_theory)\)
1.2.7.3.2.2. Pro: Mothers may trade higher wages for “mother-friendly” jobs that are easier to combine with parenting.
1.2.7.3.2.2.1. Con: This is not always possible. Single women, or couples in which the woman is the breadwinner, tend rely on this higher income, especially if it is needed to support a family.
1.2.7.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: In [2014](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/11279824/Female-breadwinners-why-earning-more-can-poison-a-marriage.html) thirty-one per cent of British women were found to be the main financial provider in their family – a rise of 80 per cent in the past 15 years, with an increase across all age and income groups.
1.2.7.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: According to a 2013 [study](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/its-never-too-late/201705/can-being-female-breadwinner-cost-you-your-relationship), 40 percent of American households with children have a woman as the higher earner, and 60 percent of African-American families have a female breadwinner. Female breadwinners include single mothers and married women who earn more than their partners or husbands.
1.2.7.3.2.3. Pro: Mothers may earn less because the needs of their children leave them exhausted or distracted at work, rendering them less productive. Mothers may also be less productive at work because they are saving their energy for their “second shift” at home. \([Work-effort theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherhood_penalty#Work-effort_theory)\)
1.2.7.3.3. Con: In no scenario should career aspirations dignify the murder of a child.
1.2.7.3.4. Con: In most Western countries there are legal measures that allow women to retain their employment status and forbid discrimination based on having children.
1.2.7.4. Pro: With the arrival of an infant, many households experience a significant [decline](http://equitablegrowth.org/working-papers/income-volatility-around-birth/) in economic well-being in the time around a birth. They face increased demands on resources, changes in the composition of income, and a potentially heightened risk of economic insecurity.
1.2.7.4.1. Pro: The drop in parents’ [income](http://equitablegrowth.org/working-papers/income-volatility-around-birth/) around childbirth can have major consequences for children as well. Inadequate family income is harmful for children—particularly young children—affecting their long-term social-emotional, cognitive, and academic outcomes \([pg.15](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/32706/412899-The-Negative-Effects-of-Instability-on-Child-Development-A-Research-Synthesis.PDF)\).
1.2.7.4.1.1. Con: Discouraging people of low socio-economic status from having children because poverty impairs their performance in society is basically eugenics.
1.2.7.4.1.1.1. Con: Genetics do not determine socio-economic status.
1.2.7.4.2. Con: Pregnancy and the growth in household size may trigger an increase in public program eligibility and benefit levels among economically disadvantaged households.
1.2.7.4.2.1. Pro: The Special Supplemental Nutritional Program for Women, Infants and Children \([WIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIC)\) is a federal assistance program that provides near-cash nutritional assistance targeted at this time period. It targets low-income pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and children under the age of five.
1.2.7.4.2.2. Pro: Many major cash and near-cash safety net programs in USA including the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \([TANF](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/programs/tanf)\) program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \([SNAP](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap)\), the Earned Income Tax Credit \([EITC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit)\) and the Child Tax Credit \([CTC](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/policy-basics-the-child-tax-credit)\), either restrict eligibility to households with children, or increase benefit levels when a new child is added to the assistance unit.
1.2.7.4.2.3. Con: Even in most of the developed countries, the social assistance that new mothers are entitled to is rarely sufficient on its own, especially if the mother was forced to give up her job to care for the child.
1.2.7.4.2.3.1. Pro: The amount an average single parent with two children receives in the [US](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37159686) is set by each state, with a 60 month lifetime limit. In Mississippi, they would receive $153 a month. In Alaska, the average benefit was $642 a month.
1.2.7.4.2.3.2. Pro: A single person with one child in Ontario, [Canada](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37159686) would receive a benefit of just less than $1,000 Canadian dollars a month, with no lifetime limit.
1.2.7.4.2.3.3. Pro: In [France](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37159686) a single parent with two children would be eligible for as much as €1,068.61 each month, but that benefit would be lessened by any actual income or other cash benefits the person was claiming.
1.2.7.4.2.3.4. Pro: In the [UK](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37159686), a single parent with two children could expect £292 a month. The person must have no income or low income, work less than 16 hours a week, and have savings of under £16,000.
1.2.7.5. Con: Aborting a child has consequences not only restricted to the moment of birth but for the rest of the mother's life and for all the people around them. Consider the risk of infertility, psychological damage, and social backlash.
1.2.7.5.1. Pro: Abortion has [harmful](http://www.thelifeinstitute.net/current-projects/safer-without-abortion/abortion-harms-women/) mental and physical consequences for the woman involved.
1.2.7.5.1.1. Pro: Those who choose abortions are often minors or young women with insufficient life experience to understand fully what they are doing.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1. Con: Those who have children at such young ages seriously impact their [ability to earn](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-delaying-parenthood-and-having-kids-later-is-a-big-deal-2015-6) and have a reasonable quality of life afterwards, and often lack the resources and support to raise them.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.1. Con: While this might hold some weight in third world countries, it is a hard argument to make in countries like the U.S. where the majority are in the top 5% of the world wealth-wise, regardless of how many children they have, and even those at poverty level is usually in the top fifth of the world. Not having many extra things or having to work hard is not the same thing as not having a reasonable quality of life.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This statement is no longer true, The States have been downgraded to a [developing country.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-developing-nation-regressing-economy-poverty-donald-trump-mit-economist-peter-temin-a7694726.html)
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: That is one economist's opinion about trends he sees, not an actual credit status or official economic evaluation. His opinion is based on things like the lower class having little perceived impact on social policy and perceived 'racist' undertones, not the actual wealth level of the typical U.S. citizen.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: This webpage has a widget that will estimate your wealth as compared to the world: [poverty.ucdavis.edu](https://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/what-current-poverty-rate-united-states)

1 person, no kids, making $25,000: richest 5.4%
2 children making poverty level $22,000: richest 19% 
Family of 6 with 4 children making $35,000: in the richest 17%
1 parent, 6 kids, making current median $59,000: richest 12%
2 parent, 1 kid, making $53,000: richest 5.7%
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.2. Con: There are many support groups and charities available to help new or struggling parents that lack information or resources.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Those support groups are often religious in nature, or are government supported, which either puts a strain on our already reduced fiscal resources allocated for those services or forces a religious doctrine.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The religious beliefs of an organization are irrelevant to whether or not it is available to offer aid except in the very rare case that a group is closed to non-members. A woman not wanting to take advantage of resources due to dislike of a particular religion doesn't mean the resources are not there.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: It is illegal in the U.S. for any group to force a religious conversion on someone. Exposure to a religious doctrine is not the same thing as forcing a religion on someone.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.2.1.3. Con: Government support of a group that aids new mothers is not more of a financial strain than any other safety-net program that society votes for.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.2.1.4. Con: That religious groups are often charitable in helping post-birth is a good thing, as it increases the number of support groups available. If support groups were restricted to only secular or atheist groups, there would be far less resources available for struggling mothers.
1.2.7.5.1.1.2. Con: The vast majority of abortions are women who do not fit in the minor or young woman categories.[Only about 17 percent are teens.](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/22689931/ns/health-womens_health/t/whos-getting-abortions-not-who-youd-think/#.WiDwvLaZOu4) About 60 percent have given birth to least one child prior to getting an abortion.
1.2.7.5.1.1.2.1. Con: 17% is still a significant percentage, as it is [almost 1/5 of all abortions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852976/table/T1/) in the U.S.
1.2.7.5.1.1.3. Con: Teenage pregnancy [increases the risk](http://www.momjunction.com/articles/effects-of-teen-pregnancy-on-society_00384725/) of spending the entire life in poverty for both the teen parents and the baby.
1.2.7.5.1.1.3.1. Con: Adoption is a good solution to this problem, and then no one has to die.
1.2.7.5.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.5.
1.2.7.5.1.1.5. Con: The "insufficient life experience" argument could also be used to favor legalizing abortion, as minors would, given their life experience, be unable to raise a child properly.
1.2.7.5.1.1.5.1. Con: Yes, except that adoption exists, which is a viable and good alternative.
1.2.7.5.1.1.6. Pro: Teenagers getting pregnant at an early age cannot pursue their higher education due to extra responsibility.
1.2.7.5.1.1.6.1. Pro: Some teens even decide to [drop out of their high school](http://www.momjunction.com/articles/effects-of-teen-pregnancy-on-society_00384725/) and find a job to supplement themselves.
1.2.7.5.1.1.6.2. Pro: This might reduce their chances to make a career and get a high paying job.
1.2.7.5.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.5.1.1.3.
1.2.7.5.1.1.7. Pro: A teenage mother could face several social obligations like not getting respect from friends and family members and experience an emotional trauma for bad reputation.
1.2.7.5.1.2. Con: [PPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_depression) shows that both women who abort and women who keep the baby have a trauma, therefore it makes no sense to ban the option of having an abortion.
1.2.7.5.1.3. Con: Experiencing feelings of guilt or regret in the short-term after an abortion is not a mental health problem; in fact, such emotions are a normal part of making a life decision that many women find to be [difficult](http://time.com/3956781/women-abortion-regret-reproductive-health/).
1.2.7.5.1.3.1. Pro: There might also be 'mental and physical consequences' if a woman has a baby she does not want. It is up to the woman to decide which course of action will cause them the least harm and she should be provided adequate information in order to do so.
1.2.7.5.1.3.1.1. Pro: Postpartum depression [PPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_depression) is quite frequent \(15% of women giving birth\). PPD can in its serious form result in postpartum psychosis \(1/1000\). Psychosis is one of the leading reasons for murdering children in the first year. It makes no sense to make something illegal on the basis that there is some small risk to mental and physical well being as a side effect of a medical treatment.
1.2.7.5.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Legal status of abortion is not based only on medical risks concerning the act of abortion but also ethical dilemma and implications of it.
1.2.7.5.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.3.1.1.1.
1.2.7.5.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.7.5.1.3.1.
1.2.7.5.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.6.
1.2.7.5.1.6. Con: An important part of the mental consequences of abortion are related to the fact that right now it is taboo. Legalizing it puts the problem on the table and thus makes it easier for women to talk about it or deal with post-abortion.
1.2.7.5.1.6.1. Con: There is no evidence that the consequences of abortions are due to it being taboo. Moreover, many wrong things are taboo and have negative consequences. This does not mean they should be legalized.
1.2.7.5.1.6.1.1. Con: What it means is that negative consequences which are the result of people opposing it are not a good reason for something to remain opposed.
1.2.7.5.1.6.1.2. Con: Recent research suggests that two out of three pregnant persons who have abortions anticipate [stigma](https://abguide.uchicago.edu/page/understanding-abortion-stigma-and-shame) if others were to learn about it. In a large US survey, 58% of pregnant persons felt they needed to keep their abortion secret from friends and family and 17% believed their regular healthcare provider would treat them differently if they knew about the abortion.
1.2.7.5.1.6.2. Pro: The mental problems often arise because of the conflict with society itself. Women who chose an abortion are too often told that they do something wrong and immoral. It's only understandable and normal that someone who is forced to hear such things will develop mental issues. If society itself was more understanding towards this topic there would be less mental problems after choosing an abortion.
1.2.7.5.1.7. Con: There are mental and physical consequences to literally every action. This is not a valid reason to restrict individual freedom.
1.2.7.5.1.8. Con: Women seeking an abortion are generally able to get expert counselling and advice on the possible mental and physical consequences, which can help them make responsible [decisions](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/health/abortion-mental-health.html).
1.2.7.5.1.8.1. Pro: In the US, women seeking abortions are required to be counselled about possible emotional or psychological effects in 22 states, nine of which focus almost entirely on potential [negative effects](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/health/abortion-mental-health.html).
1.2.7.5.1.8.1.1. Con: There is no [medical evidence](http://time.com/4599806/abortion-doesnt-negatively-affect-womens-mental-health-study/) to justify laws requiring women seeking abortions to be warned about negative mental and emotional side effects.
1.2.7.5.1.9. Con: Medical help is available for women who experience mental or physical problems after having an abortion.
1.2.7.5.1.9.1. Con: Medical assistance will not necessarily be accessible and affordable for suffering women of low socio-economic status.
1.2.7.5.1.9.2. Con: Medical and psychiatric help is also available to women during their pregnancies who feel reluctant to birth a child due to prenatal depression or other issues surrounding it.
1.2.7.5.1.10. Pro: Studies have shown that abortion has adverse psychological impacts on women.
1.2.7.5.1.10.1. Pro: A [recent study](http://www.jpands.org/vol22no4/coleman.pdf), limited in scope to self-reporting by 987 women visiting CareNet pregnancy centers, found that only 13% of the women had visited a psychologist, psychiatrist, or counselor pre-abortion, but 67.5% sought care post-abortion.
1.2.7.5.1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.6.5.4.
1.2.7.5.1.10.3. Pro: A [survey study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3395931/) of 278 women in Tehran post-abortion found that one-third experienced negative psychological side-effects following an abortion. Of this third, 60.5%  reported depression, 48.7% reported developing an eating disorder, 43.7% reported decreased self-esteem, 39.5% reported having nightmares, 37.5% reported feelings of guilt, and a third expressed regret.
1.2.7.5.1.10.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.7.5.1.6.
1.2.7.5.1.10.3.2. Con: There are all sorts of issues with that study. It's a very small sample, only 278. Its purpose is "Detecting types and frequent psychological side effects of abortion among post abortion care seeking" so everyone involved will have something negative to say or they would not be seeking post abortion care. Its conclusion is anything but anti-abortion — "Women's Psychological consequences of abortion have considerably been neglected in a community which has sinful and illegal look to abortion".
1.2.7.5.1.10.3.3. Con: Another [survey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2580059/) on 192 non-pregnant woman shows the effects of unwanted pregnancy on women. 28% were willing to trade time from the end of their life, 16% of women were willing to accept an immediate risk of death and 60% of women were willing to pay some amount of money to avoid pregnancy.
1.2.7.5.1.11. Pro: Women can be face severe bodily harm as a result of abortion.
1.2.7.5.1.11.1. Pro: There can be immediate and long-term [medical consequences](http://www.aul.org/womens-health-defense-actlate-term-abortion-limit/) of abortion including haemorrhage, infections, organ damage and future pre-term births.
1.2.7.5.1.11.1.1. Con: Which is why it should be safe and easy to get an abortion quickly before a surgery is required. [Between 2-10 weeks the mother can have a non-surgical abortion.](https://adviceandaid.com/abortion/types-of-abortions/)
1.2.7.5.1.11.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.6.4.
1.2.7.5.1.11.1.3. Con: There are always potential consequences of medical treatments and operations. However, we allow people to opt into these even when they are not medically necessary, such as with plastic surgery.
1.2.7.5.1.11.1.3.1. Pro: The decision to undergo such a medical treatment or operation should be made by the individual woman, with full information provided by medical professionals.
1.2.7.5.1.11.1.4. Con: Legal abortions performed in the developed world are among the [safest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion#Safety) procedures in medicine.
1.2.7.5.1.11.1.4.1. Pro: A [2012 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22270271) in the US found that from 1998-2005 induced abortion had a maternal mortality rate of 0.6 deaths per 100,000 abortions, compared to a maternal mortality rate for pregnancy and childbirth of 8.8 deaths per 100,000 live births.
1.2.7.5.1.11.2. Pro: Women with an abortion history are at an increased risk for [sexual dysfunction](http://www.wecareexperts.org/sites/default/files/articles/Abortion%20and%20intimate%20relationships_0.pdf) and face problems related to sexual desire, frequency of sexual intercourse, orgasm ability, and sexual satisfaction.
1.2.7.5.1.11.2.1. Pro: 10-20% of women [experience](http://www.wecareexperts.org/sites/default/files/articles/Abortion%20and%20intimate%20relationships_0.pdf) abortion-related sexual problems in the early weeks and months after an abortion, while 5-20% of women report sexual difficulties a year later.
1.2.7.5.1.11.2.2. Pro: More than 30% of women in a Swiss longitudinal study reported a minimum of one sexual problem six months after an abortion \([pg.4](https://www.imfcanada.org/sites/default/files/Interconnected_May2014_1.pdf)\).
1.2.7.5.1.11.2.3. Con: This does not disqualify the choice of abortion. It should be up to the woman to decide, whether to take the risk or not.
1.2.7.5.1.11.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.7.5.1.7.
1.2.7.5.1.11.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.7.5.1.8.
1.2.7.5.1.11.2.6. Con: -> See 1.2.7.5.1.3.1.
1.2.7.5.1.11.2.7. Con: -> See 1.2.7.5.1.9.
1.2.7.5.1.11.2.8. Con: -> See 1.2.7.5.1.3.1.1.
1.2.7.5.1.11.3. Pro: As the fetus becomes more developed, there is a greater risk that an abortion will result in [health risks and complications](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/10015#.WhrwQEpl86w) for the mother.
1.2.7.5.1.11.3.1. Pro: The [complication rate](http://www.aul.org/womens-health-defense-actlate-term-abortion-limit/) for abortion increases from about 3-6% in the first trimester, to over 50% as abortions are performed in the later trimesters.
1.2.7.5.1.11.3.2. Con: The easier it is for women to have abortions, the earlier they will take place.
1.2.7.5.1.11.3.3. Con: The health risks associated with a late abortion, are still [less](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/10015#.WhrwQEpl86w) than then health risks associated with childbirth.
1.2.7.5.1.11.3.3.1. Con: The original [article](https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/abortion-guideline_web_1.pdf) only considers mental health of unintended pregnancies for this comparison.
Furthermore, this response completely ignores the foetus, central in the original argument.
1.2.7.5.1.11.4. Con: Doctor's can and should inform patients of the risks in any operation. The presence of these risks doesn't change the right of the patient to make an informed choice.
1.2.7.5.1.12. Pro: Women are [more likely to die](http://afterabortion.org/2012/multiple-abortions-increase-risk-of-maternal-death-new-study/) following an abortion.
1.2.7.5.1.13. Pro: There are dozens of [studies](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/abortion-and-mental-health-quantitative-synthesis-and-analysis-of-research-published-19952009/E8D556AAE1C1D2F0F8B060B28BEE6C3D) by [various groups](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/14767058.2015.1051022) finding that woman are not only much more prone to various mental illnesses post abortion, such as clinical depression, PTSD, and suicidal tendencies, but also various physical maladies such as chronic pain, unintentional sterility, and future pregnancy complications.
1.2.7.5.1.14. Con: It is dishonest to tell women who are considering an abortion, that they face medical risks. The overwhelming majority of abortions are perfectly [safe](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/a-moral-case-for-abortion/18826#.Whn73Upl86w).
1.2.7.5.1.14.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.6.4.
1.2.7.5.1.14.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.5.1.11.1.4.
1.2.7.5.1.15. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.3.1.1.2.
1.2.7.5.2. Con: Social backlash is not an issue in secular regions where abortion is legal and normalized.
1.2.7.5.2.1. Con: Just because a country is secular and abortion is legal it does not mean that abortion does not have a negative stigma attached to it in society, or that it cannot generate social backlash. Most of these countries have lobbyists and political parties that are strongly anti-abortion.
1.2.7.5.2.1.1. Pro: In the majority of EU countries abortions are legal, but in some states a wave of "retrogressive restrictions" are threatening women's health and well-being, according to a report by the [European Council](https://euobserver.com/health/140158).
1.2.7.5.2.1.2. Pro: In the [US](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/us/politics/trump-anti-abortion-marchers.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FAbortion) President Trump has expanded religious freedom protections for health care providers who object to performing abortion; created a new entity within the Department of Health and Human Services called the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division; and declared the 22nd January 'National Sanctity of Human Life Day.' In a speech addressed to thousands of anti-abortion protesters, he said "We are with you all the way."
1.2.7.5.2.1.3. Pro: There are a large number of anti-abortion organisations in the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_anti-abortion_organizations_in_the_United_States).
1.2.7.5.2.1.3.1. Pro: For example the [Army of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_God_\(United_States\)) is a Christian terrorist organisation that has engaged in the use of violence in the United States to fight against abortion.
1.2.7.5.2.1.3.2. Pro: In the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence) violence directed towards abortion providers has killed at least eleven people, including four doctors, two clinic employees, a security guard, a police officer, two people \(unclear of their connection\), and a clinic escort.
1.2.7.5.2.1.3.3. Pro: Since 1977 \(in the [US and Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence)\) there have been 17 attempted murders, 383 death threats, 153 incidents of assault or battery, 13 wounded, 100 butyric acid stink bomb attacks, 373 physical invasions, 41 bombings, 655 anthrax threats, and 3 kidnappings committed against abortion providers.
1.2.7.5.2.1.4. Pro: Anti-abortion organisations and movements are widespread across [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements).
1.2.7.5.2.1.4.1. Pro: In [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_for_Life_\(Paris\)), the anti-abortion movement organises a yearly protest called 'March for Life'.
1.2.7.5.2.1.4.2. Pro: In [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements), over one million demonstrators took part in a march in Madrid in October 2009 to protest plans by the government to legalise abortions and eliminate parental consent restrictions.
1.2.7.5.2.1.4.3. Pro: In 2010 in [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements) over one million people signed a petition opposing the government's liberal abortion policy.
1.2.7.5.3. Pro: Abortion can have a negative effect on living children.
1.2.7.5.3.1. Pro: Post-abortal women report that their ability to respond to the remaining or future child\(ren\) can be manifested in several ways: a feeling of emotional numbness which leads to a lack of bonding, acting out of hostility and anger which can result in child abuse, and considering future children as “replacement children” who become overindulged \([pg.11](http://www.deveber.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Chap15.pdf)\).
1.2.7.5.3.1.1. Pro: After abortion, “replacement” children may find themselves the object of obsessive [parenting styles](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/indexablecontent/uuid:204af9c9-18ec-450b-8680-7f19890eec5a) of post-abortal parents who focus inordinate time, affection, or material goods on them. Parents may attempt to replace the lost child with a “wanted” child soon after the abortion. This can be [detrimental](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2791524/) to a child's development and behavior \([pg.13](http://www.deveber.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Chap15.pdf)\).
1.2.7.6. Pro: [6 out of 10](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/considering-abortion) people who get abortions already have children, and many feel they need to dedicate their time and resources to the children they already have, rather than having another.
1.2.7.6.1. Con: That seems to be remedied easily and ahead of potential pregnancy by tubal ligation and/or vasectomy rather than abortion.
1.2.7.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.4.3.
1.2.7.6.1.2. Con: Parents might not want another child for a time being and decide to attempt at pregnancy few years later.
1.2.7.6.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.4.4.3.4.
1.2.7.6.2. Pro: The birth of an unwanted child may have significant effects on existing children, including reductions in availability of care giving and increases in poverty. A [study](https://www.ansirh.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/2014-9foster-unwanted-pregnancy-effects.pdf) by University of California shows that existing children of women denied an abortion have 4 percentage point lower scores across all six domains of child development.
1.2.7.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.4.
1.2.7.6.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.7.5.3.
1.2.7.7. Pro: Parenthood has a negative impact on marriage and the relationship between spouses suffers once children come along.
1.2.7.7.1. Pro: Parenthood hastens [marital decline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2367106/) - even among relatively satisfied couples who select themselves into this transition. The rate of the decline in relationship satisfaction is nearly twice as steep for couples who have children than for childless couples.
1.2.7.7.1.1. Pro: In the event that a pregnancy is unplanned, the parents experience even [greater](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702669/) negative impacts on their relationship, including increase in relationship conflict and a decrease in love.
1.2.7.7.2. Con: Abortion can also have a negative impact on marriage and relationship.
1.2.7.7.2.1. Pro: There is an increased risk for separation or divorce following an abortion \([pg.2](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b499/4a5f23c5c9da17418d51e341cec0ee8d3eb1.pdf)\).
1.2.7.7.2.1.1. Pro: A [study](http://www.lifeissues.net/writers/air/air_vol20no1_20071.html) by Rue and colleagues reported that out of 331 Russian and 217 American women, 6.8% of Russian women and 26.7% of American women indicated relationship problems caused by an abortion experience. 7.8% of Russian women and 19.8% of American women indicated that their relationships had ended as a direct consequence of the abortion.
1.2.7.7.2.2. Pro: Associations between abortion and relationship conflict are logical since [anger](http://americanpregnancy.org/unplanned-pregnancy/abortion-emotional-effects/) is a common post-abortion emotional [response](https://ramahsvoice.com/5-types-anger-abortion/).
1.2.8. Con: If as a society we put others first, people would be there to help with what is needed to raise the child. In this type of society, the mother wouldn't have to consider ending another's life for convenience.
1.2.8.1. Con: But we do not live in a society where people are just willing to help raise other people's children. We live in a society that blames women for accidentally getting pregnant, and decries welfare systems that help these women.
1.2.8.1.1. Con: There are people, programs, and organizations willing to help. [SNAP](http://www.ny.gov/services/apply-snap) and [WIC](https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/women-infants-and-children-wic) are examples of government programs that help single mothers. There are many local charities all over the country that help single mothers. While some people may blame the women and decry welfare, many would want the best for the women. In some people's view an abortion wouldn't be the best for the woman. Embracing available help would lead to healthy relationships.
1.2.8.1.1.1. Con: The woman in question should be the one to decide what is best for her. If society sees her as able to handle the responsibility of raising a child, she should also be able to make other decisions concerning her own life.
1.2.8.2. Pro: In a society where women were able to fully raise these children or ensure that they end up in safe homes, caveating that everything was consensual, the only harm to the woman would be pregnancy. The minor pains and inconveniences of pregnancy should not outweigh a child's life.
1.2.8.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.5.
1.2.8.3. Con: Such an ideal environment does not exist in any commonplace way, and is so rare as to be completely useless to the average women making this decision.
1.2.8.3.1. Con: People willing to help others is common. We should strive to make this more known and more common for these issues.
1.2.8.3.1.1. Con: Insofar that this ideal is not an absolute then exceptions must exist, including exceptions when women must have the right to choose abortion.
1.2.8.3.2. Pro: Until this ideal society is considered the norm and resolves all women of the need to make this decision, it cannot be accepted as a reason to deny all women the right to abortion.
1.2.8.4. Con: Abortions are rarely done for convenience.
1.2.8.4.1. Con: Most of the reasons given have to do with[convenience](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html).
1.2.8.5. Con: If we accept that in a society where people put others first, women do not need to consider abortion and therefore women should not have the right to choose then we must also accept that in a society where people do not put others first, women do need to consider abortion and therefore they should have the right to choose. In contemporary society, women do consider abortion. Therefore, we do not live in a society where people put others first and women should have the right to choose.
1.2.8.5.1. Con: The proposition to demand abortion as a right is ensuring to produce a society that does not put others first.
1.2.8.6. Con: This argument merely refers to a subset of all abortions \(those conducted for reasons of convenience\). Regardless of whether you accept the premise, it does not provide a reason to oppose the right to abortion under other circumstances. To oppose women’s rights to abortion under some circumstances but not others suggests that in those other circumstances they should still have the right to choose.
1.2.9. Pro: A woman might feel that her home does not provide a safe environment for a child.
1.2.9.1. Pro: Women in physically violent and abusive relationships are likely to stay [tethered](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1363/47e2315/pdf) to abusive partners when they are unable to terminate unwanted pregnancies. This puts both the women and their children at increased risk of violence and other negative health consequences.
1.2.9.1.1. Pro: Intimate partner violence is [common](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-014-0144-z) among women having abortions, with between 6% and 22% reporting recent violence from an intimate partner. Concern about violence is a reason some pregnant women decide to terminate their pregnancies as they do not wish to expose children to violence.
1.2.9.1.2. Con: Governments have processes to remove children from these types of situations. In the United States, they have Child Protective Services. This service alongside adoption, imprisonment, and help from family members saves countless children from harm.
1.2.9.1.2.1. Con: The original claim dealt with women worried about raising children in their own home environments. Child protective services takes children away from parents, which does not help the women seeking a safe environment and the intervention of the Child Protection Service may make that environment even worse.
1.2.9.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.2.9.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.1.
1.2.9.2. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.2.9.3. Con: Optimal conditions for child-rearing are relatively rare. Children raised in unsafe environments can survive and thrive despite risk factors.
1.2.9.3.1. Con: This is an overly optimistic view. Childhood neglection, violence and trauma can amount to an ordeal that is all but destroying a child from within.
1.2.9.4. Con: Aborting the child does not make her home safer for the mother nor for any other child. Aborting a baby, thus taking its life away to protect them from getting harmed is the pinnacle of intellectual bankruptcy.
1.2.9.5. Con: Much like we wouldn't consider killing the woman for being in an unsafe environment, we shouldn't consider killing the child. The solution is to get the woman and/or child out of the unsafe environment.
1.2.10. Con: There are cases where a woman feels like she is not equipped when in fact she is. In these cases she only needs more self confidence, not an abortion.
1.2.10.1. Con: -> See 1.2.8.1.1.1.
1.2.10.2. Con: In the cases where the mother feels like she is not equipped, she would be better served by help and guidance, rather than being forced to go through it. There are well-known mothers in the news who were found to not be mentally equipped for the job at all. [Andrea Yates](http://time.com/4375398/andrea-yates-15-years-drown-children/), [Tamara Butler](https://caymannewsservice.com/2016/03/god-told-mother-to-kill-her-child/), and [Christina Treadway](http://people.com/crime/carolina-panthers-mom-killed-children-jumped-bridge/), for example. Pro-birth pundits should focus on care for mothers which would help both the born and unborn.
1.2.10.2.1. Con: The remote possibility that an extremly mentally derranged woman could end up doing terrible things is not a reason for a relatively healthy woman to have an abortion.
1.2.10.2.2. Con: These examples while horrific, are outliers, not representative of the general population. The vast majority of women are perfectly capable of raising children. Many do not see their own strength.
1.2.10.3. Pro: Prenatal depression is a factor that might push a pregnant woman towards abortion. Were it to be treated she might decide otherwise.
1.2.10.3.1. Con: Yes, it may impact some mothers. Quickly treatable prenatal depression not associated with unfortunate life circumstances that would significantly impact the mother's ability the raise child is a small subset of the population. It doesn't change the fact that everyone, everyone else as well as those experiencing prenatal depression, should have the right to choose.
1.2.10.3.2. Pro: Some women would only need to see their own strength. They might end up seeing children as giving purpose and meaning to their life.
1.2.10.4. Con: It is not the place of society or legislators to assert whether or not a woman needs confidence or an abortion. Passing laws based upon the assertion of what someone ought to do is a slippery slope that could lead to other assertions about what people ought to do. It is not the place of the government to prescribe certain beliefs and decisions upon people's life choices.
1.2.10.5. Con: Women often have a multitude of sources to help them with this decision including friends, family, the father, a doctor, counselors and so on.
1.2.11. Pro: The pragmatist will concede that we do not live in a perfect world and we are, more often than not, forced to live in grueling self-reliance. Many women who are disadvantaged cannot, under any circumstances, give the proper care required for a healthy child, emotionally and physically, to develop. When this occurs there is a net negative imposed on the society and the individuals impacted by the restricted access. It is unhealthy for the people and communities to restrict freedom.
1.2.11.1. Con: The impact on our society is exceedingly more negative if we allow our moral values to be overruled by net impacts. Although it is not good for a child to grow up disadvantaged, it is much worse for them to have their potential predetermined and be consequentally cheated out of life altogether. The final point conflates the restriction of freedom with limited opportunities and assumes that every child that grows up with socioeconomic barriers is incapable of overcoming them.
1.2.11.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.5.
1.2.11.2. Con: This claim misses the main point of contention about abortion: the restriction of the child's freedom.
1.2.12. Con: Lack of preparedness of a mother does not justify abortion.
1.2.12.1. Pro: Being ill equipped to raise a child is no justification for killing a child. If the fetus can survive detached from the mother then the mother has no unilateral right to kill it for any reason, least of all due to a lack of preparation.
1.2.12.2. Pro: The fact that someone is a burden to you does not make it moral to kill them. Institutionalised patients are a tremendous burden to the taxpayer, yet it would be immoral if the government killed them in order to balance the budget. Corresponding it should be immoral for a woman to abort her baby because her circumstances dictate it inconvenient.
1.2.12.2.1. Con: This argument is based on the flawed assumption that fetuses have a moral status that is equivalent to adult human beings.
1.2.12.3. Pro: Abortion is part of society's control addiction which is unhealthy. When we imagine that we can be in total control of our lives we are constantly disappointed and stressed. The striving to control all aspects of nature to the point of destroying an unplanned pregnancy is one aspect of an unhealthy and unethical approach to life. Being open to the unexpected and unplanned is more sane.
1.2.12.3.1. Con: It is unclear what is meant by "society's control addiction," and whether or not this is verifiable, or whether it applies to all individuals in a society equally. It is also unclear why preferring as much control as possible would negate someone's claim to control over their pregnancy.
1.2.12.3.2. Con: This argument asserts that controlling an unplanned pregnancy is unethical without properly establishing that it is unethical.
1.2.12.3.3. Con: This argument seems to assume that all abortions will be done from a near-psychotic obsessive mind-state, and that the harmful effects from being in that mind-state are enough to outweigh the harmful effects of an unplanned pregnancy.
1.2.12.4. Pro: Mothers of infants are also often unprepared but we call it murder when such a mother kills her 1 year old. The same laws should apply to the fetus.
1.2.12.5. Pro: You should not be able to decide whether the fetus is a life or not based on whether you want the baby or not.
1.2.13. Con: -> See 1.2.4.5.1.
1.2.14. Pro: If she became pregnant from being raped, and was not mentally stable "to carry" or raise a child, then abortion may have to be a consideration.
1.2.14.1. Con: The mental state of a woman is not directly related to the development of a fetus in the womb. Her body could still be capable of carrying the fetus to full-term and birth.
1.2.14.1.1. Con: [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4777678/) in epigenetics suggests that [experiences of the mother](https://cordis.europa.eu/news/rcn/128740_en.html) during pregnancy \(violence, fear, depression\) indeed [influence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4844196/) the development and well-being of the child.
1.2.14.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.8.
1.2.15. Pro: Everyone is pro- life till the baby is out. With no effective support system in place for the child after birth without a willing parent, the choice for abortion should be available to the mother.
1.2.16. Pro: She is in the middle of a divorce. Maybe she is afraid she will be outcast by her loved ones. Money can be a big realistic problem too. These are cases that might lead to abortion, besides rape. Making people take full responsibility for things they cannot control is wrong. Many people such as the government, the man, or the prejudices of society in whole is part of the blame. But, banning abortion without proper welfare is shoving all the blame upon the woman.
1.2.16.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.
1.2.16.2. Con: Raising the child is not the only choice available. Public policies supporting the pregnancy and further adoption of the child could provide the necessary welfare to women without needing neither abortion nor raising the child.
1.2.17. Pro: Pregnancy and parenthood are very [expensive](https://www.parents.com/parenting/money/family-finances/the-price-of-parenthood-an-exclusive-family-finances-survey/) and time consuming. Many women who get abortions are already mothers, and they want to provide the best care they can to their existing children, financially, emotionally, and physically. This should be their choice.
1.2.17.1. Con: If the fetus is already a child, then it follows from your argument that one should be able to terminate one's offspring to better provide for the rest. This is immoral, and therefore, abortion for the reasons you presented is immoral.
1.2.17.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.6.2.
1.2.17.3. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.2.17.4. Con: Vasectomy or tubal ligation would be adequate and less harmful in this scenario.
1.2.17.4.1. Con: Some hospitals do not perform vasectomies or tubal ligations on religious grounds. \(e.g. Many Catholic hospitals in [Canada](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hospital-halts-abortion-birth-control-procedures-1.160978) and the [United States](http://www.times-standard.com/article/NJ/20170916/NEWS/170919863) have not performed these services in the recent past, see links.\) Therefore, this point only applies if these services are readily available and not themselves disallowed.
1.3. Con: When abortion is easily available, it incentivises irresponsible behaviour.
1.3.1. Pro: When access to abortion is easy and cheap, abortion is more likely to be viewed as a legitimate form of contraception or as a fallback option, rather than encouraging women to use preventative contraception such as condoms and the pill.
1.3.1.1. Con: Abortions often require a number of doctors visits and a medical procedure. They are therefore unlikely to be viewed as a legitimate contraceptive option when other contraception is more simple and accessible.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Birth control pills have continuous physical and mental [side effects](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/290196.php) that can burden women who choose to use them. Some women might consider abortion to be a better option than deal with the side effects on an almost daily basis.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The birth control pill has to be taken at the same time daily and pregnancy rates increase dramatically in women who miss a pill \(rates rise 30-80 times, according to the [ARHP](http://www.arhp.org/Publications-and-Resources/Patient-Resources/fact-sheets/Successful-Contraception)\).
1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Being pregnant has many [similar and often more severe](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/in-depth/symptoms-of-pregnancy/art-20043853) side effects, so for most women it is unlikely that repeatedly getting pregnant and having abortions would actually be a better experience.
1.3.1.1.1.3. Con: Unless there are numbers to support this, it is pure speculation.
1.3.1.2. Con: The state has the ultimate power over the availability of abortions and contraceptives. Therefore it is up to the state to promote contraception and family planning over abortions.
1.3.1.3. Pro: A 2016 [paper](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/public-health/abortion-birth-control-substitute) on Nepal’s legalisation of abortion provides evidence of true substitution between use of modern contraceptives and abortion. It showed that each new legal abortion provider in a woman’s district of residence was associated with a 2.6 percent decrease in the likelihood of using modern contraception.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: This substitution seems to require holding ease of access to contraceptives constant. Thus, if we as a society decide that using abortion as birth control is bad, we can keep that practice rare by increasing access to birth control at the same time that we increase access to abortion.
1.3.1.4. Con: You cannot deprive the vast majority of legitimate users of abortion just because some will use it as a form of contraception.
1.3.1.5. Pro: The costs paid for so-called "easy free" abortions are shifted onto taxpayers. This is bad because other taxpayers may be more sexually responsible and yet are being forced to cover the enormous costs of the sexually irresponsible.
1.3.1.5.1. Con: It is more expensive for taxpayers to cover the costs of services when a child is born to a mother who can't financially afford to raise a kid. If abortions aren't available to less-wealthy people, taxpayers pay more overall.[The net savings for the nation as a whole over a two-year period if abortions were publicly funded in every state would total at least $339.6 million.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3100324)
1.3.1.5.2. Con: "Easy free" is just one of the models at which abortions might operate. It can be solved by people paying most of the price in small amounts over time or doing community service hours or many other things. Banning abortion because of taxpayers is as far from the actual issue as it gets.
1.3.1.6. Con: The fall-back option is firstly the morning-after pill.  It is highly unlikely that "in the moment" anyone would consider that they will just get an abortion if they happen to get pregnant.
1.3.1.7. Con: There is nothing easy about an abortion. An easy option is access to affordable birth control.
1.3.1.8. Pro: In many countries without strong state support for family planning services, doctors might be more inclined towards the lucrative work of performing abortions over the prescription of birth control - as was the case in [Romania](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/21/world/romania-s-communist-legacy-abortion-culture.html) throughout the 1990s.
1.3.1.8.1. Con: The possibility of doctors being corrupt and state not having strong family planning services support are not variables that should come into play when deciding general legality of abortion. They circumvent the fundamental "right to abortion" issue by blaming external factors.
1.3.1.9. Con: Abortion is considered a serious enough procedure that people are unlikely to rely on it as a form of birth control.
1.3.1.9.1. Pro: The [impact](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/193/6/444) an abortion has on the temporary mental health of a women is evidence to show that it is not something taken lightly because the repercussions are quite intense. Hence, it is very unlikely that abortion access will increase irresponsible behaviour. Moreover, abortion will not protect you from an STD.
1.3.1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.3.1.9.3. Con: Countless statistics refute your claim. A majority of abortions are done out of convenience \(i.e. [inconvenient timing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/3243347/) or circumstances\). Additionally there are testimonials of people claiming they use abortion as a form of birth control. Regardless of how seriously doctors take abortion, people are often ignorant or choose to ignore the risks.
1.3.2. Con: It is unclear why access to abortion would necessarily lead to more promiscuity than access to contraception more generally does, as people now have far greater control over their reproductive capacities.
1.3.2.1. Pro: This claim ignores that a second party is required for sexual intercourse to take place. It assumes that the risk of child birth is a dis-incentive to engage in sexual intercourse. The claim is an over-generalization or over-simplification -- that the risk of child birth, not the risk of pregnancy, is dis-incentive enough that more women would engage in sexual intercourse if abortion were available for its mitigation. It ignores that contraception is a mitigation for pregnancy.
1.3.2.2. Pro: It will always be easier, cheaper and less traumatizing to use a condom than to undergo an abortion.
1.3.3. Con: Improved access to abortions does not prevent women from behaving responsibly. Societies which grant women abortion rights almost always stress the importance of behaving responsibly when having sex, for example, by strongly encouraging norms of wearing condoms to prevent STDs.
1.3.4. Con: A woman being impregnated is not invariably a consequence of "irresponsible" \(an arbitrarily-defined term\) behavior on her part, so it is not fair that all women be invariably banned from performing an abortion.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Women do not just have sex on their own - if pregnancy is at stake it means they are having sex with a man, which means it is both the woman and the man's responsibility to make sure no child is conceived during it.
1.3.5. Pro: The abortion pill can be taken at home. This could encourage women to think it is not a serious medical [procedure](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill).
1.3.5.1. Con: The use of the abortion pill; although convenient enough to be taken at home, requires some medical guidance, as using it incorrectly could lead to serious harms to the woman.
1.3.5.2. Con: Taking the [abortion pill](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782406000783?via%3Dihub) induces substantial bleeding, nausea, and pain so intense that it often requires narcotics to control. It seems unlikely that someone could go through this and not think it is a serious medical procedure.
1.3.5.3. Con: This seems at best a reason to ban the pill, not the procedure itself.
1.3.6. Pro: Some men already use the pill as an excuse not to wear a condom. When abortion becomes easier and cheaper, men are more likely to use this as a way of getting out of using condoms, and pressuring women into being okay with it.
1.3.6.1. Con: Using the manipulative behaviors of men as a justification to impose restrictive laws on women is unfair and disturbingly misogynistic.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: We would not implement a law that forces all women to carry pepper spray at all times because that would be restrictive to women and would not prevent men from committing acts of assault.
1.3.6.1.2. Pro: Also, women may be as equally sexually active as males. Suggesting that males are the only initiators of sexual contact without strong supporting statistics removes female agency from the argument.
1.3.6.1.3. Con: Justification here is not abusive behavior of men but rather irresponsible behavior of both parties leading to accidental pregnancies. Both men and women should be responsible for mitigating risk of pregnancy if they don't want to raise children.
1.3.6.1.3.1. Con: In the hypothetical scenario above, both men and women are being responsible for mitigating the risk of pregnancy - the woman is on a pill in that scenario.  Hardly an irresponsible behaviour, considering it is the most effective contraception method we know of \(excluding vasectomy and such\).
1.3.6.2. Con: If women are on the pill, then it isn't relevant whether abortion is an option due to the efficacy of said contraception.
1.3.6.2.1. Con: It still is relevant. No form of contraception is 100% effective. Abortion is very likely to be used as a fallback option exactly by women who are on the pill but got pregnant nonetheless.
1.3.6.3. Con: This point directs at a different problem: sexual abuse. Sex is supposed to feel good for both partners, it is up to both to decide if they prefer to use a condom. If a man is manipulating a women into not using a condom when she would prefer to, it is not a mutual decision, and he is obviously taking advantage of her.
1.3.6.4. Con: Having a complete disregard for the woman's ability to think for herself in this situation is a dangerous concept. A woman is capable of making responsible decisions and saying no. The two situations are unrelated.
1.3.6.4.1. Con: While women do think for themselves \(as all humans do\) they often make irresponsible decisions, especially if enabled or encouraged by other people \(as all humans do\).
1.3.6.4.1.1. Con: "What if" scenarios are not a basis for banning the right to abortion from every woman. There are many ways a woman can get pregnant, many of which are not the result of woman's irresponsible behaviour. Almost everything would have some reason to be banned if we went down this rabbit hole.
1.3.6.5. Con: It is male-centric thinking that women would succumb to pressure to have unprotected sex just because abortion is an easier or cheaper option.
1.3.6.6. Pro: It's plausible that in the heat of a romantic moment both consensual partners may be less concerned about protected sex if abortion is an easy enough option.
1.3.6.6.1. Con: It's not plausible to consider abortion to be an easy enough option. Medical operations rarely are as there are many associated risks and costs.
1.3.6.6.1.1. Pro: Abortions, even when done early, come with cramping and other unpleasant physical side effects.
1.3.6.6.2. Con: Couples who are caught up in the heat of a romantic moment and engage in unprotected sex seem far more likely to use "morning after" birth control than to wait for a potential pregnancy and then have an abortion.
1.3.6.7. Con: An irresponsible man and a woman that create a situation where he is able to "talk" her into having unprotected sex because an abortion is easy or cheap, is a perfect example of two people that don't need to be parents. If they are this careless they should not have to raise a child that neither are mature enough for.
1.3.6.7.1. Pro: Disfunctional relationships may lead to disfunctional families, which in turn may lead to disfunctional people. Abortion may be the better option, both for individuals involved \(and potentially involved, e.g. the child\) and for society.
1.3.6.8. Con: -> See 1.3.1.9.
1.3.7. Con: There is no evidence that abortion access makes women engage in more irresponsible behaviour.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Legalising of abortion did not occur to make it easier on the irresponsible. In [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Norway#Gradual_liberalization_and_a_core_feminist_cause), it started with really hard cases where a committee decided for the pregnant persons whether they could get an abortion. After 25 years there are now [less abortions](https://www.ssb.no/helse/artikler-og-publikasjoner/25-aar-med-selvbestemt-abort-i-norge) per 1000 women than at the start. This suggests legalisation does not increase behaviour that leads to more abortions.
1.3.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.4.2.1.1.
1.3.7.3. Pro: Comparing [OECD countries](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.ADO.TFRT) with and without legal abortion shows that legalisation of abortion does not lead to irresponsible behaviour, while allowing more self determination.
1.3.7.4. Pro: The argument relies on the weak idea that availability of a choice \(abortion\) may make other behaviours more likely - even though there is no evidence to support that claim. However, we know for a fact that if women are denied access to abortion, the consequence is an unwanted pregnancy, and an imposition of someone else's will on that of a woman in a very difficult or health-endangering position. A weak hypothetical risk should never outweigh a very serious real one.
1.3.7.5. Pro: If we consider this a valid argument, then we should also consider that healthcare makes people take bad food choices, and we should not provide treatment for type 2 diabetes \(because people got sick conciously\). There should not be medical aid to people who got injured for being driving a car drunk, etc. Answer is education on prevention.
1.3.7.6. Con: This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15457623/) argues that there is a link between access to abortion and increased sexual activity, which was also linked to an increase in STDs.
1.3.7.6.1. Con: The study argues that more access to abortion created an increase in STDs, which the authors used to measure an increase in risky sex. We should see if it links to more pregnancy not just STDs, as there are a lot of contraceptives, but only condoms can prevent STDs. Therefore if the woman is using pills, implant, etc. they are not protected from STDs.
1.3.7.6.2. Con: Abortion should not be conflated with birth control. Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy, so any claims about its use or consequences should not include claims about STDs and/or increased sexual activity.
1.3.7.6.3. Con: The study showed only an association, not direct causation. The data was used to support a previously made hypothesis, not to develop a hypothesis from observed behaviour. Relationships to other activities and behaviours may exist, but have not been tested. Cherry picking, or argument by selective observation, is a well known logical fallacy and the result of the study may need to be challenged.
1.3.7.6.4. Con: It is only natural that increased sexual activity correlates with an increase in STDs. That's like saying that increased production of automobiles correlates with an increase in traffic accidents. Whenever people do something more regularly, the activity more regularly leads to accidents. This is not a sensible reason to stop doing things.
1.3.7.6.5. Con: According to [data](https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/tables/1.htm#modalIdString_CDCTable_0) from the CDC there is indeed a rise of gonorrhoea cases in America starting 1970 but there is a drop of syphilis cases at the same point which contradicts that study.
1.3.7.6.6. Con: Sexual intercourse is a normal human function. It is not irresponsible behavior.
1.3.7.6.6.1. Con: A normal consequence of sexual intercourse is pregnancy. Having sex \(especially unprotected sex\) disregarding consequences of the act is the very definition of "irresponsible behavior".
1.3.7.6.6.2. Con: The original claim was not that sexual intercourse was in and of itself irresponsible. For example, protected sex is responsible, unprotected sex with the realisation that pregnancy is possible is also responsible. Unprotected sex expecting to abort the pregnancy as a form of birth control is irresponsible.
1.3.7.6.6.3. Con: Humanity has evolved to the point where practicing unsafe sex while unable to support a child is indeed irresponsible.
1.3.7.6.6.3.1. Pro: This is undeniably true when considering the access and expense of frontline contraceptives.
1.3.7.6.6.4. Con: There are plenty of laws on the books that curb/prohibit what otherwise would be considered to be "normal human behavior."
1.3.7.7. Pro: Women are already taking part in sexual relationships, which is not the issue. Abortion is not specifically for women who have had a 'one night stand' and need a quick solution, it is for women who for a variety of reasons \(sexual assault, no financial support, physical ailments\) cannot have a baby.
1.3.7.8. Pro: If this claim was true, it would also be true that having emergency rooms incentivises people to have more head injuries. Even if this fact would be proven by research, it would still be unreasonable to shut down all emergency rooms, just as it would be unreasonable to stop providing abortions in cases of unwanted pregnancy.
1.3.7.8.1. Con: The proposition, "If this claim was true, it would also be true \(...\)", stated above, would be very hard - or even impossible - to support. The behaviour or conditions that lead to abortion are very different from the ones that can lead to head injuries. From another perspective: Can we propose that having emergency rooms can lower the perceived impact of a possible head injury on one's life, thus leading to a lower estimation of the risk of a behaviour that may lead to a head injury?
1.3.7.8.1.1. Con: The behaviour and conditions that lead to abortion are not so different from the ones that lead to head injuries. Examples include: the inability to foresee the consequences of one's actions and being intoxicated. Since many unwanted pregnancies occur as accidents under conditions similar to head injuries, it is unethical and illogical to refuse sensible medical solutions to those problems and make these solutions illegal, while we find it normal to care for head injuries using tax money.
1.3.7.8.1.1.1. Pro: Both head injuries and pregnancies can be the result of assault.
1.3.8. Con: Moral values and habits \(along with irresponsible behaviour\) are taught and learned from home. Abortion is just a method.
1.3.8.1. Con: The set of rules and beliefs in the society have also a huge impact on the moral values and habits of an individual.
1.3.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.6.
1.3.10. Con: There will always be outliers in any system who will abuse it. However, it’s socially irresponsible to do away with an entire system because of those statistically few individuals. Just like a small percentage of drivers drove drunk or some people scam Welfare checks, some women will have abortions instead of using birth control. However, we can’t scrap those laws or programs because they aren’t used as intended 100% of the time.
1.3.11. Con: Irresponsible behavior that doesn't harm others should not be prohibited.
1.3.11.1. Con: The whole basis of the argument is whether or not the fetus counts as a "life."  Abortion is clearly a behavior that harms that life.
1.3.11.2. Con: While the rule in this claim is true, it is potentially inappropriately applied here. The child may be an 'other' that will be harmed by the irresponsible behavior in question.
1.3.12. Pro: If you have sex, you may get pregnant. No contraception is perfect, so it is the responsibility of the couple to plan for sex and use contraception if they need. Abortion is not a "bail-out" from a mistake and it cannot be treated that way. Abortion removes the consequences of irresponsible behavior, so it incentivizes people to do it more, ending more innocent lives.
1.3.12.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.3.
1.3.12.2. Con: Not all sex is between couples, planned, voluntary or any other assumption this claim makes. Banning abortion on these grounds fails to account for many other real-life situations that occur.
1.3.12.3. Con: Abortion is a serious medical treatment with potential risks to the patient. This alone disqualifies it from being incentive for irresponsible behaviour - it has a big psychological and physiological cost attached to it.
1.3.12.4. Con: This argument is only works if we accept sex that is inherently immoral and/or having an abortion is inherently immoral. If neither sex nor abortion is immoral, then there is no reason to punish the behavior of having sex and getting pregnant with restricted access to abortion, just like there is no reason to punish mistypes by removing the backspace key from a keyboard.
1.3.12.5. Con: Carrying a child is an important thing for a woman. Choosing abortion isn't an easy decision, and the women that find this decision easy are a minority. Generally when a woman is considering abortion, she thinks about why she can't rather than why she 'just doesn't want to'.
1.3.12.5.1. Pro: There should be laws requiring mandatory consultations to make this decision as informed and conscious as possible. This will go a long way towards eliminating "convenience abortions".
1.3.13. Con: Abortion does not incentivise sex. Physical pleasure incentivises sex. Abortion may mitigate the consequences.
1.3.13.1. Pro: Women should feel able to have as much sex as they like. Society shouldn't judge them for this, and label such behavior 'irresponsible'.
1.3.13.1.1. Pro: There is a sexist double standard, men who have lots of sex, receive praise from their peer group. However, women who have lots of sex, are labelled 'sluts' and shamed by society.
1.3.13.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.3.13.1.3. Con: What an individual personally feels "should be" and what nature made that "is" are different matters. Sexual behaviors that are more likely to lead to unwanted pregnancies, STDs or compulsive habits are, in fact, short-sighted, pleasure-seeking and irresponsible, and should not be encouraged or supported by society.
1.3.13.1.3.1. Pro: STD risk increases with multiple partners[long term or over short periods](https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/1999/09/sexual-partnership-patterns-behavioral-risk-factor-sexually-transmitted) of time.
1.3.13.1.3.2. Pro: [Early initiation of sexual activity increases the risk for STDs and unplanned pregnancies.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2674603/)
1.3.13.1.3.2.1. Con: The authors of this cited paper claim that teaching kids both better contraceptive use and to wait for sex at a younger age decreases the risk for STDs and unplanned pregnancies. Age is not the determinant for safe sex, education is.
1.3.13.1.3.3. Con: This point begins by drawing a contrast between what an individual believes "should be" and what "is", then ends by stating what "should not be" encouraged by society. Society is an artificial construct, so all opinions relating to it are subjective and outside what nature made that "is".
1.3.13.1.3.3.1. Con: Artificial constructs we call "society" have immense influence on human behavior and environment humans operate in. Exactly because it is artificial, actions of elements taking part in the construct are influencing all other parts of it. For example, legalization of abortion causes population decline, which causes decline in GDP, which causes decline in living standard and so on and so forth.
1.3.13.1.3.4. Con: This is the naturalistic fallacy. We, as humans living in a society, get to decide what decisions will make that society the best it can be.
1.3.13.1.4. Pro: Where wanton sexual intercourse and promiscuity is not penalised by laws, there is little reason to impose indirect moral penalties and other sanctions for perfectly legal conduct. If people are legally permitted to conduct themselves in such a fashion, invoking no legal penalty, then they should suffer no legal-moral judgment when they are left to deal with the consequences of their lawful comportment.
1.3.13.1.5. Con: The absence or presence of judgement has no logical or causal relationship to pregnancy or abortion — pregnancy is not the result of society's judgement. It is a possible result of sexual intercourse, and as such must be considered by both parties independent of other concerns.
1.3.14. Con: In sexual intercourse that could possibly result in a conception, a man and a woman are required. If abortion is illegal, this means that what was, for the man a 'fun one-night stand' turns into a nine month period of punishment for the woman. A man played a vital role in the contraception, and the woman shouldn't have to pay for a joint 'mistake'.
1.3.15. Pro: Legal abortion will lower the sense of responsibility. Being responsible for your own sexual actions and performing safe sex is essential and the lack thereof should not be sufficient argument for legal abortion. We are responsible for our own actions.
1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.
1.5. Pro: When abortion is banned, women who do not want a child are forced to [seek out illegal abortions](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21255186/ns/health-womens_health/t/abortion-rates-same-whether-legal-or-not/). These are unsafe, and risk the lives of the women that try them.
1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.5.2. Pro: The methods used by women when they are unable to legally have an abortion are very unsafe, these include; the use of a [sharp objec](https://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2013/07/13/anatomy-of-a-coat-hanger-abortion/)t to break the amniotic sac to induce an abortion, the use of [abortifacients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortifacient), and pumping [toxic mixtures](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7328830.stm) inside a women's body. These methods, can cause infection, internal injuries, toxic shock, and a range of other medical complications.
1.5.2.1. Pro: [25%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709326/) of the women who survive unsafe abortion suffer long-term health complications \(5 million out of 19,932,000\).
1.5.2.2. Pro: An estimated [100,000-240,000](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abortion-usa-texas-doityourself/up-against-strict-laws-texas-women-learn-do-it-yourself-abortions-idUSKCN0YF1BC) Texas women have self-induced abortions \(most commonly with [black market misoprostol/Cytotec](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/the-rise-of-the-diy-abortion-in-texas/373240/)\) since restrictive abortion laws that forced the closing of many Texas abortion clinics were passed in 2013.
1.5.2.3. Con: The solution is to educate women about the risks of unsafe do it yourself abortions so that its not attempted at all.
1.5.3. Pro: Laws are useless unless they can be properly enforced. Experience shows that prohibiting abortion doesn't diminish abortion cases. In fact, it can increase the numbers of abortions, given that the hesitation for women to confess their intent to commit an illegal activity makes it harder for people to show them better alternatives.
1.5.3.1. Pro: There is an association between unsafe abortion and restrictive abortion laws. Abortion-related [deaths](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709326/figure/F1/) are more frequent in countries with more restrictive abortion [laws](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709326/figure/F2/) than in countries with less restrictive laws.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: Consequences for one party are independently enough of a driving factor in decision making in scenarios involving multiple parties or potential parties.
1.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.4.2.1.1.
1.5.4. Con: No one is 'forcing' the woman to get an abortion. There is no armament or law compelling her to do so. In such a scenario, she would be choosing to break the law and terminate another life of her own accord and personal wishes, not because she was 'forced' to undertake the procedure.
1.5.4.1. Con: This [previously posted study](http://www.nber.org/papers/w18338) shows that less than 15% of women would keep the baby based on legality. That means 85% of women have already made the choice to terminate the pregnancy no matter what. Removing the safe and legal options leaves only illegal and often less safe alternatives.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: Those women who have decided to abort, regardless of law, then would be lawbreakers. There are punishments for lawbreakers, and we should not cave to their demands.
1.5.4.2. Pro: The woman can choose to not have an unsafe illegal abortion if abortion was illegal. She could instead choose to continue with the pregnancy. She does not have to choose an unsafe and dangerous abortion.
1.5.4.3. Pro: Breaking the law often results in negative consequences.
1.5.4.4. Con: When there is no other option to terminate a pregnancy safely, and there are circumstances that the child will endanger or harm her in some way, women are forced to seek out illegal abortions.
1.5.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.5.1.4.
1.5.4.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.5.1.2.
1.5.4.4.3. Con: This is like saying people are 'forced to seek out' illegal drugs when they are unavailable - it's an illogical claim. No one is forcing the woman to do anything.
1.5.4.4.3.1. Con: When someone needs/decides to leave a room and you lock a door it is not illogical to claim that you are forcing them to find another exit, even though you have not indeed forced them to leave.
1.5.4.4.4. Con: The woman still is able to get normal medical treatment, which more effectively targets the problem than abortion in the majority of such cases.
1.5.4.4.4.1. Pro: "Today it is possible for almost any patient to be brought through pregnancy alive, unless she suffers from a fatal illness such as cancer or leukemia, and, if so, abortion would be unlikely to prolong, much less save, life."
- Dr. Alan Guttmacher, 1967
1.5.4.4.4.1.1. Con: Science and medicine have developed significantly since 1967. Today, we have numerous methods to cure what then used to be terminal diseases. Not all of them aresafe for the embryo or fetus, and therefore in some cases the pregnancy should be terminated to prevent irreparable damage. Also, pregnancy is a significant energy cost to a woman's body. The chance of a non-pregnant woman surviving chemo or a complex surgery and then fully recovering is higher.
1.5.4.4.4.1.1.1. Con: Unless the woman needs immediate treatment within the first three months of pregnancy, there are many types of cancer treatment she can opt for that carry [minimal risk to the fetus.](https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/dating-sex-and-reproduction/cancer-during-pregnancy) Even risk from the mother's side effects is less than risks from inducing labor early.
1.5.4.4.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Chemotherapy, a common form of treatment for pregnant mothers, [does not carry a significant risk to the fetus.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9071349/Pregnant-women-can-be-treated-for-cancer-without-harming-baby.html)
1.5.4.4.4.1.1.2. Con: Pregnancy in and of itself [doesn't increase risk](https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/dating-sex-and-reproduction/cancer-during-pregnancy) or harm to the mother, except in cases where the mother needs immediate treatment.
1.5.5. Pro: Removing women's right to legal and safe abortion does not remove the necessity for it. Women, if they feel desperate enough, will seek [dangerous abortion methods](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/opinion/sunday/the-return-of-the-diy-abortion.html) anyway.
1.5.5.1. Pro: In Romania, [more than 9,000 women died](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/15/abortion-romanian-history) between 1965 and 1989 due to complications with illegal abortions. This was under Ceausescu's rule and at a time when access to abortion was extremely limited.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: Legalised abortion furthermore has a great impact on reducing [maternal mortality](https://www.gapminder.org/documentation/documentation/gapdoc010.pdf), as seen in Romania after the liberalization of abortion in 1989.
1.5.5.2. Pro: Clandestine abortions exploit this necessity by making these operations expensive and not taking into consideration the health of the woman.
1.5.6. Pro: If abortions will happen anyway, it is preferable to make them as safe as possible so at least the women survive the procedure.
1.5.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.1.
1.5.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.5.6.3. Con: Abortions will occur regardless of whether abortion is legal or not. However, when abortion is illegal, fewer abortions will take place, and less babies will die. This is preferable.
1.5.6.3.1. Con: There will be a reduction in the number of babies that will die, but there are other factors to consider. More mothers will die or be injured. More unwanted children will be born. This will strain families and social services. This could lead to more citizens in unstable situations \(unstable homes, orphanages, foster homes\) which is a negative for our society.
1.5.6.3.2. Con: Less babies will die partially because [less babies will be made](https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2016/03/new-clarity-us-abortion-debate-steep-drop-unintended-pregnancy-driving-recent-abortion). This suggests that preventing pregnancies helps reduce abortions more than banning abortions, without the increased deaths and lasting harm caused by unsafe abortions.
1.5.6.4. Con: If burglaries happen anyway, it is preferable to make them as safe as possible so at least the burglars do not get harmed in the process.
1.5.6.4.1. Con: If a burglar is injured during the burglary this has a high chance to stop the burglary from taking place. If a woman is injured during an unsafe abortion this has no chance of stopping the abortion. These two situations are not comparable.
1.5.6.5. Pro: Unsafe abortions \(those that take place in unsanitary conditions or are performed by unskilled individuals\) result in [47,000 deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion) per year.
1.5.7. Pro: [Nearly 70,000 women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709326/) die and [7 million develop dangerous complications](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs388/en/) every year because they aren't able to access a safe and legal abortion \(not even counting those who die from pregnancy complications or in childbirth\). There is nothing "pro-life" about supporting the criminalisation of abortion.
1.5.7.1. Con: [652,639 abortions were reported by the CDC in 2014](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm). The WHO estimates 40-50 million annual abortions. Each adult life would have to be worth over 7142 fetuses for your claim to be valid.
1.5.7.1.1. Con: Since adult life is objective and foetal life is subjective, it is perfectly reasonable to claim that an existing adult life is worth more than a potential future one.
1.5.7.2. Pro: Abortion is a moral issue for conservative Christians. Abortion is not a moral issue for most everyone else. It should never be the federal government's job to dictate morality. The government's first priority is to defend it's borders and the freedom of it's people. A Christian would never choose abortion, but it's not a Christian's place to impose morality upon others. All law abiding citizens expect, and even demand, freedom. Pro-choice is the most logical solution.
1.5.8. Con: Abortion could be banned while contraception and adoption is made more accessible. Claiming that forbidding abortion will cause an increase in one issue forgets that other factors might reduce that issue at the same time.
1.5.8.1. Con: Abortion would not disappear no matter how accessible birth control and adoption becomes. There will still be cases of raped, failed birth control, and pregnancies that carry dangers to the Women. As seen from[Sweden's abortion statistics](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/ab-sweden.html), despite the fact many parts of the country provide[heavily subsidised birth control for women up to their mid-twenties, and the country provide free condoms at clinics, and free abortions up to 25-26.](http://gynopedia.org/Sweden)
1.5.8.2. Con: Access to contraception will not help when many religious and cultural circles demand abstinence. Young women may have access to contraception but choose not to carry or use it because they are at a higher risk of being caught and punished for being sexually active.
1.5.9. Con: Assuming legal and illegal abortions are equally immoral, the burden on us remains to prevent them from happening. To this end we can prevent women's lives from being needlesly risked \(and support them through their crisis pregnancies and present alternatives to motherhood like adoption\) as well as fulfil our moral obligation to the baby. The objective should be to prevent illegal abortions and provide support structures for the mother.
1.5.10. Con: Many women will keep their baby if abortion is banned. This [study](http://www.nber.org/papers/w18338) found if abortion were prohibited in 31 states, the national US abortion rate would fall by 14.9%.
1.5.10.1. Con: That leaves over 550,000 women every year that will still get an abortion but in an illegal way, which is much less safe.
1.5.10.2. Pro: Making abortion illegal will free up funds for education for women on methods of birth control that also help prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, help with adoption, pre-natal care and family support, etc.
1.5.11. Pro: When abortion is banned, in practice this means that only women who can afford it can access safe abortion. Getting a safe abortion when it is illegal is more expensive and in low-income countries, a significant fraction of the population cannot afford it. [Who is at risk?](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs388/en/)
1.5.11.1. Con: This is a marxist-leninist fallacy. The objective shouldn't give poor women safe abortions like the rich ones do. The objective should be avoid having more children killed.
1.5.11.2. Pro: This increases economic inequality, because rich women who are able to travel can get abortions, while poor women who aren't able to travel can't. For example, in the US, [women who are denied abortions are three times more likely to be living below the poverty line two years later than women who are able to access them](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/magazine/study-women-denied-abortions.html).
1.5.12. Con: Committing murder is not without risk. When a person intentionally sets out to murder another, such an activity always has a level of risk involved for the murderer. The risks involved could be considered between a spectrum of physical death and spiritual purgatory.
1.5.13. Con: The argument that a law has some negative consequences only has merit if those negative consequences are substantial compared to the good effects of the law. In this case, the injuries from unsafe abortion are not substantially comparable to millions of innocent lives saved by banning the practice.
1.5.13.1. Pro: Abortion being illegal would likely lead to a reduction in the number of abortions, which would mean an overall reduced number of lives lost, when considering both the mother and the fetuses.
1.5.13.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.4.2.1.1.
1.5.13.1.2. Con: The overall number might be reduced, but this does not consider the quality of those lives. To begin a life does not assure its well-being; or well-doing.
1.5.13.2. Con: Banning the practice does not save any life. Women will seek abortions whether they are legal or not. The difference here is whether the practice is made by professional doctors or by clandestine doctors.
1.5.13.2.1. Con: Banning the practice of abortion will save unborn lives.
1.5.13.3. Pro: The suggestion is that we should not make laws because people who will still want to break them will break them in a more dangerous way. This logic not only could be used to eliminate all laws that stop immoral things, but is also overlooking the main issue of saving lives that will certainly be killed otherwise, the child.
1.5.13.4. Con: If the mother is in a bad environment, didn't consent with the pregnancy, or is ill prepared to go through the pregnancy, it would cause more harm to the mother and child \(for example bad parenting, crime, mental health issues or little to no opportunity to go beyond the poverty line, transmitted disease, serious birth defect\). The ban would save lives, but those lives can be very cruel.
1.5.13.4.1. Con: This is suggesting that death for the child is not the worst possible outcome. This is called euthanasia and is an unsubstantiated claim.
1.5.13.5. Con: [Nearly 60% of US women who get abortions already have at least one living child](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/characteristics-us-abortion-patients-2014). An increase in unsafe illegal abortions would lead to an increase in orphans and would increase the strain on partners, families, and the government to care for children whose mothers died or were hospitalized after botched abortions.
1.5.14. Con: A better alternative than abortion for reducing these risks is reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in the first place. Abortion is a poor substitute for contraception, sexual education, and abstinence.
1.5.14.1. Pro: This is why most pro-choice people support universal sexual health education and free contraceptives.
1.5.14.2. Con: The issue is that these resources are not properly allocated or presented to the populace. Women should not be made to suffer because of a failure of government.
1.5.14.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.8.
1.5.14.3. Con: Abortion is not a replacement for contraception or sexual education, it should be complementary: sexual education and contraception to minimize unwanted pregnancies and legal abortion to minimize risks inherent to an abortion.
1.5.14.4. Pro: Abortion is a band-aid solution to systemic issues in society. While it may need to remain legal, it does nothing to address the reasons behind unwanted pregnancy.
1.5.15. Con: Any act will still happen regardless of whether it is legal or illegal. This is not a sufficient reason to legalize an activity which is wrong.
1.5.15.1. Con: In a democracy, you need a reason to make something illegal, not a reason to make it legal.
1.5.15.1.1. Con: The United States is not a democracy. It is a republic, which is similar, but with key differences.
1.5.15.1.2. Con: There are legitimate reasons for banning abortion. Health and the right to life are some of these.
1.5.15.2. Pro: That a robber will rob a bank regardless of the law is not reason for a bank to pull security and order the guards not to fire lest it be 'unsafe' for the robber.
1.5.15.3. Con: Legality affords those under 'common law' to experience the ability to pursue their intentions with their own methods and ideals, and without the hinderence of others in ways that contradict their ability to pursure their dreams. The 'right to abortion' simply provides anyone a free unbiased environment to choose, it does not determine whether the action is moral. Therefore 'wrong' is not definitive enough to call a reaonable conclusion, and disregarding law is disregarding context.
1.5.15.4. Pro: That's like saying "We shouldn't regulate guns because people would buy guns illegally and from dangerous people anyway".
1.5.15.5. Pro: A great example of this can be seen in the ban on hard drugs. The government knows people will seek out illegal and potentially harmful drugs, but that is not a reason to lift the ban on them, making them easier to access.
1.5.15.5.1. Con: The war on drugs is an good example of why prohibition does not work. Criminalizing behavior may not deter that behavior as long as incentives exist and may only compound the problem without addressing the underlying cause.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.7. Con: Abortion might be used for genetic selection.
1.7.1. Con: The above assumes that genetic selection is a bad thing. This cannot be simply assumed without justification.
1.7.1.1. Pro: While there are forms of genetic selection that civilized society agrees is unethical \(genocide\), there is also genetic selection that is universally considered acceptable \(mate selection\). Therefore, genetic selection itself cannot be referenced as a categorically ethical nor categorically unethical practice.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Genetic selection is the cornerstone of Darwinian evolution, however it has traditionally been carried out by mate selection rather than selective birth. To suggest that there is an issue with genetic selection is to suggest that evolution itself is immoral.
1.7.1.3. Con: Genetic selection is by definition the application of stereotypes and would result in racism and sexism against unborn organisms. If the parents don't want short children they would kill the unwanted organism.
1.7.1.3.1. Con: Genetic selection is not the application of stereotypes by definition. Genetic selection can be used for other reasons.
1.7.2. Con: Using abortions for genetic selection can be prevented without outlawing abortion.
1.7.2.1. Pro: [Ohio](http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2017/12/gov_john_kasich_signs_down_syn.html) and other states have recently banned abortion after a diagnosis that the child has down syndrome.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: The law bans women from getting an abortion on the basis of that diagnosis - but it is extremely difficult to prove a causal connection between the two.
1.7.2.2. Con: Parents can easily lie about their reasons for wanting an abortion.
1.7.2.2.1. Con: The law could state that pregnant people cannot learn \(non-critical\) information about the fetus until they agree to carry the pregnancy to term except in case of medical complications, thus preventing them from aborting based on genetics.
1.7.2.2.1.1. Con: Preventing women from knowing about the disability status of their child is inconsistent with the critical pro choice argument that she has right to make an informed decision about her body.
1.7.3. Con: It is not unethical to use genetic testing, to prevent babies with severe disabilities from being born. Indeed, it would be cruel to allow individuals whose lives would be characterised by extreme suffering to be born.
1.7.3.1. Con: It is unethical to prevent babies with severe disabilities from being born. A severe disability does not necessarily mean the child will suffer. And yet we allow genetic testing for the purpose of preventing severely disabled children from being born.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: Women might decide to abort a fetus with a disability because they know that they do not have the capacity, time and financial resources to care for a child \(and later, an adult\) with such needs.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Children can be tested for the genetic disease [Tay-Sachs](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tay-sachs-disease/symptoms/) whilst they are in the womb. Children with the disease have a maximum life expectancy of 4 years. When the child is alive, they suffer terribly. The child looses their ability to see and hear, the child has difficulties swallowing, and eventually the child will become paralyzed. A women who considers aborting a child with this condition, is not acting immorally, they are preventing their child from suffering.
1.7.3.3. Pro: [Edwards syndrome](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/trisomy-18#) can be detected when a baby is in the womb.  The condition causes abnormalities and defects in multiple organs. The majority of children with this condition will die due to a miscarriage. Those that are born, suffer from several life-threatening medical problems. The small percentage of children with Edwards' syndrome who live for longer than one year, often suffer from severe intellectual disabilities. It is not unethical for a woman to abort a child with Edwards syndrome.
1.7.3.4. Con: It is unethical to determine on behalf of another human being that their life is not worth keeping as it may cause them undue suffering, because suffering is subjective. This decision could never be made objectively.
1.7.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.1.1.
1.7.3.6. Pro: Some birth defects are fatal or severely limiting to a child. A women deserves to choose the best life \(or kindest death\) for themselves and their child.
1.7.3.7. Pro: If people want to voluntarily commit genetic selection they should have a right to.
1.7.3.8. Con: Improvements to medical treatment could be found to [treat](https://nypost.com/2017/10/25/doctors-perform-incredible-surgery-on-baby-inside-womb/) and extend the life of babies with genetic birth defects. Due to medical improvements the average life expectancy of individuals with Down syndrome [is 60.](http://www.nads.org/resources/facts-about-down-syndrome/) [Killing people with genetic defect as a medical solution to genetic disorders](https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/08/down-syndrome-iceland-cbs-news-disturbing-report/) rather then pushing for new treatments or cures leads us back to the same fail vision of the eugenics movement in the 1900's and ultimately can lead to the [systemic genocide of a group of people.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/whats-the-real-down-syndrome-problem-the-genocide/2018/03/14/3c4f8ab8-26ee-11e8-b79d-f3d931db7f68_story.html?utm_term=.7ad36c9455f5)
1.7.3.9. Con: Although it is hard to find statistics on the subject, the fact that many people with disabilities live without attempting suicide would seem to imply that they think that their lives are worth living.
1.7.3.9.1. Pro: Most disabled individuals are glad that they were given the chance to be alive, and they are glad that they were not aborted. The able bodied shouldn't make decisions about whether or not a disabled person's life is worth living - without consulting the individual or the disabled community.
1.7.3.9.1.1. Pro: Many [disabled](https://successstory.com/inspiration/10-best-successful-personalities-with-disabilities) people have contributed to society and have lived successful lives.
1.7.3.9.1.1.1. Pro: [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking) is one of the most well-known physicists in the world, and was able to achieve that despite being diagnosed with ALS when he was 21.
1.7.3.9.1.1.2. Pro: [Stevie Wonder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder) is a musician, singer and songwriter who was born blind. He is considered to be one of the most critically and commercially successful musical performers of the late 20th century.
1.7.3.9.1.1.3. Pro: [Helen Keller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller) was an American author, political activist, lecturer and the first deaf and blind person to earn a college degree.
1.7.3.9.2. Con: This is only feasible in economically stable societies with resources to aid the severely disabled.
1.7.4. Con: This is irrelevant. The act of having sexual intercourse and any subsequent decision on whether to have an abortion \(or not\) could also be seen as genetic selection.
1.7.4.1. Pro: The function of mate selection is inherently genetic selection. Most western societies strongly uphold the ideal that one should be allowed to choose whom to have children with. Often married couples will use surrogates to ensure that their children don't inherit potentially devastating genetic diseases. This is not often frowned upon. Genetic selection is not inherently wrong, only the means by which it is accomplished are.
1.7.4.2. Pro: Ones decision with whom to have a baby also counts as genetic selection.
1.7.5. Pro: In many countries girls are more likely to be aborted, resulting in a disproportionate male-to-female ratio.
1.7.5.1. Pro: In China, sons are often seen as more desirable. This is particularly the case in rural areas, in which, sons are valued because of their ability to perform manual and agricultural work. The result of this, is that women are [disproportionately aborted](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11393782/China-and-gender-abortion-Government-policy-isnt-the-answer.html).
1.7.5.2. Pro: If there are less women than men in society, large numbers of men will find it harder to get married and have a family. This can result in men feeling [lonely, hopeless and suicidal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3367246/).
1.7.5.3. Pro: When women are more likely to be aborted, this normalizes a narrative that women's lives are less important.
1.7.5.4. Con: This argument is easily separated from the larger argument by making it illegal to determine the sex of the fetus in these countries as is the case in countries like [India](http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sex-determination-an-old-law-a-new-debate/) already.
1.7.5.4.1. Con: This approach undermines the freedom of couples to properly plan for their baby. There are legitimate medical and social reasons to find out the baby's sex ahead of time \(e.g. preparing older siblings, intersex children, pure curiosity\) that do not involve sex-based abortion. This unfairly limits all couple's options to prevent some couples from discriminatory abortions.
1.7.5.5. Con: This is actually beneficial to surviving women as a society with significantly fewer women than men gives the women more choices in dating, and consequently more power than they would have before.
1.7.5.6. Pro: In [India](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22530074-400-technology-driving-rise-in-abortions-of-girls-in-india/), approximately 10 million girls were aborted between 1991 and 2011, which has led to there being 914 girls to every 1000 boys by 2011.
1.7.5.6.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21612820) found that in Indian families where the firstborn was a girl, the second child was unnaturally likely to be a boy, whereas if the firstborn was a boy, sex ratios among subsequent children were normal. The study also found that second boys were not aborted, only second girls.
1.7.5.6.2. Pro: A [study](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2083801-records-reveal-gender-selective-abortion-taking-place-in-canada/) found that some Indian-born immigrants in Canada are electively aborting female fetuses if they have already had two daughters.
1.7.5.6.2.1. Con: The incidence of this is low, and the practice is likely to go away on its own as immigrants become [settled](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2083801-records-reveal-gender-selective-abortion-taking-place-in-canada/).
1.7.5.7. Con: This is not an issue relevant to abortion, rather a separate problem. Banning abortion altogether to stop discrimination would be like banning knives or guns to stop murders.
1.7.6. Pro: Disabled children, have just as much of a right to life as any other child. In a society in which women have the right to choose an abortion, the disabled will disproportionately be aborted.
1.7.6.1. Pro: If many disabled children are aborted, the disabled children which are born will have to live in a society with very few people like them.
1.7.6.1.1. Pro: Doctors and specialists will increasingly not learn about disabilities and how to approach subjects such as therapy, physical training, and educations because the market for these products will disappear. This is likely to be incredibly harmful to the disabled children which are born.
1.7.6.1.1.1. Con: Perhaps a "market" need not exist, and bespoke products could take their place.
1.7.6.1.2. Pro: Disabled people will increasingly lack a community of similar peers to support them.
1.7.6.1.2.1. Con: By the same logic, we should prevent those that suffer from any specific ill to get better \(or at least, we shouldn't help others to avoid the ill in the first place\), because that would deprive those that keep suffering from peers to be supported by.
1.7.6.1.3. Pro: People in society will be very unaccustomed to disability which is likely to increase bullying and make people act in ways which are more harmful to these children.
1.7.6.1.3.1. Con: [Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-a0039114.pdf) can help prevent bullying.
1.7.6.1.4. Pro: If there are less disabled individuals, then there are less people who can lobby for the rights of the disabled within society.
1.7.6.1.5. Con: Abortion is currently legal in many countries, and there are still a reasonably sizeable disabled community, such that this does not seem to be the case.
1.7.6.1.6. Con: If a technology is developed, that would allow curing \(preventing\) certain disabilities during gestation, this same argument would go against using it. However, all other factors being equal, curing is evidently always preferable.
1.7.6.2. Con: Aborting a disabled child is not inherently more immoral than aborting a healthy one.
1.7.6.2.1. Con: Aborting an unhealthy child is not more unjust than aborting a healthy child if the reason is the same. If the mother is aborting the child because they are disabled, however, that is discriminatory.
1.7.6.2.1.1. Pro: One has an intuition that if the Nazis had simply spun a wheel and killed 6 million random individuals, this would not have been as bad as killing 6 million individuals because they were Jews. Crimes are worse when they are committed with the intent to harm a person based solely on their identity.
1.7.6.2.1.2. Pro: Intent is the determining factor in a crime. This is why murder is a crime even though the act is the same as killing in self defense. Simply because two people abort does not mean that these two abortions are equally morally valid.
1.7.6.3. Con: This is wide open to reductio. We can replace “disabled children” with any other category of children more likely to be aborted \(say “the children of mothers who are open to the idea of abortion” or “children conceived through rape”\)  and construct an analogous argument.
1.7.6.3.1. Con: The legitimacy of the argument remains. Bottomline, we'll be choosing what type of lives are worth living and what are not.
1.7.6.4. Con: -> See 1.7.3.
1.7.6.5. Pro: Countries where women have the right to choose abortion, such as Norway, Denmark and [Iceland](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/new-report-iceland-aborts-100-of-babies-with-down-syndrome), are about to [eradicate Down syndrome](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/denmark-denies-practicing-eugenics-because-it-didnt-abort-4-babies-with-dow) through abortion, that is, [eugenics](https://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/2013/12/deselecting-our-children-2/#.WluXxa6nGHt).
1.7.6.5.1. Pro: People with Down Syndrome are capable of [living happy lives, and having a job](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/downs-syndrome-parents-think-again-1032193.html). Women should not abort babies with Down Syndrome because they think that their child's quality of life will be low.
1.7.6.5.1.1. Con: Caring for a child with Down's Syndrome is exhausting and lasts even after they reach adulthood. The brunt of the effort is borne by the mother. Therefore she should have the right to decide if she is up to the task.
1.7.6.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.7.3.1.1.
1.7.6.5.2. Con: Women should have the right to abort babies with down syndrome if they so choose: it is not enough to ban abortion because they might choose to have kids that will have a better quality of life.
1.7.6.6. Con: The cost of raising some disabled children can be [four times](https://mom.me/kids/13673-cost-raising-child-special-needs/) the amount of a normal child.
1.7.6.6.1. Con: Some dependent spouses may have much higher demands and be more costly to maintain than others. Assuming the unborn child is a life, and applying the logic and principles of your claim: A supporting spouse would be able to subjectively determine a financial threshold at which their dependent spouse becomes financially unviable. Once this threshold is reached, the supporting spouse can then take the dependent spouse to a designated medical clinic for termination.
1.7.6.7. Pro: By allowing women to choose to abort disabled babies, the state furthers the prejudiced idea that the lives of the disabled are not worth living.
1.7.6.7.1. Con: Some parents do not have the money to give disabled children a comfortable life, and adoption agencies do not take many of them because families looking to adopt prefer able bodied babies. No parent should subject a child to a short lived and deeply painful life just because of societal biases against disabled children.
1.7.6.8. Con: A child with a disability may be aborted, to spare them the life of that disability.
1.7.6.8.1. Con: The [social model](https://www.scope.org.uk/about-us/our-brand/social-model-of-disability) of disability, states that disability is primarily caused by societies prejudices. If society provides disabled individuals with the resources that they require, disabled individuals are just as capable of living fulfilling lives as anyone else in society. They do not need to be aborted, in order to spare them of their 'disability.'
1.7.6.8.2. Con: -> See 1.7.3.9.1.
1.7.6.9. Con: The problem with this is that it assumes all women have the resources necessary to raise disabled children. When they do not, those children live a short life full of suffering because they cannot get the services they desperately need.
1.7.6.9.1. Con: If women do not have the necessary resources, adoption is still an option. Adoption and the foster care system may not be great, but they are still preferable alternatives to death.
1.7.6.9.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.7.6.9.1.2. Con: Adoption is not necessarily a better option - disabled children are less likely to get adopted, which means many of them will be confined to foster care throughout their entire childhood.
1.7.6.9.1.3. Con: In most countries the foster care system is already overburdened, and they barely have the resources to provide for healthy children. It is unlikely that the system would be able to provide sufficient care for an influx of children with special needs.
1.7.6.9.2. Con: Many would argue that a short life of any brevity, where the child feels love for even the briefest time, is preferable both morally and from a survival instinct point of view, than the concept of non-existence.
1.7.6.9.3. Pro: [Figures](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/new-scottish-statistics-show-abortion-is-a-weapon-targeted-on-the-weak-and) released by the NHS in Scotland in 2016 showed an increase in abortions where there was a risk of a baby being born disabled, as well as a disproportionate number performed on women from the most deprived areas.
1.7.6.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.1.1.
1.7.7. Pro: In the future, genetic tests could be used to identify characteristics of the fetus \(such as attractiveness, intelligence, athletic ability\). Abortion could then be used as a selection tool.
1.7.7.1. Con: This presumes genetics won’t free us from the lottery of natural conception \(which seems like a likely result of such advances\).
1.7.7.2. Con: The inefficiency, effort and risk involved in using abortion as a means for genetic selection makes its use extremely unlikely, especially when less risky or invasive methods are readily available.
1.7.7.2.1. Pro: [Pre-implementation genetic diagnosis](https://www.hfea.gov.uk/treatments/embryo-testing-and-treatments-for-disease/pre-implantation-genetic-diagnosis-pgd/) \(PGD\) is one option that doesn't involve abortion, and it might be used to select for intelligence or attractiveness in the future
1.7.7.3. Con: This is based on the assumption that some abortions are morally questionable while others are not, which is inconsistent with the idea of women’s right to choose.
1.7.7.4. Pro: Aborting children purely on the grounds of future looks would be completely unethical and unreasonable.
1.7.7.4.1. Con: "Unreasonable" means "without reason". However the reason for an abortion in this case is that the fetus will grow up unsightly, which is a reason. One must substantiate that the harm of having an abortion supersedes the benefit of producing good looking children.
1.7.7.4.2. Con: This argument only addresses a specific reason for having an abortion. There are many other more compelling reasons for having an abortion. Unless the law were to differentiate the legality of abortions based on the mother's reasons for having the procedure, banning abortions for this reason would ban abortions for much more compelling reasons \(for example, the pregnancy is the result of rape, the baby suffers from a terminal defect, etc.\).
1.7.7.4.3. Con: All abortions are equal. It doesn't matter why you are aborting them; it's either wrong, or its not.
1.7.7.5. Con: In that case, banning genetic testing would be less costly than banning the practice of abortion itself.
1.7.7.5.1. Con: In the future, genetic testing will likely be easy to perform, high in demand, and cheap - making banning it near impossible.
1.7.8. Con: Banning an act because it "might" be used harmfully is unjust and does not take into account the benefits of the its usage.
1.7.8.1. Pro: If we banned everything that might be used in a bad way, we'd have no cars, guns, kitchen knives, etc.
1.7.8.2. Con: The magnitude of harm caused by designer babies, sex-selective abortions, and other forms of genetic selection are so great that they justify preemptive action.
1.8. Con: A significant proportion of the genetic material of the baby belongs to the male. Since the male has a large stake in the fate of the fetus, any decision regarding abortion should be made jointly by both parties, and not just by the woman.
1.8.1. Pro: No man should have to accept that his child's life, or future child's life, be prematurely ended just because the mother has decided so. Therefore, both the father and the mother should have the right to veto the abortion.
1.8.1.1. Con: Men do not have to face the physical or emotional burden of carrying the child to term, and so cannot have an equal say in a decision that would put a woman through that amount of stress and pain.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Men can face serious emotional harms from the decision to bring their child into this world or abort their child, even if they aren't the ones who have to carry it to term.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: Abortion is a "[death experience](http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=8089)" that is more trying than most people anticipate. When men try to convince themselves that the fetus held no meaning to them, they further harm themselves by not giving themselves time to grieve.
1.8.1.1.1.2. Con: While men face emotional harms, women face both emotional and physical harms as a result of being forced to carry a child to term. Therefor we ought to weigh the harms to the woman more heavily.
1.8.1.1.1.3. Pro: If a woman chooses to have an abortion, there is a consequence to the man if he desired having a child, or if he believes that abortion is immoral. In these cases the man could be harmed by the knowledge that his own child has been aborted.
1.8.1.1.1.4. Pro: If a woman chooses to keep a child when the man wants her to have an abortion, then he may feel pressure to be involved in the life of a child who he did not want, and even if he is not involved he may have a hard time accepting he now has a genetic child.
1.8.1.1.2. Con: The fact that women have a vested interest in shortening the pregnancy makes them less, not more, capable of making a decision that should place the child's interest first.
1.8.1.1.3. Con: Fathers-to-be experience [hormonal](https://www.nhs.uk/news/mental-health/fathers-to-be-experience-hormone-changes/) changes during pregnancy as well.
1.8.1.1.3.1. Con: The small [hormonal](https://www.nhs.uk/news/mental-health/fathers-to-be-experience-hormone-changes/) changes in men during pregnancy cannot be compared to the drastic changes women's bodies have to go through.
1.8.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.3.1.
1.8.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.
1.8.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.5.
1.8.1.1.7. Con: Fathers have to fund the child for a term of 18 years which would add to the emotional burden on the father and the father's family.
1.8.1.1.8. Pro: Men already have significantly more control over decisions about when they want to be a parent. Reproductively they do not have to carry the child, and therefore it is easier for them to remove themselves from the situation and say they do not want to be involved in parenting than it is for a woman. Abortion simply seeks to repair this inequality by giving women the ability to opt out of being parents as well.
1.8.1.1.8.1. Con: The point of abortion is not to reduce inequality. The point of abortion is to end a pregnancy. Any implications that come out of that are secondary.
1.8.1.1.8.2. Con: After the 9 month gestation period, the potential reproductive ramifications of a pregnancy are by and large the same for women and men. A woman can discharge their responsibility just as easily as a man.
1.8.1.1.8.3. Con: Men can opt out of becoming father figures without taking away the right of the woman to be a mother. When a woman opts out of motherhood via abortion, she is also deciding that the man cannot be a father. If a woman does not wish to be a parent, they may hand over the child to solely the father or an adoptive service.
1.8.1.1.8.3.1. Con: Unlike with a father opting out, a woman still has to carry the child for nine months and give birth before she would be able to opt out.
1.8.1.1.8.4. Con: The courts are biased against fathers, not mothers, when it comes to[custody decisions](https://nationalparentsorganization.org/blog/22457-studies-show-judicial-bias-against-dads) and[time spent with each parent](http://www.aeesq.com/2017/03/30/gender-bias-in-child-custody-court/). Women statistically are awarded[greater child support](https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/childsupport/cs07.html) than men are. Women are more likely to [initiate divorce](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-new-resilience/201508/women-initiate-divorce-much-more-men-heres-why).
This shows that if there is social inequality in whether one wants to be a parent or not, it is biased towards women.
1.8.1.1.9. Con: Men are [far less likely](https://nationalparentsorganization.org/blog/22457-studies-show-judicial-bias-against-dads) to obtain custody, and far more likely to be required to provide child support. Due to these statistics, fathers should have a voice in the abortion process.
1.8.1.1.9.1. Pro: Men should have the right to ask for abortion from their partner, as well as the right to oppose it.
1.8.1.1.9.1.1. Con: Men do have the right to ask or say just about anything they want to their partner. It's a free country.
1.8.1.1.9.2. Con: This only applies to when women choose not to abort. However, when women choose to abort, there is no physical, financial, or legal consequence to the man. Therefore that choice should be in the hands of the woman.
1.8.1.1.9.2.1. Con: -> See 1.8.1.1.1.3.
1.8.1.1.9.3. Con: Dads are [very likely](http://www.villainouscompany.com/vcblog/archives/2012/04/child_supportcu.html) to receive sole or joint custody if they fight, meaning currently less fathers fight than mothers for custody, not that they are less likely to achieve it.
1.8.1.1.9.4. Con: A simpler solution to the issue of child support for unwanted children would be to allow fathers to legally relinquish all parental rights and responsibilities to a child within a certain time frame of finding out that the child exists/will exist.
1.8.1.1.10. Pro: If the mother doesn't want to have it and the father does, she has to endure everything and have a child alive that she will know and didn't want. If the father wants to have a child that is half his he can pay for a womb or adopt. If not you will be forcing a woman to do something against her will with her own body, meaning in essence the father will own the mother.
1.8.1.2. Con: Just because a woman is carrying a child does not mean that she must live for the man.  The male should definitely be allowed input, but not to the detriment or at the expense of the unwilling female.
1.8.2. Con: In a [majority](http://blog.optionscorp.com/data-shows-that-women-are-primary-caregivers-of-family/) of cases a mother is the primary caregiver of a child and has to invest more time and energy in taking care of the child.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Women often have to sacrifice their careers for childbearing and child-rearing. This is not the case with men. For most women motherhood results in a wage penalty but for most men the fact of fatherhood results in a wage bonus.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: Studies suggest that among men with equivalent resumes, fathers are more likely to receive call-backs and higher wage offers than are childless men. Fatherhood may serve as a signal to potential employers for greater maturity, commitment, or stability. In the context of higher employer expectations for the “family man,” fathers are given less scrutiny for poor performance and more opportunities to demonstrate their abilities than are childless men. \([Pg.11](http://content.thirdway.org/publications/853/NEXT_-_Fatherhood_Motherhood.pdf)\)
1.8.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.3.
1.8.2.1.3. Pro: A [research](https://nypost.com/2017/02/27/this-one-tiny-thing-made-mens-careers-and-destroyed-womens/) conducted by a professor at Cornell University shows that while being a mother is proven to be a clear disadvantage when applying for jobs, it appears to serve as an advantage if you're a man with a child. The results showed that women with children were 50 percent less likely to get a response from an employer while men with children were slightly more likely than any other applicant to get a call back for an interview.
1.8.2.1.3.1. Pro: When a similar experiment was reproduced in laboratory settings, mothers were offered salaries of around $11,000 less than women without children. Fathers were offered salaries of around $2,000 more. \([Pg.1315](http://gender.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/motherhoodpenalty.pdf)\)
1.8.2.2. Con: What is true for the majority may not apply in every case - a father may wish to take on the role of a child's primary caregiver.
1.8.3. Con: Humans have two types of DNA, the one inside the nucleus which we obtain from both our parents and the one inside the mitochondria which although minimal in comparison can [only be passed on from the mother](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488913001092), that said, even in an strictly objective discussion the mother would still have the upper hand since there's more of her DNA in the embryo than there is of the father.
1.8.4. Con: In the cases of rape, incest, and other power situations, a woman should not need the guidance of the man to make personal decisions concerning her pregnancy.  The man should not be allowed to have any say whatsoever.
1.8.4.1. Con: While it is true, statistically speaking less than 1% of abortions performed in the USA are due to "power situations" \(meaning instances in which the woman didn't have sex with her consent\). So these instances can and should be dealt with on a case to case basis.[Some useful statistics.](http://abort73.com/abortion_facts/us_abortion_statistics/)
1.8.5. Pro: The new human life has [more genetic material in common with the father](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2015/03/03/genetically-more-like-dad/#.WkbPA1WnGpo) than the mother.
1.8.5.1. Con: This would be relevant if the physical, emotional and psychological impact of carrying a child to term were not so much greater on the mother. Science does not trump morality and ethics.
1.8.5.2. Con: This argument might come from an article that misinterpreted the original study, which definitively does not say anything like "a child has more genetic material in common with it's father". This paper does not support that claim at all. Genotype and phenotype are confused: indeed the paper suggests that the phenotype -protein expression patterns- are more father-like, not the genotype. so genetically speaking the child would still be an equal representation of both parents.
1.8.5.3. Con: Ignoring the veracity of the claim, genetic material does not matter. The biological parents of a child adopted by another family do not have the right to reclaim custody just because of their DNA. Biological parents who abuse their children can have their children seized by Child Protective Services because genetic relation does not equal the right to someone else's body and quality of life. A man cannot refuse a woman an abortion even if the fetus contains his genes.
1.8.6. Pro: [Half of the child's chromosomes are inherited from the father](https://www.23andme.com/gen101/origins/) to make up one of each chromosome pair.
1.8.6.1. Con: It isn't half if you take [mitochondrial DNA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA) into account.
1.8.7. Con: A genetic relationship to a child does not grant a person any rights that would supersede a mother's right to bodily autonomy.
1.8.7.1. Pro: The genetic makeup of an embryo should not be considered relevant. By analogy, the blueprints of a building are distinct from the potential building described, the genetic code of an embryo is distinct from the potential infant. A building is built by input of labor and materials from the workers that build it, and an infant is produced by the input of energy and materials from the mother in whose womb it grows. It is immoral to enslave a woman to the labor of producing an infant.
1.8.7.1.1. Con: The comparison to a building blueprints cannot remotely capture the complexity of discussing humanity and genetics. That said, regardless of definitions of start-of-life or nondescript labeling of living things, the father is still an integral dynamic in that decision. Understanding that many situations involve involuntary pregnancies, it is not the mother's right to determine whether the father of the future child deserves a voice. The implications of such have been and are devastating.
1.8.7.1.2. Pro: Genetic material is largely irrelevant to rights of ownership, as in cases of sperm donors, and miscarriages.  Framing a right around this principle leads to absurdity.
1.8.7.1.3. Con: To continue the building analogy; while the blueprints for the building are shared, so could be the costs of labour and materials. If the man "finances" the pregnancy, paying for food and accommodation, for example, he should surely then retain some rights over the foetus. In your analogy, we must ignore the cost of materials and ownership of the building is split by time among those who physically helped to build it.
1.8.7.2. Pro: If a pregnancy is the result of rape, the rapist would also have contributed half of the genetic material to the pregnancy. If the amount of genetic material contributed gives a person a right to choose, then a rapist would have as much right to that choice as the victim of his rape.
1.8.7.2.1. Con: When any individual commits and is convicted of an illegal act, they lose some of their freedoms. It stands to reason that if the father of the child were a convicted rapist, they would not legally have a right to the child.
1.8.7.3. Pro: If someone were to end up with an organ from an organ donor, the donor should not get to have a say about what the receiver can and can't do with that organ simply because it contains his or her genetic material.
1.8.7.4. Pro: The amount of DNA is irrelevant when it is the woman's body that will be subjected to pregnancy and its consequences, and, ultimately, the man has no ownership over that body. After all, a man does not have the right to rape a woman as part of the right to conceive a child, even if he is in a relationship with her. No one can force a child into existence in any way when the vessel is someone else's body.
1.8.8. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.1.9.
1.8.9. Con: There may be cases where the man and woman have fundamentally different views about what they should do regarding a pregnancy. In these instances, the woman's view is more important as otherwise she is being forced to either carry a child or have a medical procedure she does not want.
1.8.9.1. Pro: Having a child affects a woman far more than it does a man. Birth is painful and hazardous \(even with modern medical advances\). Having a child reduces income earning potential of the mother but not the father.  Therefore, at a minimum, the woman should have more of a say.
1.8.9.2. Con: Asking the male provider of the baby's genetic material, what their opinion is, is not the same thing as giving the male a veto, and it is preferable to women making the decision to have an abortion unilaterally.
1.8.9.3. Pro: A jointly made decision is not viable, save under limited circumstances \(marriage, long-term monogamous relationships, women lying about contraception\). Dangers include not only control established through impregnation by rape and incest, but also coercive behavior on the part of the sperm provider \(term used to be inclusive\), especially if the situation resulting in pregnancy does not constitute rape in a strictly legal sense, but is still a violation of one's human right to sexual choice.
1.8.10. Con: Legalising abortion would not legally exempt the man from any decisions made in terms of the fetus's life. Whether or not the father is brought into discussion is not the laws decision \(as there might be special circumstances, eg. rape, where the father is not involved\).
1.8.11. Con: This claim is irrelevant. It has nothing to do with the initial question of whether abortion should be legal.
1.8.12. Pro: The destiny of a human's life is much more than the 9 months that they are being carried in their mother's womb, and deserves the input of both parents.
1.8.13. Con: Unless the genetic material was taken by force, the delivery of said genetic material suggests that any legal claim of ownership has been waived.
1.8.14. Pro: Men should have rights over reproductive capacities equal to those of women. If one partner in the sexual relationship broke the other's trust, such as through lying about contraception or coercing the other partner into sex, then the decision regarding an abortion should be made by the deceived partner.
1.8.14.1. Con: It's virtually impossible to prove deceit, and the process of determining who is responsible to make the decision will almost certainly take too long, given that pregnancy is a rapidly developing medical condition.
1.8.14.2. Con: It is not legitimate for one person to force another to have a medical procedure they do not want. Therefore, it is unreasonable to give men this amount of control in the decision, even if they were deceived.
1.8.14.2.1. Con: It is also not legitimate for one person to force unwanted parenthood on another. Both abortions and parenthood are irreversible and carry an emotional cost, but parenthood carries life-long responsibilities and commitment, which could be considered more long-lasting and severe than an unwanted medical procedure.
1.8.14.2.2. Con: It is impossible to quantify the cost for either member in the case of deception. However if the woman deceived the man she should bear some of the cost, and not get away scott-free from what in other circumstances would be minimally considered the crime of embezzlement \(given trust over resources, but using them to profit oneself\). It goes without saying a man would get his just punishment in deceiving a woman, in terms of the lifelong emotional pain and suffering he causes.
1.8.15. Con: -> See 1.8.1.1.
1.8.16. Con: [Biblically](http://www.humanreligions.info/women_as_objects.html), women have a special place - as objects of beauty and as possessions. Her father or husband must decide.
1.8.16.1. Con: What the Bible says is irrelevant for jurisdiction. Religion shouldn't influence law.
1.8.16.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.9.
1.8.16.2. Con: These catholic principles are archaic and irrelevant.
1.8.16.2.1. Pro: Scriptures are not necessarily meant to be taken literally by-the-word. They have more meaning than is immediately obvious. In this scenario, saying women are beautiful does not mean men get the "upper hand", but because they are both equally responsible for the child they both should get an equal say.
1.8.16.2.2. Pro: Many believers do not take scriptures literally.
1.8.16.2.2.1. Pro: Even fundamentalist Christians [do not take the Bible literally.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-mcswain/fundamentalist-christians_b_4999800.html)
1.8.16.2.2.1.1. Con: Rather than concede that difficult statements in the Bible must be figurative, such as the command to stone children, [online sources](http://biblehub.com/commentaries/deuteronomy/21-21.htm) show that fundamentalist Christians tend to find a literal interpretations that are more easily acceptable.
1.8.16.3. Con: This claim assumes that women are less capable than men of making choices about their own lives and well-being.
1.8.16.4. Con: Other religions and cultures should not be expected to follow the Bible's teachings without other, non-religious reasons.
1.8.16.4.1. Con: The fundamental tenets of this book and many \(if not all\) books of faith, and even of proto-religious, oral, and/or animist/ancestor cult traditions are, broadly speaking, in harmony; within these echoed exhortations and morays, across many cultures, the contemporary anachronism of women as chattel and "objects of beauty" is present. It is not unique to the Judeo-Christian tradition, but is pan-global in a historical context.
1.8.16.4.1.1. Con: The legalities of abortion shouldn't rest on anything "broad" written in a time where the knowledge of an atom or germ was yet to be discovered. That primitive reality is ill equipped to consider the 21st century implications of this debate.
1.8.17. Con: Men are likely to pressure women to keep or abort the child, depending on what they see fit for themselves.
1.8.17.1. Pro: In this situation if the father wanted to abort and the mother didn't there would be no way to resolve this and it would be unreasonable for the law to force a woman to have an abortion.
1.8.17.1.1. Con: A male should have the right to opt out of the child's life without physical, emotional or financial recourse upon learning of a pregnancy. If he took this option, he would also have no legal say in the rearing of the child.
1.8.17.2. Pro: Abortion helps legitimize male abandonment of pregnant women and not paying child support as it makes women choosing to keep the baby a lifestyle choice.
1.8.17.2.1. Con: Abandonment of pregnant women and men not taking their part in their responsibility should be solved by education and a better culture, not by preventing abortion as a choice.
1.8.17.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.1.8.
1.8.17.4. Con: The thesis is that men should be involved in the discussion precisely to have their opinion heard. Furthermore, the word pressure is highly subjective.
1.8.17.5. Pro: Men generally tend to have more social capital in society than women. Even today women are blamed for the crimes of men in cases such as sexual assault. We should correct for this asymmetry of power by giving women choice in this matter.
1.8.17.5.1. Con: Even if the premise that men have greater social capital was always true, it is not a problem that would be logically or ethically corrected, even in part, by allowing abortion. Even in a horrific case such as rape, terminating the unborn child would not fix or correct the sexual assault.
1.8.17.6. Con: If women solely make the abortion choice, they apply the ultimate pressure by forcing their will. Any pressure applied by men pales in comparison.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.2.7.5.1.
1.10. Pro: Making abortion accessible brings a variety of social benefits.
1.10.1. Pro: Unless women have the right to choose abortion, the planet will exceed its [carrying capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity).
1.10.1.1. Con: Concerns about overpopulation and exceeding a carrying capacity are unfounded.
1.10.1.1.1. Pro: Applied to humans, carrying capacity is an ill-defined concept. The underlying assumption of the carrying capacity argument is that there is a fixed number of people the Earth can sustain. This is simply not the case. As humans change the environment, they also modify the amount of resources available to them. The concept of carrying capacity only makes sense when applied to non-human animals, which do not have the abilities to significantly alter their environment.
1.10.1.1.1.1. Con: All closed systems must by definition have finite resources. The earth is a closed system, therefore there are finite resources and human activity will not change that fact. Our ability to recover used resources is questionable and a goal post that will move, but the amount available will not.
1.10.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Since the earth receives energy from the sun, it is an open system with regard to energy. Humans have the ability to change carrying capacity in all sorts of ways. Advancements in solar power efficiency, for example, could lead to a higher carrying capacity.
1.10.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Energy is different from matter. Solar energy allows plants and/or humans to process matter. Higher carrying capacity means more materials/matter and space, since we can't have that, we can't increase the planets carrying capacity.
1.10.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Even technology like a skyscraper changes the carrying capacity. More people fit with one than without. While there may be theoretical upper limits, the carrying capacity of the Earth isn't fixed.
1.10.1.1.2. Pro: Overpopulation "fear mongering" is unfounded and as societies improve [the number of children reduce over time](https://youtu.be/QsBT5EQt348), as shown by the [Mouse Utopia/Behavioral Sink Experiment](https://youtu.be/HfNKFvHtA3g). Nature will correct itself in one way or another before overpopulation becomes a problem.
1.10.1.1.3. Pro: Plenty of other factors are accelerating a trend of reducing birth rates already in the status quo.
1.10.1.1.3.1. Pro: There is a rise in the accessibility of effective forms of contraception.
1.10.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: In [developed](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth/#population-growth-by-the-level-of-development) countries where birth control is readily available population growth is already negative. Those populations are only growing through immigration, not birthrate.
1.10.1.1.3.2. Pro: Increased urbanization, on the aggregate, gives people better access to family planning and increases competition for space.
1.10.1.1.3.3. Pro: As countries develop more, costs of raising children increase as education standards \(and costs\) rise and it takes longer before children enter the workforce.
1.10.1.1.3.4. Pro: Development leads to proper pension programs, which decrease the necessity for children to take care of oneself in old age
1.10.1.1.4. Pro: At any point the planet could experience a catastrophic event that would drastically reduce the human population. Viral illness, famine, earthquakes near nuclear plants, loss of power grid integrity, etc. We should not end human life to avoid hypothetical future capacity issues.
1.10.1.1.4.1. Con: Modern science and technology has drastically reduced the likelihood of widespread catastrophic events such as viruses, disease, and famine.
1.10.1.1.4.2. Con: Capacity issues are not hypothetical. We already have issues of access to clean water, crops, energy, etc.
1.10.1.1.5. Pro: People living in more developed countries have relatively cheap and accessible birth control already. And population growth is not the immediate problem many think it is. In fact, countries like Denmark offer incentives to couples that bear several children. Their fertility rate is currently at [1.73](https://www.indexmundi.com/denmark/total_fertility_rate.html), sure to result in a population decrease within their borders and financial distress for a generation that will have to care for a large, aging population.
1.10.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.5.1.2.
1.10.1.1.7. Pro: The growth curve for K selected animals \(including humans\) is logistic as it reaches carrying capacity, not exponential. Therefore as human population increases, growth rate slows down.
1.10.1.2. Pro: Abortion has an indirect effect on population growth because women are able to postpone marriage and childbearing where abortion is available, rather than having to get married at a young age because of an unintended pregnancy. The result of these later marriages is that fewer children are born than would be the case if women married at a younger age. \(The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History, Volume 1, [pg.14](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&lpg=PA14&ots=o_cTS_axlJ&dq=women%20are%20able%20to%20postpone%20marriage%20and%20childbearing%20where%20abortion%20is%20available%2C%20rather%20than%20having%20to%20get%20married%20at%20a%20young%20age%20because%20of%20an%20unintended%20pregnancy.&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.10.1.3. Con: Concerns about overpopulation are an incentive to promote contraception, not to promote abortion.
1.10.1.4. Con: Concerns about exceeding the carrying capacity some time in the future are not a good reason to justify abortion, as ending life is not a reasonable response to over population.
1.10.1.4.1. Pro: Society does not allow one person to terminate the life of another, such as a mother murdering her five year old, to keep the planet's population down. If terminating an older child is ethically unacceptable to stave off overpopulation, then terminating the unborn for reasons of population growth is ethically unsustainable.
1.10.1.4.1.1. Pro: If this argument is taken to its logical conclusion, the elderly, the mentally disabled, criminals, the poor, and any other group can also be eliminated for the sake of population control.
1.10.1.4.2. Pro: The solution to overpopulation is not killing individuals \(that is what the Nazis thought\). One should rather invest in sexual education and teach responsibility.
1.10.1.4.3. Con: It can be difficult to predict what levels of over population will be catastrophic for the earth, and therefore it is important to consider methods for population control now.
1.10.1.4.4. Pro: Saying abortions are good for population control is like saying that concentration camps are good for unemployment.
1.10.1.4.5. Pro: Genocide could be a form of population control but morality rules it out, as it does abortion.
1.10.1.5. Con: If this is true, then the burden is on us to formulate a solution which does not sacrifice the moral values that our civilization is predicated on. Abortion erodes those values, birth control does not.
1.10.1.6. Con: This statement assumes that that abortion is the only means of preventing childbirth. This is a faulty assumption. Abortion is only one of several different forms of birth control. It also assumes that men and women have no choice in engaging in intercourse. Practicing abstinence \(which can be done by either of parties involved\) is a lower health risk, no financial cost, more widely available alternative to prevent overpopulation.
1.10.1.7. Con: If we determine that losing lives is necessary to resolve overpopulation then this could equally be done by making abortion illegal, as many women die from accessing illegal abortions.
1.10.1.8. Pro: Every additional human contributes to an increase in humanity's [carbon footprint](https://www.carbonfootprint.com/) on the planet.
1.10.1.8.1. Con: The net marginal impact on climate change of another person existing is far smaller than the comparable impact on a child's life. This issue is relatively unimportant.
1.10.1.8.2. Con: -> See 1.10.1.1.3.1.1.
1.10.1.8.3. Con: Carbon footprint per capita varies greatly across the world. Reducing each person's footprint is more effective and more important than reducing the number of people, as the number of people born will always be a small fraction of the number of people alive.
1.10.1.8.3.1. Con: Having one less child reduces an adult's carbon emissions by an average of [58.6](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/07/11/save-planet-cut-holidays-sell-car-dont-have-many-children-say/) tonnes of CO2 per year. Other lifestyle changes result in a much tinier reduction in an adults carbon footprint. For example, if an adult decides not to drive, this only saves around [2.4 tonnes](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/07/11/save-planet-cut-holidays-sell-car-dont-have-many-children-say/) of C02 per year. If an adult decides to not eat meat, this only saves [0.8 tonnes](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children) of C02 a year.
1.10.1.9. Pro: Without legalised abortion, population size will increase. An increased global population will put a strain on resources, potentially resulting in [large scale poverty and starvation](https://web.archive.org/web/20120302185414/http://www.dpi.inpe.br/sil/cst310/Aula2_fundamentos/THE_POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf).
1.10.1.9.1. Pro: It is difficult for states, particularly in the developing world, to provide services and infrastructure, to support expanding populations.
1.10.1.9.2. Con: If the poorest 5 billion people use the same resources per capita as the richest 2 billion, [not even 5 planet earths](http://bigthink.com/big-think-tv/hans-rosling-illustrates-future-energy-consumption-with-legos) will be enough. The effect of reducing population through abortion is insignificant when compared to the potential effects of changes in technology and lifestyles.
1.10.1.9.3. Con: The addition of extra human beings on the planet is not necessarily to the detriment of those already living. Indeed, a shortage of new human beings results in the state having less revenue, since there are less working- age tax payers. This makes it harder for the state to fund healthcare and [pensions](https://www.ft.com/content/49b3fcd4-63f9-11e6-a08a-c7ac04ef00aa) for all of its citizens.
1.10.1.9.4. Con: The amount of people using contraceptives, sterilizing themselves, and/or choosing not to have children will likely already lead to a slowing in population growth.
1.10.1.9.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.1.3.1.1.
1.10.1.9.5. Con: China has seen significant population [growth](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/china-population/) recently, even with the one-child policy, yet is a [middle income](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-middle-class/) country.
1.10.1.9.5.1. Con: China has revoked the one child policy for parents who were both only children. These couples are now allowed to have two children.
1.10.1.9.5.2. Con: The one child policy has frequently been circumvented by simply paying a fine to be permitted to have more than one child.
1.10.1.9.6. Con: Population growth as a problem is [overstated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FACK2knC08E).
1.10.1.10. Con: Abortion is not an effective tool for population control.
1.10.1.10.1. Con: Abortion would mean that people who accidentally become pregnant past the population limit would not be subject to any of the penal systems associated with that limit, or the pain of giving up a fully grown baby because government penalties forced them to.
1.10.1.10.2. Pro: If women are likely to have abortions regardless of whether it is legal or illegal, then the right to abortion doesn't prevent humans from passing some sort of environmental tipping point or carrying capacity.
1.10.1.10.3. Con: Abortion is one of many methods to aid in population control. As one-size-fits-all solutions rarely work effectively in complex systems, it is important to have many legal methods available.
1.10.1.10.4. Pro: The easiest way to stop population growth is to not have unprotected sex off birth control.
1.10.1.10.5. Pro: [It has been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3709011) that widespread availability of abortion is not a sufficient condition to solve the problem of global population growth.
1.10.1.10.6. Pro: Assuming a carrying capacity exists, governments would impose birth limits. Abortion is a poor birth control method as it is reactive and not proactive.
1.10.1.10.7. Pro: Not enough people get abortions to have a meaningful impact on population size.
1.10.1.10.7.1. Pro: Abortion rates have been [decreasing](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states) steadily over the past few decades in the US. Factors such as greater access to contraceptives have meant that fewer and fewer women use abortion.
1.10.1.10.7.1.1. Con: According to that source, 19 percent of pregnancies ended in abortion in 2014. That is almost 1 in 5. Just because they are decreasing doesn't mean "not enough people get abortions to have a meaningful impact on population size." Nineteen percent is a meaningful impact.
1.10.1.10.7.2. Con: Not having a child is the most significant thing an adult can do to reduce their carbon footprint. Every additional child a parent has will result in an extra [58 tonnes](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children) of CO2 being emmitted per year.
1.10.2. Pro: Abortion is a necessary [public good](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/abortion-right-to-privacy-women-right-to-equality) - it is good for everyone if women only have the children they want and can raise well.
1.10.2.1. Pro: Society has an interest in having a healthy and well educated population. Access to abortion supports that interest in avoiding unnecessary population growth and unwanted children.
1.10.2.2. Con: If raising only children a mother wants is a moral good, then for the logic to be consistent she must also be allowed to have legal access to infanticide when she does not want to raise a child. Wantedness is therefore not a justification for legalization of abortion.
1.10.2.3. Pro: When women cannot afford to raise their children they are forced to go on welfare, which is a cost to everyone.
1.10.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.5.
1.10.2.3.2. Con: Society is best when we look out for others and therefore supporting people, where needed, through welfare is not necessarily a bad thing.
1.10.2.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.4.2.2.2.
1.10.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.1.1.
1.10.2.5. Pro: Many women who become pregnant are still in high school and are [forced to drop out](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/teen-pregnancy-affects-graduation-rates-postcard.aspx).
1.10.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.9.6.2.2.
1.10.2.7. Pro: Even if women are out of high school, unwanted pregnancy can force them to leave their jobs, furthering inequality in the workforce.
1.10.2.7.1. Con: Preference for equality in the workforce is not a satisfactory reason for abortion.  Many childless women are treated unequally in the workforce as it is.  We can strive for equality whilst also supporting childbearing.
1.10.2.7.1.1. Con: One of the reasons why women are treated unequally in the workforce is that employers assume women can get pregnant and leave their job any time. If we deny women the option to terminate unwanted pregnancies we further increase this perceived risk of them leaving their jobs due to pregnancy, which in turn encourages discrimination and confirms prejudices.
1.10.2.7.1.1.1. Pro: The option to have an abortion gives women more autonomy over their careers, as it allows them to plan ahead and discuss maternity leave with their employers before actually needing it.
1.10.2.7.1.2. Con: Giving women the right to have an abortion if they want to does not oppose or contradict support for childbearing. Allowing women a choice does not make anything compulsory.
1.10.2.8. Con: Just because a child isn't raised well or wanted doesn't mean the child doesn't have the right to life.
1.10.2.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.8.3.
1.10.2.8.2. Con: A harder life is often a life that will lead an individual to resort to crime, thus harming the quality of life of others.
1.10.2.8.2.1. Con: Then we should kill every poor person, because, since their life is hard, they could harm the quality of life of others. If humanity make life and death choices based on probability rather than heart and compassion, many innocent people will die.
1.10.2.9. Con: This would be true only if you exclude the unborn in the definition of "everyone".
1.10.2.10. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.1.1.1.
1.10.3. Pro: Everyone benefits if women are able to [commit](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/abortion-right-to-privacy-women-right-to-equality) to work and education, without having to worry about getting derailed in life due to an unplanned pregnancy.
1.10.3.1. Con: Women do not have to have an abortion in order to achieve education and work related goals. Feminists should lobby the state to provide better day care facillitiies and welfare subsidies for mothers, instead of advocating for abortion rights.
1.10.3.1.1. Con: No amount of social support can negate the long-term difficulties that working or studying mothers have to face. It is unfair to suggest that better social support would make these women's lives as easy as those of childless women.
1.10.3.1.1.1. Pro: Parents in the US, on average, are less [happy](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/july_newsletter_are_you_a_miserable_parent) than their childless counterparts.
1.10.3.1.2. Con: The two things are not mutually exclusive. One can advocate simultaneously for [economic, social and cultural rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic,_social_and_cultural_rights) and for[civil and political rights.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights)
1.10.3.1.3. Con: This implies that not having an abortion will work for every woman who is pursuing education or career goals.  Some women may carry a child to term and be successful with the extra work load.  Other women will find themselves unable to meet their goals while also giving a child the care that they need.  Whether a women has an abortion or not, they are still making sacrifices.
1.10.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.3.
1.10.3.3. Pro: Pregnancy will always have more of an impact on a woman than a man.  Pregnancy is a major medical condition that will limit their ability to work during and after the pregnancy.  Women make far greater sacrifices to become mothers than men, and that is a biological fact \(physically and emotionally\).  A man doesn't have to participate in the pregnancy, but can seek custody after the baby is born, which has it's own negative implications, particularly if the father is abusive.
1.10.3.4. Pro: Between 1970 and 1990 The Pill accounted for nearly three quarters of the increase in the number of women who became doctors and lawyers. The right to abortion contributed significantly to the same [phenomenon](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/abortion-right-to-privacy-women-right-to-equality).
1.10.3.4.1. Con: A society has real reason to question its morality and values when social improvement can be counted and measured in the number of human lives lost.
1.10.3.4.1.1. Pro: The quality of society can be measured by its ability to support and preserve life
1.10.3.4.2. Con: The contraceptive pill is not the same as abortion. Any attempt to equate them is misleading and incorrect. Improved levels of education, increased demand for lawyers and doctors, changes in traditional beliefs that women should work, and TV shows depicting women doing more than just minding kids likely all contributed to an increase in women professionals too.
1.10.3.4.2.1. Con: The Pill and abortions are not equal, but in effect they complement each other - they give women the power to determine their readiness for reproduction.
1.10.3.4.2.2. Con: The Pill had a radical effect on society - it meant that for the first time in human history, women gained control of their sexuality. Single women have been having sex since the beginning of history, but it was only from the 1960s onwards that they were able to do this without the imminent threat of [pregnancy](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/05/06/pogrebin.pill.roundup/index.html).
1.10.3.4.2.2.1. Con: The sexual liberation of any individual or social group, does not necessarily equate to true individual liberty or contribute towards social improvement.
1.10.3.4.2.3. Con: In the 1960s - when The Pill was introduced in the US - employers could \(without penalty\) fire a woman who got [pregnant](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/05/06/pogrebin.pill.roundup/index.html).
1.10.3.4.2.4. Con: With The Pill, large numbers of college women could embark on careers that involved long-term, up-front time commitments in education and training as physicians, lawyers, veterinarians, managers, and academics, among others. A pregnancy could derail a career, but The Pill enabled women to stay on [track](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/05/06/pogrebin.pill.roundup/index.html).
1.10.3.5. Con: The millions of humans who have their life taken by abortion do not benefit from it. Instead, they are deprived of the rest of their life. This is like saying killing newborns by the millions would benefit everyone. It conveniently leaves out the victims and therefore is incorrect.
1.10.3.6. Con: Free child care, more part-time roles, free access to online and distance education programs, encouraging men to raise children and other social programs, are all more favourable and beneficial ways to help women lead full and productive lives. Furthermore, there is no evidence that abortion provides any long or midterm social benefits to women, and there are physical and psychological risks for the woman associated with abortion.
1.10.4. Con: Social benefits should not be an important factor in decisions concerning life or death.
1.10.5. Pro: We live in a world of limited resources. As a society we will be better off resources are devoted to children who are raised and supported by parents with the means and interest in producing productive members of society.
1.10.5.1. Con: You can achieve this preventing pregnancy. It doesn't justify murdering.
1.10.6. Con: Murder is morally wrong. A woman isn't justified in killing a child for any reasons particularly her own 'social benefit. This claim is glib and insulting and makes it sound as murder is a gift to society that just keeps on giving!
1.10.6.1. Con: Roe v Wade determined that in the US a fetus is [not legally recognised](https://rewire.news/article/2013/01/03/fetal-personhood-laws-juridical-persons-are-not-natural-persons-and-why-it-matter/) as a person.
1.10.6.1.1. Con: As admitted in the article cited, the Supreme Court of the U.S. is not an infallible arbiter of who counts as a person with rights.
1.10.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.2.
1.10.6.1.3. Pro: The right to life is fundamental, but life begins at independent viability.
1.10.6.1.3.1. Con: Left to its own natural development a fetus will develop and be born. The externality of abortion changes this fact and therefore can only be considered killing/murder. For this reason any definition of life that begins with viability cannot be substantiated.
1.10.6.1.3.1.1. Con: There is no guarantee that a fetus 'left untouched' would develop into a baby. Regrettably, miscarriages may occur.
1.10.6.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Miscarriages are remarkably common and as many as 1 in 4 pregnancies end in [miscarriage](https://www.tommys.org/our-organisation/charity-research/pregnancy-statistics/miscarriage).
1.10.6.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Since the above claim is under the "Life begins as conception" branch and its source says, we should research why miscarriage happens to "save lives and prevent future loss," it fits as a pro argument. If preventing miscarriage would save lives so would not aborting babies.
1.10.6.1.3.1.2. Con: This argument is [begging the question](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/begging-the-question). Calling the abortion of a fetus murder presupposes that the fetus is a life capable of being murdered. Asserting that life must begin before viability based on the declaration that terminating it is considered murder is circular reasoning.
1.10.6.1.3.2. Con: Just as it would be unethical to separate conjoined twins if only one had enough vital organs to survive, it is unethical to separate a fetus from his/her mother. Just as the 'non-viable' twin has a right to life supporting organs, so does the fetus.
1.10.6.1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.1.
1.10.6.1.3.2.2. Con: In the case of [parasitic conjoined twins](http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=82566&page=1), where the life of one twin would mean significant hardship or death for the other, parents are allowed to separate them, ending the life of the reliant twin. If this procedure is legal and ethical, then the choice to abort, when the fetus isn't even fully formed, should be.
1.10.6.1.3.2.2.1. Con: The unborn child is generally not in a parasitical relationship with the mother. While the unborn human does receive nutrients from the mother, the relationship is symbiotic both for the mother and [for the species](https://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/index_53294.html). The mother receives [benefits](https://www.todaysparent.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-perks-the-health-benefits-for-mom/) such as reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancer, eventual reduction of period pain, higher estrogen levels, lower risk of MS, etc. The fetus [even 'donates' stem cells to the mom to treat problems like heart disease](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21185-fetus-donates-stem-cells-to-heal-mothers-heart/).
1.10.6.1.3.3. Con: Viability is one of the weaker arguments. A human on life-support isn't viable, but we still believe they are are human beings with rights.
1.10.6.1.3.3.1. Con: This obscures the order in which personhood is first attained. A human on life-support attains viability before losing it in this example.
1.10.6.1.3.3.2. Con: Life support is legally allowed to be turned off meaning they lack an absolute right to life.
1.10.6.1.3.4. Con: Independent viability is a moveable target, so irrelevant to the ethics of life and value. No one is 'viable' in an environment contrary to the needs of survival, such as a child in the ocean or an adult in the vacuum of space.
1.10.6.1.3.4.1. Pro: Future technology may be able to develop an artificial womb or incubation method as an alternative to pregnancy.  This means what is "viable" is partially dependent upon current technology and doesn't ultimately answer the question.
1.10.6.1.3.5. Con: Humans are not dead pre-birth and alive post-birth. Birth doesn't mark the beginning of life, development, or growth, but rather the passage of a human life from the womb to the outside world, and from receiving nutrients via the placenta to eating/breathing with the digestive system and lungs, respectively.
1.10.6.1.3.5.1. Con: Considering a fetus a human life just before birth is almost irrelevant to the abortion discussion, when [less than 1% of abortions are done after the 21st week.](https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/later-abortion)
1.10.6.1.3.6. Pro: When a fetus is able to exist independently from the mother's body they can be considered to be independent living beings. At this stage they are not reliant on someone to maintain their life, which makes them more independent.
1.10.6.1.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.6.1.3.2.2.
1.10.6.1.3.6.2. Con: The major difference between an unborn baby and baby is the degree to which they rely on someone else. Everyone relies on other people to survive. Embracing this fact would make people less selfish, and less lonely.
1.10.6.1.3.6.3. Con: When people become incredibly sick and are dependent on machines or other people to keep them alive, we still consider them to be living beings.
1.10.6.1.3.6.4. Con: An infant is not independent of his mother post-birth, and will die if exposed or not given food, etc. Independence, then, is not a reason one life is more valuable than another.
1.10.6.1.3.6.4.1. Con: While an infant requires care by an adult, the ability for the infant to remain alive is not dependent on being physically attached to an adult at all times. In this way, it is still significantly more independent than pre-birth.
1.10.6.1.3.7. Con: -> See 1.10.6.1.3.6.4.
1.10.6.1.3.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.25.3.
1.10.6.1.3.9. Con: Even though a fetus cannot necessarily exist outside a mother's body immediately, it is a living being with the potential to live a full life and therefore should be protected.
1.10.6.1.3.9.1. Con: The potential to have a full life does not guarantee that the life should be protected. A person dying of kidney failure still has the potential for full life, but that does not grant them the right to risk the life of someone else by demanding a kidney transplant. In the same way, a fetus with the potential for full life cannot demand the use of the mothers body because pregnancy risks the mothers life.
1.10.6.1.3.9.1.1. Con: This is not a very good example. The person dying of kidney failure is not being euthanized, but is receiving all the medical treatment needed to maintain the best quality life possible until their natural death. Pregnancies that risk the mothers life are an entirely different argument.
1.10.6.1.3.9.1.2. Con: This argument may be valid for risky pregnancies, but not for the unrestricted right to abortion, since most pregnancies do not present imminent risk.
1.10.6.1.3.9.2. Pro: Allowing abortions means allowing people to end potential lives, removing all future possibilities of this being existing and having their own desires and wants.
1.10.6.1.3.9.2.1. Con: By that argument no woman could turn down sex or use a contraceptive.
1.10.6.1.3.9.2.2. Con: It's philosophically untenable for a 3rd party to make an argument for just one of another person's potential futures, against that person's own interest. Almost anything could conceivably prevent almost anything else in the future; it's called the [butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect). A woman might have 2 children after a few years, but only if she weren't already having a child this year.
1.10.6.1.3.9.3. Pro: The rights of an unborn child should not be seen as less valid than the rights of a deceased grandparent. Pre-natal rights are very analogous to funeral rights — where the subject's current rights, and status of life are largely immaterial in view of the potential exercise of rights before they were deceased.  This is not meaningfully different than the potential exercise of rights after birth.
1.10.6.1.3.9.4. Con: The vast majority of conceptions fail, either due to miscarriage or because the fertilised egg never implants in the uterus. Human reproduction is just too inefficient to consider conception the beginning of even a potential life.
1.10.6.1.3.9.5. Pro: A baby in the womb isn't just a ball of [tissue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDmwPGrZkYs). Even if it is only considered potential for human life, it still has value.
1.10.6.1.3.9.6. Pro: Even if the fetus is not "human" in the sense that it looks, walks, and talks like us, the fetus has potentiality. Left untouched, it will develop naturally into a person.
1.10.6.1.3.9.6.1. Con: -> See 1.10.6.1.3.1.1.
1.10.6.1.3.9.6.2. Pro: As soon as fertilization takes place, it's unclear at what point conscious life begins for the baby. It is clear that there is no conscious life before fertilization and that there is after. Because of this it would be unethical to take a life from a possible conscious being.
1.10.6.1.3.9.6.3. Con: A fetus left untouched would immediately fail and never grow into a human. A mother has to touch the fetus with her uterus and an umbilical cord.
1.10.6.1.3.9.6.4. Pro: Someone who is in a temporary coma is not conscious or actively alive, but we acknowledge they have rights because they are going to wake up.
1.10.6.1.3.9.6.4.1. Con: People in comas do not need to live inside a human being, and if they did, you would definitely be allowed to take them out.
1.10.6.1.3.9.6.4.2. Con: It is implicitly understood that with few exceptions, people in comas had previously demonstrated their intent and ability to continue living.
1.10.6.1.3.9.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.11.
1.10.6.1.3.9.6.6. Con: Leaving the fetus in the womb is not the same as leaving it "untouched". At multiple stages fetus requires assistance from the mothers body or it will cease to develop and quickly die. The assistance from the mothers womb is "touching" the fetus.
1.10.6.1.3.9.6.7. Con: "Untouched" implies that the womb is a stagnant, independent environment for the fetus to grow. The womb has a constant influx of energy and nutrients, and constant efflux of wastes. The above claim ignores - or even dehumanizes - the woman's role in providing the nutrients and receiving the wastes.
1.10.6.1.3.9.7. Pro: Abortion takes away any future experiences \(good and bad\) from a baby that was meant to be born. While you might not consider abortion to be same as murder, the same thing that is wrong with abortion is wrong with murder. Killing somebody is not wrong because their heart stops or they stop to think, but because they lose their future selves.
1.10.6.1.3.9.7.1. Con: The concept of a baby being "meant to be born" can as easily be rephrased as "not meant to be born" and abortion being just the tool to achieve this. For a thing to be meant to happen, there has to be something higher that is meaning for it to happen. Unless that something shares with us what it wants and what it does not, using this sort of argument does not make sense. Provided that [something higher even exists](https://www.kialo.com/the-existence-of-god-2629), of course.
1.10.6.1.3.9.7.1.1. Con: In this line of thinking all murder is ok. You could just say a person is not meant to be alive and murder is the vehicle to do so. All murder would be acceptable under this thinking because life is meaningless without a higher power.
1.10.6.1.3.9.8. Con: It is also true that all eggs and sperm could form to create potential lives. If it is determined that potential lives should therefore be protected, an extreme version of this argument would be that people should not use contraception as then they are stopping potential lives from coming to fruition.
1.10.6.1.3.9.8.1. Con: Though eggs and sperm are living beings, there is no science claiming that they are specifically human beings already. The protection of potential life refers to the future of already human beings, not pre-human organisms.
1.10.6.1.3.9.9. Con: If potential to live a full life is the sine qua non for legal protection, such legal protections would not extend to those with congenital abnormalities that would deny them the potential for a full life. Furthermore, the meaning of "full life" is ambiguous, does it mean a long life, or a personally fulfilling life, or a life full of normal experiences? How this is defined might not protect a fetus that would be born under different racial, ethnic, religious, and socio-economic circumstances.
1.10.6.1.4. Con: When this was determined, ultrasonography was not widely used in America to see images of babies in the [womb](https://www.livescience.com/32071-history-of-fetal-ultrasound.html). These images allow us to see their development and early human form. Also, we have since made significant advancements in [genomics](https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/timeline-history-of-genomics) allowing us to see that babies in the womb are genetically human beginning at [conception](http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-genes-human-embryo-development-20150903-story.html). Further, we have made progress in the ability to keep premature babies [alive](http://www.radiolab.org/story/update-23-weeks-6-days/). These scientific advancements warrant a reconsideration of the Roe v Wade decision.
1.10.6.1.5. Con: The law does not necessarily always reflect what should be the case. Morally, one can still argue that a fetus should be recognised as a person.
1.10.6.1.5.1. Pro: If laws were always moral, there wouldn't be any reason to ask for a change in the law.
1.10.6.1.6. Con: While fetuses may not be considered people, the law has still given them rights in certain situations.
1.10.6.1.6.1. Pro: If an embryo in the uterus is not a human being and someone punches a woman in the stomach and she has a miscarriage they can only be charged with the simple assault of punching her in the stomach.
1.10.6.1.6.2. Pro: Some states have held women [criminally liable](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fetal+Rights) for using illegal drugs that harm the fetus, therefore recognising that the fetus does have some right to not be harmed.
1.10.6.1.6.3. Pro: [Fetal protection policies](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fetal+Rights) were used to bar women from working in roles that could cause harm to embryos or fetuses.
1.10.6.1.6.3.1. Con: The [US Supreme Court](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fetal+Rights) determined that such policies were a form of sexual discrimination which violated the Civil Rights Act.
1.10.6.1.6.4. Pro: The [Unborn Victims of Violence Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unborn_Victims_of_Violence_Act) recognises fetuses as legal victims if they are injured or killed as the result of a federal crime of violence.
1.10.6.1.7. Pro: Numerous attempts have been made to pass [personhood laws](https://rewire.news/legislative-tracker/law-topic/personhood/) in the US, which would classify zygotes, embryos and fetuses as persons, but such attempts have had little success.
1.10.6.1.7.1. Pro: If even the cells and ingredients of a pregnancy were given personhood, then every masturbation would be genocide.
1.10.6.1.7.1.1. Con: There is no scientific basis to give personhood to the gametes of any of the two sexes. Neither of them is a totipotent cell, with the potentiality to become human beings on their own.
1.10.6.1.7.2. Con: That they have had little success doesn't mean that they are wrong.
1.11. Con: Life begins at conception. Abortion therefore violates the right to life of the fetus.
1.11.1. Con: The same way an egg is not a new-born chicken, a fetus can't be considered a human life. Humans are the only species with the right to life: the fetus is more an object of right than a subject of right. Therefore, it is the decision of the owner \[the mother in this case\] what happens with the object.
1.11.1.1. Con: Most people are comfortable killing chickens. The analogy, therefore, falls apart at the point where its not as if people are comfortable killing one but not the other.
1.11.1.2. Con: [A human life begins at conception](https://www.kialo.com/should-women-have-the-right-to-choose-abortion-5637/5637.0=5637.1-5637.2+5637.371). A gallus gallus domesticus \(chicken\) living organism begins at the fertilization of the egg. Both start out as embryos.

The infant stage of a human being begins at birth. The chick stage of a chicken begins after hatching. Eventually the human will reach the adult stage if it doesn't die, and the chick will reach the adult chicken stage as a hen or rooster.

There are many stages of development, but it is the same living organism from conception until death.
1.11.1.3. Con: In cases where a guardian is appointed to decide what happens to another human, such as in cases of small children or the elderly with medical issues, the societal hope is that the  guardian will decide in the best interests of the other human, not act out of self-concern.
1.11.1.4. Con: A chicken egg is analogous to a human woman's unfertilized egg. There is little debate that neither constitutes a person. A more apt argument would reference a fertilized chicken egg, relating it to a chicken, and not referencing the stages of gestation process.
1.11.1.5. Con: A baby is not an adult neither. Following this argument, it could be concluded that adults are subjects of right while babies are objects of right owned by their parents. Perceived differences between a fetus and a baby \(or a baby and an adult\) should not be the criteria to decide which one is object of right and which one is subject of right.
1.11.1.5.1. Pro: Such logic would make infanticide legal and morally acceptable.
1.11.2. Con: While life arguably begins at conception, "life" is technically present in insects and bacteria, both of which we kill billions of every day without any moral dilemma. What makes the life of humans and some animals different is consciousness, and fetuses don't have the structures which science sees as responsible for consciousness.
1.11.2.1. Con: Infants don't begin to show signs of consciousness until [about 5 months](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/04/when-does-your-baby-become-conscious), and aren't considered to be conscious in the same manner as adults are. As such, the scientific determination of lack of consciousness can't be a valid reason to terminate a human life.
1.11.2.1.1. Con: The issue is not that lack of consciousness is a reason to destroy something, but that the cost of destroying something that lacks a consciousness is not a reason to injure someone who has one.
1.11.2.1.2. Pro: Infanticide \(including of prematurely-born viable babies\) is illegal in almost all jurisdictions \(including the entirety of the USA and EU\) and a late-term fetus is negligibly different than a newborn infant. A society’s law should be philosophically consistent.
1.11.2.1.3. Pro: Insofar as morality may be inferred from longstanding and near-universal consensus, the fact that infanticide \(from birth\) is both illegal and abhorred almost everywhere is evidence that it is immoral to kill humans even at ages younger than the supposed “consciousness” milestone referenced here.
1.11.2.2. Con: Many animals are [conscious in a similar manner to humans,](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201208/scientists-conclude-nonhuman-animals-are-conscious-beings) yet are sometimes killed for food for humans. They also may kill other animals. Consciousness, then, is not a good deciding factor for who or what may be killled.
1.11.2.2.1. Con: The fact that those things do happen does not mean that they ought to happen.
1.11.2.2.1.1. Con: The majority of all human societies on Earth throughout recorded history have been primarily omnivores and not vegetarian or vegan. This does indicate that the killing of animals for food is not ethically wrong, and is not considered morally wrong by the vast majority of humans.
1.11.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Society seems to be moving in the direction of trying to avoid animal cruelty and reduce harm done to animals, with an increasing population wanting not to hurt them at all. This indicates that hurting or killing animals is considered morally wrong to the extent that there must be at least some utility gained from doing it.
1.11.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: In countries like the U.S., most claimed vegetarians  [actually eat meat](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animals-and-us/201109/why-are-there-so-few-vegetarians).
1.11.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The nutrients and pleasure gained by eating meat represent a utility gain, and thus do not contradict the claim that animals are considered to have nonzero value.
1.11.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: A [survey of Americans](http://www.aspca.org/sites/default/files/public_memo_aspca_farm_animal_research_ag_gag.pdf) found that the majority support investigating farms to expose animal abuse.
1.11.2.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: [A Canadian poll conducted by Mercy for Animals](http://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/majority-of-canadians-oppose-animal-cruelty-would-pay-more-at-the-grocery-store-to-ensure-welfare) shows that 86% say they would be willing to pay more for chicken meat if it meant that chickens would be treated humanely.
1.11.2.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Whether or not they would support more humane treatment of the chicken in life, note that they still support the chicken being killed and eaten. This, then, is not a support for consciousness being the deciding factor in what a human may choose to kill or not.
1.11.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: In 2010 the world's population was 6.9 billion and the estimated number of vegetarians by choice, not necessity, was 75 million. That's 1.09% of the world's population that believes it is morally wrong to eat meat.
1.11.2.2.2. Con: That conscious beings are considered unimportant \(or less important than people are\) does not imply that non-conscious objects are as important as people are. One could hold that having a consciousness is a requirement for having intrinsic value but that some animals/humans/AIs have more value than others.
1.11.2.3. Con: Recent evidence supports the theory that [insects are conscious.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/insects-are-conscious-claims-major-paper-that-could-show-us-how-our-own-thoughts-began-a7002151.html)
1.11.2.4. Pro: If we include the ability to experience happiness and suffering in the concept of "being conscious", then the argument is valid. Science understands that at least some degree of complexity \(e.g. neurological networks\) is required for this. An early-stage fetus without the necessary bodily systems cannot experience such things. In that sense, an early-stage fetus is not conscious - just like bacteria aren't.
1.11.2.4.1. Con: Unlike bacteria, fetuses have the potential for consciousness. In our decisions about terminating life we should consider 'prospective consciousness' as much as existing consciousness, as having moral value.
1.11.2.4.1.1. Con: Science has not found conclusively that bacteria are not conscious, and evidence points to [the possibility that they are.](http://www.biowars.com/blog/are-bacteria-conscious-beings/)
1.11.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.12.6.
1.11.2.6. Con: Particularly in the U.S. Constitution, human rights are considered "inherent," rather than dependant on traits or values. See the Declaration of Independence: "all men are created equal" and "inalienable rights" are operant phrases in defining why we have rights. A fetus may not be conscious or have the ability to make moral decisions, but this does not negate the fact that it is alive and human.
1.11.2.6.1. Con: In the constitution, these rights are innumerated. Among them, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Allowing government to make this choice for an individual is both a violation of one’s liberty and their pursuit of happiness. In certain medical scenarios, the life of the mother may be at stake, and an abortion ban would violate her right to life, as well.
1.11.2.6.1.1. Con: The Declaration of Independence, not the Constitution states that natural law gives us the right to life. The Constitution doesn't cover right to life, generally, only in specific, limited instances, so there is not a Constitutional guarantee of right to life.
1.11.2.6.1.2. Pro: Forced Birthing Demanders normalize violence against women. For a democratic society where we are all entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness women must be honored and respected as the Life Givers not as the Life Bearers without personal agency. Women have used abortificants for thousands of years. They have the fundamental human right to object to any set of cells growing in their body.
1.11.2.6.2. Con: The U.S. Constitution is irrelevant here. It applies only to people with rights; whether a fetus belongs to that group is at question in this thread.
1.11.2.6.2.1. Con: The Constitution is irrelevant but not for the reason stated. It's irrelevant because all people have rights whether the Constitution acknowledges them or not.  That's the definition of "inalienable rights." Therefore, the phrase "people with rights" is redundant. It's just "people".  Whether a fetus is "people" is at question in this thread.
1.11.2.7. Con: Comparing a fetus to any other life form is useless because it is widely accepted that it is okay to kill animals and insects. Abortion is immoral because this is human life we are considering and the belief that human life is worth defending and honoring is an integral part of our western civilization.
1.11.2.7.1. Con: It is not widely accepted, but rather a dividing factor, that the life of a fetus is equal to the life of a born human. It is not culturally set in stone that the life of a fetus should be defended and honored to the same degree. The comparison to other life forms is therefore not a useless one to make since it points out that there is nothing morally wrong in itself to valuing various forms of life differently.
1.11.2.8. Pro: A single zygote can split into two or more zygotes. Humans cannot split into two or more humans. Similarly, two zygotes can fuse together to become one zygote. Two humans cannot fuse together to become one human. Zygote life is profoundly different from human life.
1.11.2.9. Con: [Article 3](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not apply to insects and bacteria. It also makes no requirement of the conscious state of a human, otherwise we could legally kill anyone in a coma.
1.11.2.9.1. Con: People in a coma once had consciousness, while zygotes never did.
1.11.2.10. Con: However, science is conflicted about when a fetus develops consciousness. They have all the needed traits [for consciousness](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002398.htm) \(a brain, nervous system etc\) by 16 weeks and are also known to experience sounds.
1.11.2.11. Con: The above suggestion makes an unqualified assertion that consciousness, or sentience, or any other capability of brain function for that matter, is what gives an organism's life meaning and significance. The pros need to offer a reason for why life should not be respected in and of itself.
1.11.2.12. Con: -> See 1.11.2.4.1.1.
1.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.6.1.3.9.
1.11.4. Con: -> See 1.10.6.1.3.
1.11.5. Pro: Human life is extremely valuable and therefore should be protected from the moment it begins.
1.11.5.1. Pro: No civilized society permits one human to intentionally harm or take the life of another human without punishment, and abortion is no different.
1.11.5.1.1. Con: Most countries have an army, including civilized ones. Citizens in the army that kill others in the line of army duties are not punished.
1.11.5.1.1.1. Con: The purpose of the military is generally to protect life, and service in the Military is a choice. Abortion does not compare to military, as the fetus is incapable of consenting to self-sacrifice, and in the overwhelming majority of cases there is no life being protected.
1.11.5.1.2. Con: This is not true. Many societies permit humans to end the life of another. For example, euthanasia is legal in many states. Similarly, doctors are often permitted to end the lives of patients who are on life support.
1.11.5.1.2.1. Con: Nazi Germany was one such society. Their euthanasia program targeted mentally and physically disabled patients living in institutional settings and predated the Holocaust by approximately two years. It aimed to eliminate what eugenicists and their supporters considered "life unworthy of life".
1.11.5.1.2.1.1. Con: The fact that euthanasia has been used by dictators in problematic ways does not undermine the fact that there are a number of states and countries that now have legal euthanasia which many people consider to be legitimate.
1.11.5.1.2.1.2. Pro: This was legal and considered to be perfectly legitimate by many people and a good solution to what they considered to be a problem.
1.11.5.1.2.2. Con: Euthanasia and patients on life support are only killed when there is next to zero chance that the person will survive, and are still outlawed in many countries because there is still great debate on whether or not they are considered ethical. By contrast, unborn children have a near certain chance of survival with modern technology.
1.11.5.1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.10.6.1.3.1.1.1.
1.11.5.1.3. Pro: There cannot be any dispute whatsoever that the fetus that a human woman is pregnant with is a human also, and a member of the human species is defined as a human being. Regardless of a "persons" \(a human and an individual\) age they are still of the human species and biologically different and unique from the mother and have life, these are scientific proven facts.
1.11.5.1.3.1. Con: The single aspect undisputed is only that during pregnancy a "human infant" is developing inside a woman's womb. The neural tube doesn't even start developing for the first six [weeks](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/pregnancy-month-by-month/what-happens-second-month-pregnancy). The definition of life is heavily disputed, but if you're using the direct [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/life), an infant in the womb could only be considered living at [18 weeks](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/when-can-a-fetus-hear#1) old as that is when the first sense allows them to be the bare minimum responsive.
1.11.5.1.4. Pro: At [least 38 US states have fetal homicide statutes](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/fetal-homicide-state-laws.aspx). If it is illegal to cause the death of the baby in utero for someone other than the mother, then it follows that it should be illegal for the mother as well.
1.11.5.1.4.1. Con: The current laws of states are irrelevant; this discussion aims to decide whether those laws are ethical.
1.11.5.1.5. Con: Taking life for self-preservation and self-defense are permissible in many civilized societies. The woman who becomes pregnant is required to sacrifice her own nutrition, energy, and bodily space for the growth and existence of a fetus, which could put her own life and well-being at risk. Therefore the woman may choose to preserve herself and not make that sacrifice.
1.11.5.2. Pro: If people view children's death due to illness, accident, or them being killed as a tragedy, it shouldn't be different when a child's life is lost through abortion.
1.11.5.3. Pro: The moral justification for abortion is not compatible with the intrinsic value of human life. It is widely accepted human life post-birth is of immense intrinsic value, and yet before birth this is less so. It is hard to identify an objective difference between born and in-born babies that provides a satisfying justification for this distinction.
1.11.5.3.1. Con: Even under optimal circumstances there is a high rate of miscarriage, which is not morally equivalent to killing. Unborn babies are a potential life, with a nonzero chance of not living when born.
1.11.5.4. Pro: The question of allowing abortion isn't merely a question of destroying lives that already exist. It's about the worth of bringing a human life into existence. Bringing a human life into existence is worth the cost: from the loss of comfort, to the loss of our dreams, even to the loss of our lives. To accept abortion as a valid option is to accept that these things are more valuable than the creation of human life itself.
1.11.5.4.1. Con: The net effect of abortion may increase the number of human lives. Women can have more babies later, making the choice of abortion about whether to have a child now or the future, not a choice between life and no life.
1.11.5.4.2. Con: Circumstances matter. If child is to be introduced to a world where its early years might be severely negatively affected due to various circumstances \(which are often priors for the act of abortion\), then not only does the quality of life of that child suffer, but [as shown by numerous factors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2708328/), humans brought up in bad environments are much more likely to have negative societal impact. The claim about the "worth" of a human life cannot be generalized.
1.11.5.5. Con: People hold different views about when the right to life begins. As such, abortion should remain a personal choice but be accessible to those who wish to access it.
1.11.5.5.1. Con: Years ago, people held different views about whether persons of color and women were people. As such, it follows from your argument that slavery and sexual slavery should have remained a personal choice but be accessible to those who wish to access it. Precautionary principle indicates that if something might harm human lives, then it should be avoided unless certain that it does not harm any human life.
1.11.5.5.2. Pro: There can never be consensus on life being sacred or not from the moment of conception. So what are legislators to do? We can be as polite as we can to the pro life viewpoint but if the achievement of banning abortion is what happens after a political campaign you have one group in society exercising power another group. Better for the state to back off. Let people who disagree with abortion teach their own followers their values and leave it at that.
1.11.5.5.3. Pro: If a gestating human holds the view that life begins at conception, and the mother holds the view that life begins some other time and aborts the gestating human, the human’s rights have been infringed in the eyes of them, but not in the eyes of the mother. This raises a confusing paradox. As such, it’s most likely the case that personal preference has little bearing when deciding whether a gestating human lives or dies.
1.11.5.5.3.1. Con: If one mother holds the view that her life is of value but another mother holds the view that the 1st mother's life isn't worth living and kills her, the 1st mother's rights have been infringed in the eyes of them but not in the eyes of the 2nd mother. This would not be considered a confusing paradox. As such, it is the case that personal preference has no legal baring in deciding whether one human lives or dies.
1.11.5.5.4. Con: Two hunters may have differing views of whether a movement in the bushes is a deer or another hunter. The right course of action in that case as well as this one is to determine with certainty if the target is or is not a person deserving the right to life before taking that life away.
1.11.5.5.5. Pro: Not everyone who gets pregnant will choose an abortion. The question is about control--just because some don't get abortions doesn't mean that nobody should be allowed to. Just because some do get abortions doesn't mean that everyone should have to.
1.11.5.5.6. Pro: The question of the right to choose is a moral/ethical question, not a question of law. Thus, whether or not one believes morally or ethically that a woman should abort a child, ultimately the decision is tested by the moral and ethical beliefs of said woman. The law cannot dictate individual morals and ethics, and thus cannot stand in the way of the right to choose.
1.11.5.5.7. Pro: By making abortion legal, then both pro-life and pro-choice positions are supported. Each person will have the freedom to decide according to their own beliefs. Laws, at least in a secular democracy like United States, should consider the rights of all people. Making it legal respects both sides.
1.11.5.5.8. Con: Choosing is a mental process, not a right. Every human that can think has the ability to choose anything always. No one has the right to choose anything always, because there is no such thing as a right to choose anything always.[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGsrrR9uCbE)
1.11.5.5.9. Pro: Many scientists would state that they still [do not know](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2017/04/when_does_life_begin_outside_the_christian_right_the_answer_is_over_time.html) when life begins, as there are many landmark moments such as the development of the spine and brain. As a result, it could be seen that a fetus goes on a gradual process to personhood.
1.11.5.5.9.1. Con: Even if a fetus is only potential for human life, it still has [value.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48PMlt2vTRA)
1.11.5.5.10. Con: Scientific literature is [conclusive](https://www.princeton.edu/~prolife/articles/embryoquotes2.html) on the "humanness" of an unborn human fetus at the moment of conception.
1.11.5.5.10.1. Pro: Genetically it is identical from the moment of conception, biologically it is only in an earlier stage of development.
1.11.5.5.10.2. Con: -> See 1.11.5.5.9.
1.11.5.5.10.3. Con: "Human" in scientific terms refers to the species of embryo, and is not markedly different from using the term to define the species of sperm, oocyte, stem cell, DNA sample, tissue sample, organ, etc. Fetus refers to the growing organism after approximately 8 weeks. Prior to 8 weeks, the proper terms are zygote, blastula, and embryo.
1.11.5.5.10.3.1. Con: It is markedly different. While one can say human sperm to describe sperm, no one can correctly say the sperm is a human. The sperm has only half the genetic information needed to be considered human. You can say human zygote to describe zygote but also could call the zygote a human in its earliest stage of development. It has all the genetic information and is following it, beginning to grow. All that is necessary for life. A DNA sample and the other examples also don't grow and develop.
1.11.5.5.10.4. Con: Skin cells and fertilized human egg cells are equally "human", yet no one mourns dead skin cells. The issue is "personhood", not the species or DNA of the cells involved.
1.11.5.5.10.4.1. Con: A skin cell is not a person and will never develop into one. A fertilized human egg, most of the time, will develop consciousness and self-awareness if it is not aborted. Further, consciousness and self-awareness comes about [earlier](https://neurologicalreorganization.org/brain-research/are-unborn-babies-aware/) than previously thought.
1.11.5.5.10.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.
1.11.5.5.10.5. Con: Most of these sources merely define medical terms and confirm that a fertilized embryo is genetically human. They do not address the question of defining a precise moment when the new organism should acquire legal rights independent of its mother's.
1.11.5.6. Con: You're making a claim that you do not and can not substantiate. There is no support for the conclusion that human life is so valuable.
1.11.6. Con: -> See 1.11.5.5.
1.11.7. Pro: The US government has a constitutional obligation to protect the lives and liberties of it's citizens. A fetus' heart can be heard within the first month, therefore those constitutional rights should be afforded to that individual.
1.11.7.1. Con: The right to life is not absolute.
1.11.7.1.1. Pro: All rights require the consent of a society to be applied/protected and there is no consensus in society on this issue.
1.11.7.1.1.1. Con: Many rights are intrinsic to every individual human and require absolutely no societal agreement.
1.11.7.1.1.2. Con: Basic individual rights, such as the right to life, exist independent of popular opinion and should never be subject to a public vote. The only issue society can decide is whether or not it will respect and protect those rights.
1.11.7.1.2. Con: The only exceptions to the universality of the right to life are those in which the person to be killed has committed some wrong, either to his own nation or to another. A baby has done no moral wrong worthy of punishment by death.
1.11.7.1.2.1. Con: There are many cases in which people who have done no wrong are denied a right to life. The court's interpretation of the [4th Amendment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), since [Graham v. Connor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_v._Connor#), and the [Stand-your-ground laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-your-ground_law) enacted in many states, both justify the use of lethal force in the event someone feels threatened—even if they aren't actually being threatened and/or they caused the situation that made them feel threatened in the first place. The victims of this force are innocent, but society condones their killing.
1.11.7.1.2.1.1. Con: These "victims" are not always innocent. In the context of the original argument, a baby/fetus usually does not present a legitimate threat to the life of the mother. When it does, possible exceptions can be considered.
1.11.7.1.3. Pro: Murder is not always unethical. Murder in times of war is considered lawful, and soldiers who commit such acts cannot be prosecuted. Abortion is arguably an act of self-defense on the part of the woman, and is therefore analogous to the acts of soldiers in wartime.
1.11.7.1.3.1. Con: If a military member violates any of the governing laws of war, laws of armed conflict, rules of engagement, or escalation of force then they should be prosecuted for murder. Police departments have a homicide investigative detail to ascertain whether a homicide is a crime i.e. manslaughter or murder. Separation of homicide, which is not a crime, and murder, which is, is very important in this case.
1.11.7.1.3.2. Con: This argument still does not justify abortion, it only says that one would be philosophically inconsistent to believe abortion were wrong but war were okay. That does not answer the question of whether or not abortion is justified.
1.11.7.1.3.3. Con: Many anti-abortion advocates are also anti-war. Most Americans would justify military action only in self-defense, while 99% of aborted children pose no threat to their mothers.
1.11.7.1.3.4. Con: We do not allow a free pass for soldiers to kill innocents. There are many examples of soldiers being convicted of war crimes for such acts, In most societies, soldiers act under strict rules of engagement designed to protect innocents, non-combatants and combatants who are wounded or captured.
1.11.7.1.3.5. Con: The adjective 'murder' does not apply to official combatants killing opposing soldiers in wartime. To be classified as murder, there needs to be [prior intention to kill one specific victim](http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/homicide-definition.html), and [no legal excuse or authority.](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/murder)
1.11.7.1.3.5.1. Con: Then abortion is not murder if there is no malicious intent and it is predominantly legal.
1.11.7.1.3.5.1.1. Con: The definition of malice aforethought is prior intention to kill one \(or more\) specific victims. E.G. to kill Joe, not to kill a random enemy soldier. Abortion \(save pills taken when not sure if one is with child or not\) has the goal of terminating one specific victim.
1.11.7.1.3.5.1.1.1. Con: By this definition, targeting a high-ranking officer of an enemy during wartime would be murder.
1.11.7.1.3.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Assassination is generally considered [a type of murder](http://www.differencebetween.info/difference-between-murder-and-assassination) with a political motivation. It is "[murder](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/assassination) committed by a perpetrator without the personal provocation of the victim."
1.11.7.1.3.5.1.1.1.2. Con: That assassination is a form of murder because it targets a specific person would support the point that abortion is murder because it targets a specific person - not oppose the point.
1.11.7.1.3.5.1.2. Con: A 'legal excuse or authority' to justify a killing would be self defense in view of an immediate violent threat, or other [justifiable homicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justifiable_homicide), or due process in a court of law such as a judge sentencing a criminal to death.
1.11.7.1.3.5.2. Con: Even the source referenced affirms that prior mens rea, \(pre-meditation and guilty-mind\), is not a necessary requirement to be guilty of murder.  Only the "first degree" of murder, according to this definition, requires pre-meditation, which is likely not universal among all societies.
1.11.7.1.3.6. Pro: Murder is acceptable when one is defending oneself and one's autonomy. Soldiers must kill or else they will captured, injured or killed by the enemy. Likewise, mothers who bear unwanted children lose their bodily autonomy, freedom, and sometimes their health.
1.11.7.1.3.6.1. Con: That comparison only works in cases of rape and when the woman's life is in risk. Presence of someone unwanted isn't the same as occupation. If that were the case, you should be allowed to kill a born unwanted child regardless of its age as raising a child make you lose the same qualities.
1.11.7.1.3.6.1.1. Con: You might lose some of those qualities but not all. The deciding factor is the possibility of your death, which isn't given post birth.
1.11.7.1.3.6.2. Con: Serving as the caregiver to a spouse with Alzheimer's also threatens one's health and freedom, yet killing one's spouse in order to restore one's freedom or protect one's health is considered murder.
1.11.7.1.3.6.2.1. Con: The above claim is logically irrelevant. The spouse does not live inside the body of the caregiver in this example, and technically the caregiver can simply walk away \(though the morality of that would be a separate argument entirely\).
1.11.7.1.3.7. Con: The killing that soldiers do is a necessity for the survival of the state during a time of war. It is killing to protect life, which is a necessary prerequisite for all other rights. Abortion has no such necessity.
1.11.7.1.3.7.1. Con: In most wars, the goal is not to kill the enemy population, but to take control of it. As such, the soldier is not really protecting life, he's just protecting the government of said life.
1.11.7.1.4. Pro: Governments do not do everything they can to ensure that people remain alive for as long as possible, which they should if the right to life is absolute and fundamental.
1.11.7.1.4.1. Pro: Governments do not put all of their money into healthcare and medical research to allow people to live as long as possible.
1.11.7.1.4.2. Pro: Governments do not make it a requirement of people to donate organs even though this would mean being able to save many people's lives.
1.11.7.1.4.3. Pro: There is an action/inaction distinction, such that consequences can be morally reprehensible if they come from inaction. Yet, the government chooses to spend money on things other than charity.
1.11.7.1.4.4. Con: The 'right to life' is not the same as 'the right to be kept alive for as long as possible'. It only means that a human has the right to live, and should not be killed by another human being.
1.11.7.1.5. Pro: Capital punishment is still [legal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_country) in a number of countries, and in a number of US states. This shows that at times the state condones the ending of life, meaning the right is not absolute.
1.11.7.1.5.1. Con: The removal of rights after due process is never the case with abortion. The gestating human has either done nothing to warrant the removal of their rights, or does not even possess such rights. Capital punishment has no bearing on the abortion discussion.
1.11.7.1.5.2. Con: Capital punishment is a penalty meant for someone who committed serious crimes. The fetus' life should not be terminated since he/she did not commit any crime.
1.11.7.1.5.3. Con: Capital punishment is a specific circumstance where people have committed a heinous crime and therefore have a number of their rights restricted or taken away.
1.11.7.1.5.4. Con: Capital punishment is an act of self-defense, imparted only by the State, and is an act of last resort, i.e. the prisoner is still a danger to society. It is not a statement on the value or right to life of the one being executed.
1.11.7.1.5.4.1. Pro: Capital punishment protects the right to life by establishing consequences for murderers.
1.11.7.1.6. Pro: A few countries and US states have now [legalised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_euthanasia) euthanasia, which allows people the ability to determine that they wish to end their lives and this action is condoned by the government.
1.11.7.1.6.1. Con: Choosing euthanasia ends only the choosers life. Choosing an abortion ends only the life of the child, not the person doing the choosing.
1.11.7.1.6.1.1. Con: In case of [non-voluntary euthanasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-voluntary_euthanasia) the decision to end a life is taken by a family member or the doctor.
1.11.7.1.6.1.1.1. Con: Non-voluntary euthanasia takes into account the wishes of the patient. From the link, NVE is “based on what the incapacitated individual would have wanted if they could be asked.” Abortion does not necessarily take this concern into account, and is a separate issue from euthanasia.
1.11.7.1.6.1.1.2. Con: These cases usually occur when a patient is at the end of its life. A fetus/baby would typically be at the beginning of its life.
1.11.7.1.6.1.2. Pro: A baby/fetus cannot legitimately express a desire to be aborted. If it could, it is unlikely that a fetus would reject its own life.
1.11.7.1.6.2. Con: Although the ethics of this is still under much debate, this has no bearing on the abortion argument because abortion is not consensual for the child.
1.11.7.1.6.2.1. Con: That is because unborn children are not capable of giving consent. Even in cases when the explicit consent of the individual concerned is unavailable, such as when the person is in a persistent vegetative state, or in the case of young children, [non-voluntary euthanasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-voluntary_euthanasia) can be conducted.
1.11.7.1.7. Con: The right to life is enshrined in [Article 3](http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/udhr_article_3.html) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
1.11.7.1.7.1. Con: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not a legally binding instrument.
1.11.7.1.7.1.1. Con: The legal ramifications of a document have no bearing on the moral applicability of its implications.
1.11.7.1.7.2. Con: The fact that the right to life is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \(UDHR\) doesn't make the right to life absolute. The UDHR says nothing about the right to life of animals or \(hypothetical\) aliens. The first article makes it clear that such rights [begin at birth.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/S0968-8080%2805%2926218-3)
1.11.7.1.8. Con: All other human rights depend on life.
1.11.7.1.9. Pro: The right to life can trade off with other rights. We generally defer to the right to life, but not always when the harms of preserving life are massive.
1.11.7.1.9.1. Con: Unless the consequences of birth is possible fatal harm to the mother, preserving the life of yet-unborn children does not cause massive harm.
1.11.7.2. Con: The established test is the survivability of the foetus autonomously from the parent's body. This is not possible within 1st trimester. Heart beating doesn't warrant survival outside of uterus.
1.11.7.3. Pro: The Roe v. Wade decision ruled abortion legal under ["right to privacy"](https://nwlc.org/resources/roe-v-wade-and-right-abortion/) language in the constitution, and ignored the government's obligation defend it's citizens.
1.11.8. Pro: Abortion is invariably murder. To support abortion as a whole while holding any other belief which treats human life as valuable is directly contradictory.
1.11.8.1. Con: Many countries and their citizens are living their life despite this alleged contradiction indicating that this isn't a direct contradiction but rather a cultural norm.
1.11.8.2. Con: Some beliefs in our current society benefit the life of one human being while taking the life of another.
1.11.8.2.1. Pro: An example of this is taking the life of another in self defense.
1.11.8.3. Con: Looking at abortion as killing is a legitimate point. A pregnant woman however, under carefully considered circumstances and limitations, may have the right to kill. This would make it something else than murder, in the same way that capital punishment isn't murder.
1.11.8.3.1. Con: Following this logic, a woman having given birth to a child, realizing how much work, money and time goes into taking care of it, could have the right to kill this child. Capital punishment cannot be compared to abortion, unless you also accept the premise that you could kill the child after birth.
1.11.8.4. Con: To murder is to take the life of another human being. While zygotes, embreyos and fetuses are stages of human development, they are not yet autonomous human beings. They do not have human faculties and the termination of their development is not homicide.
1.11.9. Pro: Life must be defined to exist right after conception. Otherwise, if a woman drinks to the point of intoxication while the child is in womb she can be charged with nothing because there's no one's life she could possibly be violating.
1.11.10. Pro: If a child in the womb won't be considered a human being, it would lead to a conclusion there should be no prenatal care offered because there's no value in offering prenatal care to a non-human entity.
1.11.10.1. Con: Whether or not the child is considered a human or not is often decided by the mother, based on whether or not the pregnancy is wanted. Just because some women do not want to carry a pregnancy to term is not a pathway to concluding that there should be no prenatal care offered.
1.11.10.2. Con: A fetus does not need to be considered a child in order for it's care to be valued. Women who want children will want those children to be healthy. We know that caring for a fetus will help it develop into a healthy child. Doctors, parents and society as a whole are not likely to forget the value of fetal care simply because we know that a developing fetus is not yet a child.
1.11.10.3. Con: A child in the womb isn't currently considered a human being and it has not lead to a conclusion that there should be no prenatal care.
1.11.11. Con: -> See 1.10.6.1.
1.11.12. Pro: Biological facts indicate that fetuses are human.
1.11.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.7.1.1.
1.11.12.2. Pro: Human development is a continuum. From fertilized egg to old age, going through embryo, fetus, baby, toddler, adolescent, adult. At no point there is a discontinuity, therefore the only plausible beginning of human personhood is during fertilization.
1.11.12.2.1. Con: There is no discontinuity in human development between adolescence and adulthood, yet we still recognize them as distinct phases of life. There's no rule saying a phase change requires a discontinuity.
1.11.12.2.1.1. Con: It is recognized that embryo, fetus and child are distinct phases of life, exactly like adolescence and adulthood are. The point is that human life is equaly valuable in all of its phases; old age, adulthood, adolescence, childhood, newborn, fetus, embryo.
1.11.12.2.2. Con: There is a discontinuity. At first the fetus is unable to survive on its own outside the body of the mother. Then at some point the baby is able to survive on its own.
1.11.12.2.2.1. Con: It is not entirely clear at what stage during the pregnancy this occurs, making it difficult to draw a line about when abortion would and would not be acceptable based on this.
1.11.12.2.2.2. Con: 'At some point' is not a true discontinuity anymore than a bird flying at some point or a joey leaving the pouch at some point is. It is just a mark of growth, not a discontinuous stage like a larva or chrysalis would be.
1.11.12.2.2.3. Con: That someone cannot survive on their own if ejected from their current environment is not a logical justification for deliberately terminating that life.
1.11.12.2.3. Pro: The argument that a fetus is not a human requires the assumption that the fetus does not develop further. This is obviously untrue as when left alone, fetuses do develop into infants.
1.11.12.2.4. Con: This continuity begins with sperm and egg, which would make masturbation similar to abortion.
1.11.12.2.4.1. Con: Masturbation generally does not include both eggs and sperms present simultaneously, and by most definitions does not include fertilization. There is a distinct beginning of continuity with fertilization.
1.11.12.2.4.2. Con: Continuity doesn't begin with sperm and egg, since neither of them autonomously directs their own development. On their own, sperm and egg will not develop any further. They are part of an already existing human being, similar to other cells in human body. 
Unlike the embryo which autonomously directs its own development and has a distinct and unique DNA which differentiates it from both parents.
1.11.12.3. Pro: Human embryos autonomously [direct their own development](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb3347) after conception, even when they are not in their mothers’ wombs.
1.11.12.3.1. Con: An embryo's development cannot occur for extended periods ex vivo. Therefore, the embryo depends on the woman's uterus.
1.11.12.3.2. Con: This is not enough to define embryos as complete humans worthy of every human right.
1.11.12.3.3. Con: "Autonomously" is the wrong word. It implies intent and cognition. My bowels do not autonomously eliminate waste. My heart does not autonomously pump blood. These are biological functions, quite apart from thought or intention. It is the same with gestation.
1.11.12.4. Pro: After 20 days of fetal development, the fetus develops a heartbeat, and because a heartbeat is an indication of life, the fetus should get legal protections as it is human and has the right to life.
1.11.12.4.1. Con: In general, humans are totally comfortable killing animals with a heartbeat for food. It is unclear why this is a meaningful bright line.
1.11.12.4.1.1. Con: We're discussing a human life, not an animal one. Most people would consider them to be very different.
1.11.12.4.2. Con: A heartbeat is a mechanical function like any other. Machines can be designed with systems which are analogous to heartbeats. The heartbeat is "an indication of life" insofar as a person without a heartbeat is generally either dead or likely to die imminently, not such that an object having a "heartbeat" makes it a living being.
1.11.12.4.3. Con: A heartbeat is not enough to define life. The neural system is far more relevant to draw a line between an alive and conscious human and a bunch of worthless cells.
1.11.12.4.3.1. Con: Given scientists and philosophers haven't reached a consensus on the difference between a human and a fetus in terms of the brain, using the brain as the sole criteria is an unnecessary ethical risk.
1.11.12.4.3.2. Con: Brain and heart activity are "life signs" as they are convenient indicators of when an individual is alive, but they are not themselves criteria to be alive. In an adult human, we know that if the brain and heart are both active, all cells are working together for the survival of systems as a whole. [This is an important component of cellular organization, a central benchmark of biological life.](https://www2.estrellamountain.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/BioBookCELL2.html) While a fetus doesn't have brain and heart activity, it still has cellular organization.
1.11.12.4.4. Pro: If we claim a person to be dead when their heart stops beating, life should begin when their heart starts beating. Claiming the fetus is not independently survivable at that point doesn't matter. Many people are kept alive by the assistance of machinery and technology.
1.11.12.4.5. Con: It takes [6 weeks](https://www.babycenter.com/404_when-can-i-hear-my-babys-heartbeat_10349811.bc) to hear a babies heart beats. Some sources even say the heart is not made [before](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302) then. Apparently some doctors say it is normal to not find a heart beat until [8-10 weeks](https://www.babycenter.com/400_when-a-doctor-can-find-the-heartbeat-of-a-baby-which-week-wi_8096703_321.bc).
1.11.12.4.6. Con: A heartbeat is one of a few signs that are required to determine whether or not a human is alive. And it is no longer considered a primary sign in modern medicine. [In medicine the determining factor of whether or not a human is dead is brain function.](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-01-10/opinion/ct-death-jahi-brain-legal-perspec-0110-20140110_1_brain-death-brain-trauma-brain-function)A fetal brain does not meet the criteria of functioning for months into the pregnancy.
1.11.12.4.7. Con: We do not consider it murder to "pull the plug" on someone who is brain dead, even if their heart is beating.
1.11.12.4.7.1. Con: Pulling the plug on a brain dead person occurs when medical professionals agree there is very little to no chance at life. This is not always the case for "voluntarily" aborted fetuses.
1.11.12.5. Con: Due to natural forces, human eggs are frequently fertilized without implanting or coming to term after implanting. Attempting to procreate is considered ethical despite the fact that it frequently leads to the destruction of a fertilized egg. It follows that destroying a fertilized egg for the health and well-being of the mother and would-be child is even more important and therefore also ethical.
1.11.12.5.1. Con: It is illogical to use "natural" causes of death as a justification for "unnatural" causes of death. There are two reasons for it: 1\) the two are not the same thing. 2\) natural causes of death are not "good" things and usually no more desirable than unnatural.
1.11.12.5.2. Con: The natural consequence of sexual intercourse is pregnancy, so the parents are simply employing a natural system to it's natural end. The possibility of a failure in the natural process is thus not the fault of the parents, but due to an accident of nature. Nature, unlike a person, is neither conscious of it's actions nor does it have the power to do otherwise, so it can in no way be held responsible for such death. Consequently, nothing immoral happens in the case of death by natural forces.
1.11.13. Pro: As [IVF has demonstrated,](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/embryo-ethics-does-discarding-unused-embryos-constitute-murder) the fertilised egg is capable of existing and surviving outside the womb of its mother and is only in need of nutritional support or a gestational carrier. Thus the handling of fertilised eggs is an ethical problem. This is why the use of embryo's for research is an ethical dilemma if they lead to the destruction of the embryo.
1.11.14. Con: -> See 1.11.7.1.
1.11.15. Con: Even if the fetus is a life, so is the mother. This raises a question about whose rights should be prioritised. It is not clear that the right to life of a fetus necessarily trumps the right to bodily autonomy and self-preservation of the mother.
1.11.15.1. Con: The right to life of one innocent individual trumps the rights of another individual in the exercise of their bodily autonomy or desires of self-preservation to deprive the life of the former. Just as her rights to bodily autonomy and self-preservation do not extend so far as to permit her to exercise those rights to take the life an innocent adult, they do not extend to permit her to take the life of her innocent, unborn child.
1.11.15.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.12.2.4.
1.11.15.1.2. Con: Our right to autonomy and self-preservation actually does extend to the killing of others, otherwise known as the principle of self-defence. If another person was inside you, and you do not want it there, then you should have the right to remove it regardless of the consequences to them.
1.11.15.2. Pro: We should value an established life above potential life and recognize established life's right to choose their desired pursuits that naturally generate well-being.
1.11.15.2.1. Con: This just asserts a fetus is a potential life. By all means, a fetus is already a human life unless evidence of the contrary is provided.
1.11.15.2.1.1. Pro: IVF has demonstrated that the fertilised egg is a human being that is capable of living independent of its parents. It is merely in need of nutrition and a gestational carrier.
1.11.15.3. Con: There is absolutely zero precedent in law for anything other than a clear and imminent threat to life or property to be valued above the right of the other party to live. This has been codified as deadly force statutes defining acceptable justification to defend against charges of homicide. In [Texas law](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.19.htm), the statute defining homicide had to be modified with a specific exemption because an assault on a pregnant woman which causes the death of the fetus can still be considered murder.
1.11.15.3.1. Con: An unwanted fetus inside a woman should be interpreted as an attacker violating the autonomy of the woman's body. People have the right to defend themselves against someone invading their body by the use of force. Even if by mental impairment an attacker is truly not responsible for his/her actions, the victim still has the right to resist her body being invaded.
1.11.15.4. Pro: It is impossible to give a foetus 'equal rights' to the person carrying it. To claim that a foetus has an inviolable right to life is to say that it should be born regardless of circumstances, even if it seriously harms or kills the pregnant person.
1.11.15.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.3.1.1.
1.11.15.4.2. Con: If the unborn child poses a risk to the life of the mother the aim is to deliver the child, not to kill it. This might pose an additional risk to the child if delivered very early but is not an abortion, e.g. aiming to kill the baby.
1.11.15.5. Con: Traditionally, the U.S Supreme Court recognizes the right to protections of life as of higher priority than the rights to liberty. Religion is the ubiquitous example of this, with human sacrifice being an explicit limit to religious freedom.
1.11.15.6. Con: It is likewise not clear that the maternal right to bodily autonomy and self preservation necessarily trumps the fetus' right to life. This is the crux of the entire debate and may be unresolvable.
1.11.15.7. Pro: Seeing a fetus as 'human life' does not imply its right of absolute protection, since there are many situations where human life depends on being sustained by the personal sacrifice \(and not the legal obligation\) of another human being, not only in the case of organ donations, where nobody is ever obliged to share their body to rescue or protect another human life, but also, for example, when you could prevent a lethal accident or drowning with only moderate risk for your own health.
1.11.15.7.1. Con: The woman is not being required to make any sacrifice beyond what was already implicated by her choice that led to the child being inside her in the first place- what is being argued is her option to reneg on her decision and purposefully end the innocent life she put there.
1.11.15.8. Con: The fetus has more value than the mother \(and the father\) because it is of the next generation. It represents the future.
1.11.15.8.1. Con: Imagine an hypothetical case where the parents are 18 years old and their son/daughter has a genetic mutation. This genetic mutation will most probably kill him/her at a very young age. The parents would be "the future" in this case and under your argument they should be allowed to ask for an abortion.
1.11.15.9. Pro: On an airplane using the breathing bag, you are always supposed to put the breathing mask on yourself first, then you should try to put a mask on the child. If it's a choice between saving your life and helping the kid or saving the kid's life with a chance of passing out and leaving both of you dead, you are supposed to choose your own. But you are able to make the choice for yourself. If the woman didn't mean to be pregnant/changed her mind, she should be free to do that.
1.11.15.9.1. Con: This analogy implies that the mother would save herself then save the child. In the case of the abortion, the mother saves herself then lets the child die. This analogy is deeply flawed.
1.11.15.10. Con: The right to life must be the higher one because without it there wouldn't be any rights; society wouldn't be possible. Hence, to protect the overall rights we need to begin by protecting everyone's life, and a fetus is a human life. That's the reason why, when our life is threatened, we can act in legitimate defences against our aggressor. The rights of an individual, as a whole, are not higher/lower because of whose rights they are but because of which right are we protecting.
1.11.15.11. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.5.
1.11.15.12. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.
1.11.15.13. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.5.1.11.3.3.
1.11.15.14. Con: The mother's right to bodily autonomy is less valid in this instance as she made choices which resulted in the existence of the fetus.
1.11.15.14.1. Con: The point of a right is that it is not conditional upon one's choices. People should never lose the right to their bodily autonomy based on their actions in life.
1.11.15.14.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.9.
1.11.15.14.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.11.16. Con: While all the cells of our body are [alive biologically](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life) most of them are not considered a human life and therefore destroying them is not killing. That is why scratching your nose or menstruating \(involving the deaths of millions of cells\) is not considered a crime. Given human life is a subjective concept, to define it at conception \(when it consists of two cells\) is arbitrary.
1.11.16.1. Con: Even when left alone, skin cells and menstrual blood will never become a human baby.
1.11.16.1.1. Con: A fertilized cell if left alone would never become a human being. It needs constant help from the mother and the mother can't be forced to provide this help.
1.11.16.2. Con: Skin cells and blood cells are not living, developing organisms, whereas biology holds that the human organism [begins at conception.](https://www.kialo.com/argument/5637.371) This is not a subjective definition, such as defining what rights or value a life has might be, but is a concrete biological one.
1.11.16.3. Pro: Even if the fetus is considered a biological human being, there is no reasonable social consensus on the morally relevant point in which it is entitled to the protection of its life. As long as such a consensus is not reached, abortions must be a personal decision based on one's belief in this matter.
1.11.16.3.1. Con: If there is no reasonable social consensus, then we should err on the side of caution instead.
1.11.16.3.1.1. Pro: There is certainly no consensus that the fetus is some special class of human that doesn't deserve human rights. A lack of consensus should reflect a lack of action, and people who seek abortions are the first-actors of the situation.
1.11.16.3.2. Pro: The law should not punish an act unless there is no reasonable doubt that a right was infringed upon, therefore, relevant social consensus is essential to define an act as criminal.
1.11.16.3.2.1. Con: There is no reasonable doubt that aborting a human prevents it from exercising any other rights.
1.11.16.3.3. Con: If the fetus is considered a biological human being, the social consensus across the world for generarions informs us that human beings have an irrefutable right to life. Hence a lack of social or moral consensus becomes irrelevant.
1.11.16.4. Con: The whole is more than the sum of its parts. Humans are most certainly more than a collection of nose and reproductive cells \(among others\). Our humanity, therefore, must come from a place other than the definition of our cells.
1.11.16.4.1. Pro: Our humanity comes from a combination of our bodies and our minds or consciousness. Therefore, humanity or human life cannot be present at the time of conception when we have human DNA, but lack both human bodies and human minds.
1.11.16.5. Con: A fetus has a distinct and functional genome denoting it as a different and complete organism.
1.11.16.5.1. Con: Being a distinct organism does not equate to being an autonomous human being.
1.11.16.6. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.4.1.
1.11.16.7. Con: Those two cells are the Genesis of life. They create the entire body and should be thought of as such. They are arguably more important than the billions of cells that make up the entire adult leg for example. One can live without a leg but it’s a serious crime if someone removes another’s leg. That life deserves all the same protections and rights that everyone has, wants and deserves.
1.11.17. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.
1.12. Pro: Access to abortion and control over reproduction is fundamental to achieving gender equality.
1.12.1. Con: Gender equality is predicated on the importance of human life in the first place. Even if this empowers women, if the action is wrong it still ought to be banned.
1.12.2. Pro: Access to reproductive rights are vital for girls and women to lead healthy lives. Poor sexual and reproductive health accounts for 1/3 of global diseases affecting women between 15 and 44 \([Planned Parenthood, p. 6](http://www.ippf.org/sites/default/files/2020_gender_equality_report_web.pdf)\).
1.12.2.1. Con: Access to abortion increases sexual [diseases](https://www.law.upenn.edu/fac/jklick/32JLS407.pdf). The opposite of the above claim is true.
1.12.3. Con: Gender equality and the ending of life are unrelated issues. Neither men nor women have the right to kill a human being.
1.12.3.1. Con: This argument presupposes that unborn fetuses constitute human beings
1.12.3.1.1. Con: If it was not for abortion there would be a human. Abortion causes the human life cycle to cease. That’s the point of abortion, to stop a life from existing after the process to create life has begun.
1.12.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.14.2.
1.12.5. Pro: Women will never be equal to men if they continue to be  punished for being sexual beings. We don’t just have sex for procreation, but for enjoyment. Women are made to feel guilty and are punished for engaging in sex, by a society that forces them to continue with pregnancies they are not equipped for, while the man is championed for having a multiple sexual partners, and can just walk away from responsibility. Accidents happen, but currently only the woman gets punished.
1.12.5.1. Con: Both should be equally responsible. But it doesn't justify taking a life.
1.12.6. Con: Abortion worsens gender inequality.
1.12.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.
1.12.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.10.
1.12.6.3. Pro: Considering this topic regards whether the woman has the right to choose to terminate life, and not whether the father has any say, then support of the woman's right alone to choose is not a step for gender equality, but rather increases gender inequality.
1.12.6.3.1. Pro: Women have substantially more reproductive choice than men do, including pre-intercourse methods such as the Birth Control Sponge, Patch, Vaginal Ring, Pills, Shot, Implant, a diaphragm, an IUD, getting her tubes tied or a hysterectomy, the morning after pill, and giving the baby up for adoption. Men have condoms, or a vasectomy, and zero options after the baby is conceived. Men can not give up responsibility.
1.12.6.3.1.1. Con: In the case of rape women do not have control over their reproductive health without the potentially negative impacts continuous birth control methods offer.
1.12.6.3.1.2. Con: Women may have a surfeit of options, but the most common and convenient form of reproductive control \(condoms\) are highly accessible to both genders.
1.12.6.4. Pro: Abortion makes women available as sex objects by ensuring that men can be sure that they won't have to have any long term consequences of having sex.
1.12.6.4.1. Con: It is not clear that the sexual objectification of women would necessarily be any greater when women have access to abortion than without it if men feel they can simply remove themselves from the situation and avoid responsibility.
1.12.6.4.2. Con: Men can often be made to provide child support such that it may not always be the case that they can simply avoid all long term consequences.
1.12.6.4.3. Con: The height of objectification has already been reached. If women are able to decide not to be just a vessel for a child, then they are no longer held in view as just an object, or a means to an end \(procreation\). Women should be able to be a whole person and choose to have children or not and also choose to have sex or not.
1.12.6.4.4. Con: Abortion does not, however, exist in a vacuum. Other parts of the gender equality movement- indeed, even the one that advocates for making/keeping abortion legal, commit to shifting culture toward the view that women are not inherently sex objects, but rather have their own sexuality to bring to bear.
1.12.6.5. Con: Late undesired pregnancy impedes the woman of performing her professional activities for a considerable period of time, thus, making her dependent on her partner, institutions and her family.
1.12.6.6. Con: Negative attitudes during and towards pregnancy can lead to [postpartum deppression](http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1986-09238-001) which only affects the mother and increases her dependency on others like its partner, family or the state.
1.12.6.7. Con: Men do not have to carry around a big belly or stay in bed for months when they have unplanned or undesired pregnancy. Instead they can walk away and not assume their parental role. Not like the mother has to do when in her middle/late pregnancy. Abortion could be a choice for women to stand in the same ground as men.
1.12.7. Con: Gender equality is about mindset change, not quantity equivalency.
1.12.8. Con: Gender equality is impossible. Men and women are different, and will have different experiences.
1.12.8.1. Con: Men and women will have different experiences, but gender equality can still be achieved if those different experiences are taken into account. Equality does not mean both genders should be treated the same, but it does mean both genders should be treated fairly.
1.12.8.2. Con: Men and women are not different in any way that has any bearing on the argument of equality/equal rights. Equality, in this respect, allows a woman to pursue her aspirations in an equivalent manner to which a man is able to pursue his - and in order to achieve that a woman must have reproductive control, which includes abortion.
1.12.8.2.1. Con: A man, just like a woman can have his aspirations affected by pregnancy. Giving a woman the choice to have an abortion without including the man gives her additional rights. It exalts her above the man and above the baby rather than making them more equal.
1.12.8.3. Con: It is still possible to achieve equality with regards to the rights and treatment that men and women receive, and to ensure that they are not unfairly treated as a result of their gender. This would include rights such as bodily autonomy being awarded to all.
1.12.8.4. Pro: In the cases where there is biological predetermination "gender equality" should only be invoked when talking about events that are normative to both genders. In other words no legal or ethical decision on abortion will achieve "gender equality", until abortion is available to both genders - i.e. when males start conceiving \(and consequently sometimes aborting\) fetuses.
1.12.8.4.1. Con: -> See 1.12.8.3.
1.12.8.4.2. Con: While the biological functions of men and women's bodies might be different, giving men and women equal control over how their bodies are used and treated could still be seen as successfully achieving gender equality.
1.12.9. Pro: If a woman is not allowed to have an abortion, she is not only forced to continue the pregnancy to birth, but also expected by society to support and look after the resulting child for many years to come.
1.12.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.12.9.2. Pro: To criminalize abortion is to punish solely the woman, who is not solely responsible for the conception of the child. In terms of equity, the minimal needed to apply  fairness in a circumstance that implicates the punishment for abortion is one that should hold accountable both the woman and the man. Since it is unrealistic, it is also illogical and unfair to punish the woman exclusively.
1.12.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.
1.12.9.4. Con: Fathers are held financially responsible for their children. It is not only mothers who are forced to take care of the unwanted children.
1.12.9.5. Con: Society doesn't allow women to murder their infants or toddlers and expects mothers to take care of those kids for 18+ years. It is not clear why murder to escape post-birth expectations would be unethical, but an extra six months pre-birth would be a valid excuse for terminating life.
1.12.9.6. Pro: Many fathers leave their children behind, leaving the mothers to care for them on their own.
1.12.9.7. Pro: In certain religious households where abstinence is an important virtue, women who get pregnant out of wedlock are shunned. This leaves pregnant women with very little financial and emotional support, while forcing them to be the sole provider for the child.
1.12.9.8. Con: This assumes childbearing and raising will always fall to women and trap them outside the work force and outside the full participation in society that men, being free of responsibility for children, have access to. While childbearing is pretty exclusive to women child raising is not. Men can and should raise children. Women are still fighting for full access to politics and boardrooms. But it's not childbearing that stops them. It is the patriarchy, which also prevents men raising kids.
1.12.10. Con: A world in which abortions were banned is one in which organizations like Planned Parenthood spend comparatively more time lobbying for access to contraceptives and education on how to use it.
1.12.10.1. Con: Planned Parenthood already believe there should be good access to contraception and education around it. However, they also believe in women's right to reproductive control, such that they would likely continue to fight for this as part of achieving equality, even if it were made illegal.
1.12.10.1.1. Con: Planned Parenthood makes money both performing abortions and selling off baby body parts, so there is a conflict of interest in recommending it to women who could be convinced to keep a child.
1.12.10.1.1.1. Con: [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/) is a nonprofit organisation.
1.12.10.1.1.1.1. Con: Planned Parenthood has income above what it spends every year but doesn't call it [profit](https://www.dailywire.com/news/11723/how-much-cash-did-planned-parenthood-clear-last-amanda-prestigiacomo#exit-modal).
1.12.10.2. Pro: Abortion is a symptom of an unequal society. If the sexes were equal there would be no rape, no abandonment of pregnant women by their male partners, women would be supported with pregnancies while studying and working, contraception would be shared and many other results. If there was true equality between the sexes the demand for abortion would be negligible to zero. If campaigners had put their energy into winning equality instead of abortion we would have better progress for women overall.
1.13. Con: Abortions are immoral.
1.13.1. Con: Abortion is [a part of nature](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/02/23/#.Wj4ISVQ-cWo).
1.13.1.1. Pro: Pregnant male [pipefish](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience//2010/03/17/pregnant-male-pipefish-abort-babies-from-unattractive-females/#.WkFv3xM-fow) abort babies from unattractive females.
1.13.1.1.1. Con: This is straying very far away from the parent argument. If we want to consider all odd animal behavior regarding pregnancy, there are many \(e.g. spiders\) that literally die for their offspring to have a life.
1.13.1.2. Pro: The [Bruce effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_effect) \(or pregnancy block\) is a tendency in animals \(mainly rodents\) to terminate their pregnancies following exposure to the scent of an unfamiliar male.
1.13.1.2.1. Pro: When a new male takes over a group of [geladas](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/02/23/the-bruce-effect-why-some-pregnant-monkeys-abort-when-new-males-arrive/#more-6420) in the wild, the vast majority of females terminate their [pregnancies](https://theethogram.com/2015/03/05/the-bruce-effect/).
1.13.1.2.2. Pro: [Bruce effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_effect) has been observed in deer-mice, meadow voles and collared lemmings.
1.13.1.2.3. Con: If it was natural for humans, we would have developed it ourselves. Instead, we have to rely on surgical procedures and/or drugs.
1.13.1.2.4. Con: This is another claim that doesn't have much to do with humans. Rodents and other animals also eat their babies if they aren't full enough to produce nutritious milk for all of [them.](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140328-sloth-bear-zoo-infanticide-chimps-bonobos-animals/)
1.13.1.3. Pro: Research suggests that pregnant female [horses](http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9440000/9440222.stm) might be able to make a subconscious decision, based on hormone levels to terminate their pregnancy.
1.13.1.4. Con: Just because abortion exists in nature does not give validity to its morality within human society.
1.13.1.5. Con: The contention that abortion is ethical or good because it occurs in nature is an [appeal to nature](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature), which is a logical fallacy.
1.13.1.6. Con: Rape and murder are natural but prevented through legal systems in most societies.
1.13.1.7. Con: Infanticide is also part of [nature](http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9440000/9440222.stm).
1.13.1.8. Con: So many strange things happen in nature regarding reproduction. Many of them no one would want to happen in human society. For example, female praying mantes often eat the male after having sex to provide more nutrients to the fetus.
1.13.2. Pro: Abortion promotes selfishness and a lack of respect for life as a whole.
1.13.2.1. Con: There is no evidence that abortion, or the legality of abortion, makes anyone more selfish or less respectful of anyone or anything.
1.13.2.1.1. Con: Abortion as well as the legality of abortion makes people less respectful of unborn babies.
1.13.2.2. Con: Selfishness would suggest that individuals engaging in abortion are gaining an immoral cost versus benefit of the procedure. This view discounts psychological and physical pain of abortion in addition to the necessity of abortion due to the surrounding circumstances such as quality of life for the infant, mother and the supporting community both familial and governmental.
1.13.2.3. Con: The same argument could be made for any kind of birth control. By that logic, wearing a condom is denying a potential child, similar to abortion.
1.13.2.3.1. Con: Genetically, a sperm is not identical to a human. A baby in the womb is.
1.13.2.4. Con: By definition, more women than men have had abortions. However, [women commit far fewer crimes](https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/emotions/men-more-violent.htm) or acts of violence than men do. Based on this, it does not seem that having an abortion makes a person less respectful of others.
1.13.2.4.1. Con: The previous claim is not true if you consider the unborn baby is another person. While legal, an abortion is an act of violence against the baby. In most cases it is a selfish choice that has no respect for the other life \(baby in the womb\).
1.13.2.4.2. Con: This does not counter the claim to the claim that having an abortion promotes selfishness and disrespect for life: Women who have not had abortions also commit fewer crimes than men. What is noted is a gender disparity. It remains possible that women who have abortions act with less regard for life, *and/or* that men who are the children / boyfriends / husbands of women who have aborted are more likely to commit crimes.
1.13.2.5. Pro: There are many claims here about "her body, her choice" putting "her" above all other considerations in this complex topic. Selfishness is very apparent.
1.13.2.5.1. Con: Everyone, at least in the US, has a right to their own bodily autonomy. So "her body" is in fact, a major consideration in this argument as there would be absolutely no chance for a baby without "her body". When a woman becomes pregnant her body undergoes drastic physical and hormonal changes to provide the environment to carry a child. She literally has to make lifestyle changes so that she can provide another with life. That in itself is the one of the greatest acts of unselfishness.
1.13.2.5.1.1. Con: Carrying, giving birth to, and raising a child in most cases is unselfish. Killing an unborn baby to avoid physical, hormonal and lifestyle changes on the other hand is selfish. This is true especially when taking in to account that pregnancy is avoidable.
1.13.2.5.2. Con: At the end of the day, it is 'her' who has to carry that child to term and raise it up into an adult. There is nothing more vital to the health and happiness of an individual than having a proper upbringing. If a woman who wishes not to have a child is theoretically forced to due to the law, then we can assume that child's life will suffer as a result. It is not selfishness, but about giving that child the best possible chance at life- with a mother who wishes for it to be born
1.13.2.6. Pro: Aborting an unborn baby requires placing the mothers convenience over the value of the baby's life.
1.13.2.6.1. Con: To the contrary, few women have abortions merely for convenience. There are many compelling reasons, economic, medical, emotional among others, why a woman might be compelled to have an abortion. Forcing a woman to bring a fetus to term not only requires her to be an incubator for 9 months, but may also lead to her death, poverty, inability to work, and other potential consequences that many do not consider. If it were just a matter of "convenience," abortions would be much rarer already.
1.13.2.6.1.1. Pro: Similarly, once that child is born the woman has to then raise it into an adult, provided she is not giving it up for adoption- something that is increasingly difficult to do when forming an emotional bond with the baby throughout the nine months of pregnancy. Raising a child requires a significant amount of time and money, something she may not be in the position to give. It is not about 'convenience', but about giving the child the best possible life.
1.13.2.7. Con: Imposing your will on another person, making them abide by your ideas and decisions is equally selfish and arguably more damaging. This whole argument is based on the idea that people have the right to tell women what to do, even if what they do doesn't harm you in any way.
1.13.2.7.1. Con: This is not a fair representation of the pro-life argument, which usually asserts that abortion is the intentional end of an innocent human life. Minimizing the argument to "\[telling\] women what to do" ignores the central argument of human rights and the right to life.
1.13.2.8. Con: Selfishness is not an inherently bad thing.
1.13.2.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.6.
1.13.2.10. Con: Criminalizing abortion, and consequently letting women risk their lives in clandestine abortion clinics, promotes a lack of respect for life as a whole.
1.13.3. Pro: In the U.S., 81% of Americans, including 66% of those who self-identify as pro-choice, support substantial [restrictions](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/19/abortion-poll-finds-81-americans-66-pro-choice-adv/) on abortion, and 55% believe that overall an abortion does more harm to a woman than good. This shows that there are substantial ethical concerns regarding current laws on abortion in the U.S.
1.13.4. Pro: 6 in 10 Americans, including one-third of those who identify as pro-choice, [believe abortion is morally wrong](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/19/abortion-poll-finds-81-americans-66-pro-choice-adv/).
1.13.4.1. Con: Popular opinion is not a relevant guide to morality; a majority of Americans once opposed interracial marriage, women’s suffrage, etc.
1.13.4.2. Con: This statement is a fallacy - an [appeal to majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum).
1.13.4.3. Con: 8 in 10 Swedes believe abortion should be permitted "whenever a woman wants one", whereas 85% of Brazilians believe the opposite. Morality isn't absolute. [buzzfeed.com](https://www.buzzfeed.com/lesterfeder/this-is-how-23-countries-around-the-world-feel-about-abortio?utm_term=.uaYdxypmV#.lqrK3PwkD)
1.13.4.4. Con: 4 in 10 Americans, including two-thirds who identify as pro-choice, [believe abortion is morally okay](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/19/abortion-poll-finds-81-americans-66-pro-choice-adv/).
1.13.4.5. Con: Beliefs of population differ both in time and in space. What Americans in 2018 consider immoral is not an absolute verdict on something. As little as one generation can completely change the scores you use in your argument.
1.13.4.6. Con: 6 in 10 Americans have the right not to abort even if the other 4 have choice of undergoing the abortion. The reverse is not true. Having abortion as an option executes the freedom of all parties, banning abortion caters to a disputabe slight majority.
1.13.5. Pro: From a philosophical perspective, we cannot definitively determine when exactly a human life starts. We cannot therefore assume a fetus is not a human. As human life is protected by law \(in most countries is it protected directly in the constitution\) we have to apply the precautionary principle and assume the fetus is protected from the moment of conception.
1.13.5.1. Con: With this assumption a miscarriage should be punished as an involuntary homicide.
1.13.5.1.1. Con: This is a fallacious comparison. Barring negligent behavior, like alcohol consumption, miscarriages are usually not caused by choices or actions. They are natural deaths, like catching a disease or dying of old age. On the contrary, abortion is an unnatural death cause directly by intentional human intervention.
1.13.5.2. Con: We can define criteria for what constitutes human life and validate those claims with medical science.
1.13.5.3. Pro: We cannot objectively define criteria for what constitutes human life. Such judgement would be very subjective and would base the granting of that status on physical attributes which would be immoral.
1.13.5.4. Con: If we can’t assume a fetus is not human by virtue of our ignorance, then we can’t assume that spermatozoa or unfertilized ova aren’t human either. Positive determinism works equally well in both cases.
1.13.5.5. Pro: If it is an epistemic possibility that an abortion is murder, in the same way is it an epistemic possibility drunk driving can kill, then it follows that such an action ought to be avoided as an unnecessary risk. If an action may kill someone, we act in a prudent manner and avoid the action on the premise of probability of outcome alone.
1.13.5.5.1. Con: Abortion is not murder. An unborn child does not qualify for the same set of rights and legal obligations as adults. Therefore, we do not need need to 'avoid the action' based on the 'probability' that it might be murder.
1.13.5.5.1.1. Con: That an entity doesn't qualify for the same legal rights as another, under some set of laws, doesn't entail that the entity doesn't have the same basic ethical rights as another entity i.e. lacking legal rights doesn't entail lacking fundamental rights \(or value, personhood, etc.\). For example, frequently in history many minorities were not granted the same legal rights as white males but clearly still had equal fundamental rights.
1.13.5.5.1.2. Con: "An unborn child" is not the standard that most would hope to set abortion laws by. Terminating a pregnancy is typically advocated only up to a certain point as there is a great difference between terminating an embryo and terminating a fully formed cognisant baby just prior to birth.
1.13.5.5.2. Con: Epistemic possibility is a low bar for proof of risk. With a reasonable amount of imagination, there is an epistemic possibility that any action \(walking out the front door\) could lead to catastrophic harm to oneself or others, but that is not used as a basis to deny individuals said action.
1.13.5.5.3. Con: Comparing drunk driving and abortion is not a legitimate analogy.
1.13.5.5.3.1. Pro: Claiming it's an epistemic possibility that abortion is murder is just begging the question at hand. It's not at all the same as taking a reckless risk of drunk driving where a person may be killed. In the drunk driving case we all already agree that the life taken is protected by our laws and social norms. That is just the issue being debated here.
1.13.5.5.3.2. Pro: From an epistemic point of view, "Can drunk driving kill?" and "Is abortion murder" are fundamentally different questions. One is provable or refutable by statistics and by studying the effects of alcohol and is a scientific question, while the other is a question about what we consider murder rather than whether or not it kills the foetus, and therefore belongs to a discussion of ethics and is not a scientific question, because it cannot be proven or refuted by science.
1.13.5.6. Con: If we cannot assume a fetus is not a human, we cannot assume it's human either. Choosing one is just a matter of opinion, and if it's a matter of opinion, that shouldn't be illegal, so everyone can make the choice individually.
1.13.6. Pro: [Abortion is used to cover up rape of minors and other vulnerable women.](http://www.lifenews.com/2016/01/19/at-13-i-rejected-abortion-after-my-stepfather-raped-me-thank-god-i-did-because-now-i-cant-have-kids/) A pregnancy is an indicator of sexual activity taking place and may be the only red flag of a bigger problem. This does not seem to be an isolated incident as [Planned Parenthood has been accused of failing to report suspected sexual crimes.](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/whistleblowers-expose-how-planned-parenthood-ignored-child-rape-in-latest-l)
1.13.6.1. Con: Reporting the sexual violence isn't the point of this discussion. The choice to terminate the pregnancy has nothing to do with whether or not sexual violence will be reported.
1.13.6.2. Con: This is not an issue of abortions, but of women's issues, gender issues, security, etc. If there is a safe enough environment, women will denounce their rapist.
1.13.6.3. Con: Abusers of women and girls should not have the right to choose an abortion - women should have the right to choose abortion.
1.13.7. Con: Even if abortion is immoral, this does not necessarily mean it should be illegal. Abortion should be legal but not publically funded.
1.13.7.1. Pro: If you are anti abortion you should not be required to pay for abortions. If you are pro abortions then you should fund and sponsor abortions.
1.13.7.2. Pro: Charity services can be implemented for poor people who cannot afford abortions.
1.13.7.3. Con: Access to health services should not be determined by a person's wealth.
1.13.7.4. Pro: This might be an acceptable compromise, provided that other objectionable things which people feel strongly about are also subject to exemptions from public funding.
1.13.7.5. Con: If abortion is immoral then we should legally forbid it.
1.13.7.6. Con: The mere possibility of abortion being both legal and morally reprehensible says nothing as to whether we ought to forbid it.
1.13.7.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.6.1.
1.13.7.8. Pro: Many women have abortions despite moral opposition to the procedure.
1.13.7.8.1. Pro: Research shows that women’s reasons for choosing abortion are overwhelmingly tied to their life situation as opposed to abstract, moral or religious principles. \([pg.3](http://www.abortionresearch.us/images/Vol20No1.pdf)\)
1.13.7.8.2. Pro: A 1981 [study](http://www.lifeissues.net/writers/air/air_vol20no1_20071.html) found that 25% of women facing an abortion decision considered the fetus to be human and regarded abortion as the taking of life whereas a 1995 study reported that 25% of women seeking an abortion agreed with the statement "abortion is against my beliefs."
1.13.7.9. Pro: The law exists to prevent harm, not enforce morality. As such the question of abortion's morality is irrelevant to the question of its legality.
1.13.7.9.1. Con: Ethics discusses not what it is, but what ought to be. Law should punish what ought not to be, and should not punish what ought to be. Slavery is not moral, or in other words, one ought not to enslave people, therefore, it should not be legal. Abortion's morality is relevant to the question of its legality if one ought to allow or ought not to allow abortion.
1.13.7.9.2. Con: A fetus is considered a separate entity, so by aborting it, you are causing harm towards it.
1.13.7.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.1.1.
1.13.7.9.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.7.1.1.5.1.
1.13.7.9.3. Con: The original claim makes no reference to the law. The question is one of rights in general. If the original claim were specifically about legal rights, then it would be a fundamentally different discussion.
1.13.7.9.4. Con: Morality exists as a construct to provide an internal framework within which human behavior does not cause harm. First degree murder, robbery, and kidnapping all fall under the descriptors of harmful, immoral, and illegal simultaneously for a reason.
1.13.7.9.5. Con: The law does prohibit immoral action. But it prohibits only a certain kind of immoral action. Illegal acts are acts that are immoral and also violate the rights of others.
1.13.7.9.5.1. Con: Not everything which is illegal is immoral by default. For example, women didn't have the right to vote, and while that was illegal, it clearly wasn't immoral. As such, something can't be immoral just because it's illegal.
1.13.7.9.5.1.1. Pro: Slavery is immoral as well, yet is still practiced in many parts of the world and many countries once considered it legal.
1.13.7.9.6. Con: This argument is predicated on the idea that an abortion does no harm to the child being aborted.
1.13.8. Con: Life is net suffering. Thus, every birth creates more suffering, especially when the child is unwanted. Abortion, therefore, is a means of restricting increases in the total amount of suffering in the world, which is not immoral.
1.13.9. Con: Fetuses don't have viable brains and aren't even capable of responding to averse stimuli until [about 23 weeks](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/books/chapters/the-ethical-brain.html). They're not sentient, not self-aware, not capable of thought, emotion, preferences, or [even aware of pain beyond reflex](https://philpapers.org/archive/LAGTEO-5.pdf) before the [third trimester](https://www.livescience.com/54774-fetal-pain-anesthesia.html). It has [less neurological activity](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/books/chapters/the-ethical-brain.html) than someone who has been declared brain dead. Is it life? Yes. Scientifically speaking, it is life, but it is not yet sentient life requiring moral consideration despite the potential to develop into such.
1.13.9.1. Con: This claim asserts that only sentience or the potential of sentience requires moral consideration. This is an unjustified assertion and therefore should not be used in order to permanently affect the lives of other humans, for example, ending them.
1.13.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.15.2.4.6.1.1.
1.13.11. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.1.1.
1.13.12. Pro: While ethics can change with the whims of a society, fundamental moral standards do not. If the murder of an innocent is a fundamental moral wrong, then [it would remain morally wrong](http://www.askphilosophers.org/question/5627), even if a society decided it was acceptable in some instances.
1.13.12.1. Con: Giving women the right to have abortions does not make abortions compulsory, it simply gives women the opportunity to make their own decisions. People should be able to make their own decisions about what they consider ethical and moral.
1.13.12.2. Pro: Choosing abortion implies the termination of an innocent life. The growing child inside her womb did not choose to be conceived, and the developing child hasn't broken any laws; it is innocent. Our rights do not allow us to harm the innocent lives of others, because our rights also protect us from being harmed by others.
1.13.12.2.1. Con: Choosing an abortion is the termination of a pregnancy and the prevention of a zygote/embreyo, or fetus from developing into a human being.
1.13.12.3. Pro: Murder of the innocent remains immoral whether a cannibalistic society allows it or not.
1.13.12.4. Pro: Slavery remains immoral regardless of a society that allows it.
1.13.12.5. Pro: The U.S. Declaration of Independence in particular takes note of the existence of underlying moral standards, regardless of societal ethics, with its declaration that humans have 'inalienable rights' such as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness which government cannot tamper with.
1.13.12.5.1. Pro: Humans retain these fundamental rights regardless of society. When the U.S. Supreme Court declared blacks to be non-persons according to the ethics of that time period, it had no moral force to make such a thing a reality.
1.13.12.5.2. Con: -> See 1.11.7.1.
1.13.12.5.3. Con: On this basis, banning abortion could constitute government interference with women's inalienable rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
1.13.12.5.3.1. Pro: By not legalising or banning abortion what results is giving the "state" the power of decision over a person's body. The state should not have inherence on a person's body.
1.13.12.5.4. Con: Granting that all people have rights, the debate is precisely whether or not a fetus is a person who possesses those rights. If it's not, no rights are violated.
1.13.12.6. Con: There are different morals and there is no humanly universal moral which is violated by abortion.
1.13.12.6.1. Con: A universal moral, seen across cultures, is to not end a human life without reason. If one defines a fetus as human life, just "wanting to" kill the fetus is just as morally reprehensible as just "wanting to" kill one's neighbor.
1.13.12.7. Con: Morality is a constructed, relative and subjective concept. Reality dictates what must be done, not fabricated representations of it. The only question that matters is "what counts as life?" Once this is answered there will be no ambiguity.
1.13.12.7.1. Con: If morality is constructed, relative and subjective, the question of "what counts as life?" is arbitrary, as it places subjective value on human life. Any criteria to determine life would also be subjective, so no resolution can ever be reached, as both sides of the argument can put forth their subjective claims to support their position. The claim that there is no objective morality is a weak starting point for any discussion that aims to find one "correct" solution.
1.13.12.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.7.1.1.
1.13.13. Con: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.
1.13.14. Con: The definition of abortion encompasses both spontaneous abortion, otherwise known as miscarriage, and conscious abortion. Yet, we do not place a moral value on miscarriage nor personhood on a miscarried embryo or foetus.
1.13.14.1. Pro: Miscarriage is a deliberate action taken by the body when it assesses that a pregnancy will not result in a healthy, successful baby. It may be induced by genetic defects or even the mother's malnutrition. With our more advanced ability to assess a positive outcome, either with genetic testing or our own conscious assessment of our life position, abortion is merely a modern, volitional extension of the miscarriage process taken with better information.
1.13.14.1.1. Con: Advances in medicine have sought to decrease the possibility of natural miscarriage, not increase it. Women facing natural miscarriage may or may not have wanted the child. The volitional aspect of abortion is what makes it very distinct from natural miscarriage, not an extension of it.
1.13.14.2. Con: It is nonsensical to posit a "moral value" on miscarriage: by [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moral), morals pertain to decisions made by people resulting in behavior, and no such circumstance exists when a miscarriage occurs spontaneously.
1.13.14.3. Con: Abortions or miscarriages which are a result of nature, rather than an action that was carried out to end the pregnancy, are considered differently with regards to morality as one is unavoidable and the other is an active choice to end a life.
1.13.14.3.1. Pro: Only human persons are morally culpable for person-induced abortions. The loss of human life by natural causes \(e.g. miscarriage\) is not caused by persons. Therefore, natural causes are not morally culpable for abortions.
1.13.14.3.2. Pro: No court will put disease or age on trial for a death by natural causes, but a court will try a person accused of premeditated murder.
1.13.14.4. Con: Death encompasses both natural death, such as from age or disease, capital punishment, death in war, accidental manslaughter, and premeditated murder. In all cases there is value granted to the life involved, regardless of how it ends.
1.13.14.4.1. Con: In the case of a miscarriage, much less value is assigned to the life than in the case of the death of an infant, child, or adult. Family and friends usually mourn more publicly, more intensely, for longer periods, and at greater personal expense. Often women miscarry without even letting people outside their innermost circle know that it has happened. Usually their grief, though real, is muted and temporary, and is not shared as deeply by others.
1.13.14.5. Con: A lot of people do assign personhood to their miscarried babies. They mourn them as they would a baby who had been born and then died.
1.13.15. Pro: Abortion is the unjustified taking of human life in most cases and the unjustified taking of human life should always be illegal. Therefore, unborn humans should be protected from abortion in most cases.
1.13.15.1. Con: One of the core questions of the abortion debate is the definition of human life. This claim assumes unborn fetuses to be autonomous human lives deserving of the same rights and protections as already-born people, which is a point of contention, not a fact to be taken for granted.
1.13.15.1.1. Con: [life](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHWL_enUS751US751&ei=Nvm6Wq34EqavjwTJxr-ABA&q=define%3A+life&oq=define%3A+life&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i7i30k1j0l3j0i7i30k1l4j0j0i7i30k1.4212.6717.0.9137.8.8.0.0.0.0.186.951.2j6.8.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.7.887...0i7i10i30k1.0.fRYLGD9LC64) noun 1.the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death.
2.the existence of an individual human being or animal.
A baby from the moment of conception has its own human dna distinct from the mother's and is beginning to grow. At week 5 blood cells develop and the baby can have a different blood type than the [mother's](https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/29654/how-does-a-fetus-retain-a-blood-group-different-from-its-mother). It is clearly an individual human [being](http://abort73.com/abortion/mothers_body/).
1.13.15.2. Pro: An unborn child cannot choose its parents, so abortion would be punishing an unborn life for doing nothing wrong.
1.13.15.3. Pro: The right to choose to kill someone should not be delegated based on a demographic \(whether someone is an expectant mother or not\).
1.13.15.3.1. Pro: The core reason to oppose abortion on demand for one sex is the equal application of the law. Three people are involved in every abortion. Only women are given any recognized rights. The "rights" she is "given," negate the rights of two other people. Women have been bestowed with a "constitutional right" to kill their children. There are no other examples of a constitutional right granted to one sex, nor other examples of rights granted to kill, except in self defense.
1.13.15.4. Pro: The right to kill someone else should not be delegated based upon one's relation to the victim.
1.13.15.5. Pro: It is possible the fetus being aborted was destined to be someone of great importance, like the next Albert Einstein. Imagine how the world could be different today if Einstein's mother had an abortion, we might not have won WWII.
1.13.15.5.1. Con: Then the reverse of this supposition is an equally valid argument. It is possible that the fetus being aborted was destined to be someone horrible, like the next Hitler. Imagine how the world could have been saved if Hitler had not been born. Thus, abortion would have saved the world from WWII at all.
1.13.15.5.2. Con: It's worth noting that a future wanted child may be forgone because an unwanted pregnancy is kept. Who's to say that the later child would not be the Einstein rather than the first. In fact all things being equal children who's parents intended their conception are likely more prepared to be parents than those who did not. As such these children are less likely to have adverse childhood experiences which could negatively effect the rest of the child's life.
1.13.15.6. Pro: Every human being has a right to life, because it is a human being and human beings have value in and of themselves. Other species, such as [acorns](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/acorns-and-embryos), have value based on other characteristic, like beauty or age, something they can gain or lose. Human beings cannot lose their value and have it as long as they live and a new member of the species is created after conception.
1.13.15.6.1. Con: If the mother has a fast-spreading uterine cancer, the surgery to remove the cancer may result in the loss of the child’s life. In an ectopic pregnancy the child is developing outside the uterus. He has no hope of survival, and may have to be removed to save his mother’s life. These are tragic situations, but even if one life must be lost, the life that can be saved should be. [epm.org](https://www.epm.org/resources/2010/Feb/20/what-about-woman-whose-life-threatened-pregnancy-o/)
1.13.15.7. Pro: Laws and courts have established that the decision to kill another human being should not be based on someone's personal belief that the other person is an inconvenience to them or the assumption that they might be to others, and that disregard for an individual's life and the ending that life should not be tolerated regardless of a person's age even if they are the parent.
1.13.15.8. Pro: The CDC and the National Association of Medical Examiners recognize [four categories of death](https://www.cdc.gov/misc/hb_me.pdf): 1\) Natural - death by medical illness or old age. 2\) suicide - intentionally ending one's own life. 3\) accidental - unintentionally ending a human life. 4\) homicide - intentionally ending another human life. Based on this, abortion \(an intentional act done to end the life of a fetus\) can only be considered homicide.
1.13.15.9. Con: Whether abortion is justified, is exactly the question we are trying to answer. You cannot just assume that the taking of a life in the case of abortion is unjustified in most cases, without explaining in which cases abortion would be justified or unjustified.
1.13.15.10. Con: "Human" and "Life" are arbitrary definitions, with no clear basis in biology. There is no clear line between "Human" and "not Human" nor between "Life" and "not Life". All such definitions are arbitrary and flawed, excluding some things we wish to include or vice versa.
1.13.16. Pro: Legal access to abortion means many doctors are put in the position of having to conduct an operation or aid an operation they may find deeply distressing and immoral.
1.13.16.1. Con: Women having the right to choose abortion does not mean that all doctors are required to perform abortions.
1.13.16.1.1. Con: In a society in which abortion is legal, doctors who are unwilling to perform abortions risk being stigmatised. This is unfair.
1.13.16.1.1.1. Con: Doctors specialize by nature of their profession. There is no stigma for choosing one specialty over another. Only [14%](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2011/08/22/139859979/proportion-of-ob-gyns-offering-abortions-may-be-lower-than-thought) of OB-GYNs perform abortions.
1.13.16.1.2. Pro: OBGYN physicians can choose which procedures they do or do not take part in. Some OBGYN's will perform abortions, but only under certain circumstances.
1.13.16.1.3. Pro: In a number of countries, medical professionals are allowed to [conscientiously object](https://www.bpas.org/get-involved/advocacy/briefings/conscientious-objection/) to performing abortions and the cases are passed on to other professionals.
1.13.16.1.3.1. Con: -> See discussion #2851: Conscientious objection to abortion should be banned
1.13.16.1.4. Pro: Doctors do not have to work in abortion clinics. If they feel the act is immoral, they can just not perform it.
1.13.16.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.13.16.1.1.
1.13.16.2. Pro: Individuals become doctors, because they want to [save lives,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath) they do not become doctors because they want to end life.
1.13.16.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.7.1.1.7.2.
1.13.16.2.2. Con: This is a very presumptuous assumption. Certainly it could be argued at least a subset of doctors are motivated by access to work opportunities and good pay rather than a desire to save life, and equally so for many other plausible alternative motivations.
1.13.16.2.3. Con: Do not confuse "Life" with "Personhood". We kill millions of living things daily. Abortion concerns the definition of a legal person and the definition of murder.
1.13.16.2.4. Con: Doctors take oaths to "do no harm". In some cases extending life does constitute a harm. This is a serious consideration that should be made before becoming a doctor.
1.13.16.3. Con: A doctor who feels strongly about this has the option of pursuing a different specialty.
1.13.16.4. Con: When we choose a vocation we should consider all responsibilities of that vocation and whether or not we are willing to do the job. If we are not willing to do the job we should select a different vocation.
1.13.16.4.1. Pro: If they aren't emotionally capable of performing important procedures, they shouldn't be doctors.
1.13.16.5. Pro: Abortions violate the [Hippocratic oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath).
1.13.16.5.1. Con: The Hippocratic Oath has no [legal](https://gizmodo.com/doctors-aren-t-actually-bound-by-the-hippocratic-oath-1465044222) status and is only a symbolic ritual that contains outdated content.
1.13.16.5.1.1. Pro: Technically, administering any medication with side effects violates the Hippocratic Oath.
1.13.16.5.2. Con: The [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath) originates from around the 3rd-5th centuries BC. Whatever it says should not be used as an argument in the 21st century.
1.13.16.5.3. Con: The [Hippocratic oath](http://www.arcc-cdac.ca/postionpapers/71-Abortion-Hippocratic-Oath.PDF) only forbids a specific abortion method - a "pessary" \(a vaginal insert of some sort\). Some texts attributed to Hippocrates describe abortions as a fairly common, uncontroversial procedure.
1.13.16.5.4. Con: -> See 1.13.16.2.4.
1.13.17. Pro: Late stage abortions are particularly ethically problematic, because the baby would likely have survived if it was born immediately.
1.13.17.1. Con: This point concerns a very specific \(and truly unfortunate\) scenario and cannot be used to judge the validity of the original claim - that abortions are universally "both immoral and unethical".
1.13.17.1.1. Con: The above claim does not undermine the idea that all abortions are immoral and unethical. Rather, it points to a specific instance where they are particularly ethically problematic.
1.13.17.1.2. Pro: According to the Guttmacher Institute, [88 percent](https://www.livestrong.com/article/181997-facts-about-adoption-instead-of-abortion/) of abortions occur within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, with only 1.5 percent occurring after 21 weeks' gestation. This is mostly because late term abortions risk the life of the mother and are often done because of serious issues.
1.13.17.1.2.1. Pro: The possibility of a woman's death associated with abortion [increases](https://www.livestrong.com/article/181997-facts-about-adoption-instead-of-abortion/) with the length of gestation. The risk of the mother's death for an abortion at between 16 and 20 weeks' gestation is one in 29,000, while the risk increases to one in 11,000 for abortions after 21 weeks.
1.13.17.2. Pro: There is very little difference between a late stage fetus and a newborn baby in terms of development, such that late term abortions are questionable as we would not allow people to end the life of a newborn.
1.13.17.3. Pro: [4d ultrasound technology](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/03/health.healthandwellbeing) can show detailed images of  babies in the womb. From 12 weeks onward babies can be seen smiling, crying, walking, sucking their thumb, stretching and yawing. These images, which show babies acting like human beings, demonstrate why late stage abortion is wrong.
1.13.17.4. Con: Almost all post-viability abortions are on women whose fetuses have died or are severely impaired such that they will not survive outside the womb. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2016/10/20/no-late-term-abortions-dont-rip-babies-out-of-wombs-but-they-are-needed/#5d67bd0b5cf8) [Jen Gunter, MD](https://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2016/10/27/how-many-late-term-abortions-are-really-performed-in-the-united-states/)
1.13.17.5. Con: There are [many reasons](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/10015#.WhrwQEpl86w) why women seek late term abortions that are legitimate and should not result in the woman's choice being removed.
1.13.17.5.1. Pro: Irregular period cycles can make pregnancies hard to detect.
1.13.17.5.2. Pro: A lack of access to abortion clinics within a region can mean that women have arrange to travel to a clinic, which can take time and resources to arrange.
1.13.17.5.2.1. Con: It is unlikely, especially in the US, that such travel limitations would last long enough to necessitate a late term abortion.
1.13.17.5.3. Pro: Pregnancies caused by rape or incest are traumatic, and this trauma can delay women seeking out an abortion.
1.13.17.5.4. Pro: Many young women delay getting an abortion because they feel ashamed and worry about how their parents might respond.
1.13.17.5.5. Pro: Drastic changes to a woman's situation could make her question her ability to raise a child, such as the death of her partner, or a large financial loss.
1.13.17.5.6. Con: None of the reasons that are made for having a late term abortion justify killing a living child that could survive outside the womb.
1.13.17.5.7. Pro: Such cases are often life or death for the mother. Doctors and the mother should be free to make those decisions based on sound medical practice. The State should not be involved in those decisions.
1.13.17.5.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.17.1.2.1.
1.13.17.5.7.2. Con: While abortion may be necessary when the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother, it should be restricted to cases of life and death, not issues of convenience.
1.13.18. Con: Abortions have the same ethical ramifications as abstinence and contraception - all three result in the lack of a life that could have existed. If abortion is unethical, so is avoiding impregnating or being impregnated at any time.
1.13.18.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.3.
1.13.18.2. Con: This is a fallacy of equivocation. In the event of an abortion, the life of the child has already begun, so there exists something to be destroyed.
1.13.18.3. Con: This only works if a child in a womb is not already living. Otherwise, there is a difference in moral categories here: Abortion is a direct act against a life already living. Abstinence is not.
1.13.18.3.1. Pro: Nor is preventing pregnancy through pre-conception methods.
1.13.18.4. Con: The three things are very different, so do not have equivalent ethical ramifications.
Abstinence: Cannot possibly terminate a biological human organism under any circumstances.
Contraception: Some forms can rarely lead to a biological human organism dying due to blocked implantation, while others forms \(like condoms\) can never harm a human life.
Abortion: Tries to, and usually succeeds, in directly terminating a  biological human organism.
1.13.18.4.1. Con: What is a "Human organism"? sperm? morula? fetus? there is a distinction between them too. A morula is not a human, a sperm is not a human, if you take out the morula from the uterus you cannot give it legal rights because it doesn't looks or act as a person. A fetus, from 3 months and on, is considered a person because only in that stage it reach a person's similarities.
1.13.18.5. Con: Neither abortion advocates nor pro-life advocates claim that there is an ethical mandate to bring all theoretically possible life into the world, so this interpretation of the ethical ramifications is an example of an [appeal to extremes](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/30/Appeal-to-Extremes) fallacy.
1.13.18.6. Pro: It is generally agreed that no one can force a woman to conceive a child. So no one can forbid a woman from using contraception. Therefore, no woman should be made to carry a fetus to term. There is no difference between preventing conception by killing sperm or preventing implantation and terminating pregnancy after contraception has failed.
1.13.18.6.1. Con: The key difference here is that separately, sperm and eggs are just reproductive cells, but once an egg has been fertilised, [prenatal development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_fertilization) is initiated and therefore a life has begun.
1.13.18.6.1.1. Con: The beginning of development doesn't mean that something has developed. The fact that a cell has begun to duplicate and become more complex doesn't mean that it is already a new person.
1.13.18.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.
1.13.18.7. Con: It is generally agreed upon that there is an action/inaction distinction. This is why not becoming an aid worker or not donating 90% of one's income to charity is not immoral. Given this, abstinence and contraception are merely inaction resulting in a lack of life, whereas abortion is a specific action which leads the destruction of life.
1.13.18.7.1. Con: According to this reasoning, eating seeds should be considered deforestation because a particular action \(eating\) is "destroying" the life of a tree.
1.13.18.7.2. Con: The action/inaction distinction is a matter of ease - it is hard to sacrifice your hard-earned money even when you know it's the right thing to do, but easy not to go out and rob a charity. An abortion and a healthy pregnancy both require effort and active intent.
1.13.18.7.3. Con: Contraception is not inaction, as it requires very specific actions to be used.
1.13.18.7.3.1. Con: Contraception prevents the action of initiating a life. Fertilization is the important action here.
1.13.19. Con: Ethics and morality are subjective and can vary from society to society or even from person to person. Therefore abortion is not necessarily always immoral or unethical.
1.13.19.1. Pro: One's moral system is the direct result of their religious upbringing in most cases.
1.13.19.2. Con: Different people can hold different opinions of ethics, however that does not mean they are all equally correct and does not prove the subjectivity of ethical rules.
1.13.19.3. Con: If this is the case, we cannot say that murder, rape, or theft are wrong, but simply considered unethical in our society.
1.13.19.3.1. Con: This is not an argument. The statement is correct but does not invalidate the fact that ethics and morals are subjective.
1.13.19.4. Pro: The very definition of ethics is very subjective: some may say it is linked to religion, others to what the majority believes or even to common sense, so ethics could even be used as an argument in support of abortion.
1.13.19.5. Pro: Morals are a set of rules that individuals live by. It is exceedingly arrogant to suggest that people with different morals are somehow incorrect or wrong. It is not up to other individuals to police the morals of any other person. That is why women should always have the right to choose what happens to their own body and to live by the morals they choose for themselves.
1.13.19.5.1. Con: If a society polices for murder, theft, or other crimes considered immoral, then that society finds it ethically acceptable to determine what is a crime, create laws to prohibit that crime, and then police to enforce the law. These laws may change over time as the society reevaluates and changes, but the fundamental ethics of the society hold that it may create laws based in moral principles and then enforce them.
1.13.19.5.2. Con: Saying that “women should always have the right to choose” is a moral judgment, that according to your argument, can not be judged as “correct” or “right.” All laws are codifications of moral judgments, and there are some acts that are universally considered immoral, such as the taking of an innocent human life.
1.13.19.6. Pro: Morality is not an universal concept. In countries such as Egypt, the simple act of a woman drinking alcohol on the street is considered immoral \(which does not happen to men\).
1.13.19.7. Con: Ethics can vary from culture to culture, some allowing cannibalism and slavery, for example. However, the underlying moral standards of right and wrong do not vary, even if a culture chooses not to base its ethics in those moral principles.
1.13.19.7.1. Con: There is no indication to believe that there are moral standards of right and wrong.
1.13.19.8. Pro: As with all acts, the morality of abortion varies with the person's context.
1.13.19.9. Pro: Abortions are only considered immoral and unethical on a religious basis. Forcing all women to adhere to a specific religion is religious discrimination.
1.13.19.9.1. Con: Many atheists and agnostics hold that abortions are unethical and do so on [secular grounds.](http://www.secularprolife.org/)
1.13.19.9.2. Con: [Many religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_abortion), not just one 'specific religion,' take a stance against abortion.
1.13.19.9.3. Con: Religious individuals, just as irreligious individuals, voting for a law for or against an action, would not force anyone to adhere to a specific religion if the law was passed unless the law itself forced compliance with a particular religion.
1.13.19.9.3.1. Con: But if that law comes from a place of religious obligation, then isn't it by definition a "religious law"? By passing a law based on your religious beliefs you are effectively forcing them upon others by law.
1.13.19.9.3.2. Pro: In countries like the U.S., congress has no power to establish a religious denomination as the state religion or enforce a particular type of worship, etc., so a law forcing one to keep a religion cannot be made.
1.13.20. Con: -> See 1.11.7.1.3.
1.13.21. Con: In an instance where the pregnant woman's life is at risk and the fetus would not survive on it's own; utilitarianism argues that an abortion would be more ethical than letting both the woman and the fetus die since the overall good of saving the woman's life outweighs any unethical implications of abortions.
1.13.21.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.5.1.4.
1.13.21.2. Pro: A woman should have the right to take steps to defend her life in the event that carrying a child to term would end in the death of both the fetus and the mother.
1.13.21.3. Con: Most cases where the mother's life is in direct danger are treatable via medicine. While this often has the side effect of the unborn child dying, directly killing the child is usually unnecessary.
1.13.21.4. Con: The utilitarian argument is not the only basis in determining the ethical implications of abortion.
1.13.21.4.1. Con: This discussion contains many non-utilitarian arguments for and against abortion. Utilitarian evaluations are relevant to many people, particularly utilitarians, whether they are the sole basis for every person's opinion or not.
1.14. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.7.
