Discussion Title: Should people have the right and means to end their lives?

1. Every human should have the right and means to decide when and how to die.
1.1. Pro: People are able to commit suicide regardless of whether there is a right to die or not. Legalizing suicide would get rid of various problems that plague the status quo.
1.1.1. Pro: Doctors and [family members](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/25/assisted-suicide-guidelines-family-prosecution) are often [prosecuted](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2396490/Wife-son-arrested-planning-fly-man-Switzerland-help-commit-assisted-suicide.html) for assisting a family member in dying. This involves imposing criminal sanctions on individuals whose compassion caused them to carry out the final wishes of a loved one or patient.
1.1.1.1. Con: Family members who are too acquiescent to the wishes of a potentially irrational ill family member ought to be prosecuted for their actions, both as a deterrence and as retribution against an immoral action.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Compassion should not be criminalized.  If it was the will of the individual, they are not a victim to murder. Thus anyone who aided\(aids\) in the end of their suffering is not technically guilty of murder.
1.1.1.3. Pro: This body of thought could mean that  any soldier who has killed someone is guilty of murder as well.  It is highly likely that veterans with PTSD or who commit suicide have at least some rooting in self-punishment because they didn't really want to kill anyone.
1.1.2. Pro: Legalization would make consulting procedures with experts, which could cause patients to reconsider their choice, more accessible, as is currently the case with abortion.
1.1.2.1. Pro: At the moment, there is not a robust culture of talking to medical professionals about suicidal thoughts. This policy would instigate a cultural shift.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Cultural taboos against suicide mean that people are reluctant to discuss their suicidal thoughts with other people, including medical professionals. By legalising suicide and therefore making it more acceptable, these taboos would lessen.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Since patients would not have to fear being hospitalized or otherwise institutionalized as soon as they reveal to a doctor that they are considering suicide, they would be more likely to engage with the medical system and seek support and guidance.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Doctors would be able to provide support and guidance for those wanting to die, rather than being required to [discourage or institutionalise them.](https://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/suicide.pdf)
1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: [Medical professionals](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2013/09/11/most-doctors-oppose-physician-assisted-suicide-poll-finds), by large, oppose euthanasia. As those are the experts in the field their opinion should receive special attention.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: The views of medical professionals are influenced by their adherence to strict professional norms, particularly the [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath), wherein medical professionals promise "first, do no harm." Insofar as these norms don't apply to non-medical professionals, their view doesn't speak against broader public views.
1.1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: As they are experts in the field of curing and treating illnesses, it is in their best interest to oppose suicide for their patients. Who will they treat if their patients choose death?
1.1.2.2.1.1.3. Con: The debate about euthanasia is a debate about ethics, not medicine. Doctors do not have access to any special knowledge of the human soul or personal rights. An appeal to the opinion of a doctor on the matter of euthanasia is an appeal to a false authority.
1.1.3. Pro: Under the status quo, [passive euthanasia](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/28/us/passive-euthanasia-in-hospitals-is-the-norm-doctors-say.html) \(withdrawing life support or other medication to allow a patient to die\) is [common](http://www.otago.ac.nz/law/research/journals/otago085109.pdf). Yet passive euthanasia always leads to a longer process of dying and thus more suffering than active euthanasia.
1.1.3.1. Con: There [are no](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/13/search-humane-execution-flawed-no-such-thing-oklahoma) fully painless or instant methods of killing someone.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Despite this, most forms of active euthanasia are likely to be comparatively quicker and more painless than most forms of passive euthanasia.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Enabling the right to die would allow research into painless methods of life termination without the ethical issues that currently cloud such matters. There would be a humane reason for developing better and more reliable euthanizing substances.
1.1.4. Pro: Those who commit suicide in the status quo may do it in secret, making the death a traumatizing shock to those in their surroundings. This would enable more individuals to be open about their desire to die, thus allowing them and their family to better come to terms with their decision to die.
1.1.4.1. Pro: People close to the individual who commits suicide may feel that they could and should have done more to prevent it, thus leaving them with intense feelings of guilt.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Bereaved families of euthanasia patients [suffer less](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC166123/) than those who lose a family member because of natural causes.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: A right to die comes with an increase in the numbers of voluntary deaths. In the Netherlands, for example, both  [suicide](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2014/50/suicides-rise-substantially-again) and [euthanasia](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/10330823/Number-of-Dutch-killed-by-euthanasia-rises-by-13-per-cent.html) rates rose.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Con: There is always that statistical portion that either actively chooses suicide or passively chooses self neglect. It seems unlikely that a formalization of the "right to die" significantly increases it.
1.1.4.1.3. Con: A planned, rightful suicide will allow for it to be less traumatic. The individual who commits suicide will be able to bid farewell to his relatives and explain his decision, releasing them from future guilt.
1.1.4.1.4. Con: People feel guilt for all sorts of decisions made by others, and this is generally not seen as a reason to limit those decisions.
1.1.4.1.5. Con: Sometimes there's nothing you can do to make a suicidal person change their idea.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Sudden and unexpected losses tend to [affect](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/healing-trauma-s-wounds/201504/dealing-unexpected-loss) family members and friends far more severely. The cognitive, emotional, psychological, and physical impact is profound.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: The ability of family members to plan for and emotionally prepare themselves for grief would drastically reduce the emotional burden on them - if their relative dies unexpectedly, they may be hit by grief at a particularly vulnerable time in their life.
1.1.4.3. Pro: Communicational distortions for family members with their social contacts attributed to suicide will be eliminated or mitigated.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Survivors of suicide have a high tendency to be secret about the cause of death of their family members and can cause dysfunction \([Cerel et al., p. 39](http://file:///C:/Users/Gregor/Desktop/Xerx/impact%20of%20suicide%20on%20family.pdf)\). With a right to death acknowledged by society there is less reason to hide the cause of death.
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: Comparatively, society judges suicide survivors more negative than other causes of loss \([Cereal et al., p. 39](http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/full/10.1027/0227-5910.29.1.38)\). Thus, a right to die will improve the views of societies to survivors.
1.1.4.3.3. Pro: Family members often do not talk about the causes of suicide to protect sensitive family members \([Cerel et al., p. 39](http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/full/10.1027/0227-5910.29.1.38)\). As a right to die can be communicated more openly in advance this mitigates this problem.
1.1.4.4. Con: Mental health effects are the same for suicide and non-suicide survivors within the first 8 weeks in case an older adult dies \([Cerel et al., p. 41](http://file:///C:/Users/Gregor/Desktop/Xerx/impact%20of%20suicide%20on%20family.pdf)\). This suggests that the effects of a right to die are limited.
1.1.4.4.1. Con: Those who suffer losses because of suicide keep experiencing intense grief after 6 months while those who experience other losses show signs of bettering.
1.1.5. Con: This would make murder harder to prove \(and thus harder to prevent\) due to arguments of consensual death.
1.1.5.1. Con: Not necessarily. Presuming the proposal is one that involves legal oversight, bureaucratic institutions, paperwork and time delay, it's easy to see how someone who pre-meditates and anticipates their own death would be easily differentiated from someone who was abruptly murdered and left behind a scrawled note "I wanted to be dead."
1.1.5.2. Con: Any argument that could be made in support of this claim could also be leveled currently on suicide. Legalizing right-to-death would in fact eliminate some of the possibility that murders could be disguised as suicides.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Legalization of the right to die might lead to certified documents attesting the assisted suicide, making it certain.
1.1.6. Pro: Humans did not choose to live and have every right to end it whenever they want. Currently people commit suicide but they do this in ways that are unworthy of a human life. If somebody jumps in front of a train to end their suffering, the suffering is ended plus hundreds of people have to wait in a train. If somebody goes to a clinic to get a popshot nobody suffers.
1.1.7. Con: You have the option, but should not be allowed to force others to participate, aid or help you in your suicide.
1.1.7.1. Con: You shouldn't be allowed to force someone, but society should provide proper help in case you need it. Even when it leads to \(institutionalised\) suicide.
1.1.8. Pro: If people are unable to use the medical system for assisted dying, they may commit suicide at an earlier point in time than they otherwise would. By prohibiting assisted dying, the government may actually be interfering with the right to life.
1.1.9. Pro: It would allow a much cleaner death than using a weapon or noose
1.1.10. Pro: More people who are considering suicide would come forward.  They would be more likely to be able to get help, or at least they would be able to make peace with those who will be left behind.
1.1.11. Con: There are many patients who are really incapable of commiting suicide and usually these are the ones popping in discussions like this.
1.1.11.1. Con: Right to die also applies to assisted suicide. As long as the person can express their desires clearly, they should have the right to request this.
1.1.11.2. Pro: Example of people like this: People permanently in bunks generally. Old people with no power to even walk, oncology patients who sometimes find it hard to even read. Just very sick people with no power left. Here in Czech republic doctors will try to save you in any case no matter how much you scream you want to die. There is no choice to even refuse treatment.
1.2. Pro: It is central to personal autonomy and bodily integrity that each person is able to embrace a timely and dignified death on their own terms.
1.2.1. Pro: The prevention of death for as long as possible is [often not among](http://spcare.bmj.com/content/early/2017/03/02/bmjspcare-2016-001177) the top priorities of patients with terminal illnesses. A coercive culture which encourages them to extend their life for as long as possible thus contradicts the autonomous choices they would make if given the opportunity.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Sentencing someone to maybe years of living in agony, would not be an acceptable punishment, for the most despicable crime imaginable. There is no justification for passing such a sentence on someone who's only crime was to become ill.
1.2.2. Pro: Choosing to die is not relevantly different from doing anything else with our bodies. Since we possess a fundamental right to do those other things, we possess a fundamental right to terminate our own lives.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Choosing to eat unhealthily, smoke, or refrain from exercising are all behaviours that are similarly self-destructive, yet the state does not regulate them.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: The state does increasingly take actions to encourage people against these choices though e.g. consistently raising the price of cigarettes, or running campaigns that promote exercise and healthy eating.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: At least part of the state's motivation for regulating these activities is because of the high cost of health care for diseases related to unhealthy lifestyles. This is not the case with the decision to die.
1.2.2.2. Con: Choosing to die is importantly different from all other choices we make regarding what we do with our bodies as it is instantaneously removes further choices and actions.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: All choices limit future choices. For instance, if I choose to do A, I cannot choose not to have done A. This property of choices does not provide a moral basis on which we can interfere with the personal decisions of others.
1.2.2.3. Con: Since we have no way of knowing what death is like, decisions to die are made on the basis of fundamentally incomplete information and it is therefore impossible to rationally choose to die.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: Although we cannot directly experience death, we can make rough comparisons. For example, to test whether our life is worth living, we might ask whether it is true of most of our days that we'd rather sleep through them than experience them.
1.2.2.3.2. Con: If our current life is very bad, even if we do not fully understand death, we can make a probabilistic judgement that it's likely to be less bad than our currently miserable life.
1.2.2.3.3. Con: Consent is not dependent on having all the relevant information available. Otherwise, it would be impossible to consent to anything, since we never have perfect information.
1.2.2.3.4. Con: There is also no way of knowing the absolute truth behind our existence, yet it is considered acceptable for us to choose to drive our actions based on philosophical viewpoints such as religious belief or empirical knowledge.
1.2.2.3.4.1. Pro: Those who have had a Near Death Experience would certainly agree.
1.2.2.3.5. Pro: We can only reasonably act on the basis of what we can know and experience. As what exists in life, is always more certain than what death entails, prioritizing what we can make out of the life we have, should also always be considered the more rational approach.
1.2.2.3.5.1. Con: If we can only reasonably act on the basis of what we can know and experience, and all that we have known and experienced is pain, suffering and misery, then choosing to continue an existence of pain, suffering and misery cannot be considered rational when a choice exists to end the pain, suffering and misery.
1.2.2.3.6. Con: Though we cannot objectively know what death is like, we do know what suffering is like. When suffering reaches an unacceptable level without any hope of improvement, one should be able to take a change towards the unknown rather than staying in a known state of permanent suffering.
1.2.2.4. Pro: If humans have the right to poison their body with drugs, alcohol, tobacco, food additives etc. to die slowly and painfully,  they must have the  right to decide to die fast and without pain.
1.2.3. Con: Since being alive is necessary for the existence of autonomy and bodily integrity, preventing people from dying is the ultimate form of protecting these rights.
1.2.3.1. Con: If it was true that preventing people from dying is the ultimate way to fulfill rights, then the state would be licensed to violate anyone's rights, as long as doing so saves lives; for example, torturing a terrorist to prevent a terrorist attack would be considered a "maximisation of rights." This is not how the state should operate.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Even if the state were to take it upon itself to maximise rights in this way, it is clear that actively violating someone's right is worse than passively failing to maximise their rights, so the state should not violate someone's autonomy by preventing them from dying in order to maximise their autonomy in the long run.
1.2.3.2. Con: While being alive is necessary for the existence of autonomy and bodily integrity, it is not sufficient. In cases where it is unattainable for other reasons, preventing people from dying therefore does not meaningfully protect them.
1.2.3.3. Con: Plenty of rights conflict one another.  The right to join the armed services is not curtailed by the likelihood to decease in a given act of service.
1.2.3.4. Con: Death is unavoidable, unpreventable.
1.2.4. Con: Governments limit personal autonomy and self-determination in various ways to protect individuals from themselves.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The state bans drug consumption.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: The state also prescribes different kinds of drug consumption, many of which are used to commit suicide.
1.2.4.2. Pro: The state enforces various safety regulations like mandatory seatbelt or bike helmet laws.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: The intrusion on our autonomy in these cases is negligible; no one cares very deeply about not wearing a seatbelt or a bike helmet. So the fact that the state does this does not justify more serious state violations of autonomy.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: These laws are also designed to help individuals achieve their personal goals of staying safe, as many people do not realize the dangers of not using safety equipment. They do not hinder peoples freedoms as most people affected by these law would want to stay safe anyway.
1.2.4.3. Pro: We generally try to discourage all forms of self harm, such as cutting or starving, implying that we do not believe those actions to be a reflection or promotion of personal autonomy. Similarly, society tries to discourage suicide - for example, through suicide hotlines, police officers talking people off of bridges, etc.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: Self-harm is almost always irrational. So if someone engages in self-harm, this implies that they are acting due to mental illness or some other factor which distorts decisionmaking, and the state is therefore justified in stopping them. By contrast, choosing to die is often rational.
1.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: Self-harm involves causing oneself unnecessary pain without, typically, bringing any benefit. There are very few circumstances where it is a rational decision, and it is therefore safe to assume that it is caused by a mental illness.
1.2.4.3.1.2. Con: Depending on how one interprets the term, self-harm can include various activities that are usually not considered irrational, for example piercings, tattoos or even [sports](http://labblog.uofmhealth.org/body-work/giving-birth-an-athletic-event).
1.2.4.3.1.3. Con: Self-harm can in many cases be rational.
1.2.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: Forms of self-harm such as cutting serve rational purposes, for example psychological and emotional relief, disassociation from oneself and even sexual satisfaction \([Yip, p. 81](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-3588.2005.00122.x/full)\).
1.2.4.3.1.3.2. Pro: Starving oneself can serve various purposes: dealing with body satisfaction issues and striving for thinness \([Raymond et al., p. 139](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1098-108X\(199509\)18:2%3C135::AID-EAT2260180205%3E3.0.CO;2-M/full)\); committing [religious suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayopavesa); or engaging in protest or resistance through hunger strike.
1.2.4.3.1.3.3. Pro: What is rational depends on what an individual values and believes. That is something likely to vary significantly between individuals.
1.2.4.3.2. Con: When a terminally ill individual in great pain makes the decision to end their life, they are in fact choosing to end harm being done to them. Thus, the analogy between ending one's life and committing self-harm does not hold.
1.2.4.3.3. Con: Many people do not want to harm themselves but may do so anyway because of various reasons such as addiction pushing them to continue self harm. Providing aid through mechanisms such as rehab facilities or suicide hotlines, only implies that we want to help those want to stop harming themselves, but are unable to.
1.2.4.3.4. Pro: The state gives out [advice](http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_i/I104/) to parents of adolescents on how to treat self-harm behavior.
1.2.4.3.5. Pro: The state sponsors [leaflets](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Self-harm%20-%20%20Limiting%20the%20Damage%20Final.pdf) for self-harm victims to get help.
1.2.4.3.6. Pro: Schools run self-injuries [protocols](http://www.selfinjury.bctr.cornell.edu/documents/schools.pdf) to handle cases efficiently.
1.2.4.4. Con: The fact that governments do limit individual's autonomy does not necessarily show that they should in each and every case. Indeed, that is what is under discussion in this debate.
1.2.4.5. Con: The government should have no say in personal decisions unless those decisions infringe upon the freedoms of others.
1.2.5. Pro: Enabling people to choose how and when they will die is likely to better their mental health during their lives, as this allows for a feeling of control and a deeper understanding of the impact of death on themselves and their loved ones.
1.2.6. Pro: Humans do have a right to take their own lives, since it belongs to them, and it's a matter of personal sovereignty.
1.2.7. Pro: The alternative in terminal care is simply unplugging all machines and letting the person die "naturally".  This removes any dignity from the terminal person and can wreak havoc on the emotion state of friends and family of the person, as well as the person themselves if applicable.
1.2.8. Pro: All the people should have the right to live a dignified life. That means also to have the right to chose death when this kind of life is not possible anymore.
1.2.9. Pro: When an individual's body or mind is deteriorating to a point where living would have no dignity, and death would only be a means of suffering with a high price tag. The right to chose a dignified death is imperative.
1.2.10. Pro: If humans have any rights about their lives at all, the most basic and fundamental right should be the choice whether to live or not.
1.2.11. Pro: Unless an individual has the right to choose to die, he is not truly free.  He is instead a prisoner or servant of the entity who forces him to live against his will.
1.2.12. Pro: In a civilised society the goal should be to minimise suffering while respecting individual freedoms, it is therefore logical for one to have the right to choose to terminate his or her life if it ends their suffering and if they are completely aware of their medical condition.
1.2.13. Pro: People have a right to choose how they want to live, this also includes the right to not live if they so want to
1.2.13.1. Pro: Many struggles with mental and physical problems/disabilities, living can therefor be unbearable for those individuals, so forcing them to live would be inhumane
1.2.13.2. Pro: Forcing people to stay alive who don't want to live is a drain on the societys welfare budget/resources, especially if they are unable or refuse to work.
1.2.14. Pro: Suicide can be seen as an expression of the right of self-determination and, for example, is treated as such in German law \([Magnus, p. 600](https://books.google.de/books?id=rmP4p-h-X0YC&pg=PA600&lpg=PA600&dq=self-determination+and+suicide+german+law&source=bl&ots=wGjtQbDexT&sig=WAa4Q0nh6c2KFau1LV2n2lqKbjQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjrx-PP9O7SAhXC8ywKHfbmA0QQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&q=self-determination%20and%20suicide%20german%20law&f=false)\).
1.2.15. Pro: People who are ill may feel a lack of control over their bodies and circumstances \([Rodríguez-Prat et al., p. 15](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0151435&type=printable)\). This gives them back some of that control by ensuring that they do not have to suffer longer than they want to.
1.2.15.1. Pro: Suffering from painful terminal illnesses usually means there will be a slow decline of life quality before eventual death. People should be able to determine for themselves when their life quality is no longer good enough to justify remaining alive.
1.2.15.2. Con: Being terminally ill puts a great deal of mental and emotional strain on someone, such that they may not have the mental clarity to realise full control.
1.2.15.3. Pro: Even if very few people end up actually choosing to die, the knowledge that it is always an option for an individual if their suffering worsens or their condition deteriorates can provide them with confidence and remove fear about the future.
1.3. Con: Legalisation of the right to die would lead to many people choosing to die imprudently.
1.3.1. Pro: Individuals who feel like they are a "drain on society", such as the elderly, the ill and the disabled, may feel that there is social pressure on them to choose euthanasia.
1.3.1.1. Pro: It could potentially become a trend that society expects elders to kill themselves because it could become a method of population control or a way to dictate resource consumption.
1.3.1.2. Pro: There is evidence that the elderly already [believe](http://www.dmu.ac.uk/research/research-news/2013/june/elderly-feel-ignored,-finds-dmu-research.aspx) that society views them as a burden. Rhetoric which speaks [apocalyptically](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/why-an-ageing-population-is-the-greatest-threat-to-society-5361944.html) about the notion of an "aging population" or which [demonizes](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2016/03/29/stubborn-old-people-who-want-to-leave-the-eu-are-condemning-the/) old people for their politics contributes to these perceptions of society's attitudes.
1.3.1.3. Con: Concern that an elderly relative may opt into euthanasia could encourage people to engage with the elderly and make them feel valuable.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: I am nearing 70, widowed, no children, & have several health issues, so have spent considerable time researching & thinking about this over the past  5 few years.  I believe that without my intervention, our society would spend thousands on my healthcare without any care of the quality of life I may have. Reflecting that belief, I have a strict Advanced Directive for palliative care only and know that I may need to consider suicide to prevent an unacceptable quality of life. Quality/Quantity?
1.3.1.4. Pro: The [Oregon experiment](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/4736927/Right-to-die-can-become-a-duty-to-die.html) showed that for people who are scared of becoming a burden, a right to die can feel more like a duty to die.
1.3.2. Pro: The treatment of death as a legitimate response to pain is likely to encourage the idea that it's an appropriate response to a number of situations.
1.3.2.1. Con: Many people in society lead very bad lives for many different reasons, and many of these lives are worse than death. Even if more people choose to die, that does not imply that these people are making the wrong decision.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Choosing to die is never rational.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Technological progress is rapid and unpredictable. Cures to diseases, radical economic improvements, or effective medication for depression and other mental illnesses and disabilities may be just around the corner.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: For someone suffering from a severe, untreatable disease today there is little reason to believe that the cure is just around the corner.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Despite decades of research and billions in investments, no cures for diseases such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, Polio, Ebola, Diabetes, Asthma and Alzheimer's have been found yet.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: While there is no cure yet, research within several of these diseases have shown promising results, such as with [Ebola](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/ebola-vaccine-results/en/), and effective treatment for some such as for [HIV](http://www.aidsmap.com/HIV-update-24th-May-2017/page/3141125/) currently exist.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: In the United States, even of promising medicines that go into the clinical trial phase, only [one in ten](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v32/n1/full/nbt.2786.html) ultimately receives FDA approval.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Change in the medical field is slow. For example, the FDA in 2016 approved [merely 22 new drugs](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pharmaceuticals-approvals-idUSKBN14M08R) for the US market.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: That the number of approved drugs were lower one year can be misleading. In the [article](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pharmaceuticals-approvals-idUSKBN14M08R) it is stated that many drugs expected to come out in 2016 were either released already in 2015 or delayed and will likely come out this year.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.3.2. Con: The [article](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pharmaceuticals-approvals-idUSKBN14M08R) also claims that the industry remain upbeat about the hunt for new medicines, given recent advances in fighting cancer and an improved understanding of the genetic basis of other diseases, which has resulted in full development pipelines at many firms.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.4. Con: Even if no cure may be around the corner, medical progress can improve life for those affected by diseases significantly.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: The life expectancy of a 20 year old with HIV increased [by more than 30 years](http://www.healthline.com/health-news/hiv-life-expectancy-for-americans-with-hiv-reaches-parity-121813#1) to an average age of 73 within one and a half decades.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: On average, it takes at least ten years for new medicine to go from discovery to availability on the market \([PhRMA, p.1](http://phrma-docs.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/rd_brochure_022307.pdf)\).
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.6. Pro: Even if a cure is released it may still be too expensive for the patient. For example [Spinraza](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pharmaceuticals-approvals-idUSKBN14M08R), the first medicine to treat patients with spinal muscular atrophy, a rare and often fatal genetic disease, comes at a huge cost of $125,000 per dose.
1.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Cures are not "just around the corner" on the timescale of someone suffering from a severe disease; cures are a predictable time away, down a pipeline of clinical trials \(and may still fail\). That's years. For someone whose illness may kill them in 6 months \(but they want to go now\), that's useless; for people living in excruciating pain, it may be unthinkable to endure for that long.
1.3.2.1.1.1.3. Con: Radically negative developments in quality of life, like severe recessions or wars, are similarly unpredictable. As such, the aggregate of all unpredictable events is unlikely to be positive.
1.3.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con: There is a [general and robust decline in violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature) over time. Statistically, the individual is less affected by wars, genocides or homicides in future than today.
1.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: We change substantially [as persons](https://qz.com/914002/youre-a-completely-different-person-at-14-and-77-the-longest-running-personality-study-ever-has-found/) over our lives. Even if our current self believes life is not worth living, our future self - with different wants, desires, and material circumstances - is likely to feel otherwise.
1.3.2.1.1.2.1. Con: There is a point at which personality is fully developed \([Caspi & Roberts, p. 302](http://www.rc.usf.edu/~jdorio/Personality/PERSONALITY%20CONTINUITY%20AND%20CHANGE%20ACROSS%20THE%20LIFE%20COURSE.pdf)\). Beyond that, personality does not change much.
1.3.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Personalities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19534589) are formed through childhood experiences and do stay similar over the course of life.
1.3.2.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: The "range of changeability" of personality \(the extent to which someone's personally could change in future\) declines as people grow older \([Caspi & Roberts, p.304](http://www.rc.usf.edu/~jdorio/Personality/PERSONALITY%20CONTINUITY%20AND%20CHANGE%20ACROSS%20THE%20LIFE%20COURSE.pdf)\)
1.3.2.1.1.2.1.3. Con: Personality may not change anymore, but the environment around you and the situation you are in obviously influence your will to die
1.3.2.1.1.2.2. Con: This does not apply to the terminally ill, or the elderly, who do not have much time left for their personality to change dramatically.
1.3.2.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: The needs of the terminally ill and the elderly are especially significant because they have more opportunities to avail themselves of the right to die.
1.3.2.1.1.2.3. Con: The prospect of a future change of heart does not deprive oneself from certain rights in the present.
1.3.2.1.1.2.4. Con: It is not necessarily true that in the future they are likely to feel otherwise. Without a crystal ball we can only make our best guesses as to how the future will unfold  and in some cases it is perfectly reasonable to expect continued suffering and misfortune. Therefore in some cases it may be more likely that they will not feel differently about suicide.
1.3.2.1.1.2.5. Pro: Not only do we change substantially, but we [drastically underestimate](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-sapolsky-end-history-llusion-20170101-story.html) the extent to which we will change in the future, and are therefore incapable of taking this into account in our decisionmaking.
1.3.2.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.
1.3.2.1.1.4. Con: The individual decision maker, who possesses all the information about their unique situation, is best placed to evaluate their future prospects and we should trust them to make this decision.
1.3.2.1.1.4.1. Con: Many people are irrationally shortsighted - choosing to party rather than study, eat unhealthily, or smoke. They cannot be relied upon to protect their future wellbeing.
1.3.2.1.1.4.1.1. Con: The purpose of a human being is nuanced and uncertain and what is best for an individual can therefore not be confined to what is best for their future self.
1.3.2.1.1.4.1.2. Con: There is no certainty of which choice will make us happier in cases like choosing studies or partying and we may come to regret missing out on either one of those choices.
1.3.2.1.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.2.
1.3.2.1.1.5. Con: Humans do not act purely based on logic; emotions determine what seems rational to humans. It can therefore be rational to feel like dying and to act upon this desire \([McDermott, p. 699f.](http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/McDermott/papers/rationality2004.pdf)\).
1.3.2.1.1.5.1. Con: At the same time, the kind of emotional state that leads a person to want to commit suicide is a circumstance that should be questioned as a basis for "rational" decision-making.
1.3.2.1.1.6. Con: There are plenty of examples where the decision to die is a perfectly rational one.
1.3.2.1.1.6.1. Pro: The Japanese act of Seppuku - suicide by disembowelment - has been [described as rational](https://historyofmedievalsuicide.wordpress.com/2017/04/27/heroic-death-the-case-of-seppuku/) in its historical context. It served various purposes and was perceived as honorable.
1.3.2.1.1.6.2. Pro: Choosing to die through a suicide attack is rational for individuals who either believe in rewards for this act in the hereafter or benefits resulting from this act for family, community or a larger cause \([Berman/Laitin, p. 13](http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~elib/Hardtargets.pdf)\).
1.3.2.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Depending on whether one perceives an act as suicide terrorism or martyrdom for a greater cause, the rationale attributed to this act changes \([Fierke, p. 170f.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S1752971909000049)\).
1.3.2.1.1.6.3. Pro: If a person's life is full of misery and suffering, it can be rational to prefer to die.
1.3.2.1.1.6.3.1. Pro: If a person is terminally ill or clinically depressed, the probability that their situation improves may be [very low](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17157758), and their prospects  are overall negative; a high probability of extended suffering outweighs a small probability of improvement.
1.3.2.1.1.6.3.2. Con: This argument depends on the \(unproven\) assumption that misery and suffering is worse that death.
1.3.2.1.1.6.4. Con: Individual perceptions of rationality are generally less rational than objective standards of decision making as seen from the perspective of broader society. Relying on individual's assessments runs the danger of labelling irrational acts as rational.
1.3.2.1.1.6.4.1. Con: Individuals take general perceptions into account in case of decision making. Managers, for example, do rather act based on organizational influence rather than personal bias \([Carroll, p. 130](http://www.jstor.org.proxy.mah.se/stable/4165500?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=evaluations&searchText=of&searchText=risk:&searchText=do&searchText=individual&searchText=bias&searchText=prevail&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3Fgroup%3Dnone%26amp%3BQuery%3Devaluations%2Bof%2Brisk%253A%2Bdo%2Bindividual%2Bbias%2Bprevail%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff&refreqid=search%3Ad5205f6671a2317f114717027b6c0046&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\).
1.3.2.1.1.6.4.2. Pro: When making decisions in difficult situations the [individual](http://www.jstor.org/stable/41761082?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=individual&searchText=bias&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3Facc%3Doff%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3BQuery%3Dindividual%2Bbias&refreqid=search%3A18285fb3975bda3119e402093970d3f0&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) does not rely sufficiently on aggregate societal information.
1.3.2.1.1.6.5. Pro: Sacrificing one's life to save a child's is perfectly rational. It is a flawed argument to assume self-preservation is the highest priority of a rational individual.
1.3.2.1.1.6.6. Pro: It is rational to choose to die for a person who is no longer beneficial and maintaining him alive drains scarce resources that could save another lives.
1.3.2.1.1.7. Con: -> See 1.2.4.3.1.3.3.
1.3.2.1.1.8. Pro: Life is irrational. To live is to suffer pain, suffer disease, suffer injury. Yet without these detractors, one could say they never lived at all.
1.3.2.1.1.9. Con: One cannot talk about what is rational until one understands the wants and desires of an agent. What agents want to do, and whether society should allow it, is the topic of rights; not the perception of whether it is or can be rational.
1.3.2.1.1.10. Con: Preventing all irrationality is not and should not be role of the government.
1.3.2.1.1.11. Con: Desiring prolonged periods of pain is not rational, given much of our mental and physical functions are designed to help up avoid it. Desiring death as a relief from pain could be considered rational.
1.3.2.1.1.12. Con: Society or government rarely involves itself with questions of rationality. And evidence would be needed to show that it is the fundamental role of either, if such is your claim.
Certain foods and lifestyle habits are less-healthy and therefore less-rational, yet we do not have preventions against those.
1.3.2.1.1.13. Con: Forcing someone to live against their will is irrational.
1.3.2.1.1.14. Pro: Losing your will to live is losing your rationality. No one can rationally and without great influence from their emotions choose to end their life. Despair is not a free choice.
1.3.2.1.1.15. Pro: You don't want to end your life if everything is OK, you could likely make this decision because something is wrong, [possibly excessive sadness](https://www.healthline.com/health/suicide-and-suicidal-behavior#Signs&Symptoms2) \(considered as mental disorder, see [Melancholia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melancholia) and [Melancholic depression](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/melancholic-depression#Treatments4)\), or [social causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_\(book\)). Either way, there is a reason behind suicidal thoughts, and a rational decision about it is not likely \(incurable disease aside\). Thus, making assisted suicide legal is denying the possibility of healing the subject, turning the procedure into a legal murder.
1.3.2.1.1.16. Con: Rationality can mean many different things: Economic rationality \(to earn as much as possible\), philosophical rationality \(to be logical and consistent in beliefs\), epistemological rationality, etc etc. For one to say that choosing to die is never rational, they need to give a more complete argument for what they mean.
1.3.2.1.1.17. Con: Emotional processes actually favor more adaptative decisions, which is why we have them in the first place, we evolved into it. \(see Ekman's theory of emotions\). Emotions affect our decisions. Also, they are spontaneous: we do not control them on a conscious or rational level. On this basis, one could say that purely rational decisions is not possible in human beings.
1.3.2.1.1.18. Con: Although not enumerated in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 5, “the right to die”. This article prohibits torture and inhuman treatment and asserts a right to relief of suffering at end of life. Thus, we find legal, rational support in many jurisdictions for people suffering from terminal illness. Under terminal conditions, such as those qualified for Hospice care, rational suicide should be an alternative as a final palliative measure. Source: p. 12 [www.un.org](http://www.un.org/en/udhrbook/pdf/udhr_booklet_en_web.pdf)
1.3.2.2. Pro: The possibility of a convenient and comfortable way to die at a preferred place could lower the motivational threshold required to commit suicide.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: There is an expectation gap because more than 50% of people desire to die at home but in reality only 19% do \([NCPC, p.1](http://www.ncpc.org.uk/sites/default/files/NCPC_Future_Forum_Evidence_May_2011.pdf)\). The desire to die at the place of choice is motivating self-determined death.
1.3.2.3. Pro: There is a danger that non-lethal sicknesses or difficult times encourage a decision to die; people with these conditions would then choose to die, which is bad.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: A [transsexual](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2440086/Belgian-transsexual-Nathan-Verhelst-44-elects-die-euthanasia-botched-sex-change-operation.html) Belgian requested euthanasia after his gender reassignment surgery went wrong.
1.3.2.3.2. Pro: Where a right to die exists it has been used in cases of non-terminal illnesses, for example in the case of a [24 year-old](http://lawstreetmedia.com/news/healthy-woman-qualifies-euthanasia-belgium-procedure-legal/) who desired euthanasia because of her depression.
1.3.2.3.2.1. Con: That is not accurate.  All current right to die laws allow it only in the case of a physician determined terminal illness.
1.3.2.3.3. Pro: Suicides amidst [financial crisis](http://www.forbes.com/sites/melaniehaiken/2014/06/12/more-than-10000-suicides-tied-to-economic-crisis-study-says/) illustrate the ease by which temporary problems can lead to permanent decisions to die.
1.3.2.4. Pro: A right to die will devalue those who have a particular disease but decide to stay alive.
1.3.2.4.1. Con: To the contrary, it will make it clear to everyone that their lives are valuable. The fact that they had the option to die and still chose to continue living illustrates the extent to which they derive value from living.
1.3.2.5. Pro: A lot of people kill themselves after they [retire](http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2014/06/30/the-secret-sadness-of-retired-men) because they have no more [tasks](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1581875) in life.
1.3.2.5.1. Con: This problem could easily be rectified by the provision of services to engage the elderly in activities.
1.3.2.6. Pro: People who live in poverty or are oppressed may feel that their lives will never improve and see death as an appropriate solution to this.
1.3.2.6.1. Con: [Suicide rates](http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-statistics.html) in rich countries are generally higher than in poor countries. Poverty, therefore, is not a good predictor of a desire to commit suicide.
1.3.3. Con: Legalisation would involve the implementation of stricter procedures to check the decisionmaking capabilities of people considering death.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Simply by lengthening the process between an individual deciding that they want to die and actually carrying out the action, we are likely to prevent people from committing suicide on the basis of fleeting irrational sentiments.
1.3.3.2. Pro: In the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia_in_the_Netherlands) the legalization of euthanasia came along with mandatory consultation procedures.
1.3.3.3. Con: Checking the decisionmaking is, to some extent, a restriction to free will.
1.3.4. Pro: It is impossible to determine the point where life is worth living. A right to die would exert a downward pressure on society's calculation of where this point is located, resulting in many people choosing to die unnecessarily.
1.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.4.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Because we would observe many seemingly rational people committing suicide, perceptions would gradually shift towards deeming more and more lives not worth living, which would encourage many people to commit suicide whose lives are actually worth living.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Many of these people will be well-off, in the sense of having high socioeconomic [status](http://business.time.com/2012/11/08/why-suicides-are-more-common-in-richer-neighborhoods/), but since we are not able to observe internal problems like mental illness, we will not be able to fully understand why they made their choice.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: At the moment, there are strong social taboos against suicide, which means that many people irrationally choose to continue living very miserable lives. Even if some people irrationally choose to die under this policy, this would be outweighed by many other people who rationally choose to die.
1.3.5. Pro: People are prone to periods of irrational pessimism, and systematically [underestimate](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/science/study-in-science-shows-end-of-history-illusion.html) the extent to which they will change in the future.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Especially in their teenage years, a lot of people suffer from teenage depression, because of changes in their hormone levels. Later on in life those people might not want to kill themselves.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: Comparably, teenagers have an extremely [low suicide rate](https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/). This indicates that problems during adolescence do not result in a drive to die.
1.3.5.2. Pro: For individuals who are capable of returning to a healthy, quality lifestyle, providing this option can prohibit their progression. This is especially true in cases of mental illness.
1.3.5.3. Pro: Extreme stress can cause irrational thinking, creating impulses and desires that seem justified at the time.
1.3.5.4. Pro: It is a rush of emotions rather a rational decision. Many people that tried to commit suicide and failed after described it as such and regreted the attempt. Ex[many suicides are based on an impulsive decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/many-suicides-are-based-on-an-impulsive-decision-2014-8).
1.3.5.5. Pro: When people go through something that is initially very painful, such as heartbreak or loss of a loved one, it can be hard to see past that pain to a point where things improve, even though they are likely to. It is situations like these where people may consider death an option even when ultimately it is not the best decision.
1.3.6. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.2.
1.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.
1.3.8. Pro: People might offer themselves up to be cannibalized.
1.3.8.1. Con: Well, at least the cannibals are fed, bodies aren't going to waste, and the number of victims is reduced.
1.3.9. Con: Punitive action is not a motivating factor for people who do not believe they will experience the punishment.
1.3.10. Con: Research suggests that the impaired decision making of depression, a[leading cause of suicide](http://www.suicide.org/suicide-causes.html), is [not aided by punishment or threats thereof](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3566413/).
1.3.11. Pro: Euthanasia must be linked to critical degenerative diseases and chronic systemic failure of bodily functions illustrating that the suffering has no future nor reprieve from suffering because of abnormal physiological conditions that cannot be corrected.
1.3.11.1. Con: Apart from physical pain, there is also psychological pain that can be just as persistent and debilitating. Saying you can only end your life due to physiological pain, marginalizes and trivializes the mental pain \(depression, anxiety, despair\) that either accompany or are the sole reason for suicidal thoughts.
1.3.12. Con: Prudency is a moralistic claim and freedom of religion was intended to hinder the government enforcing majority ethics on minority groups choosing freedom of belief.
1.3.13. Pro: Allowing too broad a choice of ways to die could open the possibility of people choosing intentionally spiteful, or emotionally manipulative ways to die.
1.3.14. Con: Even if a lot of people died by irrational thoughts, it would still be their choice. People make irrational decisions all the time and they often influence their life more than how they can imagine, but those are not illegal.
1.3.15. Con: This is begging the question. You're presupposing that an external "good or bad" dichotomy exists over whether people should live or die. 
You need supporting evidence that it is an external authority's right to determine what is "prudent".
1.3.16. Pro: The implications of legal assisted death will tend to put the most vulnerable at risk of unwanted death because assisted death is cheaper than keeping the chronically ill alive.
1.3.17. Con: Oregon's physician assisted suicide program issues more prescriptions each year than are actually used, showing that not everyone will utilize suicide if it is a legal option. Many just want the comfort of knowing they are in control of their life.
1.3.18. Con: The right to die will require means, processes procedures. Systems could try to reverse the decision. For example if after a request to die, the actual execution of the request will take months, help can be provided in forms of theraphy and education. In the end, it could reduce the number of suicidal deaths.
1.3.19. Con: This assumes that it is easy to commit suicide.  It takes a lot of courage to kill anyone, including oneself.
1.3.20. Con: It is entirely possible that the exact opposite would occur. Legislation would slow the process somewhat, meaning that anybody that completed the entire process would have had time to reflect on what it was they were choosing to do. In other words, legislating the right to die would likely remove many "impulsive" suicides from the current statistics.
1.3.21. Pro: The law is safer turning a blind eye to assisted suicide, rather than making the right to die enshrined in law and enforceable under increasing circumstances which would result in death.
1.4. Pro: The state has no right to interfere with an individual's decision to die.
1.4.1. Con: The state has a license to interfere with individual decisions when those decisions have substantial negative impacts on others. Decisions to die do have these negative impacts.
1.4.1.1. Con: If death is planned for in advance, organs can be harvested and [donated](http://www.tc.umn.edu/~parkx032/CY-OD-VD.html).
1.4.1.1.1. Con: As [many](https://www.bioedge.org/bioethics/everybodys-a-winner-when-euthanasia-combines-with-organ-donation-say-d1/11814) as 70-75% of those who are eligible for euthanasia in Belgium and the Netherlands have conditions that make them ineligible to be organ donors.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: A case in [Belgium](http://www.coma.ulg.ac.be/papers/death/organ_euthanasia09.pdf) showed that harvesting organs from euthanasia patients is possible.
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: Organ donation procedures can be simplified and planned ahead to the benefit of those directly involved.
1.4.1.1.3.1. Con: Most of these procedures, such as gaining consent, can be made when it is discovered that a patient is terminally ill. Knowing the exact date of death is unnecessary.
1.4.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Often the fundamental decision to make use of a right to die is done [before](https://academic.oup.com/annonc/article/24/6/1639/180484/Families-experiences-with-patients-who-died-after) the illness.
1.4.1.1.3.2. Con: For this to be the case, humans simply having the right to die is not sufficient. Indeed, in Belgium and the Netherlands, there remain significant [barriers](https://www.bioedge.org/bioethics/everybodys-a-winner-when-euthanasia-combines-with-organ-donation-say-d1/11814) to linking up euthanasia and organ donation.
1.4.1.1.3.3. Pro: Likely recipients of donated organs can be identified in advance, e.g. matching blood and tissue types.
1.4.1.1.3.4. Pro: Donors are personally agreeing in advance. This simplifies bureaucratic procedures.
1.4.1.1.3.5. Pro: Doctors can schedule their other surgeries and duties accordingly.
1.4.1.1.3.6. Pro: Organs could be stored more efficiently by cutting-off the blood supply to the donor's brain, causing obvious brain-death. Blood-circulation to the rest of the donor's body could be maintained to keep organs fresh.
1.4.1.2. Con: The system of care for the elderly could be unburdened when those in need of care could choose, at a certain point, whether life was still worth living.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: The negative effects that this cause on the [elderly](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/elder/9096635/Elderly-ignored-and-treated-as-objects-in-care-system.html), outweighs any monetary gain from this. They already feel [ignored](http://www.dmu.ac.uk/research/research-news/2013/june/elderly-feel-ignored,-finds-dmu-research.aspx) and become [lonely](https://www.agingcare.com/articles/loneliness-in-the-elderly-151549.htm) because there's not enough attention paid to them. Pressure on the elderly to choose to die would increase with this provision and there would be less efforts from society to improve their life situations.
1.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Treatment costs during the last two months of terminally ill people's lives amounts to [$55 billion](http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2010/12/cost-keeping-terminally-ill-alive.html) per year in America, and it is estimated that 20 to 30% of this money leads to no quality of life improvements.
1.4.1.3. Con: There are already too many [people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation) living on this planet. This provision would enhance the death rate and thus should be welcomed.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: In addition to the population crisis, many countries are facing [a](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chinas-population-destiny-the-looming-crisis/) [demographic](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/08/east-asia-could-be-in-trouble-due-to-aging-population-world-bank-says.html) [crisis](https://www.ft.com/content/df61dc42-99fa-11e6-8f9b-70e3cabccfae) due to an aging population. A right to die would primarily reduce the number of old people in the world.
1.4.1.3.2. Con: Increasing the death rate is not the only way to deal with the effects of overpopulation. Measures such as more efficient resource usage, less consumption, more compact urbanization, and lower birth rates would achieve the same effect.
1.4.1.3.3. Con: The impact of this provision on the death rate would be insignificant and thus it should not be considered a relevant benefit.
1.4.1.3.3.1. Pro: Evidence suggests that there are no significant numbers of voluntary deaths with a legal right to die.
1.4.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: In Belgium there are less than [2000](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/17/euthanasia-assisted-suicide-laws-world) cases per year.
1.4.1.3.3.1.2. Con: The number of voluntary deaths tripled in the [Netherlands](http://www.newsweek.com/2015/02/20/choosing-die-netherlands-euthanasia-debate-306223.html) reaching 4800 in 2013.
1.4.1.3.4. Pro: The right to die would help to decrease the population and and help our population stay under the carrying capacity
1.4.1.4. Pro: The death of someone close to you can cause intense feelings of grief and sadness. If significant numbers of people choose to die then significantly more people will be left feeling this way.
1.4.1.4.1. Con: It is immoral to demand that one extend their life of pain and suffering simply to alleviate potential future pain from others.
1.4.1.4.1.1. Con: It is egoistic to not care about the effect of one's decision on others. There is no 'demand' to extend a life but rather a consideration of several effects.
1.4.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.3.3.1.
1.4.1.4.3. Pro: Grief can cause people to be emotionally unstable, frequently exhausted and distracted. This is likely to impact their ability to work and lead normal lives, at least for a period of time.
1.4.1.4.3.1. Con: People that want to die, usually, are in deep grief and can't/don't want to/won't manage to get better. Forcing them to live will only increase that grief, and their relatives'.
1.4.1.4.4. Con: If individuals are forced to endure extended periods of pain and suffering, this could cause a similar, and longer, emotional strain on their family and friends.
1.4.1.4.4.1. Pro: Death provides closure and an ability to begin moving past grief. An extended period of suffering delays that opportunity for closure.
1.4.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.4.1.6. Con: The state only has a right to intervene to protect individuals directly harming each other. If the state could interfere with people's actions whenever they indirectly negatively affected others, this would completely invalidate the [harm principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_principle), and license any state action which maximises the utilitarian good.
1.4.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.4.2. Pro: The decision to continue living, or stop living, is a fundamentally personal one, and not the business of the government.
1.4.2.1. Pro: To suggest otherwise would seem to imply that we are inexorably bound to a "duty to live", such a viewpoint almost invariably being based on some belief system or other.
1.4.2.2. Pro: We can never know what value others place on their life. it is a personal thing and for some people life is not valuable, not something they have chosen and they would rather move on. We have no right to say that their perspective is wrong and to impose our own value of life onto them?
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Thinking in terms of a suicidal person who believes that their life shouldn't have existed in the first place, they are thinking that the use of food, fuel, and resources on themselves is a waste. The only reason they haven't taken their own life is because it is frowned upon in society. Making it easier would alleviate allot of peoples pain.
1.4.2.3. Con: The core of sovereignty is rooted in a right to exist. This does not imply a right to not exist.
1.4.2.4. Con: There is a strong correlation between modernization and the rate of suicide according to [Durkheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_\(book\)). This indicates suicide is not an individual decision, but a social phenomenon.
1.4.2.4.1. Con: A correlation between suicide and modernization is compatible with suicide being an individual decision. Even if modernization changes people's circumstances such that they are more likely to commit suicide, this does not mean that within those circumstances they are not making a free individual choice.
1.4.2.4.2. Pro: A higher degree of urbanization leads to more social isolation and thus to more suicide. A landmark study on [Finland](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1389426?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) showed this link.
1.4.2.4.3. Con: [Halbwachs](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/The_Causes_of_Suicide.html?id=G_wYAAAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y) asserted that there are clear internal mechanisms that strongly influence decisions to commit suicide.
1.4.2.4.3.1. Con: But even Halbwachs acknowledged that societal modernization has a strong influence, e.g. by creating the preconditions for individuals to isolate themselves \([Travis, p.227](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2386880)\). And here the state cannot sit idle but has to work against it.
1.4.2.5. Con: It is indicative that suicide rates affect men differently than women. In this case it is not a solely personal matter anymore but a question of gender equality and should be addressed by the government.
1.4.2.5.1. Con: This does not imply that it's not a personal matter. It could instead indicate different genders face a different set of social and life circumstances. That is perfectly compatible with suicide remaining a free choice.
1.4.2.5.2. Pro: In [South Korea](http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/656650.html) for example, the suicide rate among elderly men is as high as 110 per 100,000 while the one of women stands at 35 for the same age period.
1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.4.4. Pro: Free and informed actions, taken by a mentally fit individual, does not warrant state interference, unless that action negatively impacts a third party.
1.4.4.1. Pro: People can receive support in thinking through the decision through talks with therapists. This could let the state ensure that the individual is mentally fit enough to make a free and informed decision to die.
1.4.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.4.5. Pro: Because an individual who has chosen to die has removed themselves from the threat of punishment, the state has no capacity to enforce a prohibition against suicide. Thus, for the state to deny someone the right to death is meaningless.
1.4.5.1. Con: The state can, however, arguably enforce this prohibition in advance. Hence, the concern of the state to [ensure](http://jaapl.org/content/34/2/165) that death row inmates do not kill themselves and to disrupt hunger strikes.
1.4.5.2. Con: By the same token, one could [argue](https://caringlabor.wordpress.com/2010/08/06/michel-foucault-right-of-death-and-power-over-life/) that a state which allows suicide is undermining the source of its own power.
1.4.6. Pro: If you have the right to life, you therefore have a right to die. If you do not have that right, you have an obligation to live, not the right to life.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Having a right to something implies having ownership of that thing, which in turn implies having the right to do whatever you want with it.
1.4.7. Pro: People die every day outside the state's control. It's not the state's responsibility to mitigate the pain of loss, no matter how it comes. A rational decision to die would include planning to mitigate the level of disruption in the individual's circle.
1.4.8. Con: The state should confirm if the person has a debt on society. For example, a person lived on grants and subsidies for a prolonged time and then, when it's that person's time to contribute, he/she decides to die with no justifiable reason. Not fair for society.
1.4.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.4.8.2. Con: Holding a person's rights hostage over financial debts is immoral.
1.5. Pro: Having a right to die brings about benefits for individuals as well as their families.
1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.5.2. Pro: Terminally ill patients who experience considerable suffering and degradation should be allowed to bring that suffering to an end by ending their lives.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Advancements in medical technology have stretched out the time that it takes a person to die. This often results in a long period of suffering, due to pain, degrading conditions, and loss of personal autonomy. Choosing to avoid this fate is a legitimate decision.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Very invasive surgeries are often futile and cause [more pain](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2100684/Why-doctors-like-die-endure-pain-treatment-advanced-cancer.html) to the patient.
1.5.2.1.2. Pro: Many [doctors](http://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2011/11/30/how-doctors-die/ideas/nexus/) wouldn't choose 'life-saving' measures themselves, precisely because they possess intimate knowledge of the nature of those measures and the unnecessary suffering they cause.
1.5.2.1.3. Pro: [Massive quantities](http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2010/12/cost-keeping-terminally-ill-alive.html) of health resources are wasted on extending people's lives in essentially futile ways. These resources could be far more effective if used elsewhere.
1.5.2.1.4. Con: Individuals currently have the choice to refuse medical treatment, meaning their lives do not have to be prolonged in this way if it is against their wishes.
1.5.2.1.4.1. Con: At the moment, there is a social [aversion](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/07/17/who-by-very-slow-decay/) to taking people off of life support, and a default assumption that life should be extended for as long as possible. If we eliminate this, it will be easier for people to choose to die.
1.5.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Just passing legislation to allow euthanasia is not sufficient to remove these social aversions.
1.5.2.1.4.1.2. Con: If people are suffering through a debilitating and degrading illness, then the comparatively weak force of social norms will not stop them from choosing to die.
1.5.2.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.5.2.1.5. Con: Advancements in medical technology also enhance our ability to alleviate pain and mitigate the debilitating effects of many illnesses.
1.5.3. Con: The right to die will reduce access to life-prolonging treatment and palliative care by encouraging many to die before their time.
1.5.4. Con: The right to die could reduce the amount of respect and dignity that patients receive from the general population in their final months or years, as well as disabled people could receive across their lives.

People with mental illnesses, disabilities or terminal illnesses who choose not to die could be seen as less valuable than other humans.
1.5.5. Pro: Bringing this decision into public knowledge, gives society and family the ability to turn-around the decision. In the end, suicide levels might be reduced.
1.5.5.1. Con: It is not clear that legalising the right to die will mean that people who want to commit suicide will discuss it more with their families or people around them.
1.5.6. Pro: If someone is so hopeless in their own life that they wish to terminate it, they are obviously not living anyways.  It is empathetic and compassionate \(humane?\) to allow them to do it with dignity and respect.
1.5.7. Pro: We need to start allowing the same painless, respectful death we allow our animals to ourselves. The is no reason to keep someone in pain if their own choice is to end this pain once and for all.
1.5.8. Pro: Since the advent of the health insurance machine, peoples normal life span has been artificially extended past what most would consider living. This unnatural extension of life is unjust and unethical. It exploits emotions by giving unrealistic hope for recovery. It is unfair to families often left with a tremendous financial burden do to medical costs. A person should be able to decide when life as they define it, has been completed.
1.5.8.1. Pro: As people live longer, the likelyhood of them having more pain then happiness increases. Already, dying by old age or terminal ilnesses is far worse than most think, and you don't have to be a utilitarian to find the amount of suffering in death appalling.  As peoples lifespans increases, we should give them both the freedom to live as long as they want, but also give them the option to die mercifully and on their own terms. relevant reading: [slatestarcodex.com](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/07/17/who-by-very-slow-decay/)
1.5.9. Pro: The financial burden that healthcare places on the family of the individual may be reduced.
1.5.9.1. Pro: Many adult children have made [financial sacrifices](http://www.post-gazette.com/business/finance/2014/09/19/Cost-of-care-for-adult-relatives-often-falls-on-younger-generations/stories/201409180114) to cover care-giving expenses.
1.5.9.2. Pro: [68%](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2081497-women-live-longer-than-men-but-suffer-more-years-of-poor-health/) of women above the age of 65 require daily assistance due to health issues.
1.5.10. Pro: Being able to make decisions about and plan one's own death can provide psychological comfort to the elderly.
1.5.10.1. Con: The expectation that they will plan an especially fulfilling or significant death may instead impose additional psychological pressure and stress on the elderly.
1.5.10.2. Pro: Knowing that they have the option of dying at any point, people will be far less distressed at the news that they have a terminal illness like cancer; their increased ability to cope with the news will also mean distress is less likely to spread to family members.
1.5.10.3. Pro: The option of a quick and pain-free death instead of a suffering lasting for months is a [wish of many](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/17/assisted-dying-bill-lords-palliative-care-dignity-doctors). Having this option can cause a comforting effect for the affected individuals.
1.5.10.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.5.10.4. Pro: Many old people have the wish [to die at home](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2358685/Let-sick-elderly-choose-want-die-says-care-home-boss.html). Having the right to die eases that, as people can decide when and therefore often where they want to pass away.
1.5.10.4.1. Pro: In the [Netherlands](http://www.dyingforchoice.com/resources/fact-files/netherlands-2015-euthanasia-report-card), euthanasia is mostly administered at home.
1.5.10.4.2. Pro: Under the status quo, guaranteeing death at home requires people to go home, detach themselves from medical treatment, and wait to die naturally; this is an ordeal that can involve substantial extended suffering.
1.5.11. Con: People without caring families or friends could be encouraged to choose death, whether because of malicious intentions or just neglect and callousness.
1.5.11.1. Con: People can already be encouraged to undergo passive euthanasia under the status quo; it is unclear why the move to active euthanasia would substantially exacerbate the problem.
1.5.11.1.1. Con: Many countries, [including Germany](http://www.dw.com/en/germany-seeks-to-clarify-euthanasia-laws/a-16150555), have extensive legal restrictions on passive euthanasia under the status quo, reducing the likelihood that people could be coerced into it.
1.5.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.5.11.3. Pro: 56% of euthanasia cases in the Netherlands are linked to [social isolation](http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2016/02/18/most-euthanasia-deaths-linked-to-loneliness-says-dutch-study/).
1.5.11.4. Con: Regulation could be enacted that requires physiological consultation to ensure that the person was acting without social duress.
1.5.11.5. Pro: [Families](http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2015/07/pressure-on-patients-is-cause-for-concern-euthanasia-expert/) that do not want to continue emotionally and financially caring for someone may put pressure on that individual to choose death.
1.5.11.5.1. Pro: If terminally ill or elderly people have family members who require organ transplants, they could be pressured to choose death prematurely so as to be able to donate their organs.
1.5.12. Con: Family and friends will no longer be able to see and be with the deceased loved one, causing a lot of distress.
1.5.12.1. Con: Being forced to watch a loved one endure an extended period of pain and humiliation would be emotionally damaging to the family of the individual as well.
1.5.12.1.1. Pro: Morale would be significantly impacted for others in contact with those choosing to die.
1.5.12.2. Con: It is easier for individuals to arrange for final good-byes with loved ones if they know exactly when they are going to die.
1.5.12.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.
1.5.12.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.
1.5.12.2.3. Pro: A right to die greatly reduces the risk that individuals will die without getting the chance to say goodbye to those most important to them.
1.5.12.2.4. Con: While this may be beneficial for the individual choosing to die, it may be particularly traumatic for their loved ones if they are required to say goodbye at a particular time.
1.5.12.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.5.12.1.
1.5.12.2.4.2. Pro: We are not just ourselves, but a summation of the lives with whom we shared our own. I share my life with my brothers and parents, and theirs with mine. I am also the only person amoung them to not experience dark thoughts. I've been there for them during those times, and I can argue on experience that a person entertaining such thoughts is in a smaller place, than if they were fighting for life. If they had a right to die, I would have lost one by now.
1.5.12.3. Pro: The benefits of having elderly people around, such as wisdom and the provision of more diverse lived experiences, would substantially diminish.
1.5.12.4. Pro: It is selfish of the person deciding to end their life. Life as it is, makes all of as connected of some sort. Therefore, such decision has impact not solely on the person involved but also anyone linked to him directly or indirectly. In short, the suicide of someone can, somehow, sometimes, result in someone else losing their job that supports an entire family.
1.6. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.
1.7. Pro: If a person sees no exit out of the situation that he/she is in then that person should have a "right" to end his/her life.
1.7.1. Con: A sudden lapse in judgement or duress from an outside source could force one to give up their life without this being what they really wanted.
1.7.1.1. Con: The way these euthanasia laws are implemented it can never be a 'sudden lapse in judgement. These requests are seen as a call for help and the trajectory for otherwise reasonably healthy individuals takes a year or longer.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: The process of assisted suicide in Switzerland takes lots of [time and paperwork.](https://www.thelocal.ch/20180503/what-you-need-to-know-about-assisted-death-in-switzerland)
1.7.1.2. Con: This possibility does not mean that the process should not be made legal. Just because someone may be wrong doesn't mean we can assume all or most people are. Humans are free to make that judgement for themselves.
1.7.2. Pro: No person chooses to be born so if they find that experience too painful they should be allowed to end their life if they see fit.
1.7.3. Pro: If someone has battled pain their whole life, the question is "Why do you want to continue their pain?"
1.8. Con: There is no country that punishes suicide. Killing oneself is not illegal. The right to die in this context really means forcing others to kill someone, who is not able to commit suicide or forcing others to help someone to commit suicide. That would take away freedom instead of increasing personal freedom.
1.8.1. Con: Granting the freedom to die on purpose isn't to force anyone to kill, rather it's to prevent interference or punishment by the state if everyone involved gives consent.
1.8.2. Pro: The moment you make it a legal right, you put medical professionals at risk of lawsuits for denying that right because they are not willing to assist you in suicide.
1.8.2.1. Con: Anything legal can include exceptions when the bill is written. We would want to encourage hesitation and the doctor's personal choice/comfort zone by allowing denial of service without consequence in these cases.
1.8.2.2. Con: To the contrary, most assisted dying laws require that the patient's request is approved by 2-3 doctors, and if any of these doctors believe that the request is ill-conceived, euthanasia will not be performed. A doctor's right to refuse to participate in euthanasia altogether, or to deny a person's request to die, are inherent in the process and to my knowledge all countries with assisted dying laws allow doctors to refuse on moral or personal grounds.
1.8.2.3. Con: Committees in hospitals or large health systems can easily be formed from physicians willing to exercise that practice, they would then be requested similar to any consulting service. Situation will be similar to OB/Gyn groups that perform abortions.
1.8.2.4. Pro: Even though, at first, doctors would be allowed to refuse to euthanise patients, once the practice is widely morally accepted it is quite possible that this refusal might not be allowed.
1.8.2.5. Pro: A hospital's health professionals should not have to focus on or consider the responsibility of taking the lives of patients; only how to restore health, and comfort.
1.8.3. Con: In the past, many states had laws that regarded the act of suicide as a felony. Today, many countries consider suicide illegal according to [Suicide legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_legislation).
1.8.4. Con: The attempt is illegal, which keeps it from becoming a dignified choice that could be celebrated, and most importantly - openly planned.
1.8.5. Con: There is no assisted dying law which forces doctors to perform euthanasia. Doctors are allowed to refuse on moral or personal grounds. Moreover, most laws require 2-3 doctors to approve the patient's request to die, and if any of these doctors chooses to deny the patient's request, euthanasia is not performed. Not only are doctors not forced to kill anyone, they are given every chance to refuse to do so.
1.8.6. Con: Legalizing assisted suicide would balance the negative status it currently faces in many societies from people with strong religious sentiment. The requester and whoever volunteers to assist would have more chance to act out their personal freedoms.
1.8.7. Con: If the police believe that someone is going to kill themselves, they have authority to act on that.  There may not be specific laws that make suicide illegal, but in practice it is.  If a person generally wishes to kill themselves, disallowing that is taking away freedom.
1.8.8. Pro: Due to the [Hippocratic Oath](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=20909) all Doctors take, all Doctors must not cause harm to patients and cannot Euthanize. In order to enable a "right to die" law, the result would be non-medical professionals having to Euthanize. Such Euthanasia could be dangerous and painful if done incorrectly by an unqualified person.
1.8.8.1. Con: Only the classic version of the Hippocratic Oath prohibits euthanasia or to "cause harm". Doctors today swear a [modernized Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath#Modern_versions_and_relevance) where none of these principles are mentioned. Therefore, medical professionals would remain responsible of the "right to die".
1.8.8.1.1. Pro: The classic version of the oath also prohibits [abortive medicine](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=20909) to women, which is arguably another outdated concept. To follow the original text blindly would be as "irrational" as taking the Bible or other holy texts word for word, and has no place in modern State/Federal lawmaking.
1.8.8.2. Con: Swearing the Hippocratic Oath is a symbolic rite of passage, and breaking it has no legal consequences, unlike [medical malpractice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_malpractice), which is a concept associated with [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law).
1.8.9. Con: I think I agree with you,  by inviting others the opportunity to end a life personal freedom is removed. The person requesting the end gives their freedom over to someone else to create that end.  I agree except that you are placing 'personal freedom' as the highest attainable goal perhaps = to life.
1.9. Con: The decision to take your life is only yours, since life's is a natural right which you're born with, therefore you can do whatever you want with your own life. But this doesn't mean other's should guarantee you can take your life, you should use your own means to do so.
1.9.1. Con: If I'm granted with the right to choose the time of my death, I should be able to get help in case I need it. No one should be forced to help me, but that doesn't mean helping me should be forbidden or punished.
1.9.2. Con: If a country has the duty to help the people to self-determine themselves, it has the moral obligation to help them in doing this.
1.10. Pro: None of us chose to be born, at least not consciously, and if we find life, our surroundings or some circumstances difficult to cope with, we should have a way out. Some people do not want to live, and I think that it would only be fair to give them this option to do this in a more ''clean'' way instead of traditional suicide which can be really messy and hard for the families. Also, there is already too many of us on this planet, why should we force someone to live if they do not want to.
1.10.1. Con: The fact that we did not choose to be born does not confer a right to die. We still have obligations even when we do not choose, support, or agree with something. We must pay taxes even though we often prefer not to. That's life.
1.10.2. Pro: Considering that lifespans at this very moment may be ever-increasing to the point of out-pacing death, a human should be allowed to opt-out of ever-growing longevity.
1.11. Pro: Public opinion favors euthanasia which suggests some support for a right to die.
1.11.1. Con: When laws concern fundamental rights and ethical concepts like the sanctity of life, the will of the majority should not be taken as decisive. This is precisely why most countries have a strict separation of powers, with the judiciary capable of protecting minorities from majority decisions.
1.11.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.
1.11.3. Pro: Europeans generally [support](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-euthanasia-europe-survey-idUSBRE8AT0EG20121130) euthanasia. For example, more than 70% of citizens of Spain, Germany, France and Britain are in favor.
1.11.4. Pro: In the [US](http://www.gallup.com/poll/171704/seven-americans-back-euthanasia.aspx), support for assisted suicide has risen to 69% acceptance rate in the last few decades.
1.11.5. Con: The young and healthy that are asked in polls cannot imagine a situation of disability. This, so the [criticism](http://www.life.org.nz/euthanasia/euthanasiamediakeyissues/public-opinion-polls/) goes, blurs their image of euthanasia.
1.11.5.1. Con: This argument could be made to defend either position: a person that cannot imagine a state of disability might oppose euthanasia because the severity of disability is in reality worse than it seems to the individual, or on the other hand, a person might be in favor of euthanasia because disability sounds worse to the individual than it is in reality.
1.11.5.2. Con: Those with disabilities favor assisted suicide [more](https://www.dignityindying.org.uk/assisted-dying/public-opinion/) than non-disabled individuals.
1.11.6. Con: Public opinion is unreliable and depends, at least in part, on questionnaire design. For example, two similar [polls](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2649074/) on public approval of euthanasia conducted in 1998 arrived at different support levels with 18% and 41% depending on the question asked.
1.11.7. Pro: Studies have shown that 66% of [New Zealanders](http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/health/2017/01/most-new-zealanders-support-euthanasia-study-suggests.html) support euthanasia.
1.11.8. Pro: Public opinion is a useful proxy for considering how happy or sad people will generally be with a particular policy or decision.
1.12. Con: This would unfairly limit society's ability to punish prisoners by allowing them to choose death over other sentences.
1.12.1. Con: There is no harm in allowing a prisoner to choose death over a prison sentence, since if anything this could be viewed as a greater punishment.
1.12.1.1. Pro: In countries that practice the death penalty, it is reserved for the worst of crimes. This indicates that death is perceived to be the harshest punishment possible.
1.12.1.1.1. Con: The point of the death penalty is dying against one's will under circumstances outside one's control. Giving prisoners the right to die would not be a punishment in this sense.
1.12.1.2. Pro: If inmates were allowed, and chose, to die, it would lessen the collective burden that the penal system places on society.
1.12.1.3. Con: If living in prison is a horrible experience, choosing death could actually be a positive choice for the prisoner, and could be seen as them getting relief from their punishment.
1.12.2. Pro: Judgments by courts are intended to be binding and only amendable by higher courts. Prisoners would symbolically place themselves above the judiciary if they could revise a court order.
1.12.3. Con: Just like prisoners are denied other rights - for example the right to vote in elections - so could they temporarily lose the right to choose death.
1.12.4. Con: -> See 1.4.5.
1.12.5. Con: Imprisoning individuals costs a lot of money that could instead go towards crime prevention/ victim assistance. This would benefit society more than the 'good' feelings that victims may have from knowing the perpetrator is suffering.
1.12.6. Con: Realistically it is not possible to stop a person who has made a reasoned decision to die, so this is not actually a change from the status quo
1.12.7. Con: From the point of view of social protection theory, for a dangerous person to choose death is just as good as if not better than that person's being confined.
1.12.7.1. Con: Dangerous criminals can provide insight useful to law enforcement in protecting society.
1.12.8. Con: It is morally impermissible - whether through private action or the state - to make someone's life so bad that they would prefer to die.
1.12.9. Con: During a trial, the suspect always has the choice between 'continue in this trial' and death. The right to die doesn't change this fact.
1.12.10. Pro: Victims and their families may feel like justice is not fairly being served if criminals are able to decide on the punishment themselves by having the option to choose death over a prison sentence.
1.12.10.1. Pro: Victims often desire that the criminal [comes to terms with their actions](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9c6d/69d76fa235c4ad550fce8da0bb2383874c5d.pdf) and feels remorse. They will be upset if the criminal robs them of the possibility of this ever happening.
1.12.10.1.1. Con: Being a victim does not grant a person the right to control the life of the offender. The victim should not be given a say in what happens to a criminal once they've been sentenced by the legal system.
1.12.10.1.2. Con: Most criminals would come to terms and express remorse during the trial process itself when there are incentives to do so. Few prisoners would approach the family to repent during their time in jail or after release.
1.12.10.1.2.1. Con: The personality and values of a criminal can change drastically over years or decades in prison. Even if they are initially unrepentant, they may later regret their actions and wish to approach the family of the victim.
1.12.10.2. Con: Laws, legal sentences and punishments usually do not take into consideration how victims and relatives feel about them. This is therefore not an appropriate standard to evaluate whether or not we should give prisoners the option of choosing death.
1.12.10.3. Pro: The family members of the murderer [Frank Van Den Bleeken](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/should-sisters-killer-allowed-die-4278333) were outspoken against his desire to die.
1.12.10.4. Con: The choice between a long prison sentence and death is still a choice between two punishments.
1.12.10.4.1. Con: Yet, some punishments are worse than others, and if only in the eyes of the convict, which would allow them to choose whatever they deem less punishing.
1.12.11. Pro: Many criminals are able to be rehabilitated and then re-enter society and lead normal lives. However, if they initially struggle in prison or feel overwhelmed by the length of their punishment, they may choose death when their alternative life could have been much better.
1.13. Con: Life is intrinsically valuable. This means individuals should not have a right to end theirs.
1.13.1. Con: Life is not intrinsically valuable. It is valuable because it brings with it certain morally valuable features - conscious wellbeing, interpersonal connections, aesthetic appreciation and the creation of culture and art. When these features are absent, life is not valuable in itself.
1.13.1.1. Pro: The life of a miserable person living in constant agony and complete isolation, who desires desperately to die, is clearly not intrinsically valuable or something to be protected at all costs. In fact, it would be inhumane to intentionally preserve that person's life.
1.13.1.1.1. Con: Life's value is dependent on both current quality of life and future quality of life; the negative value of current agony, isolation, and desire to die can be outweighed by the positive value of a long and happy life if prevented from suicide. This future quality of life is unknowable, so, except in specific cases like terminal illness, we can't say for certain whether a life has positive or negative value.
1.13.2. Con: Even if life is intrinsically valuable, people have ownership over their own lives and should therefore have the right to end them.
1.13.2.1. Pro: A great painting is intrinsically valuable, but that does not mean we should deny its owner the right to destroy it if they wish.
1.13.2.1.1. Con: This analogy doesn't hold because there is a difference between the owner and the work of art, whereas there is no difference between the individual and their life. Thus, appealing to claims about ownership rights don't necessarily follow.
1.13.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.13.3. Pro: All major religions regard the taking of lives - including one's own - as wrong. This indicates a general human tendency to reject a right to die which prevails across cultural and historical boundaries.
1.13.3.1. Pro: Buddhism rejects the right to die.
1.13.3.1.1. Con: At the same time, Buddhism implies exceptions for when the decision to die is acceptable: if one is [close to enlightenment](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/euthanasiasuicide.shtml) and if one is [already dying](http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol4/suicide_as_a_response_to_suffering.html).
1.13.3.1.1.1. Pro: The Dalai Lama describes euthanasia [as acceptable](http://www.tibet.ca/en/library/wtn/archive/old?y=1996&m=9&p=18_4) for those who are already dying and experience more suffering by staying alive than by dying. Yet these are exceptional cases.
1.13.3.1.1.2. Con: The primary criteria for deciding whether hastening death is acceptable in Buddhism is not the severity of irreversibility of suffering but reaching a [meditative state of mind](http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/becker.htm).
1.13.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Buddhist teachings condone suicide only for those who have already reached enlightenment - which, for all practical purposes, makes suicide unacceptable \([Keown, p. 268](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=QCeFBY1cty8C&pg=PA268&lpg=PA268&dq=%22There+are,+however,+passages+in+the+Nikayas+where+the+Buddha+approves+of+the+suicide+of+bhikkhus:+but+in+these+cases+they+were+Arahants%22&source=bl&ots=eL-rqUxqNN&sig=vs-oPPNd7n_3rdIlGgANatk9tOs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij3f-dq9fTAhWCQpQKHc1iBWEQ6AEIITAA#v=onepage&q=%22There%20are%2C%20however%2C%20passages%20in%20the%20Nikayas%20where%20the%20Buddha%20approves%20of%20the%20suicide%20of%20bhikkhus%3A%20but%20in%20these%20cases%20they%20were%20Arahants%22&f=false)\).
1.13.3.1.2. Pro: A death is considered a continuation of what came before, unhappiness and suffering from previous lives remain linked to oneself. Choosing death is thus [of little help](https://www.lamayeshe.com/article/four-noble-truths). Consciousness continues, and suffering springs from there.
1.13.3.1.3. Pro: The first precept of Buddhism's [code of ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Precepts) prohibits killing; the third rule of the religion's [monastic discipline](http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebsut019.htm) equally prohibits killing and the encouragement of suicide.
1.13.3.1.4. Con: Suicide has in the past been acceptable in Buddhist contexts if it takes place as an expression of selfless martyrdom.
1.13.3.1.4.1. Pro: The self-immolation of Tibetan monks have been interpreted as acts of martyrdom and therefore [as meritorious](http://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2013/03/buddhism-and-self-immolation).
1.13.3.1.4.2. Pro: In Japan, suicide out of selfless concern for others and for societal values such as honor has been perceived as legitimate \([Di Marco, p. 59](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=mDp-CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA59&dq=buddhism+seppuku+suicide&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxyK6Dr9fTAhUGHpQKHeuNCtQQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&q=buddhism%20%20suicide&f=false)\).
1.13.3.2. Pro: Islamic theology does not recognize a right to die.
1.13.3.2.1. Pro: Euthanasia and suicide are not part of the reasons to kill in Islam \([Narimisa, p. 170](http://eujournal.org/index.php/esj/article/viewFile/3707/3560)\).
1.13.3.2.2. Pro: It is understood that Allah decides how long a person lives \([Narimisa, p. 170](http://eujournal.org/index.php/esj/article/viewFile/3707/3560)\).
1.13.3.2.3. Pro: The [Islamic Religious Leadership Council](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/islamic-religious-leadership-council-rules-against-euthanasia-and-assisted-) has positioned itself clearly against a right to die.
1.13.3.3. Pro: Christianity is clearly positioned against a right to die.
1.13.3.3.1. Pro: The [Pope](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/the-pope/11233347/Pope-Francis-denounces-euthanasia-as-sin-against-God.html) declared euthanasia a 'sin against God'.
1.13.3.3.2. Pro: In traditional Christian doctrine, [God](http://www.tkc.com/resources/resources-pages/euthanasia.html) has jurisdiction over life and individual desires are secondary. There is no authority to demand a right to die.
1.13.3.3.2.1. Pro: God claims to be the sovereign giver and taker of life. Thus it's his prerogative solely.
1.13.3.3.2.1.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that a god exists or that claims that god is the sovereign giver and taker of life have any merit.
1.13.3.3.3. Pro: Enduring hardship is part of God's [providence](http://www.tkc.com/resources/resources-pages/euthanasia.html) and, thus, must be accepted.
1.13.3.3.3.1. Con: This a convincing argument against committing suicide as a Christian. It is not a convincing argument to support laws that forbid others from making their own choices. Are we not supposed to lead by living as an example of our faith rather than forcing it upon others?
1.13.3.3.4. Con: -> See 1.13.3.3.3.1.
1.13.3.4. Pro: Hinduism rejects the right to die.
1.13.3.4.1. Pro: Both suicide and euthanasia are perceived [as interfering](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/euthanasia.shtml) with the natural cycle of life and death, thereby creating bad karma and preventing liberation from this cycle.
1.13.3.4.2. Con: Euthanasia can be legitimate under Hinduism if it is compassionate and brings an end to a painful life and prolonged suffering, thus being [a good deed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/euthanasia.shtml).
1.13.3.4.3. Con: Suicide [can be legitimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayopavesa) under Hinduism if it takes place through natural means - that is: fasting to death - and comes at a time when a person is already dying and has reached a state of mental serenity and fulfillness.
1.13.3.4.4. Con: Choosing death by foregoing treatment can be legitimate under Hinduism if this happens for compassionate reasons, for example to spare loved ones the burden of treatment and of emotional pain \([Campell, p. 39](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001184/118482E.pdf)\).
1.13.3.4.5. Pro: One of the basic virtues of Hinduism is the abstention from doing harm and [nonviolence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa), either to oneself or to others or even animals.
1.13.3.5. Con: Religious ethics are not permanent but change over time. They are therefore not a good guide.
1.13.3.5.1. Pro: The doctrines of the Catholic church [develop and change](http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/3455/development_of_doctrine_or_change_in_teaching.aspx) within the basic tenets of the Christian world view.
1.13.3.5.1.1. Pro: Pope Pius IX in 1864 explicitly [rejected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabus_of_Errors) a separation of the state and the church. Pope Francis, in contrast, [argues](http://www.la-croix.com/Religion/Pape/INTERVIEW-Pope-Francis-2016-05-17-1200760633) that "states must be secular".
1.13.3.5.1.2. Pro: The church [admitted its error](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/31/world/after-350-years-vatican-says-galileo-was-right-it-moves.html) in rejecting the Copernican theory of the solar system and forcing Galileo to recant his support of a heliocentric world view in the 17th century. This is despite the significance of the Earth-centric model of the universe to Christianity's [anthropocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocentrism#Judeo-Christian_tradition).
1.13.3.5.1.3. Pro: Over centuries the Church's stance on slavery [changed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_slavery#Did_Church_teaching_on_slavery_change.3F) from toleration and acceptance towards opposition.
1.13.3.5.1.4. Pro: The Church revised its stance towards the [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_antisemitism) from open antisemitism to reconciliation.
1.13.3.5.2. Con: Judaeo-Christian adherence to the basic ten commandments including "Thou shalt not murder" is the foundation of modern law.  While interpretation has adjusted somewhat, it has not really changed in thousands of years.  Therefore, these basic guidelines are a very good guide and are common sense as well.
1.13.3.6. Con: Religion may have been an important part of human history, yet many people perceive it as unimportant today. There is little reason to see why they should adhere to religions' teachings about the right to die.
1.13.3.6.1. Pro: [About 15%](http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-unaffiliated/) of the world's population consider themselves not affiliated with any religion. If the state gives people the right to die, people who follow certain religions can still decide to not exercise it. But if the state does prohibit people to choose death, these 15% are deprived of something.
1.13.3.6.2. Pro: In a significant number of countries [the majority of people](http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx) perceive religion as not important to their lives.
1.13.3.7. Con: The legitimacy and authority of religious values should not extend beyond the extent to which its followers embrace those values. Unless a person believes that suicide is wrong because of their faith, religious values should not be considered when determining the ethics of suicide.
1.13.3.8. Con: Most religious views are not so simple. While they may object to taking a life, even one's own, they still condone martyrdom and  religious wars. In some circumstances self sacrifice can be a holy act, and should be a personal ethical choice.
1.13.3.9. Con: The fact that religions reject suicide, or that humanity has a general tendency to do so, does not mean that it is morally wrong. For example, there is a human tendency and religious permission \(in some religions\) to hold slaves - yet is is considered morally wrong by all countries in the world, as of today. Since there are many such examples, religion and human habits in general, are a questionable source for good moral behavior.
1.13.4. Con: Life is only precious when it is filled with the freedom to make choices. Without the ultimate freedom of choosing when or how you die, a life loses its preciousness, and instead becomes indentured to a state or society.
1.13.5. Con: Life is not intrinsically valuable. Wellbeing and dignity are often the values people hold in higher regard. There will be circumstances when such a value will mean ending life is a rational decision.
1.13.6. Con: The connection between life being valuable and "therefore" people should not be allowed to destroy it is non-existent.
We destroy things of value all the time, notably and especially those things which are ours to own & control.
Value is not a determinant for permission to destroy. It can factor into one's personal choice in destroying, but doesn't inherently require protection.
1.13.7. Con: The idea that human life is valuable is arbitrary and based on nothing but \(generally religious\) moral value.
1.14. Pro: Introducing a right to die will be beneficial for society.
1.14.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.4.
1.14.2. Pro: Western societies have become so medicalized, and litigation-sensitive, that prolongation of life is seen as an unquestionable given. Our society should evolve to embrace the alternative: that quality of life is often more important than quantity of years, and therefore people should be able to make this choice for themselves.
1.14.3. Con: Society is built upon the dependence of people on other people. Allowing the self-removal from this system will negatively impact how society can depend on each other.
1.14.4. Pro: The right to die would reduce medical costs per capital by allowing people to die instead of receiving expensive treatment
1.14.5. Pro: Legalization could reduce the number of annoying and undesirable people in the world- thus creating a better world
1.14.6. Con: Since we are not able to predict future we cant say there wont be solution to the problem that caused suicidal thinking at the first place. Depression -\> change in life, illnes -\> cure, bankruptcy -\> new job offer, broken hearth -\> new love, etc. These people and their experience are valuable to the society as hope, motivation, cheerful stories and that is not counting their usual economic addition. And usually suicidal people DO have these solvable problems.
1.14.7. Pro: A right to die would voluntarily free up needed resources for others whose lives could be saved.
1.14.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.3.
1.14.9. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.14.10. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.14.11. Con: People who decide to die due to high debts will hurt their creditors; consider, for example, people with large student loans.
1.14.11.1. Con: Many [debts](https://www.balancepro.net/education/publications/debtafterdeath.html) continue after death. These remain the obligation of the estate of the deceased.
1.14.11.2. Pro: In [India](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/in-80-farmer-suicides-due-to-debt-loans-from-banks-not-moneylenders-4462930/), economic factors such as debt are considered to have played a role in the epidemic of farmer suicides.
1.14.11.3. Con: As with other reasons for defaulting on debt, this is simply part of the nature of lending, one which creditors need to factor into their actuarial calculations.
1.15. Con: There are huge difficulties in determining whether people can give true consent to die. Consent is necessary for the successful implementation of a right to die.
1.15.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.
1.15.2. Con: It is often difficult to determine whether people can truly consent to life saving treatments \(for example, people may not be lucid or even conscious\). That does not mean that these challenges cannot be met through procedures like delegating responsibility to close relations of the patient.
1.15.3. Con: Society regularly allows people to consent to activities with a high risk of death such as base jumping, acting as an undercover informant, or smoking. Even if the odds of death are lower, participants nevertheless consent to the possibility.
1.15.3.1. Con: No one gives consent to die by participating in these activities. People usually try to minimize the risk of dying even when participating in these inherently risky activities.
1.15.3.2. Con: Society enabling people to do activities is not the same as establishing true consent. People who perform dangerous activities may not fully realize the consequences of their actions or fully recognize that they could fall to the risk of dying, even if they are aware that the risk of dying exist.
1.15.4. Con: Society already allows people to opt in to [Do Not Resuscitate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_resuscitate) orders that prevent doctors from saving their lives. While there is a distinction between action and inaction, people consent to death in either circumstance.
1.15.4.1. Con: The distinction between action and inaction is precisely what makes DNR orders different from assisted suicide. Assisted suicide is consenting to the specific idea of death. DNR orders are consenting to refuse treatment, whether or not a death is imminent.
1.15.5. Pro: Consent is generally seen as [mandatory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18502422) for clinical treatment except in case of emergency.
1.15.6. Pro: We would like to believe we should have full authority over our own lives but, without a moral foundation and a system of checks, abuse of such policy is likely.
1.15.6.1. Con: A system of checks can be implemented. The moral foundation is simply a human one \(when suffering becomes prolonged and unbearable, then life itself becomes unbearable and should be allowed to end\).
1.15.7. Con: Assisted suicide need severe scrutiny: they would require evidence, and a real debate among peers of medical specialist as well as witnesses from the individuals personal life.
1.15.7.1. Con: A right to die means that many people will chose to die despite not having a traumatic life. In these cases, witnesses and medical specialists would not be helpful.
1.15.7.2. Pro: The motion, as described here, is too liberal: most unsuccessful suicide attempts don't try again \([hsph.harvard.edu](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/survival/)\). With that in mind, there should be obstacles: medical expert opinion and long-term consent \(not just acute consent\).
1.15.8. Pro: The choice of euthanasia cannot be provided to the young as it would be abused by children who suffered a bad day.
1.15.8.1. Con: Minors are largely not in charge of their medical choices. Such responsibilities rest on the shoulders of parents and caregivers.
1.15.9. Con: This isn't an argument against right-to-die, it's an argument in favor of better systems of determining consent to that death.
1.15.9.1. Con: "Consent is necessary for for the successful implementation of a right to die." Consent is the necessary condition for the successful implementation of a right to die. Without consent, there is no successful implementation. This is what an argument is.
1.15.10. Pro: Those suffering from certain diseases or mental illness may not be competent to make that decision.
1.15.10.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.3.1.1.
1.15.10.2. Pro: Suicidal tendencies could arguably constitute enough mental deficiency to lose the right to make your own decisions.
1.15.10.3. Pro: Those with intense pain due to physical or mental illness/intense emotional distress may rush into a decision to die as the pain might cloud their ability to imagine a future absent the pain.
1.15.10.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.1.
1.15.10.3.2. Con: Patients can be informed about the probability of a miracle recovery or other chance of improvement, and take this into account.
1.15.10.3.3. Con: Even if a few patients prematurely end their lives when their illness might have been cured, this is an acceptable price to pay for the alleviation of immense suffering for many, many others.
1.15.10.3.4. Pro: While suffering from an illness may cause periods where a person feels depressed or overwhelmed, it does not mean they have nothing to live for and decisions like death shouldn't be made in the moment.
1.15.10.4. Pro: One of the most common [causes](http://caps.ucsc.edu/resources/depression.html) of suicide is mental illness, most often depression.
1.15.10.4.1. Con: To want to rid yourself of the pain and stigma that comes with a mental illness is a perfectly rational choice. Just because there may be a cure 10 years down the line does not mean that the pain is worth bearing.
1.16. Con: The modern state is responsible for the well-being of its citizens. Thus it should not allow them to hurt/kill themselves.
1.16.1. Con: "Well-being" should not be confused with "living longer". [Quality of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life_\(healthcare\)) is a better metric. If ending your life stops poor quality of life, then it is best for the well-being of the patient to end their life.
1.16.1.1. Con: Quality of life is famously mismeasured. Measures of quality of life usually rate both happiness and ability to perform specific tasks, and don't differentiate between the two. This leads to results that make it look as if people are unhappy just because they can't do things.  This is misleading in the extreme.
1.16.2. Pro: Giving people the right to die would remove incentives for states \(or private healthcare institutions\) to fund palliative care and end of life treatment, since there is a viable alternative option for patients.
1.16.2.1. Con: Considering how very sensitive the subject of a right to die is from a mere theoretical standpoint, it would be very unlikely for a government or company to risk the real-life controversy of de-funding palliative care for economic or efficiency-related reasons.
1.16.2.1.1. Con: Government already under-funds palliative care and would further do this if euthanasia is both legal and morally acceptable.
1.16.3. Pro: We already try to prevent self harm in other areas such as anorexia. There is no reason why suicide should be different.
1.16.3.1. Con: There is a difference between a right to die and suicide prevention/support groups. Both social awareness and right to die can \(and should\) coexist.
1.16.4. Con: Any state with a Bill of Rights \(regardless of modernity\) is responsible for protecting the rights of any given citizen from infringement without due process. In this case, the protective responsibility of the state has no causation with the right to die. I am denying the premise in the above claim and therefore denying the parent's claim of one possible piece of support.  It might be the case that ppl have a right to kill themselves, but its not because of the "modern state"
1.16.5. Con: A citizen, with conscience and free will, has the right to pursue his or her own well-being. It is the responsibility of the state to protect this human right and allow a person to chose life or death for themselves.
1.16.5.1. Con: As a member of the human race, it's a moral requirement to do our best to continue and expand our species. Any form of suicide is doing the exact opposite.
1.16.6. Pro: Besides depriving people of their right to live by birth control, giving them the right to die is paradoxical.
1.16.7. Con: The state shall not decide what citizens do to their property, body and life included.
1.16.8. Pro: Moreover there is psychological effect in medicine with doctors not having the choice to suggest killing yourself no matter how bad the situation is. This is the KEY piece of patient - doctor relationship and if patient has the slightest suspicion about doctor thinking about it, the whole psychological concept will fall apart.
1.16.9. Con: -> See 1.14.
1.16.10. Con: The responsibility for citizens' well-being requires governmental intervention, which is contrary to the provision of personal autonomy. In liberal democracies the protection of personal freedom and self-determination is of utmost importance.
1.16.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.16.10.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.16.11. Con: If a person expresses a strong desire to die, then remaining alive is against their interests. Forcing them to stay alive thus harms them instead of protecting them.
1.16.11.1. Pro: A desire to die is a strong signal that a person's life contains more suffering than happiness. In this case, death would be good for that person.
1.16.11.1.1. Con: Certain mental conditions such as depression can cause this mistaken belief, and allowing them to act upon this desire will prevent them from seeking help which could let them lead normal lives.
1.16.11.2. Pro: When we say that someone "desires" to die, we generally do not mean that it is merely another incidental desire among many others - after all, dying involves not fulfilling all our other desires. We mean that, upon reflection, this person has decided that they have decisive reasons to want to die. Given this, it is [good for them to die.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/#DesThe)
1.16.11.3. Con: We should evaluate someone's life by the total amount of desires satisfied during their lifetime, not the satisfaction of desires at a particular moment in time.
1.16.11.3.1. Con: If a person dies, then no future desires ever come into existence and therefore no future desires are ever left unfulfilled, so the person who dies is not harmed by death.
1.16.11.3.2. Con: This is implausible to implement.
1.16.11.3.3. Pro: Death means that none of a person's future desires can ever be satisfied. Even if death maximally satisfies a person's present desires, desire-fulfillment theory would say that it is bad for them if this is outweighed by the lack of fulfillment of future desires.
1.16.11.4. Pro: It is clear that some lives \(for example, those filled with endless torture\) are not worth living, so life is not worth living in and of itself - certain minimum conditions must hold for a life to be worth living, and a desire to continue living is arguably one of those.
1.16.11.4.1. Con: There is no consensus on what lives are or are not worth living.
1.16.11.4.2. Con: People make assumptions about what lives are worth living that are not borne out by reality: [Doctors and nondisabled people consistently rate quality of life for disabled people lower than disabled people rate their own quality of life.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-5914.2010.00437.x) This suggests bias in deciding whose life is worth living. Different people also have very different ideas whose life is worth living, and people change their minds about whether their own life is worth living after circumstances change. There is no objectivity.
1.16.12. Pro: The state is responsible for the protection of all of the parts of one person's life, and should prevent that person's current self from denying their future self the opportunity to live.
1.16.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.16.12.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.2.3.
1.16.12.3. Pro: Just as the state has a responsibility to protect future generations, it has an even stronger responsibility to protect future manifestations of ourselves.
1.16.12.3.1. Con: The state is only responsible for the care of "future generations" as a vague entity, not specific members of future generations.
1.16.12.3.1.1. Pro: Concern for future generations is explainable by a desire to preserve the intrinsic value of the human race, cultural value, and so forth, and does not require commitment to the moral significance of potential persons. Therefore, concern for future generations does not mean we should be concerned for future versions of a person.
1.16.12.3.1.2. Pro: If the state was responsible for caring for specific members of future generations, this would have strongly counterintuitive implications.
1.16.12.3.1.2.1. Pro: For example, choosing to substantially raise the quality of life of future generations could [harm many potential future people](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonidentity-problem/#Dep) by causing them not to exist, since the patterns of behaviour that led to their birth could be changed.
1.16.12.3.2. Pro: The state does \(or should\) take action against climate change, and does \(or should\) invest in [long-term](https://www.iaea.org/OurWork/SS/storage.html) \(often century-long\) containment of radioactive waste. This clearly illustrates concern for future generations.
