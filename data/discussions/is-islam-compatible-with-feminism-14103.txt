Discussion Title: Is Islam compatible with feminism?

1. Islam is compatible with feminism.
1.1. Pro: Islam is deeply rooted in the belief in equality for all.
1.1.1. Pro: The Quranic world-view renders patriarchy antithetical to the belief in the oneness of God and one's submission to his will.
1.1.1.1. Pro: The theological principle of 'tawhid' \(the unity and oneness of God\) dictates that human beings can only be in [horizontal relationships](https://journal.fi/ar/article/view/67552/27848) with one another \(i.e. one of equality\), since any vertical or hierarchical relations among them \(e.g. patriarchy\) will negate the oneness of God and human beings’ submission to the Divine \(p. 87 para. 2\).
1.1.1.2. Pro: According to the Quran, the sole basis for superiority of any person over another is piety and righteousness, not gender, color or nationality. \(Surat Al-Hujurat, [verse 13](https://quran.com/49/13)\)
1.1.2. Con: Traditional Islamic jurisprudence is not accepting of those who identify as LGBTQ+, whereas feminism stands to liberate all women, including ones who are included in this group.
1.1.2.1. Con: It's possible to be a feminist and not support the LGBTQ+ movement. Many heterosexual feminists \(such as [Betty Friedan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Friedan#Lesbian_politics)\) do not consider lesbian issues as being central to feminist activism.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: There are differences of opinion even within the LGBTQ+ community. For instance, many lesbian feminists \(such as [Julie Bindel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bindel#Gender,_bisexuality)\) are critical of bisexuality and transgenderism.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: There are many different [branches](http://diglib.bis.uni-oldenburg.de/pub/unireden/ur97/kap1.pdf) of feminism. Just because Islam is not compatible with certain branches does not mean that it is not compatible with all of feminism. Many branches of feminism disagree with each other, their common goal is equality between the sexes.
1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: One does not have to believe in every aspect of feminism in order to be a feminist. There are many different branches of feminism some of which are concerned about abortion rights and others who are [not](http://www.feministsforlife.org/).
1.1.2.1.2. Con: Being supportive of women, regardless of their sexual orientation, is the essence of feminism. Condemning women who are not attracted to men is not feminist. It's as if saying that women belong only with men when in a relationship, no matter what.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: In seeking to evaluate the role of gender and sexuality on women's lives, engaging with and understanding the struggles of LGBTQ+ individuals is necessary for feminism to understand how traditional understandings of sexuality affect women's lives. Ignoring this leaves feminism only partially able to explain the problems facing women.
1.1.2.2. Con: Islam has a tolerant attitude towards transgender Muslims. Islamic literature mentions “[Mukhannathun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukhannathun)” \(effeminate ones\)- gender-variant persons of the Islamic faith who are accepted within the boundaries of Islam.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: In Pakistan, members of the transgender community live as [hijras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_\(South_Asia\)), and are officially recognized as [a third-gender](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-lgbt-passport/pakistan-issues-landmark-transgender-passport-fight-for-rights-goes-on-idUSKBN19J237).
1.1.2.2.2. Con: The mukhannathun as a group do not fit into any one of the [prevailing categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukhannathun#Gender_and_sexuality) of gender or sexuality used by modern LGBT communities.
1.1.2.2.3. Pro: In the late 1980s, transgender sex-reassignment surgery was legalized \([made halal](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15532739.2016.1250239)\) in shari'a and in state law by the fatwas of Ayatollah Khomeini and Sheikh al-Tantawi in Iran and Egypt, respectively. This shows an expansion in the scope of Islamic tolerance towards transgender Muslims.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Homosexuality is [punished](https://www.missionislam.com/knowledge/homosexuality.htm) in traditional Islamic jurisprudence and is prohibited in religious texts.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: The death penalty for homosexuality is currently applied [only](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_penalty_for_homosexuality) in Islamic countries.
1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: This statement is only true of this era in history. In the 19th century, homosexual behaviour was punishable by death in much of Europe. By comparison, Islamic countries were highly tolerant of LGBTQ+ individuals at the time. Homosexuality was in fact legalized in the Ottoman empire in 1858, as part of the [Tanzimat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzimat). Thus this is a product of cultural ebb and flow, rather than the religion itself
1.1.2.4. Con: Islam itself does not contain a system of jurisprudence. Any legal systems rooted in Islam are interpretations and extrapolations of the Qur'an and the Prophet's teachings. As such, these systems should be examined in light of the culture and context they were created in. [Vogel](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-PfDuvnHMGoC&lpg=PP1&dq=vogel%20islamic%20law&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q=vogel%20islamic%20law&f=false) here explains that the Shari'a - the divine law revealed \(according to Islamic beliefs\) through the Qur'an and the Prophet's example, is interpreted into Fiqh - the legal systems used by Muslim communities.
1.1.3. Pro: Due to its focus on equality, [historically](https://stepfeed.com/this-is-how-islam-led-the-world-with-women-s-rights-0090) Islam brought about rights for women which would not be achieved until much later in the Western world.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Islam was the first religion to give women rights of [inheritance](http://www.reviewofreligions.org/1555/islam-and-women%E2%80%99s-rights/).
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Women are given a [lesser share](https://www.al-islam.org/faith-and-reason-ayatullah-mahdi-hadavi-tehrani/question-32-difference-inheritance-women-and-men) of inheritance as compared to men.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: This is a simplistic understanding of [Islamic law](http://www.dar-alifta.org/Foreign/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=4825&CategoryID=5). While a man does inherit twice what a women inherits, a man has a responsibility to provide for his female relations. This equals out the inheritance as the money a man inherits must be used in part to feed, shelter and clothe the women in his family, while all of the money the woman inherits she can keep without even the obligation to spend it on her own sustenance eg. food, clothing, medication.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: A man has the complete [financial responsibility and duty](http://www.dar-alifta.org/Foreign/ViewFatwa.aspx?ID=8337) of running a household or a family. A woman has [no financial responsibility](http://womeninislam.ws/en/misconceptions_household-responsibilities.aspx) or obligation laid upon her by Shariah to provide for a household. This has been used as an excuse for men dominating within the space of the household.
1.1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: The indignity a woman suffers by getting a smaller inheritance than the men in her family is not balanced out by the fact that the men in her family will provide for her, when in fact their providing for her is in practice contingent on her playing a submissive role and accepting their control, subjugation, supervision, and even their religion.
1.1.3.2. Pro: The [Quran](https://stepfeed.com/this-is-how-islam-led-the-world-with-women-s-rights-0090) encourages education for both men and women and equal pay for all workers of any gender.
1.1.3.3. Con: The fact that Islam was a force of liberation at the point of its inception is irrelevant if it is a cause of oppression in the modern day.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: While not totally descriptive of Islam as an ideology, historical examples such as those identified help in divorcing modern cultural forces driving the oppression of women and the role of Islam itself. That Islam has historically been able to accommodate and empower women says much about its compatibility with feminism.
1.1.3.4. Pro: [Sisters in Islam](https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/organizations/sisters-in-islam), a group of Muslim women studying and researching the status of women in Islam, state that Islam, from its outset, was a liberating religion that uplifted the status of women and gave them rights that were considered revolutionary 1400 years ago. Their research shows that repressive interpretations of the Quran are for the most part influenced by cultural practices and values that subordinate women to men. \(Lifting the Veil: Women and Islamic Law,[pg.27](http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1103&context=facpubs)\)
1.1.3.5. Pro: Islam condemned and put an end to female infanticide, which was [widely prevalent](https://discover-the-truth.com/2015/02/08/pre-islamic-arabia-infanticide/) in pre-Islamic Arabia. \(Surah At-Takwir, [verses 8-9](https://quran.com/81/8-9)\)
1.1.3.6. Con: These rights may not have been given due to a focus on equality. There are economic motives to consider.
1.1.3.7. Con: Western culture abolished slavery and subjugation of women because it's self critical. Western culture questioned itself and then corrected itself. Muslims however [do](https://medium.com/\@sd_saurav/fatwa-hunted-in-america-a-conversation-with-pamela-geller-2c67f5f5bc1e) [not](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3193250/we-must-be-able-to-criticise-islam-without-fear-of-being-branded-islamophobes/) [tolerate](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/shooting-outside-draw-muhammad-contest-texas-n352996) any criticism of Islam. They are not open to any self criticism or debate on any matter.
1.1.4. Con: [Islam](http://www.fiqhcouncil.org/node/12) promotes equality in submission to God. However, the Quran dictates the roles of men and women in every aspect of life.  In the dictates of those roles, they are not equal.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Islamic religious doctrine institutionalizes patriarchy using certain traditions and practices.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Islam prevents the sexual liberation of women.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: In Islam, the foetus is believed to become a living soul after four months of gestation \(Sahih al-Bukhari, [4:54:430](http://cmje.usc.edu/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/054-sbt.php#004.054.430)\), and [abortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_abortion) after that point is generally viewed as impermissible, except in some very narrow exceptions.
1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: According to a Pew Research Center [poll](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-morality/#_ftnref3), most Muslims say that having an abortion is morally wrong, including three-quarters or more in 24 of the 37 countries where the question was asked.
1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Believers of a religion can hold views that are not compatible with feminism. This does not necessarily mean that the religion is not compatible with feminism.
1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If these beliefs are informed by the religion, or even are held by the majority of that religion, they become the religion. Religions are living and change to adapt to their adherents beliefs.
1.1.4.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Islamic doctrine states that women must wear the head scarf or Hijab to preserve their modesty. No such attempt at preservation of modesty exists for men.
1.1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Both men and women share the task of responsibility regarding [Islamic Hijab](https://www.al-islam.org/islamic-hijab-al-balagh/responsibility-hijab-man-and-woman), although the term Hijab, in relation to men, does not have [the same technical meaning](https://www.islamicinsights.com/religion/the-hijab-of-men.html) as it does in reference to women. Men too are required to cover their bodies from the view of non-Mahram women \(Surah an-Nur, [24:30](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=24&verse=30)\).
1.1.4.1.1.3. Con: The acceptable and natural status of womens' [sexual pleasure](https://www.al-islam.org/marriage-and-morals-islam-sayyid-muhammad-rizvi/chapter-two-islamic-sexual-morality-1-its-foundation) in Islam, whose scripture states that husbands and wives should care about one another's sexual pleasure, points to a positive attitude towards women's sexuality in Islam - especially in comparison to other religions.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.4.1.3. Con: Many Islamic traditions and teachings deemphasise toxic masculinity.
1.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.5.
1.1.4.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.1.4.1.3.3. Con: Islam has been criticised by feminists for supporting [hegemonic toxic masculinity](https://feminismandreligion.com/2018/04/19/muslim-men-and-toxic-masculinity-by-vanessa-rivera-de-la-fuente/) and the belittling of women. This is supported by the ability of influential leaders, who are [predominantly male](http://www.ijhssnet.com/journals/Vol_2_No_17_September_2012/29.pdf), to justify and validate their interpretations of scripture as the unimpeachable "word of God".
1.1.4.1.4. Pro: In Islam, positions of authority are delegated to men.
1.1.4.1.4.1. Pro: The [Caliph](http://islamicsystem.blogspot.com/2018/03/why-cant-woman-be-ruler-in-caliphate.html) of the Ummah must be a man.
1.1.4.1.4.2. Con: Muslim majority countries have produced several female heads of state, prime ministers, and state secretaries, including [Lala Shovkat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lala_Shevket) \(Azerbaijan\), [Benazir Bhutto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benazir_Bhutto) \(Pakistan\), [Mame Madior Boye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mame_Madior_Boye) \(Senegal\), [Tansu Çiller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tansu_%C3%87iller) \(Turkey\), [Kaqusha Jashari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaqusha_Jashari) \(Kosovo\), [Megawati Sukarnoputri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megawati_Sukarnoputri) \(Indonesia\), [Khaleda Zia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia) and [Sheikh Hasina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina) \(Bangladesh\).
1.1.4.1.4.3. Pro: Popular interpretations of the Quran suggest that all of Allah's prophets were [men and not women](https://islamqa.info/en/158044) because women were not as strong and could not carry out such arduous tasks.
1.1.4.1.4.3.1. Con: This is [contended](http://aboutislam.net/counseling/ask-about-islam/female-prophets-islam/) by many Islamic scholars. There is no agreement on whether there were or were not female prophets.
1.1.4.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: In Arabic when there is a plural which has a mix of masculine and feminine people the masculine use of the word is used, therefore in [Al-Anbiyaa](http://aboutislam.net/counseling/ask-about-islam/female-prophets-islam/) the noun used to describe the prophets could have been both male and female.
1.1.4.1.4.4. Con: Historically, there are examples of women who have [held political authority](http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2510) in Muslim societies in the pre-modern era. Examples of female rulers include Khayzuran, who governed the Muslim Empire under three Abbasid caliphs in the eighth century; Malika Asma bint Shihab al-Sulayhiyya and Malika Arwa bint Ahmad al-Sulayhiyya, who both held power in Yemen in the eleventh century and Sitt al-Mulk, a Fatimid queen of Egypt in the eleventh century.
1.1.4.1.4.4.1. Con: These women are exceptions and their power rooted from their spouses' death, [not](https://en.qantara.de/content/guardians-of-thrones-when-women-ruled-the-muslim-world?nopaging=1) from gender equality itself.
1.1.4.1.4.5. Con: Caliph Umar appointed women to serve as [officials](http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2510) in the market of Medina.
1.1.4.1.4.6. Pro: According to all currently existing traditional schools of Islam, a woman [cannot be](http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_351_400/women_as_imams.htm) an Imam and lead a mixed gender congregation in prayer.
1.1.4.1.4.7. Pro: When the Prophet heard the news that the people of Persia had made the daughter of Khosrau their queen \(ruler\), he is reported to have said, "Never will succeed such a nation that makes a woman their ruler." \([Sahih al-Bukhari 7099](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/92/50)\)
1.1.4.1.4.8. Con: There is no verse in the Quran regarding the permission or prohibition of a woman's rule in a country. The Quran is silent on this issue, leaving room for the Muslim community to make a decision according to the circumstances and time.
1.1.4.1.4.8.1. Pro: The Quran mentions the story of a woman ruler, [Bilqis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_Quran#The_Queen_of_Sheba_\(Bilqis\)), the Queen of Sheba. Instead of talking about her rule with disapproval and condemnation, it appreciates her habit of consultation, wisdom, sound judgment and readiness to accept Islam.
1.1.4.1.4.9. Pro: A majority of muslim scholars are of the view that it is [not permissible](https://islamqa.info/en/71338) for a woman to be appointed as a judge.
1.1.4.1.5. Pro: Islamic law discriminates between men and women.
1.1.4.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.
1.1.4.1.5.2. Pro: Muslim men [are allowed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygyny_in_Islam) to practice polygyny and can have up to a total of four wives at one time. Polyandry, the practice of a woman having more than one husband, however, is not permitted.
1.1.4.1.5.3. Pro: A man is [allowed to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfaith_marriage_in_Islam) marry a woman from among the People of the Book \(Jews and Christians\), but a woman can only marry a muslim.
1.1.4.1.5.4. Pro: The testimony of women is given [less weightage](https://islamqa.info/en/1105) in a court of law as compared to a man's.
1.1.4.1.5.4.1. Pro: It states in the Quran that a woman's opinion is worth only half of a man's opinion. It states that two men are needed to vote or give an opinion. If only one man is available, you need two women to substitute for one man. With a direct claim that women are intellectually inferior. Sahih Bukari 2658. If one woman errs, the other woman is supposed to remind her what's up. \([Surah 2, verse 282](https://quran.com/2/282)\).
1.1.4.1.5.5. Pro: The right to divorce is not equally granted to men and women.
1.1.4.1.5.5.1. Pro: [According to Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Islam#Divorce), a woman may only divorce her husband under certain conditions. These include neglect, not being supported financially, the husband's impotence, apostasy, madness, dangerous illness or some other defect in the marriage. In contrast to the comparatively limited methods of divorce available to a woman, Islam allows a Muslim husband to unilaterally divorce his wife.
1.1.4.1.5.5.1.1. Pro: If a Muslim woman wishes to divorce her husband she has [two options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Islam#Divorce) under Sharia law: seek a tafriq, or seek a khul. A tafriq is a divorce for certain allowable reasons, granted by a religious judge \(qadi\). If a tafriq is denied by the qadi, the woman cannot divorce. The second method, [khul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khul%27), is a divorce without cause, by mutual consent. This divorce requires a husband's consent.
1.1.4.1.5.5.1.2. Pro: [Talaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_in_Islam#Talaq_\(repudiation\)), in classical Islamic law, is the husband's right to dissolve the marriage by simply announcing to his wife that he repudiates her.
1.1.4.1.5.5.1.2.1. Pro: The wife has the right of repudiation only if the husband delegates this right to her \([tafwid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafwid#Divorce)\).
1.1.4.1.5.5.1.3. Con: The [Quran](https://www.islamicity.org/quransearch/?ref=4:19) tells women that men cannot hold them against their will in regards to marriage.
1.1.4.1.5.5.2. Pro: The husband is free to marry again immediately after a divorce, but the woman must observe [iddah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iddah), that is wait for 3 lunar months before she can remarry after divorce, to establish paternity, in case she discovers she is pregnant. \(Surah Al-Baqarah, [verse 228](https://quran.com/2/228)\)
1.1.4.1.5.5.3. Pro: To divorce his wife, all a muslim husband has to do is say "I divorce you", three times in front of witnesses. A similar privilege is not afforded the muslim wife. This is known as Talaq al-bid'ah, some say it is a pre-Islamic custom, not Quranic - but it is still the muslim mans right. Ref:[en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_in_Islam#cite_note-esposito-30-17) L. Esposito, with Natana J. DeLong-Bas \(2001\). Women in Muslim Family Law \(2nd ed.\). Syracuse University Press. pp. 30–31.
1.1.4.1.5.6. Con: Islam promotes egalitarianism, which is expressed by guaranteeing women certain [rights](https://nsuworks.nova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=shss_dcar_etd) such as the right to life, to education, to conduct business, maintain property, and to keep their names \(p. 32, para 1\).
1.1.4.1.5.6.1. Con: The guarantee of a small number of rights, which often fail to materialize for women in [islamic states](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-womens-rights-driving-ban-lifted-marriage-custody-bank-accounts-travel-medical-a7969551.html), do not mean that Islam is feminist as Islamic scripture entrenches and emboldens oppressive gender roles in other aspects of its scripture.
1.1.4.1.5.6.1.1. Con: No one \(here\) is arguing that Islam is feminist. The question is whether feminism and Islam are compatible. Spaghetti and meat balls are not the same thing, but very much compatible. While Islam may be linked to some harms to women's rights, this does not mean that Islam as a whole is incompatible with feminism as a whole.
1.1.4.1.5.6.1.1.1. Con: The Quran is seen as the word of God and truth. At the core of Feminism is the equality of men and women and the liberation of women and men of patriarchal structures. Throughout the Quran, there are rules that promote a patriarchal structure. To respond to the simile: Meat balls and veganism are not the same, but if you put meat balls in a vegan dish, it's not vegan anymore.
1.1.4.1.5.6.1.1.2. Pro: In practice, we see that some Muslims are feminists. When someone can combine his/her religion with an egalitarian world view, no one else should define their religion for them.
1.1.4.1.5.6.2. Con: The scriptural guarantees of rights to women in Islam are limited by their depiction of women only in the roles of wives, mothers and daughters. As a result, they often marginalize those who fall outside the traditional paradigms of women depicted within scriptural texts. [\(p.31\)](https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/17220/ISIM_21_Islamic_Feminism_and_Gender_Equality.pdf)
1.1.4.1.5.7. Pro: Diyah, the financial compensation paid to the victim or heirs of a victim in the cases of murder, bodily harm or property damage, is not the same for [Muslim women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diya_\(Islam\)#For_women_and_non-Muslims) and Muslim men in Sharia courts, with a Muslim woman's life and diyah compensation sentence being half as that of a Muslim man's life.
1.1.4.1.6. Pro: Islamic doctrine enforces strict segregation between men and women.
1.1.4.1.6.1. Pro: Islamic doctrine [prevents](https://insideislam.wisc.edu/2010/12/gender-separation-in-mosques-unequal-segregation-or-mindful-modesty/) women from praying alongside men in congregational prayers.
1.1.4.1.6.2. Pro: Religious doctrine imposes [restrictions](https://www.al-islam.org/code-ethics-muslim-men-and-women-sayyid-masud-masumi/rules-related-socializing) on female interactions with non-mahram men or men that are strangers and not part of the immediate family.
1.1.4.1.7. Con: The institutionalisation of patriarchy can be [attributed](https://nsuworks.nova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=shss_dcar_etd) to the cultural practices and traditional, male-dominated religious interpretations of Islamic scripture, rather than religious doctrine \(p. 3, para 3\).
1.1.4.1.7.1. Pro: Many of the Islamic jurisprudences which affect sharia and personal status laws originate their institutional, legal, and scriptural discourses from the patriarchal Abbasid dynasty in ninth and tenth century Iraq. Therefore, Qur’anic interpretations have been impacted by misogynistic men’s paradigms in a [patriarchal context](http://digitalcommons.linfield.edu/relsstud_theses/1/); this has resulted in biased readings that have been responsible for marginalizing and suppressing the experiences of women \(p. 30 para. 3\).
1.1.4.1.7.1.1. Pro: With the rise of [Islamic feminism](https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/17220/ISIM_21_Islamic_Feminism_and_Gender_Equality.pdf) and an increased scope for women to interpret scripture independently, there is now the possibility of reversing this trend of male dominated interpretation of scripture.
1.1.4.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Participation by women in the field of Islamic legal scholarship is growing. Today, some of the most important work is being done by female Islamic scholars, including [Dr. Asifa Quraishi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asifa_Quraishi), [Azizah al-Hibri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azizah_Y._al-Hibri), and [Madhavi Sunder](http://biography.lawi.asia/madhavi-sunder/). \(Lifting the Veil: Women and Islamic Law, [pg.25](http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1103&context=facpubs)\)
1.1.4.1.7.1.2. Con: If a religion has been dominated by patriarchy for over a millennium, then efforts to reverse that trend are close to impossible.
1.1.4.1.7.2. Pro: Patriarchy is a consequence of individuals [confusing](http://digitalcommons.linfield.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=relsstud_theses) sex \(biology\) with its social constructions \(gender\) when attempting to understand verses in the Quran regarding men and women, rather than religious doctrine \(p.29, para. 2\)
1.1.4.1.7.2.1. Pro: Due to gender - the ideas of which have been shaped in a patriarchal milieu - being exchanged with biological sex, it has become a politicized entity where men are privileged based on ideas of [sexual differentiation](http://digitalcommons.linfield.edu/relsstud_theses/1/) \(p. 29 para. 2\). The Quran however, does not associate [biological sex](http://digitalcommons.linfield.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=relsstud_theses) with gender symbolism, nor does it describe humans in terms of gender \(p. 30 para 2\).
1.1.4.1.7.3. Pro: Ibn ‘Umar, the son of the second Caliph, [reportedly commented](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=FU4QBwAAQBAJ&lpg=PT186&ots=n-3LiiocL6&dq=%E2%80%9CWhen%20the%20Prophet%20was%20alive%20we%20were%20cautious%20when%20speaking%20and%20dealing%20with%20our%20women%20in%20fear%20that%20a%20revelation%20would%20come%20%5Bfrom%20God%5D%20concerning%20our%20behavior.%20But%20when%20the%20Prophet%20died%20we%20were%20able%20to%20speak%20and%20deal%20with%20them%20%5Bmore%20freely%5D&pg=PT186#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CWhen%20the%20Prophet%20was%20alive%20we%20were%20cautious%20when%20speaking%20and%20dealing%20with%20our%20women%20in%20fear%20that%20a%20revelation%20would%20come%20%5Bfrom%20God%5D%20concerning%20our%20behavior.%20But%20when%20the%20Prophet%20died%20we%20were%20able%20to%20speak%20and%20deal%20with%20them%20%5Bmore%20freely%5D&f=false), “When the Prophet was alive we were cautious when speaking and dealing with our women in fear that a revelation would come \[from God\] concerning our behavior. But when the Prophet died we were able to speak and deal with them \[more freely\]”. This comment reflects an admission that there was social resistance to early Islamic reforms regarding women \(Speaking in God's Name: Islamic Law, Authority and Women\).
1.1.4.1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.
1.1.4.1.7.5. Con: The oppression faced by women in diverse Islamic cultures from [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia) to [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Malaysia) indicates that even if cultural forces play a role in the institutionalization of patriarchy, Islam itself can be blamed for the manifestation of oppressive structures in many of the places it has taken root.
1.1.4.1.7.5.1. Con: While not without fault, [the Nation of Islam](https://womensenews.org/2005/08/nation-islam-women-look-and-out/) is a group of Islamic religious adherents outside the typical historical context for the spread of Islam. That group exhibits a far more progressive attitude towards women and shows the influence of cultural forces on the interpretation and understanding of Islamic doctrine.
1.1.4.1.7.6. Pro: Some parts of scripture can be understood differently when looked at through a sexist lens. It may not be a literal interpretation of the text which is the issue, but instead the time period in which it was originally interpreted and the traditions which came from these outdated interpretations.
1.1.4.1.7.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.1.4.1.7.6.2. Pro: Women are denied access to mosques in some communities due to the interpretation of the Prophet's tradition in which he stated that women should be allowed to pray from home. This was originally due to the fact that women were busy in the home with children and so they should be given more leniency in regards to the location of their prayers. [Interpreted](http://www.dar-alifta.org/Foreign/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=4825&CategoryID=5) later through a sexist lens, it turned into mosques becoming a mens only area.
1.1.4.2. Con: A role may not be the same yet be equal in its value. Equality does not necessitate having to be the same, but that the value of each person is seen to be equal in importance, and so on. Islamically the basic/default role of women and men in the world is not identical, but both are in need of each other, support each others existence and bring harmony to the society as a whole, therefore there exists equality in value.
1.1.4.3. Con: Islam does allow women to take on the roles usually filled by men, such as those of scholars, warriors, shaykhas, craft-workers and so on. There are many examples of brilliant Muslimas in the world and history.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Wikipedia \(shortened, see Gender Roles:\) "There are [many examples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Islam) of Muslimas who have played prominent roles in public life, incl. being sultanas, queens, elected heads of state and wealthy businesswomen..." \(See Female Education:\) "...each woman is under a moral and religious obligation to seek knowledge, develop her intellect, broaden her outlook, cultivate her talents and then utilise her potential to the benefit of her soul and her society."
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: If feminism is viewed as the promotion of women in leadership roles, there are early and numerous examples of women in the highest office in their state in majority Muslim countries \(since 1982\).  Nearly 40 years later, the United States has still not elected a female president.
1.1.4.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.4.2.
1.1.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.7.1.1.1.
1.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.1.6. Con: Islam treats believers of Islam and the [infidels](https://quran.com/9/29) or [apostates](https://quran.com/4/89) differently. Proscribed actions range from levying [targeted taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya) to killing.
1.1.6.1. Pro: The Quran distinguishes between the monotheistic "[People of the Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_the_Book)" \(Jews, Christians, Sabians etc\) on one hand and [polytheists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytheism) \(or [idolaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idolatry)\) on the other hand. There are certain kinds of restrictions that apply to polytheists but not to "People of the Book". For example, Muslim males are allowed to marry a Christian or Jew, but not a polytheist.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.5.3.
1.1.6.2. Pro: [Qisas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qisas#Qisas_and_non-Muslims) \(retributive justice\) is a category of crimes in Islamic jurisprudence where Sharia allows equal retaliation as the punishment. The principle is available against the accused, to the victim or victim's heirs, when a muslim is murdered, suffers bodily injury or suffers property damage. The principle of Qisas is not available as a legal course to non-muslims according to Islamic jurist literature of all Islamic doctrines of Sharia except Hanafi \(Sahih al-Bukhari 6903,Book 87, [Hadith 42](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/87/42)\).
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Jurists of different schools of Islamic jurisprudence assign [different values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diya_\(Islam\)#For_women_and_non-Muslims) to lives of non-Muslims. According to the Hanbali, Hanafi and Maliki sharia, the life of a Christian or Jew is worth half that of a Muslim, whereas Shafi'i schools of jurisprudence consider it to be worth a third that of a Muslim.
1.1.6.2.2. Pro: [The legal schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diya_\(Islam\)#For_women_and_non-Muslims) of Hanafi, Maliki and Shafi'i Sunni Islam as well as those of Shia Islam have considered the life of polytheists and atheists as one-fifteenth the value of a Muslim during diyah sentencing.
1.1.7. Con: Islam provides [detailed instructions](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/slavery.aspx) as to how to keep and treat slaves to be used for labour and for sex, so clearly it is not a religion of equality.
1.1.7.1. Pro: The Quran advocates sex with [female prisoners of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_of_war_in_Islam#Women_and_children) even if they’re married. \(Surah An-Nisa, [verse 24](https://quran.com/4/24); Surah Al-Mu'minun, [verses 5-6](https://quran.com/23/5-6)\)
1.1.8. Pro: Feminism, at its core, is equality between all sexes. This is not a view that is going to evolve or change over time, hence there is no constant race in which Islam will always be lagging behind.
1.1.9. Con: No matter how one wishes to read scripture, the implementation of Sha'aria law today in countries such as Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia strongly indicates that Islam is not rooted in equality. If it was, these inequalities would have brought an end to Islam.
1.1.9.1. Pro: According to the The World Economic Forum's [2016 Global Gender Index](http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2016/), 23 of the bottom 25 countries with the widest gender gaps are all Muslim countries which are also OIC members.
1.1.9.2. Pro: In some countries, Sharia law has been interpreted in ways that have limited the standing of women, both in terms of their [legal rights](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/182773/pdf) and in terms of [normalising violence](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/189405/pdf) against women.
1.1.9.3. Con: There is a [wealth](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/182773/pdf) of [literature](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.1086/508085.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Abc0a8d8405428c2835069bbe5c9ae49c) examining how the oppressive implementation of Sharia law does not mean that the same sources could not be interpreted in ways that promote rights of women rather than restricting them.
1.1.10. Pro: The Prophet Muhammad championed principles of [equality](http://www.ahoban.org/gender-equality-in-islam/) and egalitarianism in his last sermon where he stated, "All of you are equal. Even as the fingers of the two hands are equal, so are human beings equal to one another. No one has any claim of superiority over another. The most honored among you in the sight of God is the most righteous among you."
1.1.10.1. Con: Islam [banned polyandry, but permitted polygyny](https://salamislam.com/content/why-polyandry-prohibited-islam/3). The Prophet may have said people are equal, but he contradicted himself when he said women shouldn't have equal rights. When someone contradicts themselves, you must decide which words they really meant based on what they actually practiced, and The Prophet actually practiced inequality.
1.1.11. Con: Islamic religious doctrine promotes sexist beliefs.
1.1.11.1. Pro: [Islamic doctrine](https://islamqa.info/en/1105) prevents women from freely choosing what they want to wear.
1.1.11.1.1. Pro: A woman’s ‘[awrah](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/hijab_1.shtml)' - parts of the body which may not be visible to the public - includes her entire body. Therefore, [Islamic doctrine](https://islamqa.info/en/1105) instructs women to not uncover anything except their face and hands.
1.1.11.1.1.1. Pro: In this case, the [Quran](https://islamqa.info/en/1105) gives significantly more freedom to men with regards to how they can dress as opposed to women.
1.1.11.1.1.1.1. Con: There are examples on both sides of dressing choices one gender can make that the other can't.
1.1.11.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [While](http://islam.ru/en/content/story/dress-code-muslim-women) females have a larger area of body which must remain covered, males are not allowed to wear silk or gold.
1.1.11.1.1.2. Con: In Islam modesty is seen as a sign of [respect](http://islam.ru/en/content/story/dress-code-muslim-women) for yourself and others. Therefore the covering of a woman's body is not viewed as oppressive in Islamic culture.
1.1.11.1.1.2.1. Con: In feminism, choosing what you want to wear is a sign of individual liberties and freedom of expression. This clashes with the strict dress code of Islam.
1.1.11.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.1.1.
1.1.11.1.1.2.2. Pro: The reason that many people believe that Islam as a religion is inherently sexist is because of the head coverings women are 'forced' to wear. However, [many women](https://metro.co.uk/2017/02/21/founder-of-world-hijab-shares-what-wearing-the-hijab-really-means-for-women-6461954/) find solace and comfort in the hijab, as they can proudly and publicly identify as Muslim, as well as not being forced to comply with Western society's sexist ideas.
1.1.11.1.2. Con: Islamic doctrine prevents both men and women from freely choosing what they want to wear.
1.1.11.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.2.1.
1.1.11.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.11.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.1.1.
1.1.11.2. Pro: Islam encourages strict traditional [gender roles](https://www.al-islam.org/principles-marriage-family-ethics-ayatullah-ibrahim-amini/part-2-duties-men).
1.1.11.2.1. Pro: Research suggests that even among highly religious individuals, Muslims are more conservative in their beliefs about gender roles than their Christian or Jewish peers \([p. 7, para 1](https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/13202/ssoar-ers-2009-2-diehl_et_al-religiosity_and_gender_equality_comparing.pdf?sequence=1)\).
1.1.11.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.1.1.
1.1.11.2.3. Pro: Men are given authority over women and are considered to be their protectors and maintainers. \(Surah An-Nisa, [verse 34](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=4&verse=34); Surah Al-Baqarah, [verse 228](https://quran.com/2/228)\)
1.1.11.2.4. Pro: A woman is [required to obey](http://www.islamweb.net/en/article/149397/obeying-the-husband-is-the-key-to-paradise) her husband in everything unless he commands her to do an act of disobedience to Allah. Obedience is a right that Islam acknowledges for the husband over his wife.
1.1.11.2.4.1. Pro: This view is held by a majority of Muslims. [A survey](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-women-in-society) by Pew Research Center showed that in 20 of the 23 countries where the question was asked, at least half of Muslims believe a wife must obey her spouse \(a global median of [85% of Muslims](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/infographic-the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-and-society/)\).
1.1.11.2.5. Pro: Women bear [more responsibility](https://www.al-islam.org/principles-upbringing-children-ayatullah-ibrahim-amini/chapter-1-parents-responsibility) for the upbringing of children than men.
1.1.11.2.5.1. Pro: In Surah Luqman \([verse 14](https://quran.com/31/14)\) and Surah Ahqaf \([verse 15](https://quran.com/46/15)\), although both parents are mentioned, the mother is singled out as she bears a greater responsibility and therefore a greater reward.
1.1.11.3. Pro: The Quran states that if a husband fears disloyalty or ill conduct from his wife, he should first admonish her, then refuse to share her bed, and lastly chastise, discipline or beat her lightly. \(Surah An-Nisa, [verse 34](https://quran.com/4/34)\)
1.1.11.4. Pro: Many of Islam's main tenets are off limits to [menstruating women](https://islamqa.info/en/70438). Women on their periods cannot fast, offer the five daily prayers, circumambulate the Ka’bah, read from a copy of the Quran, or step into a mosque as they are considered impure due to a fact of their anatomy and something they don't have any control over.
1.1.11.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.4.3.
1.1.11.6. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.7.6.
1.1.11.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.1.
1.1.11.8. Pro: Islam considers women to be less intelligent than men. \(Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 6, [Hadith 301](https://muflihun.com/bukhari/6/301)\)
1.1.11.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.5.4.
1.1.11.8.2. Pro: [Hadith 301](https://muflihun.com/bukhari/6/301) also says "that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you \(women\)".
1.1.11.8.3. Con: The meaning is often [explained as](http://www.answering-christianity.com/karim/women_not_deficient_in_intelligence_and_religion.htm) a commonly misunderstood hadith.
1.1.11.9. Pro: [Quran 4:34](https://quran.com/4/34) is quite clear on this topic: man excels over woman. "Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property \(for the support of women\). So good women are the obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded. As for those from whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and scourge them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them"
1.1.11.10. Con: There are [some Islamic movements](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/berlin-s-first-liberal-mosque-its-female-leader-fight-modern-n781666) that support feminism
1.1.11.11. Pro: Woman are denied the freedom of mobility and are [not allowed to travel](https://islamqa.info/en/101520) without a [mahram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahram). Muslim men, on the other hand, have no such restriction.
1.1.11.12. Con: The Quran promotes the moral and spiritual [equality](https://nsuworks.nova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=shss_dcar_etd) of men and women by balancing virtues and rewards for both genders in identical terms; therefore, Islam is inherently gender neutral and promotes gender equality \(p. 3 para 1\).
1.1.11.12.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.1.11.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.1.11.12.3. Con: The reward in the afterlife is not balanced at all. Men get women to [use and play](https://wikiislam.net/wiki/72_Virgins) with as they wish. Women get to be [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houri) to be used and played with by men.
1.1.11.12.4. Pro: Islam is the first religion to introduce equality into society, for example \[[49:13](http://www.masjidtucson.org/submission/perspectives/women/equality.html)\] 'O people, we created you from the same male and female, and rendered you distinct peoples and tribes, that you may recognize one another. The best among you in the sight of God is the most righteous. God is omniscient, cognisant.'
1.1.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.12.
1.2. Con: Feminism presupposes particular viewpoints regarding gender and individualism. Even though Islam may/has empowered female believers, because it rejects strict individualism and essentializes aspects of gender to the soul of a person, it can be argued that Islam is not compatible with feminism.
1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.5.6.2.
1.2.3. Con: Actually individualism doesn’t necessarily have to do with feminism. [Communist feminists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism) would not agree with this definition of feminism. Communism doesn’t believe in individual decision making/gain but rather in communal decision making.
1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.4. Con: Islam, as an organised religion, is antithetical to feminism.
1.4.1. Pro: Organised religion is necessarily hierarchical to some extent, and [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_religious_leaders) is no exception. In societies and cultures which are patriarchal, those hierarchies are a method of protecting and extending male domination of society.
1.4.1.1. Pro: In societies where men typically hold and maintain power, figures of authority in organised religions will most likely be men. Thereby, women are systemically excluded from participation and decision making in a key part of society.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.4.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: A woman [corrected](https://abuaminaelias.com/dailyhadithonline/2018/02/19/umar-on-women-the-woman-is-right-and-the-man-is-wrong/) Caliph Umar, who held the highest position with regards to political authority, when he attempted to wrongfully fix the dowry. This example demonstrates that ordinary women can actively participate in the decision making process with regards to important matters that affect women, even if the figures of authority are men.
1.4.1.1.3. Con: This appears to be nothing more than 'organisations in a society will mirror society' and is not an indication that any religion and not Islam in particular is antithetical to feminism.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Organised religion tends to reflect the cultural and social biases of the society it comes from. In the process, those beliefs turn from cultural norms to religious dogma, which is much harder to question. Given that most societies are patriarchal, organised religion entrenches and reinforces cultural and social forces which oppress women through entrenched hierarchy.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: This does not mean that feminism is necessarily incompatible with Islam, only that feminism is necessarily incompatible with patriarchy, which is tautological. By this logic, as societal organisation and values become more progressive \(which they are doing, albeit gradually\) so too will organised religion.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.7.
1.4.2. Con: There is no reason why a religion, in which the followers can fulfil their roles independently from their gender identities, could not exist, even if that religion does have a hierarchical structure. A religion like that would not contradict feminist ideas.
1.4.3. Pro: [Organised religion](http://www.ksk.edu.ee/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/KVUOA_Toimetised_14_9_alar_kilp.pdf) is argued to be among the most influential factors in the construction of group identity and obligations. By creating 'in' and 'out' groups, organised religion limits people's opportunities to engage fully with themselves and others outside the limiting context of that identity. This is antithetical to feminism, which seeks to expand people's opportunities by breaking down the limiting effects of gender as well as other identities.
1.4.3.1. Pro: The movement of feminism itself is damaged by such divisions, as individuals with common cause in the liberation of women are driven apart socially and ideologically by religious identity.
1.4.3.2. Con: This amounts to saying that any human affiliation is antithetical to feminism because it can create 'in' and 'out' groups. This can apply to any sub-culture, civil society organisation, or any group of people.
1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.4.5. Con: Attitudes towards interpretations are influenced by the social and political context in which Muslims live.
1.4.5.1. Pro: The problem is social and not religious. In Egypt, until a few years ago, [leaders laughed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpfJWkNudPo) at the idea of women wearing burka.
1.4.5.2. Con: Many Muslims are living in modern peaceful countries and still hold [oppressive views against women](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law) regardless of social and political context.
1.4.5.3. Pro: Though current interpretations of Islam in several countries may include misoginistic practices, that doesn't mean that these practices are inherently part of the muslim faith. Most organized religions have also had, at one point or another, [similar practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_headcovering), which have vanished as societies change and evolve \(e.g. Europe\). Religious dogma is also affected by social and cultural change, and Islam isn't an exception, as more feminist interpretations of Islam begin to develop \(e.g. Turkey\).
1.4.5.4. Pro: Support for equal inheritance by sons and daughters is [more widespread](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-women-in-society/) in countries where laws do not specify that sons should receive greater shares \(Turkey, post-communist Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo\). By contrast, in most countries where laws specify that sons should receive greater shares than daughters, a smaller percentage of Muslims favor equal inheritance \(Jordan, Iraq, Morocco and Tunisia\).
1.4.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.7.
1.4.6. Pro: Islam literally means submission \(to God\). Feminism comes from a humanist philosophical tradition which teaches that the human individual should not be submissive towards anything.
1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.6. Pro: Islamic scripture is subject to discussion and interpretation, and its meaning evolves over time as society changes. It is only the literal reading of Islamic sources that leads to women being oppressed.
1.6.1. Con: Although interpretations might change, they have to strictly stay in line with the scripture. The scripture, however, that dates back at least over 1,400 years and therefore carries outdated ideas, cannot be changed.
1.6.1.1. Pro: According to [Islamic tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Quran#cite_note-3), the Quran is the literal word of God as recited to the prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. Muhammad recited perfectly what the angel Gabriel revealed to him for his companions to write down and memorize. Muslims believe that the wording of the Quranic text available today corresponds exactly to that revealed to Muhammad in the years 610–632.
1.6.1.2. Pro: According to [Muslims](http://www.quranreading.com/blog/islam-true-divine-belief-because-protected-quran/), the Quran is free from corruption or change because God himself has taken the responsibility of it's protection. \(Surah Al-Hijr,[15:9](https://quran.com/15/9?translations=20)\)
1.6.1.3. Con: Although the prevailing interpretation of Islam is radical, there are still [Islamic modernization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Modernism) movements.
1.6.2. Con: Evolution is only possible through dissent and criticism, and Islam does not allow either with respect to women.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Anything criticizing God, Muhammad or the Quran is considered [blasphemy in Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_blasphemy). Therefore, a debate about women might be considered blasphemous because it would involve criticizing actions of the Prophet and his companions or some verses of the Quran.
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: Although the Quran does not explicitly mention any worldly punishment for blasphemy and different schools of thought have different severe punishments, in [many cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_blasphemy#Traditional_jurisprudence) the punishment is death.
1.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: The sunnah in Sahih al-Bukhari, 3:45:687 \(and Sahih al-Bukhari, [5:59:369](http://cmje.usc.edu/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/059-sbt.php#005.059.369)\) provides a basis for a death sentence for the crime of blasphemy.
1.6.2.1.2. Con: Because Islamic feminism uses the language and ideology of Islam to argue that women need to be treated equally to men, arguing not that the Quran is wrong, but that our reading of the Quran is wrong, Islamic feminism is [harder to 'write off'](http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/indien/12314.pdf) \(p.8\), as blasphemous, than secular feminism.
1.6.2.2. Con: Growth in thought does not have to include dissent and criticism. Sometimes morals and understanding evolve with education and changing social views. Evolution is not through criticising holy texts but through understanding them in a new manner slowly over time.
1.6.2.3. Pro: Religious scholars can issue fatwas against interpreting the scripture in ways that allow women to be abused or denied equal rights. However, there have not been any broad changes made to correct practices that deny women rights on the basis that doing so would go against Islam.
1.6.2.3.1. Pro: When there is a clear course of action present which would encourage equality ignored, this reflects the feelings of those with power in the Muslim community. The lack of action to prevent interpretations of Islam from aiding in the oppression of women demonstrates a disconnect between Islam today and feminism.
1.6.2.3.2. Pro: Discussing the range of conceivable interpretations of Islam is a meaningless method by which to explain its compatibility with other ideas, because it then bears no resemblance to the way in which the religion is lived and understood in the real world. Therefore, the failure of a significant proportion of Islamic leadership and believers to act in a way compatible with feminist thought is an indictment of any compatibility between Islam and feminism.
1.6.3. Pro: The ongoing movement of [Islamic feminism](https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/17220/ISIM_21_Islamic_Feminism_and_Gender_Equality.pdf) has sought to provide an interpretation of Islamic scripture and doctrine compatible with the advancement of the position of women in society.
1.6.3.1. Con: [Critics](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/444366/pdf) of Islamic feminism have argued that in presenting an idealized notion of a feminist interpretation of scripture, the movement has failed to acknowledge and engage with the realities of gender oppressive practices in the religion and damaged the project of women's liberation in Islam as a result.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: It is not enough for feminism to accommodate women in patriarchy, or make that patriarchy less appalling, as it has been argued Islamic feminism does. \([p. 58\)](https://nsuworks.nova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=shss_dcar_etd).  Rather it is necessary that feminism seek to abolish patriarchy wholesale, in order that individuals be allowed to live their lives as they see fit, free from the constraints of gender.
1.6.3.1.1.1. Pro: Islamic feminism attempts to cater to women by making patriarchal structures less outwardly visible but in the long term this has the effect of entrenching that patriarchal structure.
1.6.3.1.1.1.1. Con: This seems to suggest that no progress that is not a complete overhaul, is not actually progress. But progress actually works gradually. By making moderate progress, you normalize your views and you establish a base you can work on. You get room to breathe, i.e. time, money, and power.
1.6.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Islamic feminism merely provides ideological frameworks, social coping mechanisms and limited legal reform, while maintaining a society in which people's opportunities are defined by gender. This has the effect of entrenching that patriarchal structure in the long term because the motivations for its complete overhaul are undermined.
1.6.3.1.1.2. Con: If seeking the total abolishment of the patriarchy is the requirement for being considered a feminist, the women's rights movement in the US was not feminist. That bar seems too high. If you support progress on women's issues, that should be enough.
1.6.3.1.1.3. Con: This viewpoint seems to be in line with [radical feminism](http://www.differencebetween.info/difference-between-radical-feminism-and-liberal-feminism) and goes against other feminist groupings such as liberal feminists, who work within the system to gain equality. As it is not a common viewpoint across all branches of feminism it should not be a prerequisite for religions to be compatible with feminism.
1.6.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.6.3.1.1.3.2. Con: Just because a viewpoint is labelled as radical, does not mean it is incorrect. If radical feminism is the most effective way for women to achieve liberation, then it is the most correct and legitimate version of feminism.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Social and political movements within Islam are slowly bringing about changes in women's rights. Activist organizations promoting change for women from within Islam include [Sisters in Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisters_in_Islam) in Malaysia, the [League of Demanders of Women's Right to Drive Cars](https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/saudi-arabian-women-campaign-right-drive-2007-2008) in Saudi Arabia, and the [Women's Aid Collective](http://theshareinstitute.org/womens-aid-collective-nigeria/) and [BAOBAB](http://www.defendingwomen-defendingrights.org/about/members/baobab-for-womens-human-rights/) in Nigeria. \(Lifting the Veil: Women and Islamic Law, [pg.26](http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1103&context=facpubs)\)
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.
1.6.4. Pro: The Quran does not provide a simple and straightforward [code of law](https://nsuworks.nova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=shss_dcar_etd), which means that various interpretations of the text can be derived from it. \(p6. par 2\).
1.6.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.
1.6.4.2. Pro: All the major monotheistic religions - Judaism, Islam and Christianity - can be interpreted as anti-feminism by a fundamentalist reading.
1.6.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.7.6.
1.6.6. Con: A literal interpretation is one possible interpretation of the texts. If a literal reading of the central texts of Islam leads to women being oppressed, then Islam is at least, in part, not compatible with feminism.
1.6.7. Pro: Islam offers scope for reinterpretation through the process of [ijtihad](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/sr125.pdf), a legal tool in Islamic jurisprudence which allows for interpretation and reasoning based on the sacred texts.
1.6.7.1. Pro: According to Amna Arshad, ijtihad was an essential tool to reforming the [Mudawana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudawana#Reforms_of_2004) \(family code\) in Morocco, and that “the drafters explicitly invoked and utilized ijtihad in their revisions, as evidenced by the radical changes to the law.” The Mudawana reforms demonstrated a vast departure from traditional Islamic law and advanced women's rights by overturning many discriminatory provisions. \(Advancing Women’s Rights Through Islamic Law: The Example of Morocco, [pg.45](https://genderlawjustice.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Advancing-Womens-Rights-Through-Islamic-Law-The-Example-of-Morocco.pdf)\)
1.6.7.1.1. Pro: According to the [updated code](https://tavaana.org/en/content/moudawana-peaceful-revolution-moroccan-women), the minimum age for women to marry was raised from 15 to 18, the same as the men's minimum age, women no longer needed to obtain approval from a guardian before marrying, men were forbidden from unilaterally divorcing their wives, women were given the right to divorce their husbands, and restrictions were imposed to make polygamous marriages harder to obtain and only with the permission of a judge.
1.6.7.2. Con: The article sighted in this claim makes clear that the process of ijtihad was abandoned 500 years ago. The article argues to revive this process but as things stand - the process is not considered valid in orthodox Islam and hence there is no clear legalistic way for Islam to modernise.
1.6.7.3. Pro: 20th Century India saw many important Muslim reformers engage in Ijtihad in order to adapt Islam to a rapidly modernising and westernising society \([Robinson, p. 260/261](http://pages.uoregon.edu/aweiss/IslamGlobalForces/RobinsonArticle.pdf)\).
1.6.7.3.1. Pro: As the Mughal Empire in India declined, ijtihad became necessary for Muslims to realise how the human will could be used to create an Islamic society without political power \([Robinson, p. 261](http://pages.uoregon.edu/aweiss/IslamGlobalForces/RobinsonArticle.pdf)\).
1.6.7.3.2. Pro: Muslim reformers in India created a broad constituency for reform in Indo-Muslim society at large, both amongst the literate classes and amongst rural village communities, indicating the popularity of movements that engaged in ijtihad \([Robinson, p. 263](http://pages.uoregon.edu/aweiss/IslamGlobalForces/RobinsonArticle.pdf)\).
1.6.7.3.3. Pro: In order to make contact with the Qur’an and Hadith afresh, the Muslim reform movements jettisoned most, if not all, of the medieval scholarship of the Islamic world \([Robinson, p. 267](http://pages.uoregon.edu/aweiss/IslamGlobalForces/RobinsonArticle.pdf)\).
1.6.7.4. Pro: Muslims around the world are [currently engaging](https://www.dawn.com/news/1141821) in ijtihad on questions as varied as whether suicide bombing is justified and whether women can lead prayers.
1.6.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.
1.6.9. Pro: Islamic laws can be [reshaped](https://nsuworks.nova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=shss_dcar_etd) to ensure that the unalienable rights for Muslim women and the egalitarian message of the Quran are not distorted and restricted by Islamic clerics whose goal is to remain in control of Muslim women’s lives \(p. 6, para 2\).
1.6.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.3.
1.6.10. Pro: [Substantial percentages](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/) of Muslims in most countries either say there are multiple interpretations of Sharia or say they do not know, as compared to those who say there is only one true interpretation.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.11.
1.8. Pro: Feminism is a broad ideology with varying viewpoints within it that exist on a spectrum. Having some aspects that are not in line with Western liberal feminism does not automatically mean that Islam is anti-feminist.
1.8.1. Pro: Many feminists are religious, or recognise how religions can co-exist alongside feminism.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Most religions do not completely adhere to feminist ideals, however they are ultimately a belief system and it is up to every individual person to decide how religion will influence their lives and how to interpret their teachings.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: While a person can decide what tenets of a religion they want to absorb, that does not mean that the religion itself is feminist. If the interpretation of every individual is taken to be representative of the religion itself, then Islam loses all of its meaningful character and beliefs, making it undifferentiated from any other belief system. This is therefore not a sensible way to judge the content of a religion's belief systems.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Malala Yousafzai is both a feminist and a Muslim. She could not be both if they weren't compatible. Therefore, they are compatible.
1.8.1.2.1. Pro: Malala fights for girls' education in Muslim countries, which got her shot in the face by the Taliban, but also a Nobel peace prize. As for her being Muslim, she describes herself as Muslim, there are no reasons to doubt her on that.
1.8.1.2.1.1. Con: This advances the argument that Malala is a Muslim. It does not advance the argument that her being both a feminist and a Muslim shows that they are compatible ideas
1.8.1.2.2. Con: Malala Yousafzai is not a credible scholar in Islamic law or history. Her beliefs do not necessarily mean anything about Islam as a whole. It is perfectly possible for a follower of a faith to hold views that are contradictory to that faith. This may or may not apply to Yousafzai. Merely being a Muslim does not make her an expert and does not mean that her opinion is of particular note.
1.8.1.2.3. Con: People are able to hold conflicting opinions.
1.8.1.2.3.1. Con: Conflict and incompatability are not quite the same thing. One person can not hold views that are incompatible with each other. That is what "incompatible" means. There is conflict between many compatible things.
1.8.1.2.3.2. Pro: Just as you can be openly gay and Christian, you can also be a feminist and Muslim. One does not necessarily have to support the other.
1.8.1.2.4. Con: Feminism is mostly a western idea. We cannot base the views of an ideology on one person, but what the consensus is among feminists.
1.8.1.3. Con: -> See 1.8.1.2.3.
1.8.1.4. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.8.1.5. Pro: As society and culture changes, religions adapt in response to popular beliefs. In this way, feminism in Islam can be a natural part of broader social change.
1.8.1.5.1. Pro: The traditions and structures in place in most major world religions were created and performed by men as they were the dominant gender. Changes to these structures happen slowly over time, however the primary belief systems, which in the majority of religions are based around goodness and peace, remain the same.
1.8.1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.7.6.
1.8.1.5.2. Pro: The ways religions reflect cultures and societies can be seen historically, in schisms/ splitting of religions \(e.g. [Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation); Orthodox, Conservative and Reform [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_religious_movements)\), in best practice guidelines changing \(e.g. \([in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khamr)\)[tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_alcohol#Islam) of [alcohol](https://www.thoughtco.com/why-is-alcohol-forbidden-in-islam-2004329) in [Islam](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/oct/08/drinkers-islam-palestinian-beerfest-alcohol), \(in\)[tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoris_laetitia#2014_and_2015_Synods_on_the_Family) of [divorce in Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_divorce), and in current divergence of religious teachings across different societies.
1.8.1.5.3. Con: As major religions, including Islam, are so old, their views on women are out-dated, or conservative. In this way, Islam will always be in tension with feminism, because its way of viewing women is always a few steps behind changing public opinion given the more regressive starting point.
1.8.1.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.
1.8.1.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.8.
1.8.1.5.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.
1.8.2. Con: While feminism comes in many forms, those forms must accept basic assumptions such as equality under the law for men and women for the word to have any meaning. As Islam contends a number of those assumptions, it fails to be compatible with feminism.
1.8.2.1. Con: This assumes that there is a universal definition for what the "pursuit of equality of all women" means.
1.8.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.1.1.
1.8.2.3. Con: Equality under the law is important because state laws, by nature, restrict freedom. This does not apply to religious laws since being part of a religion is a choice, and so it is consistent with free choice for women.
1.8.2.3.1. Con: However, in many Muslim countries leaving Islam \(apostasy\) is a legally [punishable](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/11431509/Saudi-Arabia-court-gives-death-penalty-to-man-who-renounced-his-Muslim-faith.html) offense.
1.8.2.3.2. Con: In theocracies like the Islamic ones in the Middle East, religious laws restrict freedom just as much as state laws do \(because they are still state laws\), if not more. In medieval Europe, didn't the religious laws of the inquisition restrict freedom? Islamic countries are promoting the same, if not worse, policies today. A woman was recently [arrested](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-44833088) in Saudi Arabia under Islamic law for hugging an unrelated male singer, an example of Islamic policy antithetical to the feminist doctrine.
1.8.2.4. Con: The feminist movement is inherently political, as it seeks to create fundamental change in the structure of society. Political movements must compromise with other belief systems in order to be successful in creating change. Islam is no exception.
1.8.2.4.1. Pro: Feminism has had to compromise with capitalism in order to meaningfully help the women who live in capitalist societies.["Lean in"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_In) feminism argues that for women to succeed in the corporate workplace, they should assent to corporate structures which some argue are inherently patriarchal.
1.8.2.4.2. Pro: Feminism stands the best chance of making a difference in women's lives when it has participation from a larger and more diverse group of women. Compromising with Islam allows feminism to include more women and thereby strengthens its political position.
1.8.2.4.3. Con: Political movements which compromise too many of their core values become unrecognisable. If compatibility with Islam undermines feminism to this extent, it no longer constitutes a legitimate pursuit of feminist goals.
1.8.3. Pro: Many Muslim women do not agree with the Western world’s idea of female emancipation and gender equality. Contrary to what the Western world thinks, many Muslim women living under Sharia law do not feel oppressed and live that way willingly.
1.8.3.1. Con: A large scale study of Muslim women living in predominantly Muslim countries [found](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/08/world/middleeast/08women.html) that despite women loving their religion and not feeling oppressed, they did associate gender equality with Western values and legal protections for women, and desired greater legal equality than they currently had.
1.8.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.
1.8.3.3. Pro: In [a comparative study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18229999) of religious American Christian and Muslim women, [researchers found](https://theconversation.com/islam-and-feminism-are-not-mutually-exclusive-and-faith-can-be-an-important-liberator-77086) that it was more typical for Muslim women to report that their religion supported feminism as compared to Christian women. Most of the Christian women in the study rejected the label of feminist. In contrast, the majority of Muslim women identified as feminist and identified Islam as a feminist religion. This finding is in stark contrast to the common perception of Muslim women in American society.
1.8.3.4. Pro: [A study](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lahaonline.com%2Farticles%2Fview%2F11605.htm) of thirteen Muslim countries shows that most Muslim women living under Sharia law [do not feel oppressed](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/08/world/middleeast/08women.html) and do not think it is appropriate to imitate Western values that go against Islam.
1.8.3.4.1. Pro: One of the main beliefs of feminism is the belief that women should have autonomy and choice in their own lives. If a majority of Muslim women agree with the Islamic way of life then those women are living according to their own beliefs and so are living in harmony with feminism.
1.8.3.4.1.1. Con: To hold sexist or patriarchal beliefs may also be a choice. That is not to say, however, that women who hold those beliefs are acting in line with feminism.
1.8.3.5. Pro: The Tunisian President's decision to establish equality in Tunisian women's inheritance, and abolish the law that prohibits them from marrying non-Muslim men, was [strongly opposed](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/08/17/544123358/as-tunisia-weighs-womens-rights-proposal-some-of-the-staunchest-opponents-are-wo), especially by women, who said they wanted to follow Allah's orders to the letter.
1.8.3.5.1. Con: Feminism is partially about allowing women to choose how they live their lives. Being a woman does not mean that you are a feminist, and the fact that many women oppose the law does not mean that the opposition is inherently feminist or non-feminist.
1.8.3.6. Con: Allowing women to live as they choose is a feminist ideal. Women who willingly accept Sharia are living in the bounds of feminism. If Sharia law is imposed on them, that is not feminism.
1.8.3.7. Pro: Muslims in many of the 39 countries surveyed by [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-women-in-society/#_ftn1) generally favor a woman’s right to choose whether to wear a veil in public. This view is especially prevalent in Southern and Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.
1.8.3.7.1. Con: There is [less agreement](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-women-in-society/#_ftn1) on a woman's right to choose whether to wear a veil in public in the Middle East-North Africa region, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Fewer than half Muslims in Egypt \(46%\), Jordan \(45%\), Iraq \(45%\) and Afghanistan \(30%\) say women should have the right to choose whether they wear a veil. The only country in Sub-Saharan Africa where a majority supports a woman’s right to decide is Senegal \(58%\).
