Discussion Title: Caloric restriction increases healthy lifespan in humans

1. Caloric restriction increases healthy lifespan in humans
1.1. Pro: Intermittent fasting - a key way to reduce calories - has been linked [very strongly](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/11/intermittent-fasting-may-be-center-of-increasing-lifespan/) to extended life expectancy.
1.2. Pro: Under normal physiological conditions, the use of oxygen by cells of aerobic organisms generates potentially deleterious reactive oxygen metabolites. A chronic state of oxidative stress exists in cells because of an imbalance between prooxidants and antioxidants. \[...\] Restriction of caloric intake lowers steady-state levels of oxidative stress and damage, retards age-associated changes, and extends the maximum life-span in mammals.

1.3. Con: No studies have so far conclusively measured an effect in humans
1.4. Con: Potentially negative effects on grey matter have been measured in grey mouse lemur primates. [Caloric restriction increases lifespan but affects brain integrity in grey mouse lemur primates](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-018-0024-8)
1.5. Pro: A study comparing 18 individuals who had been on calorie restricted diets for 6 years with age-matched healthy individuals on typical diets reported a significant reduction in a number of risk factors for atherosclerosis.

1.6. Con: The findings from more recent studies have suggested that the balance between micronutrients may be more important than the number of calories per se.[Macronutrient balance and lifespan](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20157561)
1.6.1. Pro: This is a well-known fact for athletes, who tend to track macronutrients very intensely.
1.7. Pro: Methionine, an essential amino acid, is responsible for the lifespan-shortening effect of full feeding. It has been suggested that methionine restriction extends lifespan by reducing signalling through the IIS pathways as lowered levels of IGF-1 and insulin are found in methionine-deficient mice.

1.8. Con: Excessive DR, extending far below ad lib levels, does not continue to yield positive effects on longevity, and instead is associated with an array of detrimental health effects, including immune deficiencies, sarcopenia and osteoporosis.

1.9. Con: Reexamination of body weight and longevity data from a study involving over 60,000 mice and rats, conducted by a National Institute on Aging-sponsored project, suggests that CR-related increase in life span of specific genotypes is directly related to the gain in body weight under the AL feeding regime.
