Discussion Title: Is Donald Trump a Good President?

1. Donald Trump is a good President
1.1. Con: He has passed very little significant legislation and has been broadly ineffective.
1.1.1. Con: Trump also removed the Obamacare individual mandate, which was the key objection of Republicans to Obamacare.
1.1.1.1. Pro: He is repealing by [executive order](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/12/politics/trump-obamacare-executive-order/index.html) elements of the Affordable Healthcare Act that is costing us a fortune.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: He followed through on his campaign promise to the electorate, restoring faith in democracy.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The USA has a very skewed version of democracy. One person's vote can be worth 2.8x someone else's depending on the state they are in. [fairvote.org](http://www.fairvote.org/population_vs_electoral_votes)
1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: He failed to replace it with anything meaningful, which means he only fulfilled half a promise.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Healthcare in America is still one of the [most expensive](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/13/us-healthcare-costs-causes-drug-prices-salaries) in the world.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: This cripples many lower and middle class families who cannot afford healthcare.
1.1.1.1.4. Con: Millions of people will lose their health insurance as a result of this repeal, many of them [will die](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/01/23/repealing-the-affordable-care-act-will-kill-more-than-43000-people-annually/).
1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: The people who will lose health insurance are those who do not want health insurance.
1.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Or who can no longer afford it.
1.1.1.1.5. Con: The Affordable Healthcare Act lowered growth of long term spending and government costs by over $1 Trillion, due to the cost controls it included. See [www.urban.org](http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/90471/2001288-the_evidence_on_recent_health_care_spending_growth_and_the_impact_of_the_affordable_care_act.pdf)
1.1.1.1.6. Con: The ACA is the law of the land. It has been challenged repeatedly and has lost every appeal. Trump's executive order undermines the ACA, therefore showing that he is not committed to supporting the laws of the country. He has not proposed a [viable](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/19/trump-health-care-better-cheaper-693362) alternative to the ACA.
1.1.1.1.7. Con: High deductible insurance is causing many people to forgo healthcare and [important medications](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/millions-skip-medications-due-to-their-high-cost-201501307673).
1.1.1.1.8. Con: There is no supporting data on how much tax payers will save. When Repeal was on the cards, many states feared they would be left footing the increased bill for ER - i.e. the cost just transfered from federal to state [tax](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-how-does-it-work-and-what-are-the-implications/)payers.
1.1.2. Con: He [secured initial funding](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/03/23/donald-trump-border-wall-16-million-funding-restrictions-attached/) for building a wall on the border with Mexico.
1.1.2.1. Con: No materialisation on getting Mexico to pay for it however.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Incorrect. [It is reported](https://youtu.be/LiaiL-dHIDQ) that the US and Mexico are in the process of finalising a trade deal that is more advantageous to the US than the current deal, which will result in more tax revenue flowing in the US government coffers.
1.1.2.2. Con: This is a budgetary matter, not new legislation.
1.1.2.3. Con: "I will build a great wall – and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me – and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.” - [No element](https://qz.com/1172972/trumps-border-wall-keeps-getting-shorter-and-more-expensive/) of this is proving truthful, and it is ostensibly arrogant.
1.1.3. Con: A president does not pass legislation. Therefore, no president has passed legislation.
1.1.3.1. Pro: US Constitution, Article I: "All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives."
1.1.3.2. Con: It is generally understood that a President passes laws through Congress. Many Presidents have passed laws.
1.1.4. Con: Trump passed the [VA Mission Act](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/06/trump-signs-law-expanding-vets-healthcare-choices/673906002/), which allows veterans to see a private doctor if they've been waiting too long for treatment.
1.1.4.1. Con: To call this 'significant' is stretching the meaning of the word.
1.1.5. Con: Trump passed the [VA Accountability Act](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/23/donald-trump-signs-va-accountability-act-law-promi/), allowing the firing of civil servants who mistreat veterans.
1.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.1.6. Pro: [A member within his administration](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html) has branded his leadership style ineffective and his actual results non-existent.
1.1.6.1. Con: The NYT op-ed is an unacceptable attack on the President, possibly from what has been termed the 'deep state': [working and briefing against the President](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html), and [attempting to thwart](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/08/peter-strzok-fired-from-fbi-over-anti-trump-texts.html) his democratic mandate. Their [anonymous, cowardly and narcissistic attacks](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/09/06/first-lady-melania-trump-condemns-anonymous-op-ed-writer-cowardly/1212385002/) have been [widely criticized on both the left and right.](https://observer.com/2018/09/why-democratic-strategist-are-slamming-the-anonymous-trump-op-ed/)
1.1.6.1.1. Con: That Melania Trump considers it to be cowardly and narcissistic does not make it so. That is her opinion only, as she has nothing to support either statement. A FLOTUS is not known for being nonpartisan or for publicly countering her POTUS’s statements. Regardless of what is going on in her head, there are clear and ever-present motivating factors shaping her responses and obvious reasons for bias.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: One potential and possible interpretation of her criticism of the article and its author, given the hostile and aggressive language used, along with lack of evidence and obvious bias and hypocrisy, creates the perception of it as coming across as nothing more than a, potentially personal, attack, and lashing out.
1.1.6.1.1.1.1. Con: An equally valid interpretation of her words and actions are that of those of someone showing righteous and rightful indignation at an aggressive and hostile campaign aimed at her husband, the POTUS, full of unproven allegations and possibly lies.
1.1.6.1.2. Con: While it is true it has been criticised on both the left and right, the reasons are wildly different. To conflate and group them together is a grave disservice to both arguments and a disingenuous way to launch an attack.
1.1.6.1.3. Con: An opinion piece in a newspaper hardly counts as a reliable source for the existence of "The Deep State"
1.1.6.1.3.1. Pro: The "Deep State" conspiracy theory came to prominence during Trump's election and campaign and has been furthered as a concept by Right Wing, Trump allied politicians, without evidence, like many other things during the Trump campaign and Presidency as a jargon slogan with no real substance to attack political opponents and make supporters scared of a bogeyman or "other".
1.1.6.1.3.1.1. Pro: For example, TDS \(Trump Derangement Syndrome\), a label Trump and his supporters commonly use.
1.1.6.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Many [therapists claim](http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/07/30/psychiatrist-debunks-trump-anxiety-disorder-says-it-partisan-pop-psychology) there is no such thing as TAD or [TDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Derangement_Syndrome) and it is instead "partisan pop psychology". It is not an [official](https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/38179-trump-anxiety-disorder), recognised diagnoses. Even if there were anxiety, many would consider it [justifiable](https://www.rt.com/uk/435026-icymi-trump-anxiety-disorder/) given the presidents actions.
1.1.6.1.3.1.2. Pro: Donald Trump frequently uses the terms "#NoCollusion" and "#WitchHunt", despite the investigation still being on-going. Thus these statements appear to be politically motivated.
1.1.6.1.3.1.3. Pro: During the Trump Presidential Campaign, he frequently led chants of "Drain the Swamp" and "Lock her up", two things he has made no serious effort to do since coming to power.
1.1.6.1.3.1.4. Pro: Fake news: Trump tends to label anything negative about himself as "Fake news", while doing nothing to discourage or attack other sources of fake news. I.E. [Pizzagate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory#Responses)
1.1.6.1.3.2. Pro: The [Deep State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state_in_the_United_States) displays all the [hall](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/conspiracy-theory) [marks](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conspiracy%20theory) of a [conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory) [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conspiracy_theories#Deep_State). And just as much [evidence](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conspiracy_theory). [Interestingly](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/conspiracy-theory), the [definition](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/conspiracy-theory) of who or what the deep state is changes based on the speaker and their goals at the time.
1.1.6.1.3.3. Con: Anonymous officials working against the president meet the definition of the deep state. The op-ed is precisely the definition of proof.
1.1.6.1.4. Pro: The "[deep state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state_in_the_United_States)" refers to "elements of government and parts of top-level finance and industry that is effectively able to govern the United States without reference to the consent of the governed as expressed through the formal political process." The anonymous author of the NYT op-ed admits to either being and/or working with unelected officials seeking to thwart the goals of the electorate as expressed through the election of Donald Trump, thus meeting the definition.
1.1.7. Pro: Trump spends [minimal time](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/the-ineffective-executive-how-trumps-laziness-is-destroying-his-presidency) doing his job, giving the impression of laziness.
1.1.7.1. Con: The alleged support for the above claim is based on anonymous sources who are presumably ill disposed towards the president for political reasons, or else they wouldn't leak to journalists, and therefore should not be taken at face value.
1.1.7.2. Con: The alleged support for the parent claim is based on the idea that someone can only do their job while sitting at their desk. This has not been true in the US since the postal service was established in [1775](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service), and remote working has become even easier in recent years, for example with the telegraph bringing an end to the pony express in [1861](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_telegraph) and the opening of telephone exchanges in [1878](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_telephone). The parent claim therefore appears somewhat questionable.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: Regardless, it is alarming to many people - so much that a mocking ['golf counter' website](https://trumpgolfcount.com/) exists - how often Trump [plays golf](https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2018/09/08/how-many-times-president-donald-trump-played-golf-in-office-103836/), at a huge cost to the American taxpayer, when he could be in office.
1.1.7.2.1.1. Pro: This also runs in direct opposition with the claims he made during the campaign that he would be too busy to play golf.[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0NZt_-eB9o)
1.1.7.3. Con: The President of the United States is afforded the luxury of a number of staff who are with him at all times, meaning that it is possible for him to work while traveling and away from the white house. Therefore the premise of the parent claim appears questionable.
1.1.8. Pro: Corporate America has reached the point of [working around](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-is-irrelevant-to-corporate-america) Trump rather than waiting for him to pass legislation that would benefit the sector.
1.1.8.1. Con: He has pushed through a revolutionary Tax Reform.
1.1.8.1.1. Pro: This also stretches tax brackets, reducing taxes on the middle class.
1.1.8.1.2. Con: It is not revolutionary. It is pretty much what every Republican president does, only more extreme.
1.1.8.1.3. Con: The Tax Reform is of undetermined value - though 37/38 economists think it is terrible, and the 38th [misread the question](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/22/37-of-38-economists-said-the-gop-tax-plans-would-grow-the-debt-the-38th-misread-the-question/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.e00556927769).
1.1.8.1.3.1. Pro: It is vital to canvass opinions from [experts in the field](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/tax-reform-2), given that Trump is not an economist and [every new measure](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2017/12/02/the-senate-passes-a-tax-bill?zid=297&ah=3ae0fe266c7447d8a0c7ade5547d62ca) seems likely to worsen America's financial situation.
1.1.8.1.3.2. Con: The [economy is booming](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trade-war-tariffs-us-economy-jobs-report-federal-reserve-g7-finance-ministers-wilbur-ross-china-a8380631.html) after the tax cut legislation, suggesting that these economists have zero predictive power.
1.1.8.1.3.2.1. Con: The economy has been booming since 2010, while the tax plan was passed at the end of 2017. This suggests that the tax cut has not yet made any difference in the economy, and that the parent claim is irrelevant. If anything, inflation has accelerated since Trump became president. [www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/188165/annual-gdp-growth-of-the-united-states-since-1990/) [www.thebalance.com](https://www.thebalance.com/unemployment-rate-by-year-3305506) [data.bls.gov](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000)
1.1.8.1.4. Con: The tax cut has boosted the Federal deficit to higher levels on top of the already high deficits imposed by the previous administration to counter the 2008 financial crash and recession. Some economists feel these deficits undermine the nations economic health.[Trump's trillion-dollar deficit](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/08/20/donald-trump-trillion-dollar-plus-deficits-fiscal-ruin-column/986236002/)
1.1.8.1.5. Pro: There are additional benefits to people that may flow from longer term macroeconomic factors, commonly known as 'trickle-down' economics.
1.1.8.1.5.1. Con: Ample [research](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/20/trickle-down-economics-broken-promise-richest-85) and [examples](https://www.thebalance.com/trickle-down-economics-theory-effect-does-it-work-3305572) have [shown](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/letters/ct-trickle-down-economics-doesn-t-work-20171124-story.html) that trickle down economics do not often [work](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-30/the-best-way-to-spur-growth-help-the-poor-not-the-rich) as intended.
1.1.8.1.5.1.1. Con: The [economy is booming](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trade-war-tariffs-us-economy-jobs-report-federal-reserve-g7-finance-ministers-wilbur-ross-china-a8380631.html), suggesting all of those sources are irrelevant.
1.1.8.1.5.1.1.1. Con: This is in spite of Trump, [not because of him](http://theweek.com/articles/786614/americas-economy-booming-trump-nothing). It is continuing to grow on the [same basic trajectory](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/01/26/that-trump-economic-boom-its-mostly-hype/) as before he took office.
1.1.8.1.5.2. Con: This assumes that you subscribe to the theory of trickle-down economics, which [many believe](http://www.faireconomy.org/trickle_down_economics_four_reasons) [doesn't work](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/20/trickle-down-economics-broken-promise-richest-85).
1.1.8.1.6. Con: The tax cuts primarily benefit the owners of capital via the businesses they own - they are, by definition, richer than the majority of working class Americans. In total dollar terms, only a marginal portion of the tax cuts benefit the so called ‘hard-working Americans’.
1.1.9. Pro: He [mishandled](https://secondnexus.com/news/paul-ryan-repeats-trump-puerto-rico/) and mismanaged the disaster relief of Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. He has since denied that was the case without evidence.
1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.
1.3. Con: Trump has low public and expert approval.
1.3.1. Pro: A [survey of 391 Political experts](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/19/opinion/how-does-trump-stack-up-against-the-best-and-worst-presidents.html) from the [American Political Science Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Political_Science_Association) ranked him as the worst president.
1.3.1.1. Con: He is much better than the alternative would have been, and so is comparatively a good President.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: This is subjective. We can't know that since Clinton was never elected President.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Hillary's campaign conspired with foreign intelligence operatives and [top Justice Department officials](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bruce-ohr-bypassed-doj-superiors-to-feed-fbi-info-from-trump-dossier-author-report) to undermine the election by funding an [unverifiable propaganda document](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump–Russia_dossier) for the purpose of undermining a presidential nominee. The conceit this shows indicates Hillary would have been a worse president.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Unverifiable in places, but [never disproved](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier). Indeed, more and more has been proven true over time, and the intelligence community has been and is investigating the allegations.
1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: It is perfectly common practise to engage in smear campaigns during Presidential elections; Trump did precisely the same thing in reverse with his nickname "Crooked Hillary". Neither shows particular moral fortitude in that area.
1.3.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Trump attempted to mount a completely falsified and embarrassing campaign to prove that Obama wasn't a US citizen. He even offered five million dollars for Obama to show his birth certificate. This type of smear campaign is easily as disgusting as Hillary's behaviour.
1.3.1.1.2.3. Con: Given the level of [Trump's own arrogance](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/donald-trump-president-wins-us-election-2016-who-is-he-life-career-quotes-hillary-clinton-a7402211.html), this is not the best line of argument. Regardless of how valid or invalid Hillary's actions were, to criticise her conceit in comparison to Trump is challenging.
1.3.1.1.2.4. Con: The initial research that preceded and, speculatively, may have later led to the Steele Dossier was actually commissioned by Republicans and later picked up by the Democrats, as the [timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier) of Republican and Democrat funding for Fusion GPS indicates.
1.3.1.1.2.4.1. Con: Christopher Steele was not hired or commissioned to work on the Steele Dossier until after the Republicans had ceased funding. As such, it is unclear how much of the initial research from their funding went into it or even would have led to it.
1.3.1.1.2.4.1.1. Con: At what point Fusion GPS decided to contract Steele is unclear. It may have been when they were still on the Republican payroll, though it is undisputed fact that his research did not begin til after the Republicans ceased payment. Maybe the Republicans even urged them to do so and promised to pay them for it when they start doing it. This however is speculation.
1.3.1.1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: However, under the assumption that when Republican funding ceased, it meant that whatever Fusion GPS were doing for the Republicans also stopped \(not an unreasonable assumption\), it can be said almost conclusively that the Republicans didn't fund the Steele dossier.
1.3.1.1.2.4.2. Con: This speculation is inconsistent with what the republican group, Free Beacon, has said. [Namely:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump–Russia_dossier)"All of the work that Fusion GPS provided to the Free Beacon was based on public sources, and none of the work product that the Free Beacon received appears in the Steele dossier. The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele."
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: Hillary ran on a platform of continuation of Obama's presidency. Therefore it is reasonable to consider that the unexpected economic and jobs boom attributable to Trump policy changes on tax and regulations would not have happened had Hillary been president.
1.3.1.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.5.1.1.1.
1.3.1.1.4. Pro: Hillary was foreign secretary under Obama, and in that time achieved zero breakthroughs with North Korea. Therefore it is reasonable to consider that the current improved dialogue and behaviour of North Korea would not have happened had Hillary been elected.
1.3.1.1.4.1. Con: North Korea is showing [no signs](https://www.38north.org/2018/06/yongbyon062618/) of slowing down their nuclear plans, despite Trump's claims that North Korea is [no longer a threat](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/13/trump-says-north-korea-no-longer-a-nuclear-threat.html). Hillary might conceivably have done better once President, it is impossible to say.
1.3.1.1.4.1.1. Con: North Korea is still in negotiations, so it does not make sense for them to give up their ace card - namely their nuclear programme - until the negotiations are complete.
1.3.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The negotiations [have been ended](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/us/politics/pompeo-north-korea-trip.html).
1.3.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: North Korea still poses a serious threat, as evidenced by [Trump's U-turn](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44584957) regarding North Korea, going from "There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea" \(which was patently untrue\) to [extending the state of national emergency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/notice-regarding-continuation-national-emergency-respect-north-korea/) in place regarding North Korea. Trump has achieved very little despite his statements to the contrary.
1.3.1.1.5. Con: The discussion question is not "Who should we have elected?" Nor is it "Would Hillary Clinton have been a better President?" This claim does nothing to support or attack the objective "goodness" of Trump.
1.3.1.1.5.1. Con: Goodness is not an objective concept. Comparison to the alternative is a perfectly legitimate metric to consider.
1.3.1.1.6. Con: Being better than an alternative does not make him "good". A better comparison would be to [past,](https://www.businessinsider.com/greatest-us-presidents-ranked-by-political-scientists-2018-2#40-andrew-johnson-5) or [historic](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-top-20-presidents-in-us-history-according-to-historians-2017-2#10-lyndon-b-johnson-11) [presidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States) such as Eisenhower, Roosevelt, Kennedy, Lincoln or Washington. [Against](http://time.com/5165686/donald-trump-last-place-presidential-greatness/)[these](https://www.lolwot.com/20-greatest-u-s-presidents-of-all-time/) [metrics](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/19/opinion/how-does-trump-stack-up-against-the-best-and-worst-presidents.html) [many](https://www.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/the-u-s-presidents-from-best-to-worst) [would](https://www.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/the-u-s-presidents-from-best-to-worst) [argue](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/these-are-the-6-best-us-presidents-all-time-24559?page=0%2C1) he [falls](http://www.icepop.com/top-us-presidents-ranked/) [far](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/presidents-ranked-from-worst-to-best-presidential-historians-survey-2017/), [far](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-worst-president-presidential-greatness-survey-presidents-day-obama-george-washington-a8218721.html) [short](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/02/16/new-ranking-of-u-s-presidents-puts-lincoln-1-obama-18-kennedy-judged-most-over-rated/).
1.3.1.2. Con: One con for this argument is that academic institutions are increasingly liberal. Therefore the "experts" are suspect in their ability to provide objective rankings.
1.3.1.3. Con: In 2014 Obama was rated as the [worst president since World War II.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2014/07/02/obama-george-w-bush-quinnipiac-poll-reagan-clinton/11985837/) Less than two years into a presidency is simply too soon to be making such pronouncements, and all this survey tells us is about the bias of the so-called "political experts" surveyed.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: The poll cited regarding Obama was not by political experts in any way or form; those with qualifications from APSA are considerably more valid than popularity contests.
1.3.1.3.1.1. Con: There is no evidence given that the views of people with 'qualifications' from the 'APSA' are more valid than those of other people on this question. Having a common qualification is however suggestive of common bias.
1.3.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Quite obviously, having a qualification in a subject is going to mean that one person knows more, and can judge considerably more accurately, the answer to a question. So yes, in terms of educated and intelligent answers, qualifications make a large difference.
1.3.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: This is not at all obvious, and in fact a ridiculous generalisation when applied to fields as subjective as politics. The bias amongst humanities subjects towards left wing ideology is [well known,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/03/02/eight-ten-british-university-lecturers-left-wing-survey-finds/) and so this result is precisely what would be predicted based on bias alone.
1.3.1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: There is no evidence given that recipients of this qualification give more objective answers to this question, or that they are notably intelligent. Their willingness to answer in this way before even Trump's first term is complete indicates the opposite is true.
1.3.1.3.2. Con: Bias may be believable in the case of a small number of respondents; nearly 400 respondents, all with political qualifications, implies a genuine negative consensus.
1.3.1.3.2.1. Con: A "political qualification" does not indicate that someone is free of bias.
1.3.1.3.2.2. Con: A genuine negative consensus is precisely what you would expect from biased people expressing cognitive dissonance.
1.3.1.3.2.2.1. Con: The referenced poll includes Democrat, Independent, and Republican scholars. In all groups, Trump was rated in the bottom five, indicating political bias was less of a factor in the results.
1.3.1.3.3. Con: This is null and void. It's an old poll. In 2018 the [same group repeated it](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/03/07/quinnipiac-poll-41-say-trump-worst-president-since-world-war-ii/404118002/) and Trump is now at the top with 41% with Obama at 21%.
1.3.1.3.3.1. Con: It isn't null and void; that isn't how polls work. This Group have rated the current sitting president at the time as the worst each time they have voted. Their views therefore appears capricious to many, and carry less weight as a consequence.
1.3.1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.2.2.1.
1.3.2. Pro: Trump has the [lowest ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating#President_Donald_Trump) presidential approval rating.
1.3.3. Pro: He doesn't seem to know what he's talking about at any given time.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Trump patently has [very little knowledge](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/17/15304212/trump-ignorant) nor experience of many issues associated with being an effective President, which is reflected in his speeches and public statements.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Trump has been actively involved on US trade and foreign policy for at [least 30 years](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ilanbenmeir/that-time-trump-spent-nearly-100000-on-an-ad-criticizing-us). Trump’s successes with domestic issues like the booming economy, and international issues like North Korea, suggest that the opinion being given in the parent claim is, at best, a gross generalisation, and at worst a partisan hatchet job by people who don’t know what talking about.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Trump's quotes on mental health more than amply demonstrate that he has [no understanding](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/donald-trump-mental-illness_us_57583b02e4b0ced23ca691b5) of the issue, folding both to stigma and misinformation.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: Many of quotes given in the support article don’t demonstrate this at all, and many people would agree with them. For example, the [link between mental illness and mass shootings.](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-duwe-rocque-mass-shootings-mental-illness-20180223-story.html)
1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: A strong causal link between mental illness and mass shootings is [demonstrably untrue](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/appi.books.9781615371099) [despite](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/9/16618472/mental-illness-gun-homicide-mass-shootings) [being a](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180509-is-there-a-link-between-mass-shooting-and-mental-illness) [common](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/minding-the-mind/201802/mass-shooting-and-the-myth-the-violent-mentally-ill) [misconception](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/politics/fact-check-parkland-gun-violence-mental-illness.html).
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: The National Alliance on Mental Illness have expressed [serious concerns](https://www.nami.org/About-NAMI/NAMI-News/2018/NAMI-s-Statement-Regarding-President-Trump-s-Recen) about Trump's attitude to mental health.
1.3.3.2.3. Pro: Trump continually draws [false parallels](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/donald-trump-devastating-mental-health-policies-rhetoric) between criminality and mental health, when this is utterly false.
1.3.3.2.3.1. Pro: [Only 3-5% of violent acts](https://namimc.org/media-perpetuating-dangerous-myth-mental-illness/) can be attributed to mental illness.
1.3.3.2.3.2. Pro: "You have people that are mentally ill. And they're gonna come through the cracks. And they're going to do things that people will not even believe are possible." - this is an example of Trump's gross misrepresentation of people with mental health problems. \([Meet the Press, 4/10/15](https://www.shortlist.com/news/most-ridiculous-trump-quotes-ever/54443)\)
1.3.3.3. Pro: Trump has said some [patently](https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/entertainment/people/donald-trump-quotes-57213) [bizarre](https://www.shortlist.com/news/the-50-most-ridiculous-trump-quotes-ever/54443), [outrageous](https://www.thoughtco.com/donald-trump-quotes-2733859), [stupid](https://friendsoftheearth.uk/climate-change/donald-trump-stupid-quotes), [and/or](https://people.com/politics/donald-trump-most-outrageous-quotes-since-taking-office/) [plain](https://www.thoughtco.com/donald-trump-quotes-2733859) [ridiculous](https://cheezburger.com/614917/funny-memes-top-10-most-ridiculous-donald-trump-quotes) [things](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/donald-trump-quotes-tweets-what-11839860).
1.3.3.3.1. Con: Many of the examples given aren’t bizarre at all, and are being deliberately misinterpreted. For example, he did not generalise that all Mexicans are rapists. Others are deliberately hyperbolic, and his unique communication style means that people who are predisposed to hating him can easily interpret them in the worst possible light.
1.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: Trump refuses to bow to political correctness: "I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct. I've been challenged by so many people and I don't, frankly, have time for total political correctness". This is potentially true, and so commendable that he refuses to bow to external pressures.
1.3.3.3.2. Pro: Trump's behaviour and character is very polarising, and he often contradicts himself or outright lies.
1.3.3.3.2.1. Con: It is only polarising because so many people are very biased. That isn't Trump's fault.
1.3.3.3.2.1.1. Con: That argument would take the whole responsibility from Trump and loads it just on the citizens. People are more biased than ever, but there is room for improvement in Trump's public behaviour. The fault isn't just on one side.
1.3.3.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: "People are biased" is a knockout-argument, you could add it everywhere where people are criticised for their behaviour, for example.
1.3.3.3.2.1.1.2. Con: The fault is probably primarily that of the media, which has discovered that [fomenting partisan conflict and outrage](https://medium.com/millennial-voices/how-the-media-may-be-contributing-to-political-polarization-4e827fc3c9c9) increases revenue.
1.3.3.3.2.1.2. Con: It's totally Trump's fault. Posting 500 insults publicly on Twitter, several hundred within his first 3 months in office, is very polarizing. That's not even counting everything he has said offline. [www.nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html)

1.3.3.3.2.2.1. Con: Bill Clinton [did](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton_sexual_misconduct_allegations) far [worse](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/11/politics/bill-clinton-al-franken-sexual-harassment/index.html) in his personal and [professional](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43218355) life and yet many seem to think he was a good president.
1.3.3.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Whether Bill Clinton did or didn't do far worse \(a specious claim\) is irrelevant to the question. in evaluating whether Trump is a Good President or not- one must decide whether moral failings are an important consideration, and if they are- weigh the evidence available. The President's [twitter history](https://www.forbes.com/pictures/flji45elmm/donald-trumps-10-most-of/#1b4cd8f570df), as well as a [well documented history of fraud](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html?module=inline) serves as compelling evidence of him being ill suited to lead the Country.
1.3.3.3.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.2.1.
1.3.3.3.2.2.3. Pro: With no personal connection to the case, Trump called for the death of 5 innocent boys \(the "central park 5"\) and then begrudged them their settlement when they were [proven innocent](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/21/donald-trump-central-park-5_n_5517784.html) years later.
1.3.3.3.2.2.4. Pro: Trump has a history of [buying influence from politicians](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/trump-buying-politicians/498749/)\(who are equally to blame\)
1.3.3.3.2.2.5. Pro: Trump was a [racist landlord](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/15/opinion/leonhardt-trump-racist.html)
1.3.3.3.2.2.6. Pro: Trump scammed thousands of people with his "[Trump University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_University)".
1.3.3.3.2.2.7. Pro: [Trump evaded hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html)
1.3.3.3.2.3. Pro: The president always seems to pivot on his views. For example, during the campaign he [described Ben Carson as a very, very special person, when he has previously compared the other candidate to a child molester](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/24/magazine/look-out-for-the-trump-pivot.html).
1.3.3.3.2.3.1. Con: This may be because Trump was initially running for office against Ben Carson, and then having won, actively reached out to mend bridges and form an alliance with his former opponent.
1.3.3.3.2.4. Pro: President Donald Trump lacks [integrity and virtue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4434789/) as evidenced by his penchant for [lying](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/).
1.3.3.3.2.5. Pro: President Donald Trump lacks credibility on the world stage due, in part, to his frequent and transparent use of [weak, unsound and fallacious arguments.](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2017-08-17/how-donald-trump-fails-logic-and-presidential-thinking)
1.3.3.3.2.6. Con: He has [removed many regulations](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/has-trump-killed-more-regulations-than-any-other-president/), in keeping with his campaign promise.
1.3.3.3.2.6.1. Con: Slashing environmental regulations is a terrible move which will lead to increased pollution, food poisoning, and so on.
1.3.3.3.2.6.2. Con: Destroying regulations that were hard won over decades and centuries does not make Trump less polarising or less of a compulsive liar.
1.3.3.3.2.6.3. Con: Removing regulations is only positive action when regulations do more harm than good. Blanket opposition to regulation can be highly destructive as many have been hard fought for and serve to protect citizens. Trump staying true to bad campaign promise doesn't make him a good President.
1.3.3.3.2.6.4. Con: The reason for his removing regulations is questionable however. If it were done to reduce bureaucracy and increase competitiveness and fairness, that would be one thing, but many feel or believe it is done to benefit big businesses and boost profits of owners and executives, such as himself and his friends and associates.
1.3.3.3.2.6.5. Con: Trump honoring one promise doesn't outweigh the numerous ways he has reneged on promises or lied during the campaign, and in office. [False Claim Count](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/08/01/president-trump-has-made-4229-false-or-misleading-claims-in-558-days/?utm_term=.81b1043098b2)
1.3.3.3.2.7. Pro: Trump may well be a pathological liar, [according to his own lawyers](https://secondnexus.com/news/trump-mueller-practice-session-lies/?utm_content=inf_10_1164_2&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=GTAK&tse_id=INF_5776e9f0b08511e8872dc93302272904).
1.3.3.3.2.7.1. Pro: Trump shows signs of extreme [narcissistic](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/the-human-beast/201608/does-trump-suffer-narcissistic-personality-disorder), [paranoia, paranoid rage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/09/06/trumps-paranoid-rage-is-getting-worse-but-the-white-house-resistance-is-a-sham/), pathological, even compulsive lying and [egomaniac](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trumps-raging-egomania/2016/09/08/252a4990-75f6-11e6-be4f-3f42f2e5a49e_story.html) personality disorders, coupled with extreme, possibly delusional, [ego](https://broadblogs.com/2017/02/24/trump-egocentrism-and-moral-ground/)-[centrism](http://www.theasian.asia/archives/98692).
1.3.3.3.2.7.1.1. Con: These are long-range, unofficial diagnoses, thus are neither reliable, nor ethical.
1.3.3.3.2.7.1.2. Con: None of these things, traits or qualities automatically make him a bad President, nor do they preclude him from being a good President.
1.3.3.3.2.7.2. Pro: [The](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/) [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/04/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-days/) has tracked him at [over 5000 lies,](https://secondnexus.com/news/donald-trump-false-statements-milestone/?utm_source=spotim&utm_medium=spotim_recirculation&spotim_referrer=recirculation) misleading or false statements in 601 days of Presidency as of Thursday the 13th of September 2018.
1.3.3.3.3. Pro: Quotes like "I have tremendous respect for women" appear laughable, given the bulk of evidence suggesting [Trump is sexist](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/donald-trump-sexism-tracker-every-offensive-comment-in-one-place/).
1.3.3.3.3.1. Pro: "All of the women on The Apprentice flirted with me – consciously or unconsciously. That’s to be expected." - this is both ridiculously arrogant, and demonstrative of casual sexism.
1.3.3.3.3.2. Pro: "I think the only difference between me and the other candidates is that I’m more honest and my women are more beautiful." - firstly, the 'honesty' is disputable, and secondly, women are not objects as suggested in this quote.
1.3.3.3.3.3. Pro: Trump told a mother, who needed a break to use a breast pump, that she was ['disgusting'](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/29/politics/trump-breast-pump-statement/index.html). This is disrespectful and adds to the perception of Trump's sexism.
1.3.3.3.3.4. Pro: "Who wouldn’t take Kate’s picture and make lots of money is she does the nude sunbathing thing. Come on Kate!" - this is another distasteful, and very sexist, comment.
1.3.3.3.3.5. Pro: He has archaic views on abortion; while being anti-abortion is valid, his belief that there should be 'punishment' for women who have an abortion is deeply problematic - so much so that it caused Trump to [clumsily retract](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment) the statement.
1.3.3.3.3.6. Pro: Trump grabs women's genitalia and therefore does not, and can not represent, half of this country. Good presidents must work for all their citizens.
1.3.3.3.3.7. Pro: Trump has selected Brett Kavanaugh, a transparently partisan individual accused of rape and perjury, for the Supreme Court.
1.3.3.3.3.7.1. Con: The accusations against Kavanaugh are flimsy and likely fabricated.
1.3.3.3.3.7.1.1. Pro: Julie Swetnick's accusation of consistent gang rape parties are almost comically insane. She has [changed her story](http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/02/guy-benson-julie-swetnick-brett-kavanaugh-allegation-nbc-news-interview), lacks even the slightest corroboration, has a less than stellar [legal history](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/3rd-brett-kavanaugh-accuser-julie-swetnick-has-history-of-legal-disputes/), and has several people who knew her attesting to her [untrustworthy character.](https://nypost.com/2018/09/26/third-kavanaugh-accusers-ex-boyfriend-once-accused-her-of-domestic-violence/)
1.3.3.3.3.7.1.1.1. Con: To call her testimony 'comically insane' is an ad hominem attack that has no bearing on whether or not it took place or not.
1.3.3.3.3.7.2. Pro: It seems [very plausible](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/2/17927606/brett-kavanaugh-perjury-lied-congress) that Kavanaugh committed perjury.
1.3.3.3.3.7.2.1. Con: In regards to the question of text messages in relation to Ramirez's accusation, Kavanaugh may have heard of the incoming accusation, even if he had no certainty it would emerge or knowledge of details. Kavanaugh could have interpreted the question of when he first heard of the accusations as when he had heard of the details. Another possibility is that Kavanaugh's legal team were the ones involved in the text messages. Without the texts themselves, it is not clear either way.
1.3.3.3.3.7.2.1.1. Con: His claims to not know her outside of University however were shown to be false. They were bridesmaid and Groomsman at a wedding together and are pictured together in a photo.
1.3.3.3.3.7.2.2. Con: On the subject of drinking, Kavanaugh admitted to drinking too much, but claimed never to have "blacked out", referring to an alcohol-induced period of amnesia. Whether he experienced a black out is almost entirely a case of his own state of mind, and so impossible to prove.
1.3.3.3.3.7.2.2.1. Con: He also says he never drank underage. The legal drinking age at the time was 21. He was 18. It's a small issue, but you'd think someone familiar with the law would realise it.
1.3.3.3.3.7.2.2.2. Con: He carefully qualified that he never blacked out from drinking beer, and evasively never acknowledged or denied a possibility of blacking out from liquor, wine, or any other intoxicant.
1.3.3.3.3.7.2.3. Con: In terms of the yearbook slang, despite modern definitions differing from Kavanaugh's account, we have evidence that [boof can refer to flatulence](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/brett-kavanaugh-meaning-of-boof/), we have testimony and other yearbook entries that refer to FFFFF as an inside joke and devil's triange as a game.
1.3.3.3.3.7.2.3.1. Con: We also have testimony from some of his other "friends" and classmates that he lied about these definitions, the same with Rentate Alumnus.
1.3.3.3.3.7.2.4. Con: In the case of the stolen democratic emails, this is a question of a state of mind. If Kavanaugh claims that he did not notice their origins, proof is required. Perhaps a documented reference to the stolen emails as stolen would suffice, but none have appeared. As such, this does not meet the grounds for perjury.
1.3.3.3.3.7.2.5. Pro: He claimed that he didn't have time for parties and never attended any. His own calendar shows at least 2, if not 3 in that one month.
1.3.3.3.3.7.3. Pro: Justice Kavanaugh clearly committed perjury when explaining the meaning of a [Devil's Triangle](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Devils%20Triangle) while under oath during the Senate hearing of his nomination.
1.3.3.3.4. Pro: "Any negative polls are fake news" is an alarming statement nodding towards the conspiracy theory of 'fake news'. For any statesman to outright deny anything that contradicts their worldview - regardless of legitimacy - shows a lack of professional integrity. It is conceivable that negative polls exist, and are accurate.
1.3.3.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.1.4.
1.3.3.3.5. Pro: "We are going to have an unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout for the inauguration" was a statement of sheer arrogance, particularly ironic in retrospect given [how few turned up](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/21/14347298/trump-inauguration-crowd-size).
1.3.3.3.5.1. Pro: And even more arrogant, and amusing to those with anti-Trump leanings, that Trump [stole a photo](https://www.gq.com/story/trump-steals-obama-inauguration-photo) from Obama's inauguration to make it appear as though his attracted a larger crowd.
1.3.3.3.6. Pro: "Ariana Huffington is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man – he made a good decision" - personal insults of this manner come across as petty, unpleasant and unbecoming of a statesman, regardless of whether anybody perceives it as true.
1.3.3.3.6.1. Pro: "If I were running ‘The View’, I’d fire Rosie O’Donnell. I mean, I’d look at her right in that fat, ugly face of hers, I’d say ‘Rosie, you’re fired.’" - similarly, to call anybody 'fat' and 'ugly' is not the conduct one expects from a public figure.
1.3.3.3.6.2. Pro: He did the same with [Hillary Clinton](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-via-twitter-hillary-clinton-cant-satisfy-her-husband-2015-4?IR=T), with "If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America". Campaign or not, this is very crude and problematic from a statesman.
1.3.3.3.6.3. Pro: Similarly with Rand Paul: "I never attacked him on his looks, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there."
1.3.3.3.7. Pro: "When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending people that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bring crime. They’re rapists…" - this is outright racist, to generalise an entire racial group in such negative terms.
1.3.3.3.7.1. Pro: This is also [inaccurate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/30/upshot/crime-immigration-myth.html). Immigration and criminality are not correlated as Trump would like.
1.3.3.3.7.1.1. Con: He's talking about illegal immigration which is by definition criminal. It is therefore accurate.
1.3.3.3.7.2. Con: This quote does not generalise to all Mexicans, because Trump was expressly only talking about the subset of Mexicans who choose to illegally sneak into the US, saying that they are not the best Mexico has to offer.
1.3.3.3.7.2.1. Con: To generalise any group - even passingly - as rapists is unacceptable.
1.3.3.3.7.3. Con: This quote does not even generalise to all illegal Mexican immigrants, because the quote that has been truncated to cut out the part where he says he assumes some of the illegal immigrants are good people.
1.3.3.3.7.3.1. Con: Trump has been known to generalise in other incidents in the past too. For example in light of the protests and counter-protests in [Charlottesville](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-defends-white-nationalist-protesters-some-very-fine-people-on-both-sides/537012/), he tarred both sides with the same brush, equating the protesters of ANTIFA on the left, with [White Supremacists and Neo-Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally) on the right. This drew a lot of criticism of Trump.
1.3.3.3.7.3.1.1. Pro: The rally was organised by Richard Spencer, a white supremacist. The Rally was a a white supremacist,antisemitic, white separatist, and neo-fascist rally. Protesters were members of the far-right and included self-identified members of the alt-right, neo-Confederates, white nationalists, Klansmen, neo-Nazis, and various militias.
1.3.3.3.7.3.1.1.1. Pro: Trump later amended his statement to say that there were "some fine, very fine people, on both sides.", again a sweeping generalisation. These comments were seen by critics as implying moral equivalence between the white supremacist marchers and those who protested against them, and were interpreted by many as a sign that he was sympathetic to white supremacy.
1.3.3.3.7.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Although there were undoubtedly some innocent and/or peaceful protesters on the right, many of he marchers chanted racist and antisemitic slogans, carried semi-automatic rifles, swastikas, Nazi symbols \(such as the Odal rune, Black Sun, and Iron Cross\), the Valknut, Confederate battle flags, Deus Vult crosses, flags and other symbols of various past and present anti-Muslim and antisemitic groups. Because of this, many feel he has said there are "very fine" Neo-Nazis/Nazi sympathisers.
1.3.3.3.7.3.1.2. Pro: In his first statement on the Rally, Trump did not denounce white nationalists explicitly, instead condemning "hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides".
1.3.3.3.8. Pro: "One of they key problems today is that politics is such a disgrace. Good people don’t go into government." - this is deeply ironic, and thus fairly ridiculous.
1.3.3.3.8.1. Con: This is a widely held belief, and it is unclear what is bizarre or ridiculous about this quote.
1.3.3.3.8.1.1. Con: What is ridiculous is the person who said it went into politics himself.
1.3.3.3.9. Pro: "I’ve said if Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I’d be dating her." - unsurprisingly, many people have found this actively alarming, for obvious reasons.
1.3.3.3.10. Pro: "[The point is, you can never be too greedy](http://uk.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-business-philosophy-from-the-art-of-the-deal-2015-6)." - this is self-explanatory insofar as Trump's moral standards and priorities.
1.3.3.3.11. Pro: "My Twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth." - this is an example of a ridiculous \(and arrogant\) statement, insofar that it is neither true nor likely to ever be true. It also continues to propagate conspiracy theories about Trump's perceived 'enemies'.
1.3.3.3.12. Pro: "My IQ is one of the highest — and you all know it! Please don’t feel so stupid or insecure; it’s not your fault." and "I'm intelligent. Some people would say I'm very, very, very intelligent." are two quotes that demonstrate arrogance and have no backing; in fact, analysis has suggested that Trump speaks at the level of an [8-year-old](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-language-level-speaking-skills-age-eight-year-old-vocabulary-analysis-a8149926.html).
1.3.3.3.12.1. Pro: [Trump](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-us-flag-wrong-colour-blue-stripe-a8508556.html) managed to [colour](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2018/aug/27/trump-new-american-flag-russian-twist-us-president-drawing-children-ohio) the [American](https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-globally/donald-trump-colours-us-flag-wrong-gets-trolled-online-5328891/) [flag](https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/27/donald-trump-used-the-wrong-colour-while-drawing-the-american-flag-7885223/) [wrong](https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/27/donald-trump-used-the-wrong-colour-while-drawing-the-american-flag-7885223/)/[incorrectly](https://www.firstpost.com/world/twitter-has-a-field-day-as-donald-trump-adds-wrong-colours-to-american-flag-during-visit-to-ohio-childrens-hospital-5059221.html). And later, it appeared to some that he was trying to covertly copy off a little girl beside him.
1.3.3.3.12.2. Pro: Trump claims to be "[A very stable genius](https://www.indy100.com/article/trump-very-stable-genius-nato-uk-visit-8443776)", but refuses to allow himself to be independently tested on this.
1.3.3.3.13. Pro: "I was down there, and I watched our police and our firemen, down on 7-Eleven, down at the World Trade Center, right after it came down” - mistake or not, to wrongly post in public about such a huge disaster is problematic for a President.
1.3.3.3.13.1. Pro: Trump's statements regarding 9/11 have been [very disrespectful](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-bizarre-quotes-911-attacks-tallest-building-higher-ratings-muslims-cheering-george-w-a8530571.html) and at points seemingly self-serving.
1.3.3.3.13.1.1. Pro: This includes saying that he believes he "could have stopped it" through immigration measures, which is both implausible and disrespectful to the victims.
1.3.3.3.14. Pro: He also has attributed "'Make America Great Again" to himself, despite it being Reagan's campaign slogan. \([MyFox New York, Mar 2015](https://www.shortlist.com/news/most-ridiculous-trump-quotes-ever/54443)\)
1.3.3.3.15. Con: Not all of these quotes are wrong; Trump has said "I have a great relationship with African Americans, as you possibly have heard. I just have great respect for them. And they like me. I like them." \(Anderson Cooper 360, 23/7/15\) - which is increasingly true, with [opinion polls](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/08/16/trump-approval-rating-african-americans-rasmussen-poll/1013212002/) showing vastly elevated African-American support now since his election.
1.3.3.3.16. Pro: His statement “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries coming here?” \(White House meeting, 11/1/18\) is prejudicial and inappropriate for a President.
1.3.3.3.17. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.3.3.4. Con: This is hardly an unusual trait amongst politicians.
1.3.3.5. Pro: Trump has [no understanding of climate change](https://friendsoftheearth.uk/climate-change/donald-trump-stupid-quotes).
1.3.3.5.1. Con: This claim appears based on a quote by trump saying that “"It used to not be climate change. It used to be global warming. That wasn't working too well, 'cause it was getting too cold all over the place." That is true. The phrase global warming was dropped because it didn’t accurately describe what was happening in all areas of the globe.
1.3.3.5.1.1. Con: During the [interview in question](http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/news/president-trump-fake-news-climate-change/), Trump demonstrated a lack of understanding of the Paris Climate Change agreement, and indeed climate change; it is not one misunderstanding, but a collection thereof.
1.3.3.5.2. Con: Climate science is exceptionally complicated, and anyone who says they fully understand all the variables and how they interact is lying. Therefore it is not unreasonable to express skepticism.
1.3.3.5.2.1. Con: There is the nuanced understanding of a professional, and a complete lack of even the basic fundamentals. It is alarming that Trump - who is in a position to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement - is so patently not in possession of even basic facts.
1.3.3.5.3. Con: Trump, like most politicians, is not a scientist, and very few politicians have a reasonable understanding of climate change. There is a reasonable debate to be had about how resources should best be allocated to deal with climate change, and implying people who disagree are stupid is inherently unhelpful.
1.3.3.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.5.2.1.
1.3.3.5.4. Pro: Statements like "It's really cold outside, they are calling it a major freeze, weeks ahead of normal. Man, we could use a big fat dose of [global warming](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/656100109386674176?lang=en)!" illustrate his lack of understanding.
1.3.3.5.5. Pro: Trump once attempted to argue that "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive" - there is no evidence for this.
1.3.3.5.6. Pro: Trump has denied climate change is a lasting problem and believes it will "[fix itself](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/15/itll-change-back-trump-says-climate-change-not-a-hoax-but-denies-lasting-impact)", countering science and blaming scientists for having their own "[agenda](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45859325)".
1.3.3.6. Pro: His statements [regarding Brexit](http://uk.businessinsider.com/trump-doesnt-understand-brexit-or-basic-trade-policy-2017-7?r=US&IR=T) suggest he has limited understanding.
1.3.3.7. Pro: Trump thinks Trade Wars are [good things](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-01/trump-is-said-to-delay-decision-on-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs) and[easy to win](http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-china-trade-fight-20180625-story.html). This shows a [flawed](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/07/why-donald-trumps-trade-war-will-fail/564605/) [understanding](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-trade-war_us_5ac53929e4b09ef3b2432f64) of [economics](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/donald-trump-seems-confused-about-whos-paying-for-his-trade-war).
1.3.3.8. Pro: [Trump](https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2018-03-15/trump-admits-making-up-trade-claim-in-trudeau-talk) [often](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2018/03/15/trump-falsely-claims-us-has-trade-deficit-with-canada-admits-making-up-facts/) does not know if Trade deals are [good](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/15/trump-canada-trade-deficit-465464) or [bad](https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2018/03/15/trump-admits-fabricating-trade-deficit-with-canada-in-meeting-with-trudeau/), or [run](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/15/donald-trump-admits-made-up-facts-justin-trudeau) at a [surplus](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-responds-trumps-trade-1.4577493) or [deficit](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/15/593844812/trump-admits-to-making-up-trade-deficit-in-talks-with-canadian-prime-minister) and [makes it up](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/03/14/in-fundraising-speech-trump-says-he-made-up-facts-in-meeting-with-justin-trudeau/) [as he goes along](http://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-admits-to-having-no-idea-if-us-had-trade-deficit-with-canada/2018/03/15/b7d36ed6-286d-11e8-a227-fd2b009466bc_video.html). [Essentially](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/trump-repeats-false-claim-about-canada-after-admitting-uncertainty-over-figure.html), [he](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/15/17123880/trump-canada-trade-surplus) [dissembles](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-trudeau-1.4577179).
1.3.3.8.1. Pro: He also makes bizarre statements regarding trade deals, like "When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China, in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time."; Trump offers no evidence to back this up, and indeed it's unclear quite what he means. \([15/6/15](https://www.shortlist.com/news/most-ridiculous-trump-quotes-ever/54443)\)
1.3.3.9. Pro: Donald Trump's grasp on nuclear proliferation and nuclear fission [is cause for concern among many experts.​](http://fortune.com/video/2018/01/03/trumps-history-with-nuclear-weapons/)
1.3.4. Pro: Trump scores 11 of a possible 14 on a Fascism score chart [greenerblog.blogspot.com](http://greenerblog.blogspot.com/2017/02/is-trump-fascist.html)
1.3.4.1. Con: The link I have provided shows that America is virtually a fascist country to begin with. The leader of each party has an obligation to the party and not to the whole country as you would expect in a democracy. There is no attempt at unifying the country for either side that’s why so few laws get passed unless there is a majority government. Points 1-8 [mises.org](https://mises.org/library/good-fascists-and-bad-fascists)
1.3.5. Con: It is not uncommon for presidents who end up being popular to go through periods of unpopularity and polarisation. For example, Trump's approval rating is [the same as Reagan's](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo) at this point \(20 months\) in his presidency
1.3.6. Con: It is impossible to judge public approval of Trump by media charts and ‘expert’ panels. Before the election, the media made it look as though Trump had little public popularity when compared with Clinton. This was proven false by the voter outcome.
1.4. Con: Trump damages popular and public opinion of the United States, diminishing its standing and prestige in the eyes of the World.
1.4.1. Pro: Trump is [disrespectful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyBKS-rV4eE) towards [foreign](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/us/trump-walks-front-queen-elizabeth.html) [leaders](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-video-trump-shocks-britain-by-cutting-off-queen-elizabeth-1.6270919) and [heads of state](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/14/17571986/trump-walks-in-front-of-queen).
1.4.2. Con: Trump moved the [Embassy to Jerusalem](http://uk.businessinsider.com/us-embassy-move-to-jerusalem-trump-fulfills-promise-2018-5?r=US&IR=T); this was a bold move to strengthen America's standing globally.
1.4.2.1. Con: Neither of these acts have increased USA's standing in the world. For a great part of the world it is considered controversial at best and inflammatory at worst.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: Controversy does not affect whether an act is positive or negative in the medium to long term.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Moving the US Embassy means that it no longer be a point of contention in peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: This is patently false. Moving it to Jerusalem means the US is no longer seen as neutral or a good faith actor by the Palestinians and it only serves to heighten and inflame tensions.
1.4.2.3. Con: The US embassy move was a personal decision by Trump that had less to do with governance of the USA and more to do with reelection. Basically, Trump green-lighted Israel to keep harassing, murdering and pushing back on the Palestinians.[cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/10/opinions/five-myths-jerusalem-embassy-move-miller/index.html)
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Trump naming Jared Kushner \(whose family has strong ties to Israel\) senior adviser to the president may have been done to curry favour with those who support Jewish interests or Israel’s interests.
1.4.2.4. Pro: Moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem shows that the US is not afraid and is truly [committed to peace](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/12/27/should-the-us-embassy-be-moved-from-tel-aviv-to-jerusalem/moving-the-embassy-to-jerusalem-shows-that-the-us-is-committed-to-peace) in Jerusalem - there would be no reason to place US ambassadors in jeopardy otherwise.
1.4.2.4.1. Con: In that case, it shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation in Israel and of the grievances of the Palestinians. Or a complete lack of care and interest. Either way, it does not speak highly of US foreign policy and engagement, nor the Administration.
1.4.2.5. Con: Moving the Israeli embassy is a short-sighted policy that de facto ends the two state solution, perpetuates the Israeli-Palestinian conflict indefinitely and rules out the USA as an objective broker in the peace process.
1.4.3. Pro: Donald Trump consistently, whether with intent or not, creates a bad image of America and its citizens by creating “tweet storms” on Twitter on various topics while making statements that could only be described as unpresidential.
1.4.3.1. Con: The 'storm' is created by media frenzy, not the tweet itself. The [bias of the media](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/10/22/jimmy-carter-media-has-been-harder-trump-than-predecessors/788558001/) necessitates direct communication with the electorate and the world.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Many of his [actual tweets](https://www.complex.com/life/worst-donald-trump-tweets/no-love-for-trump) are offensive, grammatically questionable and/or plain bizarre.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: The media and Trump himself are both responsible for the "Trump cloud" we live in. Trump is less presidential in behavior than preceding presidents, but on the other hand the media is more fired up and prone to exaggeration than ever. This is a more plausible explanation than only making just one of these two responsible.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: The 'storm' is created by the sheer number of people and organizations he has personally attacked and alienated. [www.nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html)
1.4.3.1.3. Pro: The press is controlled by [few people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership) that can dictate what gets published.
1.4.3.1.3.1. Con: The United States has many large national [independent newspapers](http://independent newspapers) and the White House press corps [represents many more national and international news sources.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_press_corps#Correspondents)
1.4.3.1.3.2. Con: By far, the most damning international reportage of Trumps lies and failings is [his](https://twitter.com/DonTrumpsTrump) [own](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump/) [Twitter feed](https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump)
1.4.3.1.4. Pro: Donald Trump has illuminated the bias of media, so we Americans can make more informed decisions about the information we are using.
1.4.3.1.4.1. Con: Trump gets bad press because most journalism is biased towards finding truth, whereas he [tells so many lies.](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/)
1.4.3.1.5. Con: [Trump often tweets what he sees on Fox News](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/08/22/a-peek-inside-trumps-twitter-bubble-in-the-wake-of-the-worst-day-of-his-presidency/) or his Twitter feed. That is what creates the storm as one would really hope that the POTUS has better sources of information.
1.4.3.1.6. Con: A [tweetstorm](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/tweeting-up-a-tweetstorm) is a series of related tweets posted by a Twitter user in quick succession. Nobody in the press or elsewhere makes Trump do that.
1.4.3.1.7. Pro: The media is almost exclusively liberal. Therefore, any republican president is going to be portrayed as negative. We saw the same thing with Bush.
1.4.3.2. Con: He has created a positive image of America in some areas that have traditionally shown derision and hatred towards the US. For example, [North Korea](https://www.ft.com/content/82df7074-7522-11e8-aa31-31da4279a601)
1.4.3.3. Con: Twitter is not a reflection of the US nor the rest of the world.
1.4.4. Pro: Donald Trump's antics, crude behaviour, and apparent dim-wittedness are unbecoming of a President, and as a result, global respect and admiration for US leadership has [never been lower.](https://www.newsweek.com/global-respect-us-leadership-dropped-sharply-under-trump-opposite-happened-784298)
1.4.5. Con: This statement assumes that standing and prestige in the eyes of the world is more important than efficient management of governmental agencies and services \(including immigration\) in the USA.
1.4.5.1. Con: The value of "standing and prestige" stands on its own legs \(ceteris paribus\) and the claim fails logically without also presenting an argument that the standing and prestige is mutually exclusive to efficient management of governmental agencies and services.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: While true that standing and prestige stand on their feet, I see no reason to warrant an argument that standing and prestige is mutually exclusive to efficient management. And that is because standing and prestige are too abstract as qualities to quantify management or be used as a factor for it. The perspective of a person's standing and prestige differs from person to person and is too easily manipulated. For said reasons, I do not think that they matter for management.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: "Standing and prestige" are related to foreign policy and negotiations with other countries. A decrease in standing/prestige indicates poor foreign policy and hinders negotiations.
1.4.5.2. Con: Trump is not bringing "efficient management of governmental agencies and services"
1.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.2.
1.4.7. Pro: Trump has expressed the desire to violate international rules agreed to for decades at the Geneva Conventions by allowing his Troops to torture prisoners claiming it is necessary for security when in fact it damages, not only our security but our image. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions)
1.4.8. Pro: Trump's attempts to reduce both [legal](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/07/politics/legal-immigrants-daca-trump/index.html) and [illegal](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2018/05/08/report-says-trumps-immigration-crackdown-breeding-climate-fear) immigration appears [inhumane](https://delawarestatenews.net/opinion/letter-to-the-editor-u-s-treatment-of-asylum-seekers-is-inhumane/), and clearly [racially motivated](https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/6/19/17478970/trump-family-separation-immigration-policy-racism), to the degree that it is liable to have [a damaging impact](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/01/09/trumps-crackdown-on-legal-immigration-is-hurting-america.html) on America's future.
1.4.8.1. Con: His immigration crackdown is more likely motivated by a desire to enforce the law, which is a core duty of the President. Certainly this is what Trump has repeatedly [said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-acting-enforce-law-keeping-families-together/).
1.4.8.1.1. Con: His family separation policy is actually against the law. [www.nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/world/americas/us-un-migrant-children-families.html)
1.4.8.1.2. Con: If we knew Donald Trump's motivation and you were correct, this would be a strong claim; however, motivation is a difficult thing to discern, a priori . The truth is, we do not know Donald Trump's motivation. Moreover, [we cannot believe what he says](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/) most of the time, so his documented statements are of little use in determining what his motivations are.
1.4.8.1.3. Con: This is wholly speculative, Trump's motivations are unknown to anybody but himself.
1.4.8.2. Con: The crackdown on immigration from certain countries with significant internal problems with terrorism has been [ruled constitutional](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44619976), and so is neither inhumane nor racist.
1.4.8.2.1. Con: That it was ruled constitutional does not actually mean it can't be racist or inhumane.
1.4.8.2.1.1. Pro: Upon the constitutions founding, black people were worth [3/5ths](http://www.blackpast.org/aah/three-fifths-clause-united-states-constitution-1787) of a person. Many policies after the civil war have continued to either outright discriminate, or have been used overtly in discriminatory fashion.
1.4.8.2.2. Pro: The constitution [protects human rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_the_United_States), and so for it to be ruled constitutional means that it is not an abuse of human rights.
1.4.8.3. Con: Trump is also calling for an overhaul if the immigration system to make it [merit-based](https://www.us-immigration.com/blog/trumps-raise-act-proposes-merit-based-immigration-system/) rather than lottery-based. This will make it easier for businesses to attract International talent, and is liable to have a very positive impact on America's future if implemented.
1.4.8.3.1. Con: The primary effect of this policy will be more competition for well-paying jobs, likely with lower wages as a result.
1.4.8.3.1.1. Con: There will be many effects, and the above claim is a gross simplification. The policy will bring much-needed skills into the country which will boost wealth for everyone in the long run. It will also increase wages for low skilled jobs as employers will be less.ablr to rely on illegal immigrants who are willing to work for less money for a variety of reasons.
1.4.8.3.2. Con: As a candidate who is unreliable and [often](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/) [lies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/12/anatomy-trump-rally-percent-claims-are-false-misleading-or-lacking-evidence/?utm_term=.3cb2328191c5), the fact the policies he's gone forward with on immigration tell much more than the policies he says he intends to go forward with.
1.4.8.3.3. Con: And yet he has called for reducing the number of H1-B visas - highly qualified people who should have a lot of merit.[fortune.com](http://fortune.com/2017/01/14/congress-h1b-immigration/)
1.4.8.4. Pro: The impact of his 'zero-tolerance' policy, with increased levels of familial separation and unacceptable human rights abuses, is [very clear](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/my-son-is-not-the-same-new-testimony-paints-bleak-picture-of-family-separation).
1.4.8.4.1. Con: The clear impact is that America is slowly but surely [stemming the flow of criminals into the country](https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report/2017/iceEndOfYearFY2017.pdf).
1.4.8.4.1.1. Con: The numbers shown are [actually lower than previous years.](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/about/offices/ero/pdf/2013-ice-immigration-removals.pdf) This means that the policies are having no noticeable or observable effect and that if anything, the previous administration could take the credit.
1.4.8.5. Pro: Trump makes [false and misleading claims](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/04/trumps-chain-migration-fable/) about chain migration.
1.4.8.5.1. Con: The claims may be exaggerated but are directionally correct. The idea of having a lottery to let people into a country is questionable and Trump is right to criticise it.
1.4.8.6. Con: There is no evidence his policies are any more brutal, inhumane or racially motivated that [Obama's](http://uk.businessinsider.com/migrant-children-in-cages-2014-photos-explained-2018-5), given Obama isolated children from their parents and kept those children in cages. Trump is simply [more effective](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/ice-deportation-arrests-soar-under-trump-administration-drop-border-arrests-n826596) at dealing with people who have criminally entered the country.
1.4.8.6.1. Con: Obama and Trump [did not](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/19/matt-schlapp/no-donald-trumps-separation-immigrant-families-was/) have the same policies.
1.4.8.6.2. Con: Trump is also separating families who have entered the country legally. [www.aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/cases/ms-l-v-ice)
1.4.8.6.3. Con: At least this claim accepts the inhumanity. But it doesn't dispel it.
1.4.9. Pro: Trump seems unwilling to stand up to, or take a stand against, Foreign governments, even when they murder American residents.
1.4.10. Con: The large number of migrants currently making their way to US borders to gain US residency suggest people from other countries desire to live in a country under President Trump. [www.nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/world/americas/migrants-caravan-mexico.html)
1.5. Pro: Under Trump, the USA is experiencing the lowest unemployment since 2000.
1.5.1. Con: This is a trend that was [present in the previous administration as well.](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/unemployment-trump-was-born-third-base-thinks-he-hit-triple/amp) There is no reason to believe that Trump's policies have anything to do with the continuing trend.
1.5.1.1. Pro: [This chart](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000) shows what the unemployment numbers actually are. They have fallen about 1% point each year since 2011, this trend is continuing. The only difference is now Republicans are agreeing with the numbers instead of saying they are not accurate, when Obama was in office they denied the numbers were accurate and repeated and repeated that lie so many times people actually believed it.
1.5.2. Con: The current good economy is the result of a business cycle that runs largely independent of presidential policies.
1.5.3. Pro: Black unemployment rates are [historically low](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/black-unemployment-falls-to-second-lowest-on-record-2018-09-07).
1.5.4. Pro: Female unemployment is at the [lowest rate for 65 years](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-female-employment-sorry-women-i-let-you-down-again-1098500).
1.5.5. Pro: Hispanic unemployment rates are at [historic lows](https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/craig-bannister/hispanic-latino-unemployment-rate-hits-lowest-level-record-june).
1.5.6. Con: This claim is based on the logical fallacy that because one event occurred after another, it was caused by it.
1.5.6.1. Con: While correlation does not prove causation, it is a step in proving causation, and therefore cannot be completely ignored
1.5.6.1.1. Con: Correlation and causation are completely separate, and you cannot draw causation based on the currently available data.
1.5.7. Con: Economic indicators do not necessarily prove when a president is doing well. President Obama entered office during the economic crisis and throughout the majority of his first year was dealing with large unemployment. The suggestion that a president can directly control and manipulate the American economy and is 100% responsible for its success and/or failure is a ludicrous assumption. Economic arguments for the success of a president are based as much on partisanship as cold data.
1.5.8. Con: Even assuming that [lower unemployment is a result of Trump's](https://www.businessinsider.com/obama-trump-gop-economy-job-growth-report-2018-9) actions during his relatively short time in office \(specious\)- wealth inequality is increasing, and wages when adjusted for inflation are stagnant. More employed citizens is good, but it matters whether these new jobs provide live-able wages. A stronger economy ought to mean real benefits for average families- not just those at the top. Supporting articles and Evidence: [UN Report](http://undocs.org/A/HRC/38/33/ADD.1), [forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2016/11/12/what-a-trump-administration-might-mean-for-income-inequality/#592ce4ca3a78), [newrepublic.com](https://newrepublic.com/minutes/151188/growing-inequality-trump-era), [businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-economic-agenda-is-exacerbating-americas-inequality-crisis-2018-8).
1.5.9. Con: Trump's claim of responsibility for very low unemployment rates in the USA \(3.7% a/o Sept. '18\), is misleading and overstated. As evidence, unemployment rates are at record lows in many other countries as a result of a long global expansion that followed the financial crisis. Many of these have policies directly contrary to the President's. Thirty-six countries have rates lower than the USA, including Japan \(2.4%\), Germany \(3.4%\), Mexico \(3.4%\), Poland \(3.5%\) and Hungary \(3.6%\).
1.5.10. Con: The President's claim of job creation as evidence of his success is overstated at best. Job growth has been continuing on the trend in Obama's 2nd term, albeit at a slower pace. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, job growth averaged 182k per/mo. in 2017, which was lower than 2013, '14, '15 and '16 and avg. 2018 growth of 208k \(through Sept\), was lower than '15 and '16. If the POTUS claim that his tax cuts created jobs, it is not evident in jobs numbers. [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0000000001?output_view=net_1mth)
1.6. Pro: Trump's stewardship and policies have led to historic economic achievements across a number of different metrics.
1.6.1. Pro: The economy is experiencing high GDP growth, [currently at 4.2%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-gdp-growth-revised-up-in-second-quarter-1535546347), which contrasts against the recession [being predicted](http://robertreich.org/post/136616314155) by some economists.
1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.3.2.
1.6.2. Pro: U.S. Small Business Optimism just hit its [highest level in history](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-11/u-s-small-business-optimism-at-record-high-on-hiring-spending)
1.6.3. Pro: Wall Street has set a record for the [longest bull run in history](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/22/wall-street-record-longest-rally-history-bull-market).
1.6.3.1. Con: There is no apparent connection - proven or even speculated - between the current Wall Street boom and any decision or policy made by Donald Trump.
1.6.4. Con: Some [Analysts](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-presidents-economic-decisions-matter-eventually/) and [Economists](http://fortune.com/2017/07/20/donald-trump-economy-stock-market-jobs-reports-credit/) argue that it takes 2 or more years for presidential decisions to have a noticeable effect on the economy, outside of crisis situations.
1.6.4.1. Pro: This implies that the results can be attributed to Obama, not Trump.
1.6.5. Pro: Consumer confidence has surged to an [18 year high](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/29/us-economy-second-quarter-revised-report-figures).
1.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.
1.6.7. Con: Under Hitler, Nazi Germany experienced a massive revival and uplift in its [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#Recovery_and_rearmament). This did not make him a good President. By the same metric, these do not make Trump a good President.
1.6.8. Pro: America’s biggest companies are reporting some of the [strongest earnings growth since the recession](https://www.wsj.com/articles/profits-surge-at-big-u-s-firms-1533489995).
1.6.8.1. Con: The biggest companies doing well on the backs of the rest of us is precisely the problem.
1.6.9. Con: This is a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. Simply because there have been positive economic occurrences during the Trump presidency does not mean Trump caused them, and in fact, [evidence shows](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/24/17759940/donald-trump-economy-jobs-growth-obama) them to be the continuation of [long-term trends](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/jul/27/fact-checking-donald-trumps-points-about-economy/) that pre-date him.
1.6.10. Con: Trump has a [17th century](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-trade-policy-is-stuck-in-the-80s--the-1680s/2018/05/31/f8e2f7c2-6510-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html?utm_term=.fbfab00f21c7) zero-sum view of international trade which is [refuted](http://theconversation.com/trumps-exports-good-imports-bad-trade-policy-debunked-by-an-economist-94625) by [economists](https://qz.com/894085/donald-trumps-mercantilist-trade-policy-was-debunked-by-economist-adam-smith-more-than-200-years-ago/) of [all](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/opinion/leadership-laughter-and-tariffs.html) [stripes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-zero-sum-worlds-of-trump-and-sanders-1458504854).
1.6.11. Pro: The Executive Branch with PDT at the helm is [slashing bloated regulations](https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/two-months-to-go-regulatory-budget-progress/). At last count for FY 2018, 47 regulations were cut & 10 new regulations were created for a ratio of 1:4.7 creating a YTD savings of $621.5M in taxpayer dollars.
1.7. Pro: Trump's foreign policy achievements demonstrate he is a good President.
1.7.1. Con: Something that seems to be good for the USA in the short term does not necessarily mean it is good for the USA in the long term.
1.7.2. Pro: He has taken far more punitive action against Russian malign behaviour than Obama ever did.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Under Trump, US military killed 200 Russian soldiers [for crossing into US-controlled land in Syria](http://www.newsweek.com/us-military-killed-200-russians-syria-airstrikes-pompeo-says-trump-considers-883947)
1.7.2.1.1. Con: The presence of US troops in Syria is a [violation of international law](https://richardfalk.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/contra-syria-attack/) because neither the UN Security Council nor the government of Syria authorized them to be there. Russia, on the other hand, is there legally because the government of Syria invited them to be there.
1.7.2.2. Pro: Trump authorized the [sale of lethal weapons](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-weapons-ukraine-20171222-story.html) to the Ukraine.
1.7.2.2.1. Con: The weapons aren't being used. [theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/05/ukraines-successful-courtship-of-trump/559526/)
1.7.2.3. Pro: Some of the [toughest ever sanctions](http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/397212-president-trump-is-tougher-on-russia-in-18-months-than-obama-in-eight) on Putin's allies in Russia have been put in place while Trump, not Obama, was president.
1.7.2.3.1. Con: The sanctions mentioned were not the work of Trump. The sanctions "upheld" in January 2017 were [originally imposed by Obama](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/29/barack-obama-sanctions-russia-election-hack), and those from August 2018 were pushed through by a [veto-proof majority](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/us/politics/fact-check-pompeo-sanctions-russia.html) in Congress.
1.7.2.3.1.1. Pro: Trump has [seemed](https://www.dw.com/en/us-congress-pushes-for-new-russia-sanctions-after-election-meddling-intel/a-44951543) [extremely unwilling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/30/even-if-trump-is-blatantly-ignoring-the-russia-sanctions-law-theres-not-a-lot-congress-can-do-about-it/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f4091ff72524) to [impose sanctions](https://www.vox.com/2017/7/29/16061878/trump-russian-sanctions-sign) on Russia.
1.7.2.4. Pro: Trump bombed Syria for crossing US red lines whereas Obama [allowed red lines to be crossed without consequence](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/15/17238568/syria-bomb-trump-obama-russia), greatly weakening the US.
1.7.2.5. Con: Trump received [massive criticism](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-today-07-19-18/h_3761f1662b0836600ef8a508fa63f563) [from the Intelligence community](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/7/16/17576804/trump-putin-meeting-john-brennan-tweet-treasonous) for [taking Putin's side on Russian election meddling](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/17/629601233/trumps-helsinki-bow-to-putin-leaves-world-wondering-whats-up) at the Helsinki summit.
1.7.2.6. Con: Trump [repeatedly ignores](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/16/putin-told-trump-russia-never-meddled-in-us-election.html) the [intelligence community's assessment](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/16/us/elections/russian-interference-statements-comments.html) that Russia meddled in our election.
1.7.2.7. Con: Trump changed the GOP platform to be [friendlier to Russia](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/04/568310790/2016-rnc-delegate-trump-directed-change-to-party-platform-on-ukraine-support).
1.7.2.8. Pro: Obama proved comparably weak, potentially even underhanded, through his dealings with Russia.
1.7.2.8.1. Pro: Obama allowed alleged [Russian interference](http://Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections) in the US election. Rather than taking decisive action, all Obama did before the election was to [privately ask Putin to stop](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/15/629281975/fact-check-did-the-obama-administration-respond-to-election-interference-by-russ), apparently to no avail, demonstrating his weakness.
1.7.2.8.1.1. Con: Trump also allowed alleged Russian interference in the US election. In fact, he took the decisive action of [publicly](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/13/politics/trump-asked-russians-to-get-clinton-emails-they-immediately-started-trying-/index.html) [asking](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/us/politics/trump-russia-clinton-emails.html) [Putin](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-asked-russia-to-find-clintons-emails-on-or-around-the-same-day-russians-targeted-her-accounts) [to hack](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/us/politics/trump-russia-clinton-emails.html) the [DNC servers](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/russia-hack-clinton-emails-mueller-probe-indictment-trump-latest-a8446626.html) \([which they promptly did](http://uk.businessinsider.com/trump-russia-emails-hack-clinton-same-day-mueller-2018-7?r=US&IR=T)\).
1.7.2.8.1.2. Con: Such effective means of hacking elections via social media influence were completely unforeseen by anyone in the federal government, much less Obama.
1.7.2.8.1.3. Con: Criticism of voting machine security had been [raised for years](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/24/us/computer-voting-is-open-to-easy-fraud-experts-say.html) before Obama.
1.7.2.8.1.3.1. Con: Voting machine security is irrelevant to the 2016 election as there is no allegation that votes were tampered with.
1.7.2.8.1.3.1.1. Con: This question of whether votes were actually tampered with is unknowable. [22 states were targeted by Russia](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/22/electronic-voting-state-hacking-russian-government-cyber-actors/), and some were breached.
1.7.2.8.1.3.2. Con: Obama was in a position of power and authority to implement and oversee changes and improvements to voting machine security and did nothing throughout the 8 years of his presidency
1.7.2.8.1.3.2.1. Con: It's the responsibility of the States to manage and run federal elections, not the federal government.
1.7.2.8.2. Pro: Obama allowed Russia to [annex Crimea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation).
1.7.2.8.2.1. Con: The only alternative would have been to oppose Russia with military force, which might cause a global conflict akin to a "WWIII"
1.7.2.8.2.2. Con: Russia never asked anyone for permission to invade another country. They just did it.
1.7.2.8.3. Pro: Obama's public rhetoric on Russia was tough, but in private he "secretly cooperated" with [Russia](https://www.wsj.com/video/obama-medvedev-hot-mic-gaffe/5F7CF09D-CFD5-4805-A72C-3378D5F8371E.html) by implying that he would make concessions after his re-election due to the additional "flexibility" he would have once he was no longer accountable to the public.
1.7.2.8.3.1. Con: This is an overstatement. [Obama offered no concessions](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nuclear-summit-obama-medvedev/obama-tells-russias-medvedev-more-flexibility-after-election-idUSBRE82P0JI20120326), but simply asked for space, as it was "an election year in both countries \[...\] clearly not a year in which we are going to achieve a breakthrough" - Ben Rhodes re: the comments.
1.7.2.8.4. Con: Obama worked with Europe to place sanctions on Russia after it invaded Crimea, Trump [tried to lift them](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-wanted-to-lift-russia-sanctions-days-after-taking-office-2017-6).
1.7.2.8.5. Con: What Obama did or didn't do has no bearing on whether Trump is a good President, unless one wants to define Trump by Obamas actions. The question is "Is Trump is a good President? not "Is Trump better than Obama?"
1.7.2.8.5.1. Pro: This is [what-about-ism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/whataboutism-origin-meaning).
1.7.2.8.5.2. Pro: We would need quantitative data to make a useful comparison; e.g. how many sanctions, how many Russian oligarchs hurt, how much Russian money affected.
1.7.2.8.6. Con: Russia cyber-attacked the US because of Obama's sanctions. We're still, even now, in the midst of Obama's tough stance on Russia.
1.7.2.9. Con: Trump has resisted placing sanctions on Russia even when they have been passed and pushed for by Congress and the Senate.
1.7.2.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.8.4.
1.7.2.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.3.1.1.
1.7.3. Con: Trumps actions, words and rhetoric have alienated many of America's traditional allies: [Canada](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/trump-slams-canada-on-twitter-suggests-replacing-nafta-with-separate-deals-1.3954972), [Britain](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/05/politics/trump-nra-speech-angers-french/index.html), [Australia](https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/malcolm-turnbull-donald-trump-pena-nieto/index.html), [Japan](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-abe-pearl-harbor-remember-ripped-trade-1093230), [Europe](https://nationalpost.com/news/world/trump-attacks-europes-refugee-policies-falsely-says-crime-in-germany-is-way-up), most other members of [NATO](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/07/09/donald-trump-slams-nato-allies-military-spending-ahead-leaving/). This soured opinion and relationship is unlikely to be in America's best interests in the long run.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Trump's actions have also weakened ties with other countries, creating a space for other global powers such as [China](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/us/politics/us-latin-america-china.html) to replace the US.
1.7.4. Con: Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement, sending a message to allies that the U.S. won’t honor its commitments and doesn’t care about addressing the problems caused by climate change. It is against U.S. interests to send such a message to allies.
1.7.4.1. Con: The Paris Accords were intrinsically flawed requiring much less from our global peers, including China which puts out far more pollution than the US. Withdrawing from the accords demonstrated that bad deals were unacceptable. Furthermore "climate change" advocates have been caught red-handed lying as demonstrated by the email scandal of 2011. Climate change often comes with advocacy of socialistic policies which will put a lot of money into bureaucratic pockets. [forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2011/11/23/climategate-2-0-new-e-mails-rock-the-global-warming-debate/), [www.investors.com](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/climate-change-a-back-door-to-communism-and-the-united-nations-admits-it/)
1.7.4.1.1. Con: The email scandal \(both of them\) were [fully investigated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_conspiracy_theory) and no evidence of wrong doing was found. In fact, many have suggested that it was a hoax and tried to portray Climate change as a conspiracy theory for political and economic ends.
1.7.4.1.2. Con: The [Paris agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) was voluntary, with requirements set by the signatory nations themselves and thus placed no specific commitments on any member. If anything, as a bigger net polluter, China would have higher and hard targets to meet.
1.7.4.1.3. Con: There were mechanisms for withdrawing from the agreement and while Trump has nominally followed the notification, in practice, he has ignored them completely, showing the US administration in general and Trump in particular, cannot be trusted.
1.7.4.2. Con: For the Paris Accord to have been a 'US commitment', it should have been submitted to Congress for approval. [Obama declined to submit it to Congress for approval.](https://dailycaller.com/2017/06/03/obamas-decisions-doomed-the-paris-climate-accord-to-failure-in-the-us-experts-say/)
1.7.5. Con: A lot of the results of these have yet to be seen. Meanwhile, his immigration policies have caused human rights abuses. He has recently reversed his zero-tolerance policy.

[www.justice.gov](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1049751/download)
1.7.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.
1.7.5.2. Con: -> See 1.4.8.6.
1.7.5.3. Con: These "human rights abuses" were pre-existing policies from the Obama Administration & the Clinton Administration. Reference: Flores Consent Decree 1997. This reversal of the zero-tolerance policy could be considered a "pro" as it pertains to human rights.
1.7.6. Pro: He is challenging China's [unfair trade practices](https://www.industryweek.com/trade/it-time-stand-china).
1.7.6.1. Con: -> See 1.6.10.
1.7.7. Pro: He has dramatically lowered tensions with North Korea.
1.7.7.1. Pro: North Korea has not tested a nuclear weapon since [September 2017](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea).
1.7.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.4.1.
1.7.7.1.2. Con: Despite this, National Security Adviser [John Bolton](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/north-korea-has-not-taken-steps-to-denuclearize-john-bolton-says/2018/08/07/9a560ac0-9a51-11e8-8d5e-c6c594024954_story.html), claims N.Korea have taken and made [no steps](https://thebulletin.org/2018/07/north-korea-is-not-denuclearizing-yet/) towards denuclearization.
1.7.7.1.2.1. Pro: In fact, there is [intelligence](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa/north-korea-making-bomb-fuel-despite-denuclearization-pledge-pompeo-idUSKBN1KF2QT) to suggest they are [continuing](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/if-north-korea-denuclearizing-why-it-expanding-nuclear-research-center-n887056) [to make fuel](https://qz.com/1344277/north-korea-working-on-new-missiles-despite-denuclearization-pledge/) for nuclear weapons.
1.7.7.1.2.2. Pro: [Experts](https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-07-27/denuclearization-not-going-happen-says-north-korea-expert) [do not believe](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/02/politics/north-korea-denuclearization/index.html) N.Korea will [Denuclearise](http://www.atimes.com/article/time-to-get-real-north-korea-will-not-denuclearize/).
1.7.7.1.3. Con: They just had some kind of problem with their test site [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/26/north-korea-nuclear-test-site-collapse-may-be-out-of-action-china)
1.7.7.2. Pro: North Korea has been engaged in negotiations and dialogue with the US, exchanging [very warm letters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa/north-koreas-kim-asks-trump-for-another-meeting-in-new-letter-idUSKCN1LQ2E3) between the two leaders.
1.7.7.2.1. Con: That Trump seems on close terms with a known dictator is not necessarily a good thing. Many could perceive this as dangerous or alarming.
1.7.7.3. Pro: North Korean media has [toned down](https://www.ft.com/content/82df7074-7522-11e8-aa31-31da4279a601) anti-US rhetoric.
1.7.7.4. Pro: North Korea has not fired a missile towards Japan since [November 2017](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_North_Korean_missile_tests).
1.7.7.4.1. Con: -> See 1.7.7.1.3.

1.7.7.5. Pro: Trump has [halted](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/29/trump-says-no-reason-for-military-exercises-with-south-korea-despite-stalled-nuke-talks-with-north.html) provocative military exercises with South Korea.
1.7.7.5.1. Con: [He did so unilaterally without consulting S.Korea](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-agreed-cancel-south-korea-war-games-without-informing-military-972322). [Much](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/12/us-to-suspend-war-games-with-south-korea-donald-trump-kim-jong-un-north-summit) to the [consternation](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/12/politics/trump-us-military-war-games-south-korea-intl/index.html) of [S.Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/world/asia/trump-military-exercises-north-south-korea.html) and [Japan](https://www.stripes.com/news/mattis-reassures-japan-that-alliance-is-firm-amid-concerns-over-canceled-war-games-1.535335), [two](https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/tokyo-concerned-over-trump-cancellation-of-war-games-1.739710) of America's [traditional](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/12/u-s-south-korea-military-drills-are-vital-japans-defense-chief.html) [allies](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/06/30/national/japan-bothered-ramifications-u-s-halt-korean-war-games/), somewhat [straining](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa/in-surprise-summit-concession-trump-says-he-will-halt-korea-war-games-idUSKBN1J72PM) relationships with them.
1.7.7.5.1.1. Con: South Korea deviated from a common US-Japan-SK line first when they [invited the North to the Olympics](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/south-korea-invites-north-korea-to-cooperate-on-olympics/2018/01/02/61d4f42c-e110-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b5a918e970e7) in spring 2018.
1.7.7.5.2. Con: Trumps stated reasoning's are often inconsistent and at times contradictory: For instance, with regards to North Korea and war games in South Korea, he himself has indicated this was for [economic reasons](http://time.com/5309627/president-trump-why-war-games-end/), not just, or possibly even primarily, diplomatic ones, depending on how you interpret his statements.
1.7.7.5.2.1. Con: Trump has also stated it was because they were provocative: "We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money, because number one I think it’s very provocative. I want to do it and I think they’re \[North Korea\] very happy about it because it is so provocative.”
1.7.7.6. Pro: North Korea [has returned](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44976947) the remains of US soldiers slain in the Korean war.
1.7.7.7. Pro: North Korea [returned three US hostages](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles/three-americans-freed-by-north-korea-head-home-thank-trump-idUSKBN1IA08I)
1.7.7.7.1. Con: They also tortured Otto Warmbier to death and sickeningly transferred him out of their custody only for him to die within days.
1.7.7.7.1.1. Con: This is [highly disputed](https://www.axios.com/otto-warmbier-north-korea-torture-death-09de0093-0412-448c-8216-670103f98646.html).
1.7.7.8. Con: It was South Korea that took the first steps to lower tensions.
1.7.7.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.5.1.1.
1.7.7.9. Con: North Korea continues to develop nuclear weapons violating UN sanctions.[bbc.com](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45067681)
1.7.7.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.4.1.
1.7.7.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.1.2.
1.7.7.10. Con: According to some experts, he has [made the situation worse](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/27/north-korea-us-now-worse-off-than-before-trump-kim-summit---expert.html).
1.7.7.10.1. Con: [Victor Cha](http://time.com/5294880/south-north-korea-ambassador-talks-summit-victor-cha/) disagrees here and gives credits to Trump for the ongoing negotiations.
1.7.7.11. Con: The tensions between North Korea and South Korea \(and the US\) have eased because of [North Korea's new found leverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEoZLGHKvy8&t=410s), not because of Trump's negotiation tactics, or name-calling strategy.
1.7.7.11.1. Pro: North Korea is getting what they bargained for by developing nuclear war capabilities: a seat at the international table, being recognized as a regional power-player, greater economic freedom, and mitigated regime change goals from external forces.
1.7.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.
1.7.9. Pro: Trump withdrew from the [Iran Deal](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/8/17326650/iran-nuclear-deal-withdraw-trump-speech-goldberg-interview).
1.7.9.1. Con: Withdrawing from the Iran deal has primarily negative consequences for the USA \(and the world\).
1.7.9.2. Con: Trump withdrew from the Iran deal, a deal that was ensuring Iran would not get a nuclear weapon, one of the most ill-advised and unnecessary moves in a long time.
1.7.10. Pro: Withdrew from the Paris Climate Deal \(which we were only following\), which [benefits the USA financially](https://www.atr.org/obamas-paris-agreement-all-cost-and-no-benefit-us).
1.7.10.1. Pro: This saves the US billions in trying to stop the [unstoppable](http://theconversation.com/if-we-stopped-emitting-greenhouse-gases-right-now-would-we-stop-climate-change-78882) and allows us to focus on more pratical things like space research and [escaping to Mars](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/there-s-only-one-way-for-humanity-to-survive--go-to-mars-/).
1.7.10.1.1. Con: This is a foolish and short term argument. The original article referenced doesn't say it is unstoppable or unavoidable, only that the target is unrealistic. It still argues however that we need to slow global warming to give ourselves more time to adapt and survive. The Paris accord, which Trump unilaterally withdrew from, was a step in that direction, to buy time for future generations.
1.7.10.2. Con: Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement has primarily negative consequences for the USA \(and the world\).
1.7.10.2.1. Pro: -> See discussion #15487: The US should not have pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement
1.7.10.3. Con: The United States, like all other countries in the agreement, was able to set its own goals, and decide the value of its fines for not reaching said goals. Pulling out of the agreement was a symbolic move against global cooperation towards mitigating future risk.
1.7.10.3.1. Pro: An ounce in prevention is worth a ton in reaction.
1.7.11. Pro: Trump is not a warmonger. He made clear he does not want a nuclear confrontation and will not react hastily to provocative actions made by other nations. "The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles offshore right out of the water," Trump said, referring to a Russian spy vessel that has been lurking off Connecticut, not far from a key Navy submarine base. "Everyone in this country's going to say, 'Oh, that's great!' " Trump said. "It's not great." [www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/16/president-donald-trump-says-getting-along-with-russia-is-a-good-thing.html)
1.7.11.1. Con: Trump's friendliness with Putin is [not a good thing](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/7/17/17577476/trump-putin-meeting-intelligence-win).
1.8. Con: He has certainly not shown good judgement and/or the managerial ability to build and maintain a stable administrative team around him, which is a negative reflection of him as a President.
1.8.1. Con: The results he has achieved thus far, considered by many to be quite impressive, suggest that the relatively high turnover in his administrative team is not an important metric and should not reflect negatively on his Presidency.
1.8.1.1. Con: There is no reason to credit Trump with those "good results". GDP has been rising since 2010, unemployment has also been dropping since 2010, which if anything suggests that "Obama was a Good President." Moreover, North Korea still shows no sign of slowing down its nuclear program. [www.38north.org](https://www.38north.org/2018/06/yongbyon062618/)
1.8.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.
1.8.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.
1.8.2. Pro: The unbelievable rate of firings and/or resignations in his team is [unprecedented](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/16/us/politics/all-the-major-firings-and-resignations-in-trump-administration.html).
1.8.2.1. Pro: Trump has given roles in his administration to his son, his daughter and his son-in-law. Despite [evidence](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45079377) that two of them may have [committed](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/27/opinions/how-cohen-claim-could-affect-trump-callan/index.html) potentially criminal [wrong doing](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-russia-investigation.html) and [potentially](http://fortune.com/2018/07/28/trump-donald-jr-russia-meeting/) even [illegal](https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/11/politics/trump-jr-legal-problems/index.html) [acts](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-worried-about-legal-trouble-for-trump-jr_us_5b6656aee4b0b15abaa3e7da), [Trump](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/400414-trump-fears-trump-jr-may-have-accidentally-gotten-in-legal-trouble) [keeps them](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/donald-trump-jared-kushner-ivanka-white-house) while releasing others. This may be a sign of [Nepotism](https://patch.com/us/white-house/nepotism-white-house-how-trumps-family-bigger-liability-his-twitter-feed), hardly an effective management style.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: It also raises [conflict](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/18/why-donald-trumps-family-being-in-the-white-house-is-problematic-explained/) of [interest](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-family-members-have-gotten-much-richer-president-moved-white-house-975993) issues.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Conversely a bad leader refuses to admit or acknowledge mistakes and would not fire even critically inept staff. There are members of his [team](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/letat-cest-trump/526431/) that [Trump](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-problem-that-the-U-S-President-demands-personal-loyalty-Doesnt-demanding-personal-loyalty-set-up-impossible-conflicts-for-those-officials-between-state-and-leader-agendas) [refuses](https://www.newsweek.com/ronny-jackson-veterans-affairs-secretary-donald-trump-865025) to fire or replace [due](http://theconversation.com/why-does-a-president-demand-loyalty-from-people-who-work-for-him-95199) to [their](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/06/donald-trump-loyalty-staff-217227) [personal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/02/01/what-trump-really-means-when-he-demands-loyalty/) [loyalty](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/06/07/trump-personally-asked-to-end-fbis-flynn-investigation-comey-says-contradicting-trumps-claim.html) to [him](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/8/15759568/comey-testimony-loyalty-psychologists).
1.8.2.3. Con: A significant portion of Trump's fame is derived from his penchant for saying"[You're fired](https://youtu.be/CHzdxly0Y9Q)", and so it is hardly unbelievable that he has fired people at a faster than normal rate.
1.8.2.3.1. Con: Running the Presidency like a reality TV show is hardly likely to be seen as the hallmark of a "Good" President.
1.8.2.4. Con: Trump was elected with a mandate to 'drain the swamp' and change the way politics operates, and so it would be surprising if he did follow precedent. He has an electoral mandate to be unprecedented, and it is therefore a sign that he is fulfilling his pledge to the American people.
1.8.3. Con: Good leaders know when to make managerial changes. The job of a productive POTUS is fast-paced. If he made bad picks, he's figured out quickly how to fix and replace those appointments.
1.8.3.1. Con: [Trump](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/candidate-trump-promised-best-people-cabinet-50183308) [has](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2016/09/15/trump-ill-choose-the-best-people-for-my-administration.html) [invited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRV5HdfMZMM) [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-14/trump-s-vow-to-hire-the-best-people-isn-t-panning-out) [Criticism](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Trump) [of](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2017/12/29/hires-best-people/) [himself](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/sep/12/trump-promised-to-hire-the-best-people-he-keeps-hiring-the-worst-nasa-is-next) [however](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru0NOAp8y9M) [by](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/14/14609348/trump-hire-best-people) [his](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/13/politics/donald-trump-jeff-sessions-omarosa/index.html) [own](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/08/14/why-are-so-many-people-trump-hires-corrupt-incompetent-and-immoral/) [words](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/opinion/trumps-best-people-are-the-worst.html) [and](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/04/13/the-best-people-trump-personnel-picks-haunt-him/NDRUo7qgUNFMSSTcA7ZDWL/story.html) [his](https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/opinion/times/story/2018/aug/19/all-presidents-best-people/477174/) [appointments](https://www.denverpost.com/2018/08/24/trump-surrounded-by-best-people/).
1.8.4. Pro: Trump's cabinet choices were chiefly opponents of the offices they hold. They are corruptive forces. Several campaign managers are in prison for various crimes, and even Trump's family is under suspicion. [www.npr.org](https://www.npr.org/2018/04/03/599145343/epa-chief-pruitt-faces-mounting-scrutiny-for-ethics-violations) [www.edfaction.org](http://www.edfaction.org/scott-pruitts-web-fundraising-and-lawsuits) [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson) [www.insidesources.com](http://www.insidesources.com/point-trumps-education-plan-defund-devalue-privatize-school-system/) [www.cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/15/politics/judge-sends-paul-manafort-to-jail-pending-trial/index.html) [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Page#Foreign_policy_and_links_to_Russia)
1.8.4.1. Con: With over 40k sealed indictments its fair to say he is trying to tackle systemic corruption like no other. 
[Indictments Master List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kVQwX9l9HJ5F76x05ic_YnU_Z5yiVS96LbzAOP66EzA/edit#gid=1913036486)
1.8.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.8.
1.8.4.2. Con: [It has now been shown that the Russia FBI investigation into him was politically motivated.](http://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/395776-memos-detail-fbis-hurry-the-f-up-pressure-to-probe-trump-campaign)
1.8.4.2.1. Con: That as may be, [nineteen people and three companies](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/23/donald-trump-fbi-spy-claims-robert-mueller-russia-investigation) have been indicted. There was genuine corruption to be found, regardless of motive.
1.8.4.2.1.1. Con: None of these indictments relate to the campaign, so the conclusion of genuine corruption is false
1.8.4.2.2. Con: That assertion was jumped to by a partisan Republican party, but the investigation is still underway and individuals tied to the campaign are pleading guilty.
1.8.4.2.2.1. Con: No, it is evidenced by the clearly biased [actions and motives](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/13/politics/peter-strzok-fired-fbi/index.html) of Clinton idealogue Peter Strzok abusing his position in the FBI to further his political agenda, for which he's been fired.
1.8.4.2.2.1.1. Con: The investigation was called for by thousands of citizens, congressmen, political opinion writers, and more, months before anyone knew Peter Strzok's name.
1.8.4.3. Con: Being opponents of the actions previously taken in the name of the offices they hold is not corruptive, but rather essential in a healthy and functioning democracy.
1.8.4.3.1. Con: This is anti-democratic, flying in the face of countless thousands of sections of law, undermining the democratically documented will of the republic.
1.8.4.3.2. Con: This strategy is a massive waste of tax payer dollars. The programs that are being undermined were never de-funded.
1.8.4.3.3. Con: It is neither essential nor healthy to legalize polluting the air and water in our shared environment.
1.8.4.3.4. Con: Selecting a supreme court justice based on his previous comments that the president should not be held accountable for any crime is explicitly corrupt.
1.8.5. Con: It is unclear whether his managerial style shows good judgement, as there are [two completely different stories](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/09/09/pence_woodward_book_a_complete_misunderstanding_of_how_this_white_house_works_its_not_for_everybody.html) on the goings on in the White House. A negative picture is painted by anonymous people who can't be held to account or people with [little credibility](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/omarosa-has-no-credibility-but-liberals-love-her-because-she-hates-trump), while a positive picture is painted by everyone else who works or has worked there.
1.8.5.1. Con: [Bob Woodward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Woodward) is neither anonymous \(though admittedly, his sources are\), nor lacks credibility.
1.8.5.2. Con: We have three difference sources for the conflict and turmoil in the White House at this point, and that is ignoring the individual stories, soundbytes and testimonies from various individuals at various times. The Big Three are the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Fear-Trump-White-Bob-Woodward/dp/1501175513), the [opinion article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html) and [Omarosa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKCcMK3_vdM). We cannot verify any of the three ourselves, but weight of numbers is mounting, telling and consistent.
1.8.5.2.1. Con: The combined weight of three things that carry no weight is nothing. There is no credible source willing to lend their name to the rumours, yet plenty of respectable people who have said on the record that they do not recognise the anonymous descriptions.
1.8.5.2.1.1. Con: Bob Woodward is a Pulitzer prize wining journalist, who has published 18 political books. Alll 18 have been national bestsellers and 12 of them have been No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers—more No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers than any contemporary author. He was one of two journalists that did most of the investigation and reporting on the Watergate Scandal. Woodward himself has been a recipient of nearly every major American journalism award. This gives his words weight.
1.8.5.2.1.1.1. Con: The above claim is a great example of the “[appeal to authority](https://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority)” fallacy.
1.8.5.2.1.2. Con: Many of the key people rejecting the story would lose power by publicly accepting it, which is a possible motivation to lie.
1.8.5.2.2. Con: Omarosa appears to have recorded most of her time in the White House, and yet none of her tapes released that far suggest a White House in chaos or unreasonable behaviour by Trump.
1.8.5.3. Con: When comparing the story of Bob Woodward, a twice-Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist \(he covered Watergate and 8 presidencies\) and the story of a politician, a sitting vice president no less, one can expect the stories to be inconsistent. Vice President Pence will deliver whatever statement paints his office and his party in the best light, as will every senior white house staff member. They are not beholden to the truth.
1.8.5.3.1. Con: This would not be the first time Bob Woodward got the wrong end of the stick, as for example in the case of his biography on John Belushi, which was [criticised](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1984/06/04/friends-of-belushi-criticize-wired/7c394846-1b6a-4702-a79a-83534acd1102/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.1224cdc045d3) by the widow and friends of Belushi at the time as "unfair," "humorless" and "depressing", and which a subsequent biographer found [very troubling.](https://amp.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2013/03/bob_woodward_and_gene_sperling_what_woodward_s_john_belushi_book_can_tell.html)
1.8.5.3.1.1. Con: This is less an example of Bob Woodward getting a story “completely wrong” and more an example of two writers having different attitudes about the subject. The writer of the article above even acknowledges that Woodward was generally correct with the facts, but assembled them to the wrong overall story in their mind.
1.8.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: A quote from the article explains that this book is not a great representation of Woodward’s overall body of work: “Wired is an anomaly in the Woodward catalog, the only book he’s ever written about a subject other than Washington.“
1.8.5.4. Pro: UN Ambassador and former Governor Nikki Haley [says that](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/nikki-haley-take-bob-woodwards-book-with-a-grain-of-salt) Woodward's book should be 'taken with a grain of salt', elaborating that “I know that the president has been a great partner to me on foreign security. I meet with him often. I talk with him often. When I have concerns, I bring them to him. He listens, he's respectful, and he engages back.”
1.8.5.5. Pro: Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani [has made the point](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/giuliani-says-diaper-anecdote-woodward-054236136.html) that Woodward's book includes an unflattering anecdote involving him, which Giuliani says is false. More important than the 'he said she said', Woodward never tried to interview Giuliani about it. This leaves Woodward open to the charge that he has not been thorough and relies too much on second hand accounts rather than primary sources.
1.8.5.5.1. Con: An 'unflattering anecdote' may well be something Giuliani wishes to distance himself from.
1.8.5.5.2. Con: Bob Woodward [claims](https://www.comicsands.com/bob-woodward-has-the-receipts-2604988932.html?utm_content=inf_10_3759_2&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=GTAK&tse_id=INF_31e10a80b90f11e8872dc93302272904) to have tapes of all interviews and quotes and says he will release them if anyone publicly asks or claims to have been mis-quoted.
1.8.5.5.2.1. Pro: As an example, [Trump](https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/trump-bob-woodward-credibility-problems) [claims](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-woodward-call) he never spoke to Woodward, in any capacity. While this is true for the content of the book, [Woodward](https://www.newsandguts.com/video/must-listen-bob-woodward-tapes-conversation-donald-trump/) has [released](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/04/transcript-phone-call-between-president-trump-journalist-bob-woodward/) a [tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8aGoEYV2Y) [showing](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/04/politics/bob-woodward-donald-trump-phone-call/index.html) that he [DID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Bbx9I4dtg) in fact speak to Trump just before the book's launch.
1.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.3.7.
1.9. Pro: He has worked to strengthen our military in a time of potential crisis.
1.9.1. Con: Received strong criticism for [banning transgender servicepersons](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-43525549).
1.9.2. Con: The military was already far stronger than necessary. It is just a waste of money.
1.9.3. Con: If you look at the number of wars, military conflicts, the death toll through wars, etc you must admit that we live in comparatively peaceful times, far from a “crisis”. This kind of vocabulary is customary in politics to heighten a sense of urgency or indeed to deliberately mislead in order to further specific political objectives.
1.9.4. Pro: Servicemembers have a more favorable view of Trump than the general public and only [40%](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2017/10/23/military-times-poll-what-you-really-think-about-trump/) have a negative view of the president.
1.9.4.1. Con: That's not saying much, considering how unpopular Trump is with the public. The linked survey also shows that the majority of officers disapprove of Trump, with only 30% supporting him. The only branch of the army where Trump enjoys a favorability over 50% is the Marines, and that is arguably just because the Marines love Mattis, Trump's cabinet pick.
1.9.4.2. Con: Veterans are horrified by his actions towards Sen.John McCain, to the point of the unprecedented step of drafting and sending a letter demanding that he follow protocol.
1.9.4.3. Con: 40% is a substantial amount.
1.9.4.4. Con: Given the increase in defence spending, servicemen are unlikely to be objective.
1.9.4.5. Con: This does not necessarily mean Trump's military policies are sound. Service members' higher rates of support would also be the case if service members were more likely to be Republican in the first place, for example.
1.9.5. Con: Exponentially expanding military reach and expanding an army's operations are historically unbecoming of great empires, such as Rome. [Experts believe the U.S. is heading into a similar direction.](https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG362.html)
1.9.6. Con: Trump's escalation of war in several countries has lead to the unnecessary deaths of thousands of civilians, far more than during the Obama administration.[theintercept.com](https://theintercept.com/2018/02/22/civilian-casualties-soared-in-iraq-and-syria-in-2017-was-trumps-bloodthirsty-rhetoric-to-blame/)
1.9.6.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.
1.9.6.2. Pro: Trump [sold billions](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-weapons-armaments-yemen-civil-war-a8265821.html) of dollars' worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, one of the worst regimes in the world. The Saudis are using these weapons to obliterate Yemen in a conflict that is more a massacre than a war.
1.9.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.9.2.
1.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.11. Con: Trump has undermined the public's [trust in the press](https://news.gallup.com/poll/195542/americans-trust-mass-media-sinks-new-low.aspx). The press provide a general public service through informing the public of relevant, developing, and, to the best of their knowledge factual, foreign and domestic current events. He has insisted that journalists are "[the enemy of the people](https://www.apnews.com/bc8b3670f9284186ac9a2699566b9baf)" and popularized the phrase ["fake news"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtP3yDf4yuo), thus deeply corroding the confidence in an age old American institution.
1.11.1. Pro: Not all news sources are created equally. Some have more professional staff, independent core narratives, and are less dependent on conflict-based, monetary incentives than others. To paint all major media outlets with a broad brush is dangerously misguided.
1.11.1.1. Pro: Media outlets' bias can be categorized under two categories: content and coverage. One could have independent, factual content, yet their coverage could push a narrative to support a particular side. On the other end, a source could push spin, publish half-truth or otherwise unequivocally false, details on stories that would on the surface push either sides' narrative. The goal of any good media organization is to publish unbiased, independent coverage of factual content.
1.11.2. Pro: Trump has undermined the concept of true facts. There's really no necessary explanation as to why this is dangerous because the repercussions are endless and potentially unforeseen.
1.11.2.1. Con: Fake news or yellow journalism unchecked is a legitimate threat to a thriving democracy. Just as a Free Press is a check on Governance, the people must provide a check on gross bias in Journalism.
1.11.3. Con: There are certain news organizations that spin content regarding the president in a biased, unflattering light. In addition to those sources, there are more that report coverage of factual incidents, or policies, of the president and his administration which portray an unflattering depiction of the president. He has a right to call out unfair content, or coverage of him.
1.11.3.1. Con: The president does have a right to call out half-truth content, but to portray the publishers of factual stories, based on the narrative of their coverage, as "fake news" sets a dangerous precedent.
1.11.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.1.
1.11.3.2. Pro: Many mainstream sources pushed the narrative that the president called illegal/undocumented immigrants "animals". This is an unfair depiction of the [context of his discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tmT7-dhOWs), because he was referring to individuals under that subset that are in-and-out of the U.S. jail system, or repeat offenders. Many popular news sources didn't specify the context in their titles, in a day and age when most people skim the titles of the news and share without reading the article.
1.11.3.3. Con: -> See 1.11.1.1.
1.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.1.
1.11.5. Pro: The press are an important check on both federal and local governments, as indicated by the inclusion of The Freedom of the Press in the Bill of Rights. Undermining the public's trust in the veracity and intentions of the press as a whole is an underhanded maneuver of censoring it.
1.11.5.1. Con: Criticism is not the same as censorship.
1.11.6. Con: As long as there has been a Press, there has also been bias or 'yellow journalism' Their Code of Conduct is good, but they often fail to follow it. [A Brief History of Media Bias](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/06/12/a_brief_history_of_media_bias_118781.html). They are more like doctors who ignore the hippocratic oath. Criticism is often warranted. It does not contravene freedom of the press, just puts their work in perspective.
1.12. Con: Trump has used [identity politics](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/opinion/donald-trump-identity-politics.html) to further divide our communities. Our system has to allow policy to contribute to a base line of social liberty and freedom, but with that, in our communities is where the real liberty and freedom takes place by accepting others and by viewing our community as our tribes. By playing identity politics and by picking a definitive side on hundreds of controversial topics , he has created many small groups of US VS. THEM, and in that society we all lose.
1.13. Con: Trump is on questionable legal ground in a number of areas.
1.13.1. Pro: Trump is in violation of the constitution's foreign emoluments clause, and has earned [countless foreign revenue](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/08/china-approves-trump-trademarks-businesses) for his and his family's businesses.
1.13.2. Pro: Trump allegedly [colluded](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/russia-hacking-trump-mueller/565157/) with a [hostile foreign power](http://fortune.com/2018/02/17/how-russians-used-social-media-election/) to [hack US elections](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/26/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-june-2016-meeting-knowledge/index.html). This alone makes him a bad President.
1.13.2.1. Con: Allegations mean nothing without proof.
1.13.2.1.1. Con: The coordination of [Russian backed hackers](https://www.lawfareblog.com/russia-indictment-20-what-make-muellers-hacking-indictment) gaining access to Clinton's emails, and Trump's public call, "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded, mightily by our press." is [a brazen smoking gun considering the two events occurred on the same day.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hladWr2ggAA)
1.13.2.2. Con: Not necessarily. In theory, the good things that he does as president could exceed the bad things he did to become president.
1.13.2.2.1. Con: Few things could conceivably make up for openly committing treason to become President.
1.13.2.3. Pro: A president is expected to uphold the Constitution and the law of the land. If he broke the law to become president, this should disqualify him being considered good \(deontological argument\)
1.13.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.13.2.1.1.
1.13.3. Pro: He has repeatedly [attacked](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/two-easy-wins-now-in-doubt-trump-renews-attack-on-sessions-citing-indictments-of-two-gop-congressmen-ahead-of-midterms/2018/09/03/e6f1356a-afac-11e8-9a6a-565d92a3585d_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.95f86dc5f38d) the DOJ, seeming to prefer defending political allies over allowing a department headed by his own Attorney General to follow its course. Another example of him engaging with the legal process in a questionable way consists of his repeated [questioning](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/404828-giuliani-trumps-legal-team-may-block-mueller-from-releasing-final) of the Special Counsel investigation despite the fact there's no concrete evidence incriminating him personally.
1.13.3.1. Con: The DOJ is part of the Executive Branch, so it is right and proper for the President to ensure it is following the right course, and to criticise it when it fails to live up to his standards.
1.13.3.1.1. Con: It should not be about "His" Standards, but of those that are best for the betterment and running of the Republic of the United States of America.
1.13.3.1.1.1. Con: As the elected President, it should absolutely be about his standards. Anything else would be a direct assault on the Constitution.
1.13.3.1.1.1.1. Con: This is simply a setup for a dictatorship.
1.13.3.1.1.1.2. Con: No, the Constitution is there to provide a foundation and framework, as well as ensure checks and balances for the smooth running of the Republic, not to empower a single individual as a supreme dictator. The Constitution's very purpose along with the Declaration of Independence was to get away from exactly that.
1.13.3.1.2. Con: The DOJ works for the US Government, not the President, and follows the standard of the law [Our Mission Statement:](https://www.justice.gov/about) To enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law; to ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic; to provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.
1.13.3.2. Con: The President pointing out conflicts of interest in the Special Counsel's investigation is perfectly reasonable.
1.13.3.3. Con: Jeff Sessions is a political ally of Trump, and indeed was one of the first senators to [endorse candidate Trump](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/sen-jeff-sessions-endorses-trump-219939). Therefore it does not appear that Trump is criticising Sessions because he is not an ally, but rather because he does not approve of his job performance and wants it to improve.
1.13.3.3.1. Con: His criticisms of Sessions only began when Sessions refused to [shield](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/5/17429068/trump-sessions-tweet-russia-recusal-mueller) and [protect](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/30/donald-trump-expresses-regret-picking-jeff-sessions-attorney/) him from [FBI investigation](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/us-politics/article-trump-pressed-sessions-to-reverse-decision-to-recuse-himself-from/). They [intensified](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/us/politics/trump-sessions-tweet-russia.html) when [Sessions](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/05/30/how-trumps-view-sessions-has-changed-over-time.html) [recused](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/us/politics/trump-interview-sessions-russia.html) [himself](https://www.axios.com/trump-tweets-jeff-sessions-mueller-investigation-recusal-7452ef1b-2ae7-472c-800a-bfd0ff4f1fc6.html) and [refused](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-jeff-sessions-mueller-investigation-russia-attorney-general-us-president-a8504911.html) to [end](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-tweets-russia-investigation-sessions-1.4769769) the [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/23/jeff-sessions-trump-justice-department-corruption-statement) [Election](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/25/trump-renews-criticism-of-sessions-over-mueller-investigation.html) [Tampering](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/11/us/politics/trump-sessions-russia.html) [Investigation](https://www.elitedaily.com/p/donald-trump-asked-jeff-sessions-to-un-recuse-himself-from-the-russia-investigation-report-says-9235544). This would indicate that his [criticisms](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-sessions/trump-renews-criticism-of-sessions-over-mueller-investigation-idUSKCN1LA0GE) are based on his [perception](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/01/politics/donald-trump-jeff-sessions/index.html) that [Sessions](https://newrepublic.com/article/143997/donald-trump-loyal) is [not](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/08/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-hits-trump-criticism-180823213611611.html) [personally](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/24/trump-taunts-attorney-general-jeff-sessions.html) [loyal](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/30/politics/donald-trump-jeff-sessions-attorney-general/index.html) [directly](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-russia-investigation-jeff-sessions-robert-mueller-stop-us-election-meddling-a8472956.html)to [him](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-sessions-hired-him-because-loyalty-supporter-2018-8).
1.13.3.3.1.1. Con: Sessions should have told Trump he was going to recuse himself from anything to do with the Trump campaign. It would not have been unreasonable for Trump to select a different Attorney General who wasn't conflicted.
1.13.3.4. Pro: Wants immunity for himself and his allies while continuing to ask the DOJ to illegally prosecute Democrats: he often incites the chant "Lock her up!" \(Her being Hillary Clinton\).
1.13.3.5. Pro: He pardoned Joe Shapiro for contempt of court, disrespecting the rule of law even as it applies to law and law enforcement.
1.13.3.6. Con: Trump's "attacks" on government agencies serves to bring more transparency into what roles they actually play in a government "by the people".
1.13.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.
1.13.5. Pro: Donald Trump may not be loyal to the United States[irishtimes.com](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/could-donald-trump-really-be-spying-for-vladimir-putin-1.3604145)
1.13.6. Con: Court challenges have tended to favor Trump, with only minor changes to policy \(ie. Travel Ban\)
