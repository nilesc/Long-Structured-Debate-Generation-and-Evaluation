Discussion Title: Should Religious Exemptions to Discrimination Laws Be Abolished?

1. Religious exemptions to discrimination laws should be abolished.
1.1. Pro: The right not to be discriminated against is a basic human right.
1.1.1. Pro: Religious exemptions to discrimination laws enable religious organisations to [discriminate](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/discrimination-at-work/what-doesn-t-count-as-discrimination-at-work/discrimination-at-work-exceptions-relating-to-religion-and-belief/) against LGBTQ+ individuals.
1.1.1.1. Pro: By enacting these exemptions, governments accept and even embrace the [dangerous and harmful notion](https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/02/19/all-we-want-equality/religious-exemptions-and-discrimination-against-lgbt-people) that discrimination against LGBTQ+ people is a legitimate demand of consciously religious people.
1.1.1.2. Pro: [Several mental and physical healthcare providers](https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/02/19/all-we-want-equality/religious-exemptions-and-discrimination-against-lgbt-people) have demanded exemptions that would permit them to turn away LGBTQ+ clients, or decline to provide services they consider objectionable.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: These exemption laws would also allow [pediatricians](https://www.lgbtmap.org/file/talking-about-religious-exemptions-laws.pdf) to refuse to provide medical care to a child of a gay or lesbian couple.
1.1.1.3. Pro: [Certain adoption and foster care providers](https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/02/19/all-we-want-equality/religious-exemptions-and-discrimination-against-lgbt-people), who disapprove of same-sex relationships, have sought exemptions that would permit them to decline service to same-sex couples.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Many of the services provided by religious charities, like adoption services and foster care etc, [are primarily offered for charitable purposes and not directly for religious purposes](https://probonoaustralia.com.au/news/2018/05/religious-freedom-review-reignites-discrimination-exemptions-debate/). Hence it is counter-intuitive to involve religion in activities that are carried out for the public good.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: There have been [examples](https://www.npr.org/2017/02/28/517092031/in-religious-freedom-debate-2-american-values-clash) of adoption and foster care services shutting down because they were forced to cater to same-sex couples. It is then likely that enforcing discrimination laws would force these religious organizations to shut down as they would prefer that over providing services to people their religions condemn. And intuitively, more people will suffer if these organizations are forced to shut.
1.1.1.3.3. Pro: The state should not allow this to occur since LGBTQ+ parents are just as qualified to be parents as straight couples.
1.1.1.3.4. Pro: The state should not allow this to occur since it results in children having to wait even longer to be placed with a loving and qualified family.
1.1.1.4. Pro: It is particularly important to note that in [many states](https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/02/19/all-we-want-equality/religious-exemptions-and-discrimination-against-lgbt-people) where religious exemptions are provided, there is a general lack of any underlying laws prohibiting discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. In such places, many of the laws are not “exemptions” so much as a license to discriminate.
1.1.1.5. Pro: Many LGBTQ+, elderly individuals depend on religious organisations for housing, food and health services. Religious exemption laws would [enable](https://www.lgbtmap.org/file/Older-Adults-Religious-Exemptions.pdf) religious organisations to stop providing these services to LGBTQ+, elderly individuals.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: Religious organisations are not obliged to help anybody. If confronted with having to help people they disagree helping, they might stop their voluntary work altogether.
1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: It should be on the state to provide housing, food and health services for its poorer citizens.
1.1.1.5.1.2. Con: This seems contrary to a lot of religious edicts to help those in need, regardless of creed, colour or name.
1.1.1.5.1.3. Pro: In the United States, a number of Catholic adoption agencies decided to [close](http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/religious-liberty/discrimination-against-catholic-adoption-services.cfm) in order to avoid being forced to comply with anti discrimination legislation.
1.1.1.5.1.4. Pro: Religious organizations have [claimed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4500906?seq=7#metadata_info_tab_contents) that they will shut down if forced by the government to provide service to people their religion has condemned. Hence removing religious exemption would result in a reduction in the number of social service organizations set up which will be detrimental for many people who were otherwise able to avail of these services.
1.1.1.6. Pro: Vulnerable individuals, such as members of the LGBTQ+ community, deserve greater protection of their freedoms than members of religious communities as the former already face greater challenges being accepted in society than the latter.
1.1.1.6.1. Con: Not all religious people are accepted for their faith.
1.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: With the increased popularity of [atheism](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/) and push for the separation of church and state in the Western world, it is not as universally acceptable nowadays to be religious as in the past.
1.1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: [Many nations](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/) are now moving towards secular majorities. France will have a majority secular population soon. So will the Netherlands and New Zealand. The United Kingdom and Australia will soon lose Christian majorities as well. Religion is hence rapidly becoming less important even in countries where faith previously affected everything from rulers to borders to architecture.
1.1.1.6.1.1.2. Pro: [Surveys](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0121454) reveal a seismic generational shift in religious commitment. Twice as many high school seniors, and 3 times as many college students, described their religion as “none” in the 2010s compared to the early 1980s. Even among 8th and 10th graders, who have only been surveyed since the early 1990s, 40% to 50% fewer now affiliate with any religion.
1.1.1.6.1.1.3. Con: An [overwhelming majority of 84 percent](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/27/religion-why-is-faith-growing-and-what-happens-next) of the world's population is still religious and hence the association with a religion is still extremely common.
1.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Many members of religious groups can find themselves persecuted, such as [Muslims in India.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/20/mobs-killing-muslims-india-narendra-modi-bjp)
1.1.1.6.2. Pro: Religious exemptions target the LGBTQ+ community and create an [environment of fear](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/14/marriage-equality-campaign-seeks-abolition-of-religious-rights-to-discriminate). This prevents LGBTQ+ people from being their whole self, knowing that their identity can potentially prevent them from accessing the support services they need.
1.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Many people who are part of the LGBTQ+ community now have to live in fear for their jobs, careers and, welfare – this is a form of [psychological oppression](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/exemptions-for-religious-groups-keep-fears-alive-20130121-2d2f8.html) and one that must not be endorsed by the state.
1.1.1.6.3. Pro: Religious organizations have significant social influence in many regions. In such regions, when these organizations are allowed to openly discriminate against certain groups, they can [add to many problematic regressive social narratives](http://theconversation.com/anti-discrimination-law-exemptions-dont-strike-the-right-balance-between-rights-and-freedoms-61660). The exemptions thus can have a serious effect on equality.
1.1.1.6.3.1. Pro: Giving an exemption to religious discrimination could be seen as the state endorsing that discrimination, which could make regressive social narratives more popular.
1.1.1.6.3.1.1. Con: The state does not show endorsement of the regulations set by exempt organisations because they go against state laws. On the contrary, the state endorses its own laws and only strengthens the separation of state and religion by letting religious organisations follow their own rules.
1.1.1.6.3.1.2. Con: This assumes that people will interpret the state's action in a particular way and then will internalise the message so that they support or engage in more regressive social narratives.
1.1.1.6.3.1.2.1. Con: People's opinions are often influenced by the laws governing their society. Growing up in a place where religious organizations have been permitted to turn away certain groups, individuals will likely consider it valid to discriminate against certain groups on the basis of their personal beliefs.
1.1.1.6.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: These laws will also then reduce the impact of the social struggle against discrimination as a whole.
1.1.1.6.3.2. Con: Progressive thinkers should not strive to silence dissenting voices by banning them with the help of state laws. A more ethical and less alienating way forward is to communicate with religious communities about the dangers of discrimination, so that they can endorse inclusive views and institute change from within.
1.1.1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Many individuals including the politician [Guy Benson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTiADvV_PDs) already combine religion and a minority sexual orientation by genuine choice as opposed to legal enforcement.
1.1.1.6.3.2.2. Con: Many of those who discriminate are irrational, hence the discrimination, and would not stop based on a rational discussion.
1.1.1.6.4. Pro: Religious schools, in their attempt to deny employment to teachers who identify as LGBTQ+, deprive students, who may identify as LGBTQ+, of the guidance that they really need, particularly at a young age.
1.1.1.6.4.1. Con: It is unlikely that many teachers would believe it to be appropriate to discuss their sexuality with their students.
1.1.1.6.4.2. Pro: As a potential result of these exemptions, students educated in religious schools will be unexposed to members of the LGBTQ+ community. Hence, there is a greater likelihood of these students growing up with oppressive opinions. This will adversely impact the strive for equality in society and the impacts of these exemptions are hence not limited to these religious institutions.
1.1.1.6.4.2.1. Con: If striving for equality in society also involves accepting as equal practices and characteristics that are considered morally abhorrent by a religion, equality is no longer in the interest of that religion.
1.1.1.6.4.3. Pro: Allowing religious exemptions has resulted in significant student [suffering](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/july-web-only/california-sb-1146-religious-freedom.html).
1.1.1.6.4.3.1. Con: Students, including LGBTQ+ students, have [a wide range of institutions](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/july-web-only/california-sb-1146-religious-freedom.html) from which to choose from, and a pluralistic system in education should not disfavor an institution that follows a religious code.
1.1.1.6.4.3.1.1. Pro: Exemption laws do [require colleges to fully disclose](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/july-web-only/california-sb-1146-religious-freedom.html) their biases in admissions and orientation materials as well as in faculty and student handbooks. They also have placed these rules at a “prominent” physical location on campus. This is noted to be necessary to ensure that LGBTQ+ students and faculty are made well-aware of the college's policies beforehand. Hence people are likely to not choose these institutions.
1.1.1.6.4.3.2. Pro: Students have been [expelled from school](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/july-web-only/california-sb-1146-religious-freedom.html), allegedly for coming out as gay or transgender, which consequently has caused them to lose time or money invested in that school.
1.1.1.6.4.3.3. Pro: [Religious colleges](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/july-web-only/california-sb-1146-religious-freedom.html) have assigned transgender students to housing based on their biological sex at birth or have denied married-student housing to same-sex couples.
1.1.1.6.4.4. Con: Religious school may prioritise teaching the morales of their religion over providing support for behaviours they consider immoral. Therefore, they don't see it as deprivation but rather as shielding their students from negative influence.
1.1.1.6.5. Con: Preferentially protecting one social group’s rights at the expense of another group sets a dangerous precedent. If the rights of a group that was previously more marginalised continue to be prioritised in legislation, in the long-term, the rights of the formerly dominant groups will be harmed.
1.1.1.7. Pro: These laws could be used to allow public officials to refuse to provide marriage licenses to [same-sex couples](https://www.lgbtmap.org/file/talking-about-religious-exemptions-laws.pdf) in states where they are legally permitted to marry.
1.1.1.8. Con: Many LGBTQ+ individuals can "pass" for an identity that would be acceptable by discriminatory vendors.
1.1.1.8.1. Con: Significant portions of the LGBTQ+, such as many members of the Trans community, do not have the option of "passing".
1.1.1.8.2. Con: Individuals should not be forced to hide their deeply personal identity in public.
1.1.1.8.2.1. Con: "Deeply personal" may be justifiably considered the opposite of "public". Certain individual traits, circumstances and beliefs are useful not to accentuate in public as they could make individuals vulnerable to abuse.
1.1.1.8.3. Pro: Sexual orientation is only one out of many characteristics of an individual and it does not have to be accentuated in public, just like one’s political views, family and financial background, etc.
1.1.1.9. Con: Compelling individuals to contradict their religion publicly for LGBTQ+ individuals can fuel further hatred against the LGBTQ+ community.
1.1.1.9.1. Con: Those who want to persecute the LGBTQ+ community are likely to do so with or without this addition to their deeply warped narrative.
1.1.1.9.2. Con: It is best for LGBTQ+ individuals to avoid studying at anti-LGBTQ+ religious schools or working in religious organisations as a way of avoiding conflict and emotional harm to themselves.
1.1.1.9.3. Pro: Christians, even in countries like the US, have a widespread "[persecution complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_persecution_complex)" that can be used to justify terrible actions against perceived persecutors.
1.1.1.9.4. Pro: The [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/advocacy/interpersonal-violence/hate-crimes.aspx) details that hate crimes can be motivated by offenders feeling that "their livelihood or way of life is threatened".
1.1.1.10. Con: Some people with judgemental parents grew up to hate LGBTQ without religious purposes, but claim it is a religious belief to pretend to not be a bigot.
1.1.1.10.1. Con: If people are anti-something out of an irrational personal belief instead of a religious one, getting rid of religious exemptions will minimise people falsely hiding behind them.
1.1.1.10.1.1. Con: If it isn't from a religious standpoint, removing religious exemptions wouldn't stop people from being bigots on their own.
1.1.1.10.1.1.1. Con: Bigots would have to face negative consequences if they cannot use religion to hide behind.
1.1.1.11. Con: There is an important difference between discrimination and reciprocated segregation. Both religious and LGBTQ+ groups often do not share one another’s visions and encourage only individuals with fitting views to join their organizations.
1.1.1.11.1. Pro: For example, the [UK LGBT Consortium](http://www.lgbtconsortium.org.uk/membership) says that "Membership is open to groups who support our work and share our values and vision for the sector."
1.1.1.12. Con: The [religious exemption laws in the UK](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/discrimination-at-work/what-doesn-t-count-as-discrimination-at-work/discrimination-at-work-exceptions-relating-to-religion-and-belief/) affect only the positions which are closely related to the teachings of the religion. It would be unreasonable to discriminate for the jobs which are not "belief-based" in any way, and this is not seen happening in the UK. Applicants for the role of gardener, cleaner, etc. cannot be lawfully discriminated against based on sex, sexual orientation or religious belief.
1.1.1.13. Con: -> See 1.1.1.6.3.2.
1.1.1.14. Pro: There are [members](https://www.npr.org/2018/04/15/602605271/a-mosque-for-lgbtq-muslims) of the [LGBTQ+ community who are religious](https://medium.com/reaching-out/coming-out-as-an-lgbt-muslim-b2b5704425bd). It is hence very unfair for religious organizations to be able to turn away these people and deprive them of accessing their religious spaces.
1.1.1.15. Pro: This is particularly problematic in [rural areas](https://www.lgbtmap.org/file/talking-about-religious-exemptions-laws.pdf) \(p.4\) because customers have very few alternative options if their local business or healthcare provider decides to discriminate against them.
1.1.1.15.1. Con: This is an argument for governments to provide services, not to compel people to work against their religiously mandated will.
1.1.2. Pro: If freedom of religion is a right then it must include not having a religious belief as well. Hence the right to not have a religious belief should be a protected attribute too and should not be impacted by religious exemptions.
1.1.2.1. Con: Non-believers are not a religious group and should not be treated as such.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Religions are organisations, they involve different forms of practising faith and their members often face discrimination for being members. The same is not true for non-believers.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Despite the majority of non-believers not being organised into organisations, they can still face discrimination for not being members of religious organisations. Such discrimination is no different from discrimination on religious basis, as it affects a group of people based on their beliefs.
1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Secularist, atheist, agnostic, skeptic and other non-believer organisations [are plentiful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_secularist_organizations) in many countries around the world.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: Not being a religious group does not negate the fact that a group - however defined - should not be discriminated against.
1.1.3. Pro: Religious exemptions to discrimination laws must be abolished to protect the lives and health of those being discriminated against.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Religious exemption laws could be used to deny abortions to women, even when an abortion was necessary [to save the life of the mother](https://www.lgbtmap.org/file/talking-about-religious-exemptions-laws.pdf) \(p.5\).
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Performing an abortion can be considered [murder](http://americanrtl.org/what-does-the-bible-say-about-abortion) by some Christian doctors based on the Bible’s teachings; and result in fear of divine punishment. It is unethical to legally oblige people to do what they think amounts to murder.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: Abortion, just like other medical operations, requires careful attention and dedication from the professional performing it. It is not safe for women to undergo abortions performed by doctors who have a [strong aversion](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/forcing-doctors-perform-abortion/) to the practice.
1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: For many women who are unable to travel far or afford private care, the only alternative will be illegal abortions. These often lack professional equipment and medical expertise and could be even more [dangerous for the patient](http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/abortion-safety-estimates/en/).
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: Some insurance companies in the USA use religious exemption laws to allow them to [refuse](https://nwlc.org/resources/put-patient-health-first-oppose-religious-exemption-laws/) to cover abortion.
1.1.3.1.4. Pro: In Italy, abortions are inaccessible for many women, despite being legal, because of the number of doctors who [conscientiously object](https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/claudia-torrisi/abortion-italy-conscientious-objection) for religious reasons.
1.1.3.2. Pro: A Catholic hospital could use religious exemption laws to discriminate against a [rape victim](https://www.lgbtmap.org/file/talking-about-religious-exemptions-laws.pdf) \(p.3\) who wanted to obtain emergency birth control.
1.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.1.3.4. Pro: Religious exemptions to the Americans with Disabilities Act block people with disabilities from access to religious services and community inclusion.
1.1.4. Pro: Religious exemptions to discrimination laws enable religious organisations to [discriminate](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/discrimination-at-work/what-doesn-t-count-as-discrimination-at-work/discrimination-at-work-exceptions-relating-to-religion-and-belief/) against women.
1.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.1.4.3. Con: Women commonly strive to create exclusive environments in their workplaces. Examples are [women-only networking](https://www.wolfestone.co.uk/blog/women-only-networking-empowerment-or-discrimination/) and [all-female co-working spaces](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/career-advice/life-at-work/empowering-women-in-the-workplace-by-excluding-men/article33687354/). If women-only work environments and associations are acceptable, ones that discriminate against them should be as well.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Several arguments used by women to underpin the need for women-only networks and spaces can be equally strong arguments for exclusive belief-based spaces and networks.
1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: For example, both women and religious communities can [argue that](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shenegotiates/2012/05/02/why-women-need-women-only-networks/#622f7ea735ef) they ‘need a place where \[they\] can nurture relationships in a way that feels comfortable, a venue where \[they\] make the rules’.
1.1.4.4. Pro: These exemptions would also allow a health care provider to refuse treatment to an [unmarried pregnant woman.](https://www.lgbtmap.org/file/talking-about-religious-exemptions-laws.pdf)
1.1.5. Con: Religious individuals should have the [rights to practice their faith in ideological spaces](http://www.kevinvallier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Vallier_Religious-Exemptions_LP.pdf) that they believe are inherently sacred. By forcing them to let 'sinners' become a part of these spaces, the state is depriving these people of spaces that they have built specifically to carry out their religious practices in peace.
1.1.5.1. Pro: A huge part of religion is in the [community aspects](https://crcc.usc.edu/how-religion-strengthens-community/); allowing in somebody who is not a part of that community could feel invasive or wrong.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Other groups also protect and celebrate their group identity by excluding individuals whose presence could be considered invasive, wrong or dangerous to the group.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.
1.1.5.2. Con: Religious individuals are allowed "the rights to practice their faith in ideological spaces that they believe are inherently sacred" only as long as they aren't breaking any laws \(i.e. human sacrifice, forced orgies, suicide etc.\). There must be limits to religious freedoms, and they should be subject to the law.
1.1.5.3. Con: The quest for "religious freedom" is not confined to religious spaces but applied to any action that person may take in private or public domain \(e.g. the proverbial baker refusing service to a customer\).
1.1.6. Pro: Religious exemption laws could be used to enable discrimination against children.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Religious exemption laws should be repealed in order to prevent children suffering from illnesses that could have been [prevented](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/132/5/962).
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Fewer children would have died from medical neglect if parents were unable to claim [legal immunity](https://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-city/index.ssf/2010/07/another_followers_of_christ_couple_indicted_in_death_of_a_child.html) on the basis of religious exemptions to child protection laws.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: The Followers of Christ rely on faith and prayer to 'cure' illnesses, they do not use secular medicines. Over [20 children](https://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-city/index.ssf/2010/07/another_followers_of_christ_couple_indicted_in_death_of_a_child.html) from this sect have died because their parents prevented them from visiting a doctor.
1.1.6.1.1.1.1. Con: The state of Oregon has since [repealed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/13/followers-of-christ-idaho-religious-sect-child-mortality-refusing-medical-help) religious exemption laws to prevent deaths like these occurring.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Abolishing religious exemption laws would make it clear that when a child is ill parents are legally required to ensure that their child receives treatment.
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: Religious exemption laws have resulted in some child protection services [falsely believing](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/132/5/962) that they can only intervene in cases of medical neglect if a child suffers serious injury or dies. Abolishing religious exemptions would empower child support agencies to help children sooner.
1.1.7. Con: Unlike most fundamental human rights, like the rights to autonomy or bodily security, the right not to be discriminated against is not essential for a person's basic wellbeing. It is therefore not a fundamental right.
1.1.7.1. Con: Simply because a right is fundamental or less important than other rights does not mean that it is not important.
1.1.7.1.1. Con: A right being less fundamental does mean that it should not come at the expense of a fundamental right, such as freedom of religion.
1.1.7.1.1.1. Con: We could have both freedom from discrimination and freedom from religion if, for a start, religions don't discriminate.
1.1.7.1.1.2. Con: The right to not be discriminated against is a more important right than freedom of religion.
1.1.7.2. Con: People can miss out on opportunities to avail education and healthcare as a result of discrimination. They also generally have to settle for a lower standard of life as many of the facilities provided to 'everyone' are unavailable to them. This can hence impact a person's basic wellbeing.
1.1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.1.7.1.1.2.
1.1.8. Con: Denying religious individuals the right to choose who they associate with is incompatible with notions of individual liberty and freedom, which are also basic human rights. The state should not have the right to force individuals to associate with each other.
1.1.8.1. Con: Anti-discrimination laws do not tell you who to "associate" with. You are still completely free to choose your friends and hate whomever you wish.
1.1.8.2. Con: Not all rights are equal. It is legitimate for the state to prioritize LGBTQ+ rights over the rights of religious people to choose who they associate with.
1.1.8.2.1. Pro: Religious rights, in this particular context, do not have the same impact on people as preventing people from working, which impacts their ability to earn an income. Preventing someone from practising one part of their religion does not.
1.1.8.2.1.1. Con: Preventing someone from being able to follow the teachings of their religion can have a much larger impact as it can lead to social exclusion and a fear of supernatural punishment.
1.1.8.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.
1.2. Pro: Many religions teach that discrimination is wrong.
1.2.1. Pro: If using Christianity as an example, we are taught that Jesus did not discriminate between men and women, job, or religion. Religious discrimination is judgemental and not in keeping with true ‘loving thy neighbour’.
1.2.1.1. Pro: "To speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all people." \([Titus 3:2](https://biblehub.com/titus/3-2.htm)\)
1.2.1.2. Pro: "Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the lord." \([Hebrews 12:14](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-14.htm)\)
1.2.1.3. Con: The modern Western understanding of what amounts to ‘discrimination’ does not necessarily correspond to the teachings of a religious text from a different culturo-historical context. It is therefore a bit of a stretch to claim that the Bible has an opinion on the contemporary discrimination debate.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Discrimination can be [defined as](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/discrimination) ‘the practice of treating one person or group of people less fairly or less well than other people or groups’. Modern lawmakers can posit that refusing a specific job to someone means treating them less fairly/well, but the Bible does not necessitate this inference.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: Certain principles can still be applied in a modern context. Given that millions of people are members of religions which take lessons from centuries old texts, they can have certain modern implications.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: Catholic Priests use segments from the Bible in the present day when teaching morality. For example, forgiveness as a virtue is a key part of the Catholic faith and comes from [Jesus' teachings](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/maria-mayo/forgiveness-in-the-bible_b_911562.html).
1.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: The Torah [prohibits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_restrictions_on_the_consumption_of_pork) the consumption of pork, a practice still adhered to by many Jewish people today.
1.2.1.3.2.3. Pro: A core aspect of the [Islamic belief](http://www.cpsglobal.org/content/relevance-quran-and-sunnah-modern-times) is that the Quran and all its teaching are eternally relevant. Hence Muslims still abide by most of these teachings.
1.2.1.3.3. Con: If this was true many documents from historic times \(e.g. US constitution, Magna Carta, etc.\) would have no bearing on modern times.
1.2.1.4. Con: Despite claiming to not discriminate based on job, Jesus [chased the bankers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleansing_of_the_Temple) \(the money changers\) out of the temple with a whip.
1.2.2. Con: A religion's teaching should not affect the law.
1.2.2.1. Con: Irrespective of whether a religion should or should not be involved in law-making, when it is the case that laws contradict religious teaching \(in this case through allowing discrimination\), religions should reject these laws.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: If religious people ignore the law this would set a bad precedent that could lead to anarchy.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Laws](https://www.thoughtco.com/why-laws-exist-721458) are created to protect everyone's interest. In order for laws to function properly, they need to be followed by all members of a community. Hence if any one faction is allowed to opt out of these laws, it can essentially impact how the society functions as a whole.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Linking religion and law can mean that laws are created to reflect religious doctrine when many people will not follow that religion.
1.2.3. Con: If a religion teaches that discrimination is wrong, its adherents will naturally avoid discriminating. If followers of a religion do discriminate, this indicates that the religion does not prohibit \(or even endorses\) that discrimination.
1.2.4. Con: Many religions have contradictory messages, and religious groups pick and choose which pieces they follow.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Although Christianity preaches love and non-violence, the Bible also says that [adulterers must be put to death](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20%3A10&version=NIV). This is something no longer practiced in Christianity.
1.2.4.2. Pro: The Qu'ran contains contradictory messages.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: In [Surah 19:67](https://carm.org/contradictions-quran), it states that man was created out of nothing. In 15:26, man is created from clay. Since clay is something, we have a contradiction since "nothing" excludes the possibility of "clay." Both cannot be true.
1.2.4.3. Pro: The Bible contains many contradictions.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: The [Bible says](https://infidels.org/library/modern/donald_morgan/contradictions.html) that trees were created for man, but also that man was created before trees.
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: The Bible teaches ethics based in an "[eye for an eye](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+24%3A17-22&version=ESV)" but later contradicts itself with Christ's call for [forgiveness](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A38-40&version=NIV).
1.2.4.3.2.1. Con: This does not represent a contradiction, but a doctrinal progression in Christianity.
1.2.5. Pro: Islam [teaches](http://www.ezsoftech.com/stories/anecdotes1.asp) a message of unity of the human race, without discrimination.
1.2.5.1. Con: Discriminatory taxes on non-Muslims \([Jizya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya#In_the_Qur'an)\) are outlined clearly in the Qur'an.
1.2.5.2. Pro: A few decades after the death of the Prophet, leaders from all spheres of the Muslim community, whether political, scientific or spiritual, were from [different tribes and nations](http://aboutislam.net/shariah/shariah-and-humanity/shariah-and-life/islamic-prescription-racial-discrimination-part-1/) without regard for their color or racial origin.
1.2.5.3. Con: [Islamic teachings](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/islam-and-homosexuality-what-does-the-koran-say-1.5395747) very strongly condemn homosexuality.
1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.3.
1.4. Con: Freedom of religion is a basic human right.
1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.6.
1.4.2. Con: [Mathew 5:41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A41&version=NIV) states "Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two." This verse is often cited by Christians to theologically explain why it is permissible for Christians to obey the laws of the state, even if they do not fully agree with them.
1.4.3. Con: Taking away religious exemptions only takes away the ability to discriminate, which is not a right people or religions should have.
1.4.4. Con: Freedom from the imposition of religion is also a basic human right.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Some people may find it desirable to not encounter religion in any form.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Many people dislike people who come to their front door to talk about Jesus.
1.4.5. Pro: People's right to autonomy grants them the right to act on their deeply held moral and religious beliefs.
1.4.5.1. Con: People's right to autonomy does not allow them to inflict harm on other people. Discrimination inflicts harm on the person who is the subject of the discrimination.
1.4.5.2. Pro: These exemptions are about personal freedom to follow a specific ethos, allowing employees of a religious institution freedom of conscience.
1.4.6. Pro: Given people's historical tendency to [persecute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_persecution) members of other religions, it is important to preserve the right to freedom of religion.
1.4.7. Pro: The will of the majority should not be allowed to infringe on the fundamental rights of minorities.
1.4.7.1. Pro: With [substantial decreases](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/04/half-uk-population-has-no-religion-british-social-attitudes-survey) in the proportion of religious people in the UK, the only way to preserve religious values may be to keep religious exemptions.
1.4.7.2. Con: In the US, [over 70% of the population](http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/) claims to have a religious faith, putting this group into a position of majority.
1.4.7.2.1. Con: In this case, the abolition of religious exemption laws would not necessarily benefit a "majority".
1.4.7.2.1.1. Con: If [this](https://www.kialo.com/should-religious-exemptions-to-discrimination-laws-be-abolished-18593/18593.0=18593.1+18593.378) point is true, and [this](https://www.kialo.com/should-religious-exemptions-to-discrimination-laws-be-abolished-18593/18593.0=18593.1+18593.378-18593.415-18593.548) point, then there are many religious people who admit that discrimination is wrong, even though it won't benefit them.
1.4.8. Con: Simply having a religious faith does not mean that you necessarily support discriminatory practices in religion.
1.4.9. Con: Rights are not absolute and often have exemptions.
1.4.9.1. Pro: The government already recognizes that there are [exceptions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/03/24/religious-exemptions-a-guide-for-the-confused/?utm_term=.e06c054df1a3) to the right to religious freedom. The government may still deny exemptions when necessary to serve a compelling government interest.
1.4.9.2. Pro: Freedom of speech is a right, but it is not absolute as hate speech is [often prohibited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech).
1.4.9.2.1. Con: -> See discussion #10134: Hate speech should be legally protected
1.4.9.3. Con: Just because governments often curb rights does not mean that they are right in doing so.
1.4.9.3.1. Pro: The United States government has been accused of using its power to infringe upon the [constitutional rights](https://mic.com/articles/52889/5-ways-your-constitutional-rights-are-being-violated#.yupuF9DRO) of citizens.
1.4.9.4. Pro: Rights are often curtailed when allowing the absolute right would infringe upon the well-being of others.
1.4.9.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.2.
1.4.9.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.1.
1.4.9.4.3. Pro: There have been many scandals involving religious leaders and child abuse. Religious exemption laws could be used by religious leaders to [prevent them](https://www.lgbtmap.org/file/talking-about-religious-exemptions-laws.pdf) \(p.3\) from testifying against other members of their organisation. It would be wrong for the state to allow religious exemption laws to prevent victims of child abuse obtaining justice.
1.4.9.4.3.1. Con: Not all religious leaders would use religious exemption laws in bad faith to avoid testifying against colleagues. Some would genuinely believe that to do so would be to go against their faith; for example, a Catholic priest would likely not feel they could break the sanctity of the sacrament of confession to testify against another priest. To force them to choose between obeying the law or following their beliefs would be unfair.
1.4.9.4.3.2. Pro: In 2014 the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was accused of taking children out of school and using them as unpaid laborers on pecan farms. During the trial a member of the church persuaded the judge that members of Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Later Day Saints [could not be forced to testify](https://thecrimereport.org/2014/10/14/2014-10-is-there-a-constitutional-right-to-refuse-to-testify/) against fellow church members.
1.5. Con: Many groups within society discriminate in some way. It is only harmful to people when they are discriminated against by all groups which leads to a meaningful lack of resources / access to groups.
1.5.1. Pro: If you are LGBT, there are [groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations_affirming_LGBT), distinct from Churches, which would allow you to profess your faith. These groups offer the benefits which Churches offer.
1.5.2. Con: This argument can vindicate any form of discrimination - as long as there exists at least one group that doesn't discriminate against that person.
1.5.3. Con: It is harmful to be discriminated by a group if you thought you were a part of it.
1.5.4. Pro: If a person is only discriminated against by one religious group, this is at worst a minor inconvenience, since they can just go to a store or restaurant operated by a different religious group.
1.5.5. Con: We should not condone discrimination, even by religion.
1.5.5.1. Pro: People should not suffer for someone else's religion.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: People choose to opt into a religion, which is a valid choice. However, people who are discriminated against often don't opt into a religion, so they never made the choice to have their life affected by a particular religion.
1.5.5.2. Pro: We should not change the law for religions immoral enough to discriminate.
1.5.6. Con: By this logic, laws that ban gay marriage do not discriminate against gay people because gay people can still enter heterosexual marriages.
1.5.6.1. Con: Extrapolating the argument would be to say that homosexuals would not be able to have a same-sex marriage that is recognised by a particular religious group, but could have a same-sex marriage that is recognised by another religious group.
1.6. Pro: In a country where the majority of the public opposes religious exemptions to discrimination laws, the government is obligated to abolish them.
1.6.1. Pro: A nationally representative survey conducted in March 2017 found that [61%](https://nwlc.org/resources/put-patient-health-first-oppose-religious-exemption-laws/) of US voters opposed religious exemption laws. The survey was conducted on behalf of the National Women’s Law Center.
1.6.1.1. Con: The survey focussed exclusively on the case of abortion, which is only a very small part of religious exemptions debate. It does not reveal the general level of support for religious exemption laws as a whole.
1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.4.7.
1.6.3. Pro: It is better for religion to adapt to society than for society to adapt to religion.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Religions can survive and thrive after undergoing modifications that make them more aligned with newly emerging dominant scientific and/or cultural beliefs.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: Many take Christianity to be compatible with evolutionary theory despite the contradictions because the two can be reconciled in theories such as [Intelligent Design](https://intelligentdesign.org/faq/).
1.6.3.2. Con: Adaptation of religion to society needs to be a long and cautious process, an abrupt and highly controversial change of law might not be the best way forward.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.3.2.1.
1.7. Con: These exemptions are a way to prevent future disagreements within the organisation.
1.7.1. Con: Employees ought to be hired for their ability to do their job. There is nothing about being of a different religion, gender, race, etc. that inherently makes you a disruptive employee who will foster disagreements.
1.7.1.1. Con: If an organisation involves having an understanding of a religion, it is likely that only a member of that religion will have that understanding. Therefore, it is legitimate to discriminate in the same way a Computer Science company may only hire people with Computer Science degrees.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: There is a [diverse range of jobs](https://theconversation.com/love-thy-neighbour-religious-groups-should-not-be-exempt-from-discrimination-laws-11634) available in the various faith-based charities, schools, hospitals, and universities. People can perform well at many of these jobs without having any specific religious affiliations and hence religious exemptions should not apply in these cases.
1.7.1.1.2. Pro: This balances out, as while someone cannot get a job within a religion, a religious person may not be able to get a job in an Atheist organisation or researching / teaching evolution.
1.7.1.1.3. Con: If the job requires specific knowledge of a religion then study in that religion, such as a specialized degree in theology, could be required without discrimination against a protected group.
1.7.1.1.4. Con: Requiring a college degree is not discrimination against a protected group.
1.7.1.1.4.1. Con: The high cost of college means that requiring a degree disproportionately discriminates against low income individuals.
1.7.1.1.4.1.1. Con: This is primarily a US problem. Many states have affordable higher education.
1.7.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Norway, Sweden, Finland, France, Slovenia, and Germany have free \(or virtually free\) [higher education](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/080616/6-countries-virtually-free-college-tuition.asp).
1.7.1.1.4.1.2. Con: Community colleges are already accessible to students across the economic spectrum.
1.7.1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Community college offers a low fee alternative to the high tuitions of other colleges. Even at full cost, community college students pay [on average $3,440 annually](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/pay-for-college/college-costs/college-costs-faqs). Combined with public aid this is affordable on any budget.
1.7.1.1.4.1.3. Con: Even in the United States, students from the poorest fourth of the population [pay no net tuition](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/matt-bruenig-left-case-against-free-college) at either two year or four year public institutions, while also receiving an average of $3,080 and $2,320 respectively to offset some of their annual living expenses. Students from the second poorest fourth also receive on average enough funding to [offset tuition completely](https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/net-price-public-two-year-institutions-dependency-status-income-2011-12) at two year institutions and cover many of their additional expenses. Poor students already have access.
1.7.1.1.4.1.4. Pro: Those from poorer backgrounds, because of a lack of knowledge, experience, and information, have a tendency to undervalue tertiary education \([Schleicher, OECD, 2017](http://oecdeducationtoday.blogspot.co.uk/2017/11/is-free-higher-education-fair.html)\). Thus fees could discourage their attendance even if it would be a good investment.
1.7.1.1.4.2. Con: The [race gap](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/04/26/college-completion-rates-vary-race-and-ethnicity-report-finds) that exists within higher education means that it can be discriminatory against minorities.
1.7.1.1.5. Con: There is a significant ethical distinction between discrimination based on an immutable or deeply personal characteristic \(i.e. Religion, Race/Ethnicity, Gender, Sexual Orientation, etc.\) and discrimination based on attainable qualifications.
1.7.1.1.5.1. Pro: There are no laws preventing discrimination based on lack of qualification.
1.7.1.1.5.2. Pro: Immutable or deeply personal \(religion\) characteristics are outside of a person's control.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Often the rules which allow for discrimination within religious organisations are not based on original scripture. For example, there is [evidence](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/31/early-church-found-place-female-bishops-experts-claim/) that women may have been priests in the early Christian Church.
1.7.1.2.1. Con: Just because a belief within an organization is not based on original scripture does not mean that it is a less legitimate belief.
1.7.2. Con: Disagreement within an organization forces it to question its practices and reform for the better.
1.7.2.1. Con: Disagreements within organisations such as the Catholic Church resulted in fracturing into multiple branches more often than reform.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: The [East-West Schism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_Schism) that separated Christianity into two major branches has persisted since the 11th century.
1.7.2.1.2. Pro: The many existing denominations of [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations), [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_schools_and_branches), [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_religious_movements) \(all three - in themselves branches of Abrahamic religions\), as well as [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools_of_Buddhism), [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_denominations) etc., all suggest that fracturing is the norm within religious organisations/communities.
1.7.2.1.3. Con: The fracturing of the Catholic Church also triggered the [Counter-Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Reformation) which reformed the Church for the better.
1.7.2.1.3.1. Pro: The Society of Jesus \(Jesuits\) formed during the Counter-Reformation is responsible for some of the [best colleges and universities](https://www.dummies.com/religion/christianity/catholicism/catholic-churchs-counter-reformation/) in the world.
1.7.2.1.3.2. Pro: [New societies](https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/the-counter-reformation/how-successful-was-the-counter-reformation/) were formed to help the sick and the poor as a result of the Counter-Reformation.
1.7.2.1.3.3. Pro: The Counter-Reformation [fought back](https://www.britannica.com/event/Counter-Reformation) against Church corruption.
1.7.2.1.3.3.1. Pro: The [Council of Trent](https://www.thoughtco.com/counter-reformation-definition-4129718), a major part of the Counter-Reformation, encouraged ethical practices to curb scandalous practices of high level members of the Church.
1.7.2.1.4. Pro: The fracturing of the Catholic Church was a major cause of the Thirty Years' War, one of the [most destructive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War) conflicts in human history.
1.7.2.2. Con: Religious institutions are typically very slow to change, so it is unlikely that the presence of a few dissenters will cause them to reform.
1.7.2.3. Con: When participants in a discussion disagree about what the premises and axioms are it is unlikely that subsequent debates will be productive and result in reform.
1.7.2.3.1. Con: Reforms do occur within religion, as emphasised by the [Second Vatican Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council). These necessarily resulted from people within a religious group having differing premises entering into a discussion. For example, at the time many traditionalist Catholics argued that some of the reforms were [heresy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council#Objections_to_the_council).
1.7.2.3.2. Pro: It is unlikely that religious leaders will accept a female priest if they believe the very fact she is a priest in the first place is violation of the word of God.
1.7.2.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.1.
1.7.2.4. Pro: If certain roles discriminate in favour of the same religions, there is no exposure to alternative viewpoints and lifestyles.
1.7.2.4.1. Pro: This is harmful because when individuals from different backgrounds mix less, it is easier for prejudice and intolerance to take root in society.
1.7.2.5. Con: Reformation is not always positive; questioning effective practices may cause more disharmony and problems than it heals.
1.7.3. Pro: Religious organisations have a right to maintain a safe space for their members. In order to do this it is reasonable for them to exclude individuals who challenge core aspects of their members' faith.
1.7.3.1. Con: The mere existence of another person who disagrees with you \(or is different than you\) in your workplace does not constitute a significant challenge to your faith or identity.
1.7.3.1.1. Pro: Having a female priest who fundamentally agrees with your religion does not challenge your faith.
1.7.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.7.2.3.2.
1.7.3.2. Con: Company rules should prevent discussion of sensitive issues in the workplace without discrimination.
1.7.3.2.1. Con: Religious organisations are quintessentially workplaces in which the discussion of sensitive issues, in this case, religious beliefs, should not be prevented.
1.7.3.2.2. Pro: Protections for workplace safety far outweigh any restrictions on free speech in the workplace.
1.7.3.2.2.1. Pro: Companies do not have a high burden for maintaining an individual's freedom of expression.
1.7.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Companies should still respect freedoms of speech and expression that are outlined in many countries' constitutions.
1.7.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Employees [don’t](https://www.hrexaminer.com/is-there-free-speech-at-work/) have a Constitutional right to free speech or freedom of expression at work. The Constitution’s right to free speech only applies when the government is trying to restrict it.
1.7.3.3. Pro: Having a core aspect of your identity constantly challenged and belittled is very offensive and hurtful. Religious individuals should not have to experience such trauma.
1.7.3.3.1. Con: If an employee constantly challenges or belittles another employee, this is sufficient grounds for firing them. There is no need to use discriminatory practices to avoid hiring them in the first place.
1.7.3.3.2. Con: Even if irreligious people are hired by religious organisations, it will most likely not cause an ideological challenge to people of religion as the majority of employees and the system in place will still favor religion.
1.7.3.3.2.1. Con: Organizations can only ensure with certainty that a majority of employees are religious if they are protected from discrimination laws.
1.7.3.3.3. Con: In an attempt to refuse service to people, religious organizations belittle and invalidate the identities of these people and disrespect them. Religious exemptions and the license to discriminate is a way of forcing people from the LGBTQ+ community or from other religious condemned groups to go through this treatment on a regular basis.
1.7.4. Pro: Constant disagreements within a religious organisation are disruptive and interfere with the ability of the organisation to cater for its members' spiritual needs.
1.7.5. Pro: It would be unreasonable to expect a CEO to hire individuals who profoundly disagree with their vision for the company. Similarly, it would be unreasonable to expect a religious organisation to hire individuals who profoundly disagree with the religion's doctrine.
1.7.5.1. Pro: For example, it would make no sense for an environmentalist website to hire a climate change denying content writer.
1.7.5.2. Pro: Religious organisations such as faith-based schools have been encouraged to write [job descriptions](https://researchonline.nd.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&context=law_article) which clearly delineate between the ‘lay’ aspects of the work and those that require a thorough understanding of the relevant belief system.
1.7.5.3. Pro: The state should not force religous organisations to engage in acts of [compelled speech](https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankmiller/2018/03/14/why-the-supreme-court-should-strike-down-compelled-speech-in-california/#1fc903d6801c). This is what the state would be doing if it forced religious organisations to hire individuals that will preach values that the organisation disagrees with.
1.7.5.3.1. Con: There is no guarantee that someone who is hired will speak in a way which disagrees with the religious organisation. They are not hired due to an identity characteristic over which they have no control, not due to what they may or may not say.
1.7.5.3.2. Pro: The [US Supreme Court](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/supreme-court-abortion-california-fact-act-family-planning-clinics-a8418611.html) ruled that the First Amendment barred states from using the law to require religious organisations to deliver particular messages.
1.7.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.12.
1.7.5.5. Con: Companies often hire people with different visions as it allows companies to change in positive ways and try new ideas. Religions should do the same.
1.7.5.5.1. Con: "Vision" is a highly subjective concept, and companies do not necessarily hire individuals with different visions. They only [report](https://diversity.google/annual-report/) on workforce diversity based on gender, ethnicity, nationality, etc. This says nothing about the employees’ visions as people of different genders and ethnicities can share some core values that are essential for the success of the company.
1.7.5.6. Con: Religious doctrine often changes. For example, within Catholicism the rule concerning eating [meat](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/8512721/Catholics-told-to-abstain-from-eating-meat-on-Fridays..html) on Fridays has changed.
1.7.5.6.1. Con: Specific aspects of religious practice are of lesser significance than foundational tenets such as the belief in the existence of a god. Religions could not change such core foundations without ceasing to be the same thing.
1.8. Con: Disobeying religious laws can lead to intense emotional and psychological harm for followers of some religions.
1.8.1. Con: Anti-discrimination laws serve to protect oppressed classes from the same "intense emotional and psychological harm". Unprotected classes should not be spared this when the result is inflicting the same suffering on a protected class.
1.8.2. Pro: University of Virginia law professor [Douglas Laycock](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/02/religious-freedom-restoration-history) argues that, "Forcing a religious person to violate his understanding of God's will and his religious obligations disrupts his relationship with God, which he considers the most important relationship in his life."
1.8.3. Con: Many people who claim to follow certain religions choose to disobey what is written in their holy text. This never seems to cause 'emotional and psychological harm'.
1.8.4. Pro: If you believe that you will face eternal damnation for taking an action, you will live a life of extreme fear and guilt.
1.8.4.1. Con: Protected classes defined in anti-discrimination law suffer tremendous psychological and physical harm due to oppression. The wellbeing of a would-be oppressor should not outweigh the wellbeing of a protected class.
1.8.4.2. Pro: The fear of eternal damnation can be worse than any other fear as the suffering would be never-ending and inescapable.
1.8.4.2.1. Con: Many people in protected classes experience constant damnation in their mortal life due to inescapable, persistent oppression. This is evidenced by people in protected classes suffering higher rates of mental health issues, suicide, and premature death. Distress caused by not oppressing someone else should not outweigh distress experienced from being oppressed by others.
1.8.4.2.1.1. Pro: [The World Health Organisation](http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/suicide) says: "Suicide rates are also high amongst vulnerable groups who experience discrimination, such as refugees and migrants; indigenous peoples; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex \(LGBTI\) persons; and prisoners."
1.8.4.2.1.2. Pro: Mental Health organisation [Beyond Blue](https://www.beyondblue.org.au/docs/default-source/policy-submissions/stigma-and-discrimination-associated-with-depression-and-anxiety.pdf) notes that "Stigma and discrimination \[are\] associated with depression and anxiety".
1.8.4.3. Pro: Some people might choose to break the law and suffer the consequences in the physical world rather than live in fear of eternal damnation.
1.8.5. Con: Hiring an employee, or otherwise doing business with someone of a different faith is not a significant breach of religious law in any major religion.
1.8.5.1. Con: Shaking hands between members of opposite gender - a common practice in Western business environment - [is strictly prohibited](https://islamqa.info/en/2459) in Islam.
1.8.5.1.1. Con: Rules that are peculiar to a particular religion can be made clear when a person is starting employment. If a person goes on to disrespect the religion and breaks these rules, they can be removed or warned, but the mere existence of these rules should not be enough to preemptively discriminate against these people at the time of recruitment.
1.8.6. Con: Suffering of believers is not an absolute justification for exemptions from laws.
1.8.7. Pro: Within Christianity, Scriptures are believed to be God's teachings of how one should live. Violation of these is viewed as sin, and can result in denial of entry to Heaven.
1.8.7.1. Con: We cannot know if religious teachings are the word of God for certain. We can know for certain that discrimination causes harm.
1.8.7.1.1. Pro: Policy should be made on what is known for certain.
1.8.7.1.1.1. Pro: As religious followers cannot prove their faith is true, we shouldn't legislate based on their beliefs.
1.8.7.1.1.1.1. Con: As we cannot justify the moral assumptions for any legislation any better than religious followers can justify their faith, by this argument we shouldn't be able to legislate altogether.
1.8.7.1.1.1.1.1. Con: People can justify moral assumptions using [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics). The closest a person can come to justifying their faith is by using the assumption that god exists to explain menial events in their life. So two philosophers could look at a morality issue and say "This is good based on this ethics, this is good based on this ethics". But people of different religions who both have their life saved would thank two different Gods, maybe even rather than thanking what actually saved them.
1.8.7.1.1.2. Con: Policies should be designed to maximise expected value; so even uncertain claims should be considered if their truth would be very important.
1.8.8. Con: Religion also tells its followers to obey the governing authorities. [Romans 13:1-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13%3A1-14&version=ESV): "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority?"
1.9. Pro: These exemptions have a negative impact on the job market.
1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.
1.9.2. Pro: Certain groups are particularly vulnerable to discrimination, both historically and contemporaneously.
1.9.2.1. Pro: [Racial minorities](https://hbr.org/2017/10/hiring-discrimination-against-black-americans-hasnt-declined-in-25-years) currently face discrimination in the jobs market, meaning they are more likely to be unemployed and thus dependent on the state. Such policies of religious exemptions to anti-discrimination laws further this problem.
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: Racial minorities are also economically disadvantaged for other reasons - for example, historical [wealth gaps](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianthompson1/2018/02/18/the-racial-wealth-gap-addressing-americas-most-pressing-epidemic/#5683d8237a48) - so they are hit particularly hard by labour market discrimination.
1.9.2.1.2. Con: Racial minorities can also demand exemptions. Their ability to positively discriminate means they are able to provide jobs for groups that are usually not able to get jobs due to negative discrimination.
1.9.2.1.2.1. Con: This argument is predicated on some members of minorities being able to provide such jobs in the first place. This might not be the case, or only to a very limited extent, exactly because of the discrimination these minorities face.
1.9.2.2. Pro: LGBTQ+ [individuals](https://www.totaljobs.com/insidejob/why-its-still-not-mission-accomplished-for-lgbt-workers/) currently face discrimination in the jobs market, meaning they are more likely to be unemployed and thus dependent on the state. Such policies of religious exemptions to anti-discrimination laws further this problem.
1.9.2.3. Con: The policies of religious exemptions have very little to do with the general discrimination in the jobs market.
1.9.2.3.1. Pro: Employers are aware that teamwork works better if the employers share a common work culture. People with other backgrounds tend to have different work cultures. And since now you can be [punished](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/muslim-woman-sweden-farah-alhajeh-refuse-shake-hands-employment-interview-uppsala-a8494821.html) for requiring that your domestic work culture is respected, they will be invited to even less interviews than before.
1.9.2.4. Pro: Such [vulnerable groups](http://tpcjournal.nbcc.org/opportunities-for-action-traditionally-marginalized-populations-and-the-economic-crisis/) are historically oppressed. They are already subjected to levels of oppression and discrimination and have to battle structural barriers on a regular basis in order to survive in society. As a result, by allowing religious exemptions to exist the state is introducing more obstacles for people of these vulnerable groups.
1.9.3. Con: Employers who discriminate against job applicants will often hire suboptimal candidates, whenever the best candidate is from the discriminated-against group. This will cause their businesses to suffer and be driven out of the market in the long term.
1.9.4. Con: If a particular organization/group is so oppressive towards a minority community that they are willing to seek exemptions from anti-discrimination laws, then in all likelihood, they will create a hostile environment for any member of the minority community that they are forced to take in. Hence, even without these exemptions, these oppressed individuals will not be better off.
1.9.5. Pro: The types of characteristics that are protected from discrimination have no bearing on job performance. This means that the best people might not get the jobs they deserve and workplace efficiency will suffer.
1.9.5.1. Pro: In certain jobs or areas, people with commonly discriminated against characteristics might be even better than those without.
1.9.5.1.1. Pro: [Gay men](https://qz.com/work/1147659/gay-men-now-earn-more-than-straight-men-in-the-us-according-to-a-vanderbilt-study/) earn more than their straight counterparts, implying - in meriting a higher comparable salary - that they may be better at the jobs in question.
1.9.5.1.1.1. Con: This is merely another type of discrimination, and shouldn't be lauded as positive thing.
1.9.5.1.2. Pro: Lesbians tend to make more than straight women, in something known by economists as the [lesbian premium](https://qz.com/881303/eight-million-americans-are-affected-by-a-pay-gap-that-no-one-talks-about/); meriting a higher salary implies they may be better at their jobs.
1.9.5.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.9.5.1.1.1.
1.9.5.1.3. Pro: Gay men may make [better entrepreneurs](https://www.inc.com/issie-lapowsky/gay-people-make-better-entrepreneurs.html).
1.9.5.2. Con: Employers have a financial incentive to hire the best person for the job. It is unlikely that their religious beliefs will override strong material incentives.
1.9.5.2.1. Con: Religious beliefs are incredibly personal parts of an individual's identity; it is unlikely that this will not sway a person's judgement significantly.
1.9.5.3. Con: If an individual wants to be employed as a religious leader it is necessary that they subscribe to that organisation's beliefs and values. If they do not, they will not be seen as credible when they preach. Thus, they will not be able to perform their job well.
1.9.5.3.1. Con: It is unlikely that somebody not of that religion would apply for a job as a religious leader.
1.9.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.1.
1.9.6. Con: The rights of religious believers are more important than the job market.
1.9.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.9.6.2. Con: -> See 1.4.9.
1.9.6.3. Pro: Members of certain religions believe that disobeying the rules of their faith will lead to eternity in hell. This is a greater harm for them than minor impacts on the jobs market.
1.9.6.3.1. Con: That some people unfoundedly believe in Hell is not a sufficient reason to discriminate against others who do not.
1.9.6.3.2. Pro: Even without dire consequences, religious people could find it personally or spiritually insulting to have somebody involved in a religiously-orientated job role who doesn't share their religion.
1.10. Pro: Giving any exemptions to religions is discrimination against non-believers.
1.10.1. Pro: The [First Amendment's Establishment Clause](http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/first-amendment-and-religion) prohibits the government from making any law “respecting an establishment of religion". This clause not only forbids the government from establishing an official religion but also prohibits government actions that unduly favor religious establishments over secular laws.
1.10.1.1. Con: In practise, the USA is predominantly Christian, and was forged on Christian values; religion is an inescapable part, rightly or wrongly, of everything American, and so cannot be truly called discriminatory.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: The United States was founded on [secular enlightenment](https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/02/living/america-christian-nation/index.html) values as opposed to Christian values.
1.10.1.1.2. Con: The United States has always been home to large populations of non-Christians and has a responsibility to respect their religious differences and freedom.
1.10.1.1.2.1. Pro: [Non- Christian groups](http://www.religioustolerance.org/usgovbigot1.htm) in the United States are often discriminated against and Christianity is primarily treated as a dominant religion in the country.
1.10.1.2. Con: Simply because something is in the Constitution does not mean that it is a good or bad thing.
1.10.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.10.3. Con: Non-believers do not face the same social discrimination that many religious people do.
1.10.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.1.1.
1.10.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.1.2.
1.10.3.3. Con: Even in today's society, atheists are seen as [more likely to be immoral](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/atheists-immoral-religious-evil-acts-christians-muslims-moral-religion-faith-a7882851.html) and dangerous; it is unreasonable to suggest that the situation for atheists are comparable to that of theists.
1.10.3.4. Con: Atheists have always [been persecuted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_against_atheists).
1.10.3.5. Con: A [study](https://www.atheistberlin.com/study) has shown that Atheist-branded shipments are somewhat more likely to get delayed or go missing.
1.10.4. Pro: There is no reason why religious institutions should have a different set of rules to other institutions \(e.g. corporations\) which exist within society.
1.10.4.1. Con: Religions are inherently different as they concern faith, which companies do not.
1.10.4.1.1. Con: Companies nevertheless will have an ethos, or [core beliefs](http://fortune.com/2015/03/13/company-slogans/), that characterise their corporations; this is not tremendously different to 'faith'.
1.10.5. Pro: In Ireland, a Catholic ["baptism barrier"](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/baptism-barrier-to-catholic-schools-to-go-next-year-1.3488198) to school enrollment leaves many atheist parents feeling under pressure to baptise their children in order to secure a place in their local school.
1.10.5.1. Pro: This can mean that children [miss out](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/faith-school-admissions-selective-conservatives-cap-a8225796.html) on the best standards of education.
1.10.5.2. Pro: This can [unfairly penalise](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/faith-school-admissions-selective-conservatives-cap-a8225796.html) children in the care system, who are 'disadvantaged' in applying to faith schools despite their vulnerable position.
1.10.6. Pro: Religious exemption laws put those following a religious faith system in a position of unbalanced power against those who either do not follow their faith, or choose not to follow a faith at all. As a result, it violates the rights of those the exemption allows discrimination against.
1.10.7. Pro: Religion, in essence, is a private club. Religious freedom ensures that you are free to express your beliefs within the boundaries of your club. Once you step out of those boundaries the rules of the greater society apply. Hence, a person's religious beliefs should influence only their life and should not allow them to impact others in society through exemption laws.
1.10.8. Con: Religious exemptions give all people the same right \(to discriminate on the basis of any religious beliefs they might hold\). Nonbelievers simply do not hold any religious beliefs.
1.10.8.1. Pro: In the same way that a right to free access to menstruation products does not discriminate against men, religious exemption laws do not discriminate against nonbelievers.
1.10.8.2. Con: -> See 1.5.6.
1.10.9. Con: A similar exemption could be given to discrimination on the basis of secular moral beliefs.
1.10.10. Pro: A secular state should treat all its citizens in the same way, and not provide some citizens additional rights or exemptions to obligations just because they choose to adhere to a certain religion.
1.10.10.1. Con: Secular citizens are given the same rights as religious citizens: both are allowed to act on their religious beliefs. Secular citizens simply choose not to have any religious beliefs.
1.10.10.2. Pro: The state allowing religious believers to pick and choose which state laws they follow is problematic because it means the state is choosing to prioritize the rights of religious believers over groups that religious doctrine discriminates against.
1.10.10.3. Pro: Religious exemption laws are overly broad because they enable religious believers to claim exceptions from anything which may contradict their faith. As such, religious exemption laws can result in religious citizens seeking exemptions from a much larger set of laws than was originally anticipated.
1.10.10.3.1. Pro: People with religious exemptions are able to opt out of [a wide range of](https://www.nvic.org/faqs/vaccine-exemptions.aspx) vaccines.
1.10.10.3.1.1. Con: In the case of [mandatory vaccination for smallpox](https://columbialawreview.org/content/why-is-vaccination-different-a-comparative-analysis-of-religious-exemptions/) for children, the US Supreme Court has rejected any challenges. The reason being that the court felt a need to ensure that children's health was protected even when it meant going against people's religious beliefs.
1.10.10.3.1.2. Pro: Allowing individuals to opt out of mandatory vaccines because of their religious beliefs endangers [herd immunity](https://www.vaccinestoday.eu/stories/what-is-herd-immunity/).
1.10.10.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See discussion #5746: Routine childhood vaccination against preventable diseases should be mandatory worldwide.
1.10.10.3.1.3. Con: This is mostly in the United States, many countries have strict laws preventing vaccine opt outs.
1.10.10.3.1.3.1. Pro: [Germany](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-health-measles/german-kindergartens-must-report-parents-for-refusing-vaccine-advice-under-new-law-idUSKBN18M0PW) has strict laws that involve teacher reporting parents who try to opt out.
1.10.10.3.2. Pro: Many Republicans want to expand existing religious exemption laws. [The National Women's Law Center](https://nwlc.org/resources/put-patient-health-first-oppose-religious-exemption-laws/) states that the proposed expansions "could allow a receptionist to refuse to schedule a patient’s abortion, or an ambulance driver to refuse to transport a woman who needs care for a miscarriage."
1.10.10.3.3. Pro: In [six states](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/13/followers-of-christ-idaho-religious-sect-child-mortality-refusing-medical-help), religious exemption laws can be used to provide a faith based shield for parents who refused to obtain life saving treatment for their children.
1.10.11. Pro: Religious organisations in many nations are responsible for the delivery of a significant percentage of vital services such as healthcare and education. Non believers should not face obstacles when trying to access basic services that are essential.
1.10.11.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.5.1.
1.10.11.2. Pro: In the United States, [14.5 percent](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/healthcare/number-catholic-hospitals-us-has-grown-22-since-2001) of all acute care hospitals in the nation are now either owned by or affiliated with the Catholic church.
1.10.11.3. Pro: Catholic hospitals comprise [one quarter](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/catholic_hospitals_represent_26_percent_of_worlds_health_facilities_reports_pontifical_council) of world's healthcare.
1.10.11.4. Con: States can [legislate](https://www.christianconcern.com/sites/default/files/equality-employers%20of%20religion-proof.pdf) \(p.7\) to ensure that any religious organisation which provides services on behalf of the state is required to make their services available to all of the public.
1.10.11.4.1. Pro: For example, in the United Kingdom, Catholic adoption agencies [are required by law](https://orca-mwe.cf.ac.uk/25798/1/Sandberg%202007.pdf) \(p.309\) to consider homosexual parents.
1.10.11.5. Con: The world would be a better place if non-believers would adopt a religion that helps those in need.
1.10.11.5.1. Con: One doesn't need to be religious to have a moral code that favours helping those in need.
1.10.11.5.2. Con: Religion is not a prerequisite for anything, let alone a 'better world'.
1.11. Con: Government should not intervene in the way religious organisations work. Exemptions achieve the necessary separation of state and religion.
1.11.1. Con: Many organizations that utilize religious exemptions are [government funded](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/14/marriage-equality-campaign-seeks-abolition-of-religious-rights-to-discriminate). Considering these organizations are funded by public taxes, they should not have the option to opt out of providing goods and services to vulnerable groups, that are part of the same public.
1.11.1.1. Pro: There are [examples](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/580025f66b8f5b2dabbe4291/t/5a837e94c830259ddc66ad53/1518567068245/Religious+Freedom+Review+Submission+-+HRLC.pdf) of refugees who have experienced discrimination from religious charities because of their sexual orientation and gender identity, but are reluctant to speak out or lodge a complaint because they still rely on these services.
1.11.1.2. Pro: The state has a [responsibility](https://columbialawreview.org/content/why-is-vaccination-different-a-comparative-analysis-of-religious-exemptions/) to intervene when the health and well-being of its people are being compromised. This should include abolishing religious exemptions when they can significantly contribute to many people not being able to access certain health facilities and social services.
1.11.2. Con: State and religion are, to a greater or lesser degree, intertwined; it is naive to assume they can exist separately.
1.11.2.1. Pro: Many countries with an historically dominant religion, such as Ireland and Spain, find it difficult to truly separate church and state.
1.11.2.1.1. Con: This has historically been true elsewhere, but as society develops the distinction between Church and State becomes easier to manage.
1.11.2.1.1.1. Con: The Irish Constitution still acknowledges the ["special position of the Catholic Church" in Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland).
1.11.2.1.1.1.1. Con: There are elements of the Irish Constitution which exist but are not enforced and have no practical basis. For example, the Irish Constitution had a section prohibiting blasphemy \(removed this year\) which had not been [enforced](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/blasphemy-and-ireland-everything-you-need-to-know-1.3666962) since 1855.
1.11.2.1.1.2. Pro: Ireland's [vote](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/rite-reason-why-irish-catholics-voted-to-remove-eighth-1.3511336) in May of 2018 to legalise abortion demonstrates that it has separated church and state.
1.11.2.2. Con: Even if state and religion are inevitably somewhat intertwined, this does not mean we should not strive to keep them as separated as possible.
1.11.3. Pro: These organizations are built for the purposes of protection and promotion of certain religious values. The state hence has a responsibility to give these organizations the autonomy to operate in a manner that helps them preserve the sanctity of their religion.
1.11.4. Con: -> See 1.10.10.3.1.1.
1.11.5. Con: Exemptions are in themselves interventions on behalf of religion that interfere with otherwise clear cut anti-discrimination law.
1.11.6. Pro: Enforcing anti-discrimination laws makes religious organisations unable to comply with the parts of their scripture that endorse discrimination, and thus prevents them from fully exercising their religious faith.
1.11.6.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.
1.11.7. Pro: Enforcing anti-discrimination laws results in more freedom being given to non-discriminatory religions than to discriminatory religions, which means that the government is unjustly favouring some religions over others.
1.11.7.1. Con: Taking away freedom doesn't make anything else more free. If you have two people in gaol, one gets out, the other doesn't go to a worse gaol unless they are the ones who did something wrong.
1.11.8. Con: There is no intrinsic reason why the state and religion should be separate. If a significant percentage of the population hold religious beliefs, the laws themselves should reflect the values of the religion and thus exemptions are not necessary.
1.11.8.1. Con: -> See 1.10.1.
1.11.8.2. Con: The state would have to adopt immoral laws and accept injustices as legal if it copied certain religions.
1.11.8.2.1. Pro: Many people are against gay marriage for religious reasons without having any ethical reason.
1.11.8.3. Con: The separation of church and state is a key measure to prevent sectarian conflict.
1.11.8.3.1. Pro: Religions who are discriminated against by government can take this as a serious assault on their identity, thus motivating violence.
1.11.8.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.9.3.
1.11.8.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.9.4.
1.11.8.3.1.3. Pro: The [KKK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan) was formed in response to a perception of loss of agency of white, southern men in American society.
1.11.8.3.1.4. Con: Violence doesn't make their cause just. We can't back down every single time someone is scared of change.
1.11.8.3.2. Con: Humans lived in civilization without the separation of church and state for thousands of years up until the modern conception of the secular state.
1.11.8.3.2.1. Pro: Modern states are no more or less violent than their [ancestors](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/12/why-human-society-isn-t-more-or-less-violent-past).
1.11.8.4. Con: This caters only for the majority, meaning that the minority views could be overlooked or undermined: even if a substantial number of individuals are, say, atheist, their views are equally as valid as Christians. This is a dangerous precedent to set.
1.11.8.5. Con: Policies better serve everyone when they are acceptable to as many people as possible. Policies being non-religious makes them accessible to people of all faiths.
1.11.8.6. Pro: When a population votes for a left wing government, individuals who are right wing have to accept that even though changes may be enacted which they disagree with. There is no meaningful difference between this scenario and one in which atheists are outvoted by supporters of religion that favor religion having an increased role in the running of the state.
1.12. Pro: Exemptions promote segregation on the basis of religious belief.
1.12.1. Con: Segregation can be beneficial as it can provide a community, given that the only people who engage with a particular service share a faith. It is harder for this to exist when there is not a shared characteristic between users of a service.
1.12.1.1. Con: Such communities are often formed when people self-select into activities particular to that faith, such as attending a church service. Problems arise, however, when secular services, such as schooling and healthcare, are segregated.
1.12.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.5.
1.12.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.4.
1.12.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.12.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.12.2. Con: Sometimes segregation is necessary to preserve culture or values; for smaller or more oppressed groups, it is reasonable to exclude certain parties for the sake of their continuance.
1.12.2.1. Con: This is a justification for discrimination based on being a member of a small or oppressed group, not based on religion.
1.12.2.1.1. Con: As [secularism grows](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/) in the Western world, religious communities are likely to face more and more challenges in their attempts to preserve traditional culture and values. Viewing religions as powerful entities that are in no way at risk is therefore unjustified.
1.12.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.4.
1.12.4. Pro: When business owners use religious exemption laws to refuse to serve particular members of the community it heightens the tension that exists between different groups.
