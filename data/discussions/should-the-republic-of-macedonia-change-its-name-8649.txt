Discussion Title: Should the Republic of Macedonia change its name?

1. [The Republic of Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Macedonia) should change its name.
1.1. Pro: The name is associated with an [existing province of Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_\(Greece\)).
1.1.1. Pro: The modern Greek province of Macedonia was[first named as such during the Greek Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areopagus_of_Eastern_Continental_Greece) and corresponds to a territory that has been known as Macedonia since antiquity. FYROM was not given the name Macedonia until 1944.
1.2. Con: No country should be allowed \(and in this case is even supported by the EU\) to [force](http://www.pappaspost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Athens-Skopje-English.pdf) another country to change its name and Greece is even forcing to change Macedonia's Constitution.
1.3. Con: A nation can have whatever name it wants.
1.3.1. Con: It surely can not as its name has to be accepted by third countries as well.
1.3.2. Pro: The cultural identity crisis that FYROM is going through has led the country's leaders to adopt this kind of name without any kind of cultural affinity. This has led to dozens of misunderstandings between Greece and FYROM. Therefore FYROM's leadership should accept their slavic descendance and adopt a different form of name in their own language.
1.4. Pro: It is in the interests of the Republic to join NATO and the European Union, neither of which is possible without it changing its name.
1.5. Pro: The name "Macedonia" implies connection to the ancient Greek Macedonian kingdoms.
1.5.1. Pro: [Ancient Macedonian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Macedonian_language) is a closely related to Greek dialect
1.5.2. Pro: International [media](http://www.pappaspost.com/nbc-commentators-rewrite-history-opening-ceremony-coverage-claiming-alexander-great-slavic-nation/) [routinely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jed03QfuN8) [confuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Iz4jNS4wC0) FYROM with Ancient Macedonia, despite the two having [no connection](http://macedonia-evidence.org/obama-letter.html) to each other, a confusion that FYROM [deliberately seeks to encourage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquization).
1.5.3. Pro: There are numerous monuments of ancient Macedonian history including those of Alexander the Great
1.6. Pro: Macedonia is the name of a region, not of a national identity.
1.6.1. Pro: People from FYROM have no connection to the Ancient Macedonians, who were a Greek people, just like Athenians or Spartans. This is highlighted by their contribution in the Peloponesian war\(Greek civil war\) and the fact that they took part in the Olympics.
1.6.2. Pro: The region of [Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_\(region\)) spans four countries, with 52% of its land area and 53% of its population being in Greece, while 51% of its population are ethnic Greeks. FYROM comprises only 38% of the land area and 40% of the population of the region and contains none of its important cities and sites \(Thessaloniki, Pella, Virgina etc.\) all of which are in Greece. It is therefore inaccurate to refer to this country as Macedonia.
1.6.3. Pro: The use of Macedonia as a regional term is well established and unlikely to change.
1.6.3.1. Pro: [Macedonia salad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_\(food\)), popular in many countries, is named after the region, not the country or national identity.
1.6.4. Con: People identifying as national Macedonians [exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonians_\(ethnic_group\))
1.6.4.1. Con: There are also millions around the world who self identify as [Macedonians and Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonians_\(Greeks\)).
1.7. Con: National Macedonians consider themselves descendants of the ancient Macedonian kingdom.
1.7.1. Con: Yet, [Macedonian Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_language) is closely related to Slavic group of languages, which is closer to Bulgarian than [Ancient Macedonian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Macedonian_language) which is closely related to modern Greek.
1.7.2. Con: Many Greeks also consider themselves the heirs to Alexander the Great's kingdom and legacy.
1.8. Con: The Republic of Macedonia is the successor state of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia.
1.8.1. Con: The Socialist Republic of Macedonian was practically the successor state of [Vardar Banovina](http://Vardar Banovina) ,the name means province of the river Vardar...
