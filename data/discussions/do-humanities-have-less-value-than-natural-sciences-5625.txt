Discussion Title: Do Humanities have less value than Natural Sciences?

1. Humanities have less value than natural sciences.
1.1. Pro: Natural sciences and technology make us able to develop this world.
1.1.1. Pro: Modern medicine, the use of energy, and most feats of engineering are dependent on scientific discoveries that have been made over the years.
1.1.2. Con: Humanities lies at the core of our developed form of government, social justice and daily societal functioning which has taken us from animalistic tribalism to effective human societies.
1.1.2.1. Pro: It was the works of the Enlightenment philosophers and authors that planted the seeds of the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution), taking France from authoritarian monarchism to diplomatic and liberal pluralism.
1.1.2.2. Con: It is technological progress that lies at the core of our social structures, for technology determines the limits within which social evolution happens.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: For instance, the Reformation didn't happen until the printing press was invented.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Social justice is facilitated by the wealth and specialization brought about by the industrial revolution, following centuries of technological progress.
1.2. Pro: Natural sience is far more clear, where the humanities are subject of perspective and personal considerations.
1.2.1. Pro: In practice, Humanities are not held to a rigorous standard. They present narratives to which any data set could be compatible. This lack of falsifiability in the discipline reduces its value.
1.2.2. Con: This forgets that humanities deal with an infinitely complex variable which cannot be controlled with reason arguments or historical lessons alone - i.e. the human.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Humans' greed, hunger for power, self-preservation and ignorance can lead entire societies to follow paths of destruction regardless of what the most astute theory proposes.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Human relations are more complex than physical observations because the interdependence effects on each other are harder to verify in experiments.
1.2.3. Con: Human endeavours that involve subjective perspectives are not in and of themselves less valuable, they simply have different purposes.
1.3. Con: Humanities give our lives meaning and understanding of who we are.
1.3.1. Con: Humanities are neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition to give meaning to your life. There is no evidence of any correlation between both.
1.4. Con: Due to humanities, the necessary debates around morality and ethics can be held on firm grounds.
1.4.1. Pro: Questions of social and political structures and discourses, and human history, and facts about and equality can be discussed under social sciences.
1.5. Pro: Humanities have been used to build dark ideologies and conduct man-made disasters, resulting in disastrous consequences.
1.5.1. Pro: Humanities such as art and social sciences built the way for social engineering programs and fascist regimes that scholars either supported or were unable to prevent .
1.5.1.1. Pro: Dictators made use of ideas taken from the social sciences to warp societies to their needs and ideologies.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: The Japanese were proactive in social engineering with thousand of students flocking to [Manchuria](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/Japan_s_Total_Empire.html?id=YjW41KFGw04C&redir_esc=y) to build the perfect society, e.g. in terms of urban planning and agrarian organisation. This utterly failed.
1.5.1.2. Pro: It was artists, in particular the desire for radical change of the futurist [Marinetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Tommaso_Marinetti), that paved the way to fascism in Europe starting  in the late 19th century.
1.5.1.3. Con: It was not the social sciences but rather the social and economic situation in Europe, as well as the call for scapegoats, that resulted in fascism.
1.5.2. Pro: The discipline saw the need for action after World War I but failed to prevent World War II.
1.5.3. Con: The study of history cannot be said to be responsible for history itself - that's a circular argument.
1.5.3.1. Con: It is not the study of history but the application of historical lessons to current societies.
1.5.4. Con: Logic of this kind gets us into a dangerous position comparison between man-made disasters according to the discipline that seems to lie at its core.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Whether led by science, as Hirorshima and Nagasaki were, or politics, man-made failures of this kind are too complex to compare on the basis of their apparent 'discipline' alone.
1.5.5. Con: Science and technology have provided the tools for such 'dark ideologies' to be implemented more violently.
1.6. Con: Humanities form the cornerstones of our functioning societies.
1.6.1. Pro: It is humanities that allowed for the transition to democracies by creating a class of citizens that is willing to vote and identifies with the civil body at large.
1.6.2. Pro: Humanities are the basis of how we communicate and human society could not work without this skill-set.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Humanities are crucial to inter-cultural exchange and understanding, for we understand other humans through their language, their history, and their socio-cultural context.
1.6.2.2. Con: Human society worked before humanities emerged. Generally humanities are traced back to [ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities#History_2) but earlier societies too were functioning, such as the [Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt) or [Babylonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia).
1.6.2.2.1. Con: The Story of Sinuhe and the Epic of Gilgamesh indicate that the ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians had highly developed arts and humanities thousands of years before classical Greece was dreamt of.
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.7. Con: Humanities can be used to change society so that natural science results are implemented, such as environmental behaviour.
1.7.1. Pro: Changing behaviour is about persuasion, which is, arguably, one of the most valuable skills available in today's social media and interconnected world. Such a skill is a psychology and social science question.
1.7.2. Pro: In her study of Japanese occupation in Manchuria, Louise Young illustrates in [chapter 6](https://books.google.es/books?id=K6UwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=de&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) how 'civic engineers' helped to design occupation policies based on quantitative social science.
1.8. Pro: Natural sciences and engineering have a greater impact on national economies.
1.8.1. Con: Human experience and its value is not entirely about GDP; there are other "values" people share, and which humanities excel at providing.
1.9. Con: The concept of 'value' itself is subjective and should be contextualized in order for having a debate.
