1. The Obama presidency achieved more good than bad.
1.1. Pro: Obama successfully brought the country out of the worst [recession](https://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/End-of-Great-Recession.pdf) since the great depression.
1.1.1. Con: Economies are lagging behind, Obama inherited the 2007 financial crisis from his predecessors.
1.1.2. Pro: The bottom of the recession was in [June 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession), 17 months after Obama took control, and it didn't set back in during the following 6 years and 7 months that the buck stopped with him.
1.2. Pro: His election was a huge step forward for black Americans
1.2.1. Pro: While there was little material benefit for African Americans, at least Obama proved many ugly stereotypes wrong by providing competent, eloquent, and patient leadership.
1.2.2. Con: As the first black president he was a red rag to the bull of racism.
1.2.2.1. Pro: It's debatable whether Congress would have made an abrupt pivot to obstructionism if he'd been [white](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/us/politics/02cong.html).
1.2.2.2. Pro: It's doubtful that America could have elected a [white supremacist](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/10/the-first-white-president-ta-nehisi-coates/537909/) after anyone but a black president.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: There's a desire for change in every election. Mileage varies but reaction against perceived extremes plays a large part.

1.2.2.2.2.2. Pro: [Trump](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-us-canada-37230916/drug-dealers-criminals-rapists-what-trump-thinks-of-mexicans) publicly cast Mexicans as "drug dealers, criminals and rapists".
1.2.2.2.2.3. Pro: Trump is responsible for starting the '[birther](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/29/16713664/trump-obama-birth-certificate)' conspiracy theory against Obama, a racist precept that questions black people's right to their place in the US.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Birtherism. There are many places where white people are born that aren't the United States of America, but birtherism somehow only started with the first black president.
1.2.3. Pro: Since the start of Affordable Care Act's first open enrolment period at the end of 2013, the uninsured rate among non-elderly African Americans has [declined by more than half](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/14/progress-african-american-community-during-obama-administration).

1.3. Pro: Obama pardoned many non-violent drug offenders, as well as Chealsea Manning.

1.9. Con: He was a consummate performer in front of the camera. He talked the talk, but never walked the walk.
1.9.1. Con: The GOP obstructed him from day one. Part of the reason why he didn't "walk the walk" \(although he absolutely did get some things accomplished\), is that congress blocked him for no other reason than him being a Democrat.
1.9.2. Con: His oratory, sincere and compassionate, gave America a more human face
1.9.3. Pro: There was too much of showbiz about his persona, too much staged empathy with 'popular' causes, but little to show for it either on the domestic or foreign front.
1.9.4. Con: If walking the walk is for instance to mean sending troops to war zones, he did that.
1.10. Con: His foreign policy was hesitant and fearful. Opponents of America knew he could be faced down.
