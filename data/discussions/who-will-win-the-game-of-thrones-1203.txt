Discussion Title: Who Will Win the Game of Thrones?

1. At the end of the Game of Thrones TV series, who will sit on the Iron Throne?
1.1. Gendry
1.1.1. Pro: Gendry has a claim on the throne.
1.1.1.1. Con: Gendry is a bastard, and thus has no claims.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Gendry is left as the only known man in Westeros with Baratheon blood within him.
1.1.1.2. Pro: After Stannis' death, Gendry is the most direct Baratheon in line for the Iron Throne.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: His father was Robert Baratheon.
1.1.2. Pro: Gendry had a lot of charisma. He could even win the support of Arya who seems quite stone-hearted. This shows that he might be able to rally a lot of people behind him.
1.1.3. Con: We have not seen Gendry in like three seasons.
1.1.3.1. Con: Gendry was in the last season! He has returned!
1.2. Brienne of Tarth
1.2.1. Pro: While other characters are compromising their morals, she is the most selfless and loyal person in Westeros which makes her the best candidate to rule.
1.2.1.1. Con: Being a "good" or "bad" character is unrelated to a character's chances to sit on the Iron Throne.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Joffrey sat on the Iron Throne although he had a bad character.
1.2.1.2. Con: Blind loyalty and honesty is ill-suited for the complex politics one needs to play when ruling. Ned Stark was beheaded for being too honest, and [Varys refused to pledge loyalty to Daenerys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DYs4_1IONY); a survival skill which has kept him—a eunuch—alive in the pits of some of the most powerful houses of Westeros.
1.2.2. Pro: Women play an important role in the show and she is arguably the strongest.
1.2.2.1. Con: The women's own strength is of no importance. What matters is the strength of the people who follow their lead.
1.2.2.2. Pro: She can beat several men in combat and won sword fights against Jamie Lannister and the Hound, who are two of the most skilled swordsmen in all of Westeros.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Daenerys, Cersei, Sansa, Arya and Brienne of Tarth have not only greatly influenced the show but also the power to change the game in the upcoming seasons.
1.2.3. Pro: She has a talent in transforming other powerful characters such as Jamie Lannister and Sansa Stark.
1.2.4. Con: She is driven by other motives than sitting on the Iron Throne.
1.2.4.1. Pro: She has no desire for power. She lives to serve.
1.2.5. Con: So far she only has Podrick on her side.
1.3. George RR Martin
1.3.1. Pro: He will pull a "Stan Lee" and put himself in the show at the end and then write himself into the throne as the end.
1.3.1.1. Con: He has been writing these books for decades. It is unlikely he will end the series this way.
1.4. The Martells
1.4.1. Pro: The Martells may want to sit on the Iron Throne for the purpose of overthrowing the Lannisters. They may not want to rule, but just to win.
1.4.2. Con: Most of them are now deceased.
1.4.3. Con: The Martells' motive is vengeance, not power. They do not want to rule the Seven Kingdoms, they just want to harm the Lannisters.
1.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.4.4. Con: The have allied with Dany, and would submit to her being the ruler.
1.4.5. Con: They already have their own kingdom to run.
1.4.5.1. Con: Even though they have their own kingdom, the Martells can also desire more power and status by sitting on the Iron Throne.
1.4.5.2. Con: So did Robert before he was on the Iron Throne.
1.4.6. Con: The Martells only have female leaders.
1.4.6.1. Con: In Westeros, women can rule just as well as men.
1.4.6.1.1. Pro: The rule applies generally, there is no reason to believe it not to be true in Westeros.
1.4.6.1.2. Pro: The most powerful characters in Game of Thrones are women by now.
1.4.6.1.2.1. Con: Pety Baelish, Jon Snow, Varys, Ruler of Iron bank, Archmaester, Tyrion, Faceless man, Night King, Bran. - I think the claim that the most powerful characters in the show are women is an oversimplification.
1.4.6.1.2.2. Con: Also a claim that George RR likes to borrow from history does not necessarily mean he has to stick to it strictly. In fact, there's no empirical evidence people used dragons in past warfare yet RR put them in his novels anyway. Drawing occasionally from history as inspiration and strictly following it is two very separate things.
1.4.6.1.2.3. Pro: Sansa Stark is a woman.
1.4.6.1.2.4. Pro: Cersei Lannister is a woman.
1.4.6.1.2.5. Pro: Margaery Tyrell is a woman.
1.4.6.1.2.5.1. Con: Margaery Tyrell is now dead.
1.4.6.1.2.6. Pro: Ellaria Sand is a woman.
1.4.7. Pro: The Martells have shown that they have the intelligence and cunning to easily overcome their enemies, both mentally and physically. So far it has been implied that they have struck a deal with Daenerys as their ships have been seen in her fleet, but it would not be surprising if they use their cunning and deviousness to try to stab her in the back \(maybe literally\) and take the Iron Throne for themselves.
1.5. Robin Arryn
1.5.1. Con: Robyn is very similar to Joffrey I Baratheon. As king, he would coward when it came to really standing up for his kingdom. Joffrey did not last long as king, and with the way Robyn has been raised to get his way and be spoiled, he would not last long also.
1.5.2. Con: Robin has shown no desire to rule more than he has. He seems to be content leaving the hard work to his advisors - hence how Littlefinger was able to manipulate him. He is happy as long as he is entertained.
1.5.3. Con: He is portrayed as a weakling not fit to rule even his homeland.
1.5.4. Con: Littlefinger is dead so Robbin Arryn matters less since he seems not as capable in playing games of politics and plotting as Littlefinger used to be.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Without Littlefinger's "help", Robbin does not seem like a someone who could claim the Iron Throne and keep it with success. Brynden Tully told about him: "Lord Robert. Six years old, sickly, and prone to weep if you take his dolls away."
1.5.5. Con: Robin Arryn is a pawn of [Littlefinger](https://www.kialo.com/who-will-win-the-game-of-thrones%3F-1203/1203.0=1203.13).
1.5.5.1. Con: Littlefinger is dead.
1.5.5.2. Con: Littlefinger might be content with controlling Robin while he sits on the throne.
1.5.5.2.1. Pro: This may be the only way Littlefinger can legitimise a claim to the throne.
1.5.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.5.5.1.
1.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.2.
1.5.7. Con: He is not a major character in the slightest. He is a small, weak child who is being used by Littlefinger. He has no vision himself, he was raised as a permanent baby by his mother. It seems very unlikely that Robin Arryn would actually rise to any great power compared to the other major characters.
1.5.7.1. Con: He may be powerless but King. He could be installed as a puppet king by Littlefinger
1.5.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.1.
1.5.8. Con: He is inexperienced, too young, needs to get his way and does not have people skills.
1.6. The Greyjoys
1.6.1. Pro: After Balon Greyjoy's death, there will be new ambitions for power in House Greyjoy.
1.6.1.1. Pro: The Greyjoys have a new, aggressive king who claims he can unite the people and wage war.
1.6.2. Pro: The Greyjoys have tried to invade the mainland in the past.
1.6.2.1. Con: That they tried only indicates, they could try again. That they never succeeded conquering the mainland on the other hand, indicates, that they are still not able to do so.
1.6.3. Con: The Greyjoys are too busy fighting among each other, and there is no sign that they would unite early enough to win the Iron Throne.
1.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.
1.6.3.2. Pro: They will never actually control anything more than their Iron Islands, or perhaps some lands that whoever wins gives them.
1.6.4. Pro: The Greyjoys command the largest fleet in Westeros.
1.6.5. Con: Yara and Theon Greyjoy have allied with Daenerys and are supporting her claim to the Iron Throne.
1.6.5.1. Con: They might try to overthrow Daenerys.
1.6.5.2. Con: Their uncle will now be instantly against them and Daenerys.
1.6.5.3. Con: Honestly, Theon is not exactly stable these days. So, his support is not the most encouraging thing in the world.
1.6.6. Pro: The Greyjoys will soon transport Daenerys' army across the narrow sea to Westeros.
1.6.6.1. Con: That does not mean they will rule that means that they will be allied with a possible ruler.
1.6.7. Con: In exchange for Daenerys' support regarding the Salt Throne, Yara agreed that the ironborn stop their raping and pillaging of nearby lands.
1.6.7.1. Con: If they stop raping and pillaging they may in fact be able to garner more support
1.6.8. Con: The Greyjoys have a different mindset, a bit "barbaric" like that of the wildlings. Whilst they might be able to rule their Islands, they do not have the cunning mentality required to rule the Iron Throne and all Seven Kingdoms.
1.6.9. Pro: Euron Greyjoy is the new leader of the Iron Islands and has ordered his men to build 1,000 ships to conquer Westeros.
1.7. Jon Snow
1.7.1. Pro: After dying and resurrecting, Jon Snow is not bound by the Night's Watch oath anymore, and thus can leave the wall.
1.7.1.1. Pro: He already said his watch has ended.
1.7.1.2. Pro: The oath of the Night's Watch begins with "Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death.".
1.7.2. Pro: If Jon Snow is victorious in a defensive battle against the White Walkers, he will be a natural choice for king.
1.7.2.1. Con: Beating White Walkers isn't a legitimate reason to make someone King. Monarchy in GOT and in real life is usually decided through bloodlines or conquering of the throne.
1.7.2.2. Con: There has been plenty of intrigue in Westeros even after great battles. It is often talked about how Robert may have not been king after Aegon was defeated had Ned chosen to contest it.
1.7.3. Pro: Jon Snow \(AeJon Targaryen\) has to forge lightbringer to defeat the lion of the night, to bring victory for the maiden of light. This blade requires a sacrifice of a loved one, which is the bittersweet ending George R.R. Martin is referring to. To end the long night he has to quench the sword in the heart of Dany to forge Lightbringer. This will make him the 'last hero that brings the dawn', as the prophecies from Asshai \(Kinvara and Melissandre\) predicted.
1.7.4. Pro: Jon Snow as Jon Stark will be king.
1.7.4.1. Con: Jon Snow is not a Stark.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: A bastard can be legitimised, as has been offered to Jon Snow by Stannis Baratheon.
1.7.4.1.2. Con: Jon and Sansa Stark treat each other like family.
1.7.4.1.2.1. Pro: Sansa gave Jon a cloak with the Starks's family sigil.
1.7.4.2. Con: Jon Snow will rule as Jon Targaryen.
1.7.4.2.1. Pro: Jon Snow, who everyone believes is a bastard, is in fact the son of Rhaegar Targeryen and Lyanna Stark. This gives him a legitimate claim to the throne.
1.7.4.2.2. Con: It is still not proven that Jon is a Targaryen.
1.7.4.2.2.1. Con: The Tower of Joy scene was pretty convincing.
1.7.4.2.2.2. Con: On the website of family history they officially announced that Jon is a Targaryen.
1.7.4.2.3. Pro: Even the website of the tv-show [listed](http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/got-connections-ned-promise-tower-of-joy-infographic) Jon as a Targaryen.
1.7.4.2.4. Con: He would have to renounce his relation to the Stark family for a family name he has no ties to.
1.7.4.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.7.4.1.2.
1.7.4.2.5. Pro: Considering the Red Wedding and behaviour of the Boltons, not being a Stark might be an advantage.
1.7.4.2.5.1. Con: The Boltons are all dead by the end of the sixth season.
1.7.4.2.6. Con: Jon always believed he was a Stark \(by way of Ned\), it could take too long for him to live with the fact that he is a Targaryen.
1.7.4.3. Pro: Jon Snow is both Stark and Targaryen, therefore he technically has a "birth right." In addition, he is also a good leader and people naturally follow him. He is a good fighter and is loyal to the people following him.
1.7.4.3.1. Con: That birth right is lost/undermined on the basis of him being a bastard.
1.7.4.3.2. Pro: Jon is the son of Rhaegar who was next in line to the throne making him the next in line before his aunt Dany.
1.7.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.
1.7.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.
1.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.2.
1.7.6. Pro: The title of the saga, "A Song of Ice and Fire", foreshadows a final battle between fire \(Targaryens\) and ice \(either Starks or White Walkers\).
1.7.6.1. Con: The "Song of Ice and Fire" could also be the two sides of the magic performed by the children of the forest, i.e. that it is precisely dragon glass that turns humans into White Walkers.
1.7.6.2. Con: The Song of Ice and Fire is about Jon Snow. He is both Targaryen and Stark and is the prince that was promised.
1.7.6.2.1. Pro: Jon is born under a "bleeding star": Dayne's bloody sword Dawn. \(The show shows Ned carrying the sword into the tower and then shows the sword leaning on the foot of the bed\)
1.7.6.3. Pro: The writers have included Daenerys' storyline from the very beginning; at first separate from the rest of Westeros and nearly all other characters. She will eventually join all the other characters but the fact that her plotline has been carried strongly this far suggests that it will continue all the way to the end.
1.7.6.4. Con: It could also mean that Ice and Fire will have to come together somehow to defeat the White Walkers. It would mean a coming together of allies.
1.7.7. Con: There are notable parallels between Jon Snow and Jesus Christ, given his resurrection and passionate following after coming back to life. Should the parallel continue, Jon Snow may end up a martyr, as did Jesus.
1.7.7.1. Con: This has already happened. In the Bible it only happens to Jesus once, and it has happened to Jon once.
1.7.7.2. Con: He already came back to life which means his parallel with Jesus is likely over.
1.7.7.2.1. Pro: We also do not know whether there will be any consequences to being brought back to life. Which may result in him being weakened physically/mentally.
1.7.8. Pro: Jon Snow will become King because a hero always starts from nothing to become someone important/big.
1.7.8.1. Con: George R. R. Martin does not want to go with cliches. So while this would be true in most fantasy-stories, it likely will not happen in Game of Thrones, even though it is a tv show.
1.7.9. Pro: Jon and Daenerys ruling together would be too cliche of a fantasy trope for Martin, who has said he is trying to avoid such things. Due to the lore of Azor and the White Walkers, it is feasible that he would have to sacrifice \(perhaps Sansa or Daenerys\) to fulfill his role. This would be an appropriate blending of tragedy with resolution that would fit GoT. As another commentor stated he has many Jesus parallels, however he forgot that after Jesus was a martyr he was the savior and "prince."
1.7.10. Pro: Jon Snow is destined to ride dragons and defeat the White Walkers because he is paralled with a traditional fabled character. Thus he must win the game of thrones if this is true.
1.7.11. Con: For most of the series he has just been a loyal member of the Night's Watch with no high intentions. He struggled to be liked and was even killed by his brothers of the watch.
1.7.11.1. Con: But he rose to power within the Night's Watch, and also managed to forge an alliance to garner the support of the wildlings.
1.7.11.2. Con: "Being the underdog for most of the series" makes him more likely to end up on top, not less.
1.7.12. Pro: Jon Snow did not come back from the dead for no reason.
1.7.12.1. Con: Sitting on the Iron Throne is not the only good reason. Jon Snow might have been revived because he is the only one who can lead an army against the White Walkers.
1.7.13. Pro: Jon has many allies.
1.7.13.1. Con: Jon is largely dependent on his allies, but poor at ensuring his allies stay loyal. It is likely an ally will turn on him at some point.
1.7.13.2. Pro: Jon Snow united the wildlings, who are now fighting for him.
1.7.13.2.1. Pro: The wildlings think he is some kind of god.
1.7.13.2.2. Con: It is not known how many wildlings were lost during the battle for Winterfell.
1.7.13.3. Pro: Jon Snow has been proclaimed King in the North by Houses Mormont, Manderly, Glover and Cerwyn.
1.7.13.3.1. Con: Also Robb Stark was proclaimed King in the North and he ended being dead.
1.7.13.3.2. Con: Which is also why he may not completely take the throne. In the flow of the show, one who has all, usually loses their title at some point. There is always a transition of roles. In seeing this, it would seem that Jon  may not be the one sitting on the throne in the end.
1.7.13.4. Pro: The strength of the North came close to defeating the Lannisters in the second season under King Rob. If Jon is able to unite the North in such a way as Rob did, all the North would want to fight for him.
1.7.13.5. Pro: Jon Snow has the support of Melisandre, who seems to be a powerful witch.
1.7.13.5.1. Pro: Melisandre thinks Jon Snow is the prince who she saw in her revelations by the God of Light.
1.7.13.5.2. Con: Jon Snow has exiled Melisandre for her role in Shireen Baratheon's death.
1.7.13.5.3. Con: Having the support of the followers of the Lord of Light will not be favorable when conquering lands where "The Seven" are worshipped.
1.7.13.5.4. Con: The last person she supported - Stannis Baratheon - did not do so great.
1.7.13.5.5. Pro: She could bring him back from the dead.
1.7.13.6. Pro: Two of his half-siblings have supernatural powers, that could help Jon Snow overthrow his enemies.
1.7.13.6.1. Pro: Arya Stark can make the appearance as every person she wishes.
1.7.13.6.2. Pro: Bran Stark can control other persons or creatures mind.
1.7.13.6.3. Con: He has not met up with either of them yet and may not before the end of the show.
1.7.13.7. Con: He is not good at balancing his ideals/morals with making alliances and keeping his supporters following him. As in last season when his companions killed him because he sticked to his morals instead of maintaining the support of his followers.
1.7.13.7.1. Pro: The person who assumes the throne will have to do whatever it takes to get there, and Jon Snow will not do whatever it takes.
1.7.14. Con: -> See 1.7.13.7.
1.7.15. Pro: Jon Snow has shown his strength to be greater than he first thought he would ever be, and that is the true sign of someone who will rule one day.
1.7.16. Pro: Jon Snow has shown vast character progression through the seasons. Although he shied away from being Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, he has developed into a strong leader. Perhaps with his death and his crowning as the new King in the North he will not shy away from claiming the Iron Throne as suggested, now that he is technically free from the Night's Watch.
1.7.17. Con: Jon Snow has no interest in sitting on the Iron Throne.
1.7.17.1. Con: Sitting on the Iron Throne may be a way for Jon to meet other aims.
1.7.17.2. Con: Since the Battle of the Bastards, Jon is close to Sansa and Littlefinger who might talk him into conquering the Iron Throne.
1.7.17.2.1. Pro: Littlefinger is dead, but the lessons and greed she has learned from him and from Cersei will live on.
1.7.17.3. Con: Everyone has a thirst for power.
1.7.17.4. Pro: Jon Snow does not care about power and name, he only cares about the unity of the people and the threat beyond the wall.
1.7.17.4.1. Pro: Jon Snow did not even want to become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. So it is even less probable that he wants to become King of Westeros.
1.7.17.4.1.1. Con: Jon Snow initially had shown he was not interested but only because he was not sure of his own potential. The more time passes the more sure of himself he becomes.
1.7.17.4.1.2. Pro: Jon Snow's biggest concern are the White Walkers, not being in power.
1.7.17.4.2. Con: He may come to believe that the best way to achieve these aims is to sit on the Iron Throne. He may take the throne out of duty rather than desire.
1.7.17.5. Con: Jon has never even been approached with this as a possibility. We have no idea how he would react to the opportunity, especially in a post White Walker Westeros.
1.7.17.5.1. Pro: This idea is backed up by the fact that Jon Snow took power at the Night's Watch because it was needed. Jon will do what it takes to make the world \(realm\) great again.
1.7.17.6. Pro: He seems to care more about reuniting his family and Winterfell.
1.7.17.7. Con: Until season 6 he did not have a chance being a bastard, and he never vocalized his wishes to rule.
1.7.17.8. Con: Jon Snow also did not show an interest in taking the North, or leading Castle Black, but now he does. Those most suited to leadership are not ones that seek it.
1.7.17.8.1. Pro: He may not realize it yet but with his sister on his side, he has the confidence to fight for something. His own brothers killed him so he lost all confidence in anybody, but now his sister is back and he has something to protect.
1.7.17.9. Pro: Jon is more interested in keeping the White Walkers out.
1.8. Sansa Stark
1.8.1. Con: Sansa has only got a few diplomatic relations in the South. Her ruling all the Seven Kingdoms is less likely because of that.
1.8.2. Con: The leadership example that was most impactful to Sansa’s development was Cersei. While this could make for a swift rise to power, it also creates a potential for an equally swift fall, especially if she allows her love of her family to take priority over the good of the realm.
1.8.3. Con: None of the remaining Starks want to rule the Seven Kingdoms.
1.8.3.1. Pro: All of Ned Stark's children seem to have high regards for his values, and he himself did not want to even participate in ruling the Seven Kingdoms when he had a chance to. Thus his children may follow his lead in this matter.
1.8.3.1.1. Con: Ned Stark's values led to his death, and would lead his children to the same result as seen with the Red Wedding.
1.8.4. Pro: The Starks are the heroes of the story in a traditional sense.
1.8.4.1. Con: Therefore they will all die.
1.8.4.2. Con: Game of Thrones does not have a traditional plot.
1.8.4.2.1. Pro: From Season 1 to 6 many important characters were killed.
1.8.4.2.2. Pro: Unlikely every other TV-show, the main character died in the end of the first season. Thus Game of Thrones is not like other TV-shows.
1.8.5. Con: Sansa is in no position to rule.
1.8.5.1. Pro: Sansa is a woman.
1.8.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.1.
1.8.5.2. Pro: Sansa has been repeatedly beaten and raped and thus is most probably psychologically unstable.
1.8.5.2.1. Con: Being mentally ill does not directly imply an inability to sit on a throne, see the [list of mentally ill monarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mentally_ill_monarchs).
1.8.5.2.2. Con: Sansa's actions during season 6 of the TV series, shows that her development has been that of one who's learnt to: identify the relevant stakeholders, understand her own position in terms of power and limits, and study the "game" as a whole. This suggests that she is psychologically stable enough to avoid making mistakes that is likely to result in significant backlash.
1.8.5.2.2.1. Pro: This is relevant to the claim of Sansa's mental stabiltiy as we've seen this development take place despite the trauma she's been true, telling us that she's someone who's capable of progressing and surviving at times when others would crack
1.8.5.2.3. Con: Most characters in Game of Thrones who sat on the Iron Throne could be described as mentally unstable.
1.8.5.2.3.1. Pro: Joffrey I Baratheon was mentally unstable but he nevertheless sat on the Iron Throne.
1.8.5.3. Con: Sansa has watched many leaders, including female leaders at work. She is in a position to rule, as she has clearly grown, matured and adapted over the series. Especially while reclaiming Winterfell.
1.8.5.4. Pro: She is too young and naive to be able to rule and is too easliy influenced by people.
1.8.5.5. Pro: Part of her knows the horrors of ruling.
1.8.5.6. Pro: She is still young and female. Though she shows herself as a powerful noble, she must get past her reliance on Littlefinger and must overcome her bratty nature.
1.8.5.6.1. Con: Females can rule just as well as men can.
1.8.5.6.1.1. Con: Being female is not a valid argument, although the young comment is possibly still valid - she has in the past come across as naive. Although in the latest series she does seem to be maturing and learning from her past mistakes. She still has a lot of growing to go before she would be a real contender but it is a possibility.
1.8.5.6.2. Con: She has definitely had character growth though in the last season and has become less bratty by being willing to work with Jon, and while she is young other people who are also possibilities are also young.
1.8.5.6.3. Con: Littlefinger is powerful and has resources of his own. It will be more likely that Sansa will learn how to control Littlefinger and use him for her own benefit than be sucked in by him. We have already seen this happen in the last series, when he tried to undermine her relationship with Jon Snow.
1.8.5.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.1.
1.8.5.7. Con: Sansa's pact with Littlefinger in the battle for Winterfell shows that she is able to overcome personal emotions and be a leader proficient in diplomacy.
1.8.6. Pro: Sansa has developed her own personality during the last seasons and has her own plans now. This indicates she will play a more important role in the next season.
1.8.6.1. Pro: The actress has recently said that next season will see her character grow even more.
1.8.6.2. Con: Sansa just does not have enough determination or ambition. Even though she has developed  from being a timid girl to a more ruthless woman over the past couple of seasons, compared to Dany or Yara she is still not really Queen material.
1.8.6.2.1. Con: A threat against Winterfell might give her the motivation. After what she has been through in the last few series she will defend her home no matter what it takes.
1.8.7. Pro: She let Jon's army die, not only to win the battle, but to cement herself as the leader instead of Jon. She will work from the shadows to attain the throne.
1.8.8. Pro: Sansa is in a good position to command her brother and he will do anything for her, that makes her even more powerful than Jon Snow.
1.8.8.1. Con: Jon might not be commanded that easily by Sansa given his relationship with Daenerys.
1.8.9. Pro: After Jon Snow and Daenerys, Sansa is the next most likely candidate to sit on the throne, given her character's journey over the course of the series. As with Jon and Daenerys, she has risen and fallen and risen again, and she has shown her ability to persevere. If Jon Snow and Daenerys both die, she seems poised to step in and rule, given her Stark lineage and her ability to marshall alliances.
1.8.9.1. Pro: After Jon Snow and Daenerys, Sansa is the show's most regal character. Her sitting on the throne makes sense, whereas other, less regal characters \(Tyrion, Varys\) do not.
1.9. Brandon Stark
1.9.1. Pro: A group of the powerful Children of the Forest have helped Bran to escape from the White Walkers and there might be more of them who could support him.
1.9.2. Pro: Brandon has the ability to control minds. He will end up controlling the dragons.
1.9.3. Con: Bran's disabilities are too serious for him to become king.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Bran cannot walk.
1.9.3.1.1. Con: A king does not have to be able to walk.
1.9.3.1.1.1. Pro: Prince Doran of Dorne was crippled.
1.9.3.2. Con: After being trained by the three-eyed raven and the children of the forest, Bran will have mastered his greensight and warg abilities and possibly have even greater powers.
1.9.3.3. Con: There is nothing stopping him because of his disabilities so far. This could be just a spanner in the works to throw us off. He could become king.
1.9.4. Pro: Bran can time travel.
1.9.4.1. Con: Bran can only watch the events in the past. If he could actively influence them, they would have already happened and we knew about it \(see: Hodor\).
1.9.4.1.1. Con: In Hodor's case Bran DID actively influence the past, creating "Hodor".
1.9.4.1.1.1. Con: The relation between Bran and Hodor is more like a causal loop, in that one can as well argue that Hodor being created caused/made it possible for Bran to create Hodor.
1.9.4.1.2. Con: As Bran gets more powerful, he will be able to influence the past more strongly.
1.9.4.1.2.1. Pro: We have already seen him almost influence the past when he made his father turn around after yelling at him as his father walked up the steps.
1.9.4.2. Pro: Being able to time travel, Bran has already set history's course on the path he desires.
1.9.4.2.1. Con: He did certainly not expect nor want this outcome of his actions. Therefore he might be completely unable to set history's course on the path he desires.
1.9.4.2.2. Pro: The Bran that we see in the show does not know this path yet. But he now \(S6E5\) knows that he can influence history, so will start to change it to fit his needs.
1.9.4.2.2.1. Con: The showrunners will not allow Bran to use his powers to influence the past, otherwise he is basically god and the show is less interesting.
1.9.4.2.2.1.1. Con: The writers can limit his abilities while still allowing for his eventual climb to the throne.
1.9.4.3. Con: He has got a lot to learn until he can successfully do that - although in the last season when they hinted that his dad could hear him calling his name when time travelling is certainly suggesting this.
1.9.5. Con: Bran is currently on the run from the Night's King.
1.9.6. Pro: Bran is part of a bigger plot than anyone else in the story. His connection with the Children makes him most important.
1.9.6.1. Pro: Bran's abilities are just a small part of the bigger picture. He can see the past and influence it, hence Hodor. This gives him the chance to take the throne while everyone else dies trying.
1.9.7. Pro: Bran can become his own army by warging into a dragon, or people he wants to control.
1.9.7.1. Con: Bran can only do this with one creature at a time. This is not likely to be enough to win the throne.
1.9.7.2. Pro: Because Bran could warg into a dragon, he could automatically side with Daenerys Targaryen, who is another prominent prospect for the throne.
1.9.7.2.1. Pro: This would go a long way to helping her tame the dragons long term.
1.9.7.2.2. Con: This is an argument for Dany taking the throne not Bran.
1.9.8. Pro: Bran knows the truth about Jon being a Targaryen, this may play in his favor some how.
1.9.9. Con: Since we have seen time travel is possible and the person in the tree which has given him visions has never moved it can be him, and we saw him die.
1.9.10. Con: Bran will play a huge part, with his super natural powers, however we are yet to learn the consequences of the White Walker king being able to see him when he is back in the past.
1.9.11. Con: -> See 1.9.4.2.2.1.
1.9.12. Pro: Despite his disability, Bran could warg into a more able-bodied person and rule that way.
1.9.12.1. Con: Why would he need to do this? His disability only prevents him physically fighting. He can still command.
1.10. Samwell Tarly
1.10.1. Pro: He acquired a lot of knowledge from reading books which would help him to rule.
1.10.2. Pro: He could be appointed by Jon Snow after he seizes power since Jon himself shows not intention to rule and Sam is his best friend.
1.10.3. Con: Sam does not have the desire to rule. He wants to be a Maester.
1.10.4. Pro: He is neither popular nor unpopular, so he might even survive until the end of the series.
1.10.5. Pro: He now has a valyrian steel sword.
1.10.5.1. Con: A sword alone does not make a good fighter. Samwell is not a good swordsman.
1.10.5.2. Con: Since he essentially stole his sword, it does not come with the usual prestige of owning or having earned it.
1.10.5.2.1. Con: As Samwell put it the sword "belongs to his family", so he did not exactly steal the sword.
1.10.5.3. Con: He stole that sword because he knows that Jon's Valyrian steel sword killed a White Walker so he knows the Nights Watch needs every Valyrian sword they can get.
1.10.6. Con: He has a wildling lover \(Gilly\) and many people do not trust wildlings.
1.10.7. Con: He is still bound by his oath to the Night's Watch.
1.10.7.1. Con: It is [not without precedent](https://www.kialo.com/who-will-win-the-game-of-thrones%3F-1203/1203.0=1203.189+1203.51+1203.52) that a Crow's watch ends with him being still - or rather again - alive
1.10.7.1.1. Con: Melisandre the one who could resurrect him is no longer anywhere close to where Sam is at the moment. Right now he is learning to be a Maester which will likely take a while.
1.10.7.1.2. Con: Samwell Tarly was not resurrected, so he is not freed from his oath to the Night's Watch.
1.10.7.1.3. Pro: Agreed, Jon Snow is an example of that. And death does not have to precede Sam's watch ending - he could simply break his oath to the watch after all.
1.10.7.2. Pro: Samwell Tarly mentioned that he wants to continue his given task and become the new Maester in Castle Black.
1.10.8. Con: Sam could never rule the Seven Kingdoms.
1.10.8.1. Pro: He is weak, physically.
1.10.8.1.1. Con: There have been people sitting on the Iron Throne that were physically weak, too.
1.10.8.1.1.1. Pro: Tommen Baratheon was physically weak but sat on the Iron Throne.
1.10.8.1.1.2. Pro: At the end of season 6 Cersei is crowned queen although she herself is physically weak.
1.10.8.2. Pro: He is highly introverted with little or no desire for power.
1.10.8.3. Pro: He is a scholar and self-admitted coward with no intentions of ruling.
1.10.8.3.1. Pro: Although he may have killed a White Walker, that was out of necessity; violence is not in his nature at all, he is a bookworm, and a conqueror of the Iron Throne will without a doubt need to use violence. Sam just does not have that in him.
1.10.8.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.7.2.
1.10.8.3.3. Pro: He does not have the desire to lead in this way.
1.10.8.3.4. Con: He is a self-admitted coward, but as we have seen on GoT, that could definitely change, especially if someone he loves is in danger.
1.10.8.4. Pro: Sam does not have enough backing or popularity to be king.
1.10.8.4.1. Pro: He does not even have the support of his own father.
1.10.8.4.2. Pro: He is one man without the backing of a major army.
1.10.9. Con: As soon as Sam finishes his education as a Maester, he can not exercise secular power anymore.
1.11. Nobody
1.11.1. Pro: Daenerys is interested in "breaking the wheel" so that this system \(feudal\) does not exist anymore, and hence it is a high chance that she will actually break the Iron Throne.
1.11.2. Pro: While in the House of the Undying in season 2, Daenerys has a vision of the Iron Throne being empty and covered by snow. The King's hall is deserted with no ruler and no subjects to rule over. This might be a prophecy.
1.11.2.1. Pro: In season 4, Bran Stark has a similar vision, watching the same abandoned room, the empty Iron Throne dusted in snow and left in disrepair.
1.11.2.2. Pro: This might indicate that the White Walkers should reach King's Landing and destroy it just about the same time as Dany's dragons burn it down.
1.11.3. Con: Whether it's a character we know of or someone else; someone will always rise to power no matter how brief. The only way no one would win is if every living person were to die.
1.11.4. Pro: George likes to kill off characters and it wouldn't be surprised if he killed off the entirety of Westeros.
1.11.5. Pro: George RR Martin might die before the books finish/the show ends.
1.11.5.1. Con: The question is about who will sit on the throne by the end of the TV series, which will end regardless of George RR Martin's longevity.
1.11.6. Pro: Many magical and holy powers are at play in Westeros and beyond. By the end of the series, it is likely that Westeros will be destroyed. The power of time travel is at play now. Certain characters are potentially gods reborn. The potential for total anhilation by White Walkers, dragons and other forces exists. The Iron throne will be insignificant in the end.
1.11.6.1. Con: There is nothing that suggests the ability to time travel will hold any significant influence as the instances in which we've seen time travel in GOT clearly shows us that any act influencing events in time are acts that were already pre-determined. Example of this is how the influence on Hodor only gave an explanation for why he repeats the word Hodor and not something that fundamentally altered the timeline. By these rules, Bran's influence on time is confined to a set fate.
1.11.6.1.1. Con: Bran's time travel may impact events of the "set fate" that havn't occurred in the present yet. The impact Bran had or might have is presently unknown and could have dramatic effects on Westeros's past present and future.
1.11.6.2. Con: Dragons almost going extinct before the beginning of the series does mean your assesment of them as so utterly devastatingly powerful seems to be exaggerated. We do not know the white walkers intentions but we do know that humans were able to reach an agreement with them in the past that saw them retreat to the north. This tells us that it is unlikely that the White Walkers are interested in annihilating the humans.
1.11.6.2.1. Con: The White Wakers almost entirely eliminated the Wildlings in season 5, along with everyone else they have come into contact with in previous seasons. The recent behavior of the current group of White Walkers would support the theory that they are indeed trying to eliminate all humans in Westeros presently. Dragon wise, there is the potential for Daenerys's dragons to do serious damage to Westeros, along with the theory that there is an ice dragon \(or another magical force\) trapped in the wall.
1.11.7. Pro: The point that Martin is making is that the Westeros style of government \(government by strongman and patronage\) is just awful. Having anyone "win" would undermine the entire point.
1.11.8. Pro: There is a [conclusive theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/23p48r/the_true_nature_and_purpose_of_the_others_and_the/) that Jon Snow may become King on the Wall after he reforges the peace treaty with the Other Ones. Thus, the center of power in Westeros may shift north and the Iron Throne may become irrelevant.
1.11.8.1. Con: Even if the significance of the Iron Throne is lost, there will still be someone who controls King's Landing.
1.11.8.1.1. Pro: There are [half a million people in King's Landing](https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/game-of-thrones-westeros-mapped/) and, being a major port in the south, it is also Westeros's economic hub.
1.11.8.1.1.1. Con: Per [the same link](https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/game-of-thrones-westeros-mapped/), there are 60 million people in Westeros overall, which means that 0.83% live in King's Landing. This is not enough glue to hold together a cobbled union of vastly different cultures; the result may instead mirror the decline of the Ottoman Empire.
1.11.9. Pro: George R. R. Martin said, that GoT will end on a "bittersweet" note. Thus, there may be no clear winner.
1.11.9.1. Con: "Bittersweet" does not mean complete annihilation as that would be only "bitter". There must also be a "sweet" taste.
1.11.10. Con: There must be a leader in the kingdom, so someone must "win".
1.11.10.1. Con: Leaders do not always sit on thrones. It could be that the game ends by the throne being destroyed.
1.11.10.2. Pro: When the throne is vacant, there will always be someone power hungry enough to claim it.
1.11.10.3. Con: It is possible that society collapses and there is no ruler at the end of the series.
1.11.10.4. Con: The "kingdom" has broken apart so much over the course of the series that it is possible they do not ban back together and each 'section' of Westeros governs itself \(i.e. the North, Iron Islands, and so on.\)
1.11.10.5. Con: Monarchical rule is not the only way that a world can be governed.
1.11.10.5.1. Pro: The show could end in a state of anarchy.
1.11.11. Con: TV shows often have satisfying endings so that fans are not disappointed. No one winning would be a let down.
1.11.11.1. Con: -> See 1.8.4.2.
1.11.11.2. Con: Game of Thrones is not a show that is concerned with altering the storyline in order to leave fans satisfied. Fans will debate the show vigorously for years regardless of how it ends.
1.11.12. Pro: Daenerys and Jon Snow will free the kingdom from monarchical rule, as neither seems power-obsessed.
1.11.12.1. Pro: Working with Theon Greyjoy and his sister Yara gives a glimpse of this.
1.11.12.2. Pro: After the Seven Kingdoms are united \(either by one or both of them\), in order for peace to reign, they will destroy the Iron Throne, removing the eternal struggle for power within the Seven Kingdoms and allowing them to self-govern.
1.11.12.3. Con: Daenerys is absolutely power-obsessed. She has turned into a conqueror and nearly had to be forced not to attack King's Landing. The reason she freed the slaves in Astapor was motivated by gaining a claim to validity.
1.11.13. Pro: It is possible based on the history that has shown to have endings that do not cater towards the happy ever after view that it will end in the non-traditional way with no clear winner at all.
1.11.14. Pro: The show has a history of ending seasons on cliffhangers. There is the possibility that the entire show could end on a cliffhanger, possibly leaving the fans waiting multiple years for another season a long time in the future.
1.12. Tyrion Lannister
1.12.1. Pro: Tyrion is most capable to rule.
1.12.1.1. Pro: He certainly has the brains to do so.
1.12.1.2. Pro: He understands the common man better than other characters.
1.12.1.2.1. Con: Tyrion would have difficulty securing the loyalty of common folk and nobles alike due to his deformity. He is also infamous at the moment in Westeros.
1.12.1.2.1.1. Pro: People would not give Tyrion a second chance after blame was previously laid at his feet.
1.12.1.2.1.2. Pro: As a small person, it would be unlikely for him to win due to how he is seen, BUT, he has helped those in many kingdoms. He may have more allies than is shown. At the least, he would be an adviser or knighted due to the nobility he has shown throughout the seasons.
1.12.1.2.1.3. Pro: Among the smallfolk Tyrion is widely considered a comedic villain. He would find it extremely difficult to gain any support from the people.
1.12.1.3. Pro: Tyrion has already proven to be a capable ruler \(as the king's hand\).
1.12.1.3.1. Con: Tyrion is not taken seriously by most of Westeros' nobility.
1.12.1.4. Con: Tyrion has never ruled anything on his own. He was only hand of the king or advisor.
1.12.1.4.1. Con: After Daenerys escaped Meereen, Daario advises Tyrion to stay and rule on Daenerys's behalf, knowing of his political skills from his time as Hand of the King.
1.12.1.4.2. Con: As hand of the king or advisor he did most of the work while the king or queen was mostly absent.
1.12.1.4.2.1. Pro: The pro to what you are saying is because Tyrion has done a lot of the behind the scenes negotiating and observing how ruling works, he could potential make for a very good king, IF given the chance \(his stature may be more of an issue.\)
1.12.1.5. Con: He is more of an adviser, not a ruler. But he will be on the winning side
1.12.1.5.1. Pro: Tyrion's power only comes from whoever is in charge and he still faces resistance. Having anyone join him to take power over the person they fear more is almost impossible.
1.12.1.5.2. Pro: He has also stated that he has no desire to rule, that he likes being an advisor to rulers.
1.12.1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.12.1.4.1.
1.12.1.5.4. Con: He will not necessarily be on the winning side. After learning he has a niece or nephew on the way, he has regained hope for House Lannister. Additionally, he is disappointed that Daenerys is not heeding his advice. He will change allegiances to House Lannister without regard to the winner.
1.12.1.5.5. Pro: He is the type of guy whose success is tied to the shadow of another.
1.12.1.5.6. Pro: It is too much responsibility and not something that he would seek personally. But he will be backing the winning player at the end.
1.12.1.6. Pro: The Lannisters have a virtually infinite amount of resources.
1.12.1.6.1. Con: Tyrion at this point in time has no access to these resources so while this may be good support for Cersei and Jaime it does not hold true for Tyrion.
1.12.1.6.2. Con: The last Lannister gold mine ran dry over three years ago. \(as Tywin admitted to Cersei in S04E05\)
1.12.1.6.3. Pro: Their city Casterly Rock sits atop the most productive gold mine in the Westerlands.
1.12.1.6.4. Pro: Whether or not it is true, the perception that they have infinite resources - and that they "always pay their debts"- means that they can essentially operate as though their resources are indeed infinite.
1.12.2. Con: -> See 1.12.1.4.
1.12.3. Con: -> See 1.12.1.5.
1.12.4. Con: -> See 1.12.1.2.1.
1.12.5. Pro: Tyrion has stated himself that he does not wish to rule, he prefers being close to those who rule and operating behind the curtains. Due to him always being close to a powerful leader, there might be a situation arising where he would have to reluctantly rule.
1.12.6. Pro: Tyrion could be the point at which the Lannisters and the Targeryen lines of power join.
1.12.6.1. Pro: If Daenerys dies, the power over her army and her dragons would fall to Tyrion.
1.12.6.2. Pro: If Cersei and Jamie both die, Tyrion is the last Lannister standing.
1.12.7. Pro: If Tyrion Lannister is actually a Targaryen, he could rule alongside Dany.
1.12.7.1. Pro: Tyrion might be a Targaryen.
1.12.7.1.1. Pro: According to Barristan Selmy, the Mad King lusted after Tyrion's mother.
1.12.7.1.2. Pro: In the books, Tyrion is described as having the same silvery-blonde hair as the Targaryens.
1.12.7.1.3. Pro: Tyrion dreams about dragons.
1.12.7.1.4. Pro: \(in the book\) Tyrion has one violet eye.
1.12.7.1.5. Pro: Tyrion can handle Dany's dragons.
1.12.7.1.5.1. Con: Maybe the dragons were just surprised by their first encounter with a dwarf, similar to cats first playing around with little animals before deciding to eat them.
1.12.7.1.6. Pro: Tyrion could be the son of the mad king Aerys Targaryen and Joanna Lannister.
1.12.7.1.6.1. Pro: In his dying moments Tywin Lannister tells Tyrion "you are no son of mine"
1.12.7.1.6.2. Pro: Tywin Lannister hated Aerys Targaryen \(so much so that he joined the rebellion against him\)
1.12.7.1.7. Con: Everyone in the show so far has asserted that Tyrion is a Lannister.
1.12.7.2. Con: There are no indications that Tyrion is a Targaryen.
1.12.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.12.7.1.
1.12.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.12.1.3.
1.12.8. Con: Tyrion has no army of his own.
1.12.8.1. Con: He does, however, have a relationship with Daenerys \(and her dragons\), and that could turn into an army that would follow Tyrion.
1.12.8.2. Con: He is still a Lannister and could probably team up with his brother who has access to the Lannister army.
1.12.9. Con: Tyrion's politics already screwed Meereen.
1.12.10. Con: Some might question his allegiances since he has switched sides and gone against his Lannister family,
1.12.10.1. Con: Switching allegiance could be the route to power.
1.12.11. Pro: Tyrion seems like perhaps the most unlikely to rule, given his diminutive stature and having been disgraced multiple times. However, George R.R. Martin seems fine with leading the story down a counterintuitive path. He would perhaps be the most surprising ruler to emerge in the end, but his assuming the throne would also make some sense.
1.12.11.1. Pro: Tyrion seems like the most likely character to assume control of Daenerys's dragons, given his previous interaction with them. This is especially true if he is, in fact, a Targaryen.
1.12.12. Pro: It is possible Tyrion is the third head of the dragon, given the perceived theory of the relationship between his mother and the mad king. He is the most experienced in politics and has the most knowledge of the kingdoms.
1.12.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.7.1.1.
1.13. Sandor Clegane \("The Hound"\)
1.13.1. Pro: He must play an important role later since George R. R. Martin has kept him alive after he was seriously wounded and ready to die.
1.13.1.1. Con: He has joined the Brotherhood to fight the White Walkers in the North but not to conquer the Iron Throne.
1.13.2. Pro: His character was never bad in itself, just an opportunist. After his desertion from the Lannister forces he started do more good. Look at the evolution of his relationship with Arya.
1.13.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.13.3. Pro: He is ruthless enough to kill everyone to stand in his way.
1.13.3.1. Con: The Hound could not possibly kill whole armies \(which would be necessary to claim the throne\).
1.13.4. Con: He is fueled by hate, not by ambition or hunger for power.
1.13.4.1. Pro: The Hound has no drive for power, no cunning, no deviousness. He is a fairly simple man who relies on brute strength, although he does have more intelligence than his brother.
1.13.5. Con: He has no claim.
1.13.5.1. Con: Robert Baratheon had no claim either before he took the throne.
1.13.5.1.1. Con: Robert was head of house Baratheon. That is much closer to having a claim than The Hound.
1.13.6. Con: He has no supporters.
1.13.6.1. Con: He now is part of the brotherhood.
1.13.7. Con: He is not smart enough to rule nor to conquer the throne.
1.13.8. Con: He will not fight for the throne himself, but will reunite with Arya and back her and whoever she is fighting for.
1.14. Arya Stark
1.14.1. Con: She has very few allies.
1.14.2. Pro: She will win with Sansa's face!
1.14.3. Pro: She doesn't need any allies since she can be anybody she wants.
1.14.4. Pro: Arya is a capable fighter because of her training by the Faceless Men.
1.14.4.1. Con: She did not leave the Faceless Men on good terms. They may be coming for her.
1.14.4.2. Pro: Arya single-handedly killed the remaining members of House Frey after killing Walder Frey using techniques she learned from the Faceless Men.
1.14.4.3. Pro: Arya killed the Waif.
1.14.4.4. Pro: She has successfully killed \(at least\) Walder Frey using the skills she was taught by the Faceless Men.
1.14.5. Con: Arya's driving force is revenge, not the wish to rule Westeros.
1.14.5.1. Con: The ultimate end to avenging her family would be to sit on the throne.
1.14.5.2. Pro: Even when she was young, she always [wanted to be a knight](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/7a6e0179-1443-48ff-9684-1cf4666d37ea) instead of what was expected of her \(i.e. to be a lady\). She repeats this throughout the series. And when asked directly whether it bothers her that Sansa is Lady of Winterfell, she says: "I was never going to be as good a lady as you, [so I had to be something else](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/27058265-91ce-4b84-9da5-9d5031b12293)". She does not even want to rule Winterfell in the slightest, let alone Westeros.
1.14.5.3. Pro: Arya maintains a list of people she wants to kill.
1.14.5.4. Pro: Arya never mentioned a desire to rule.
1.14.6. Pro: Arya is going to end her quest for revenge eventually and then she will fight on the side of Jon Snow.
1.14.6.1. Con: She has her older sister and Bran who would both before her. If she fought for Jon she would most likely support his claim to the throne.
1.15. Cersei Lannister
1.15.1. Pro: She is the incumbent queen on the Iron Throne.
1.15.1.1. Pro: She only has to defend the throne which is easier than conquering it.
1.15.1.2. Con: Incumbents to the Iron Throne do not historically have a long life span.
1.15.2. Con: Many different enemies are coming for her and her family, while she has few if any allies left.
1.15.3. Con: She has killed more people than anyone else and no one will fight for her. Also she is filled with hate and can not properly sit on the Iron Throne.
1.15.3.1. Pro: She gained her power using such extreme measures that she will not be very popular with anyone.
1.15.4. Con: Cersei's arrogance will blind her to threats eventually, as even Jaime is on the verge of betraying her and she seems to think that that could never happen.
1.15.4.1. Con: She seems able to eventually recognise the threats, and is fairly ruthless about dealing with them.
1.15.5. Con: The viewers are tired of the Lannisters ruling King's Landing. The showrunners are likely to change things up when the series ends.
1.15.5.1. Con: The show has the habit of killing the characters who the viewer sympathizes with the most.
1.15.5.1.1. Con: The show has so far kept its most important characters.
1.15.5.1.1.1. Pro: Jon Snow was revived after being stabbed by his own men.
1.15.5.1.1.2. Con: Ned Stark was the main character of season one and was killed in season one. They enjoy killing off important characters.
1.15.5.1.2. Pro: Daenerys highly values justice which makes the viewers sympathize with her.
1.15.5.1.3. Pro: Honorable characters like Eddard Stark, Robb Stark and Barristan Selmy who were popular among viewers were all killed.
1.15.6. Pro: She knows how to play the game and is ready to do anything, even killing her own people.
1.15.6.1. Pro: She is a backstabber and will do everything in her power to make sure that she is in charge.
1.15.6.2. Pro: Cersei is the most ruthless character on the show. She will do anything to win.
1.15.6.3. Con: She does not know how to play the game though, she often just throws temper tantrums when something does not go her way, as seen by the ending of season 6, playing the game means currying allies and gaining favors from others, not blowing them up.
1.15.6.4. Con: Blowing up half the city to get rid of her enemies will probably not engender long-term loyalty from the people.
1.15.6.4.1. Con: Cersei did not have much loyalty from the people before. She knows how to manipulate in order to get her way. With many many years of this, she knows how to get her way in spite of this.
1.15.7. Con: She has built up seasons of viewers and kingdoms hating her. It is very unlikely that she will sit on the throne.  I do not think the show can end successfully with her as the winner.
1.15.8. Pro: She has sacrificed so much already \(lost her children, confession of adultery, walk of shame, etc.\) Now she has nothing to lose and will be a ruthless queen.
1.15.9. Pro: She has a big army behind her, including The Mountain.
1.15.10. Con: When she was a girl, she encountered a soothsayer in a swamp who told her she would have three children, all of whom would die prematurely, and that she would be queen only until she was replaced by a "younger, more beautiful" queen \(Sansa? Daenarys?\).
1.15.10.1. Pro: Cersei's three children all died prematurely.
1.15.11. Pro: -> See 1.12.1.6.
1.15.12. Con: She will not survive much longer.
1.15.12.1. Pro: She will die at the hand of Arya Stark.
1.15.12.1.1. Pro: This is very possible. Arya is determined to have her dead. But this may not happen until the very end of the show.
1.15.12.1.2. Con: While Arya is determined to see her dead, but she can not pull it off conclusively.
1.15.12.2. Pro: The witch in the swamp tells Cersei that the Valonquar \(little brother\) will choke the life from her. The prophecies have been coming true so far as her three children have died prematurely and perhaps she may be replaced with a younger more beautiful queen.
1.15.13. Pro: Cersei has access to wildfire, which has already proven to be an extremely powerful weapon.
1.16. Jon Snow \(Targaryen\) & Daenerys Targaryen
1.16.1. Pro: Even though it would be a very predictable ending, with Jon snow being the Commander of the nights watch and Daenerys having the dragons who can fight with fire, there is no stronger duo. Fighting with both ice and fire on one team would be essentially indestructible.
1.16.2. Pro: They are heirs to the Iron Throne. Jon is the promised prince and needs a female leader so his aunt/potential love interest will be by his side.
1.16.3. Con: They may be fighting for the same throne, without realizing that they are family members.
1.16.3.1. Pro: Bran Stark is far from Jon and Daenerys and Bran seems to be the only person who is left knowing this secret.
1.16.4. Pro: Both these heroes are powerful enough to become the winners of the Game of Thrones. One has dragons and an army, and the other is a good leader and fighter.
1.16.4.1. Con: So far there is no direct connection between the two that would allow such a conclusion.
1.16.4.2. Con: While it is true that Jon and Daenerys are likely to marry based on what we know, that does not necessarily mean they will end up ruling Westeros. We have seen larger curve balls before such as Ned and Robb's death.
1.16.4.3. Pro: Jon Snow has lots of potential, but he will never succeed alone. Therefore he needs a strong alliance. Daenerys having the dragons makes her the best ally.
1.16.4.3.1. Pro: To stop the White Walkers, dragons are the best weapon.
1.16.4.3.1.1. Pro: Dragons' fire may prove to be extremely useful against the White Walker threat.
1.16.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: The White Walkers have been shown to be averse to fire, which she has in large supply because of her dragons. Since they can fly, she could take out large swaths of the White Walker army without risking casualties. This may be the only thing that can currently stand against the White Walkers.
1.16.4.3.1.1.2. Con: Dragons cannot cover the entire army.
1.16.4.4. Pro: It is not about the Seven Kingdoms anymore. The picture is greater than that. It is about saving Westeros from the White Walkers. So Daenerys would marry Jon Snow, not only to rule the Seven Kingdoms, but beyond that - to rule the Seven Kingdoms so that together, her armies and the armies of the Seven Kingdoms, would unite to defeat the White Walkers. That is the only way to stop them.
1.16.4.5. Pro: Daenerys has already stated she is waiting to marry into a powerful alliance in Westeros. Jon Snow just won his last battle, effectively reclaiming the North from the tyranny that preceded. Now that Jon Snow has claimed back his home, he will be claimed and respected as the King of the North. The fact that he is also a Targaryen is even better. Targaryens inbreed to maintain power within the family. So a marriage between Daenerys and Jon would mean a huge army with wildilings, men and dragons.
1.16.4.5.1. Con: Jon did not win because of his skills in warfare, but because his sister made a pact with Littlefinger. Like previous situations in which Jon has gone into battle, his victory is dependent on his relationships with allies. It's uncertain how Sansa will proceed and Jon's continued success is far from probable.
1.16.4.5.2. Con: I think many have the same sentiment. I know I would love to see this happen. It would be an unlikely, yet popular love ending. But, we know GoT does not have a history of this. Not to be pessimistic, but realistically, if we are all hoping for this...there is a big chance this will not happen. \(Hopeful, but not likely\).
1.16.5. Con: There is little chance of Daenerys marrying or supporting a member of the Seven Kingdoms' nobility as she often gives foreshadowing as to how she will break the wheel of the Seven Kingdoms. Even if they found their common bloodline,there is a possibility that Jon would not accept it, or that Daenerys would not care.
1.16.5.1. Con: Daenerys has from the beginning shown that she is willing to partner in order to win her throne.
1.16.5.2. Con: Daenerys has already stated in the last season though that she would be willing to marry in order to secure an alliance as seen by her leaving Daario behind.
1.16.5.3. Pro: Daenerys has shown time and time again that she wants to crush all those who were part of ousting the Targaryens in the first place so it seems odd that she would team up with the Stark army, because they fought to take it from the Targaryens beforehand.
1.16.5.4. Pro: Daenerys does not really want to have anything to do with the past of her family, as the relationship to her brother and some conversations with Tyrion Lannister show. If she would find out about Jon Snow actually being a Targaryen, she would not want to ally with him.
1.16.6. Pro: Both of them are good characters and they love their people. Thus they would do anything to protect the closest ones. These similarities make it very probable that they would fall in love.
1.16.6.1. Pro: Daenerys saved the women when the Dothraki raided villages. She also freed the Unsullied and slaves in Astapor.
1.16.6.1.1. Con: Daenerys did this so that she could gain power and a following. Her intentions are not so altruistic.
1.16.6.1.2. Con: Daenerys murders those who do not bend the knee to her. This is the opposite of benevolent.
1.16.6.2. Pro: Jon Snow has always been loyal to his friends and just to his enemies.
1.16.6.3. Con: As Jon Snow is a Targaryen himself, they can not marry. But Daenerys is looking for a useful marriage.
1.16.6.3.1. Con: Targaryens believe in keeping it in the family though. In their history, they often married siblings.
1.16.6.3.2. Pro: They cannot marry, but they may fall in love, making it difficult if they may have to fight against each other for some reason not yet disclosed.
1.16.6.4. Con: Jon Snow would rather push for his sister to rule than engage in an incestual marriage. She may be okay with it, but I don't think that he would be.
1.16.6.5. Pro: At the end of the day both have interests that align and are both in positions where they could marry in the future. Both are generally well-meaning and considerate and they could take the throne together, but will not necessarily be married.
1.16.7. Pro: Now that it has been revealed that he is Targaryen, this is the most likely alliance in Game of Thrones.
1.16.7.1. Pro: Jon Snow may win the Game of Thrones and may marry Daenerys Targaryen, so, they both will become winners.
1.16.8. Pro: There is also the prophecy of the [three headed dragon](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/4q13vo/spoilers_everything_is_the_dragon_must_have_three/) that a lot of people think is going to show up next season. When there will be two established Targaryens it makes sense that they are both one head of the dragon and will work together with the third unknown head.
1.16.8.1. Pro: Some theorize that Tyrion is a Targaryen, which would likely make him the third head of the dragon.
1.16.8.1.1. Pro: Tyrion wanted a dragon when he was a child.
1.16.8.2. Con: There must be three winners for this argument to make sense. Only two are listed here.
1.16.9. Con: Daenerys has always focused on getting revenge on those that have ousted her family in the past - A union with Jon Snow would mean him having to sacrifice his relationship with the remaining Starks, which he would never do.
1.16.10. Pro: After all their trials, it would seem fitting that both Jon and Daenerys will get what they were fighting for all this time.
1.16.10.1. Pro: They once both "survived" a conspiracy against them which indicates their importance for the show. While Daenerys survived an attack by the Sons of the Harpy, Jon Snow was revived after being stabbed by his own men.
1.16.10.2. Con: -> See 1.8.4.2.
1.16.10.3. Pro: The are both true born and are entitled to the Iron Throne.
1.16.11. Con: If they are, in fact, directly related, there is no way that they could co-rule.
1.16.11.1. Con: If they seize all power they could establish a new order that allows them to co-rule.
1.16.11.2. Con: The Targaryen family have a long history of incest.
1.16.12. Con: This seems like the "obvious" way for things to end, which is not what a show that surprises at every turn seems likely to do.
1.16.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.2.
1.16.12.2. Con: Whether one is surprised or not does depend on one's expectations. Hence, an obvious ending could be most surprising.
1.16.12.3. Pro: George RR Martin is not known for writing fan service plotlines.
1.16.12.4. Con: But now that they are beyond George R.R. Martin's writing, even though he is consulting, HBO writers might not be as surprising.
1.16.12.5. Pro: George RR Martin has said the ending will be "bittersweet" and if Jon and Danaerys won it would be a happy ending. [time.com](http://time.com/4101276/game-of-thrones-ending-george-r-r-martin/)
1.16.13. Pro: This represents the alliance of the fire and ice
1.16.14. Con: Jon Snow is not  as vicious in his goals as Daenerys, he would not choose her after his previous relationship. After leaving his Black Brothers he would not tie himself into this rather than watch over his remaining family.
1.16.15. Con: -> See 1.7.17.
1.17. Daenerys Targaryen
1.17.1. Con: -> See 1.11.1.
1.17.2. Con: With the potential that Jon is a legitimate Targaryen getting the revelation of Rhaegar's annulment, Dany has a weakened claim
1.17.3. Con: Daenerys represents fire and the White Walkers represent ice, so both extremes are likely to clash and extinguish each other.
1.17.3.1. Pro: Daenerys, the maiden of light and the Night King, the lion of the night, may fight and the prince that was promised,AeJon Targaryen Snow, is the last hero who wields the Lightbringer, a flaming sword and brings the dawn. This makes Daenerys likely to die as a sacrifice for the greater good and would make a the bittersweet ending a reality.
1.17.4. Con: The [prophecy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7VuGknEfQY) Daenerys received in House of the Undying, might mean that she will not sit on the throne. \(She reaches the throne, but doesn't touch it\).
1.17.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.
1.17.6. Con: Daenerys is too mentally unstable to win the throne.
1.17.6.1. Con: Daenerys has shown that she is a smart ruler. She takes the matters of her people in to her own hands, and is less selfish than the previous rulers.
1.17.6.2. Con: She is probably not too mentally unstable to WIN the throne. To KEEP it is a completely different matter.
1.17.6.3. Pro: The Targaryen family has a long running history of insanity.
1.17.6.3.1. Pro: When Meereen is under siege by the Masters' fleet, Daenerys declares that she will destroy the Masters' armies, kill them all, and destroy their cities. Tyrion disapproves and explains the similarities between this plan and the one her father had for King's Landing when the Lannisters were at his door.
1.17.6.3.2. Pro: King Aerys II Targaryen was even killed by his own Kingsguard as he threatened to burn down King's Landing.
1.17.6.4. Con: Tyrion will not let her fall too far down the rabbit hole of insanity.
1.17.6.4.1. Con: Tyrion is no psychologist.
1.17.6.5. Pro: Daenerys seems to be on track of becoming the same bloodthirsty, insane conqueror as several of her ancestors. The people and lords of Westeros will do anything in their power to prevent this from happening again.
1.17.6.5.1. Pro: Daenerys recruited an army of gang-rapists.
1.17.6.5.2. Pro: Daenerys held an exact copy of Khal Drogo's speech, also someone who only conquered but did not really rule.
1.17.6.5.2.1. Pro: When Meereen is under siege by the Masters' fleet, Daenerys declares that she will destroy the Masters' armies, kill them all, and destroy their cities.
1.17.6.5.3. Pro: Daenerys did not even buy but steal an army of slaves who she still treats as such.
1.17.6.5.3.1. Con: Daenerys set the Unsullied free. They follow her out of personal belief.
1.17.6.5.3.1.1. Con: The Unsullied are completely broken by their masters right from childhood. They do not have such things as "own will" or "belief" anymore and Daenerys is just exploiting that fact.
1.17.6.5.4. Pro: Daenerys basically admits to Daario that she only wants to conquer, not to rule.
1.17.6.5.4.1. Con: Conquering by definition leads to ruling.
1.17.6.5.5. Pro: Daenerys regards the whole of Westeros as belonging to her, while she does not have a real claim on anything.
1.17.6.5.6. Pro: Daenerys and her army, her dragons and her politics probably already killed more people than any of the other candidates in this discussion.
1.17.6.5.7. Con: Westeros has been conquered and then ruled for 300 years once before by the bloodthirsty, more or less insane Targaryens.
1.17.6.5.8. Pro: Since she is a beloved character and the writers love to mess with us, turning her into a mad and horrible character is something they would do.
1.17.6.5.9. Con: Daenerys will not become like her Father. She is definitely trying to bring peace but you have to remember that a lot of the people are stuck in their old ways so once these people are gone then the new way will be accepted more by the younger people like Daenerys.
1.17.6.5.10. Pro: Crazy fan theory is [she might be going crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU2N_5ncnUA) like her dad Aerys II Targaryen, the Mad King
1.17.6.6. Con: Cersei has shown a lot of instability, as cunning as she is, it seemed to work in her favor at times.
1.17.6.7. Con: -> See 1.8.5.2.3.
1.17.7. Con: Daenerys has proven that she is incapable of ruling even a single city.
1.17.7.1. Con: Whilst she may have seen trouble she has never ultimately lost control of a city
1.17.7.2. Con: She may not be the best ruler, but she can certainly conquer and inspire her people, like Tyrion.
1.17.7.3. Pro: Daenerys did not manage to hold the great city-states of Slaver's Bay. While she conquered Meereen, the Good Masters retook control of Astapor and reinstated slavery there.
1.17.7.4. Con: She now has Tyrion Lannister to do that for her, she only has to provide the looks.
1.17.7.4.1. Pro: Tyrion's way of dealing with the upcoming civil war in Mereen shows that the work sharing can work out.
1.17.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.17.6.5.4.
1.17.7.6. Con: In Meereen, Daenerys was unsuccessful at balancing the two major powers in the city, the wealthier citizens, or the masters/slaves discourse. As neither powers were willing to compromise, the city was left in strife that Daenerys could not solve in order to allow peace in the city.
1.17.7.7. Con: Meereen is like a practice yard for Daenerys. She is learning how to rule.
1.17.7.7.1. Pro: Daenerys marrys Hizdahr for purely political reasons in order to maintain peace and to show her respect for Meereen.
1.17.7.7.2. Pro: After rejecting Hizdhar's advice to reopen the Fighting Pits in Meereen at first, Daenerys changes her stance for the better of the city.
1.17.7.8. Pro: Daenarys is too similar to many of the lords and ladies of ancient Europe ousted from their homes and looking to take back their lands. Few if any ever succeeded, and the empire she is creating will fall behind her just as the one Alexander the Great made as his men and followers were mighty and powerful, but his ambition and youthful naivete led to his downfall in the form of sickness instead of armies or assassination.
1.17.7.8.1. Con: There is no evidence that George R.R. Martin is basing Daenarys on Alexander the Great or is using that real history for inspiration.
1.17.7.8.2. Con: Just because her empire may fall behind her, may not mean she won't "win" the game, the throne, and be the ruler for at least a little while.
1.17.7.9. Pro: Daenerys takes the moral high ground to a fault. Her tendency to choose what is "right" over what is a better strategy could be her undoing.
1.17.7.9.1. Con: She has proven time and again that she is not above cruelty and murder - especially when it comes to revenge.  Perhaps in the earlier seasons, this argument held some weight but as things stand now, it fails to stick.
1.17.8. Pro: Daenerys has many groups of people and individuals supporting her cause and "birth right" to the throne \(e.g. Martells, Tyrells, Dothraki, Varys\).
1.17.8.1. Pro: Tyrion Lanister supports her cause.
1.17.8.2. Pro: The Martells are supporting Dany's cause.
1.17.8.2.1. Pro: That will give her a lot financial support.
1.17.8.2.1.1. Con: Money may not be much of an issue with the White Walkers.
1.17.8.3. Pro: The Tyrells are supporting Dany's cause.
1.17.8.3.1. Con: Following Ollena's death, House Tyrell is powerless at best and extinct at worst.
1.17.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.
1.17.8.5. Con: She has at least as many opponents as supporters.
1.17.8.5.1. Con: Yes, but she has dragons, and is gaining more popularity than a little bit.
1.17.8.5.2. Pro: Littlefinger is against her.
1.17.8.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.1.
1.17.8.5.3. Pro: Cersei Lannister is against her.
1.17.8.5.4. Pro: Euron Greyjoy is against her.
1.17.8.6. Pro: The Dothraki support her.
1.17.8.7. Pro: Varys supports her.
1.17.9. Pro: She is exceptionally talented at gaining a following. No one, up until Jon Snow in the latest season, has demonstrated any ability to win a following through any tactic other than fear.
1.17.9.1. Con: Jon Snow is not the only one to show power by something other than fear. The Lannisters have a great way to be cunning in their attempts to continue ruling. The fear we have of the Lannisters is because we know what they are capable of.
1.17.9.2. Pro: Daenerys is "the breaker of chains", she stands up for those enslaved and downtrodden and that will help her gain support.
1.17.9.2.1. Pro: All the soldiers and citizens follow and like her. So, they will all fight for her.
1.17.9.2.1.1. Con: Her followers tend to be the less powerful in society. She would be susceptible to organised uprising by those previously/concurrently holding power.
1.17.9.2.1.2. Con: Her tendency to prefer vengeance labelled "justice" is a trait she's unlikely to change. A rule in which she acts like this is likely to put her in similar situations with similar outcomes to that of the person who currently holds the Iron Throne.
1.17.9.2.1.3. Con: She has shown a history of not keeping all of her citizens on her good side. They will start being loyal to her but over time she loses control. She cannot maintain this habit when ruling all of Westeros.
1.17.9.2.1.3.1. Con: This has happened at King's Landing as well, under Cercei's rule. Control can be taken back.
1.17.9.2.1.3.2. Pro: Just look at what happened in Meereen.
1.17.9.2.2. Con: Some of the slaves do not want to be freed.
1.17.9.2.3. Pro: Daenerys actually cares about the people. She may make some poor decisions as a leader, but, she always tries to do the best she can for her people. She values freedom and cares about the every day person.
1.17.9.2.4. Con: As the "breaker of chains," she has also angered many powerful/rich people. They want to maintain their advantages and thus do not want Daenerys to rule.
1.17.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.17.9.2.1.
1.17.9.4. Con: Her ability to win is largely predicated on her ability to control her dragons. If she loses that control, or if the dragons are killed \(by White Walkers?\), she will be greatly diminished.
1.17.9.4.1. Con: There does not seem to be any evidence that the White Walkers are likely or able to kill a dragon
1.17.9.5. Pro: She seems interested in ruling only to the extent that ruling allows her to free the oppressed. Thus, she would likely enjoy legitimate popular rule were she to assume the throne, rather than a tenuous hold over people who do not believe in her.
1.17.9.5.1. Con: She's also shown on several occasions to struggle with containing her sanity and have given us reasons she could become the "Mad Queen" should she conquer the throne. Even if she never becomes as bad as the "Mad King", people have not forgotten about his madness nor will they forget who her father is. One act of seemingly minor insanity could be enough to turn people against her.
1.17.10. Pro: Dany has already been 'tested' in her mind \[by walking to her 'death' in the pyre\], she has nothing to lose in a sense \[since she has no brother/husband etc, and supposedly cannot have more children\] so her only objective is to take the Iron Throne to avenge her parents. No one else has 'nothing to lose', so in an important mental sense, she will be willing to go the hardest to win the throne.
1.17.10.1. Con: At this point Cersei does not really have anything left to lose either and she has the throne right now.
1.17.10.1.1. Pro: Cersei does not have the backing to take the throne the way she wants to and it would be never ending wars for her, if you consider all of the agony she has caused more than one kingdom over the seasons. However, she has a thirsty drive to stay on top and that may just be enough, regardless of her backing.
1.17.11. Pro: She is practically fireproof, as seen in [season 1 episode 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8zYeN9z8XY) & [season 6 episode 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-iZtx4QBkY). This ability will serve her well since she is the Mother of Dragons.
1.17.11.1. Con: While being fireproof is obviously very helpful, this does not mean that she is invulnerable to all attacks. She could very easily be killed in multiple other ways.
1.17.12. Con: Daenerys is a woman.
1.17.12.1. Pro: The Westeros \(except for Dorne\) men come before women in the line of succession.
1.17.12.1.1. Con: There are no trueborn male Targaryen children to be ahead of her in succession.
1.17.12.2. Con: -> See 1.4.6.1.
1.17.12.3. Con: If a person is a woman, it does not mean that she cannot win and control the country and people. In our case, she is a very powerful and very strong person, so, she will be able to become a winner and govern people. Daenerys has three dragons and even a huge army, people love and follow her.
1.17.12.4. Con: Daenerys succeeded even in the Dothrakis world, where women do not have any power.
1.17.12.4.1. Pro: Daenerys even trapped several Dothraki in a room and set them on fire in one episode.
1.17.13. Pro: Daenerys now has an army by water, air and land.
1.17.13.1. Con: Armies may be helpful in the claim of the Throne, but definetly not to keep it.
1.17.13.2. Con: Dany will have trouble maintaining her alliances. The Greyjoys are especially a concern. She has shown before that her choices in allies are not always wise.
1.17.13.3. Pro: Daenerys has the Greyjoys ships.
1.17.13.4. Pro: Daynerys has one of the most efficient ground troops.
1.17.13.5. Pro: Daenarys' dragons help her gain control of the Iron Throne.
1.17.13.5.1. Pro: Dragons were key to the Targaryens' power in the past.
1.17.13.5.2. Con: There is an unknown factor with Euron Greyjoy who in the books at least has a horn named dragonbinder which may show up next season that does exactly what its name says.
1.17.13.5.3. Con: Daenerys' dragons were one of the fundamental causes of unrest in Meereen.
1.17.13.5.3.1. Pro: But that showed their power and this will definitely be useful in the North when she needs to fight Cersei.
1.17.13.5.4. Pro: Daenerys' fire skills give her the power to take control over entire cities by intimidating the people.
1.17.13.5.4.1. Pro: The Dothraki seem to think that she is some kind of god.
1.17.13.5.4.2. Con: Daenerys' "fire skills" have not helped with Meereen.
1.17.13.5.4.3. Con: Intimidation can easily backfire for rulers.
1.17.13.5.4.4. Pro: Daenerys has already sacked Astapor and Yunkai and conquered Meereen and Vaes Dothrak.
1.17.13.5.5. Con: Existence of potential [ice dragons](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ice_dragons) undermines the power of her dragons and makes them less of a force to be feared.
1.17.13.5.5.1. Con: Only against the White Walkers, assuming they are the only ones with access to them.
1.17.13.5.5.1.1. Con: The [ice dragon](http://www.cracked.com/article_23706_6-game-thrones-fan-theories-just-insane-enough-to-be-true.html) apparently is in the lake at Winterfell which means Jon now has direct access to it.
1.17.13.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.16.4.3.1.1.
1.17.13.5.7. Con: Daenerys cannot control them efficiently enough.
1.17.13.5.7.1. Con: It is just a matter of time. If she will control the dragons she will be nearly invincible.
1.17.13.5.7.2. Con: The Targaryen family has a successful history of controlling dragons.
1.17.13.5.7.3. Pro: When Drogon saved Dany in the fighting pit of Meereen, he burnt Unsullied and innocent bystanders as well as the Sons of the Harpy.
1.17.13.5.7.3.1. Con: Accidents happen - it was all quite chaotic - and he still seemed to be targeting the right people.
1.17.13.5.7.4. Pro: When Drogon saved Dany in the fighting pit of Mereen, he took her away right into the middle of more trouble for her. Obviously she could not even control where to fly.
1.17.13.5.7.4.1. Con: As trouble in these cases is typically defined by the number and relative strength of hostiles surrounding her, trouble as a whole can be countered with enough fire. As The Unburnt, this applies even when Dany is dead smack in the middle of said trouble.
1.17.13.5.7.4.1.1. Con: While it would suffice to save Dany, any nearby allies would also be burnt to death.
1.17.13.5.7.5. Con: That appears to be changing more. Initially they caused relatively minor problems \(one or two burned up citizens\), but after their 'adolescence' they seem to accept her control much more. That is shown by the way that they rescued her, and were relatively in control \(e.g. not barbequing allies\) when she was ambushed in the stadium.
1.17.13.5.8. Pro: Her dragons proved to be very helpful several times.
1.17.13.5.8.1. Pro: The dragons saved her life during the Fighting Pits of Meereen.
1.17.14. Con: -> See 1.15.5.1.
1.17.15. Pro: Tyrion Lannister's guidance will help her stabilizing and strengthening her power.
1.17.16. Pro: George R. R. Martin does like to borrow from history as seen by the similarity to the War of the Roses and other historical wars and time periods. Daenerys sitting on the throne would be the equivalent to the Elizabethian era.
1.17.16.1. Pro: The great wall is copied from the [Hadrian's Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall) in Scotland.
1.17.16.2. Pro: A lot of characters are copied from history.
1.17.16.2.1. Pro: The character Bran is based on the celtic myth of [Bran the Blessed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%A2n_the_Blessed), which means in Welsh "The blessed raven".
1.17.16.2.2. Pro: Brienne of Tarth is based on [Joan of Arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Arc).
1.17.16.2.3. Pro: Khal Drogo and the Dothraki are similar to Genghis Khan and the Mongolian tribes.
1.17.16.3. Pro: Just like [Richard III of York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_III_of_England), Stannis Baratheon claims the throne, because his "nephews" are illigitimate.
1.17.16.4. Pro: The red wedding was copied from the [St. Bartholomew's night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew's_Day_massacre) in 1572.
1.17.16.5. Con: -> See 1.4.6.1.2.
1.18. Varys
1.18.1. Pro: Varys seems the only character who tries to bring about what is best for the realm.
1.18.2. Con: He does not intend to sit on the Iron Throne himself.
1.18.2.1. Pro: Varys has decided to follow Daenerys as he believes her rule would be the best for the preservation of peace and prosperity in the Seven Kingdoms.
1.18.3. Con: Varys has always been shown to work through others. Although plausible he would control Westeros. He would most likely do it through a puppet king.
1.18.3.1. Con: Perhaps, though, all of the working through the shadows has been one long game with the end goal of the throne in mind.
1.18.4. Pro: Varys possess immense political power.
1.18.4.1. Pro: He has a network of informants across two continents who convey him information needed to influence politics in Westeros.
1.18.5. Con: Melisandre told Varys, in episode 7x03, "I have to die in this strange country, just like you." Even though her prediction may not be correct, even he seemed to be worried about it.
1.18.6. Pro: Time and time again we have seen Varys manipulate from the shadows. He might just sit on the throne himself. He certainly has the intelligence for it, and the cunning, and the ruthlessness. He has all the qualities of the leaders.
1.18.7. Con: He does not come from one of the noble houses of Westeros.
1.18.7.1. Con: This is correct, but he has the same cunning and manipulation as Littlefinger. He has used that to gain his status and can potentially use it to gain the Iron Throne.
1.18.7.2. Con: If he wants it hard enough, he will get it. Dany's house is practically extinct and outcast, Littlefinger also wants the throne despite not being from a major house either, etc. Conquest triumphs nobility.
1.18.8. Con: Varys is a eunuch who will not be able to produce an heir. It does not make sense for him to sit on the throne.
1.18.8.1. Con: It may not matter to him whether or not he can produce an heir. He's concerned with himself and no-one else.
1.18.8.2. Pro: It is typical for those who take the throne to have an heir of their lineage to pass it along to. Varys cannot produce an heir.
1.19. Jaime Lannister
1.19.1. Con: Being the Leader of the Kingsguard does not allow him to sit on the Iron Throne.
1.19.2. Pro: After killing Aerys II he sat on the Iron Throne before vacating it to Ned Stark. This could be foreshadowing.
1.19.2.1. Pro: Jaime does have many good points about him to give him consideration. The Lannisters' reign may completely end or it may transform into a more humanitarian role, with Jaime leading the change needed to sit on the throne.
1.19.3. Con: He gave up his right to the throne when he agreed to be hand of the King.
1.19.3.1. Con: While he did agree to be the hand of the king, a lot has changed and so he can very well achieve the throne, the same as Jon Snow or anyone else void of royal stature.
1.19.4. Pro: He has been growing distant from Cersei and he might resent her recent actions enough to kill her.
1.19.5. Con: The "Kingslayer" would never be accepted as a king by the majority of Westeros' population.
1.19.6. Pro: -> See 1.12.1.6.
1.20. The White Walkers
1.20.1. Pro: GOT is an allegory for climate change. A theory that is growing in popularity is that the plot of GOT is about collective action theory and secretly an allegory for climate change.[GOT-theory.](http://www.salon.com/2015/06/04/is_game_of_thrones_an_allegory_for_global_climate_change/) If this theory is true, the White Walkers would likely be the winners of GOT.
1.20.2. Pro: In the TV show, the wall is currently broken and they started to go through.
1.20.3. Pro: The various families show no sign of banding together in a fashion that could defeat the entire army of White Walkers.
1.20.4. Pro: Winter is coming. This could foreshadow the downfall of humanity and a White Walker victory.
1.20.4.1. Pro: These words are repeated throughout the series as reinforcement.
1.20.4.2. Con: "Winter is coming" are the words of House Stark, potentially foreshadowing the Starks ruling after-all.
1.20.5. Pro: They have the strongest army.
1.20.5.1. Pro: The Night King possesses the ability to change humans into White Walkers.
1.20.5.2. Con: This is not the case now that dragons are back in the picture.
1.20.5.2.1. Pro: With the return of dragons, humans may create dragon glass which could spell the downfall of the White Walkers.
1.20.5.2.1.1. Con: In season 7, Jon Snow visits Daenarys in hopes of using the dragon to defeat the white walkers.
1.20.5.3. Pro: The White Walkers cannot be killed by regular weapons.
1.20.5.3.1. Con: Their weakness has been revealed and used to destroy them several times
1.20.5.3.1.1. Pro: They can be killed instantly when struck with weapons made of dragonglass or Valyrian steel, or when they're set on fire.
1.20.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.20.5.2.1.
1.20.5.4. Pro: The White Walkers only need a minimal initial army to invade, since they can add to it the undead bodies of their enemies.
1.20.6. Con: -> See 1.20.5.2.1.
1.20.7. Pro: The show has the habit of shocking the viewer by killing the most popular characters. Eliminating humankind in the end and making the White Walkers rule over the Seven Kingdoms would just be the ultimate shock.
1.20.7.1. Pro: It would be bleak and different enough for the White Walkers to win in the end. In this context they are not sitting on any throne per se, but the victory would still be theirs.
1.20.7.2. Pro: This might be the bittersweet ending, someone will finally claim the throne as everyone runs in fear of White Walkers, but ultimately the White Walkers win.
1.20.8. Con: This ending would nullify anything previously in the series that was done to prevent it.
1.20.8.1. Pro: Jon Snow's fight against the White Walkers would have been in vain.
1.20.8.1.1. Con: But this does not mean it could not happen.
1.20.8.2. Pro: The rebellion of the wildlings would not have any effect on what is going on beyond the wall.
1.20.9. Pro: No one has sent troops to the wall to defend the wall.
1.20.9.1. Pro: The rest of the realm is disunited and disbelieving that the White Walkers are coming.
1.20.10. Pro: If the White Walkers kill everyone then there will be nobody left to rule.
1.20.10.1. Pro: This fits the "White Walkers win the Iron Throne" option. Though they technically would not sit on the throne itself, they would have control over the Seven Kingdoms.
1.20.10.2. Pro: Very few people seem to be concerned about the White Walkers yet.
1.20.11. Pro: The future of 'A Dream of Spring' heavily implies that the end of the series will take place during a decades long 'winter-time', and Dany's vision of the Iron Throne room being burnt and dusted with snow will probably come true. Dany did not 'take' the throne in her vision, she just saw it was empty and the burnt out room was empty. There was no life there. When winter comes \[for real\] and the White Walkers come, there will be no one left surviving, therefore no one will 'get' the Iron Throne.
1.20.11.1. Con: The White Walkers need humans in order to regenerate their army - or grow it. They are unlikely to destroy all living beings.
1.20.12. Con: The White Walkers are not interested in sitting on the Iron Throne.
1.20.12.1. Pro: Their motivations are merely to kill humans and Children of the Forest.
1.20.12.2. Con: The White Walkers seem to have kings as well. They would surely like to rule the south if they invade. They may kill everyone in the south and claim as their own.
1.20.12.3. Pro: We have not been shown anything about the White Walkers' motivation other than that they want little babies to replenish their ranks with babies and kill people to raise an undead army.
1.20.12.3.1. Con: We know that the White Walkers are attacking the wall.
1.20.12.3.2. Con: We do not know enough about the White Walkers to know how they would act after they breach the wall.
1.20.12.4. Con: -> See 1.20.7.1.
1.20.12.5. Pro: What we have seen about the White Walkers suggests they are tools made to be weapons in vengeance. You would not be a tool on the throne.
1.21. Aegon Targaryen
1.21.1. Con: Having been written out of the show so far suggests that he is unlikely to ultimately ascend the throne.
1.21.1.1. Con: He may be a surprise addition to a future season, or even retconned to be an existing character we've seen such as Gendry \(wouldn't be the first time that two or more book characters have been "merged" into a single TV character\).
1.21.1.1.1. Pro: The story arc of a failed/slow conquest of Westeros seems to have been absorbed by Dany in the show and Aegon's name by Jon - suggesting that Aegon from the books might still play an important role as a Targaryen but the show has dropped the "dragon must have three heads" thread in favor of not introducing another main character.
1.21.1.2. Pro: If they were going to bring him in, they missed the perfect opportunity to and a season with a scene of the Golden Company storming the beaches of Westeros under a Targaryen Banner, and everyone expects Danny to step out. Surprise! It's someone you don't know!

Given that they didn't do that, and that would have been the best way to do it, I suspect he's not coming, and so he can't be integral to the final resting place of the story.
1.21.2. Pro: If Aegon is [still alive](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_Targaryen/Theories), he has a stronger claim to the throne than his Aunt Daenarys, as he is the grandson of the last Targaryen king.
1.21.2.1. Con: Even  if he is still alive, it is not a guarantee that he will reveal himself and go for the throne.
1.21.2.2. Con: It's pretty unlikely that he is who he says he is. Aegon is likely a Blackfyre pretender, or he might have a wholly fabricated story. In either of these, more likely, scenarios, he has no claim on the throne.
1.22. Jon Snow, Daenerys and Tyrion.
1.22.1. Con: Given that these are perhaps the show's three most popular characters, it seems unlikely that this "fairytale" ending comes to pass, given the show's tendency to shock/surprise.
1.22.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.2.
1.22.2. Con: There is no precedent for three individuals to take the Throne.
1.22.2.1. Con: Three might be a crowd, but they could split the land three ways if needed.
1.22.3. Pro: Daenerys and Jon both want peace, so they will likely rule in conjunction with each other, with Tyrion's guidance.
1.22.4. Pro: Between the three of them you have inspiration, courage and intelligence / cunning. The three together would make excellent rulers. Plus, Tyrion is liked by both Jon and Daenerys, he could gel them together and assist in overcoming any problems.
1.22.5. Pro: Daenerys has three dragons, upon which each of them shall ride in the final battle.
1.22.5.1. Con: -> See 1.17.13.5.2.
1.22.5.2. Con: There are only two dragons left currently.
