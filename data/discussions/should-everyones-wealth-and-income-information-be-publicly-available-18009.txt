Discussion Title: Should everyone's wealth and income information be publicly available?

1. Everyone's wealth and income information should be publicly available.
1.1. Con: Increased knowledge of others' financial status could cause jealousy and a breakdown in social ties.
1.1.1. Pro: There could be more crimes like thefts and kidnappings because criminals will now have the information to target wealthy people.
1.1.1.1. Con: It is already rather obvious to know who's rich and who's not by looking at a simple detail like the type of house that a person lives in.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Many people living modest lives or in small houses may have large amounts of assets or savings they are not spending.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: If a person does not want to obviously reveal their wealth, they can make choices to disguise their standard of living \(i.e., a less ostentatious home, etc\) but there is nothing they could do to protect their privacy if their financial records were accessible.
1.1.1.2. Pro: This would allow windows of opportunities for persons with interests in home invasion, identity theft, etc. to research their next victim to acquire one's assets, financials, etc.
1.1.2. Con: Jealousy is already present, no need to see income numbers to know someone is wealthier than you.
1.1.2.1. Pro: People already discriminate based on income on the basis of where someone lives, the clothes they wear and so on. It is unlikely that this policy would massively change the level of classism that exists currently.
1.1.2.2. Con: While this is true, knowing exactly how wealthy someone is -- especially if that number turns out to be much higher than previously thought -- will only serve to aggravate and intensify this feeling.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: The worse someone's jealousy gets, the more likely that they will act on it in a potentially vengeful or even violent manner.
1.1.3. Pro: This could lead to increased discrimination.
1.1.3.1. Pro: It could result in a crackdown on illegal immigrants, since the lack of proper income information for them might make them more easily identifiable.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Making this information publicly available could actually help illegal immigrants, since income/wealth transparency means that it would be more difficult for people to exploit them \(i.e. labor trafficking\) without it going unnoticed by the government.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: If these immigrants are illegal, it is unlikely they'll appear on state records meaning no income will appear for them.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: It could lead to people making complaints to the state about people they believe to be illegal immigrants based on stereotypes about their income, name etc. This could lead to these people being harassed by state authorities.
1.1.3.1.4. Con: From a governmental standpoint identifying illegal immigrants is a beneficial goal.
1.1.3.1.4.1. Con: Undocumented immigrants [pay more](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/13/17229018/undocumented-immigrants-pay-taxes) in taxes than they receive in benefits, producing a net economic benefit. Immigration crackdowns are bad policy.
1.1.3.1.4.2. Con: There are all sorts of scenarios in which it may not be universally true that it is in the interest of government to strictly enforce the letter of the law.
1.1.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: Under [gun buyback programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_buyback_program), citizens can sell their firearms to the police without prosecution -- even if the weapons were acquired illegally. As a result, there are fewer guns and violent crime has been observed to decrease.
1.1.3.1.4.2.2. Pro: As a rule, most Western countries do not negotiate with terrorists, in order to reduce the incentive for hostage taking. However, governments have been known to make [exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_negotiation_with_terrorists), such as the US in the Iran-Contra Affair and President Obama's dealings with the Taliban Five.
1.1.3.2. Con: Under certain versions of this policy \(for example, as implemented in Norway\) if an individual's financial records are requested they can be informed of the identity of the person submitting the request - which is a check against misuse.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Norway has pay transparency but has [banned anonymous searches,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-nordics/privacy-what-privacy-many-nordic-tax-records-are-a-phone-call-away-idUSKCN0X91QE) notifying a person of the identity of anyone [who searches for their information](https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2016/apr/11/when-it-comes-to-tax-transparency-norway-leads-the-field).
1.1.3.2.2. Con: Nothing prevents a person from turning around and disseminating the information they gain to other less-legitimate parties.
1.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Should an NDA be put in place for those who request the information, it could prevent further dissemination of the information.
1.1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Individuals who wanted to scrutinise someone else's finances could simply hire an investigative agency to search on their behalf, thus protecting their anonymity.
1.1.3.2.3. Con: Knowing the identity of someone checking your finances may lead the person whose finances are being investigated to intimidate individuals in order to stop them from attempting to make such an effort.
1.1.3.3. Pro: People might treat others differently based on whether they are rich or poor.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: It could lead to an increase in [bullying](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-40669239) people based on their wealth, particularly within schools.
1.1.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.1.3.3.3. Pro: Since socioeconomic class and race/ethnicity are often [interwined](https://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/minorities.aspx), a policy of wealth transparency could further aggrandize institutional racism and prejudice.
1.1.3.3.3.1. Con: It is equally plausible that more people will realise the effect someone's race can have on their wealth once they are able to see this difference.
1.1.3.3.3.1.1. Con: Increased awareness rarely leads to any change in the status quo.
1.1.3.3.4. Con: Having a better understanding of people's finances may also lead people to treat them better as they realize the hardships that those less fortunate go through on account of the minuscule comparative wage that they get.
1.1.4. Pro: Income and the role of money are closely related to who a person is. Both a show-off with little money, a humble person with a lot of money or anything that is in between, have the right be the person they want. This policy disrupts the individual freedom, in the way that a person will have to act in the way others expect him to according to his wealth.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Money defines class in society, class in society defines for a big part the life of an individual. Every individual has the right to be part of their "class" or not, and this policy could make that change more difficult.
1.1.4.2. Con: In certain situations wealth and income can be considered in parallel with communication and/or the ability to communicate more freely - "money talks". If for example, we understand that increased investment into campaigns increases likelihood of success, then we should also acknowledge that increased income/wealth has potential to enhance personal or commercial ability. Making such information publicly available could allow for increased critical foresight and refined thought processing.
1.1.5. Con: Even if jealously was created by this policy, this is worth the benefits of increased financial transparency and ability to correct for income inequality.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Jealousy only has a minor impact on people's lives and interactions. Income inequality, conversely, leads to people being unable to have as good a quality of life as other people.
1.1.6. Pro: Making everyone's income and wealth public would lead to people making judgments on their financial status and not who they actually are. Those with less income could become outcasts and those with wealth far more popular; even more so than it is now.
1.1.6.1. Con: This assumes that lots of people will take the time to look up the incomes of other people, which can be time-intensive. Most people will not have the time nor interest to do so.
1.1.7. Con: If the social ties were weak enough to be broken by the difference in income, then people should start forming bonds with those who don't discriminate based on finances.
1.1.8. Pro: Not disclosing incomes allows humble people to not allow perceptions of wealth to get them 'fake friends'. When wealth is disclosed then disingenuous people tend to appear to scam or [mooch](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2014/01/28/a-tale-of-two-incomes-how-to-handle-having-more-money-than-your-friends/#12dc965149a6) off of vulnerable and trusting, potentially good people.
1.1.9. Pro: Humility is upheld as a virtue in many world faiths and social norms. This includes not being showy with wealth or success, which would be difficult if one's income was constantly on display
1.1.10. Pro: Wealth is often treated as social status. Seeing someone at a higher status can fetishize them, lead to jealousy, or lead to personal shame over one's own struggles. Not disclosing / not being showy with wealth allows people to avoid these things and maintain friendships across income lines.
1.1.11. Pro: Our hyperconnected world already causes anxiety, envy and self-consciousness. Why should the public know such personal info on private citizens? Possibilities for misuse include a teacher checking their students' parents for wealth, or cops checking a name before starting a search of someone. Who would want to live their entire life wondering about the motives of people in their lives \(friends, lovers\)?
1.2. Con: Scrutiny of wealth should be done by experts.
1.2.1. Con: This policy does not prevent experts from continuing their work, it just offers the opportunity to others if they so chose.
1.2.2. Con: These experts are part of the most inefficient machine ever created: government. It is impossible for experts to cover everything, because their analysis can be cherry-picked and intended to obscure interests. If information was available to public scrutiny, it would give these people real "skin-in-the game."
1.2.2.1. Pro: Governments are often hugely [wasteful](https://www.businessinsider.com/government-waste-spending-sequestration-sequester-2013-3?IR=T#the-conservation-research-program-pays-millions-annually-to-farmers-who-dont-farm-parts-of-their-land-but-the-usda-miscalculated-the-soil-rental-rate-wasting-1145-million-that-could-have-been-put-to-better-use-2).
1.2.2.2. Pro: Many governments are [outdated](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180116-why-governments-are-broken-and-how-to-fix-them) and slow to act compared to how quickly society functions.
1.2.3. Con: There is zero assertion that opening documents to the public will decrease experts access or efficiency. On the other hand opening it to the public increases the potential for experts to access the data. Retired experts, privately hired experts \(media\), experts working in their own time, research professors and students would have access to real time data. The list is quite long.
1.2.4. Pro: Tax collection agencies can more easily scrutinise income to see if the legal amount of tax is being paid or if income is being moved abroad rather than the press or public. This is because tax collection officials are trained to spot mistakes in tax paid, are aware of tax laws, and are better at spotting potential illegal financial transactions \(money laundering, tax evasion\) than the public.
1.2.4.1. Con: Allowing the public to review information means they can refer potential tax evasion to the relevant authorities for review, allowing it to be found quicker than if the companies acted independently.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: Relying on the public to report potential tax evasion to the authorities is likely to create a large workload for the authorities while providing them with little useful information.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: Individual members of the public, who are not well-versed in financial and taxation issues, will not be well-placed to identify genuine cases of tax evasion. Their tips will often be misleading.
1.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: Individuals may report others for tax evasion on the basis of jealousy, personal grudges, or other ulterior motives.
1.3. Pro: This policy would reduce the incentive for adopting cryptocurrency, which would be an unfortunate loss.
1.3.1. Con: If cryptocurrencies are [risky for investors and the economy,](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/6/228046-risks-of-cryptocurrencies/abstract) this would be a good outcome.
1.3.2. Con: This policy could increase the incentive for individuals to make use of cryptocurrencies, as they seek new and more inventive ways to hide their income information.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Some financial sector officials are concerned that cryptocurrency is [less transparent](https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/10/boa-official-lack-of-cryptocurrency-transparency-makes-it-tough-to-catch-bad-guys/) than traditional transactions, making the system more likely to facilitate criminal activity.
1.4. Con: Enforcing this unnecessary policy would cost the government a lot of money. Many countries already have significant debt burdens and can not afford an additional expense.
1.4.1. Con: Debt is not [necessarily](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterpham/2017/11/23/is-debt-really-that-bad/) a bad thing.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Debt can be an indication of a growing economy. For example, nations such as China, use credit to grow their economies.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Higher levels of debt can indicate a greater ability to repay the debt \(if states could not repay the debt, lenders would not lend to them in the first place\) indicating a degree of confidence in the economy of a particular state.
1.4.2. Con: Lots of beneficial policies are costly. This is not necessarily a reason not to introduce them.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Free education is hugely [expensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_spending_on_education_\(%25_of_GDP\)) for states to implement, however they still do it as they realize the benefits of this policy.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Social Welfare policies come with [huge costs](https://fullfact.org/economy/welfare-budget/) however they are implemented due to their humanitarian and economic merit.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Environmental regulations add [additional costs](http://environmentalscience.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199389414.001.0001/acrefore-9780199389414-e-396) to producing goods however they still are in place due to the need to protect the environment.
1.4.3. Pro: When governments make financial decisions, it is a zero-sum game. Introducing this policy takes money away from more important causes such as healthcare and education.
1.4.3.1. Con: Government financial decisions are not a zero-sum game: printing money is always necessary when the economy creates something new, which means, for example, we don't have to give up public bridges to have computers.
1.4.3.2. Con: This policy could easily be funded via [higher taxes](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/lowest-earners-more-tax-richest-office-national-statistics-inequality-council-tax-vat-equality-trust-a7704331.html) on the rich without sacrificing any more important cause.
1.4.4. Con: Most countries have income tax and wealth tax. So this cost is already incurred. All that's left is a web site where you can find other people's basic tax information.
1.4.5. Con: Wealth transparency would enable taxation of wealth, rather than income, unlocking massive revenues for the government and enabling the redistribution of wealth from the top 1% to the bottom 99%. This would easily offset any government cost of managing and enforcing the disclosure of this information by private citizens.
1.5. Pro: Pay transparency would reduce inequality.
1.5.1. Pro: Wealth transparency could encourage more support for social welfare.
1.5.1.1. Pro: There is a [myth](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dr-simon-duffy/welfare-myth-poor-taxes_b_3053882.html) that those who are poor do not pay taxes. Seeing those individuals contributing makes people much more sympathetic to giving those individuals supports.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Debunking this belief would also remove this argument from politicians who use it as a justification to not support social welfare.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Understanding the large disparity that exists in incomes would make people more supportive of policies like a welfare state which would act as a safety net to benefit all.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: It is naive to assume that everyone has the same moral compass and that they'll choose to act on information in the same way.
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: Finland and Norway do [better](http://www.euronews.com/2018/04/26/which-countries-have-the-worst-income-inequality-in-europe-) than most of Europe when it comes to income inequality, indicating that this policy might be beneficial.
1.5.1.2.3. Con: Making data about income disparity more publicly available is unlikely to change the status quo, as society by and large is already fully aware of this issue yet that awareness hasn't led to significant policy changes in most countries.
1.5.1.2.3.1. Pro: In many countries, the higher socioeconomic classes are the ones with the political power to actually enact some measure of wealth redistribution; but since it is generally not in the interest of the rich to give up their wealth, there's no reason why making income data publicly available would suddenly catalyze a total change of heart.
1.5.1.3. Con: Despite the massive media coverage that [Occupy Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street) received, it didn't spur massive reforms for pay change despite the issue of wealth inequality and misuse of people's finances becoming public knowledge after the 2008 economic collapse.
1.5.2. Pro: Individuals that have more than the average would have more social pressure to do good for the public.
1.5.3. Pro: In Sweden, companies with more than 25 employees whose wage information reveals a gender pay gap face [fines and public pressure](https://www.ft.com/content/2a9274be-72aa-11e7-93ff-99f383b09ff9); which has caused Sweden's pay gap to decrease.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Within the same job/type of work, the Swedish gender pay gap is [only 6%](https://www.ft.com/content/2a9274be-72aa-11e7-93ff-99f383b09ff9).
1.5.3.2. Con: Finland, where tax returns are public, has a [gender pay gap](https://www.ft.com/content/2a9274be-72aa-11e7-93ff-99f383b09ff9) similar to that of the UK, which keeps financial information private.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: [Half of Finland's gender pay gap](https://thl.fi/fi/web/gender-equality/gender-equality-in-finland/work) is due to the fact that men and women tend to work in different industries because of entrenched institutional norms.
1.5.3.3. Con: Sweden's gender pay gap across the economy is [still 15%](https://www.ft.com/content/2a9274be-72aa-11e7-93ff-99f383b09ff9), which is comparable to the 18% gap in the UK where financial information is private.
1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.
1.5.5. Pro: Wealth inequality, which is on the rise, is an issue of major [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/06/the-richest-1-percent-now-owns-more-of-the-countrys-wealth-than-at-any-time-in-the-past-50-years/).
1.5.5.1. Con: Public concern is often rooted in self-interest. People vote for policies which will benefit them individually \([e.g. wealthy people vote for lower taxes](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2010/05/do-rich-people-always-vote-conservative)\). Simply because it is in the interests of some members of the public does not necessarily mean a policy is good.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: Insofar as we recognise people's right to vote in line with their own self interest, the fact that this may be a self interested action should not be the reason for a policy to not be implemented.
1.5.6. Pro: Increased media coverage and public discussion of high and unequal salaries may generate an impetus for change.
1.5.6.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.
1.5.7. Pro: If income information was made public, then there might be more attention paid to fixing the [gender gap](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/11/the-gender-gap-actually-got-worse-in-2017/) in people's salaries.
1.5.7.1. Con: -> See 1.5.3.2.
1.5.7.2. Con: It would be better to force companies to collect and release anonymised details of the gender-salary breakdown of their workforce without making every individual's information available, achieving this same effect while protecting privacy.
1.5.8. Pro: When information on income is publicly available, it is easier to call out wealthy individuals minimising their taxes paid \(e.g. by keeping money in offshore accounts\). Comparatively, when income is private this often only occurs when there are things such as data leaks e.g. [The Panama Papers](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers).
1.5.8.1. Con: Wealth which is deliberately concealed offshore for the purposes of tax avoidance is unlikely to be publicised under this policy, since it is placed outside the national jurisdiction for the explicit purpose of concealment.
1.5.8.1.1. Con: While locating or taxing such money may be difficult, this policy will make it straightforward in certain cases to identify that avoidance is happening. When an individual's salary is [redirected offshore](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/19/tax-scheme-jimmy-carr-hmrc) and disappears from the books, for example, it will be clear that they are avoiding tax.
1.5.9. Con: -> See 1.5.3.2.
1.5.10. Con: Pay transparency will not improve the political capital of low wage workers, without which meaningful reforms against income inequality are unlikely to occur.
1.5.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.2.3.
1.5.10.2. Con: Increased access to workplace financial information reduces information asymmetries and [improves the bargaining position](https://www-jstor-org.tkc.idm.oclc.org/stable/24756355) of workers.
1.5.10.2.1. Pro: Increased information about compensation \(at a particular company, or across an industry\) will help workers make informed decisions about which jobs to pursue and how to approach negotiations, giving them more leverage to be offered a fair wage.
1.5.10.3. Con: -> See 1.5.6.
1.5.11. Con: Inequality is an inherent part of a capitalist economy to motivate workers to go higher up the ranks. That inequality \(along with self-actualisation they receive when they do move up\) needs to exist in order to give workers a motivation to do better.
1.5.11.1. Con: Economic inequality has a range of negative [social consequences](https://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/consequences-economic-inequality/), including worse health outcomes and higher rates of crime.
1.5.11.2. Con: Higher rates of economic inequality are [associated](https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/economic) with economic instability and lower rates of growth.
1.5.11.3. Con: There will still be pay differences between those in higher positions in companies compared to those in lower positions. People will still be incentivized to work hard.
1.5.11.3.1. Con: Pay differences will be harder to continue if people know exactly how much their superiors are making.
1.5.11.4. Con: Whether someone can move up the ranks is not just a question of 'motivation' but is determined by their connections, education levels and social privilege.
1.5.11.5. Pro: Salary increases are what motivate people to stay within a company and try and obtain a promotion, as they see the perks that their superiors can enjoy.
1.6. Pro: Pay transparency would improve business practices and employee experiences.
1.6.1. Pro: Public information about wages would prevent companies from [pay discrimination](https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/business/gender-pay-gap-78-of-uk-firms-paying-men-more-than-women-835933.html).
1.6.1.1. Pro: Being able to easily see how much companies pay individuals would make it easier to call out unfair pay practices where they exist.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Knowing how much money fellow workers make would make it easier for employees to demand pay raises from employers.
1.6.1.3. Con: If accused of pay discrimination as a result of this policy, a company could easily play it off by saying that any disparity in employees' income is simply due to the varying quality of their work.
1.6.2. Con: If pay transparency causes a flattened pay structure where pay is not tied to performance, it is likely to [drive away top talent.](https://hbr.org/2016/09/the-case-against-pay-transparency)
1.6.2.1. Con: While this may be a sound argument against pay transparency for individual organizations, it is unlikely that implementing pay transparency on a national \(or even global\) scale would ever lead to flattened pay structures all across the board.
1.6.3. Con: Most workers have an inflated assessment of their performance [as above average](https://hbr.org/2016/09/the-case-against-pay-transparency), and would likely become dissatisfied if they saw their relative pay.
1.6.4. Pro: A company choosing to show all workers what they are paid would improve the trust those workers have within that company.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Tech company [SumAll](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/pages/0914-salary-transparency.aspx) has pay transparency and has a very low staff turnover rate as staff have more faith in the actions of the company.
1.6.4.2. Pro: According a [2015 survey by PayScale](https://www.ft.com/content/2a9274be-72aa-11e7-93ff-99f383b09ff9) of 70,000+ US employees, the more people knew about why they earn what they earn, especially in relation to their peers, the less likely they were to quit.
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: PayScale [found](https://www.ft.com/content/2a9274be-72aa-11e7-93ff-99f383b09ff9) that “open and honest discussion around pay was found to be more important than typical measures of employee engagement” — career advancement, say, or earning the approbation of one’s boss.
1.6.4.3. Con: Pay transparency within a company could breed jealousy amongst people who are paid less than their co-workers, damaging cohesion in the workplace.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: Studies have shown that pay transparency increases [dissatisfaction](http://Employees who suddenly discover they are “underpaid” become more dissatisfied with their employer and more likely to depart.) among those who are paid below the median wage.
1.6.4.3.1.1. Con: It is perfectly plausible that studies demonstrate this because workers have just cause to be dissatisfied. They are entitled to know how their employers are treating them and may benefit from that knowledge.
1.6.4.3.1.1.1. Con: Even if true, if these workers are unable to get pay raises this dissatisfaction could reduce their productivity.
1.6.4.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.
1.6.4.3.1.3. Pro: [Studies](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/pages/0914-salary-transparency.aspx) have shown that productivity falls among workers who know they are being paid less than other workers for the same job.
1.6.4.3.1.3.1. Con: If workers know they are being paid less, they may be able to lobby for more fair compensation - which would avoid the damage to morale.
1.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.10.2.1.
1.6.6. Pro: Income transparency would enable fairer pay negotiations between employers and job candidates leading to better outcomes for employees and less leverage for employers. The middle class / workers would benefit.
1.6.6.1. Con: In theory, this makes sense, but some things like work ethic and passion can't be quantified by numbers or statistics. Some companies often hire based on employee flexibility and personality, etc. Those characteristics can be extremely important for very small companies.
1.6.7. Con: -> See 1.6.4.3.1.
1.6.8. Con: Just sharing wealth and income information leaves out important facts such as how was the wealth accumulated. In the past when regulations forced CEOs to be more transparent about their income, the rate of CEO income increased dramatically. The reason is that CEOs could compare their salaries and performance to other CEOs and made it much easier for CEOs to ask for large raises.
1.6.8.1. Con: The increase in CEO pay at this period was because of the introduction of options as remuneration. It is a long claim to connect transparency to this loophole being exploited
1.6.9. Pro: International companies that use bad corporate practice would avoid markets with this practice in place, thus helping the economy and allowing new entrants to sectors hamstrung by bad actors in other parts of the world
1.6.10. Con: With or without public information on income, people can still know if inequality exists yet this does not always lead to changes in business practices.
1.6.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.
1.6.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.2.
1.6.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.10.
1.6.11. Con: Simply because one is able to know their fellow workers' pay does not make their work experience better. Since things like salary are often based on abstract ideas, knowing that one's coworker in the same position is paid more does not give one a bargaining chip if your company is unwilling or unable to pay you more.
1.6.11.1. Pro: Having knowledge that one's coworkers are making more than them in a similar position and being unable to do anything about it may make one feel inadequate or inferior.
1.6.12. Con: Pay transparency may make running a business harder as businesses struggle to pay their employees similar salaries while competing with other businesses.
1.6.12.1. Con: This is a good thing, as it will ensure that the businesses that succeed do so on a foundation of equitable financial practices like fair pay.
1.6.12.2. Pro: While having a clearer idea of how much everyone is paid may lead to a more free capitalist model, it will lead to massive competition.
1.6.12.2.1. Pro: If every company knows how much its competitors are paying their top employees, it can use it as a bargaining chip to buy out all the talent from less wealthy businesses.
1.6.12.2.1.1. Con: This would concentrate power in a small number of companies, leading to the development of harmful [oligopolies](https://wootrader.com/the-problem-with-oligopolies/) or [monopolies](http://arnoldkling.com/econ/markets/monopoly.html).
1.6.12.2.1.2. Con: Companies can already offer large salaries to attract workers to leave competing companies.
1.6.12.2.1.2.1. Con: There is a difference between speculating how much an employee may be worth vs knowing how much they are exactly paid.
1.6.12.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Many talented people in a job market may be paid a lot less or non talented people a lot more than companies assume them to be paid.
1.6.12.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Employees often disclose their pay and what they would desire to be paid if they move company during negotiations.
1.6.12.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: With no current system of monetary transparency in place, employees will often inflate their current pay rate so as to ensure that they will be offered more during negotiations with other potential employers.
1.6.12.2.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: If an employee is able to gain more pay in negotiations using this method it is unfair to remove this option from them.
1.6.12.2.1.3. Con: If one company values an individual more than another company that person should have the opportunity to be offered more money and to move to where they are paid more.
1.6.12.2.1.4. Con: Workers do not automatically move company when they are offered slightly more money. Other factors like company culture and job benefits are also taken into consideration.
1.7. Pro: This policy would make it much harder to commit and get away with crime.
1.7.1. Pro: If everyone's monetary information was available, it would be harder to commit crime since it would be more obvious when someone's spending habits don't match their declared income.
1.7.1.1. Con: Many people who are paid under the table do so without any criminal intent but simply because those are the only jobs they can find. Such a policy would disproportionately target and harm them.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: If someone is paid under the table then they are still required to file taxes, they would just do so by filing it as [self-employment income](https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/2596183-my-income-was-paid-under-the-table-how-do-i-file-my-taxes-how-do-i-claim-my-income). If they fail to do this then they are evading taxes and therefore should be targeted by this policy since they're committing a crime.
1.7.2. Con: This would inevitably lead to people who are vulnerable \(ie old and frail folks\) being targeted by criminals who see soft targets.
1.7.2.1. Pro: If a high net worth individual is frail \(by virtue of frailty/age/disability etc\) then public knowledge of their net worth would be an invitation to someone to exploit them
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: For example an employee working as a live in carer for a person with dementia who is unable to make financial decisions for themselves
1.7.2.2. Pro: Crime against people \(specifically financial crime\) would be easier because their financial status would be known.
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: This is because criminals would only need to find out less information about a person before they target that person since they would already know whether the potential target is a “lucrative” prospect.
1.7.2.2.1.1. Con: It is already relatively easy to identify wealthy targets, for example by profiling them based on where they live or how they dress.
1.7.2.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.7.2.2.2. Con: An awareness that financial information was now transparent would jolt people out of their current false sense of security, encouraging them to take proactive steps against financial crime.
1.7.2.3. Con: If everyone accepts that everyone’s worth is public then it follows that people who act as safeguards \(family/friends/guardians\) would take much more precautions to safeguard those who are unable to safeguard themselves
1.7.2.4. Con: Governments and law enforcement would inevitably create safeguards to prevent mass scale financial crime
1.7.2.5. Con: That is already the case in the world as it is. A criminal in a street is much more likely to snatch a purse from an old lady and run rather than going for a younger, more athletic human being.
1.7.2.5.1. Pro: Elderly people find it harder to report crime and more likely to [not detect things](https://www.protectmyid.com/images/education_center/pdf/040WhoIsAtRisk/2_at%20risk_senior%20citizens.pdf) such as discrepancies in their account statements.
1.7.2.5.2. Pro: 5.4 percent of older adults [experience](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-seniors-fraud/financial-scams-target-millions-of-older-americans-annually-idUSKBN19Z1P3) some form of fraud or scam each year since criminals already believe the elderly to be a more susceptible class.
1.7.2.5.3. Pro: There are unique [forms of crime](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes/seniors) that are specially directed towards the elderly on account of the traits they possess as a social group.
1.7.2.5.4. Con: Even if this is true, making it easier to exploit elderly people is not a good thing.
1.7.2.6. Con: Old people are already generally associated with wealth since they've been seeing as living their lives and settling down so therefore have paid off their mortgages and not be broke like most young adults. The proposed policy in the topic does nothing to oust them.
1.7.2.6.1. Pro: The baby boomer generation in America is already seen as [wealthy](https://www.ftadviser.com/investments/2018/04/06/baby-boomers-17-times-more-wealthy-than-millennials/) and privileged.
1.7.2.6.2. Con: There is a vast difference between someone being "wealthy" and someone simply being "not broke." Just because someone is not living hand-to-mouth does not mean that they are well-to-do; and it is likely that most people understand this.
1.7.2.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.7.3. Pro: Pay transparency can reduce tax evasion as more people can view one's income.
1.7.3.1. Pro: When someone's wealth and income are a matter of public record, it should be straightforward for journalists and public or private investigators to assess whether they have paid an appropriate amount of tax.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: Just as individuals [currently](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/offshore-tax-havens-how-do-work-what-done-change-paradise-papers-panama-bermuda-caymans-turks-caicos-a8039916.html) hide their assets offshore in order to evade tax, so too will they do so under this policy - such hidden assets will likely never be included in their public wealth records.
1.7.3.1.1.1. Con: The effectiveness of this strategy depends on whether other countries opt for the same level of monetary transparency: if this policy is ever enacted on a global level, then offshore bank accounts won't hide anything.
1.7.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The economies of places such as the Cayman Islands are hugely [reliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Cayman_Islands) on offshore banking. They would not adhere to this policy and risk losing this industry.
1.7.3.2. Con: Tax collection agencies already do tackle tax evasion; given they currently have access to the information that would be made public, there is unlikely to be increased knowledge of tax evasion.
1.7.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.7.3.3. Pro: Decreased opportunities for tax evasion would significantly boost people's trust in the government treating everybody fairly, thus increasing participation and support for democracy.
1.7.3.4. Pro: Transparent wealth and income information would make it possible for the public to scrutinize "tax planning" strategies and push officials to make sure people follow the spirit, rather than the letter of tax laws by closing loopholes and fixing legislation
1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.7.5. Con: Financial crime currently exists by defrauding tax collection agencies. These agencies employ experts, with training in taxation law, and their [job](https://books.google.ie/books?id=v9U3DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=tax+collection+agencies+financial+crime&source=bl&ots=-wBGucQSzk&sig=ZzRDjP5a04T-2lrCe_XrNlg6X70&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjrs5Kv3djdAhWN2KQKHWdhDJs4ChDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=tax%20collection%20agencies%20financial%20crime&f=false) \(p.103\) is to look for evasion. Even with all this training, if these people are defrauded, then it is unlikely that random members of the public are going to be able to catch or prevent financial crime.
1.7.6. Pro: Terrorist and criminal financing often involves bank transfers due to the value of the sums of money. Publicly declared income can highlight certain irregular incomes such as these.
1.7.6.1. Con: These organisations will still use untraceable forms of banking such as cash or [shell corporation](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/13/474101127/want-to-set-up-a-shell-corporation-to-hide-your-millions-no-problem?t=1539894440484) payments to avoid this scrutiny.
1.7.6.1.1. Pro: Transactions could be paid to others through a trust or using a limited liability company to [hide the origin of the payment](https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-make-payments-and-bank-anonymously-315816).
1.7.6.2. Con: Restrictive policies only affect those that obey them. Terrorists and criminals by definition will circumvent the system.
1.7.6.2.1. Con: These actors will of course be willing to circumvent the rules, but they will have a hard time doing so when their transactions are a matter of public record.
1.7.7. Con: [Money Laundering](https://www.eater.com/2016/9/1/12533030/money-laundering-restaurant) is a well known but often practiced technique of criminals, making incomes look legitimate. Making incomes visible would simply drive up money laundering techniques and businesses.
1.8. Pro: This policy would improve the transparent functioning of politics.
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.
1.8.2. Con: People might be fired from their jobs for donating to "the wrong politician" or an unpopular political cause.
1.8.2.1. Con: Presumably laws preventing discrimination based on political beliefs could prevent this from occurring.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: District of Columbia, New York, and Puerto Rico have [anti-discrimination laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_discrimination_law_in_the_United_States) worded around political beliefs.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Irrespective of laws which may exist, the practice of firing people[has occurred](https://www.quora.com/I-got-fired-for-supporting-Trump-at-a-company-in-Silicon-Valley-Where-do-I-go-from-here-not-Grub-Hub). Making this information public will make it easier.
1.8.2.3. Pro: This may further polarize politics by affecting further employment based on job history with certain political affiliated companies. Resulting in working for a company being a political issue.
1.8.2.4. Con: Even if wealth and income are publicly available, how people choose to spend that wealth would be kept private.
1.8.3. Pro: The increased transparency would help prevent corruption among political leaders.
1.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.
1.8.3.2. Pro: Politicians would no longer be able to hide or lie about their financial interests when running for office or making policy decisions.
1.8.3.2.1. Pro: There is substantial evidence that Donald Trump has [exaggerated](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/05/donald-trump-net-worth) his personal wealth in order to convince the American public that he is a good businessman.
1.8.3.2.1.1. Con: Trump is an exception to most political norms. His actions are not reflective of a typical politician.
1.8.3.2.2. Pro: Politicians can currently [refuse](https://newrepublic.com/article/147310/can-states-ban-trump-ballot-doesnt-release-tax-returns) to release their tax returns and other financial information, making it difficult to account for their finances and therefore to know whether their financial interests are influencing their actions.
1.8.3.2.2.1. Pro: Secret financial interests can help politicians get away with [insider trading](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-08-10/congress-s-guide-to-insider-trading-and-corruption), whereby their political actions serve to enrich themselves.
1.8.3.2.2.2. Pro: Financial secrecy may facilitate [lobbying](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/12/lobbying-10-ways-corprations-influence-government) behind closed doors, giving wealthy donors disproportionate political influence.
1.8.3.2.2.2.1. Con: Lobbying is an important and necessary part of the legislative process.
1.8.3.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: Lobbying [helps](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/043015/why-lobbying-legal-and-important-us.asp) to provide important information to politicians and to assist them in comparing the various interests of their constituents.
1.8.3.2.2.2.1.2. Con: Even if lobbying is necessary, it is important that it be transparent so that voters can gauge the ways in which their representatives are being influenced by donors.
1.8.3.2.2.2.1.2.1. Con: There already exists dedicated legislation for the [regulation](https://lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/amended_lda_guide.html) of lobbying.
1.8.3.2.2.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Current lobbying regulations are inadequate.
1.8.3.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Lobbyists are frequently able to [get away](http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/sites/default/files/LDA%20Fact%20Sheet%20FINAL%207-28-15.pdf) with not registering as such due to weak enforcement.
1.8.3.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Because they focus [narrowly](https://lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/amended_lda_guide.html) on political donations above a certain amount, lobbying regulations fail to make the financial interests of politicians transparent to the same extent as would be achieved by this policy.
1.8.3.2.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.8.3.2.2.2.1.2.1.
1.8.3.2.2.2.3. Con: Lobbying is often done by funding [super PACs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee), and these donations are given to organisations rather than individuals so they would not be disclosed.
1.8.3.2.3. Con: Their financial interests can still be known or speculated as often information about political donations is [public](https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topindivs.php).
1.8.4. Pro: It would reduce fraud in government benefits, including insurance, food stamps, free and reduced lunch program, income taxes, and financial aid.
1.8.5. Pro: Publicly available information allows NGOs to run more efficiently, and as NGOs write most policy and then submit it to lawmakers, this could improve the quality of public policy.
1.8.6. Pro: Journalists and the media would have increased access to information that can help them check the financial interests of politicians.
1.8.7. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.2.
1.8.8. Con: Transparency may not always be ideal. Not all information that goes through governmental bodies is for the public to scrutinize and critique.
1.8.8.1. Con: This is true of national security information, where enemies of the state may use the information in a negative way. It is not the same with a politician's personal income.
1.8.8.2. Pro: Government actions that are covert in nature or sensitive rely on a freedom to not be answerable to the broad public. Having wealth and income information public necessitates that government financing be clear too.
1.8.8.2.1. Con: Governments will still be able to keep information covert by claiming this spending is for different things and that these employees work in other areas.
1.9. Pro: People would have less incentive to buy material things to make them appear wealthier than they are since their actual wealth would be visible to the public.
1.9.1. Pro: Societal pressures due to that visibility would cause people to save more and spend less, leading to more fiscally responsible activity.
1.9.2. Con: It's not completely evident that this is a positive effect. Industries producing "material things" are still good jobs. Vanity is not inherently immoral.
1.10. Con: Income and wealth can come from many sources and take many forms. It would be nearly impossible for figures to be accurate because it would have to take everything into account.
1.10.1. Pro: This policy lacks efficacy in economies where monetary transfers are in cash.
1.10.1.1. Con: There are ways to estimate [individual wealth](https://academic.oup.com/wber/article-abstract/2/1/123/1675838?redirectedFrom=PDF) and [natural capital](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2018/01/30/the-changing-wealth-of-nations-2018) in developing nations. This could simply involve publishing income tax data.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: [Some countries](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/countries-without-income-tax.html) do not collect personal income tax.
1.10.1.1.2. Con: In countries with largely cash-based economies, many individuals [pay no income tax](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/data-shows-only-1-of-population-pays-income-tax-over-5000-pay-more-than-1-crore-2779065/) because financial records are poor.
1.10.1.2. Pro: This problem is compounded in developing nations where the majority of transfers are in cash and often include barter.
1.10.2. Pro: Economic structures and their usage are [radically different](https://www.economist.com/feast-and-famine/2012/04/20/the-poor-are-different) in various areas of the world. Implementation in places where people's income is hard to determine would be a complex affair.
1.10.2.1. Pro: Making a one size fits all policy is lacking any partiality to local customs and norms. Making a policy such as this is a desensitized way of dealing with the problems it seeks to address by not taking into account local sentiments.
1.10.2.1.1. Con: This policy does not have to be one size fits all. If certain customs or economies of certain countries prevent this policy from working then the policy can be tailored to suit those issues.
1.10.2.1.1.1. Con: The policy does not leave room for subjective interpretation. It is rather straight forward and rather uniform.
1.10.2.1.1.1.1. Con: All policies are implemented by governments who know the best way a certain policy would work in their country.
1.10.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Certain types of governments, such as dictatorships and other authoritarian regimes, frequently enact policies based on self-interest rather than on considerations of what would be best for their people.
1.10.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Government members in democratic nations are merely vessels for the will of the citizenry, and therefore are typically not subject matter experts on many of the issues they are working with. This lack of knowledge means that governments often do not know the best way that a certain policy would work and consequently end up implementing policies that turn out to be detrimental to their country.
1.10.2.1.1.2. Pro: The EU often enacts policies through [directives](https://europa.eu/european-union/eu-law/legal-acts_en). These directives set out a goal the EU wants to achieve, but allows individual countries to achieve this goal by setting their own rules and laws.
1.10.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: The EU directive [93/104/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:31993L0104) sets out guidelines concerning working hours, with the maximum number of working hours set at 48 per week. The Irish [implementation](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/hours_of_work/working_week.html) of this policy does not allow normal workers to exceed this number, however the English implementation allows for individuals to [opt out](https://www.gov.uk/maximum-weekly-working-hours) of this limit.
1.10.2.1.1.3. Pro: If most transactions in a country are conducted through cash, limits on the value of cash purchases or rules to record purchases made through cash could be implemented. This would make it easier to track cash spending, and thus people's income.
1.10.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Laws regarding limits on purchases made in cash and mandatory recording of large cash purchases have been implemented by many [EU states](http://abroad.cash/uncategorized/cash-payment-limit-in-the-european-union/).
1.10.3. Pro: Assessing wealth is based on a variety of [factors](https://ete-online.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-7622-4-4). Sometimes even these factors are not satiated as too little information is available. It stands to reason that the policy would be harder to enforce in areas where governments don't have a stricter check and balance on their citizen's transactions.
1.10.4. Con: Nearly all government policies lack efficacy to a certain extent. That is not necessarily a reason not to introduce them.
1.10.5. Con: The form of transactions does not change the underlying wealth which is transferred.
1.10.5.1. Con: The form of the transaction matters because cash transfers are exceedingly [difficult](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-37974423) to track, making this policy difficult to implement in cash-heavy economies.
1.10.6. Con: In poorer countries where corruption is a major problem, governments are much less likely to enforce this policy since the people whose wealth has been accumulated illegally are often those in positions of power.
1.10.6.1. Pro: In the case of countries where leaders have great personal stakes in their countries economies such as autocratic states and harsh military or oligarchical regimes, the people within the government themselves risk having themselves being toppled over if they make wealth information public.
1.10.6.1.1. Pro: Recently the prime minister of Pakistan was dismissed from office and imprisoned after [courts ruled](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/from-panama-papers-to-upcoming-prison-term-how-nawaz-sharif-was-finally-nailed/articleshow/64974498.cms) that the wealth information that the [Panama papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/) presented meant that the prime minster had been under-representing his wealth and was therefore unfit for office.
1.10.6.1.2. Con: This would be true of a large number of beneficial policies. Just because illiberal states could not implement this policy does not make it a bad policy.
1.10.6.1.2.1. Pro: For example, many illiberal states restrict freedom of speech and freedom of the press to keep the regime stable. This does not make these things inherently bad.
1.11. Con: Making everyone's monetary information available to the public is a gross invasion of personal privacy.
1.11.1. Pro: [Information privacy](http://gilc.org/privacy/survey/intro.html), including the collection and dissemination of personal financial data, is recognized as a fundamental human right across the world.
1.11.1.1. Pro: The UN Declaration of Human Rights, among other international and regional treaties, recognizes a [right to privacy](http://gilc.org/privacy/survey/intro.html) as key to protecting human dignity and other values such as freedom of association and freedom of speech.
1.11.1.2. Pro: Protecting financial privacy is key to protecting a persons freedom of associations and freedom of speech, because revealing their financial data would implicitly disclose the person's relationships and actions.
1.11.1.3. Con: This right is not absolute, and there are many legal exceptions recognized.
1.11.1.3.1. Pro: Any individual's right to privacy must be balanced against the interests of the state in protecting the general social welfare.
1.11.1.3.1.1. Pro: Very few rights are absolute and are often violated by the State including at times the right to life \(e.g. by a death penalty sentence, by allowing police to use firearms\). Considering that the right to life is more important that the right to privacy, then if life is not an absolute right, privacy should not be one.
1.11.1.4. Pro: There is no reasonable expectation of publicity when it comes to income. For example, exposing everyone's wealth/income in the U.S. would be a violation of our [4th amendment right](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment) \(the right to unreasonable searches\).
1.11.1.4.1. Con: The automatic publication of some data does not constitute a 'search', which is a forceful and targeted invasion of privacy. Many forms of personal information, such as political contributions, are already publicised without violating the Fourth Amendment.
1.11.2. Con: -> See 1.11.1.3.1.
1.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.11.4. Con: Personal privacy should be distinguished from financial privacy. Financial privacy is illusory - our financial information is already available to [banks](https://www.independent.co.uk/money/spend-save/banks-watch-customers-accounts-savings-information-years-data-protection-act-government-a8031501.html), [credit bureaus](https://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/credit-bureaus.html), and the [government](https://privacy.net/us-government-surveillance-spying-data-collection/). The benefits of being better informed outweigh the cost of foregoing our pretensions to privacy.
1.11.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.
1.11.4.2. Pro: Everyone who has ever had a credit card or a bank account already has made a lot of their personal information available to a portion of the public.
1.11.4.2.1. Con: Customers of banks generally have [substantial](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/08/open-banking-bank) rights of control over their account data and with whom it is shared.
1.11.4.2.2. Con: Customers of these banks consented to their information being shared by choosing that bank or specific credit card. Capitalism forces people to work to survive so they are never able to freely consent to this policy.
1.11.4.2.3. Con: Even if some people have this information they legally have to keep it private from the rest of society.
1.11.4.2.3.1. Pro: Bank [secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_secrecy) laws prevent bank employees from disclosing information with people other than the account holder.
1.11.4.2.4. Con: Just because something is, does not mean that it should be.
1.11.4.2.5. Pro: People can make approximations on someone's income based on their spending patterns \(e.g. where they live, where they shop etc.\).
1.11.4.2.5.1. Con: Even if this was the case, it would only apply to a very small subset of people with access to this information, not society as a whole.
1.11.4.2.6. Con: The proportion of the public who work at institutions which provide them with access to this data is extremely small.
1.11.4.2.6.1. Con: Credit reference agencies will provide enough data \(for a fee\) to just about anyone that asks for them. For example [Equifax](https://www.equifax.co.uk/business/all-products/en_gb) has a service offering multiple products to people for checking someone’s identity, income info about debt and so on
1.11.4.2.6.1.1. Pro: Data includes enough information to be able to make an accurate assessment/estimate of an individuals wealth
1.11.4.2.6.1.2. Con: [Substantial resources](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/dec/13/credit-reference-agency-security-data-protection) are required to carry out such checks, in terms of fees and legal representation. This policy would massively increase the availability of this private information.
1.11.4.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.11.4.2.6.1.
1.11.4.3. Con: There are [regulations](https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/privacy/yourrights/) that manage how companies and financial agencies use the personal information they may possess.
1.11.4.3.1. Con: Companies very frequently [violate](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/11/facebook-fined-for-data-breaches-in-cambridge-analytica-scandal) these regulations.
1.11.4.3.1.1. Con: Laws should not be made based on actions which violate laws. Simply because financial privacy does not always exist, does not mean that it should not exist.
1.11.4.3.1.1.1. Con: Where ineffective laws lead to selective enforcement, empowering major companies to access the data of individuals without any reciprocal transparency, there is absolutely a reason to reform them.
1.11.5. Pro: Income is viewed by many as a measure of status and success. Other information regarding one's 'success' \(e.g. their performance at work, their college grades\) are private matters; income should be the same.
1.11.6. Pro: Privacy is viewed as an important right. One reason for this is that individuals typically do not like others knowing personal information about them as they are worried about how they will be perceived and what action may come from that perception. This is true of financial information.
1.11.6.1. Con: This is true to most people. However, this should not apply to the multi-millionaires and billionaires who have consistently hidden away money from society, making life difficult for everyone else. The [Panama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers), [Paradise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Papers) and [Clearstream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearstream_affair) affairs show us only the tip of a very dangerous iceberg that destroys slowly society.
1.11.7. Pro: The government may compel you share some information with them privately to run the government, but no free human should be forced against their will to disclose information publicly.
1.11.8. Con: If people have nothing to hide, the tangible harms from a decrease in financial privacy are unclear.
1.11.8.1. Con: The government can infringe upon people's rights if it feels illegal acts are being done. Everyone has something to hide in their private life. Revelation of that information does no good to the government if the source of finances is not malicious.
1.11.9. Pro: There are numerous legitimate reasons why a person might not want others to know the amount or source of their income.
1.11.9.1. Pro: Individuals with sudden financial windfalls, such as [lottery winners](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/jackpot-lottery-identity-secret-1.4545575), may find themselves targeted by scammers or unscrupulous family members.
1.11.9.1.1. Con: This is already the case anyway, as many places [have laws](https://www.robertreeveslaw.com/blog/lottery-winners-identities/) preventing lottery winners from remaining anonymous.
1.11.9.1.1.1. Con: The existence of some current bad privacy laws should not be used to justify more. Many other countries [do](https://www.euro-millions.com/news/can-you-remain-anonymous-if-you-win-euromillions) currently allow lottery winners to remain anonymous.
1.11.9.2. Pro: Individuals with a high net worth may wish to keep this fact private for [security reasons](http://uk.businessinsider.com/knight-frank-wealth-report-high-net-worth-individuals-fears-kidnapping-2017-3), reducing their risk of kidnapping or robbery.
1.11.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.
1.11.9.3. Pro: Alimony payments could appear and give information about their previous marriage\(s\) and to whom they were married. This is information people may wish to keep private.
1.11.9.4. Pro: Someone receiving a state allowance for medical reasons \(e.g. a disability allowance\) may want to keep their medical conditions private.
1.11.9.5. Pro: Some individuals carry out [investigative work](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/mar/18/barrister-blows-whistle-on-broken-law-brought-to-its-knees-by-cuts) anonymously in order to protect their identities and preserve their access to sources of information.
1.11.9.6. Pro: Certain forms of work, such as [sex work](https://theconversation.com/the-stigma-of-sex-work-comes-with-a-high-cost-79657) or [adult entertainment](https://www.forbes.com/sites/susannahbreslin/2014/02/25/duke-porn-star/), carry social stigma. Individuals who work in these sectors have a right to anonymity.
1.11.9.7. Con: In [Norway](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-40669239), the source of people's incomes is not revealed, just their wealth, income and taxes paid.
1.11.9.8. Pro: Imagine being a millionaire \(or very rich in general\), now because your wealth is publicly available, you now have all sorts of people contacting you because they want you to donate to their cause, or imagine how much more phone sellers you would get during the day. This over years would be very annoying. Even if there was no negative effects, it's still indeed a breach on their privacy
1.11.9.9. Pro: There is stigma against people who are [long-term unemployed](https://www.businessinsider.com/stigma-against-the-long-term-unemployed-2013-4?IR=T). If income is public, people can see if they are unemployed and their main source of income is social welfare.
1.11.9.9.1. Pro: [Managers](https://www.businessinsider.com/stigma-against-the-long-term-unemployed-2013-4?IR=T) tend to hire someone who has no relevant experience rather than someone who has been unemployed for a long time.
1.11.9.9.2. Pro: Having to apply for government support programmes when unemployed can impact people's [self-confidence](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-truth-about-long-term-unemployment-in-america-2012-2?IR=T#pamela-vernocchi-has-been-unemployed-since-september-2008-1).
1.11.9.9.3. Pro: Most people believe that people if someone has failed to find a job for over a year that they are [lazy](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-truth-about-long-term-unemployment-in-america-2012-2?IR=T). They ignore the other factors affecting unemployment such as stigma from employers or a lack of jobs.
1.11.9.9.4. Con: The creation of a culture of greater financial transparency by this policy could help to defuse this stigma by encouraging frank and open conversations about financial issues.
1.11.9.9.4.1. Pro: A reduction in the levels of stigma and secrecy surrounding private financial matters might make it easier for long-term unemployed or otherwise struggling individuals to seek help.
1.12. Con: This could lead to increased pressure to redistribute wealth in a way which would not be beneficial.
1.12.1. Con: Increased pressure to redistribute wealth does not mean it will necessary lead to rapid reform. Despite the popularity of [Forbes' list](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/richest-people-in-world-forbes/), radical reforms in wealth redistribution are very uncommon.
1.12.1.1. Pro: Despite the [massive wealth](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/11/amazons-jeff-bezos-is-50-billion-richer-than-any-other-person-alive.html) of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Amazon has been continuing the [widely publicized](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-warehouse-workers-share-their-horror-stories-2018-4) [mistreatment](https://www.newsweek.com/amazon-jeff-bezos-foxconn-china-labor-echo-968691) of their [workers](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/08/amazon-jeff-bezos-unionize-working-conditions).
1.12.1.2. Con: The support for the [Sanders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/07/13/what-bernie-sanders-is-willing-to-sacrifice-for-a-more-equal-society/?utm_term=.409bc62e93e1) presidential campaign in the US was largely due to income inequality. This made it more of an electoral issue in the US.
1.12.2. Pro: Increased taxation can often result in capital flight, as wealthy people legally protect their assets. This can often be harmful as it can reduce consumption and investment within an economy.
1.12.2.1. Con: Vast majority of middle class and moderately wealthy people do not have large enough assets to make this worthwhile so will pay a higher level of taxation.
1.12.2.2. Pro: The [Panama Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers) demonstrated that wealthy people tend to move their money abroad to avoid paying tax on it.
1.12.2.3. Pro: The theory of the[Laffer Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve#Empirical_data) states that if tax rates rise too much then the actual level of income collected by governments falls due to the fact that people move their money abroad \(or engage in other practices\) to minimise their tax paid.
1.12.2.4. Pro: The economies of [Argentina and India](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalflight.asp) suffered due to capital flight.
1.12.3. Con: Income and wealth transparency could create great social pressure on the the richest through fear of embarrassment leading to increased charitable contributions and benefits for all of society.
1.12.3.1. Con: The immensely unequal distribution of global wealth is [well-documented](https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/nov/14/worlds-richest-wealth-credit-suisse), and yet this embarrassment effect has not occurred.
1.12.3.1.1. Con: The publication of information about the overall distribution of wealth is very different from the naming and shaming of individuals, which is more likely to produce a response.
1.12.3.1.1.1. Pro: Celebrities such as [Jimmy Carr](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18531008) have publicly apologised and made donations in response to revelations that they avoided tax, even though they broke no laws.
1.12.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Other individuals outed for the same behaviour, such as [Lewis Hamilton](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/06/lewis-hamilton-avoided-taxes-jet-isle-of-man-scheme-paradise-papers), have not made donations or otherwise redistributed their wealth.
1.12.4. Pro: When top producers are targeted as villains they will stop producing and everyone will suffer.
1.12.5. Pro: When exact figures are known it is more difficult to ignore the huge wage discrepancies present in the modern world.
1.12.5.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.
1.12.6. Pro: A certain degree of wealth inequality can be beneficial, as wealthy people will likely invest the money. Certain investments can be beneficial e.g. investing in a company can create jobs, investing in building real estate can provide accommodation.
1.12.6.1. Con: It would be better if the income was taxed and the state used it. A private investor will only invest in profitable endeavours rather than ones which are socially useful \(e.g. building apartments and charging a high rent rather than building social housing\). Comparatively, the state has a duty of care to its citizens so will likely engage in more socially useful projects.
1.12.6.1.1. Con: States are regularly massively [wasteful](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10626565/TaxPayers-Alliance-warns-of-120billion-government-waste.html) with taxpayer money.
1.12.7. Con: Redistributing wealth, or at least addressing unethical income disparities, would be beneficial to society as a whole.
1.12.7.1. Con: According to [public choice theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice), which argues that economic self-interest is the driving force of politics, redistribution tends to benefit those with the power to set spending priorities more than it helps those in need.
1.12.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.2.
1.12.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.
