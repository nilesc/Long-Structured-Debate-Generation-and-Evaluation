Discussion Title: Should the Primary Focus of Prisons be Rehabilitation, or Punishment?

1. The primary focus of prisons should be rehabilitation and reintegration, not punishment.
1.1. Pro: People who commit crimes are often not entirely to blame for doing so. In recognition of this, prison systems should be structured around supporting inmates so that they do not commit crimes again.
1.1.1. Pro: Punishment-focused prison systems are rooted in historic Christian concepts of 'justice', moral culpability, and libertarian free will; this seems incompatible with the modern scientific view that human actions are fully determined by biology and environment.
1.1.1.1. Con: The ape instinct to seek retribution for wrongs is evolution's answer to the "prisoner's dilemma" structure of primate social relations. Christian societies justify this instinct with the language of "just deserts." Regardless of whether that language is valid, seeking retribution remains a successful and perhaps necessary strategy to promote social cooperation.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Retribution can lead to spirals of violence as in the infamous [feud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield%E2%80%93McCoy_feud) between the Hatfields and McCoys.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: The instinct to seek retribution is an inefficient evolutionary shortcut and makes most sense under conditions of anarchy. Because we understand the basic game theoretic problem \(the "prisoner's dilemma"\) and the nuances of human psychology, we can design more effective and efficient responses to antisocial behavior.
1.1.2. Pro: In an imperfect system - where there are wrongful convictions, where some laws cause more harm than good, where certain groups are disproportionately incarcerated - rehabilitation has less potential for harm, while providing discouragement to those who have genuinely harmed others.
1.1.2.1. Pro: [Racism and class issues](http://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/color-of-justice-racial-and-ethnic-disparity-in-state-prisons/) in the criminal justice system mean some groups are overrepresented in prisons, not because they are more criminal but because they are more likely to be arrested and/or more likely to be convicted due to poor legal defense or unconscious bias.
1.1.3. Pro: There are a number of interlinking factors that can cause someone to commit a crime. A primary concern with simply punishing an individual is there is nothing being done to solve the motivation behind the crime. There are a range of dynamic factors \(such as drug misuse, employment\) that are changeable, through dealing with these issues there is a reduced risk of re-offending. Which is beneficial to the individuals and society.
1.1.4. Con: Even if there are mitigating circumstances that contribute to a person committing a crime, they are still in most instances aware of what they are doing and should take responsibility for those actions.
1.1.5. Pro: A baby can develop into a constructive or a destructive member of the society. It is the society itself that determines which way it goes. If the society has created a criminal it is highly unfair to punish the criminal. Society has to be such that cooperation and empathy are stronger than competition and aggression. Societies need to encourage critically thinking children and adults that support the common good. So that children feel free and have no urge to become destructive.
1.1.6. Con: Focusing on rehabilitation implies that criminals are merely victims of circumstance. If they just need external forces to make them better, then their crimes were really the result of negative external forces, not their own free will. This encourages potential criminals to blame others and say they can't help it. Focusing on punishment implies that people always have a choice and can choose to do what's right.
1.1.7. Pro: A compassionate society, which means we are able to show love to ourselves and others, must remember that most criminals are made, not born, through sometimes hideous abuse and neglect. [85%](http://www.begintoread.com/research/literacystatistics.html) of children who interface with the juvenile justice system are illiterate.
1.1.8. Pro: Those who have committed criminal acts have generally been programmed by an environment with a different value system to those of mainstream society. Poverty and poor education is largely responsible for the existence of this environment and subculture. In order to be rehabilitated, offenders require to be equipped with the skills that will allow them to be able to participate with self-respect and without stigma in mainstream society.
1.1.9. Pro: While individuals are technically responsible for their crimes, a large proportion of crime is a direct consequence of [societal problems](http://open.lib.umn.edu/socialproblems/chapter/8-4-explaining-crime/). Rehabilitation can address the longer-term societal issues that inspired the crime; punishment only satisfies a short-term desire for vengeance.
1.1.9.1. Con: Punishment is what is 'just' for those who wrong society through criminal conduct.
1.1.9.1.1. Pro: A system which does not punish for violation of rights does not promote the value of those rights.
1.1.9.1.1.1. Con: Violence can't be solved by violence.
1.1.9.1.1.2. Con: There is no reason to believe this.
1.1.9.1.1.2.1. Pro: It could be argued that a system whose goal in the face of an infraction of rights is to correct the imbalance is upholding their ideals more than one that merely quarantines the offender.
1.1.9.1.1.2.2. Con: In a world without consequences there will be much more crime; there will be established the [law of the jungle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_jungle) rather than a modern societal understanding of law and justice.
1.1.9.1.1.3. Pro: Stealing a penny is irrelevant, and the victim will not care. Stealing and murdering a child, the victim will demand punishment. The distinction is in the value of the stolen item, whilst the underlying issue remains: whether it is right to demand justice in the form of punishment, or reformation.
1.1.9.1.1.4. Con: The thesis is not saying "don't punish criminals". It is only saying that punishment is secondary to rehabilitation. Thus, the system is still advocating punishment, and consequently promoting the value of rights.
1.1.9.1.1.4.1. Pro: Imprisonment and rehabilitation are not mutually exclusive.
1.1.9.1.1.5. Con: The value of rights is promoted through the prevention of their violation. Punishment - at least as the term is usually used in this context - is about giving wrongdoers 'what they deserve'. This is essentially a sort of unnatural karma system and has nothing to do with protecting anyone's rights.
1.1.9.1.1.6. Con: This creates a theoretical paradox where one of the key rights society cherishes is freedom. Imprisoning someone \(and therefore removing their rights\) does not reinforce a value of rights, but rather illustrates that certain rights are mutable. This is augmented by the constant changing of laws in any given country. If anything, removing someone's rights through imprisonment devalues the concept of rights and further damages society.
1.1.9.1.2. Pro: Punishment should be the primary focus of prisons because criminal acts must have consequences to be effective.
1.1.9.1.2.1. Pro: The notion relies on the idea of 'just deserts': justice must be done \(ie punishment must be meted out\) and seen to be done \(i.e punishment should apply to all\) \([McShane](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=jRvaAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=The+notion+relies+on+the+idea+of+%27just+deserts%27:+justice+must+be+done+and+seen+to+be+done.&source=bl&ots=h4oZTRn8Cm&sig=_VPJL3hjjNfkHXhCSPU6aueDymg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiFwYjOlIbXAhWFsJQKHTg8BD4Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=The%20notion%20relies%20on%20the%20idea%20of%20'just%20deserts'%3A%20justice%20must%20be%20done%20and%20seen%20to%20be%20done.&f=false), pg 29\).
1.1.9.1.2.2. Con: The consequence here would be the act of imprisonment so the criminal is already punished so additional punishment would simply be a form of revenge.
1.1.9.1.2.3. Pro: A punishment system is based on the fact that humans have free will. Acting as though all criminals are victims of circumstance removes the idea that people should be culpable for their actions and promotes irresponsible decision-making.
1.1.9.1.2.3.1. Pro: Actions have consequences. Rehabilitation should be a goal for the penal system, but subservient to punishment: blindly treating all criminals as victims of society strips the actual victims of their right to justice. Realities of upbringing and social disadvantage do explain crimes, but they simply don't excuse them.
1.1.9.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: For the most serious crimes \(murder, rape\) rehabilitation should be a distant second priority to punishment only coming into consideration after the culprit has paid \(indeed, suffered\) for their actions.
1.1.9.1.2.3.2. Con: Punishing them reinforces the idea that people are animals that need to be beaten into compliance, that they are incapable of learning, only of being trained.
1.1.9.1.2.3.3. Con: Just because people are responsible for their actions does not mean it's okay to inflict punishment that leads to suffering.
1.1.9.1.2.3.4. Con: Nobody is claiming they are just victims of circumstances.
1.1.9.1.2.3.5. Pro: This view corresponds with the [classical theory of criminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_school_\(criminology\)) which focuses on individual rights, the capacity to make rational choices and the need for punishment in response to crime as a deterrence.
1.1.9.1.2.4. Con: Criminal actions result in the punishment of being removed from society. Going through focused rehabilitation while incarcerated prepare them for reentering society upon completion of their incarceration. Being rehabilitated while removed from society is still punishment.
1.1.9.1.2.4.1. Pro: Criminals are punished by the act of being imprisoned. The removal of one's liberty is the punishment; there is no need to add anything further.
1.1.9.1.2.5. Pro: Rehabilitation does not always work to reduce criminal behaviour in certain individuals, however punishment is proven to be effective.
1.1.9.1.2.5.1. Con: There is nothing to suggest that rehabilitation, in itself, is not a form of punishment. Time spent away from family and friends, in an intensive treatment program, with other inmates, until a licensed psychiatric professional deems someone to have been rehabilitated for a period of time could be argued as both rehabilitative and punitive.
1.1.9.1.2.5.1.1. Con: While rehabilitation can have punishment like results, it is the focus. Someone that goes away to college to improve their life may also have similar results. The difference is between you choosing it or it being forced on you.
1.1.9.1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: There is a vast difference between being forced in a cell up to 23 hours a day and a college student who's away from family. The two are uncomparable in context.
1.1.9.1.2.5.1.2. Con: Many times, the criminal's friends are already in prison or will soon join them. People befriend similar personalities to their own. As a result, rehabilitation cannot be a form of punishment, but a rewarding vacation-time.
1.1.9.1.2.5.2. Con: Having some cases where rehabilitation is impossible doesn't mean that the overall primary focus of the prison system shouldn't be rehabilitation.
1.1.9.1.2.5.3. Con: Nothing works all of the time, but there is still value in trying to do things that may have favourable outcomes.
1.1.9.1.2.5.4. Pro: Many unfortunate or disenfranchised individuals do not actually need rehabilitation, and attempting to rehabilitate them would be a futile effort.
1.1.9.1.2.5.4.1. Con: If criminals did not require rehabilitation they would not be criminals in the first place. The very fact they have broken the law means they have fallen out of society and require rehabilitation to get back in.
1.1.9.1.2.5.5. Pro: If we assume that rehabilitation of a criminal is impossible, this doesn't mean they shouldn't be imprisoned. Thus, imprisonment can conceivably be done for reasons other than rehabilitation, e.g. retribution or deterrence.
1.1.9.1.2.5.5.1. Con: We cannot know the efficacy of rehabilitation until we try, and the potential reward for succeeding is such that it makes more sense to try than not.
1.1.9.1.2.5.6. Pro: Prisons should keep punishment as their main focus, but should have the option of rehabilitation for inmates who demonstrate promise and not just to all by default.
1.1.9.1.2.5.6.1. Con: There is a fundamental flaw in the idea of using punishment as a strategy to reduce or prevent crime which can be found upon examining its actual effects. It has been [proven](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-15997-001) that using punishment only motivates the subject to avoid the source of the punishment, not change the tendency to engage in the behaviour that was punished. The result is a change in the manner by which crime is committed, becoming more careful and strategic.
1.1.9.1.2.5.6.2. Con: This is highly subjective and could be abused in racist or political ways.
1.1.9.1.2.5.6.2.1. Con: Arguably so could rehabilitation. Corrections could be delayed and replaced with a more punishing demeanor due to race or ethnicity or politics. However, this does not mean that this will absolutely happen and is most likely just a fallacy.
1.1.9.1.2.5.6.2.2. Con: Just because something can be abused doesn't mean that it will or that steps can't be taken to guarantee it won't be abused.
1.1.9.1.2.5.6.2.2.1. Con: This argument put obtuse amounts of faith in the fact that human beings will act rationally and objectively in all situations, even those situations where regulatory devices are being constructed.
1.1.9.1.2.5.6.2.2.2. Con: [Abuse of power](http://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/color-of-justice-racial-and-ethnic-disparity-in-state-prisons/) is [rampant](http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/sites/default/files/contentgroups/sasp/poster_gallery/pg35.pdf) in the [prison system](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/03/29/why-some-prisoners-with-hiv-get-better-treatment-than-others), even with rules in place to prevent it. There is no reason to assume that rehabilitation would be different.
1.1.9.1.2.5.6.2.2.2.1. Con: Retributive justice will always entail abuse of power because it feeds off of our desires to punish people \(and punish harshly\). In contrast, because rehabilitative justice is not based in the idea that we should harm other people, but instead help them, there are far fewer opportunities for abuses of power.
1.1.9.1.2.5.6.2.2.2.2. Con: A general focus on rehabilitation would encourage more social workers and other professionals to work in prisons. If these people are well-trained, this has the potential to reduce the risk of abuse.
1.1.9.1.2.5.6.2.2.2.2.1. Con: This would only work if the training is adequate. According to [this study](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/63191/900718-Prisoner-Abuse-Is-Avoidable.pdf), "Another ticket to abuse is reliance on administrators and troops largely untrained in prison management."
1.1.9.1.2.5.6.2.2.2.2.2. Pro: Prisons can be changed into rehabilitation centres because society shapes the way prisons are organised. In fact, some cultures emulate normal society in an attempt to rehabilitate convicted criminals. Rather than isolate criminals as punishment by locking them in a cell, convicts are required to have a daily routine and a job. They are only isolated from the rest of society to maintain focus and discipline - not to inflict punishment: [The Norwegian prison where inmates are treated like people](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/25/norwegian-prison-inmates-treated-like-people?CMP=share_btn_link).
1.1.9.1.2.5.6.2.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: Prison staff can form a milieu of professional "rehabilitators", with practical experience and expertise in pedagogy, psychology and dynamic security. Thus, they provide better rehabilitation than if they weren't all in one place with the convicts.
1.1.9.1.2.5.7. Pro: Some individuals who end up in prison have a mindset that is unchanging. Rehabilitation will only work with some of the inmates. Bad people will do bad things without feeling sorry for their actions. Individuals susceptible to rehabilitation should be screened for in prison populations as not all prisoners will be willing to change.
1.1.9.1.2.5.7.1. Pro: Rehabilitation does not work without understanding and application of consequence/punishment.
1.1.9.1.2.5.7.2. Con: It depends when you start rehabilitation. You can still be receptive of help in changing your behavior without feeling sorry for your actions. When a criminal weighs risk vs reward, it's about the immediate "need" being met.
1.1.9.1.2.6. Pro: Punishment is the part of incarceration that gives the rest of society a sense of justice and without it people may lose faith in the justice system. If there is no punishment focus for something like tax evasion for instance, then they ones who pay may lose confidence in their own payments being for the common good.
1.1.9.1.3. Pro: Criminal justice systems should prioritize a victim's right to retribution in the form of punishment.
1.1.9.1.3.1. Pro: Punishing criminals partially serves to make friends and families of their victims feel better.
1.1.9.1.3.1.1. Pro: It would not have been just to the victim of the crimes committed to know that the perpetrator had not been punished. Rehabilitation can reach a limit, but pain and suffering of the victim may not. The justice system first and foremost should not fail the victims, and secondly, ensure the people released from confinement will not be a further threat to the society, for which stronger punishment would have been an effective path as well.
1.1.9.1.3.1.1.1. Con: [Some research](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00677624/document) suggests that the victim is satisfied if the offender signals that they understands why punishment/revenge was imposed upon them, rather than if they see the offender being punished.
1.1.9.1.3.1.2. Con: This claim assumes all crimes have a victim; this is untrue.
1.1.9.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Many crimes do not have victims, an estimated [80% or more of federal prisoners](https://mic.com/articles/8558/why-we-need-prison-reform-victimless-crimes-are-86-of-the-federal-prison-population#.dfrtMe0Vn) are convicted for crimes that had no 'victim'. Over 3,000 are serving life without parole [for non-violent crimes.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/13/us-prisoners-sentences-life-non-violent-crimes)
1.1.9.1.3.1.2.2. Con: Crimes such as drug offences are a type of vice crime. As drugs cause health problems to individuals, some may argue that there is a direct victim. There are also indirect victims as drug use increases domestic violence, organised crime and reduces the productivity of the drug user to the community.
1.1.9.1.3.1.3. Con: Some victims might be horrified at the perpetuation of suffering, in their name and for their benefit, so this action might actually make them feel worse; an example is a woman who pleaded for her father's murderer to [not be executed](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/27/dear-governor-please-dont-execute-kennth-williams).
1.1.9.1.3.1.4. Con: The justice system is not meant to cater to the wishes of victims.
1.1.9.1.3.1.4.1. Pro: Under a different model, therapy could help both victims and perpetrators feel better, and it can be argued that this approach would provide greater long-term benefit than retribution.
1.1.9.1.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: New schemes that put offenders and victims together, to meet and talk as part of a rehabilitative process, have proven [extremely helpful](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-criminals-and-victims-meet-both-parties-can-benefit/) for both parties.
1.1.9.1.3.1.4.1.2. Pro: The state is not incentivized to assist victims of crimes. Prosecutors and police are pushed to rack up convictions, but no one is looking out for victims' needs. Punishment for the victims' sake is a cop out without a sincere effort to help victims.
1.1.9.1.3.1.4.1.2.1. Con: [The state does help victims ​](http://victimsofcrime.org/help-for-crime-victims/get-help-bulletins-for-crime-victims/crime-victim-compensation)
1.1.9.1.3.1.4.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.3.1.3.
1.1.9.1.3.1.4.2. Con: Punishment for the sake of doing what is just to wrongdoers has nothing to do with catering to the wishes of victims.
1.1.9.1.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: This rationale applies equally well to victimless crimes.
1.1.9.1.3.1.5. Con: Retribution continues inflicting harm. It may even lead to retribution for the act of retribution etc. Ending the cycle before it starts is a sensible position of non-violence.
1.1.9.1.3.1.5.1. Pro: Punishing others to make yourself feel good violates Immanuel Kant's[philosophy of Human Dignity](https://kantphilosophy.wordpress.com/kants-ethics/the-good-will/): it is a type of sadism, and certainly doesn't come from good will.
1.1.9.1.3.1.5.2. Pro: History offers examples of seemingly endless cycles of retribution, e.g. [Hatfields and McCoys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield%E2%80%93McCoy_feud).
1.1.9.1.3.1.5.3. Pro: Literary classics explore the destructive consequences of retribution, e.g. the [Montagues and Capulets feud](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/romeo_juliet/full.html).
1.1.9.1.3.1.6. Con: Under the view of utilitarianism, it is hard to argue that the happiness experienced by the victim overshadows the harm to the criminal.
1.1.9.1.3.1.6.1. Pro: The rights of a perpetrator are not overshadowed by people who desire vengeance.
1.1.9.1.3.1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.3.1.1.1.
1.1.9.1.3.1.6.3. Pro: The victims might get some degree of happiness, or feel able to move on from their experience, if the criminal is punished; however, they also may not. Mistreatment of a prisoner, conversely, will undoubtedly create a good deal of unhappiness.
1.1.9.1.3.1.7. Con: There are cases where there are no friends or family to survive the victim, in which case, retribution to make them feel better is redundant.
1.1.9.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.3.1.2.
1.1.9.1.3.3. Pro: If society feels that justice is not being done, it will result in vigilantism and ill-feeling in the community.
1.1.9.1.3.3.1. Pro: For violent crimes \(particularly homicide\), many victims are going to want the perpetrator to be punished. If the state refuses to do it, they'll do it themselves. The resulting cycles of violence can seriously erode the [state's monopoly on force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_as_a_Vocation). That monopoly is probably the single most important development for the reduction of violence in human societies, as has been argued by Thomas Hobbes in [Leviathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_\(Hobbes_book\)) and Jean Bodin in [The Six Books of the Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Bodin#Les_Six_livres_de_la_R%C3%A9publique_\(The_Six_Books_of_the_Republic\)).
1.1.9.1.3.3.1.1. Con: It is not the state but the people who hold this power. [journals.sagepub.com](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002200202236166?journalCode=jcrb)
1.1.9.1.3.3.2. Con: Even though there are [many](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/finance/309544-why-have-no-ceos-been-punished-for-the-financial-crisis) [cases](http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/10/16/john_oliver_on_equifax_data_breaches.html) where the society at large agrees that injustice has occurred, vigilantism doesn't manifest to set the record straight.
1.1.9.1.3.3.3. Con: Justice is a subjective, mutable and unquantifiable concept which is unique to each individual and circumstance. It should not be used as a means of satisfying the desire for vengeance of emotionally distressed victims whose judgement is unbalanced and distorted. A lack of ability to forgive even the most minor crimes largely drives a desire for harsh punishment. That strongly militates against the ability to apply any measured and fair sense of justice.
1.1.9.1.3.3.4. Con: Justice is being served as the offender would theoretically be significantly less likely to commit another crime in the future. Our societal definition of justice would have to be tweaked.
1.1.9.1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.4.1.
1.1.9.1.3.5. Con: This is a philosophically fraught statement that contradicts a lot of understood ideas.
1.1.9.1.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.3.1.5.1.
1.1.9.1.3.5.2. Pro: Free will is a philosophically and scientifically defective concept and to hinge the justice system on a victim's "right" to retribution for an act committed by a non-autonomous agent \(as we all are\) is a grotesque and unproductive inversion of priorities.
1.1.9.1.3.5.3. Pro: Violence carries inertia to it. If a victim is victimized, the worst they can do is perpetuate the violence they inherited. The best thing society can do is rehabilitate both the criminal and the victim. This parent comment is a philosophical flaw.
1.1.9.1.3.6. Pro: While the idea of rehabilitation and social re/integration should be taken into consideration, prisons should also be about giving the victims and their relatives a sense of justice, maybe fairness, rather than a feeling of impunity.
1.1.9.1.3.7. Con: Retribution has no value in improving society. The drive to make others suffer for the suffering they've caused is animalistic and irrational, and is also not a universal desire.
1.1.9.1.3.7.1. Pro: Punishment needs to be balanced against the positive or negative effects a punishment has on society.
1.1.9.1.3.7.2. Pro: Victims of crime may care more about whether the offender will victimize others in the future.
1.1.9.1.3.7.3. Pro: A lot of victims would rather have compensation \(such as monetary compensation\) from the offender than retribution. Prison does not provide compensation to the victim.
1.1.9.1.3.7.3.1. Con: People resorting to crimes such as stealing often do not have much money to start with, making it unlikely that they would be able to pay for more than the value of what they stole, if even that.
1.1.9.1.3.7.3.2. Con: Accepting compensation instead of demanding punishment is antisocial, because it effectively allows wealthy individuals to buy their way out of the justice system. Retribution is altruistic because individuals and/or the state spend effort to promote just laws and public safety generally. Compensation turns its recipient and the original criminal into co-conspirators against the rest of society.
1.1.9.1.3.7.4. Pro: The ultimate goal of society should be to statistically lower criminality to avoid others from suffering from further crimes, even if it means having no retribution.
1.1.9.1.3.8. Pro: It's necessary to show respect to the victim as a government to make sure that the pain or death of him or her wasn't without any serious consequences
1.1.9.1.3.9. Pro: Punishment should be equal to and greater than the value of which was violated against. Time served is of little consolation to those victimized.
1.1.9.1.3.9.1. Con: This is not borne out by the available data. Most victims and their survivors prefer for perpetrators to serve long sentences in prison rather than suffer the death penalty because prisons are extremely punishing: [Revenge is not Justice](https://www.aclunc.org/sites/default/files/voices_from_california_crime_victims_for_alternatives_to_the_death_penalty.pdf)
1.1.9.1.3.9.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.3.1.3.
1.1.9.1.4. Con: No clear reason is presented here why, assuming criminals deserve to be punished, achieving that goal should take priority over other course of action.
1.1.9.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.3.1.4.
1.1.9.1.6. Pro: Rehabilitation is a productivist way of thinking, based on the idea of normativity. As it is thought to use the prison to destroy the old subject and to create a new more integrated one, it's the most dictatorial policy. Imprisonment for punishment is just a kind of temporary banishment.
1.1.9.1.6.1. Con: One can ignore 'normativity', and instead define appropriate behavior deductively, as the law does: law's only describe 'bad' behavior.
Hence, the goal and definition of rehabilitation can simply be the removal of undesirable/antisocial behavior \(as opposed to the attainment of some norm\).
This is the opposite of dictatorial. This is an attempt to re-include the accused into society.
1.1.9.1.7. Pro: We should treat criminals as people who chose antisocial behaviour of their own free will, instead of regarding them as somehow defective and in need of treatment.
1.1.9.1.7.1. Con: Rehabilitation isn't just psychiatric treatment. It can be addiction treatment, work-release plans, and other things that help bring people back into society.
1.1.9.1.7.2. Pro: Rehabilitation programs can make it look like it is society's fault for alienating the criminal in the first place, and therefore society's duty to bring him back into the fold.
1.1.9.1.7.2.1. Con: When society can choose between different rehabilitation programs and picks the one that ceteris paribus alienates the criminal then this is the wrong choice. It's the fault of society who chose wrong.
1.1.9.1.7.2.2. Con: This is a red herring. It does not matter whose fault it is, nor whose duty it is to remedy. There exists a problem - criminality - and a pair of proposed solutions: prison or rehabilitation. The concepts of fault and duty are of no use whatsoever in selecting the optimal remedy.
1.1.9.1.7.2.2.1. Con: If it is society's fault, then the criminal has no duty to change: he has to be enticed to change, and has every right to feel irritated by society making him jump through hoops.
On the other hand, if it is the criminal who is at fault and is judged by society, this puts the duty to remedy the situation on him, where it belongs.
1.1.9.1.7.3. Pro: The "treatment" approach logically leads to keeping criminals locked up until they have been reformed. Potentially, it could be used to justify brain-washing the criminal in order to purge the criminal impulses.
1.1.9.1.7.3.1. Con: Brainwashing a criminal to prevent criminal impulses would result in lower crime rates and be a net positive for everyone.
1.1.9.1.7.3.1.1. Con: There are limits as to what is morally permissible in the fight against anti-social behavior. Punishment is just retribution for the damage the perpetrator caused, which respects their humanity even when the punishment is death. Brainwashing dehumanizes the subject by meddling with their psyche against their will, and is therefore unacceptable.
1.1.9.1.7.4. Con: Though people are free to make decisions with regard to their behavior, they may be limited in terms of realistic options. Rehabilitation would give offenders the options they may have lacked in the outside world.
1.1.9.1.7.4.1. Con: Choosing behavior that is anti-social enough to warrant a prison sentence ought not be relativized by suggesting that there were no "realistic" alternatives. Of course criminals view their behavior as in their best interest and as justified - that is precisely why they have to be judged and punished in order to demonstrate that it was not.
1.1.9.1.7.4.1.1. Con: Rehabilitation also demonstrates that the behavior is not in their best interests. The difference is that rehabilitation has been shown to reduce recidivism of the bad behaviors more than punishment does.
1.1.9.1.7.5. Con: This is a false dichotomy. Criminals can enact their own free will whilst at the same time being socially defective and in need of treatment.
1.1.9.1.7.5.1. Con: "Free will" means that if a person acts in an anti-social way, that person has voluntarily chosen wrongdoing. This is not compatible with the view that their decision-making faculties are damaged and in need of repair. In the latter view, there is no free will involved, as choices are made by the deterministic program running in the brain, which is deemed defective and has to be rewritten.
1.1.9.1.7.5.1.1. Con: Anti-social behaviour is not necessarily evil.
1.1.9.1.7.5.1.2. Con: It is a non sequitur to state that "there is no free will involved... \[in someone whose\] decision-making faculties are damaged".
1.1.9.1.7.6. Con: This ignores systemic/cyclical issues that influence behavior and completely dismisses any instances of mental health disorders causing deviant actions.
1.1.9.1.7.6.1. Con: There is no way to distinguish between a behaviour being pathological - caused from a mental health disorder - or being motivated by cruelty or selfishness. Malevolence can be categorised as 'mental disorders', but that is unhelpful; unless there is a physical cause, like a brain tumour, treating it as a medical or pathological issue is the wrong way to approach it.
1.1.9.1.8. Con: Society shouldn't care what is just, because this is a subjective term. It should care about improving objective metrics like increasing global happiness and productivity or reducing future criminal conduct.
1.1.9.1.8.1. Con: -> See discussion #2649: Morality is objective.
1.1.9.1.9. Con: There's no consensus over what is just.
1.1.9.1.9.1. Con: The fact that people disagree over what is just does not imply that there is not an objective fact of the matter concerning what is just.
1.1.9.1.10. Con: Considering the degenerate state of prisons around the world, putting people in them is often an exaggerated punishment.
1.1.9.1.10.1. Con: That’s an argument to reform the prison system, not to abolish using prisons to punish wrongdoers for the sake of justice.
1.1.9.2. Pro: Crimes are often committed by people who have traumatic or violent experience when they were children. In other cases crime is committed due to ignorance and belief that this is the way of doing things based on their culture. A rehabilitation based on awareness, explaining the reason they shouldn't have to commit a crime would help better than just putting behind bars, with the effect of creating a network of criminals within the prison system.
1.1.9.3. Con: It is not clear that it is exclusively societal problems that cause crimes. Crimes could also be the result of a propensity by some individuals to commit crime.
1.1.9.3.1. Pro: Individuals subjected to the same environment clearly engage in diverse activities. Crime is no exception.
1.1.9.3.2. Con: The crime rate is likely composed of \(at least\) two parts: crime due to societal problems, and some "steady state" rate at which humans will commit crime in each situation.
1.1.9.3.3. Con: This "propensity" could be treated as a mental illness, and treated as such. Then all crimes would be the result of either societal conditions or mental illness. Treating mental illness and fixing these societal problems would therefore eliminate crime.
1.1.9.4. Con: Satisfying the desire for revenge, by imprisoning criminals, may be justified, because otherwise the victims may take revenge themselves in more cruel ways.
1.1.9.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.3.
1.1.9.4.2. Con: Revenge is an ultimately harmful human desire, and society should not be built around perpetuating it.
1.1.9.5. Con: Focusing on rehabilitation of the criminals doesn't really affect the societal problem that generated the crime. The societal problem can be ignored regardless of whether the focus is on rehabilitation or punishment.
1.1.9.5.1. Con: Many of the societal problems are cyclical in nature, with the prison system as part of the cycle: for example, imprisoned people have trouble getting jobs, making them more likely to live in poverty, making their children live in poverty, making it more likely that their children will commit similar crimes.
1.1.9.5.1.1. Pro: Punishment is experienced twice in the current system. The first is during their sentence, the second is after their release: currently, you are required to list any convictions, and time served, on job and housing applications. The likelihood of gaining work and shelter is severely curtailed, which vastly increases the possibility of re-offending.
1.1.9.5.1.1.1. Pro: A good solution would be to avoid sending those convicted of non-violent crimes to prison, but instead to a community centre for rehabilitation. With this they can perform community-based work for which they would be paid a minimum wage, given to them upon release to probation in order to help defer the cost of living. The current system simply does not work, and promotes re-offending.
1.1.9.5.1.1.2. Pro: Locking people up for minor offences, like drug possession, won't help. If individuals enter prison addicted to drugs and with no skills, they will leave prison with no skills and a [potentially worse](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/03/11/prisons-are-making-americas-drug-problem-worse) drug problem. In the long run it is more efficient to provide rehabilitation than punishment, to hopefully lessen the re-offence rates.
1.1.9.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Habits and their sustainability are influenced by the environment people are in. Someone in an unsupportive environment will find it more difficult to develop or maintain a habit than someone in a supportive one. For example, someone living with regular drug users will probably find it harder to cut down or stop drug use than someone who is the only drug user in their household.
1.1.9.6. Pro: This posit may be true, but a serious concern is that blaming 'societal problems' is too nebulous, and does not inspire a necessary sense of responsibility for one's actions.
1.1.9.7. Con: Societal problems are responsible for the root cause of all crime. If there were true equality of opportunity, resources, etc, there would be no need for or drive towards crime.
1.1.9.7.1. Pro: Current social models in the US were built in the white, dominant, patriarchy of America. '[Redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining)' practises, for example, have been built into the fabric of US economics, limiting blacks and other minorities based on ethnic composition.
1.1.10. Pro: No human being is born evil, or chooses to be what society deems "evil." It is a consequence of bad upbringing and/or traumas and/or being part of a unlawful society. As seen in a couple of European countries, focusing on rehabilitation and reintegration can and will make most prisoners better humans and more fit members of society.
1.1.10.1. Con: Science suggests that humans do not have free will: we are simply making choices based on the accumulation of physical laws which have resulted in our current state. Criminal behaviour may be due to physical circumstance - for example, a man whose brain tumour caused him to [develop paedophilia](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/a-40-year-old-developed-an-obsession-with-child-pornography-then-doctors-discovered-why-a6893756.html) - in which case, neither punishment nor rehabilitation would help unduly.
1.1.10.1.1. Pro: People with a variant of the gene, called MAOA-L, produce less of the protein that breaks down signalling chemicals, which in turn causes them to build up. An excess of these chemicals, [scientists believe](http://www.businessinsider.com/psychopath-gene-2015-7), leads to impulsive behavior \(including hypersexuality, sleep disorders, mood swings, and violent tendencies\).
1.1.10.1.2. Pro: There is [scientific evidence](http://www.nature.com/news/brain-scans-predict-which-criminals-are-more-likely-to-reoffend-1.12672) \(gained through brain imaging\) that certain kinds of criminals often suffer from brain abnormalities.
1.1.10.2. Pro: Often, criminals are a [product of trauma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3386595/) \(childhood abuse, poverty, etc\). Rehabilitation can give trauma survivors access to resources that allow them to address and move on from their trauma, and move forward with their lives as healthy contributing members of society.
1.1.10.2.1. Pro: Further, the people helping them would gain a lot of knowledge that could be used to prevent criminal activities by addressing the root issues.
1.1.10.3. Con: There may be a relationship to bad parenting, trauma, etc. but it is not a causal relationship. Not every person who had a rough childhood, trauma, etc. becomes a criminal, so the criminal ultimately makes a choice. They are, and must be, responsible for the choice to commit crime.
1.1.10.4. Pro: [Normative moral relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism#Normative) holds that because nobody is right or wrong, we ought to tolerate the behavior of others even when we disagree about the morality of it.
1.1.10.5. Pro: [Meta-ethical moral relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism#Meta-ethical) holds that  when people disagree about what is moral, nobody is objectively right or wrong.
1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.
1.3. Pro: Prioritising rehabilitation is best for the community.
1.3.1. Pro: As the prisoner will re-enter the community upon completion of their sentence, it is necessary to focus on the holistic rehabilitation of the individual.
1.3.1.1. Con: [Halfway houses are producing mixed results.](http://www.macrothink.org/journal/index.php/jsr/article/viewFile/8038/6617) We do see improvement on parole completion rates, but not on long term recidivism.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Treating criminal behaviour as symptomatic of deeper issues, and working to solve those issues, is paramount both for individuals and wider society.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Stripping them of freedom and temporarily removing them from society is punishment enough. During this time, they should be treated as human beings who are dangerous yet in need of serious help if we expect them to eventually rejoin society.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: The main purpose of the US prison system is to house prisoners for long periods of time. Time is the punishment. Unfortunately about 80% of the US prison population are people who use drugs. Many of those drug users use drugs to self medicate. The best "rehabilitation" that could be improved upon in the US system is better mental health evaluations and treatment plans that extend beyond prison. Better halfway houses, better jobs, and relocation would be a big blow to recidivism as well.
1.3.1.2.3. Pro: If you deal with a person and their 'criminal' problem as if you would with someone with an issue of mental health, with support and guidance, they can 'get better'.
1.3.1.3. Pro: The current systems used in prisons are dysfunctional and detrimental to all involved.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: If you really want to help the world help its people become better citizens, not better criminals.  There's too much time being spent in prison working out and working meaningless jobs that only help the prison industrial complex save or make money. The whole system needs an overhaul.
1.3.1.3.2. Pro: With the exception of those who need to be removed from society for society's safety, the only time offenders should be 'removed from society' is for rehabilitation, and they should then be reintegrated as quickly as possible. Current systems - which include constant monitoring and parole conditions - remove total freedom from released offenders, which is detrimental to reintegration.
1.3.1.3.2.1. Con: This claim recognizes by its first sentence that keeping society safe is the top-priority of prisons, not rehabilitation.
1.3.1.3.2.2. Pro: Deterrence can be achieved through community service that benefits society, rather than imprisonment, which costs society more than it gains.
1.3.1.3.3. Pro: If we truly believe in 'paying one's debt to society' then we must prepare those we incarcerate to rejoin that society. Having one's voting privileges permanently removed or the record of incarceration forever subject to employment applications hardly serves that purpose. A return to society demands the socialising of inmates, including education, exposure to the arts and a long list of societal tools: that should be the primary purpose of imprisonment.
1.3.1.3.4. Pro: If left alone, given the terrible mix of people living within prisons, the society they construct for themselves can worsen the criminals' general social compatibility. This creates a criminal subculture more dangerous than before.
1.3.1.3.4.1. Pro: [In Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief_in_law) the mafia "protects" inmates when pledging a life at juxtaposition to the general public.
1.3.1.3.5. Pro: The current system, which rests on spite or revenge, is not a sensible basis for policy. If prison is solely supposed to be revenge then you can expect more problems in the future, while preventing someone from becoming a career criminal is better for society and better for that individual. If someone cannot be rehabilitated \(tried and failed or via regulated assessment\) then separation from society is the only choice, but this is a last option.
1.3.1.4. Pro: Rehabilitation is the safest option for wider society.
1.3.1.4.1. Pro: A prison system with the main goal of rehabilitation is safer. Criminals who come out of prison with somewhere to go other than their old ways are less likely to pose a threat to society. A harsh and cruel sentence will only further alienate them from the police and the law.  We should base our system around who we would want these people to be when they get out, as they will become our neighbours.
1.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: Purely punitive measures do not engender respect either of self or community, but rather build barriers and further alienate integration. Restorative justice, education and promotion of mutual and social responsibility offer opportunities for convicts to re-integrate and become responsible members of society.
1.3.1.4.1.2. Pro: Punishment is a synonym of martyr in this specific case. Prisons ostracise the individual to further think society is against him. The second issue is that prisons are the biggest social hub for crime and the best crime school in any country.
1.3.1.4.2. Pro: Rehabilitation and reintegration is a better way for the criminal justice system to prioritise releasing people back into society and enforcing what is right and wrong. Emphasising these values will have a tremendous positive impact on wider society.
1.3.1.4.3. Pro: Successful rehabilitation leads to longer lasting safety. Rehabilitated prisoners could also become role models for other criminals and as such prove valuable to society.
1.3.1.4.3.1. Pro: The best way to solve crimes is to eliminate want, and help prisoners reflect: [meditation](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jenny-phillips/meditation-in-prision_b_1469180.html) may be a feasible way to help inmates within the framework of rehabilitation.
1.3.1.5. Pro: It would be wiser to teach offenders new skills and give them an opportunity to reintegrate into society, dependent on the psychological state of the individual and the nature of their crime.
1.3.1.5.1. Pro: Any person that is put into a prison should have the chance to change their ways.
1.3.1.5.2. Pro: Rehabilitating a prisoner with viable job skills reduces recidivism and provides a benefit to society when the prisoner is released.  Society gets as much benefit as the prisoner.
1.3.1.5.2.1. Pro: The key to a successful rehabilitation would be providing the inmate with a marketable job skill -- perhaps acquired through a work release program with the local community. You can give a hungry man a fish or you can teach him how to fish. Providing a marketable job skill is the latter.
1.3.1.5.3. Pro: Making sure that offenders are not prone to repeating their criminal behavior is what society is counting on upon their release. Rehabilitation has proven to work better than threats of more jail time.
1.3.1.6. Pro: Prisons are how we as a society are willing to treat the worst among us. The focus should be rehabilitation, or at least harm reduction, not punishment. Someone who is willing to commit the crime is living outside of our value system, and we can introduce it to them.
1.3.1.7. Pro: Long prison sentences disconnect convicted individuals further from society, which can leave them stranded and unable to cope upon release.
1.3.1.7.1. Con: The [vast majority](http://www.womeninprison.org.uk/research/key-facts.php) of female offenders - 70% - are serving short sentences of six months or less.
1.3.1.7.1.1. Pro: While this is [untrue for men](https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_sentences.jsp), this does not diminish the necessity of rehabilitation; indeed, arguably the need is augmented given the length of time away from normal society.
1.3.1.7.2. Pro: Unless sentenced to life imprisonment - and even then, some life sentences are abbreviated to 25 years, depending on behaviour - it is envisioned that the prisoner will at some point re-enter society. It is better to provide self-improvement opportunities to that individual in an effort to grow them out of their offending behaviour - and thus reduce recidivism - than to simply have the experience be punitive.
1.3.1.7.2.1. Pro: It is proven to work. In Norway [the incarceration rate](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/why-norways-prison-system-is-so-successful-2014-12?r=UK&IR=T) is just 75 per 100,000 people compared to 707 per 100,000 people in the US. It has one of the lowest recidivism rates 20% while the US has one of the highest at 76.6%. It has a relatively low level of crime, showing that the concept of "restorative justice", which focuses on rehabilitating prisoners, works.
1.3.1.7.2.1.1. Pro: With 1 to 2 million inmates, the US boasts the largest prison population in the world with a [vicious re-entry rate](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/rprts05p0510.pdf) \(~68%\). Disregarding the responsibility to rehabilitate and reintegrate prisoners - as children, parents and citizens - we ignore the core socioeconomic drivers of criminality, and so continue to perpetuate these recidivism rates.
1.3.1.7.2.1.2. Pro: A possible bi-product to the way they treat criminals and reform them is that Norway has one of the lowest murder rates in the world. [OECD data](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/how-s-life-2013/intentional-homicides_how_life-2013-graph34-en) from 2013 says Norway has 3rd lowest murder rate in the world, with fewer than five intentional homicides per 100,000 people each year.
1.3.1.7.2.1.3. Con: The connection here is pretty feeble, since there are an extraordinary amount of cultural differences between the two countries. A more effective comparison would be made between US cities or states that focus on punitive/rehabilitative systems differently.
1.3.1.7.2.1.3.1. Pro: Norway is more or less homogeneous \(white\), while the US is quite heterogeneous \(melting pot\). Directly comparing these countries is scientifically unsound.
1.3.1.7.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Immigrants make about [17%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Norway) of the population of Norway. In the US it stands at about [14%](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states). Those two countries are quite comparable.
1.3.1.7.2.2. Con: Self-improvement assumes a level of motivation on the part of the prisoner.  Sufficient punitive action can grow a prisoner out of their offending behavior, without having to be concerned with the personal motivation of a prisoner to improve themselves.
1.3.1.7.3. Pro: Prison as punishment - particularly for long sentences - only fosters a heart bent towards crime and a mind learning new ways to circumvent getting caught. An inmate released without rehabilitation means more crime \(and potentially more severe\), a higher chance of not getting caught and what remains is a broken individual trapped in a cycle that they can't break on their own without intervention.
1.3.1.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.5.1.
1.3.1.7.4. Pro: If prisoners are not allowed access to new technologies, upon release after a long sentence served they will be unable to use such basic tools as email or Google.
1.3.1.7.4.1. Con: It can be seen as part of punishment to not give the privilege of access to new technologies.
1.3.1.7.5. Con: Visitation is a general right that prisoners in the United States enjoy.
1.3.1.7.5.1. Con: Visitation does not fit into the punishment model of imprisonment, it instead suggests a more rehabilitative mindset. Ideally, under a rehabilitative prions model, we would do things along this line to lessen the strain caused by necessarily long prison sentences.
1.3.1.8. Con: Holistic rehabilitation is an unmeasurable goal that, in practice, could result in unfair punishment because the speed of rehabilitation does not correlate with the severity of the crime.
1.3.1.8.1. Con: Rehabilitation is an absolutely measurable goal, in the measure that a convict will not mean to commit a crime of the same nature.
1.3.1.8.2. Con: Rehabilitation does not distinguish convicts by "crime graveness", but by their capacity to interact normally with their fellow citizens.
1.3.1.8.3. Con: Rehabilitation could be measured quantitatively. Measurable goals could be: number of community service hours completed; number of visits with a life coach or jobs counsellor; number of times the inmate set a example for good behaviour; etc.
1.3.1.8.3.1. Pro: Additionally, the inmates can be informed/incentivised that should they fail their rehabilitation, they will continue to serve the rest of their sentence.
1.3.1.9. Con: Some people are fully committed to their cause \(terrorists, activists, etc.\) and will never accept or comply with rehabilitation.
1.3.2. Pro: There is plenty of evidence from a number of countries who have trialled or use rehabilitation-based prison systems that they work.
1.3.2.1. Pro: In the Netherlands, where the prison system focuses heavily on rehabilitation, there has been such a large decline in prison population that they have started accepting prisoners from [other countries](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/01/norwegian-inmates-sent-to-dutch-prison-cells-too-full).
1.3.2.2. Pro: Countries which focus more on rehabilitation, such as the Scandinavian countries or Germany, have demonstrable effect: very low re-offender rates, far fewer people in prison and lower crime rates.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: The overall cost of the prison system is also far less. They do pay much more for each inmate, but less overall, because the inmates don't return that often. Furthermore, former inmates contribute to society and pay taxes rather than sit around in a cell.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: It is a proven fact that prisons leaning more towards re-education and rehabilitation have showed better results in the reconstruction of the inmate's character - a wonderful example are the open prisons in Scandinavia \([Prison Life in Scandinavia](https://www.dailyscandinavian.com/prison-life-in-scandinavia/) \) - we need to remember that being locked up and not being able to freely choose for ourselves, although in less claustrophobic facilities than a cell, is already a punishment.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.4.1.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Finland's primary focus is on rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. As such their prisons are fairly open and the guards and inmates co-habitate on a friendly level. As such their recidivism rate is around twenty percent. [pri.org](https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-04-15/finlands-open-prisons-inmates-have-keys)
1.3.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.7.2.1.
1.3.2.5. Con: [The US and Norway](https://www.counterpunch.org/2016/02/26/prisoner-rehabilitation-around-the-world/) are particularly extreme examples and do not necessarily represent typical cases of penal systems focused on punishment or on rehabilitation.
1.3.2.6. Pro: The emphasis on rehabilitation of the Swedish model has dropped the reoffending rates [to about 40%](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/26/prison-sweden-not-punishment-nils-oberg) – less than half of those in the UK and most other European countries.
1.3.3. Pro: Rehabilitation is positive for those inmates who are involved in rehabilitating as well as those receiving rehabilitation. Training can be an example of rehabilitation as it provides useful skills and a sense of accomplishment. Inmates are both willing to provide training, and are frustrated when it is forbidden.
1.3.4. Pro: Restructuring the prison system to serve as a civil service based program instead of a communal criminal environment would be beneficial to both the offenders and the community.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Rehabilitation results in a "net good" increase in the behavior and mood of individuals, and populations as a whole.
1.3.5. Pro: Since not all prison sentences are life sentences, it is logical that a prison sentence should involve a rehabilitative function.
1.3.6. Pro: Making people resent society via prison will only make them more inclined to rebel and commit crimes, as punishment increases their sense of hopelessness within society.
1.3.7. Pro: Rehabilitation is a better deterrent to repeat offenses than the threat of being punished again.
1.3.7.1. Con: [Rehabilitation is not consistently effective](http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1160&context=srhonorsprog) in many jurisdictions within the US.
1.3.8. Con: If members of the community see that they will be merely "rehabilitated" rather than punished for crimes, they might not be as deterred from committing crimes - assuming rehabilitation is less harsh than straightforward punishment.
1.3.8.1. Con: After long sentences, if not given any hope of normal lives people wouldn't have much motivation to stay out of prison, because their lives would be really hard. If they are given the possibility of a new start and perspective, they would likely find the motivation to do better than that.
1.3.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.4.1.
1.3.8.3. Con: Punitive justice systems do not work, but rehabilitation [has been proven](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10514678/The-old-debate-punish-prisoners-or-rehabilitate-them.html) time and again to work.
1.3.8.3.1. Pro: Studies such as [this one](http://law.jrank.org/pages/1936/Rehabilitation-Does-correctional-rehabilitation-work.html) show that rehabilitation of criminals using models like the principles of effective intervention decreased the chance of repeat offending by as much as 25%, when compared to a controlled group who did not undergo the same rehabilitation treatment program.
1.3.8.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.3.8.3.3. Pro: Spain did an experiment where they legalised all drugs. This allowed users to turn to medical help without fear of being arrested, and demonstrates that an approach which prioritises rehabilitation over punishment can be [very successful](http://www.euronews.com/2013/11/06/spain-where-drug-consumption-is-not-a-crime).
1.3.8.3.4. Pro: Initiatives like [Project Return](http://www.projectreturninc.org) illustrate how a community focus on rehabilitation facilitates reintegration after incarceration.
1.3.8.3.5. Pro: People who commit crimes usually run some justification narrative in their heads. Change the narrative and you prevent future crimes. Punishment alone leaves the offender to change the narrative alone. This is less likely to work than helping them change their narratives so they obey the law. This is rehabilitation and it works in [Norway](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/why-norways-prison-system-is-so-successful-2014-12?r=US&IR=T) and the [Netherlands](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37904263).
1.3.8.4. Con: It [has been](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/2200) argued that most crimes are the product of emotion and passion - and that logical considerations about the possible punishment \(painful as it may be\) do not feature in the underlying considerations.
1.3.8.4.1. Con: If the punishment is sufficiently visually and publicly cruel, it will enter the public consciousness and be sufficiently present in the minds of even those who have otherwise lost control.
1.3.8.4.1.1. Con: Torturous punishment sets a bad precedent that could lead to future violence directed at good people under a less kind/rational regime.
1.3.8.4.1.2. Con: Historically, increasing cruelty of punishments has been shown to have the reverse effect. Though it does terrify many into submission, it also sparks rebellions and reformations; this is exemplified in how capital punishment and torture are [no](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_Kingdom) [longer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States) acceptable \(or at least heavily protested\) in a wide array of societies.
1.3.8.4.2. Con: Not all crimes are the products of passion, so deterrence would still apply to those crimes that are pre-meditated.
1.3.8.4.3. Pro: It has also been argued that many criminals are forced into being criminals. For example, someone who constantly struggles to get enough money for food may resort to stealing. In this case, the thief may logically decide that prison may actually be beneficial to him or her, as sufficient food is provided.
1.3.9. Pro: Punishing is not going to repair or undo the damage caused by criminals, so we are not missing anything by abolishing the punishment except for the satisfaction of revenge.
1.3.9.1. Con: Rehabilitation also does not 'undo' crimes committed against victims.
1.3.9.2. Con: This is a fault of how people are punished instead of a flaw of punishment as a concept.

Steal and get caught? Repay the victim not only for your theft but into a fund that completely covers the repayment of all thefts plus a punitive amount for inconvenience and the cost to society of your capture and trial.

The fiscal effects of crime could easily be brought to zero, paid for by criminals, and the average "reward" for crime could also be brought below zero.
1.3.9.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.3.7.3.1.
1.3.9.2.2. Con: This will not work for most crimes. People can't be unkilled, unraped, or unmaimed.
1.3.9.3. Pro: A majority of those who commit blue collar crimes have no self worth, self awareness or ability to see other avenues. [They have minimal education](http://www.prisonerseducation.org.uk/media-press/new-government-data-on-english-and-maths-skills-of-prisoners) for the most part and see no value in it. Rehabilitation would allow them the knowledge and skills to move past their personal limitations, [punishment does not improve or deter them in any way.](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/proven-reoffending-statistics-january-2016-to-march-2016)
1.3.9.4. Con: While punishment certainly does not restore damages already done, it does prevent future damages. Prisons are not built for any sense of vengeance, but to keep dangerous people out of society.
1.3.10. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.3.3.
1.4. Pro: The offender will be less likely to commit further crimes if there is an emphasis on rehabilitation while in prison.
1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.5.1.1.
1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.4.
1.4.3. Con: The argument can apply to most prisoners, but not for those convicted for very violent crimes.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Efforts for rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners convicted of violent crimes could be traumatising for the victims and their families.
1.4.3.2. Pro: The population and the victims could feel unprotected by their state law enforcement.
1.4.4. Pro: Using rehabilitation in a prison would not only isolate the criminal from society, but also help to form the prisoner into a morally better person and show them the "correct ways" of our society. This is the more peaceful and effective way to turn a prisoner's personality and morals around versus torturing them.
1.4.5. Pro: All things considered there is no long term gain to be had from crime, only negative outcomes so crime makes no sense for anyone except the desperately in need. The desperately in need will not 'learn' from punishment \(the desperate will act desperately\), and the rest might learn from rehabilitation/reintegration - but will not learn from punishment.
1.4.6. Pro: Crime makes zero sense for anyone except the desperately in need, who will not 'learn' from punishment \(the desperate will act desperately\). The rest might learn from rehabilitation/reintegration - but will not learn from punishment. There is no long term gain to be had from crime, only negative outcomes.
1.4.7. Pro: Unless prisoners are there for life, punishing them without making them into productive members of society risks making the crime happen again.
1.4.7.1. Pro: Not all prisoners are psychopaths or people with a disposition to commit crime. A crime can be situational, stimulated by the situation the crime was committed in. It is important that rehabilitation services take place in prisons. Re-housing, counselling, education and support for prisoners with bad outside relationships are some examples of rehabilitation services in prisons. Without these services a prisoner will be released into a situation that may not have changed, causing recidivism.
1.4.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.5.1.
1.4.7.2. Pro: Even if the prisoners are there for life, this is even more reason not to punish them. Punishing a person who is serving life is punishment for the sake of punishment, not deterrent against future misbehaviour, and therefore unnecessarily cruel.
1.4.7.3. Pro: The National Institute for Justice says, within 5 years of release, about 3 of 4 released prisoners were rearrested. Of those, over half were [arrested](https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/recidivism-among-federal-offenders-comprehensive-overview) by the end of the 1st year. 2 reasons for this high proportion are parole violations and unemployment. The lack of a job itself can cause a parole violation for some. If vo-tech certificates, and mindfulness thinking were taught, parolees would get more jobs that can support a family and they would not need to commit crimes just to live.
1.4.7.4. Con: If the punishment is cruel enough, it will work as a deterrent.
1.4.7.4.1. Pro: Punishing criminals is a proven effective way to dissuade prisoners from committing future crimes, as well as a deterrent to would-be criminals worried about punishment.
1.4.7.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.8.3.
1.4.7.4.1.2. Con: [Deterrence is shown](https://nij.gov/five-things/pages/deterrence.aspx) to be dependent on knowing that an infraction will be punished, not on the severity of the punishment.
1.4.7.4.1.2.1. Pro: Criminals rarely know the sanctions for their actions at the time of their crimes.
1.4.7.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: It [has been](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/2200) argued that most crimes are the product of emotion and passion - and that logical considerations about the possible punishment \(painful as it may be\) do not feature in the underlying considerations.
1.4.7.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: If the punishment is sufficiently visually and publicly cruel, it will enter the public consciousness and be sufficiently present in the minds of even those who have otherwise lost control.
1.4.7.4.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Torturous punishment sets a bad precedent that could lead to future violence directed at good people under a less kind/rational regime.
1.4.7.4.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Not all crimes are the products of passion, so deterrence would still apply to those crimes that are pre-meditated.
1.4.7.4.1.2.1.2. Pro: Surveys suggest that the general public is not well-informed about the [legal system](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/539955/pdf),  [current reforms](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02336666) in the area and their implications - even in the case of [criminal justice majors](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036233190300096X).
1.4.7.4.1.2.1.3. Pro: The degree of punishment and whether the crime thereby qualifies as a felony is anything but predictable. [Prosecutors](http://thecrimereport.org/2012/12/28/2012-12-study-prosecutorial-discretion-leads-to-inconsistent/#.UOW5Cw9uIio.wordpress) frequently have a broad range of discretion as to what charges to file, and juries can often choose between felony and misdemeanor convictions, resulting in inconsistency.
1.4.7.4.1.3. Pro: Punishment is the only deterrent that hardcore criminals understand. Loss of freedom is the one universal fear that is common to men. Psychiatric care and counselling while well intentioned are a waste of resources and usually only used to bypass the actual punishment such as actual time served in a prison.
1.4.7.4.1.4. Con: Deterrence views punishment not as an end in itself, but as a means of conditioning society to avoid criminal behavior. As such, deterrence seeks rehabilitation as its goal; it's "societal rehab," if you will.
1.4.7.4.1.5. Pro: Not punishing someone for a crime effectively gives them an "easy way out" and would result in more crime that people deemed worth the consequences.
1.4.7.4.1.5.1. Pro: If prisons became places where criminals are treated kindly then they wouldn't be so afraid to commit any crime, as they know the punishment will not be hard to deal with.
1.4.7.4.1.5.2. Pro: Prison itself should be a deterrent, especially for violent crimes. Those who crave physical power are unlikely to be phased by a prison system that provides an environment where they can be dominant, and supplies free education, free food, free rooms, and conjugal visits. In a number of places that's an upgrade, not a deterrent.
1.4.7.4.1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.4.7.4.1.5.4. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.4.1.
1.4.7.4.1.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.1.4.1.
1.4.7.4.1.5.6. Pro: There are indeed some people who would abuse the system, and not intend to change at all.
1.4.7.4.1.5.6.1. Con: Don't let perfection be the enemy of the good. That some people would abuse the rehabilitation system is not sufficient reason to avoid rehabilitation altogether.
1.4.7.4.1.5.7. Con: Most programs to re-integrate people aren't easy. Work-release programs, for example, usually go from back-breaking menial work to bed, still being boarded in a corrections facility of sorts.
1.4.7.4.1.5.8. Con: Rehabilitation does not give prisoners an "easy way out". More commonly, prisoners are expected to have completed some rehabilitation before being granted parole. In this respect rehabilitation is a "harder" way out.
1.4.7.4.1.6. Pro: The consequences of rape, death or acid attacks are lifelong. The criminal has done so much damage in a horrible way and gets no punishment and shorter sentences.
1.4.7.4.1.6.1. Con: When possible, we have a moral imperative to convert destructive, dangerous people into functioning members of society. Ex-convicts can be valuable allies in understanding the pathology that motivated them, and can speak the language of those tempted to commit the crimes they did.
1.4.7.4.1.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.7.6.1.
1.4.7.4.1.7. Con: Criminal enterprises have adapted to prison, and usually have a command structure within that protects their own. The dissuading power is lowered when your gang de facto controls the facility.
1.4.7.4.1.8. Pro: For deterrence to work in practice, it is necessary to apply punishment in a rational and systematic way. A system focusing on rehabilitation does not apply punishment in a systematic way, so it necessarily leads to unjust treatment of prisoners by having fuzzy goal lines.
1.4.7.4.1.9. Pro: Classic behaviourist studies show that punishment is the fastest way to change behaviour. So even insofar as the objective is rehabilitation rather than deterrence, punishment should be the preferred means.

1.4.7.4.1.9.1. Con: These studies emphasize that for conditioning to really be effective, reward or punishment must immediately follow the behavior being targeted.
1.4.7.4.1.9.2. Con: Aversion therapy is symptomatic in nature, treating behaviors, but not the causes behind them.
1.4.7.4.1.9.2.1. Pro: As a result of aversion therapy's surface level treatment, these problems may express themselves in different ways, for example, by committing different crimes, or actions that border on the line of criminality.
1.4.7.4.1.9.3. Con: Without counting aversion therapy, it tends to [wear off](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-aversion-therapy-2796001).
1.4.7.4.1.9.4. Con: The conditions of these studies are far too controlled and simplified to make them effective proxies for evaluating criminal behavior.
1.4.7.4.1.10. Con: This is the opposite of the truth. In fact, punishment-based deterrence is a [proven](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/2007/01/the_irrational_18yearold_criminal.html) [ineffective](http://www.angelfire.com/vt/dheslin/capit.html) [way](http://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Deterrence-in-Criminal-Justice.pdf) to [dissuade](https://nij.gov/five-things/pages/deterrence.aspx) [prisoners](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/449268) from [committing](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418828700089271) [future crimes.](https://undark.org/article/deterrence-punishments-dont-reduce-crime/)
1.4.7.4.1.10.1. Pro: Harsh punishment persuades criminals to learn how to get away with the commission of crimes, at least as effectively as dissuading from crime altogether. In this way, punishment actually encourages dishonest behavior, on top of failing as an effective deterrent to crime.
1.4.7.4.1.10.2. Pro: If the punishment method was at all efficacious, we would have seen results from the increasingly draconian methods that escalated in severity of punishment from the 70s to the 2000s decade. Instead, our recidivism continues to be at a rate of more than 67%. Given this evaluation, it would seem that we create more criminals than we prevent. [www.ussc.gov](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-projects-and-surveys/miscellaneous/15-year-study/chap2.pdf)  [www.bjs.gov](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=1135)  [www.bjs.gov](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=1134)  [www.bjs.gov](https://www.bjs.gov/content/reentry/recidivism.cfm)
1.4.7.4.1.10.3. Pro: Harsh prison conditions can increase recidivism rather than reduce it. [Prison Conditions and Recidivism Francesco Drago  Roberto Galbiati  Pietro Vertova American Law and Economics Review, Volume 13, Issue 1, 1 March 2011, Pages 103–130](https://academic.oup.com/aler/article-abstract/13/1/103/183298)
1.4.7.4.1.10.4. Pro: Punishment doesn't deter those criminals who happen to lack empathetic ability because they cannot empathize with their future imprisoned selves.
1.4.7.4.1.11. Pro: Only focusing on rehabilitation undermines how society uses prisons: as a punishment to deter future crimes, and send a message that the crime was wrong. By only rehabilitating, it sends the message that the criminals were not wrong, but had a reason or mental problem that can be fixed. This borders more on making excuses for the accused then accountability to be held responsible for their actions.
1.4.7.4.1.11.1. Con: If someone commits a crime, they do have a reason, even if it was illogical or rooted in mental illness. Having reasons for doing something does not negate the illegality or immorality of a crime. Prosecutors wouldn't spend so much time looking for motives if reasons aren't important.
1.4.7.4.1.12. Con: Assuming our legal system is based on ethical principles of mutual conduct that the society at large agrees upon, incentives to act lawfully based primarily on fear of punishment prevent an understanding of legal responsibility as ethically correct behaviour. Punishment of unlawful action can only represent such ethical principles by existing within a system that facilitates the ability of criminals to recognise and understand what they did was wrong and why.
1.4.7.4.1.12.1. Con: There is no real reason to believe that our laws are in fact based on agreed-upon ethical principles of mutual conduct.
1.4.7.4.1.12.2. Pro: [Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development) seem to support the idea that we should push people further down this path.
1.4.7.4.1.12.3. Pro: In democracies, these people will have a direct impact on what laws and regulations get passed, ideally, they should have a full grasp of ethics, but we at least want them to move passed avoiding punishment, or tailoring the law to serve them.
1.4.8. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.3.
1.4.9. Con: A shorter prison stay and an emphasis on rehabilitation afterwards would be even more effective, as offenders would learn to integrate positively with society in an authentic context, rather than in confinement.
1.4.9.1. Con: Probably not, because the influence you can have on the life of the inmate is much stronger while he is in the prison. Not using this time for rehabilitation is simply missing out on a chance.
1.4.10. Pro: Behaviorist research has demonstrated that while punishment typically changes behavior more quickly, reward changes it in a more lasting way by creating a positive relationship with the authorities and institutions providing the reinforcement.

1.4.10.1. Con: The citations provided are not reputable or reliable. Therefore, the evidence regarding lasting rehabilitation should be taken with a grain of salt.
1.4.11. Con: Rehabilitation based incarceration is subject to the offender's risk level. High risk offenders are less likely to embrace rehabilitation and thus punitive measures are necessary. Prisons are typically filled with high risk offenders, as low risk offenders are likely on probation or some other type of community based supervision.
1.4.11.1. Con: The only level without programs is 4. Every other level has programs. Every inmate has a release date. If they are not educated and trained they will return in a few years. It is in society's interest to make sure parolees have the skills to integrate so they contribute rather than commit crimes.
1.4.11.2. Con: Prisons are not typically filled with high risk offenders, they are typically filled with mandatory minimum sentenced[low level drug users](https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_offenses.jsp).
High risk offenders are not common enough to warrant a punitive-based system, except in specialised high-security facilities designed to house those uncommon cases.
1.4.11.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.3.3.
1.4.11.2.2. Pro: Since prisons are filled with drug users/dealers, revolutionising the prison system to guarantee an appropriate treatment for those people would reduce incredibly the number of prisoners, and allow a focus on the rehabilitation of every criminal while also sparing plenty of resources.
1.4.12. Con: Most, if not all, businesses do take social conduct as an important way of gauging character during the recruitment phase. This means most ex-convicts entering social rehabilitation programs would find themselves committing crimes once more due to their inability to find a job.
1.4.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.5.1.
1.5. Pro: Prisons must prioritise rehabilitation because highly punitive sentences cause harms to the prisoners.
1.5.1. Con: There is such a big variety of offences and crimes that it is impossible to apply this statement to all of them. For capital crimes there should be fewer options to 'go back to society' than for traffic offenders. A good criterium could be to what extent the crime committed has shocked society; in general \(in European courts\), this is also used as contributory factor in determining the extent of punishment.
1.5.2. Pro: If the purpose of incarceration is rehabilitation, we could customize the length of time a person remains behind bars individually according to the length of time it takes them to successfully be rehabilitated. This could potentially save taxpayers an enormous amount of money. It would also reduce the probability of judicial bias.
1.5.3. Pro: Part of the sentencing could include educational, and/or skill targets that, if accomplished, would reduce their sentences. For that to work, we must provide the means for them to reach those goals.
1.5.4. Pro: A plethora of research indicates many modern practices such as [solitary confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement) exacerbate mental health symptoms, thus increasing recidivism rates.
1.5.5. Con: It is possible to be punitive without being excessively or harshly so.
1.5.6. Con: The deterrent effect that punishment has on potential felons in the community outweighs the benefit of rehabilitation to the captured felon.
1.5.6.1. Con: Recidivism in American prisons \(punishment\) is approximately three times as high as recidivism in Norwegian prisons \(rehabilitation\). [nij.gov](https://www.nij.gov/topics/corrections/recidivism/Pages/welcome.aspx#statistics) [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4472929/) [kriminalomsorgen.no](http://www.kriminalomsorgen.no/information-in-english.265199.no.html)[Incarceration and Recidivism: Lessons from Abroad](http://www.salve.edu/sites/default/files/filesfield/documents/Incarceration_and_Recidivism.pdf)
1.5.7. Con: Prisoners, having caused harm themselves, have placed themselves outside of the normal protections of society to some extent - including protection from harm by way of punishment.
1.5.7.1. Con: Punishing someone simply because they are unprotected is not effective.
1.5.8. Pro: Rehabilitation is the best course of action to take when dealing with law-breakers. Dealing with violent acts with more violence can only ever continue to spiral, without ever being solved.
1.6. Pro: It is morally acceptable for prisons to focus on rehabilitation.
1.6.1. Pro: The morality of a society is key to keep it healthy and improving. A prison should teach its prisoners why what they did was wrong and how acting in an empathetic way to others ultimately comes back to oneself. A building with the only purpose of inflicting damage with no "path" for the tortured to follow and meditate about is medieval and socially degradative.
1.6.2. Pro: Helping people \(via rehabilitation\) is the morally right thing to do.
1.6.2.1. Pro: It is more moral to make someone better, than to just punish them for being bad.
1.6.2.2. Con: This presupposes that the criminal wants to be law-abiding, and just needs help to achieve that. However, criminals already know the alternatives and yet chose the anti-social behavior.
1.6.2.2.1. Con: Rehabilitation does not require that the offender desire to be rehabilitated. \([Behavioural therapy](https://www.simplypsychology.org/behavioral-therapy.html) uses punishment and reward to condition behavioural responses regardless of the cooperation of the subject\).
1.6.2.2.1.1. Con: 'Helping people' means providing assistance and/or resources in order to achieve their goals. Forcing people to change their goals against their will can therefore not be considered 'helping them'. More accurately, this should be referred to as 'breaking their will' or 'brainwashing them'.
1.6.2.2.1.2. Pro: To be rehabilitated against one's will is arguably a lesser violation of autonomy than to be imprisoned and punished against one's will. If the lesser violation is the morally right choice, then rehabilitation is the morally right choice regardless of the cooperation of the subject.
1.6.2.2.2. Con: This in turn, presupposes something about all criminals and further about "choice" without evidence to back up either. This seems to assume that all people have the same background, the same "choices" available, the same awareness of their circumstances. If this were true, then education-based rehabilitation wouldn't work, when in fact, it shows great promise in some circumstances. Especially given the noted high rates of illiteracy in the criminal population.
1.6.3. Pro: If you attempt to rehabilitate someone who was innocent, you're not out as much. Maybe this person was in the wrong place, wrong time, and can learn to avoid being in that situation. At least the goal is betterment of that individual. If you punish someone that's innocent, you've done nothing but set the government up for punitive damages.
1.6.4. Pro: Rehabilitation is supported by Kant's philosophy of [human dignity](https://kantphilosophy.wordpress.com/kants-ethics/the-good-will/): “A good will is good not because of what it effects, or accomplishes, not because of its fitness to attain some intended end, but good just by its willing, i.e. in itself..." With this, Kant suggests that it is the intention rather than the outcome \(or the potential for outcome\) that makes an action good.
1.6.4.1. Con: This can be regarded as an appeal to [authority fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority).
1.6.4.1.1. Con: Here, Kant is used more to clarify the claim then to support it, making it the philosophy of human dignity instead of just a vague appeal to dignity.
1.6.4.2. Con: By "good will" Kant does not mean anything like the conventional idea of "good will towards others." Rather, he means that a moral act is that which comes from a recognition of one's duty, instead of good feelings or whatever maximizes utility. Unless we presuppose that rehabilitation is a duty over and above just punishment \(which would be circular\), Kant's moral philosophy is neutral regarding the question of rehabilitation vs punishment.
1.6.5. Con: It is more acceptable to focus on what is 'just' for victims and society, rather than prioritising the rights of prisoners.
1.6.5.1. Pro: What is best for victims is that the crime does not happen again.
1.6.5.2. Con: For theists, humans are not the arbiters of justice, but rather, higher spiritual authorities are. We should focus on reducing the number and scope of evil actions for practical reasons, but it is not up to us to decide what is a just punishment. Instead, we should seek an effective punishment.
1.6.5.2.1. Pro: -> See discussion #2629: [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism) exists.
1.6.5.2.2. Con: According to a popular motto, God also claims to have a great love for humans that [help themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helps_those_who_help_themselves). Society seems more interested in helping themselves than waiting for the almighty to clean up 'our messes' for us.
1.6.5.2.3. Con: [God does not exist.](https://www.kialo.com/existence-of-god-2629/2629.0=2629.1/=2629.1)
1.6.5.2.4. Con: Perhaps we shouldn't bring the concept of God into a reasoned, rational debate. Not everyone believes in God. God's existence is not a fact - that's why belief in God is called faith.
1.6.5.2.4.1. Con: The fact that not everyone believes in God does not imply that it’s not a fact.  There are lots of facts that not everyone believes in.
1.6.5.2.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.1.
1.6.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.3.1.4.
1.6.5.4. Con: To many people, justice is worthless.
1.6.5.4.1. Pro: Justice doesn't add to any measures, such as universal happiness.
1.6.5.4.1.1. Con: A study found out that the absence of fair treatment has a negative impact on individuals' self-esteem and causes negative moods; Fairness has a positive impact \([Meier et al., p. 652](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.728.5415&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\).
1.6.5.4.1.1.1. Con: People can be treated fairly without the use of retributive justice.
1.6.5.4.2. Pro: Kant's moral theory of [universal law of nature](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/) says to "act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law." Not many people want to live in a vindictive society obsessed with revenge.
1.6.5.4.3. Pro: Under some veins of virtue theory, such as the theological virtues listed [here,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_virtues) justice for justice's sake is not valuable, just another form of wrath.
1.6.5.4.4. Pro: Kant's theory of human dignity says this is undignified: justice, such as an eye for an eye, would have us all feuding like the [Hatfields and McCoys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield%E2%80%93McCoy_feud), a state that borders between intrinsically horrific, and comically farcical.
1.6.5.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.3.1.3.
1.6.5.4.4.2. Con: [Immanuel Kant](http://tragicfarce.com/tag/immanuel-kant/) said that a society that is not willing to demand a life of somebody who has taken somebody else's life is simply immoral.
1.6.5.4.4.2.1. Con: This is an [appeal to authority](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority); Immanuel Kant saying so does not, by itself, make it so. Particularly in this case, where his opinion on the death penalty was exactly that - an opinion.  He failed to back it up by construction from the system of ethics he developed - a system from which one can rationally argue exactly the opposite position just as easily.
1.6.5.4.4.2.1.1. Con: Not many people are familiar with Kant's work today unless they specifically know about the theory of human dignity, so this 'appeal to authority' would not be very effective.
1.6.5.4.4.2.1.1.1. Con: It's hard to prove a negative, all that can be really said to support this is personal experience.
1.6.5.4.4.2.1.2. Con: Although this somewhat goes against the grain of Kant's theory of intent instead of consequences, he did have a method for evaluating morality, the [categorical imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative).
1.6.5.4.4.2.2. Con: Most sane people would agree that killing a helpless person is bad, these people, using [Kant's philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantian_ethics) would argue that is enough grounds to say it's always bad, and even if you can find a case where it might provide some benefit, the rule should stick.
1.6.5.4.4.2.3. Pro: Kant said: "However many they may be who have committed a murder, or have even commanded it, or acted as art and part in it, they ought all to suffer death; for so justice wills it,"  [\(Science of Right \(1790\) by Immanuel Kant\)](http://www1.american.edu/dgolash/Kant_on_Punishment.htm)
1.6.5.4.4.2.4. Con: Kant's own ethical system has some controversial issues: the most well-noted is that were a murderer to show up at your house looking for an intended victim that you were hiding, you would [not be allowed to lie to the murderer](https://philpapers.org/rec/KANOAS-2) \(even though your silence would be an admission\). Hence subsequent philosophers have had to reconcile this with the rest of his ethics.
1.6.5.4.4.2.4.1. Con: Every moral philosophy - at least, every one humans could create - is flawed; this does not by any means make them useless.
1.6.5.5. Pro: The basis for such a system is [social contract theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_school_\(criminology\)). Social contract theory is an idea that individuals give up certain rights in exchange for the rule of law and security. In such a system, rights are protected, while infringement of other rights is punished by law.
1.6.5.6. Pro: [Beccaria](http://www.iep.utm.edu/beccaria/) in the first treatise on penology argued that crime should be considered an injury to all in society, while punishment should focus on deterrence for the good of society, rather than on notions of retribution.
1.6.5.7. Con: An approach focusing on proportionate punishment still considers the rights of prisoners not to be unduly punished beyond a reasonable sentence.
1.6.5.8. Con: Victims and society will not be positively affected by punishment any more than they will by rehabilitation - each will take the perpetrator out of society. "An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind," - injury done to the perpetrator does not undo the crime committed.
1.6.6. Pro: People are imperfect and make mistakes; as such, not everyone who has the label of a 'wrongdoer' needs to be confined to that label eternally. Some people have the resilience and genuine motivation to reform themselves and should be given the chance to do so through rehabilitation programmes.
1.6.7. Pro: With the designation of a practical methodology to determine individual viability for rehabilitation, covering the classification of the wrongdoing/criminal history and appropriate psychological examination, a significant portion of prisoners could be helped.
1.7. Con: Focusing only on rehabilitation can lead to excessive and arbitrarily long "treatments."
1.7.1. Pro: If we get rid of the idea that people deserve retributive punishment, then what people do or do not deserve is irrelevant to how we treat them. Thus, society has no resources to say that a "treatment" is excessive or goes beyond what is justly deserved. Criminals can be forced to undergo absolutely anything the "experts" deem good for them, without the restraint that comes from notions of proportionality and justice.
1.7.1.1. Con: Removing retributive justice does not lead to an open-ended regard for prisoners. There can still be laws which guide and instruct us. It is simply a matter of shifting the end goal. Shock therapy may not be employed, but perhaps not limiting their job and housing options which in turn forces them back to illicit means of financial stability. We may not torture them, but cause them to work on nation building projects which teach them valuable skills and benefit the society they harmed.
1.8. Pro: Prisons are an inadequate response to any crime.
1.8.1. Pro: If one accepts that rehabilitation is the primary mission of a justice penance, then educational principles should apply and in particular a [clear linkage between the fault or crime and the penance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZSTu98-Cus). Being deprived of freedom is not an educational penance.
1.8.2. Pro: [Between 20 and 40%](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/americas-largest-mental-hospital-is-a-jail/395012/) of mentally ill people in the US will be incarcerated in their life. The US prison system is currently used as a substitute for propper professional care weak individuals.
1.8.3. Pro: Prisons epitomize a civilisation of punishment, as opposed to a civilization of care and education. In other terms, prisons are the solution we have found to problems we did not want to adress properly in the first place. Punishing crime is often very counter-productive. [How we approach the question of drug addiction is a very clear example of that.](https://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_everything_you_think_you_know_about_addiction_is_wrong)
1.8.4. Con: There are cases where no simple way exists of adressing the needs of someone in a way that is both respectful of their freedom, and does not put danger into society. In those cases, prisons may well be the only solution.
1.8.5. Pro: We all think that prison is a penance. But it's not. Penance is what one does after a judgement where one was found guilty to atone for their crimes or infractions, and try to repair the damage to the extent it can. Prisons prevent inmates from repairing any damage, and therefore is only a prolongation of the judgment. Penance does not happen... The principle of depriving someone from freedom, deprives them also from learning from their mistakes.
1.8.5.1. Con: Prison sentences reflect the debt owed to society for violating its defined laws and have nothing to do with penance or restitution to the victim of the crime. Convicts are free to pursue penance and/or forgiveness from the victim once their debt to society has been repaid.
1.8.5.1.1. Con: If the purpose is for the criminal to pay their 'debt to society', what is the 'currency'? Simply depriving the criminal of /their/ life time and freedom doesn't 'repay' or recover the time or expense of the victims or society.
1.8.6. Pro: Prisons create the illusion that we have ridden society of troublesome elements. But we haven't. Inmates have friends, families, parents, and their lives on the inside affect countless lives on the outside. Therefore they are still part of society, only in a way that is so constrained that they are deprived of any possibility of meaningful contribution to it. It's like putting seeds on a concrete ground and saying: "Now grow".
1.8.7. Pro: There are prisons that have no walls and put emphasis on keeping the connection between inmates and the community... I do not think we can describe these as prisons anymore. The [Iwahig](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2015/10/life-philippines-prison-walls-151007074700822.html) prison in the Philippines is a great example.
1.8.8. Con: If a criminal is a danger to society \(serial rapist/murderer etc.\) then prisons are a way of ensuring public safety by removing them from the population until such a time as they can be rehabilitated and are no longer a danger, or their death.
1.8.8.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.2.
1.9. Con: The question forces a false dilemma -- that society must choose punishment OR rehabilitation.  A prison sentence should be for both punishment \(to deter crime and protect society\) and rehabilitation \(to attempt to make the offender a productive member of society\).
1.9.1. Con: The proposition talks about a primary focus. That does not imply that both cannot be persued so it is not a false dilemma. A secondary focus could be integration or punishment for that matter, depending on which one is chosen as the primary focus.
1.9.2. Pro: Punishment is often understood as a way to achieve rehabilitation. Mistakenly or not, negative reinforcement seeks rehabilitation.
1.9.3. Pro: Prisons exist to meet the societal goals of the sentence; retribution, incapacitation, specific or individual deterrence, rehabilitation, and reintegration. However, in meeting these goals, we have to insure equity, justness, and societal cost. Rehab and reentry are a part of the equation, but not the totality. We must have the elements of each to a degree for imprisonment to properly work.
1.9.4. Pro: The punishment/rehabilitation continuum should be aligned with the length of the sentence. As the release date becomes more imminent, the alignment should shift toward rehabilitation so that the soon to be released inmate can successfully integrate into society and become an asset rather than a liability.
1.9.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.5.2.
1.10. Pro: Rehabilitation ultimately would drive down the cost of imprisonment to the community.
1.10.1. Con: Rehabilitation would add additional operating costs that detract from the primary goal of a prison: incarceration.
1.10.1.1. Con: By focusing on rehabilitation of criminals and the development of their well-being, society can decrease recidivism rates \([76.6% are rearrested](https://www.nij.gov/topics/corrections/recidivism/Pages/welcome.aspx) within 5 years of release\) as well as the recurring costs of arresting a person multiple times. In turn, this will decrease the amount of taxpayer dollars allocated to operating prisons.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: Though rehabilitation methods may help with this issue, a large part of the problem is what happens outside of prison, not inside it. Prisoners, once released, are often forced back into crime because no one wants to hire someone with a criminal record. Often they are even treated better in prison than they would be in freedom.
1.10.1.2. Pro: Many inmates have serious mental illnesses that would be cost-prohibitive to effectively rehabilitate.
1.10.1.2.1. Pro: Mentally ill criminals not capable of rehabilitation would be better suited to be treated in a secure psychiatric facility than a prison.
1.10.1.2.2. Pro: You can't rehabilitate a psychopath. Psychopathy is [untreatable](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wicked-deeds/201408/psychopathic-criminals-cannot-be-cured); it can be managed, but never cured.
1.10.1.2.2.1. Con: [To the contrary](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1524838006288929): 'when an appropriately designed treatment program is implemented, effectiveness of treatment can be demonstrated'.
1.10.1.2.3. Con: Penning up mentally ill people is not a good solution for them or their cellmates, especially if they are violent.
1.10.1.2.4. Con: If inmates have serious mental illness, they should be treated regardless of whether or not rehabilitation is the goal.
1.10.1.2.5. Con: Knowingly releasing mentally ill people into society with no attempt at rehabilitation is negligent.
1.10.1.3. Pro: Punishment without rehabilitation is significantly less expensive.
1.10.1.3.1. Con: Punishment without rehabilitation decreases the chances that ex-convicts will be able to be productive members of society, thereby curtailing their economic earning and spending potential.
1.10.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.10.1.1.
1.10.1.4. Pro: When rehabilitation becomes the focus of the prison, evidence has shown in other countries that the elderly and homeless begin to commit crime simply for the expensive benefits that prison can provide. Japan's elderly account for 20% of all crime — and it's turning [prisons into nursing homes](http://www.businessinsider.com/japan-senior-crime-rate-turning-prisons-into-nursing-homes-2017-1).
1.10.1.5. Con: Rehabilitation does not necessarily have to be the responsibility of the institution. The administration need only allow volunteers and volunteer organizations to enter the facility, which typically requires only minor staffing changes to accommodate.
1.10.1.5.1. Con: This doesn't reduce overall costs to the society, only shifts the burden onto someone else.
1.10.1.5.2. Con: Instead of allocating taxpayer money to the problem, this model would depend on volunteers providing their time and resources, which is arguably a less stable system.
1.10.2. Pro: Programs that include physical work can reduce the actual imprisonment costs as the prisons then serve as a production line.
1.10.2.1. Pro: This also offers the prisoners the opportunity to learn real skills which then can give them a job outside of prison, making it easier for them to reintegrate into society.
1.10.3. Con: This might suggest a system believing that 'the shorter in prison, the better'. However, even the best concept needs some time to be implemented. Minimising the imprisonment time due to economical reasons might increase the rate of recidivism, so it is neither sure whether this idea would have a better effect, nor whether it'd cut the cost of the whole program.
1.10.3.1. Con: Such a motto is good provided that the system works properly. One advantage of rehabilitation over punishment is that prison as a punishment has to last a certain amount of time, while rehabilitation is connected with effect, so could be shorter. If it wasn't we would still get a result as opposed to only punishing.
1.10.4. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.1.
1.10.5. Pro: If rehabilitation is effective for a convicted criminal, then there would be a reduction in social costs to the community.
1.10.5.1. Pro: Social costs as a result of imprisonment include: a reliance on social welfare as one income earner is lost in a family for the duration of the imprisonment, inability to obtain employment after imprisonment due to stigmatisation and difficulties readjusting to the community after institutionalisation.
1.10.6. Pro: The money saved on prison costs can then be put towards preventative measures such as drug rehabilitation centres to further decrease the incarceration rate.
1.10.7. Con: It's unfair to make the victim or innocent citizens pay taxes to rehabilitate the prisoner. The victim should be indemnified instead.
1.10.8. Pro: Punishment-focused systems lead to determining 'fair' sentencing length during trial, often based on comparison to preceding cases. Rehabilitation-focused systems can avoid this decision and rather optimise for time and probability of successful re-integration into society.
1.10.8.1. Pro: By the same token, if we could rehabilitate prisoners and change prison sentences to correspond with when rehabilitation is complete, then false imprisonments become less burdensome.
1.10.8.1.1. Con: Realistically at least some people will be wrongfully convicted; a focus on "rehabilitation" can and [does further punish](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/wrongly-convicted-men-launch-new-case-against-the-justice-secretary-9985773.html) these people for refusing to confess or repent their nonexistent crimes.
1.10.8.1.1.1. Con: It is not clear that a focus on punishment would avoid this scenario.
1.10.8.1.1.2. Con: When punishment is the focus, we treat people badly, even [torturing](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/sadistic-prison-guard-accused-torturing-inmates-article-1.3814654) and [killing them](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2523566/Prison-guard-caught-camera-throwing-inmate-ground-later-died-injuries.html). Even if a focus on rehabilitation increased an innocent's sentence, they would probably prefer that over being killed, tortured, or abused.
1.10.8.1.1.3. Con: Punishment is actually worse/less preferable than rehabilitation if you haven't committed the crime.
1.10.8.2. Pro: Prisons are largely overcrowded and an approach that safely early-releases criminals when they are ready to be released would cut down on overcrowding and associated costs.
1.11. Con: -> See 1.4.7.4.1.
1.12. Con: Punishment exists on a spectrum: from criminal fines and suspended sentences in the community, to deprivation of liberty in prisons and then to capital punishment. The penal system should focus on these options to assess what is best for society and the community.
1.12.1. Pro: If our only options are punishment or rehabilitation, we tacitly accept the need for prisons in our society: [arguably](https://theoccupiedtimes.org/?p=13767), the prison system can be abolished without crime running rampant through communities.
1.12.1.1. Pro: Prison is a tragic moral compromise that we make to live in the society that we do. It is barbaric, and ideally in the far future there will be a far better answer for problems of criminal justice. It is imperative that we make this compromise with as much care and attention to the inhumanity of what we are doing as is possible.
1.12.1.2. Con: While it is certainly fair to claim that the prison system has been abused, it cannot be abolished without a large amount of reform. We cannot just say by fiat prisons are bad, therefore let everyone out. Prisons need to be made redundant, through rehabilitation, care for mentally unstable individuals, changes in laws to decriminalise lesser offences and other unstated methods.
1.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.
1.12.3. Pro: 'Crime' is not a one-size-fits-all term. People who abuse narcotics can't be equivocated with a gangland murderer.
1.12.3.1. Con: Either a certain behavior is anti-social enough to warrant a prison sentence, in which case it needs to be punished, or it should not carry a prison sentence at all.
1.12.3.1.1. Con: Crime is not limited to anti-social behavior. Some behavior that is not anti-social is punished by a prison sentence.
1.12.4. Pro: What is acceptable punishment is guided by the community and reform committees. It is not acceptable to make prisoners engage in hard labour, be subject to torture or to hold prisoners in unsanitary environments. Punishment therefore has limits about what should be regarded as appropriate.
1.12.4.1. Con: The fact that there are concessions that dictate what is acceptable for prisoners tacitly supports the notion that prisons are not just for punishment. Rehabilitation through work units and psychological programs are incorporated during prison sentences to enable the restoration of the individual to the community after the completion of sentence.
1.12.4.1.1. Con: These however are secondary to the aim of removing the convicted from the community in the first instance and depriving the prisoner of liberty as a consequence of their wrongdoing.
1.12.4.2. Pro: It is possible to prioritise the punishment component even in a system that is not unacceptably punitive.
1.12.4.3. Pro: It is possible to prioritise punishment without being inhumane.
1.12.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.4.1.
1.12.4.3.2. Con: The act of punishment is inhumane, as it compromises human dignity.
1.12.4.4. Con: We may agree this is a priority, but at least a few prisons [do not follow](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/210160.pdf) any sort of humanitarian guidelines, [and even brag about it](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/25/politics/sheriff-joe-arpaio-donald-trump-pardon/index.html). Until we can be certain that all prisoners are treated in a humane manner, with natural limits to what can be - and is - done to them, we necessarily must assume those safeguards do not exist.
1.12.5. Pro: Alternative forms of sentencing exist for rehabilitation already. Jail is a last resort, isolating the worst offenders from the rest of society.
1.12.5.1. Con: If isolation is the goal of incarceration, then prisoners should be isolated, not necessarily punished.
1.13. Con: The most essential element of any prison system is that the convicted criminal is removed from society while they serve their time. As a result, it is not possible to construct a system that does not primarily focus on punishment.
1.13.1. Pro: Rehabilitation is for healthcare systems, whereas prison is only a holding area within which we keep dangerous persons safely separated from the general populace. If a person is in need of rehabilitation rather than imprisonment, that should be done in the context of the healthcare system. A better hierarchy would be one that effectively utilises outpatient, inpatient, and long term mental health providers prior to the need for imprisonment.
1.13.1.1. Con: The healthcare system needs a large degree of reform before this is feasible.
1.13.1.2. Con: If we only send criminals we think have no chance of being reformed to prison, and everyone knows this is the case, in the case where we are wrong, the person will probably feel as though they are hopeless, which could lead to self harm, or an identity with the idea of them being irredeemably evil, and become much worse.
1.13.1.3. Con: If we only send criminals we think have no chance of being reformed to prison, and everyone knows this is the case, people we send to prison may not be able to reintegrate into society at all, having been eternally marked as irredeemable.
1.13.1.4. Con: If we only send criminals we think have no chance of being reformed to prison, and everyone knows this is the case, the people responsible for caring for the prisoners may be prone to mistreat them, as they have been very neatly branded as unchangeable.
1.13.1.5. Con: Working with rehabilitation requires specialized skills. Having this work done in separate institutions makes sense, both with respect to security and to create a professional environment. In the Nordic countries, these institutions are called prisons.
1.13.2. Con: Prison is not a poor setting for all types of rehabilitation. Gaining marketable skills, practising positive behaviours, can be conducted well in a prison context.
1.13.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.5.6.2.2.2.2.2.
1.13.2.2. Con: By definition, prisons are filled with criminals, making it extremely difficult to turn prisons into positively-minded, benevolent rehabilitation centers.
1.13.2.2.1. Con: By definition, a criminal is someone who has committed a crime in the past. This does not speak to the present mind-state of an incarcerated person.
1.13.2.3. Pro: Criminal rehabilitation can be administered as a form of therapy, as it is in Norway and elsewhere.  Therapy is not in itself a punishment, and even when it's court-ordered and enforced, that doesn't have to make it unpleasant.
1.13.2.4. Pro: Rehabilitation and separation from society are not mutually exclusive concepts.
1.13.2.5. Pro: Just because punishment is an inescapable element of a prison system doesn't mean it should/must be its primary focus.
1.13.2.6. Con: Having a marketable skill is not enough. People need to learn to market their skills. This requires social interaction.
1.13.2.6.1. Con: Sure enough, and one needs experience in workplace behaviour, and similar skills - but one has to start somewhere, with something.
1.13.2.7. Pro: At least for those who turned to crime due to lack of education, bad environment and poverty, this can be a way out of the circle. There are enough success stories of this kind to prove that at least sometimes, this happens.
1.13.3. Pro: Rehabilitation is a worthy goal, but prison is a poor setting for it. It is difficult for offenders to observe and practice positive interaction with society when they are isolated from society in a concentrated population of offenders.
1.13.4. Con: This assumes that being jailed feels like punishment for the prisoner. Some inmates find prison life to be better than life outside of it. They are guaranteed food and a bed, can get medical treatment they couldn't afford alone, and have regular, structured schedules.  Depending on where they grew up, they may have friends and family imprisoned at the same time and place. For some[thespec.com](https://www.thespec.com/news-story/4425874-choosing-prison-why-life-behind-bars-seems-better-than-freedom) people, prison isn't a painful removal, it's a more stable, familiar place than home.
1.13.5. Con: Having an element of punishment is not a reason to no longer pursue rehabilitation as primary focus.
1.13.6. Pro: Punishment is the act of removing them from society. That is their punishment. Rehabilitation can be offered, but not forced against a person's will to follow laws or not. It is up to the person if they want to be offered rehabilitation programs or not.
1.13.7. Con: Unless you lock people up until they are no longer capable of performing crime, punishment is simply paying to postpone the problem.
1.13.7.1. Pro: "Serving time" wouldn't need to be a thing in a system that truly focuses on rehabilitation. It would be rehabilitation focused, meaning that whenever a team of doctors/therapists have deemed the person well enough to leave the care facility and return to a normal life, they may.
1.13.7.2. Con: This assumes that person who commits a crime is a "criminal", as opposed to the act being criminal.
Yes, some people offend multiple times, but not all.
1.13.8. Con: To state that it is somehow impossible to construct a system without punishment is obviously untrue; we have plenty of evidence from other countries who have successfully managed it.
1.13.9. Pro: Punishment is an intrinsic part of the prison system; however, rehabilitation and reintegration should still be attempted. Those in prison for drug-related crimes, for example, need help: addiction is a chronic illness like any other, and so should not be discriminated against.
1.13.10. Con: Being separated from society does not necessarily indicate punishment, e.g. boarding schools, communes, living "off the grid".
1.13.10.1. Con: Separation, in the context of prison, has to do with forcible excision from society, not voluntary. At any point, someone who lives in a boarding school, commune, drug rehab, or "off the grid" establishment can return to society. Not so for a prisoner. The forced separation is the punishment.
1.13.10.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.4.1.
1.13.10.2. Pro: Mental hospitals, retreats, monasteries and others all separate people from society as well; and yet, they are not only not punishments, they are highly valued by many.
1.13.10.2.1. Con: A key difference may lie in whether the subject who is being removed from society has any control over it. People go to monasteries voluntarily, in most cases.
1.13.10.2.2. Pro: Drug rehab, mental institutions and hospitals all separate and isolate people for their and the public's good. They're isolated so they can be treated and rehabilitated without bringing further harm to the public or themselves.
1.13.10.3. Pro: Separation from society is only punishment if performed in the spirit of punishment. 'Punishment' is a specific type of negative intervention designed to give a wrongdoer what they 'deserve'. Whilst elements of prison will be unpleasant for a convict - including their being removed from society, and going through rehabilitation - to make the automatic assumption that this is a 'punishment' is a fallacy.
1.13.10.3.1. Con: Humans are ultimately primates \(homo sapiens\), largely reliant on their social groups: removing humans from their social context is proven to be psychologically damaging - and the further from society we are, the more unhealthy we will be. Prisoners become ostracised and isolated from their learned society, and rehabilitation is needed if they are to return to normal society outside the microcosm of prison.
1.13.10.3.1.1. Con: A rehabilitative model would be one in which prisoners experience a healthy version of society, because it is potentially likely that they committed their crime because they were in a toxic environment.
1.13.10.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.
1.13.10.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.4.
1.13.10.3.1.3. Con: The fact that a complete isolation of the individual is psychologically damaging doesn't imply that simply being in prison \(which is, in a way, a society inside another society\) is necessarily damaging too, especially since inmates also have a social group. The social group being smaller can, in some cases, create a deeper bond between those who belong to it.
1.13.10.4. Pro: This assumes that removal from society is a punishment, and, more importantly, that prison is not a part of society. Many prisoners find prison to be an ideal escape from their inability to interact with "normal society". Prison is, contrarily, a very visible component of society, and former convicts re-enter the public with the lessons learned in them.
1.13.10.5. Pro: Removal from society is not an end in itself, nor a 'punishment' per se. It is, purportedly, a means to achieving the end of preventing further criminal activity, which it accomplishes only in the short term.
1.13.11. Con: The only thing that is essential about prison is its place in the social contract, our tacit agreement as citizens that it is the thing that happens when you are convicted of a crime. How it is designed and how we use it as a society is an open question.
1.13.11.1. Pro: Even if there was no precedent for success in changing the prison system, there is no reason not to try. Success would benefit everybody enormously.
1.14. Con: As rehabilitation is harder to objectively measure than a reasoned length of punishment, it is necessary to focus primarily on the more concrete concept, i.e. punishment.
1.14.1. Pro: Rehabilitation will not necessarily work for everyone and can be problematic in practice.
1.14.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.
1.14.1.2. Con: Few things are ever 100% effective in social policy. If rehabilitation is comparatively more effective than the alternatives, then it is the desirable behavior.
1.14.1.3. Con: Neither will punishment. In the cases where people had fall-backs after their release from prison, you could have added a 300 times more severe punishment, the effect would have been no better. It's the \(if even at all tried\) rehabilitation that was not intense enough in those cases.
1.14.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.2.2.
1.14.1.5. Pro: Rehabilitation is inherently flawed. Rehabilitation is literally defined as making a person into a better, less flawed version of themselves. The problem here is that the definition of "less flawed" is inherently relative. For example, if a rehabilitation center is run by white racists, the person has a much higher possibility of leaving the rehabilitation center as a white racist or take in some of the ideas.
1.14.2. Pro: Rehabilitation can be faked, while serving a period of time in holding cannot.
1.14.2.1. Con: Feeling punished can be faked. If you want to compare the effectivity of punishment and rehabilitation you should measure them by the same standards.
1.14.2.2. Con: Serving time in a rehabilitation facility can be measured.
1.14.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.8.1.1.
1.14.4. Pro: A prioritisation of punishment ensures that equality of law is provided - individuals receive a punishment based on known sentencing principles, rather than abstract ideas such as measuring what constitutes rehabilitation.
1.14.4.1. Pro: Focusing on punishment suggests natural limits on what is a fair or proportional punishment, whereas focusing on rehabilitation potentially allows for unlimited sentences in the name of uncertainty that the criminal is really rehabilitated.
1.14.4.1.1. Con: By extension, punishment without rehabilitation is assumed to not reform criminals whatsoever. This means that, by prioritising punishment, we are certain to release high-risk prisoners into society, which is extremely dangerous.
1.14.4.1.2. Con: The system suggested works in both ways: it could conceivably lengthen some people's sentences, but it could considerably shorten the sentence of others.
1.14.4.1.3. Con: We can craft our system to protect the rights of criminals while still focusing on reform.
1.14.4.1.4. Pro: People who engage technically criminal activity, with a social and/or moral agenda rather than criminal intent, could be held for with a clear conscience could be held for exceptionally long periods because they have not "reformed" \(since they still feel what they have done is morally acceptable\).
1.14.4.1.4.1. Con: If society agrees that the act is justified, then the person is already reformed, and need not be detained, if society disagrees then the person is generally insane, and almost certainly a threat to themselves or others.
1.14.4.2. Con: We can, and probably should, use the same standard range of punishments for all cases if we focus on reform.
1.14.4.3. Pro: Parole hearings measure the assumed extent of "rehabilitation" and people can receive shorter sentences for perceived "good behavior." Two people that committed the same crime may have different sentence period because one was better rehabilitated than the other.
1.14.4.4. Con: Prioritizing punishment ensures equality among people who commit the same crime, but inequality among people who have the same potential for rehabilitation.
1.14.5. Con: That rehabilitation is harder to objectively measure is not an argument against its use, only a commentary on the difficulty of its implementation.
1.14.6. Pro: The only objective standards are how this helps correct the crime \(e.g. repaying victims and fixing damage to society,\) and how effectively it prevents future crime. 

Comparing best possible punishment/rehabilitation: punishment repays the wronged party while providing at least partial disincentive, while rehabilitation is better at preventing future crime but fails entirely at repayment or repair.

Pure Punishment \> Pure Rehabilitation, though the best possible answer is likely in between.
1.14.6.1. Con: Punishment by imprisonment does not repay the wronged party unless the wronged party is a sadist. In a modern society, the wronged party should care that their attacker was rehabilitated and will not hurt anyone else in the future.
1.14.7. Con: Rehabilitation is only harder to objectively measure when it is measured by its effectiveness, which sentence lengths are not. If we measured punishment by the reduced probability of reoffending, it would be just as hard to measure.
1.15. Con: Rehabilitation is just a nice word for punishment. Punishment takes the offender as a subject taking responsibility for his actions. Rehabilitation makes him or her an object for correction. Rehabilition sounds more humane but is more invasive.
1.15.1. Con: Rehabilitation in the context of prison means making more options available to the prisoner, options that would invariably make them more prepared for the outside world \(education, drug treatment, vocational training, etc\). This doesn't have to be forced upon them. Those who opt out of such programs are welcome to receive "standard punitive incarceration".
1.15.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.5.1.
1.15.3. Con: Both act upon the subject, but objective of this action is strongly different. Punishment seeks to inflict pain \(physical, emotional, moral\), rehabilitation seeks to make the subject capable of a normal social life.
1.15.3.1. Con: Punishment can make a person receptive to rehabilitation where they might not otherwise be so.
1.15.4. Con: Rehabilitation is more invasive but that's how change is made. Punishment doesn't foster anything other than resentment for the source of punishment.
1.15.5. Con: They committed the crime so they have to face the consequences, therefore they should be forced into rehabilitation.
1.15.5.1. Con: This is an appeal to the idea that certain consequences are deserved: an idea that ultimately supports prisons being instruments of punishment, rather than rehabilitation.
1.15.5.1.1. Con: What is said is not that some consequences are not deserved, but that inflicting arbitrary consequences such as imprisonment has no real effect and rehabilitation would thus be a better idea.
