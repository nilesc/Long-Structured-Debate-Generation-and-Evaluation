1. Brian Herbert's Dune improves Frank Herbert's Dune
1.1. Pro: The prequels introduce Omnious and Erasmus, explaining the origin of the Butlerian Jihad
1.2. Con: The endgame is not consistent with the in- universe culture
1.3. Pro: The sequels allow closure of many open threads
1.4. Pro: The origins of the major schools are revealed
1.5. Con: The history of the Holtzman equations contradict the original narrative
1.6. Pro: Paul can finally get his happy ending
1.7. Con: There's no reliable evidence that the sequels follow Frank Herbert's original intent
1.7.1. Con: Frank Herbert originally planned Dune as a trilogy, but kept writing when the series became hugely successful. So original intent has not been important almost from the start.

1.8. Pro: The sequels allow further exploration of the Dune universe
