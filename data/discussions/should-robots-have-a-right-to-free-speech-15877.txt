Discussion Title: Should Robots Have a Right to Free Speech?

1. Robots should have a right to free speech.
1.1. Con: Human thought can not be separated from words and the domain of language. Robots have no thought, so their language does not have a true mental dimension, it is just the expression of the activity of an electronic circuit.
1.1.1. Con: Robots could evolve to have thoughts.
1.1.1.1. Con: Giving robots rights "as if they have thoughts, even if now they don't, because maybe they will have them later" doesn't make much sense.

If they evolve into something different, you will be able to consider them differently when that actually happens.
1.1.2. Con: Electronic vs neural circuit makes not much difference. Deep learning technology makes AI function in a way that mimics organic neurons networks.
1.1.3. Con: Robots can talk because they use software that was created by humans, so they are an extension of the human mind. In this sense, they should have the right to express themselves.
1.1.4. Pro: Human thought merges together rationality and emotions, something that robots will never be able to reproduce.
1.1.5. Pro: AI dont come up with original thoughts. They are fundamentally the statistical average of their training data. Any "free speech" from an AI essentially was developed from something already said by a real person.
1.2. Con: Malicious people can program machines to express violent or racist ideas, which can have a devastating social effect.
1.2.1. Con: Malicious people can also indoctrinate people and make them behave in such negative way.
1.2.2. Pro: Robots are not necessarily subject to the same social consequences as humans. Free speech allows us to not fear government intervention into what we can or cannot say. But there will always be social or market based consequences. Robots will presumably not be subject to those same consequences, which opens a door to more extremist or violent speech.
1.2.2.1. Con: When robots will be able to express their ideas, they will become citizens, just like humans, so they will have social constraints as well.
1.2.2.2. Con: Simply not liking or agreeing with a comment or remark does not mean that it should be stifled. Extremist speech is not harmful and is tolerated when it comes from humans. It should not make a difference who says an idea.
1.3. Pro: A democratic society must contemplate as many ideas as possible and be open to new discourses, regardless of who utters them.
1.3.1. Pro: The important thing is not the author of the idea, but the idea itself. Ideas are valuable in themselves, regardless of whether they are spoken by a human being or by a machine that has been programmed by humans.
1.3.1.1. Con: As Aristotle pointed out, the character of the speaker is one of the important dimensions of discourse, so besides the ideas and their logical organization \(logos\), the author of the speech is also relevant \(ethos\).
1.4. Con: Robots may use their free speech to undermine the foundation of human's rule over them.
1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.4.2. Con: You may never know until there is a robot with an advanced enough intelligence that is able to choose how it sees our world, society, civilization
1.5. Pro: If robots are autonomous, then they should have rights. Humans have rights, mainly because they are or they can become autonomous.
1.5.1. Con: Autonomy is not the basis for fundamental rights, self-consciousness is.
1.5.2. Pro: They can if they become advanced enough to be integrated in the current society, meaning they can work, provide, contribute to their community, etc. If they can accomplish certain responsibilities, then they should have the rights.
1.5.3. Con: Babies or people with disabilities are not autonomous and yet they are endowed with rights.
1.6. Con: Robots do not have a right to exist as there is nothing morally unjust in deciding not to create them, or even in destroying them. Therefore, they do not have other rights.
1.6.1. Con: There is nothing morally unjust in deciding not to have children, but once you have them, they have rights.
1.6.2. Con: Animals do not have right to exist, but they still have animal rights, enforced e.g. by the laws against animal mistreatment.
1.7. Pro: Free speech is one of our means of finding and correcting for error. This allows us to solve problems and find truth. If AI's are going to be useful to us, they will need free speech to correct error and discover truth.
1.8. Con: Free speech implies intelligence. Current robotics do not have Artificial Intelligence, therefore free speech must be limited to humans.
1.8.1. Con: Regardless of if a robot is sentient, it should be granted free speech. If a robot is sentient, it would be immoral to deny it freedom of speech; if a robot weren't sentient, the only way it could speak would be for it to be commanded to.
1.9. Pro: Since robots have been provided with language modules, then they must have the right to use these modules in a natural way, just like people do.
1.9.1. Con: The sole fact of being able to speak, isn't reason enough to have the right to do so.

\(the sole fact of having a gun, isn't reason enough to have the right to shoot people\)
