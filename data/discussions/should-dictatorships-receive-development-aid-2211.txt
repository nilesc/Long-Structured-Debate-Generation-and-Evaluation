Discussion Title: Should Dictatorships Receive Development Aid?

1. Democracies should only provide official development assistance \([ODA](http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm#Definition)\) to democratic countries.
1.1. Pro: Making assistance conditional on democratisation makes economic reform and growth in non-democratic states more likely.
1.1.1. Pro: Unconditional aid creates perverse incentives for governments that ultimately harm their economies and populations.
1.1.1.1. Pro: By relieving immediate shortages, especially of consumer goods, aid allows governments to hide the worst excesses of their economic policy from their populations.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Unconditional aid acts as an insurance policy for the political leadership, where they don't need to enact sustainable economic policy as the aid provides them with the funds they need. This is especially worse when these states have harmful economic polices in place.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: In 1975–79, seventeen African countries received development aid worth over 10 percent of their GNP. Within the period 1980–89, the number of African countries in this category rose to twenty-five. During 1990–97, there were thirty-one African aid recipients whose development aid averaged more than 10 percent of GNP \([Goldsmith, p. 125](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4770683_Foreign_Aid_and_Statehood_in_Africa)\). This indicates a clear rise in aid dependency, where states continue to rely on aid rather than effect domestic change.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The thirty-one African aid recipient states during the period of 1990-1997 constituted 365 million people, or close to two-thirds of the then sub-Saharan population \([Goldsmith, p. 125](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4770683_Foreign_Aid_and_Statehood_in_Africa)\).
1.1.1.2.2. Con: This assumes that recipient states always prefer the status quo. It is possible to take local ownership of reform, where recipient states prefer reform for their own reasons.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Aid allows regimes to pursue economic policies which make the country more, rather than less, dependent on western aid: subsidised import substitution, forced collectivisation, inappropriate agricultural price policies, and inflationary financial policies, all of which increase the demand of imports while decreasing the ability to pay for them \([Bauer & Yamey, p. 310](http://faculty.nps.edu/relooney/BauerYameyAid.pdf)\).
1.1.1.2.4. Pro: Aid allows regimes to pursue policies which retard growth: persecuting productive members of society, especially minorities; restraining activities of traders, restricting inflow of capital, enterprise, and skill; forced purchase of private industries; and general policies which prevent domestic mobility, thereby preventing the exchange of ideas and methods \([Bauer & Yamey, p. 306](http://faculty.nps.edu/relooney/BauerYameyAid.pdf)\).
1.1.1.2.5. Pro: Governments are more likely to tolerate corrupt or ineffective internal revenue collection systems because foreign aid acts as a substitute to taxation revenue. Low income countries, which receive more aid on average, tend to see declining tax revenues \([Brautigum, p.264](https://deborahbrautigam.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/2004-foreign-aid-institutions-and-governance-in-subsaharan-africa.pdf)\).
1.1.1.2.5.1. Pro: When revenue does not depend on the taxes collected from people, states have little reason to be held accountable to them.
1.1.1.2.5.2. Pro: When states receive an unearned source of income through foreign aid, they have no need to develop the organisational capacity to raise revenue through direct taxation. As a result, the civil tradition of providing services in return for taxes is never established, stifling effective and responsive government.
1.1.1.2.6. Pro: The thought of being saved by foreign aid reduces the pressure, and perhaps the ability, to adjust to changes and shocks in the economic system.
1.1.1.2.6.1. Pro: Governments, especially in times of economic crisis, don't need to calculate strict budgets, as they know that foreign aid will simply plug any deficits. Annual budgets in many developing countries are already a 'deceptive mirage' \([Pradhan, p.110](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/509221468740209997/pdf/multi-page.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3. Pro: Economic reform often comes at a cost to the political leadership of a nation. Unconditional aid reduces the incentive of these politicians to engage in reform, worsening the collective action problem.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: The benefits of economic liberalisation take time to emerge, yet the costs to those invested in closed economies is immediate \([Schamis, p. 4](https://kellogg.nd.edu/publications/workingpapers/WPS/250.pdf)\). Entrenched political elites will only carry out reforms when the cushion unconditional foreign aid provides is taken away.
1.1.1.3.2. Pro: Recipient states today will accept aid, even though this aid will create problems for future governments who will not be able to pay off the debts incurred. Only by forcing states to use aid given to democratise will change occur.
1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Citizens will often have little understanding or knowledge of the total foreign aid being accepted by the state, limiting the extent to which governments can be held accountable.
1.1.1.4. Pro: It is necessary for governments to impose taxes and provide services in return for those taxes in order to create the reciprocal relationship between state and people necessary for the maintenance of a healthy civil society. The provision of unconditional aid removes the need for states to impose these taxes.
1.1.1.5. Pro: The private sector is often the [driver](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sonew032212a) of economic growth. However, non-democratic states, when given aid, don't see the need to invest in the private sector as aid simply substitutes the funds the state would have gained from investing in the private sector. \([Brautigam, p. 256](https://deborahbrautigam.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/2004-foreign-aid-institutions-and-governance-in-subsaharan-africa.pdf)\).
1.1.2. Con: Democratisation will not necessarily help these countries or their economies develop, and may make them worse.
1.1.2.1. Pro: In states in which natural resources are a large share of the economy - which applies to many developing countries - autocracy often [conduces more economic growth](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2007/05/01/survival-of-the-fattest/) because they make better long-term investments with those resources, while democracies are beholden to short-term electoral motives.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Enforcing democracy ignores other forms of government that can equally or better facilitate development.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: There is [not a single example](https://defence.pk/pdf/threads/comparing-democracy-and-dictatorship-performance-in-pakistan.318856/) of a developing country that turned into a developed country as a democracy since World War II. Economic growths under dictators in Asia led to rapid economic growth, compared to historically slower growth under European and North American democracies.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: According to the [World Bank's criteria](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/site-content/OGHIST.xls), countries classified as flawed democracies such as Guyana were able to move from being a "low income" country in 1990 to being an "upper middle income" country today.
1.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: In Pakistan, dictators have provided [better economic results](https://tribune.com.pk/story/335898/pakistans-economy--between-autocracy-and-democracy/) than civilian governments. Dictators led to a higher average growth rate, faster increase in the industrial sector, and more efficient state apparatus'.
1.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: South Korea turned from one of the world's [poorest nations](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/koreas-path-from-poverty-to-philanthropy/) after the end of the Korean War in 1953 into one of the world's richest nations within six decades. The years with the highest [economic growth rates](https://tradingeconomics.com/south-korea/gdp-growth-annual) and the highest [influx of development aid](https://poldev.revues.org/1535) took place under non-democratic rule.
1.1.2.2.1.3.1. Con: Just because the years in which aid was highest happened to correspond with the years of greatest economic growth does not mean aid lead to growth.
1.1.2.2.1.3.2. Pro: Especially among those who lived through these times, the then-dictator of South Korea, Park Chung-hee, [remains popular](http://newamericamedia.org/2013/03/why-late-south-korean-dictator-park-chung-hee-is-the-most-popular-president-ever.php). This appeal is seen as [part of the reason](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/19/park-geun-hye-south-korea-election) why his daughter was elected President in 2012.
1.1.2.2.1.4. Pro: Three quarters of the global reduction in poverty since 1980 was achieved by the People's Republic of China through largely undemocratic means. The benefits of its economic growth have [trickled](http://blogs.worldbank.org/eastasiapacific/ending-poverty-in-china-what-explains-great-poverty-reduction-and-a-simultaneous-increase-in-inequality-in-rural-areas) all the way down; some [680 Million people](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21578665-nearly-1-billion-people-have-been-taken-out-extreme-poverty-20-years-world-should-aim) had risen out of poverty by 2010. This indicates that a non-democratic environment can be conducive to rapid development.
1.1.2.2.1.4.1. Con: Deng Xiaoping, the former Premier of China, famously instructed '[let some people get rich first](http://www.economist.com/node/639652)'. The Chinese growth model has led to alarmingly high rates of income inequality.
1.1.2.2.1.5. Pro: Authoritarian regimes are more likely to successfully enforce unpopular but required measures which foster development \([Samarasinghe, p. 19](https://de.scribd.com/document/88608861/Democracy-and-Democratization-in-Developing-Countries-Samarasinghe)\).
1.1.2.2.1.5.1. Pro: Arguably the most successful model for development has been the [developmental state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_state) in countries such as China, South Korea and Singapore. It relies on a strong, at times non-democratic, state for economic organization.
1.1.2.2.1.5.1.1. Con: This model has been tied up with and partially been a result of the specific geopolitical context at the time: the Cold War with its great power competition. Thus, the developmental state is of questionable value for arguments outside this particular context \([Pempel, p. 137f.](https://books.google.de/books?id=cwP7VmRAq7cC&pg=PA137&lpg=PA137&dq=The+developmental+regime+in+a+changing+world+economy&source=bl&ots=O2cIXGv8w4&sig=JNPM6Dp1fIAn_2WgyN_gvDSKbDg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlsbnJmpfVAhXLthQKHfAKAn4Q6AEIMjAB#v=onepage&q=The%20developmental%20regime%20in%20a%20changing%20world%20economy&f=false)\).
1.1.2.2.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: South Korea and Taiwan \(as well as Japan and Vietnam\) received large amounts of US aid as well as preferential trade access to be built up as bulwarks against the further spread of Communism in East Asia, especially from the Soviet Union, China and North Korea \([Berger/Borer, p. 6f.](https://books.google.de/books?id=Nn-FAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=south+korea+taiwan+aid+US+cold+war&source=bl&ots=1QKssg8Nlb&sig=yaulyqwowIfWFyGkBd7ihgoK450&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjW_qfN4aPVAhXHbxQKHRh_CigQ6AEISzAF#v=onepage&q=south%20korea%20taiwan%20aid%20US%20cold%20war&f=false)\). These conditions are unlikely to replicate themselves again.
1.1.2.2.1.5.1.2. Pro: Leaders can better effect long-term change when they aren't beholden to short-term electoral interests. In Singapore, [Lee Kuan Yew's assured authority](http://thediplomat.com/2015/04/lee-kuan-yews-enduring-legacy/) gave him the leeway to embark on long-term projects for infrastructure and social development.
1.1.2.2.1.5.2. Con: However, reality tells a different story: instead of creating strong and innovative economies, authoritarian regimes tend to develop [energy dependencies](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/why-natural-resources-are-a-curse-on-developing-countries-and-how-to-fix-it/256508/), with fossil fuels as their most important export products.
1.1.2.2.1.6. Con: Just because no persistently democratic country has yet transitioned from developing to developed country does not mean that democracy cannot deliver development.
1.1.2.2.1.6.1. Pro: India has been democratic ever since 1951, has experienced economic growth of [usually over 5%](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/gdp-growth-annual) during the past 25 years, and has reduced the share of those living at under 2$ a day [from 45% to 21%](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=IN) over the same period.
1.1.2.2.1.6.2. Pro: Since Indonesia's democratization around 1998, the country saw steady economic growth of [usually over 4%](https://tradingeconomics.com/indonesia/gdp-growth-annual) and a rapid reduction of the share of those who live at under 2$ per day [from 65% to 8%](http://data.worldbank.org/topic/poverty?locations=ID).
1.1.2.2.1.6.3. Con: The point is not that democracies do not lead to development, but rather that dictatorships lead to faster development.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.5.1.
1.1.2.2.3. Pro: The model of Western democracy is not universally suitable: it disregards local characteristics, and ultimately preferences. Therefore, democratization is unlikely to become a success.
1.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Societies with a collectivist culture are more likely to accept a high quality and non predatory autocracy: economically successful nations like China or Singapore have not transformed into democracies \([Gorodnichenko & Roland, p. 26](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~groland/pubs/gorrolpolculture03-05-2013.pdf)\).
1.1.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: Societies with a [collectivist culture](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/05/are-there-cultural-obstacles-to-democratisation/) value political stability \([Gorodnichenko & Roland, p. 25](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~groland/pubs/gorrolpolculture03-05-2013.pdf)\). If democracy is seen as a threat to political stability, these states are likely to reject aid conditional on democratization.
1.1.2.2.3.1.2. Pro: Compared to individualistic cultures, collectivist cultures tend to restrict individual liberties in favor of collective freedom.
1.1.2.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: The collective security provided from an autocratic criminal justice system [like Singapore's](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/03/25/critics-call-singapore-an-autocracy-but-i-never-felt-more-free-than-when-i-lived-there/?utm_term=.d9df6be6a021), that restricts individual liberties, can open up different freedoms, like the freedom to walk around at night without fearing for safety.
1.1.2.2.3.2. Pro: Several [democratization](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/11037173/Why-Western-democracy-can-never-work-in-the-Middle-East.html) attempts in [Middle Eastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East) countries failed and led to chaos in the region, mainly because local characteristics were not seriously taken into account.
1.1.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: Family, tribe, sect and personal friendships are perceived as fundamental and outplay the apparatus of the state. Therefore, democratic principles, as well as the [rule of law](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/11037173/Why-Western-democracy-can-never-work-in-the-Middle-East.html), are extremely hard to implement in those countries.
1.1.2.2.3.2.2. Pro: Self-interested economic policy, a poor understanding of the ethnic divide, a poor choice of interim leader and a sustained military campaign led to a failed democracy in Iraq [\(Zunes, 2007\)](http://fpif.org/iraq_the_failures_of_democratization/).
1.1.2.3. Pro: A survey of 18 studies brought no definite evidence for the thesis that democratization facilitates rapid economic growth; successful economic development appeared in democracies as well as non-democratic states \([Samarasinghe, p. 19](https://de.scribd.com/document/88608861/Democracy-and-Democratization-in-Developing-Countries-Samarasinghe)\)
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Political stability and effective government are more important than the form of government for a country's development - and, crucially, democracy does not necessarily further these goals \([Huntington, p. 1f.](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2126/files/huntington_political_order_changing_soc.pdf)\).
1.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: For Singapore's former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, a political system had to improve the standard of living for its people. Although not a democracy, Singapore delivered [rising incomes for the broad middle class, health, security, and economic opportunity](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/03/lee-kuan-yew-conundrum-democracy-singapore/388955/) without any of the gridlock that hampers states like the US.
1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Economist Paul Collier has [argued](https://oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/war-guns-and-votes-what-to-make-of-paul-colliers-latest-book/) that, in the world's poorest countries, democratisation increases violence and instability and fails to provide economic growth.
1.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.5.1.
1.1.3. Con: Foreign aid also involves providing policy advice and creating training and education programs; these can spread new ways of thinking about governing and management. Unconditional aid facilitates the spread of liberal ideas, especially within the political elite \([Goldsmith, p. 127](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4770683_Foreign_Aid_and_Statehood_in_Africa)\).
1.1.3.1. Con: The political elites in dictatorships benefit from the lack of democracy. It is highly unlikely that liberal ideas would ever be enough to convince them to give up those benefits.
1.1.3.2. Con: Liberal ideas and education take years to change dictatorships. If conditional aid can encourage dictatorships to democratise now, it is unfair to leave the population waiting years for liberal ideas to take hold.
1.1.3.3. Con: Economists such as Paul Krugman \(The return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008\) and Joseph Stiglitz \(Globalization and its Discontents 2002\) warn that the Bretton Woods system that foreign aid revolves around, largely serves to erode trade protections in developing countries. As a result, large international companies thrive at the expense of these societies' salaries, fiscal stability and sovereignty. This propels inequality.
1.1.4. Pro: The success of economy-promoting development assistance depends on productive relation- and partnerships on site \([Minoiu & Reddy, p. 17](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2009/wp09118.pdf)\). The [relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory) between democracies are generally better than those between democracies and non-democracies; promoting democracy therefore favors these important preconditions.
1.1.4.1. Con: The relationships that Western democracies have with democracies elsewhere in the world is not necessarily stronger than the relationships they have with dictatorships. Western democracies have helped to overthrow numerous democratically elected governments and have collaborated extremely effectively with many dictatorships.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: The US pursued a highly successful alliance with, and gave huge amounts of aid to, [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea–United_States_relations) during the period in which it was a dictatorship under Park Chung-hee.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: The US and the UK collaborated to facilitate the overthrow of the democratically elected [Mohammad Mossadegh](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup) in Iran in 1953.
1.1.4.1.3. Pro: The US backed the overthrow of the democratically elected [Salvador Allende](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/09/chile-coup-santiago-allende-social-democracy-september-11/) in Chile in 1973. His successor, Pinochet, was a dictator yet the US still backed him, pursuing a successful alliance and donating huge amounts of aid and support.
1.1.4.2. Pro: According to [Democratic Peace Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory), democracies develop a "mutual democratic pacifism" towards each other and do not engage in armed conflicts against each other.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: Yet democracies have engaged in war against each other.
1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Pakistan and India have [fought each other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_conflicts) in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999.
1.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia fought the [Yugoslav Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars) during the 1990s.
1.1.4.2.1.3. Pro: Ecuador and Peru, both democratic countries, fought each other during 1981, in what is known as the [Paquisha War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paquisha_War).
1.1.5. Con: The primary concern of rulers especially in non-democratic countries is often retaining power. The poor economic conditions that result from withholding aid are more likely to cause tightening of restrictions than expanding of freedoms.
1.1.6. Pro: Research has shown that the effectiveness of aid is contingent on the level of democracy in a host country \([Gillivray, p. 5](https://www.oecd.org/dev/34353462.pdf)\).
1.1.7. Con: There are indications that aid from donors free of strategic preoccupations has a higher probability to induce growth-enhancing economic reforms \([Minoiu & Reddy, p. 18](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2009/wp09118.pdf)\). Making democracy a condition can be regarded as such a strategic preoccupation.
1.1.8. Pro: Conditional aid enables governments to implement unpopular reforms without costly protests if the 'punishment' caused by the noncompliance - cutting of aid - is perceived as considerable \([Ramcharan, p. 22](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2002/wp02183.pdf)\).
1.1.8.1. Con: But the paper itself cautions that this logic applies only to cases in which the government is interested in reforms but prevented from implementing them due to the fear of public protest. In many developing countries this is probably not the case and the government's motivation the real issue \([Ramcharan, p. 22](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2002/wp02183.pdf)\).
1.1.8.2. Con: In many \(if not most\) non-democratic countries, civil society is weak and highly restricted, thus limiting the potential for civic mobilization and protests. The fear of protests is thus likely not to be an issue in many government decisions.
1.1.9. Pro: Successful compliance with conditions creates a trustable reputation; [trust is of high importance](http://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/charles-schwab-2017-nt/the-trust-economy/1290/) for businesses and attracts investors.
1.1.9.1. Pro: Democratic states, by virtue of applying their rules consistently and fairly, and maintaining law and order, attract more foreign investment, an important factor in sustainable economic growth \([World Bank, p. 4](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5980)\).
1.1.9.1.1. Pro: As the rule-of-law principle is a component of modern democracies, investments are safe and legal certainty is given.
1.1.9.1.2. Con: Democracies are not necessarily better than autocracies at maintaining law and order.
1.1.9.1.2.1. Pro: Elections often [lead to violence](http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/causes-of-conflict/Electing_Violence__The_Causes_of_Electoral_Violence_in_Afria/) in developing democracies, as shown by a study of electoral violence in Africa.
1.1.9.1.2.1.1. Pro: Even well-meaning democratic governments struggle to combat electoral violence without looking like they are interfering in the election.
1.1.9.1.2.1.2. Pro: The ruling party in a democracy has no incentive to prevent electoral violence, and may even participate in it, if it helps their position.
1.1.9.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The government of Papua New Guinea were accused of orchestrating [violence and chaos](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/30/papua-new-guinea-election-descends-into-chaos-amid-violence-and-claims-of-bribery) in the 2017 election, giving them cause to delay the vote and hold onto power.
1.1.9.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: During the 2013 election in Venezuela, supporters of Nicolás Maduro engaged in [violence and intimidation](http://world.time.com/2013/04/19/after-venezuelas-election-chavistas-and-the-opposition-ready-for-long-fight/) at polling stations; the government were accused of turning a blind eye to their supporters' actions.
1.1.9.1.2.1.3. Pro: Elections in developing countries often lead to accusations of rigging, which lead to violence and instability, lowering investor confidence.
1.1.9.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: [Post election violence](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8597211.stm) in Kenya in 2007 led to the deaths of 1300 people and displacement of tens of thousands of people, leading to an investigation by the ICC under charges of crimes against humanity. The violence was attributed to the incumbent having '[stolen](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/03/201333123153703492.html)' the election from the opposition.
1.1.9.1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: After the re-election of Kenyan Preident Uhuru Kenyatta, the opposition leader Raila Odinga rejected the result and accused Uhuru of rigging the election. This led to [violence](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/12/africa/kenya-elections-protests/index.html) and 24 deaths nationwide within a week.
1.1.9.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Accusations of [election rigging](https://www.ihs.com/country-industry-forecasting.html?id=1065992085) in Pakistan's 2013 elections led to hundreds of thousands of people marching on the capital, and staging a 120 day sit-in in front of the Parliament. This led to political instability, stifling economic progress \([Mamoon et al, p. 33](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316350753_Political_Instability_and_Lessons_for_Pakistan_Case_Study_of_2014_PTI_Sit_inProtests)\).
1.1.9.1.2.1.4. Pro: Elections become a focal point of violence as tensions between competing parties and factions rises. Rather than allowing for a smooth transition, elections can often lead to an increase in violence.
1.1.9.1.2.1.4.1. Pro: Over 100 people were [killed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/pakistan-election-violence-targets-both-secular-islamist-politicians/2013/05/07/c307eab4-b74f-11e2-b568-6917f6ac6d9d_story.html?utm_term=.67ed89c32766) in bomb blasts and shootings in Pakistan before the election of 2013 as Islamist militants signalled their opposition to democracy.
1.1.9.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: [Violence erupts during times of electoral reform](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/10/election-violence-a-good-sign-for-pakistans-democracy/); as quieter means of coercion - intimidation, negative campaigning, slander, fear creation - become illegal, parties turn to explicit violence in order to fight their opponents.
1.1.9.1.2.1.4.3. Pro: In India, 43 Muslims were [killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/07/india-elections-death-toll-43-attacks-muslims-assam) in just one province during the 2014 elections.
1.1.9.1.2.1.4.4. Pro: Even in Africa's most mature democracy, South Africa, political candidates were [assassinated](https://www.voanews.com/a/violence-plagues-south-africa-election-campaign/3439839.html) before the election of 2016.
1.1.9.1.2.2. Pro: Singapore is not a true democracy, yet it ranked in the [top 10](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-10-20/us-is-no-18-in-global-rule-of-law-ranking) countries in the global Rule of Law rankings in 2016, beating the USA and several European states.
1.1.9.1.2.2.1. Pro: The reason for [Singapore's](https://www.thoughtco.com/singapores-economic-development-1434565) remarkable economic development was the authoritarian introduction of severe and business-friendly laws that created reliable conditions for international investors.
1.1.9.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.2.
1.1.9.1.3. Con: Non-democratic states with a large enough pool of labour and a large internal market, such as China, attract considerable levels of investment. Investors are willing to provide investment in order to gain access to local goods and labour markets \([Root and Bonnett, p. 1000](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223674719_The_Comparative_Politics_of_Corruption_Accounting_for_the_East_Asian_Paradox_in_Empirical_Studies_of_Corruption_Growth_and_Investment)\).
1.1.9.2. Con: Non-democratic countries can equally gain trust by creating predictable and stable conditions.
1.1.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.2.1.
1.1.10. Con: Non-democratic rulers require some degree of support in order to maintain power and stability. They have a natural incentive to ensure economic growth, and would use aid to this end.
1.1.10.1. Pro: Non-democratic states such as Taiwan and South Korea witnessed strong economic growth and a reduction in income inequality during the 1960's and 70's because of paternalistic political rule, where the dictators derived political legitimacy from the economic well-being of its people \([Feng, p. 4](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/07_china_economy_wang.pdf)\).
1.1.10.1.1. Pro: These states notably expanded public education and health services. 'The youth of the region participated in the world’s greatest improvement in life expectancy and educational attainment' which 'contributed to a broad-based increase in labor productivity and in income enhancement' \([Feng, p. 4](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/07_china_economy_wang.pdf)\).
1.1.10.1.2. Con: Economic growth induces democratisation in the [long run](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/12/29/economic-development-promotes-democracy-but-theres-a-catch/?utm_term=.e337d7630ea4). While growth may be in the interest of the dictator, it spells bad news for his dynasty, as it makes the transition of power difficult, creating the circumstances for democracy to take root.
1.1.10.2. Con: Dictators rely on specific groups to keep them in power, not the economic well-being of their populace.
1.1.10.2.1. Pro: Dictators maintain control by consolidating an inner core bound to the regime by 'family, ethnic, and religious loyalties'. As can be seen in Saudi Arabia, only blood relatives of the King are allowed to occupy important positions in the state and military \([Quinlivan, p. 138](http://www.jonathanmpowell.com/uploads/2/9/9/2/2992308/quinlivan_1999is-_coup-proofing_in_the_middle_east.pdf)\).
1.1.10.2.2. Pro: Dictators create a parallel military force specifically designed to protect themselves and employing multiple security services to squash dissent and opposition. This requires large sums of money, so any revenue generated from economic growth is diverted to these groups. \([Quinlivian, p. 141, 148 and 153](http://www.jonathanmpowell.com/uploads/2/9/9/2/2992308/quinlivan_1999is-_coup-proofing_in_the_middle_east.pdf)\).
1.1.10.2.3. Pro: [Dictators buy off the military](http://www.newsweek.com/how-dictators-maintain-their-grip-power-68533) by making them a partner in the regime. The army is given special opportunities to make money and exploit resources. This ensures their assistance in times of popular unrest.
1.1.10.3. Con: During the 37 year rule of Robert Mugabe, the resource rich land of Zimbabwe has suffered through some of the [worst economic crises](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/02/economist-explains-20) in recent memory; in 2008, inflation hit 231,000,000%. Yet he plans on running for re-election as the country's president in 2018.
1.1.10.4. Pro: Dictatorships still require some level of public support, if only to prevent a mass uprising against them. Providing at least the bare necessities to people is in the vested interests of non-democratic rulers.
1.1.10.4.1. Con: Provision of bare necessities hardly counts as ensuring economic growth and raising the living standards of people.
1.1.10.5. Con: Dictators can derive popular legitimacy from sources other than economic stability.
1.1.10.5.1. Pro: Almost 20 million people, or 13.4% of the population, [live at or below the poverty line](http://www.newsweek.com/putin-presides-over-slide-poverty-442374) in Russia. Vladimir Putin does not rely on economic growth, [but foreign policy achievements](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/how-to-understand-putins-jaw-droppingly-high-approval-ratings/2016/03/05/17f5d8f2-d5ba-11e5-a65b-587e721fb231_story.html?utm_term=.3783172a7565), to maintain popular support for his regime.
1.1.10.5.1.1. Pro: Even at the height of Russia's [recession](http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/11/news/economy/russia-economy-recession-six-quarters/index.html), Vladimir Putin had an approval rating of [83%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/how-to-understand-putins-jaw-droppingly-high-approval-ratings/2016/03/05/17f5d8f2-d5ba-11e5-a65b-587e721fb231_story.html?utm_term=.9d58044ce75b).
1.1.10.5.2. Pro: North Korea is [one of the poorest nations in the world](https://borgenproject.org/poverty-in-north-korea/) and perhaps the [cruelest dictatorship in the world](http://www.economist.com/node/21560225), yet is also [stable](https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-regime-stable-says-former-intelligence-official/3326827.html) and unlikely to go anywhere any time soon. Part of this support stems from a [nationalist ideology](http://www.belfercenter.org/publication/keeping-kim-how-north-koreas-regime-stays-power), which is geared against Japan, South Korea and the USA.
1.1.10.5.3. Pro: The Chinese government derives legitimacy from playing up [nationalist narratives](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/nationalism-china) and portraying itself as "rejuvenating the Chinese nation".
1.1.10.5.3.1. Con: Studies imply that the Chinese middle class is not in favor of democratic reforms due to a general satisfaction with its social and economic situation and the dependence on the state apparatus \([Chen/Lu, p. 716](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/829a/11148c042ad2c20f2a0fe5f255984f9a704c.pdf)\).
1.1.10.5.3.1.1. Pro: Even [protesters](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/01/how-china-stays-stable-despite-500-protests-every-day/250940/) in China have relatively minor demands and often declare their loyalty to the Communist Party.
1.1.10.5.3.1.2. Pro: Young people often tend to be the most in favour of reform and change, yet even China's young people only [tentatively](https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/07/young-chinese-people-may-just-not-be-that-into-western-style-democracy/277885/) favour democracy, and think it should be tailored to China's interests and needs.
1.1.10.5.3.1.3. Con: A [study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10670560701562283) has argued that this may soon change drastically: 90% of Chinese people are already in favour of democracy and as time goes on, more and more of them see it as a priority.
1.1.10.5.3.1.4. Pro: Even the groups in China who are strongly in favour of democratic principles [oppose](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293015182_Who_Wants_Democracy_in_China_An_Empirical_Analysis_of_Chinese_Democratization_in_Perspective/fulltext/56c573e608aea564e304eb9f/293015182_Who_Wants_Democracy_in_China_An_Empirical_Analysis_of_Chinese_Democratization_in_Perspective.pdf) democratisation in the current context.
1.1.10.5.3.1.5. Con: China has only [recently](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/12/29/economic-development-promotes-democracy-but-theres-a-catch/?utm_term=.e337d7630ea4) entered the income range at which continued authoritarianism is surprising. It is still too early to say if China will be able to continue rapid economic growth and complete totalitarian rule.
1.1.10.6. Con: Economic growth [induces democratisation](https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/03/growth-0), so dictators have an incentive to keep their countries poor if they want to stay in power.
1.1.10.6.1. Pro: Economic growth leads to the rise of a middle class, which tends to demand democratisation. Autocratic leaders have an incentive to prevent such a class from growing large enough to be a threat to them.
1.1.10.6.1.1. Pro: Middle classes tend to [demand](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-02-15/middle-class-heroes) regulations, the fair enforcement of contracts, and the rule of law more generally—public goods that create a level social and economic playing field on which all can prosper. Arbitrary despotic rule often does not allow for this.
1.1.10.6.1.1.1. Pro: The middle class has a [strong incentive in ensuring good governance](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2011/12/07/10773/the-middle-class-grows-the-economy-not-the-rich-2/), as they depend on public services such as public schooling and transportation. A failure to invest in the middle class by non-democratic states will likely lead to calls for reform and better governance.
1.1.10.6.1.2. Pro: As the fortunes of the rising middle class in developing countries rise, their [demands](http://carnegieendowment.org/2017/08/25/uprising-of-global-middle-class-pub-72924) for more upward progress and better, often more representative, government puts pressure on autocratic regimes.
1.1.10.6.1.3. Pro: Middle classes have played a vital role in many states' recent processes of democratisation.
1.1.10.6.1.3.1. Pro: In [Kenya](http://democracyinafrica.org/rise-middle-class-good-democracy/), the middle class are more likely to hold democratic views than their less educated and poorer counterparts.
1.1.10.6.1.3.1.1. Pro: As many of these middle class members are in full time employment, often independent of the state, they are in a better position, and feel more [secure](http://democracyinafrica.org/rise-middle-class-good-democracy/), to argue for democracy than their unemployed, poorer counterparts.
1.1.10.6.1.3.2. Pro: Economic growth in Latin America created a burgeoning middle class which placed pressure on their regime to democratise; this was [crucial](https://europeanista.wordpress.com/2012/04/14/causes-of-the-third-wave-of-democratisation-in-diverse-latin-america/) for 'third wave' of democratisation in Latin America.
1.1.10.6.1.3.2.1. Con: The economic failure of many Latin American countries - oil shocks of the 1970s and the debt crisis of many of these states - was [more important](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/09/06/democracy-does-not-cause-growth/) for the wave of democratisation than economic growth. If anything, this region proves the converse, that economic growth is not needed for democratisation.
1.1.10.6.1.3.3. Pro: The middle class in many Arab countries have seen declining economic fortunes since the 1990s. The people who comprise this group - civil servants, lawyers, engineers and doctors - have begun to [mobilise](http://carnegie-mec.org/2011/11/02/middle-class-and-transformations-in-arab-world-pub-45895) over issues as simple as jobs and stable health and social protections. Such civil protest is crucial for democracy.
1.1.10.6.1.3.3.1. Pro: This economic dissatisfaction of the middle class eventually helped [fuel](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/10/21/middle-class-frustration-that-fueled-the-arab-spring) the Arab Spring.
1.1.10.6.1.3.3.2. Pro: The middle classes in Tunisia and Egypt disproportionately participated in their Arab Spring revolutions \([Beissinger et al. p. 2](http://www.princeton.edu/~mbeissin/beissinger.tunisiaegyptcoalitions.pdf)\).
1.1.10.6.1.3.4. Con: Members of middle classes don't always support democracy.
1.1.10.6.1.3.4.1. Pro: In a [survey](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/02/201222086791170.html) conducted in 2012, only 15% of Libyans wanted democracy.
1.1.10.6.1.3.4.1.1. Con: It is still possible that a disproportionate number of the middle classes are contained in that 15%.
1.1.10.6.1.3.4.2. Pro: The vast majority of people around the world care about the ability of their governments to “[deliver the goods](http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/03/11/studies-show-people-want-democracy-to-deliver-the-goods/),” namely in relation to economic development, employment, and essential public services such as health, education, and water and sanitation. Concerns of democracy and rights lag far behind.
1.1.10.6.1.3.4.2.1. Pro: If a non-democratic state can better meet the needs of the middle class, there is no reason why they would not choose that political system.
1.1.10.6.1.3.4.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.
1.1.10.6.1.3.4.3. Pro: In Egypt, Tunisia, and to an extent in Morocco as well, the emerging middle class suffers from divisions based on divergent religious and educational background: they [differ drastically](http://carnegie-mec.org/2012/12/25/middle-class-and-changing-arab-world-pub-50645) in their political and social visions. Not all members of the middle class want a democracy.
1.1.10.6.1.3.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.5.3.1.
1.1.10.6.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.10.6.1.3.4.
1.1.10.6.1.5. Con: 'Islamic fundamentalism' is a middle-class ideology. In Iran, Khomeini saw himself as the defender of the Iranian middle class; he had the strong support of the Shia clergy and the merchant class \([Kechichian, p. 104](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NpoYDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=arab+dictators+co+opted+middle+class&source=bl&ots=n_9UEDAFVD&sig=C1-ySU2-x8yDXNWgoJOyFpTAI1Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJ9KOPwLvWAhWMKcAKHemLBRAQ6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&q=arab%20dictators%20co%20opted%20middle%20class&f=false)\).
1.1.10.6.1.6. Con: Various factors determine middle class support for democratic revolutions: whether they have previously experienced democracy, the degree of distrust of American support for democratisation, and even the belief that they can co-opt a non-democratic revolution and dominate the future government. Middle class support for democracy is not set in stone \([Kechichian, p. 104](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NpoYDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=arab+dictators+co+opted+middle+class&source=bl&ots=n_9UEDAFVD&sig=C1-ySU2-x8yDXNWgoJOyFpTAI1Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJ9KOPwLvWAhWMKcAKHemLBRAQ6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&q=arab%20dictators%20co%20opted%20middle%20class&f=false)\).
1.1.10.6.2. Con: Economic growth does not necessarily result in calls for political reforms as long as the majority of people feel like they are profiting from this growth. Calls for political reforms rather depend on perceptions of inequality and unfairness.
1.1.10.6.2.1. Pro: If the middle class receives economic benefits from a non-democratic state, it is unlikely to call for democratic reform.
1.1.10.6.2.1.1. Pro: In Egypt, economic freedom created an alliance between the business class and the political elite, making it a democracy without freedom \([Chatterjee & Singh](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3Ea6DQAAQBAJ&pg=PT39&lpg=PT39&dq=middle+class+calls+for+democracy&source=bl&ots=EBAhmFjhGt&sig=A1HquRCAGQUwWBHMnDBLu1B42V0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjF2cv76LjWAhXBA8AKHb08DKkQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.1.10.6.2.1.2. Pro: If the middle class is a beneficiary of state-led development, it is less likely to initiate or support democratisation under authoritarian regimes \([Chen](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=onXtxUPdV_QC&pg=PP67&lpg=PP67&dq=when+have+middle+classes+supported+dictators&source=bl&ots=sI2-P1wPOB&sig=wQBVhkEF5R0BvjEiTE5LRrSnKKk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiFh76Ix7vWAhXrC8AKHaW-CgoQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&q=when%20have%20middle%20classes%20supported%20dictators&f=false)\). Rather, support for non-democratic regime increases, entrenching the power of existing regimes.
1.1.10.6.2.1.3. Pro: If a rise in standard of living of the middle class comes in the form of state employment, then they are more likely to support the government, regardless of its political nature \([Chen](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=onXtxUPdV_QC&pg=PP67&lpg=PP67&dq=when+have+middle+classes+supported+dictators&source=bl&ots=sI2-P1wPOB&sig=wQBVhkEF5R0BvjEiTE5LRrSnKKk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiFh76Ix7vWAhXrC8AKHaW-CgoQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&q=when%20have%20middle%20classes%20supported%20dictators&f=false)\).
1.1.10.6.2.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.10.6.1.
1.1.10.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.5.3.1.
1.1.10.6.2.3. Pro: A [primary reason](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/10/21/middle-class-frustration-that-fueled-the-arab-spring) for the Arab Spring is seen in the public dissatisfaction with inequality and the quality of life.
1.1.10.6.2.3.1. Pro: All major states of the Arab Spring - [Tunisia](https://tradingeconomics.com/tunisia/gdp-growth-annual), [Egypt](https://tradingeconomics.com/egypt/gdp-growth-annual), [Libya](https://tradingeconomics.com/libya/gdp-growth-annual), [Yemen](https://tradingeconomics.com/yemen/gdp-growth-annual), [Syria](https://tradingeconomics.com/syria/gdp-growth-annual) and [Bahrain](https://tradingeconomics.com/bahrain/gdp-growth-annual) - experienced steady and moderate economic growth of around 4% prior to the events of 2011.
1.1.10.6.2.4. Con: Yet often the gains of economic growth are not distributed equally amongst the populace.
1.1.10.6.2.4.1. Pro: Rapid economic growth is often accompanied by an increase in income inequality, as the products of the economic growth are concentrated in the hands of a few rather than the many. In such instances, economic growth does not lead to [happiness](https://hbr.org/2016/04/when-economic-growth-doesnt-make-countries-happier).
1.1.10.6.2.4.1.1. Pro: A comprehensive study of 73 countries reported that for the period of 1950 to 1995, in all but 9 countries inequality either increased \(in 48 countries\) or remained constant \(in 16 countries\). These 73 countries accounted for 80 percent of the world’s total population and 92 percent of the world’s GDP \([Feng, p. 5](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/07_china_economy_wang.pdf)\).
1.1.10.6.3. Con: Research suggests that it is in fact bad economic performance that catalyses the downfall of autocratic regimes \([Pozuelo, et al., p. 3](https://publications.iadb.org/bitstream/handle/11319/7758/Democracy-Does-Not-Cause-Growth-The-Importance-of-Endogeneity-Arguments.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)\).
1.1.10.6.3.1. Pro: Dictators [often fall](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150531-will-dictators-disappear) during bad economic times because "Your backers become nervous that you won’t be able to help them, so they start to shop around."
1.1.10.6.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.6.1.3.2.1.
1.1.10.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.2.
1.1.10.7. Con: Creating a suitable climate for foreign investment and growth requires the state to [limit its own discretionary powers](http://www.zdnet.com/article/why-economic-development-leads-to-democracy/) in order to ensure stability and consistency of economic practice - autocratic regimes will not want to do this.
1.1.11. Pro: The Development Assistance Committee \(DAC\) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \(OECD\) has stated: 'There is a vital connection between open, democratic and accountable systems of governance and respect for human rights, and the ability to achieve sustained economic and social development' \([DAC, p. 8](http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=OCDE/GD\(93\)191&docLanguage=En)\).
1.1.11.1. Pro: Foreign aid has a positive effect on growth when good economic policies are in place. If a state is unable to enact “good” fiscal, monetary and trade policies, foreign aid is of little use \([Burnside and Dollar, p. 3](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/698901468739531893/pdf/multi-page.pdf)\). A democratic environment is much more conducive to the formation of such policies.
1.1.11.1.1. Con: After expanding the data sample to include more countries and four more years of data, while maintaining Burnside and Dollar's methodology, researchers "no longer find that aid promotes growth in good policy environments." [\(Easterly et. al. 2004, p. 779.\)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3592954)
1.1.11.1.2. Pro: Democratization has positive effects on the national economy.
1.1.11.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.11.1.2.2. Pro: Out of 32 studies conducted on the relationship between democracy and economic growth, 29 found a positive, conditional or neutral correlation, and only 3 found a negative correlation \([Goldsmith, p. 135](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4770683_Foreign_Aid_and_Statehood_in_Africa)\).
1.1.11.1.2.3. Pro: The World Bank has called for due process in aid recipient countries in order to prevent arbitrary and opaque policy making, which it sees as sapping private-sector confidence. It finds that public accountability is beneficial for private sector growth. \([World Bank, p. 7](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/5977/WDR%201994%20-%20English.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y)\).
1.1.11.1.2.4. Pro: [Democracy](http://www.e-ir.info/2015/12/20/a-critical-analysis-of-the-relationship-between-democracy-and-corruption/), over time, can reduce corruption, thereby encouraging investment, increasing economic growth, and preventing misuse of government budgets \([IMF, p. 3/4](https://www.imf.org/EXTERNAL/PUBS/FT/ISSUES6/issue6.pdf)\).
1.1.11.1.2.4.1. Pro: Development aid does not go to the needy, but to the rulers, who allocate it according to their own personal vested interests. It is unlikely that the poorest will rank on the priority list of these rulers.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: [The African Union](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/foreign-policy/323198-trumps-suspicion-of-foreign-aid-to-africa-is-right-on-the) estimates that  '25 percent of the continent’s GDP \(nearly 150 billion dollars\) is lost due to corruption'.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.2. Pro: [$7.3 million of aid](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/world/africa/03zimbabwe.html) that was intended to fight AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in Zimbabwe was misappropriated by the government.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.3. Pro: Corrupt civil servants in [Tanzania](http://africanarguments.org/2011/03/01/why-foreign-aid-has-failed-to-lift-africa-out-of-poverty/) used aid money that was meant to build schools to pay themselves exorbitant salaries and buy expensive cars.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.4. Pro: In August 2012, [DfID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_International_Development) froze money to the Ugandan prime minister's office amid reports that [funds from several European countries](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/nov/16/uk-suspends-aid-uganda-misuse) had been funneled into the private bank accounts of officials in prime minister Patrick Amama Mbabazi's office.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.5. Pro: [Human Rights Watch](http://time.com/23075/william-easterly-stop-sending-aid-to-dictators/) reported that Ethiopia's ruling autocrat defrauded famine relief funds in favor of the ruling-party members.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.6. Pro: From 1965 to 1997, Zaire's president Mobutu Sese Seko is reputed to have stolen at least [$5 billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123758895999200083) worth of aid money from his country.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.7. Pro: In Nigeria, it is [estimated](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2387359/Nigeria-country-corrupt-better-burn-aid-money.html) that since 1960, all foreign aid received by the state, worth $380 billion USD, has been siphoned off.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.8. Pro: There exists a positive relationship between the extent of corruption that occurs within a state and the amount of foreign aid it receives. Foreign aid, when provided without conditions, either increases, or at best maintains, levels of corruption \([Alesina & Weder, p. 5](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4553011/alesina_corruptgovernments.pdf?sequence=2)\).
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.8.1. Pro: As aid is stolen in secret, recipient states use methods intended to deceive outside observers. It is '[inherently impossible](http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/politifact-paul-exaggerates-degree-of-foreign-aid-theft/2310252)' to determine how much aid is stolen.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.8.1.1. Pro: Even experts in the area say they simply [do not know](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/how-much-aid-really-lost-corruption) how much development aid money is lost to corruption.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.8.2. Pro: Where development aid increases corruption, the aid given does not reach those who truly need it. It would therefore be far better spent elsewhere.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.8.3. Pro: An independent report from the UK found that in some cases, corrupt practices were "perpetuated and not tackled" by government aid programmes \([ICAI, p. 31](http://icai.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/DFIDs-Approach-to-Anti-Corruption-and-its-Impact-on-the-Poor-FINAL.pdf)\)
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.9. Con: The majority of development aid is usually spent on specific approved projects; governments often cannot choose what to spend it on \([Jelovac and Vandeninden, p. 2](http://www.crepp.ulg.ac.be/papers/crepp-wp200804.pdf); [Carlin, p. 3](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2008/P3283.pdf)\).
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.9.1. Pro: Many donor states monitor their development projects to ensure that their money is being spent on its intended purpose.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.9.1.1. Pro: The European Union produces a [detailed report](https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sites/devco/files/europeaid-ar2016-en-ld.pdf) on the success of its global projects annually.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.9.1.2. Pro: Monitoring arrangements on development aid are [increasingly restrictive](http://www.abyrint.com/monitoring-primer/) and allow states a large amount of control over where their money is going.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.9.1.3. Pro: The World Trade Organisation carries out extensive monitoring on its [Aid for Trade](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/devel_e/a4t_e/aid4trade_e.htm) programmes.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.9.1.4. Con: Monitoring is likely far less effective in non-democratic states.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.9.1.4.1. Pro: Monitoring likely depends on the compliance of civil servants and local officials to report on the success of projects. These people can be bribed, or may be engaged in corruption themselves.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.9.1.4.2. Pro: Without a free press and accountability mechanisms, the population has no ability to report when aid projects are unsuccessful or when the money is not getting to them.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.9.2. Pro: The US typically provides aid through a [third party](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2005/05/do_governments_take_checks.html), either to peacekeeping forces or to independent contractors and consultants. Groups apply to the government for funding, and USAID then selects recipients for the aid.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.9.3. Con: 15% of the aid provided by the UK in 2013 was given directly to governments as '[budget support](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/mar/20/uk-aid-spend-important-works)', aimed at recipient states that weren't able to meet their budgets.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.10. Con: While corruption is a problem, all the available evidence suggests that a significant majority - more than 70% - of aid projects are able to [successfully deliver](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/how-much-aid-really-lost-corruption) on most of their intended outcomes.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.11. Con: -> See 1.1.10.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.12. Pro: Non-democratic regimes do not care about suffering people.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.12.1. Pro: Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has [refused to accept](http://venezuelatoday.net/venezuelan-government-continues-to-block-humanitarian-aid-efforts-that-could-save-lives-during-crisis/) even urgent humanitarian aid for fear of allowing it to undermine his power. Autocrats care far more about their own position than helping their people.
1.1.11.1.2.4.1.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.3.
1.1.11.1.2.4.2. Con: Yet countries such as Thailand and Indonesia have ranked amongst the fastest growing economies in the world while registering some of the [highest levels of corruption](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jii/4750978.0010.206/--corruption-southeast-asian-style-its-puzzlilng-connections?rgn=main;view=fulltext).
1.1.11.1.2.4.2.1. Con: The fact that these highly corrupt countries have quickly growing economies does not nullify that corruption is negative for economic development: those countries would have experienced faster development without corruption.
1.1.11.1.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: Experts in the region have [argued](http://asiahouse.org/corruption-lack-political-leadership-hampering-asean-economic-integration/) that corruption has stymied growth in Indonesia and Thailand, as well as hampering economic integration in the region.
1.1.11.1.2.4.3. Con: What discourages business investment is not corruption, but [unpredictability](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jii/4750978.0010.206/--corruption-southeast-asian-style-its-puzzlilng-connections?rgn=main;view=fulltext). If corruption is stable - whom to pay, how much, what they will deliver - investors can factor corruption into their calculus. When corruption becomes unpredictable, investment becomes moot.
1.1.11.1.2.4.3.1. Con: Corruption [fuels instability](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/tackle_instability_and_terrorism_by_fighting_corruption), which in turn destabilises the economy.
1.1.11.1.2.4.3.2. Con: Analysts at the World Bank have argued that corruption [creates uncertainty](http://blogs.worldbank.org/futuredevelopment/nine-reasons-why-corruption-destroyer-human-prosperity). It is an inherently unpredictable system.
1.1.11.1.2.4.3.3. Con: Corrupt agreements do not come with a guarantee; even though a bribe may have been paid, the bribee is under no obligation to actually carry out their part of the agreement. Instead, such agreements can lead to opportunism, where even more bribes may be demanded. This only causes inefficiency.
1.1.11.1.2.4.3.3.1. Con: Those who demand bribes have a clear incentive to carry out their part of the agreement: if they don't, no one in the future will pay them a bribe.
1.1.11.1.2.4.4. Pro: As the institutions of transparency and accountability in democracies mature, the cost of corruption - the probability of getting caught and punished - rises. As a result, overall corruption decreases.
1.1.11.1.2.4.5. Con: Corruption can act as a substitute for weak or misguided law, where investors pay a bribe to skirt around bureaucratic or legal restrictions. In other words, corruption can 'grease the wheels' for a developing but inefficient economy \([Houston, p. 326](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2007/11/cj27n3-2.pdf)\).
1.1.11.1.2.4.5.1. Pro: Corruption can help speed up the work of often rigid and slow-working bureaucracies, fostering growth where otherwise there may have been none. This can be seen in the 1870's and 1880's in the US, where corruption by railroad, utility and industrial corporations resulted in faster growth \([Huntington, p. 68/69](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2126/files/huntington_political_order_changing_soc.pdf)\).
1.1.11.1.2.4.5.2. Con: Civil servants set up additional layers of bureaucracy once they realise the gains to be made from corruption. While the speed of the first transaction may have increased because of corruption, the many additional transactions imposed because of that corruption offset any efficiency initially gained \([Jain, p. 92](http://darp.lse.ac.uk/PapersDB/Jain_\(JES01\).pdf)\).
1.1.11.1.2.4.5.3. Con: Corruption reinforces such restrictions: civil servants may cause delays that would not have occurred otherwise in order to extract bribes \([Meon & Sekkat, p. 73](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2126/files/meonsekkat_2006.pdf)\).
1.1.11.1.2.4.5.4. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.4.3.3.
1.1.11.1.2.4.6. Pro: Corruption distorts public expenditure allocation: 'bribe-maximizing politicians prefer to allocate resources to areas with the best opportunities to be bribed' and the least chance of getting caught. This often results in over-expenditure in areas of defence at the expense of education and health. \([Jajkowicz & Drobiszová, p. 1257](https://acta.mendelu.cz/media/pdf/actaun_2015063041251.pdf)\).
1.1.11.1.2.4.7. Pro: The best connected contractors or firms are preferred over those offering the best product in a corrupt state. This leads to increased inefficiencies in the economy.
1.1.11.1.2.4.7.1. Pro: An economic [study](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.524.3662&rep=rep1&type=pdf) of corruption in Latin America found a strong link between corruption and economic inefficiency in the private sector.
1.1.11.1.2.4.8. Pro: Public servants are appointed based on nepotism or bribe payments, rather than on their ability and skills. This leads to a worse civil service that further entrenches corruption.
1.1.11.1.2.4.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.4.5.2.
1.1.11.1.2.4.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.4.5.3.
1.1.11.1.2.4.9. Pro: As this study shows, there is a negative and highly significant impact of democracy on corruption \([Kolstad / Wiig, p.12](https://www.cmi.no/publications/file/4315-does-democracy-reduce-corruption.pdf)\).
1.1.11.1.2.4.10. Con: Corruption tends to increase in fledging democracies.
1.1.11.1.2.4.10.1. Pro: Young democracies do not have a robust set of checks and balances as institutions are just forming. Yet increased political access gives more people access to the dispensation of public funds, increasing the amount distributed through corrupt means. Democracy therefore increases corruption in the short term \([Mohtadi and Roe, p. 447](https://people.uwm.edu/mohtadi/files/2016/07/Mohtadi-Roe-Democracy-Corruption-Public-goods-growth-JPubE-2003-15k9b88.pdf)\).
1.1.11.1.2.4.10.2. Con: This may be because of increased visibility of corruption, rather than an increase in the levels of corruption taking place.
1.1.11.1.2.4.10.2.1. Con: The increase in levels of corruption after democratisation cannot entirely be attributed to previous corruption becoming visible; an increase in levels of corruption has been recorded in emerging democracies \([Mohtadi and Roe, p. 463](https://people.uwm.edu/mohtadi/files/2016/07/Mohtadi-Roe-Democracy-Corruption-Public-goods-growth-JPubE-2003-15k9b88.pdf)\).
1.1.11.1.2.4.10.3. Pro: Democratisation breaks up a centralised corruption network between the political, business and military leadership; in such a network, fewer people partake in corruption as power is centralised. Once it is broken up, far more people enter the political process, increasing the number of corrupt officials, thus increasing overall levels of corruption \([Rock, p. 3](http://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2007/wp55_2007.pdf)\).
1.1.11.1.2.4.10.4. Pro: Democratisation mandates elections, yet running for election requires vast sums of money. This leads to extortion of funds from the bureaucracy, private firms, and other institutions of the state, increasing levels of corruption \([Rock, p. 4](http://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2007/wp55_2007.pdf)\).
1.1.11.1.2.4.10.5. Con: Yet in the long term, as democracies mature, corruption decreases \([Rock, p. 16](http://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2007/wp55_2007.pdf)\).
1.1.11.1.2.4.10.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.4.4.
1.1.11.1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.
1.1.11.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.5.1.
1.1.11.2. Pro: The long-run growth impact of aid is conditional on the degree of political and civil liberties in the recipient country. Aid has a positive impact on growth in countries with an institutionalised check on governmental power, i.e. in more democratic countries. If these checks do not exist, aid will simply be used to further the regimes own personal goals. \([Svensson, p. 275](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4989895_Aid_Growth_and_Democracy)\).
1.1.11.3. Con: This statement should be taken with a grain of salt. All OECD DAC members are mature democracies, hence one would not expect them to state anything else that might question the role of democracy in development.
1.1.11.3.1. Con: Even though they would not question the importance of democracy, they did not need to explicitly endorse democracy as conducive to economic growth either.
1.1.12. Pro: Democratic institutions are a prerequisite to supporting basic human needs in the long term. Leaders will [provide public goods](http://www.cipe.org/publications/detail/how-democracy-influences-growth) essential for development like roads, hospitals, and schools if their power is electorally determined.
1.1.12.1. Pro: Even if an individual autocratic leader provides for the public interest, that leader cannot guarantee that future leaders will not be corrupt or cruel. Democracy is the only way to ensure long-term accountability to public needs.
1.2. Pro: Conditional development assistance works as an incentive for further democratization.
1.2.1. Con: Conditioning assistance on becoming democratic only encourages states to make surface-level reforms that appear democratic.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Pressure to democratise quickly will make non-democratic states call snap elections. These will be controlled, and [easily won](http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/faculty/mstohl/failed_states/1998/papers/sorensen.html), by the ruling regimes since opposition parties won't have time to mobilise and lobby for support. Such 'democratisation' only entrenches the power of the autocratic regimes.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Calling snap elections before parties have time to consolidate or armed movements have agreed to disarm lead to results which can be easily rejected by opposition groups. This risks further [destabilisation and violence](http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/faculty/mstohl/failed_states/1998/papers/sorensen.html), and is a setback for democratisation.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: In snap elections, when it is not clear who the parties are and what they stand for, people [default to voting along ethnic or religious lines](http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/faculty/mstohl/failed_states/1998/papers/sorensen.html). This entrenches divisions, rather than creating an inclusive democratic process.
1.2.1.1.3. Pro: Such snap elections also lead to [massive overspending](http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/faculty/mstohl/failed_states/1998/papers/sorensen.html) from state coffers, as governments seek to reward traditional supporters, typically members of particular ethnic groups and civil servants, who smoothen the transition process or gain votes for them.
1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: This makes such governments believe that clientelism will secure their power and victory in future elections. Instead of fostering democracy, forced democracy makes regimes [entrench](http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/faculty/mstohl/failed_states/1998/papers/sorensen.html) a system of clientelism and patronage networks.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Reforms that check boxes for improving democracy are often meaningless or corrupt. When Iraq imposed a quota for women in parliament, [many women on party lists](http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1870765,00.html) were just female relatives of male politicians, there to fill the quota. It boosted the statistic for female representation in government without making much of a real advancement.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Pseudo-reforms like these are usually quickly discovered. In the case of Iraq, the country's ranking in democracy indexes like the one by [The Economist \(p. 28\)](https://www.eiu.com/Handlers/WhitepaperHandler.ashx?fi=Democracy-Index-2016.pdf&mode=wp&campaignid=DemocracyIndex2016) has therefore not seen any improvement during the last decade and [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2017) names it as one of the countries where the democratic system requires special scrutiny.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Having a veneer of a solution can be even worse than leaving the problem exposed, because it discourages further work and improvement.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: A thin layer of democratic coating superimposed on a system of personal rule without any major structural changes will simply [entrench](http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/faculty/mstohl/failed_states/1998/papers/sorensen.html) the power of the existing elite.
1.2.1.4. Pro: The level of democratization and the quality of governments are hard to [measure](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/23/how-do-you-measure-democracy/?utm_term=.4d1ea23f4a0a) accurately and in a fair way.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: Democracy indices and their conceptual assumptions are flawed.
1.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: [Existing democracy indices](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/democracy-and-democratization/democracy-barometer?s=7494) assume that democracy is a homogenous phenomenon and do not give consideration to the fact that democracy can have variations and different developments.
1.2.1.4.1.1.1. Con: This is not an inherent problem of democracy indexes, but one that is easily solved by improving existing models. Proposals for indexes that take multiple definitions of democracy into account already exist \(e.g. [Coppedge et al, p. 253](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/conceptualizing-and-measuring-democracy-a-new-approach/DAF249E74DDD3ACE3FFC96F20EE4074D)\).
1.2.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Existing indices are [accused of](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/democracy-and-democratization/democracy-barometer?s=7494) cultural blindness.
1.2.1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: Indices use universal criteria to measure democracy. These are inappropriate as democracy can only be properly evaluated by "[locally-defined and context-sensitive criteria](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/democracy-and-democratization/democracy-barometer?s=7494)".
1.2.1.4.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: For instance, mandatory voting makes a country less democratic according to the EIU index. While it may infringe on individual freedom, this measure has proven to enhance turnout and representativeness of political institutions, which can be especially important in areas with large disenfranchised communities \([Coppedge and Gerring, p.247](http://polisci.emory.edu/faculty/jkstato/resources/Papers/concepts.pdf)\).
1.2.1.4.1.1.3. Pro: There is no universally valid model of democracy and human rights \([Samarasinghe, p. 29](https://de.scribd.com/document/88608861/Democracy-and-Democratization-in-Developing-Countries-Samarasinghe)\).
1.2.1.4.1.2. Con: The constructive criticism of existing democracy indices leads to improvement and the development of enhanced indices such as [the democracy barometer](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/democracy-and-democratization/democracy-barometer?s=7494), which takes quantitative and qualitative methods into account.
1.2.1.4.1.2.1. Con: An improved index does not mean it is a perfect or a sufficiently accurate index; it can still prevent legitimate democracies from receiving much needed aid.
1.2.1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Making democracy indexes central to how substantial amounts of development aid are allocated every year will increase public scrutiny and make it even more likely that existing indexes are improved upon quickly.
1.2.1.4.1.3. Pro: The indices' measurement methods are often inaccurate and superficial.
1.2.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Democracy indexes rely on data and assume that it is accurate and represents the phenomena measured. This is usually not the case.
1.2.1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: Especially for countries that qualify for development aid, relevant data is often not available, unreliable or both \([see e.g. Bowman et al, p. 940](http://blmdemocracy.gatech.edu/BLM%20final%20paper%20for%20web.pdf)\).
1.2.1.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: Indexes inherently assume that it is possible to measure and compare political phenomena using quantitative measures. For this to be true, the underlying data sets need to exist and be both reliable and complete.
1.2.1.4.1.3.2. Pro: Democracy indices incorrectly focus predominantly on the procedural aspects of democracies.
1.2.1.4.1.3.2.1. Pro: The mere comparison of procedural aspects, such as procedurally correct elections, results in inflated scores of democratic nations, leading to '[self-congratulatory tendencies](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/democracy-and-democratization/democracy-barometer?s=7494)'.
1.2.1.4.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: [Inflated scores](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/democracy-and-democratization/democracy-barometer?s=7494) create the impression that democracy is an already finished process, but in fact, it is an open-ended one. There is no such thing as a perfectly developed democracy.
1.2.1.4.1.3.2.2. Pro: By focusing on procedural aspects such as the regularity of election processes and frameworks, indexes tend to ignore the extent to which elected politicians actually rule on behalf of those who elected them \([substantive aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantive_democracy)\).
1.2.1.4.1.3.3. Pro: The methods indices use for data coding are potentially inaccurate.
1.2.1.4.1.3.3.1. Pro: As the [Freedom House-index's](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/democracy-and-democratization/democracy-barometer?s=7494) encoding rules are vague and the data pool is not clearly fixed, there is a potential for subjective bias.
1.2.1.4.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: The data pools of older democracies and Christian countries are [systematically](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/democracy-and-democratization/democracy-barometer?s=7494) better coded than Marxist-Leninist countries because more accurate information is readily available about the former.
1.2.1.4.1.3.3.2. Pro: Many indexes like Freedom House or Polity rely on expert coding, but don't test for inter-coder reliability, i.e. whether the same coding is reproduced when different, but equally qualified, experts are consulted. Coding thus risks being highly subjective \([Coppedge et al, p. 251](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/conceptualizing-and-measuring-democracy-a-new-approach/DAF249E74DDD3ACE3FFC96F20EE4074D)\).
1.2.1.4.1.3.4. Pro: The [Vanhanen Index](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/democracy-and-democratization/democracy-barometer?s=7494) directly compares political participation rates without assessing factors that may influence this participation in the first place.
1.2.1.4.1.3.4.1. Pro: [The Vanhanen Index](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/democracy-and-democratization/democracy-barometer?s=7494) compares absolute participation rates without assessing the relative opportunities and barriers to voting in each country which gives an incorrect result as to which countries are and are not democracies.
1.2.1.4.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Switzerland's election turnout is low compared to other democracies \([Blais, p. 520](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316688662_Why_is_Turnout_So_Low_in_Switzerland_Comparing_the_Attitudes_of_Swiss_and_German_Citizens_Towards_Electoral_Democracy)\) and would result in a lower Vanhanen Index rating because the political opportunities created by direct democratic elements are not taken sufficiently into consideration.
1.2.1.4.1.3.4.1.2. Pro: Analyses of four anti-nuclear movements in different countries came to the conclusion that general characteristics of domestic political opportunity structures explain the impact of protest and social movements to a significant degree \([Kitschelt, p. 84](http://www.marcuse.org/harold/hmimages/seabrook/861KitscheltAntiNuclear4Democracies.pdf)\).
1.2.1.4.1.3.4.2. Con: The Vanhanen Index - now usually referred to as the [Polyarchy dataset](https://www.prio.org/Data/Governance/Vanhanens-index-of-democracy/) - has not been updated for years beyond 2000 and is likely of little relevance anymore.
1.2.1.4.1.4. Pro: Democracy indices are never politically or ideologically neutral, but influenced by the environment they were created in and the purpose they are meant to serve.
1.2.1.4.1.4.1. Pro: The widely used Freedom House index has been criticised for being driven by a neoconservative and neoliberal agenda e.g. by heavily prioritising economic freedom as a criterion, while deprioritising equality and other kinds of freedom \([Giannone, p. 72](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13510340903453716)\).
1.2.1.4.1.4.2. Con: Beyond Central America, where indexes struggle with inaccurate data, there is a high correlation between major democracy indexes. This indicates that even if there is some bias, the overall results are reliable \([Bowman et al, p. 943](http://blmdemocracy.gatech.edu/BLM%20final%20paper%20for%20web.pdf)\)
1.2.1.4.1.4.2.1. Con: More detailed inspections of the underlying data show that this is largely due to "extreme" democracies such as Sweden or Canada. The correlation between indexes for countries that are not "perfect democracies" is significantly lower \([Coppedge et al, p. 252](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/conceptualizing-and-measuring-democracy-a-new-approach/DAF249E74DDD3ACE3FFC96F20EE4074D)\).
1.2.1.4.1.5. Con: All other ways of determining the distribution of development aid would also rely on indices, for example to evaluate the need for and potential of aid in a given country. There, too, conceptual problems would arise. In this sense, democracy indices are not necessarily more flawed than the alternatives.
1.2.1.4.1.5.1. Pro: Indices such as the UN's [Human Development Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/2016-report) are meant to capture a country's basic development status yet make some questionable assumptions, e.g. that equal weight should be given to to income, education and life expectancy \(when the three might be of very different relevance\).
1.2.1.4.1.5.2. Pro: The UN's [Gender Inequality Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/gender-inequality-index-gii) suffers from a limited range of variables that fail to capture many dimensions of inequality, for example by including the unpaid work women do at home.
1.2.1.4.1.5.3. Con: However, making development assistance conditional on democratization and relying on indices adds another layer to already existing problematic measurement processes, and therefore increases the probability of error.
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: In order to improve monitoring and measurement of democracy, bureaucratic costs will have to increase.
1.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: Even current mechanisms of monitoring aid are [insufficient](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/how-much-aid-really-lost-corruption) for tracking the extent of corruption in aid projects.
1.2.1.4.2.2. Pro: Aid recipient states must be observed frequently in order to make sure they are democratic; this process causes additional costs.
1.2.1.4.2.2.1. Con: Numerous NGOs, such as Freedom House and Amnesty International, as well as inter-governmental agencies, such as the UN and the OECD, track and evaluate political realities around the world anyway already.
1.2.1.4.2.2.2. Pro: The lack of [monitoring mechanisms](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/failure-of-foreign-aid-in-developing-countries-a-quest-for-alternatives-2151-6219-1000231.php?aid=80040&view=mobile) makes existing conditional development aid ineffective, resulting in only a minor impact on policies.
1.2.1.4.2.2.2.1. Con: However minor a move towards democratisation is still better than no move towards democratisation.
1.2.1.4.2.3. Pro: The high level of bureaucracy involved in development aid is already a reason why its provision lost public support in democracies \([Easterly, p. 64](https://www.cgdev.org/files/2786_file_cgd_wp004_rev.pdf)\).
1.2.1.4.2.4. Con: Existing democracy indices are able to make broad distinctions between political systems, such as between democracies and non-democratic states, without difficulty and only fail at fine and gradual classifications \([Coppedge, p.1](http://indicatorsinfo.pbworks.com/f/Coppedge.pdf)\). Therefore, indices are suited to evaluate whether or not a state is authorized for aid.
1.2.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.2.4.
1.2.1.4.4. Pro: The path to democracy is not necessary a steady climb, so penalising countries that falter may result in a further erosion of democracy.
1.2.1.4.4.1. Con: Even if democratisation advances through singular sudden events, tying aid to those events likely catalyses them.
1.2.1.4.5. Con: Where necessary, it has been possible to define and measure the state of democracy in countries, for example in the EU's [Copenhagen criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_criteria) that have to be fulfilled by states in order to be eligible for EU membership.
1.2.1.4.6. Pro: A key component of measuring democratisation is assessing levels of corruption, yet it is [near impossible](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/supreme-court-strikes-down-mcc-corruption-hard-hurdle-well-sort) to measure corruption. This policy simply makes the work of aid organisations significantly harder without any guaranteed benefits.
1.2.1.4.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.4.2.1.
1.2.1.4.6.2. Pro: One of the most well-known and frequently cited corruption indexes, the [Corruption Perceptions Index](https://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/overview), is based on perception and not hard evidence.
1.2.1.4.6.3. Con: While it may be impossible to measure corruption as a whole, it is possible to identify [proxy indicators](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/26/theres-more-to-measuring-corruption-than-transparency-internationals-annual-index-just-released/?utm_term=.d05d37fa8e6e) for corruption or measure components of it, such as in the [Bribe Payers Index](https://www.transparency.org/bpi2011).
1.2.1.4.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.4.1.8.1.
1.2.1.5. Con: Democracy usually goes hand in hand with transparency, and transparency usually helps to unveil democracies that exist only pro forma. It is therefore difficult to imagine democracy existing only as a veneer without this being discovered.
1.2.2. Pro: Democracies better preserve the rights and freedoms of their people.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Democratisation improves rights and conditions for women and minorities.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: While dictators can maintain power through the support of an inner circle, parties in democracies have to win support from a broad group of people in order to win elections. This indirectly benefits women and minorities.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Women comprise more than half the population in most countries; parties cannot win elections without them, and therefore have an incentive to support policies that benefit women.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Even a small minority can swing an election; parties have an incentive to promote minority rights in order to win their support.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: On the contrary, women are often [shut out](https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/kristine-goulding/tunisia-will-democracy-be-good-for-womens-rights) of participation in new democracies; their freedom [relies on](http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2011/110324T-MoghadamProtests.html) the role they play during the transition.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: The quality of women's rights in a democracy [largely depends](http://democracyinafrica.org/quality-democracy-matters-womens-rights-democratising-states/) on the quality of that democracy and the effort spent on enshrining women's rights.
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Democratization and gender equality are [correlated](https://www.brookings.edu/research/democracy-gender-equality-and-womens-physical-security/): In democracies, there are smaller political, educational and economic gender gaps than in flawed or non-democracies.
1.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: Women are more likely to be in power in democracies.
1.2.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Of the [countries](http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2016/06/politics/women-world-leaders/) that have had women as leaders, the vast majority are democracies.
1.2.2.1.4. Pro: In democracies, the [physical security](https://www.brookings.edu/research/democracy-gender-equality-and-womens-physical-security/) of women is significantly higher than in autocracies.
1.2.2.2. Con: Whilst the rights and freedoms of people may be protected formally in democracies, elections in under developed countries can often trigger [instability](https://books.google.ie/books/about/Wars_Guns_and_Votes.html?id=S8ckdsNhS3wC&redir_esc=y). Violence that occurs as a result of this means that these rights are often not protected in any meaningful sense.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.1.
1.2.3. Con: Introducing democratization as a condition for development aid prevents developing countries from turning into democracies, as economic growth is a precondition for successful democratization.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Poor countries usually do not democratize; a minimum of economic development and wealth seem necessary for democracy to take root. Thus, the promotion of democracy without prior economic progress might approach the issue in the wrong way \([Huntington, p. 60](https://books.google.de/books?id=IMjyTFG04JYC&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=%22as+countries+develop+economically+and+move+into+this+zone%22&source=bl&ots=0fXLUaRHnA&sig=6mmBgEVo7iBahn0o1GWtHIn2SDQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjupPKz3ZnVAhWpB8AKHfG5CNIQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&q=%22as%20countries%20develop%20economically%20and%20move%20into%20this%20zone%22&f=false)\).
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Education is [crucial](http://opinion.bdnews24.com/2014/10/01/is-poverty-a-barrier-to-democratisation/) to a successful democracy, as only then are people aware of what a democracy is, and what political rights they have. Poor countries with low education levels tend to have populations which aren't aware of, or interested in, democracy as a political system.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Historically, most [Pacific Island countries](http://www.democraticaudit.com/2014/11/26/democracy-can-and-does-take-root-in-poor-countries-but-only-if-we-look-at-small-states/) have not had national universities, which meant that islanders had to go abroad to acquire their diplomas, and often did not return afterwards, resulting in a migratory brain drain that also undermined economic capacity. Yet they were still democracies.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: In poor countries, with little wealth, democracy requires redistribution of wealth and resources. The elite have [more to lose](http://opinion.bdnews24.com/2014/10/01/is-poverty-a-barrier-to-democratisation/) in such countries as the total available wealth is limited, whereas redistribution in richer countries without destroying the power of the elite is possible.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: In poor countries, landowners are the elite. They have the most to lose in a move towards democracy, as democracy would require land redistribution \([Acemoglu & Robinson, p. 289](http://www.untag-smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_1/DEMOCRACY%20Economic%20Origins%20of%20Dictatorship%20and%20democracy.pdf)\). Economic growth, which involves [industrialisation](http://www.herald.co.zw/rapid-industrialisation-key-to-economic-growth/), is first crucial to lessen the power and influence of these landowners.
1.2.3.1.2.2. Pro: Industrialists have more to lose from potential political unrest than big land owners do. This means that the elite should comprise of industrialists, who are more amenable to granting democracy and political rights to prevent their businesses from suffering \([Acemoglu & Robinson, p. 293](http://www.untag-smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_1/DEMOCRACY%20Economic%20Origins%20of%20Dictatorship%20and%20democracy.pdf)\). In order for this to happen, economic growth must precede democratisation.
1.2.3.1.3. Pro: It is unlikely that those who are struggling to make ends meet will care about the political system of their country. Such poor people would accept any regime that promises to provide them with the bare necessities.
1.2.3.1.4. Con: Yet some poor countries are democratic, and some rich countries are not democratic.
1.2.3.1.4.1. Pro: Botswana, Ghana, and Namibia are all [poor nations that are democratic](http://www.democraticaudit.com/2014/11/26/democracy-can-and-does-take-root-in-poor-countries-but-only-if-we-look-at-small-states/).
1.2.3.1.4.2. Pro: The wealthy Persian Gulf states and the rich Southeast Asian countries of Singapore and Brunei are [not democratic](http://www.democraticaudit.com/2014/11/26/democracy-can-and-does-take-root-in-poor-countries-but-only-if-we-look-at-small-states/).
1.2.3.1.4.3. Pro: In total, the [number of democracies](http://www.democraticaudit.com/2014/11/26/democracy-can-and-does-take-root-in-poor-countries-but-only-if-we-look-at-small-states/) across the world with GDP per capita levels under US$10,000 is 23.
1.2.3.1.5. Con: Small states often have unique developmental challenges that prevent industrialisation and economic growth.This does not mean they cannot be democratic.
1.2.3.1.5.1. Pro: Economic development via industrialisation has proved [impossible](http://www.democraticaudit.com/2014/11/26/democracy-can-and-does-take-root-in-poor-countries-but-only-if-we-look-at-small-states/) in the Pacific small island states: small populations, limited natural resources, remoteness, geographic and cultural fragmentation, vulnerability to external economic shocks, susceptibility to extreme events like cyclones and earthquakes, dependence on imports, and fragile environments all prevent industrialisation.
1.2.3.1.5.1.1. Pro: Perversely, the two countries in the Pacific with the strongest growth prospects due to their relatively larger size and natural resource endowments – Fiji and Solomon Islands – have had [the most trouble sustaining democratic government](http://www.democraticaudit.com/2014/11/26/democracy-can-and-does-take-root-in-poor-countries-but-only-if-we-look-at-small-states/).
1.2.3.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.2.
1.2.3.2. Pro: A [vast academic](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.115) literature supports the idea that democratisation is more likely in developed countries.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Even though economic development can support authoritarian regimes in the short run by providing them with legitimacy, [research indicates that](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12135/full) it is associated with the emergence of democracy in the long run.
1.2.4. Con: There is no guarantee that non-democratic states would actually receive any aid by the time they democratise; it's unclear why any dictator would take the gamble of democratising for a reward that may never accrue.
1.2.4.1. Pro: For non-democratic rulers, the benefit of aid often lies in using it for their own ends. There is no reason why such a ruler would democratise in order to gain aid, given they won't be able to use aid for that purpose any more in a democratic system.
1.2.4.2. Con: By the time the affected countries reach a certain democracy-index ranking, they will receive assistance. As the DAC provides [official development assistance](http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DAC%20List%20of%20ODA%20Recipients%202014%20final.pdf) to all countries with a low gross national income, there is nothing unclear or uncertain about this.
1.2.4.3. Pro: At the very least, the amount of aid you receive in the future is uncertain. Dictatorial regimes have little incentive to risk the process of democratisation for aid that may actually be very little in the end.
1.2.5. Con: Externally induced democratization is unlikely to become a success.
1.2.5.1. Pro: USAID provided significant amounts of 'democracy aid' for Latin American countries with poor results and minor impact on the democratic transition \([Samarasinghe, p. 35](https://de.scribd.com/document/88608861/Democracy-and-Democratization-in-Developing-Countries-Samarasinghe)\).
1.2.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.2.5.3. Con: Conditional aid is an incentive to internally democratize without much external influence except the provision of funds and resources.
1.2.5.3.1. Con: The [political elites](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/liberate-africa-its-political-elites) have historically benefited from exploiting their countries, and are unlikely to give up the power they have.
1.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: Corrupt [political elites](http://www.dw.com/en/corrupt-political-elites-block-development-in-africa/a-4643406) in Africa hinder development and cement the status quo.
1.2.5.3.1.2. Pro: Autocrats often face death, exile or imprisonment when their regimes are ousted \([Geddes, Wright and Frantz, p. 21](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6e61/4ede2afa30781e8b885fe9e92a3dbcaa655e.pdf)\). They therefore have a strong incentive to stay in power for as long as possible.
1.2.5.4. Pro: A minimum requirement for democracy is a 'restraint in the use of violence in domestic political affairs'. Democratization will not function in [high-violence](http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=524) societies; many [developing countries](https://www.indy100.com/article/these-are-the-10-most-violent-countries-in-the-world--bJeHFgPXKbx) are considered as such.
1.2.5.5. Pro: As many developing countries are highly sensitive to what they consider as 'donor country interference', requiring countries to change their political system in order to receive aid will likely be regarded as a violation of sovereignty \([Samarasinghe, p. 30](https://de.scribd.com/document/88608861/Democracy-and-Democratization-in-Developing-Countries-Samarasinghe)\).
1.2.5.5.1. Con: Recipient states can choose to reject the conditional aid if they believe it will violate their sovereignty. If they accept the conditional aid, they have consented to the 'donor country interference'.
1.2.5.5.1.1. Con: It is hardly a fair choice if recipient states are dependent on foreign aid in order to provide for their peoples' basic needs.
1.2.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.3.
1.2.5.7. Pro: A democracy that has been achieved and established internally is more likely to be respected and appreciated by the population than a democracy that has been provided by foreigners.
1.2.5.8. Pro: Democracy aid has been largely unsuccessful where it has been tried.
1.2.5.8.1. Con: In the case of Burma, democracy aid, along with sanctions, has been credited with provoking popular unrest. These efforts are seen as contributing factors to the country's democratization over the past decade \([CFTNI, p. 24-30](https://187ock2y3ejr34z8752m6ize-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Macdonald-Geoffrey-Official-1.pdf)\).
1.2.5.8.2. Con: Despite strong resistance from host states, democracy aid has [strengthened](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ben-barber/trouble-is-democracy-aid-_b_1906647.html) free press and protest and helped to topple corrupt governments.
1.2.5.8.3. Pro: [Research](http://recom.wider.unu.edu/article/economic-aid-vs-democracy-aid-democratic-consolidation-africa) has found that while economic aid is associated with democratic transition, democracy aid is not.
1.2.5.8.4. Pro: Many countries [do not allow foreign funding](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/09/democracy-promotion-is-failing-heres-why/?utm_term=.64dbf226e48b) to NGOs that promote democracy and political participation within their borders. These governments would be unlikely to accept conditional aid.
1.2.6. Con: Non-democratic rulers will only democratise if they believe they will survive political liberalisation. If they believe that they cannot win in competitive, multi-party elections, they will risk foregoing foreign aid as democratisation would mean the end of their rule.
1.2.6.1. Con: Even if this is the case, conditional foreign aid could provide sufficient additional incentive to some non-democratic rulers to democratise where previously they were not willing to.
1.2.6.2. Pro: Even if these non-democratic rulers win the first few elections that take place, there is no guarantee that they will win in the long term. The political trajectory of [India](http://thediplomat.com/2017/04/how-the-indian-national-congress-lost-india/) and [South Africa](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/south-africa-anc-local-elections-160805132106004.html) illustrate how dominant parties lose out when political competition emerges.
1.2.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.1.2.
1.2.7. Pro: Implementing democracy is the best way to sustainably help developing countries.
1.2.7.1. Pro: A study of a panel of countries between 1960 and 2010 found that a country that transitions from a non-democracy to a democracy achieves about 20 percent higher GDP per capita in the next 25 years \([Acemoglu, et al., p. 1](https://economics.mit.edu/files/10759)\).
1.2.7.1.1. Con: This research has been called into question, for example by [a study](https://publications.iadb.org/bitstream/handle/11319/7758/Democracy-Does-Not-Cause-Growth-The-Importance-of-Endogeneity-Arguments.pdf?sequence=1) involving 165 country-specific democracy experts. It rejects the link between democracy and economic growth, establishing it only in the minority of cases where democracy was the result of preceding economic turmoil.
1.2.7.1.2. Con: This assumes that the transition to democracy is successful. Yet democratic transitions oftentimes result in conflict, violence and instability, get stuck or regress once again. The outcome may be worse than what was in place before.
1.2.7.1.2.1. Pro: [Examples from Southeast Asia](http://www.gcsp.ch/News-Knowledge/Publications/Democratic-Transitions-and-Internal-Political-Conflict-in-Southeast-Asia) caution that transitions can result in violence and conflict and even regress once again.
1.2.7.1.2.2. Pro: The move to democracy oftentimes involves intermediate political regime types. Research points out that these intermediate regimes have "exceptionally high risks of instability" \([Goldstone et al., p. 205](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00426.x/pdf)\).
1.2.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.
1.2.7.3. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.2.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.
1.2.7.5. Pro: The World Bank has argued that 'underlying the litany of Africa's development problems is a crisis of governance'. Stable democracies better allow for sustainable and stable growth \([World Bank, p. 60](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/498241468742846138/pdf/multi0page.pdf)\).
1.2.7.5.1. Con: Yet the World Bank, along with other aid organisations, [continues](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2010/11/25/foreign-aid-scoundrels/) to provide foreign aid to non-democratic regimes. Even if the World Bank believes this to be true, it does not put it into practice.
1.2.7.5.2. Con: The World Bank has [not](http://www.nyudri.org/aidwatcharchive/2010/10/can-we-get-the-world-bank-to-say-the-d-word/) explicitly stated that democracy is a fundamental part of their development strategy. In fact, the former head of the World Bank, Justin Lin, does [not](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/11/boom-doctor) believe that democracy is the prime governance structure that leads to development.
1.2.7.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.2.
1.2.7.6. Pro: Democracy has inbuilt feedback systems \(e.g. elections and public criticism of policies\) which allow the population to tell the government how best to serve their needs. Under a dictatorship, there is no way to realise the true needs of the people.
1.2.7.6.1. Con: Politicians are not always open and honest about the effects of their policies. This skews the feedback systems available in democracies.
1.2.7.6.1.1. Pro: The Brexit campaign in the UK was [full of lies and made-up facts](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/eu-referendum-claims-won-brexit-fact-checked/). The promise of additional £350 million a week for the NHS, the reason why many voted for Brexit, was completely false.
1.2.7.6.1.2. Pro: Politicians around the world [regularly lie](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/10/25/why-politicians-lie/?utm_term=.b82bdcd9dce9) in order to exploit political ignorance of the larger population.
1.2.7.6.1.3. Pro: People often [vote against their own interests](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2016/11/08/heres-why-you-may-vote-against-yourself/#4cea0f9925fa).
1.2.7.6.1.3.1. Pro: Voters tend to prefer policies that benefit them in the short term, [even if they are harmful](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/why-people-vote-for-bad-policies/511484/) in the long term.
1.2.7.6.1.3.2. Pro: American voters tend to vote against their preferences due to [partisanship](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/upshot/why-americans-vote-against-their-interest-partisanship.html).
1.2.7.6.1.4. Pro: Voters are often extremely misinformed about government policy.
1.2.7.6.1.4.1. Pro: [Australians](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/29/australians-massively-overestimate-level-of-foreign-aid-in-budget-poll-finds) and [Americans](https://borgenproject.org/us-foreign-aid-spending/) drastically overestimate the amount their governments spend on foreign aid.
1.2.7.6.1.4.2. Pro: People in the [UK](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/663429/Britons-Syrian-refugees-UK) underestimate the number of Syrian refugees and overestimate the number their country has taken in.
1.2.7.6.1.4.3. Pro: Americans and Britons [hugely overestimate](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americans-overestimate-muslim-population_us_5852e354e4b012849c05f509) the size of their countries' Muslim populations.
1.2.7.6.2. Con: Democracies are not truly ruled by the people as a whole, but by a small section of society.
1.2.7.6.2.1. Pro: [Corporate influence](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/12/lobbying-10-ways-corprations-influence-government) on politics gives a small share of wealthy and influential people disproportionate power.
1.2.7.6.2.2. Pro: Election results are driven by an increasingly small number of [swing voters](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/us/politics/pursuing-the-elusive-swing-voter.html).
1.2.7.6.2.3. Pro: The [socially](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/why-are-the-poor-and-minorities-less-likely-to-vote/282896/) and [economically](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/24/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-said-poor-people-dont-vote/) privileged are more likely to vote, and thus more likely to control public policy.
1.2.7.6.3. Con: This assumes that the general population of a country knows which policies will benefit it. This is not always the case.
1.2.7.6.4. Con: -> See 1.1.10.
1.2.8. Pro: As many developing countries depend on foreign aid to carry out basic governmental duties, non-democratic rulers will have to meet the democratisation conditions attached to aid, otherwise they risk foregoing it altogether.
1.2.8.1. Con: Not all recipient states are democracies or are likely to become democracies. If this happens, it significantly harms the poorest in aid recipient states, as they have no other way of meeting basic needs \([actionaid, p.17](http://www.actionaid.org/sites/files/actionaid/real_aid_3.pdf)\).
1.2.8.1.1. Pro: In [Ethiopia](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-22270164), one of the world's poorest countries with a low democracy index ranking, aid is used to fund and provide healthcare, drinking water and primary school education.
1.2.8.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.4.1.
1.2.8.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.2.8.1.4. Pro: Many of Africa's [authoritarian regimes](https://www.nap.edu/read/2041/chapter/4#13) are based on the tradition of a single unchallenged chief and the rule of a single party expressing the majority's will. To think the political systems and values in those countries will change anytime soon is highly unlikely.
1.2.8.1.4.1. Pro: As most African states' borders are the product of colonialism and its aftermath, a [strong political leader](https://www.nap.edu/read/2041/chapter/4#13) seems necessary in order to ensure unity in the face of ethnic, cultural and linguistic dissimilarities.
1.2.8.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.1.
1.2.8.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
1.2.8.2. Pro: The threat of withdrawing aid from Kenya in 1992 forced then President Arap Moi to amend the constitution to allow for a multi-party election in what was previously a one-party state \([Boulding & Hyde, p. 18/19](http://citation.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/7/8/8/pages87880/p87880-19.php)\).
1.2.8.3. Pro: If recipient states are heavily dependent on foreign aid and do not have access to other sources of revenue, especially after civil wars or large scale conflicts, they are likely to follow through on democratisation conditions imposed upon the aid they receive \([Girod](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230466693_Effective_Foreign_Aid_Following_Civil_War_The_Nonstrategic-Desperation_Hypothesis)\).
1.2.9. Pro: Unconditional development aid strengthens non-democratic regimes, reducing the incentives for democratisation.
1.2.9.1. Con: Unconditional aid can still strengthen incentives for democratization.
1.2.9.1.1. Pro: Autocrats have incentives to use at least some aid toward public goods, to maintain popular favor and decrease the likelihood of rebellion. Once those goods are provided, people are often empowered to push for democratic reforms.
1.2.9.1.1.1. Pro: Public goods like roads and hospitals help people live or work in cities, driving urbanization. The resulting concentration of people in cities [makes people better equipped](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2009-03-01/how-development-leads-democracy) to discuss politics, form opinions, and challenge the government.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1. Pro: In a study of 19 African countries, rural residents were more likely to support the incumbent government regardless of who it was, while urban residents were more likely to dissent \([Harding, 3-9](http://robinharding.org/RuralBias_Draft_June2012.pdf)\).
1.2.9.1.1.1.2. Pro: Collectivizing people in cities creates the critical masses necessary for political protest, which often holds the government accountable to making democratic reforms \([Weiner, 44](http://www.jstor.org/stable/41231016)\).
1.2.9.1.1.2. Pro: Increasing education and literacy in a population enables people to read the news and become more informed about politics, which again makes dissent more likely and increases pressures for accountability.
1.2.9.1.1.3. Pro: People who have their basic needs met are able to devote time toward political participation.
1.2.9.1.1.4. Con: Yet the push for these reforms by the people will be met with resistance from the regime, leading to suppression and further violation of human rights.
1.2.9.1.1.5. Con: This assumes sufficient aid actually makes its way to the people, to allow them to reach a position where they can participate in politics actively. Non-democratic regimes can simply provide minimal amounts of aid to their people that allow for bare sustenance.
1.2.9.1.1.6. Con: In the absence of democratic institutions development assistance will be spent by the regimes as they see fit. Their decisions will not always be fair, legal, or in the public interest.
1.2.9.1.1.6.1. Pro: Democratic institutions keep the political elites in check.
1.2.9.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: A free press is crucial to observe, control and blame the political elites.
1.2.9.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Basic political rights enable the population to address grievances or to protest against the misuse of monies.
1.2.9.1.1.6.1.3. Pro: A parliamentary opposition acts as a check on the ruling party by constantly questioning its actions and motives, and by positioning itself as an alternative in future elections.
1.2.9.1.1.6.1.4. Pro: A strong and independent judiciary is able to prosecute delinquent politicians.
1.2.9.1.1.6.1.4.1. Pro: Former South Korean president [Park Geun-hye](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/former-south-korean-president-park-geun-hye-on-trial-for-corruption) is currently on trial for corruption.
1.2.9.1.1.6.1.4.2. Pro: Several [Brazilian](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35810578) politicians are facing charges over a recent corruption scandal.
1.2.9.1.1.6.1.5. Con: Democratic institutions and controls can be circumvented by political elites.
1.2.9.1.1.6.1.5.1. Con: Democratic institutions and controls don't have to be perfect; they just have to be better than no checks and balances on a regime.
1.2.9.1.1.6.1.5.2. Pro: There are several historical as well as contemporary examples of elected presidents becoming de facto dictators, e.g. Russia's [Vladimir Putin](https://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/putin-really-is-a-dictator/).
1.2.9.1.1.6.1.5.3. Pro: Declaring a [state of emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency#Abuse) enables governments to expand their rights and to limit those of other actors.
1.2.9.1.1.6.1.5.3.1. Pro: After the 2016 coup attempt, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan took advantage of the state of emergency to [arrest](http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-turkey-european-union-20161109-story.html) numerous political opponents and hold a [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2017) to abolish the parliamentary system, giving the president significantly more power.
1.2.9.1.1.6.1.5.4. Pro: Perceived threats, [like terrorism](https://msu.edu/~chritzti/135/groupessay.html), are used to limit civil rights and to expand governmental powers.
1.2.9.1.1.6.1.5.4.1. Pro: Following the 9/11 attacks, the US government used terrorism as justification for signing into law the controversial and arguably unconstitutional [USA Patriot Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act), which allowed for indefinite detentions of immigrants, property searches without the owner's knowledge or consent, and increased federal surveillance without a court order.
1.2.9.1.1.6.2. Con: Government funded development assistance can be implemented by [NGOs](http://www.cn.undp.org/content/dam/china/docs/Publications/UNDP-CH11%20An%20Overview%20of%20International%20NGOs%20in%20Development%20Cooperation.pdf), bypassing the trust, fairness, and efficiency concerns of trusting undemocratic governments.
1.2.9.1.1.6.3. Pro: If foreign aid is fungible, it allows non-democratic rulers to use aid monies to pay off political challengers, fund repression, or simply pocket aid for current or future personal consumption. Democratic states would not use aid for these purposes.
1.2.9.1.1.6.3.1. Pro: Being able to use foreign aid for personal consumption increases the utility of staying in power. Non-democratic rulers have less reason to leave power and allow democratisation to take place.
1.2.9.1.1.6.3.2. Con: Donor states are perfectly entitled to require that their aid be spent on development projects; this does not require that the aid be restricted to democratic states.
1.2.9.1.1.6.3.2.1. Con: There is no guarantee that non-democratic states will not misuse the aid, even if the aid is tied to specific projects.
1.2.9.1.1.6.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.4.1.9.1.
1.2.9.1.1.6.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.10.
1.2.9.1.1.6.4. Con: In countries where the state apparatus is weak, has a limited range and suffers from issues such as corruption, non-democratic governments can be more effective at serving the public interest than democratic governance.
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.5.1.
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2. Pro: While non-democratic governments are usually not able to provide political and social rights, they can provide economic growth. For people in poverty, a place to live, a job to work and sufficient meals are arguably more valuable than the right to vote in elections.
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.2. Pro: Some of the most successful stories of national development with the help of development aid and in the public interest were achieved by non-democratic countries.
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.2.1. Pro: In Taiwan, the 1950s and 1960s saw a large influx of foreign aid, high economic growth rates and the foundation for the rapid development of the country under authoritarian rule and decades of martial law \([Roy, p. 95f.](https://books.google.de/books?id=DNqasVI-gWMC&pg=PA99&dq=taiwan+development+foreign+aid&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_hIWb0pnVAhXqDMAKHYgxA9MQ6AEIQzAF#v=onepage&q=taiwan%20development%20foreign%20aid&f=false)\).
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.3.
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.2.4. Con: Pure economic advancement may not be the best indicator of the improvement of the quality of life in a country. Growth must be accompanied by equitable income distribution.
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.2.4.1. Pro: China's immense economic development over the last decades came with huge periodic unemployment and depleting social safety nets. [As a result, the people of China are no happier than they were 25 years ago](http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2017/)
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.2.4.2. Con: Economic growth is the best way to reduce poverty \([Department for International Development, p. 3](http://www.oecd.org/derec/unitedkingdom/40700982.pdf)\).
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.2.4.2.1. Pro: [Poverty](https://www.infoplease.com/homework-help/social-studies/wealth-and-poverty-ultimate-issue-quality-life) has a very strong negative effect on individuals' quality of life, for the poor in particular, but even for those who do not directly suffer from poverty: it creates crime.
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.2.4.3. Pro: Countries such as Japan saw economic growth accompanied by a decrease in income inequality during the 1960's and 70's. This was because of provision of benefits such as childcare, company housing, guaranteed life-long employment, health care, and subsidized meals in addition to wages, rather than reliance on absolute economic growth \([Feng, p. 3/4](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/07_china_economy_wang.pdf)\).
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.2.4.3.1. Pro: Similar levels of growth and reduction in economic inequality were seen in Taiwan and South Korea, both under authoritarian rule at the time. This was because the East Asian region shared a cultural tradition of collectivism honoring shared material benefits \([Feng, p. 3](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/07_china_economy_wang.pdf)\). This indicates that income redistributive policies are independent of the type of government in place.
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.2.4.3.1.1. Con: This model of 'growth with equity' ended for these states in the mid-1980's, where levels of income inequality in these societies mostly surpassed what they had been a half-century earlier \([Feng, p. 4](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/07_china_economy_wang.pdf)\).
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.2.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.6.2.4.1.
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.5.3.1.
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.3. Con: Countries where the state apparatus suffers from the issues mentioned above are in the most need of democratic institutions to provide checks and balances against abuses of power.
1.2.9.1.1.6.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.4.10.
1.2.9.1.1.6.5. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.2.
1.2.9.1.1.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.4.1.8.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7. Pro: There is a significantly higher amount of corruption in non-democratic states.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.1. Con: Democracies, and especially young ones, equally have to deal with corruption and bribery.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.1.1. Pro: A strong and confident civil society and the societal conviction to fight corruption have a higher impact on political institutions than the process of democratization itself \([Hung-En Sung, p. 187](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hung-En_Sung/publication/226036499_Democracy_and_Political_Corruption_A_Cross-National_Comparison/links/09e4150bc9b10ce238000000/Democracy-and-Political-Corruption-A-Cross-National-Comparison.pdf)\). Therefore, mere democratization is not enough to wipe out corruption.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.1.2. Pro: In Brazil, the past three presidents are currently facing [corruption charges](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35810578) - two for accepting substantial bribes from private firms, and one for illegally moving funds between government budgets.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.1.3. Pro: Although India is a democracy, a study came to the conclusion that the country is the [most corrupt](https://www.forbes.com/sites/suparnagoswami/2017/03/08/study-finds-india-is-asias-most-corrupt-country-while-japan-comes-in-last/#a788b2f1201f) in Asia.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.1.4. Pro: Indonesia, a democracy, belongs to the world's most [corrupt countries](https://qz.com/25891/will-indonesia-become-the-next-republic-of-congo-or-like-japan/).
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.1.4.1. Con: However, since democratization is in progress, Indonesian citizens use their democratic liberties and start to emerge by founding [grass roots anti-corruption movements](https://qz.com/25891/will-indonesia-become-the-next-republic-of-congo-or-like-japan/).
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.1.5. Pro: [Mexico](https://theconversation.com/mexicos-corruption-problems-are-still-among-the-worlds-deepest-76627), a democracy, suffers from severe and widely ramified corruption.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.1.6. Con: The mentioned examples are not full but [flawed democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index), in which democratic institutions could not completely unfold their effects yet.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.1.6.1. Con: Even highly democratic and developed countries like [the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/17/mps-expenses-martin-williams-parliament-ltd) have suffered corruption scandals in recent years.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.1.7. Con: While some democracies have to contend with corruption as well, it is relatively less corruption than exists in non-democratic regimes. In 2009, almost all of the top 30 most corrupt countries were [dictatorships](https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/22/corruption-government-dictatorship-biz-corruption09-cx_mp_0122pei.html).
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.6.7.1.6.1.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.2. Con: In democracies, corruption has evolved into different forms which are not considered as illegal, but the purpose remains: to use the political system in order to enforce private interests.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.2.1. Con: The point is not that there is no corruption in democracies, but that there is significantly less corruption in democracies than there is non-democratic regimes.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.2.2. Pro: Private firms use lobbying as a substitute for corruption, as it enables direct means of influence with policy makers as well as the exchange of favors between the private and the public sector \([Campos & Giovannoni, p. 21](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5a4a/385a8447f47370306d8a72742b0a1fcf0ac2.pdf)\).
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.2.2.1. Con: Lobbying is regulated through the law, and companies or governments who break these laws can be held accountable. The same cannot be said for corruption.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.2.3. Pro: It is established practice in many democracies that private cooperations or rich individuals strategically donate to nominees or political parties. This is [regarded](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/legalized-corruption-and-the-twilight-of-campaign-finance-law/360051/) as a legal form of corruption.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.2.3.1. Pro: The donation-system based on [reciprocal exchange](http://theconversation.com/no-bribes-please-were-corrupt-australians-59657) can be regarded as an abuse of the political system, as it enables private interests to achieve an advantage compared to public interests.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.2.3.2. Con: In functioning democracies, political donations are regulated and visible; this process is far more accountable than illegal corruption.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.4.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.4. Pro: Personalistic authoritarian regimes tend to establish structures that foster corruption, e.g. the distribution of patronage and goods among the leaders' entourage \([Golden / Chang, p.20](https://msu.edu/~echang/Research/chang_golden_authoritarian_SSQ.pdf)\).
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.5. Pro: Authoritarian leaders in developing countries often help themselves to public funds in order to live a lavish lifestyle.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.5.1. Pro: Equatorial Guinea's vice-president [Teodorin Obiang Nguema](https://qz.com/860194/equatorial-guineas-teodorin-obiang-has-had-his-luxury-yacht-seized-in-the-netherlands/) has misappropriated public funds in order to buy private jets, luxury cars and at least one yacht. Furthermore, he built up a fortune of $600 million.
1.2.9.1.1.6.7.5.2. Pro: [Denis Sassou Nguesso](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Denis-Sassou-Nguesso), the president of the Republic of the Congo was accused of misuse of public funds, defalcation, and money laundering in connection with a luxury property in France.
1.2.9.1.1.6.8. Con: Making aid conditional on democratic governance does by no means ensure that the money is not squandered into corrupt channels.
1.2.9.1.1.6.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.6.7.1.
1.2.9.1.1.6.8.2. Con: Levels of corruption partly [dictate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index) whether the recipient state is actually a democracy. If levels of corruption are so high as to make the aid provided useless, it is unlikely that that state will be a democracy to begin with.
1.2.9.1.1.6.8.3. Pro: Democracy and the absence of corruption do not always go together. In Transparency International's annual [Corruption Perceptions Index](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016), numerous democracies rank in the bottom-third, for example Mexico, Paraguay and Moldova.
1.2.9.1.1.6.8.4. Pro: Numerous countries that are not democratic rank well in Transparency International's [Corruption Perceptions Index](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016), for example Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.
1.2.9.1.1.6.9. Pro: Countries in economic crisis should concentrate on a few critical activities. Yet aid creates an incentive for non-democratic states to expand operations to include all initiatives donors want to fund, as they provide resources for patronage, as well as side benefits such as 'vehicles, study tours, salary increments, etc.' \([Brautigam, p. 263](https://deborahbrautigam.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/2004-foreign-aid-institutions-and-governance-in-subsaharan-africa.pdf)\).
1.2.9.1.1.6.10. Pro: Foreign aid projects implemented in non-democratic states use up resources needed elsewhere and undermine many of the institutions of those very states. The leaders themselves accept the aid in spite of this because it provides more resources for patronage. Democracies don't have such an incentive to accept aid that isn't useful. \([Brautigum, p. 263](https://deborahbrautigam.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/2004-foreign-aid-institutions-and-governance-in-subsaharan-africa.pdf)\).
1.2.9.1.1.6.10.1. Pro: The World Bank has argued that 'donors may fragment central capacity for policy formulation entering with ministries into bilateral deals on multiple projects without determining whether their cumulative effects are collectively sustainable'. \([World Bank, p. 84](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5980)\).
1.2.9.1.1.6.10.1.1. Pro: Each project requires government oversight and reporting. In Ghana, senior officials spent up to 44 weeks a year working on these projects. This prevents them from focusing on their own ministries and carrying out much needed reform \([Bautigum, p. 261](https://deborahbrautigam.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/2004-foreign-aid-institutions-and-governance-in-subsaharan-africa.pdf)\).
1.2.9.1.1.6.10.2. Pro: The public sector in developing countries [does not offer](http://www.gsdrc.org/docs/open/hd723.pdf) \(p. 1\) high pay and professional development. As a result, donor programs, by offering higher pay and further training, are able to poach of skilled workers. This hinders the ability of the government to implement reforms.
1.2.9.1.1.6.10.2.1. Pro: For an agriculture project in Kenya, the World Bank hired eight local people at salaries of $3,000-6,000 a month, compared to the civil service salary of $250 a month. In Mozambique, international organisations were paying five times the civil service wage for professional staff and 10 times the civil service wage for technicians \([World Bank, p. 88-89](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/612481468764422935/pdf/multi-page.pdf)\).
1.2.9.1.1.7. Con: Autocrats will have an incentive to provide public goods even if they are not receiving aid, the difference is that without aid these goods have to be funded through taxation. The push for democratic reforms is much more likely if public goods are funded through taxation, as citizens will want to control how their money is spent.
1.2.9.1.1.7.1. Pro: The [bellicist model of state formation](http://www.jesusradicals.com/uploads/2/6/3/8/26388433/warmaking.pdf) posits that this mutually re-enforcing relationship between taxation and the provision of public goods, such as defense, was an extremely important step for building strong institutions in what would become European democracies.
1.2.9.1.1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.2.9.2. Con: A dictator could easily use the withdrawal of aid to facilitate an under-siege mentality which would likely strengthen his position.
1.2.9.2.1. Pro: Attempts to impose a change of political system through withdrawal of aid can very easily be portrayed as foreign interference and used to make the idea of democracy synonymous with foreign domination for a country's people.
1.2.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.6.3.
1.2.9.4. Pro: Even if the aid reaches those who need it, unconditional aid allows autocrats to take credit for the benefits of aid and placate their people.
1.2.9.5. Pro: If autocrats control the aid, they can use it as leverage to control their population.
1.2.9.5.1. Pro: People will not protest or resist the regime if those actions could restrict their communities' access to aid projects.
1.2.9.6. Pro: Unconditional aid allows non-democratic rulers to entrench their patronage networks as they have more money to pay those who support them. This allows for consolidation of the regime. If aid is made conditional, there is no reason for these groups to stay loyal to the non-democratic ruler, weakening their position and opening up the possibility of democratisation.
1.2.10. Con: Reforms aimed at democratising can take many years to implement and yield results. Not providing aid during that time decreases the chances of the reforms ever being implemented in the first place.
1.2.10.1. Pro: By democratising, non-democratic rulers undermine their own power. There is little incentive for them to do so when the benefit of democratisation - foreign aid - will arrive many years later, when they may not even be in power anymore.
1.2.10.2. Pro: Democracy's triumph makes it the incumbent. Poor provision of public services and widespread corruption is [blamed](https://www.dawn.com/news/1196709) on democracy as an institution, paving the way for anti-democratic forces, such as the army. Preventing such forces from taking over, and recognising that democracy is a long term project, takes time. Donor states should assist this process rather than simply ending aid.
1.2.10.3. Con: The punishment for maintaining autocratic rule must be harsh in order to incentivise rulers to democratise. If aid is not stopped, the process may slow down as rulers become complacent, or the process may never start at all.
1.2.10.3.1. Con: In the current international climate, there will always be another donor, such as [China](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/chinas-aid-to-africa-monster-or-messiah/), that is happy to provide aid without political conditions to non-democratic regimes. This undermines the punishing effect of conditional aid.
1.2.10.3.1.1. Con: Even if China can provide aid to developing countries, there is always an incentive to find more aid revenue and grow the economy.
1.2.10.3.1.1.1. Con: Non-democratic rulers' main incentive is to stay in power, not to grow the economy. As long as economic growth is sufficient to keep them in power, they have no reason to seek out Western aid.
1.2.10.3.1.2. Con: China giving aid to a dictator and a democracy giving aid to a dictator lead to the same result. This is therefore no reason not to restrict that aid.
1.2.10.3.1.2.1. Pro: In either case, a dictator is funded and given the opportunity to consolidate power. Whether that comes from China or the West does not change the result.
1.2.10.3.1.2.2. Pro: There is no evidence to suggest that pro-Western dictators like Pinochet or Mohammad Reza Shah were any less evil than pro-Chinese or pro-Russian dictators.
1.2.10.3.1.2.3. Con: The Cambodian government feels much more comfortable restricting freedom of the press now that its [major source of development aid is China](https://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/25-years-of-foreign-press-freedom-under-threat-134013/). Before, when it received most of its aid from democratic countries, the government at least felt some pressure to allow civil society to flourish, even if it was not a democracy.
1.2.10.3.1.2.4. Con: Chinese aid is [state-to-state](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2016/07/19/chinese-foreign-assistance-explained/), where the aid is given directly to recipient governments, facilitating corruption and authoritarianism. Chinese aid is definitely worse than aid provided by democratic states.
1.2.10.3.1.2.5. Pro: If a dictator will be a dictator in either case, the moral thing to do is not to support them.
1.2.10.3.1.3. Pro: Beyond China, there are a number of other nondemocratic countries that are increasingly turning to alternatives to Western aid, for instance the [United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_development_aid_country_donors).
1.2.10.3.1.4. Con: China, or other potential autocratic donor states, do not have an infinite supply of money, and will therefore not be able to, or simply not want to, provide aid to every nation that wants it.
1.2.10.3.1.4.1. Pro: According to the World Bank, direct Chinese investment in Latin America between 2003 and 2009 amounted to US$4 billion a year; this was a '[modest](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/a-strong-dependence-the-potential-downside-to-chinas-investments-in-latin-america/)' amount compared to the investment made into the region by the U.S. and the Netherlands in 2010, which amounted, respectively, to US$19 billion and US$14.7 billion.
1.2.10.3.1.4.2. Pro: Chinese aid, in 2013, was [6.6%](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2016/07/19/chinese-foreign-assistance-explained/) of all aid given by democratic states. It is non-sensical to assume that China will want to increase, or even will be able to increase, its aid budget in order to match that of the democratic world.
1.2.10.3.1.5. Pro: Foreign investment is a key part of Chinese foreign policy under president Xi Jinping. The government plans to spend an [estimated 1 trillion US dollars](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/china-is-spending-nearly-1-trillion-to-rebuild-the-silk-road/) on subsidizing such investments throughout Asia, Africa and Europe. Additional funds are used to finance projects in [Latin America](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fp_201701_china_investment_lat_am.pdf).
1.2.10.3.1.6. Pro: When giving development aid, China always works with those in government and avoids funding [education or civil society](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/how-does-chinese-foreign-assistance-compare-to-that-of-developed-countries/) related projects. This practice entrenches existing power structures and strengthens authoritarian governments at the expense of civil society.
1.2.10.3.1.7. Con: Not every country should, or will want to, take aid from China.
1.2.10.3.1.7.1. Pro: Chinese assistance has been equated to [colonialism](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/magazine/is-china-the-worlds-new-colonial-power.html?mcubz=3&_r=1): projects are made possible by Chinese loans, yet they saddle the country's economy with debt, providing China with leverage over the recipient state.
1.2.10.3.1.7.1.1. Con: Equating Chinese investment in Africa with Western colonialism fundamentally misrepresents the [horrors of colonialism](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-investment-africa-power-dynamic-by-hannah-ryder-1-2017-07) in Africa: It did not only consist of economic leverage, but also straight-up political control, oppression of and violence towards Africans and control of local knowledge production and elites.
1.2.10.3.1.7.2. Pro: China often establishes [asymmetrical relationships](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/a-strong-dependence-the-potential-downside-to-chinas-investments-in-latin-america/) with states it deals with: China tends to provide assistance to buy up raw materials, only to flood local markets with cheaply produced goods.
1.2.10.3.1.7.2.1. Pro: In order to grow, China invested in or bought up mines around the world: copper in Peru, nickel in Papua New Guinea, iron ore in Australia. Yet when the Chinese economy slowed down and reduced its imports, many of these mines went bust, leading to unemployment and economic loss. Chinese assistance is [not unconditional or benevolent](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/magazine/is-china-the-worlds-new-colonial-power.html?mcubz=3&_r=1).
1.2.10.3.1.7.2.2. Con: Western aid equally creates [dependencies](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2017/04/20/making-africa-great-again-reducing-aid-dependency/) and asymmetric relationships between African and Western states.
1.2.10.3.1.7.2.3. Con: Economic relations with Western countries have equally condemned many developing countries to remain in a position of [dependency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_theory), where their economies work for Western ones and are structurally unable to emancipate themselves from their peripheral position.
1.2.10.3.1.7.2.3.1. Pro: Due to better resources and more experiences, Western countries [dominate international trade negotiations](https://www.iatp.org/files/WTO_Decision-Making_and_Developing_Countries.htm) and usually succeed in getting favourable terms.
1.2.10.3.1.7.2.3.2. Pro: Dependency theory argues that poor countries are underdeveloped for [structural reasons](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/depend.htm): They export primary commodities to the rich countries, who then manufacture products that they sell back to developing countries. Due to the high mark-up, poorer countries can never earn enough from their export to pay for their imports.
1.2.10.3.1.7.2.3.2.1. Pro: This problem continues today and is reflected in the inability of many developing countries to emancipate themselves from growth based on the [sale of resources](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-africa-investment/africa-is-still-way-too-dependent-on-resources-idUSBRE93P0HX20130426) or [cheap labour](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/will-chinas-shift-to-a-consumer-oriented-economy-succeed/).
1.2.10.3.1.7.3. Pro: Chinese state-owned companies that set up shop in Namibia were accused of paying Namibians one third the minimum wage, and employing Chinese workers for unskilled jobs that by law should have gone to Namibians. Chinese companies that invest under the direction of their state [break labour laws](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/magazine/is-china-the-worlds-new-colonial-power.html?mcubz=3&_r=1) in order to raise their own profits.
1.2.10.3.1.7.4. Con: Chinese aid [imposes no political conditions](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/how-does-chinese-foreign-assistance-compare-to-that-of-developed-countries/) on recipient states, making it an attractive option.
1.2.10.3.1.7.5. Con: Chinese aid is becoming [increasingly similar](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/how-does-chinese-foreign-assistance-compare-to-that-of-developed-countries/) to aid provided by the Development Assistance Committee \(DAC\), especially in terms of improving transparency. Eventually, those who accepted aid from democratic states will likely accept it from China.
1.2.10.4. Con: Foreign aid does not cause democratic reforms, it simply reinforces already ongoing domestic developments - both towards more democratic and more authoritarian politics.
1.2.10.4.1. Pro: It is unrealistic to assume that any dictator would implement democratic reforms and risk losing everything only for the slim hope of receiving some development aid in the distant future.
1.2.10.4.2. Pro: Receiving development aid strengthens already dominant political coalitions by enabling them to produce tangible results, expand their influence and stay in power. Hence, aid will only push democratisation if those in power are already working towards it - otherwise, it will simply strengthen dictators.
1.2.10.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.6.
1.2.10.5. Pro: Building a democracy takes time.
1.2.10.5.1. Pro: In 2004, the administrator of the UN Development Program [stated](https://www.theglobalist.com/democracy-as-a-long-term-project/) that 'democracy takes time - certainly years, probably decades'.
1.2.10.5.2. Pro: It took [well over a century](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/general-election-2017-magna-carta-universal-suffrage-1000-year/) for the UK to democratise and establish the relevant institutions. While democratisation can take place faster today, by no means is it an overnight process.
1.3. Con: Unconditional foreign assistance is vital to achieving peace and stability in non-democratic recipient states.
1.3.1. Pro: Significant decreases in aid revenues can lead to an aid shock; this can shift political power relations and possibly induce a violent conflict \([Nielsen et al., p. 219](http://www.mit.edu/~rnielsen/Nielsen%20et%20al%202011.pdf)\).
1.3.1.1. Pro: When the level of aid to Mali was drastically reduced in 1989, it weakened the government and prevented them from providing sufficient assistance to the Taureg. As a result, they broke out in armed rebellion against the government \([Nielsen et al., p. 219](http://www.mit.edu/~rnielsen/Nielsen%20et%20al%202011.pdf)\).
1.3.1.2. Pro: An aid shock correlates with an increased probability of conflict. Liberia \(1999\), Ghana \(1981\), Guinea-Bissau \(1997\), and Sierra Leone \(1990\) all experienced armed conflict one year after an aid shock, and Lesotho \(1994\) experienced violence within four years \([Nielsen et al., p. 225](http://www.mit.edu/~rnielsen/Nielsen%20et%20al%202011.pdf)\).
1.3.1.3. Con: If democratisation conditions are not met, aid can be taken away gradually, rather than suddenly. This should give recipient states enough time to adapt to decreasing levels of aid, reducing the possibility of armed conflicts.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: It is likely that even if aid is taken away slowly that it will lead to destabilisation in recipient states.
1.3.2. Pro: Recipient states can use unconditional aid to prevent rebellions and mass civil conflict.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Governments can 'buy out' potential rebels by 'committing a sufficient flow of resources to make them unwilling to seek more through fighting'. If foreign aid is made conditional on democratisation, recipient states may not have sufficient funds to hold off a rebellion \([Nielsen et al., p. 221](http://www.mit.edu/~rnielsen/Nielsen%20et%20al%202011.pdf)\).
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: After a decrease in fungible aid, recipient states can no longer commit adequate resources to buying off potential rebels. In such a scenario, the expected payoff to rebels of fighting the state increases, increasing the likelihood of outbreak of violence.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Recipient states may invest foreign aid resources in order to deter potential rebels from fighting by raising the probability of a government military victory \([Nielsen et al., p. 221](http://www.mit.edu/~rnielsen/Nielsen%20et%20al%202011.pdf)\). Without unconditional aid to increase government resources, potential rebels may see fighting the state as a risk worth taking.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.3.2.3. Con: Equally, recipient states can use fungible foreign aid to suppress their population and prevent legitimate grievances from being raised.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Often times, a rebellion is necessary to depose undemocratic and corrupt states, as was the case in [Tunisia](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/16/tunisia-first-arab-revolution-ben-ali), [Romania](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2097426_2097427_2097428,00.html), [Serbia](http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/serbians-overthrow-milosevic-bulldozer-revolution-2000), and the [Philippines](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-35526200/how-filipino-people-power-toppled-dictator-marcos).
1.3.3. Con: Prioritising stability over democracy entrenches dictatorships. This worsens the lives of people on the ground and raises the possibility of a destructive uprising in the long run.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Although stable, many dictatorships in the Middle East were unbearable for many of the people living there.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Yet [Libyans](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/regrets-of-a-revolution-libya-after-qaddafi/), [Egyptians](http://www.gallup.com/poll/164015/egyptians-life-worse-mubarak-fall.aspx), [Syrians](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2016/3/14/the-feeling-of-guilt-engulfing-syrias-revolutionaries) and [Yemenis](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/in-yemen-everyday-life-goes-from-bad-to-worse/) either feel that life was better under their former dictators or regret starting their revolutions. In order to prevent such destruction of states and worsening of lives of people, donor states should commit to unconditional foreign aid.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: In Libya, Gaddafi managed a regime [responsible](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-protest-abuses-idUSTRE71L1NH20110222) for arbitrary detentions and disappearances, televised hangings, and mass killings in prison.
1.3.3.1.3. Pro: Minorities were a constant target of persecution in Hosni Mubarak's [Egypt](http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/02/04/anatomy-of-a-dictatorship-hosni-mubarak/), and women were constant victims of sexual abuse, harassment, and assault by government security forces.
1.3.3.1.4. Pro: Ali Abdullah Saleh, in Yemen, [entrenched](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/23/world/meast/yemen-saleh-profile/index.html) sectraian and tribal rivalries for his benefit, contributing to sectarian violence still seen in the country today.
1.3.3.2. Con: The stable, if brutal, regime of a dictator is far [better](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/why-keeping-a-dictator-is-often-better-than-instability-a-996101.html) than the anarchy that comes with failed revolutions. Foreign aid should be aimed at avoiding such situations.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: State instability has been found to have a positive relationship with terrorism \([Fahey, p. 186](http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/10789/Fahey_umd_0117E_11429.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)\).
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: Such political instability fosters extremist organisations, escalating existing conflict \([Campos and Gassebner, p. 10](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/35507/1/597846480.pdf)\).
1.3.3.2.2.1. Pro: In states where armed conflict exists, terror organisations are able to gain the military and organisational skills required to take part in insurgencies.
1.3.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.
1.3.4. Pro: Democratization potentially encourages ethnic and other cleavages. As a result, the process can create instability and hinder development \([Samarasinghe, p. 19](https://de.scribd.com/document/88608861/Democracy-and-Democratization-in-Developing-Countries-Samarasinghe)\).
1.3.5. Pro: Fragile and conflict-affected states provide an enabling environment for terrorism. Foreign aid can be used to improve the stability, and therefore anti-terror efforts, of these nations.
1.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.
1.3.5.2. Con: As the interests of donor states are at stake, even if aid provided to tackle terrorism is spent elsewhere by recipient states, donor states will continue to provide aid. Unconditional aid simply provides more funds to regimes that they can use for their own interests.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: Some states have an incentive to play up a domestic security threat in order to receive more fungible aid that they can divert towards other ends, such as countering a military rival state \([Boutton, p. 3](http://www.andrewboutton.com/uploads/2/0/8/8/20883260/boutton_rivalry.pdf)\).
1.3.5.3. Con: US counterterrorism aid creates perverse incentives for host states to maintain terrorist activity at low levels so as to continue receiving assistance to combat it \([Bapat](http://www.andrewboutton.com/uploads/2/0/8/8/20883260/boutton_rivalry.pdf)\). Counter-terrorism aid, if provided, should be made conditional in order to increase its effectiveness.
1.3.5.3.1. Con: However, cutting aid could lead to the collapse of the recipient state or the state cutting a deal with the terrorist group. Providing fungible aid, while not a perfect solution, is still the best option available to donor states.
1.3.5.3.1.1. Con: Negotiating with terrorists is not necessarily a bad thing if it brings an end to violent conflict; and if unconditional aid does in fact run the risk of incentivizing host states to maintain terrorist activity, then negotiation is a far better option.
1.3.5.4. Pro: Foreign aid can [assist](http://theconversation.com/aid-not-war-can-foreign-aid-projects-help-improve-national-security-76369) in alleviating poverty and building sustainable communities, providing a less conducive environment for [recruitment](http://time.com/3694305/poverty-terrorism/) in terrorist organisations.
1.3.5.5. Pro: Foreign aid can be used to [improve](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-18/bergin-we-must-use-foreign-aid-to-tackle-terrorism/6704634) the security of terror-struck nations, minimising the threat of terrorism.
1.4. Pro: Tying development assistance to a free democratic basic order is the strong preference of the majority of donor countries' citizens. As they are the ones who have to fund development aid, taxpayers' opinion should be seriously taken into consideration.
1.4.1. Pro: As of 2007, 61% of Americans believe that aid should be tied to a country's efforts to promote democratic government \([CFR, p. 21](https://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/USPOPCH15Development.pdf)\).
1.4.1.1. Con: As of 2007, more Americans stated in a poll that development aid should be tied to recipient countries' efforts at fighting poverty and corruption \(80%/83%\) than at promoting democracy \(61%\). Other goals, thus, are seen as more important in the largest of all donor countries \([CFR, p. 20f.](https://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/USPOPCH15Development.pdf)\).
1.4.1.1.1. Con: The promotion of democracy and the fight against poverty and corruption usually go hand in hand.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.6.7.
1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.
1.4.1.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.4.10.
1.4.1.2. Con: This does not mean that voters want to give aid only to democracies. It merely shows that they want to give it to countries that move in a democratic direction.
1.4.2. Con: Democracy is not the most important factor according to voters in donor states.
1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Even in Europe, democracy is not seen as the only factor that aid should be tied to. In a 2007 poll, 82% of respondents from various European countries supported the link between aid and democracy - but even more supported tying it to efforts against corruption and poverty \([CfR, p. 20f.](https://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/USPOPCH15Development.pdf)\).
1.4.2.2.1. Con: This is not an argument against tying aid to democracy, but simply to take people's other preferences into account. It is perfectly reasonable to tie aid to democracy, anti-corruption and poverty reduction.
1.4.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.1.
1.4.2.3. Pro: As of 2011, only 3% of respondents in a poll in South Korea saw the promotion of democracy as a reason for giving aid; numerous other goals were seen as far more important \([Kwon/Park, p. 67](http://www.keia.org/sites/default/files/publications/kei_koreaseconomy_10_kwonyulparksukyung.pdf)\).
1.4.3. Pro: The 'Eurobaromter' \(2011\), with more than 25,000 citizens from 27 European countries, found that over 80% of respondents want development aid to be conditional on democracy and human rights \([Eurobaromter, p. 28](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/ebs/ebs_375_en.pdf)\).
1.4.3.1. Pro: [More than two thirds](https://europa.eu/european-union/topics/development-cooperation_en) of all ODA comes from the European Union and its members.
1.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.4.2.2.
1.4.4. Pro: Democracies should act as role models and act democratically according to the majority's wish.
1.4.4.1. Con: Governments in democracies do not have to act in accordance with public opinion on every issue. They have a mandate to act as they see fit, even if this goes against the public's opinion.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Voters may have an opinion on every issue, but they must also prioritise the issues they care most about when voting. If voters prioritised conditional aid, their governments might listen, but if voters prioritise other issues, the government can act as it sees fit.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: The vast majority of democracies in the world operate as representative democracies rather than absolute democracies. In a representative democracy, candidates are elected to make decisions in line with their own conscience and not merely to respond uncritically to public opinion.
1.4.4.2. Con: The moral course of action is not always the one that the public decides. Doing the correct thing makes the democratic state a better role model.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Most people in the UK supported the death penalty until [recently](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32061822). The government was arguably still right to abolish it in the 60's.
1.4.5. Con: Governments often disregard their citizens' opinions, even on issues that involve larger chunks of their budgets than is spent on official development aid. It is consistent for these governments to push their own agendas with regards to aid.
1.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.1.2.
1.4.5.2. Con: Governments should not disregard citizens' opinions in this way, and just because they do in other areas it does not mean it is permissible for them to do so in the area of foreign aid.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: [Trust in politicians](https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/04/verify-then-trust) is currently at an all time low, and a large part of this is because voters feel that their elected representatives do not listen to them. This phenomenon goes hand in hand with a [low voter turnout](http://blogs.uta.fi/contre/2016/03/24/political-trust-and-voter-turnout-go-hand-in-hand/).
1.4.5.3. Pro: A [survey](http://time.com/4253842/defense-spending-obama-congress-poll-voters/) from 2016 came to the conclusion that the majority of US voters are for defense cuts. However, the US military budget reached a new ['historic' amount](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-budget-idUSKBN1661R2) of $603 billion in 2017.
1.4.6. Con: Excluding those undecided, seven in ten Britons want to [scrap](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/22/twice-as-many-british-voters-want-to-scrap-07-gdp-aid-pledge-tha/) Britain’s commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of its GDP on foreign aid.
1.4.6.1. Con: The results can be the opposite, [depending on how the question is posed](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/how-popular-is-foreign-aid-spending-it-depends-how-you-ask-the-question-9972216.html). One survey found '67 per cent of people in the UK said that “we should keep our promise to increase aid to developing countries” \(54 per cent\), or that “we should increase aid to developing countries beyond what is already promised” \(13 per cent\)'.
1.4.7. Con: Democratic governments are elected to make decisions in the interests of voters and the nation as a whole. There are good reasons to assume that public opinion does not necessarily represent these interests and indicate what decisions a government should make.
1.4.7.1. Pro: It is difficult for a voter to see how foreign aid benefits them, but this is not a reason for their government to eschew the benefits of giving aid.
1.4.7.2. Pro: Voters are largely uninformed or misinformed about the realities of foreign aid.
1.4.7.2.1. Pro: Once Americans realised how much was actually spent on foreign aid, support for increasing foreign aid [leapt](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/informed-public-opinion-about-foreign-policy-the-uses-of-deliberative-polling/) from 20 percent to 53 percent, a majority.
1.4.7.2.2. Pro: According to [polls](http://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/poll-finding/data-note-americans-views-on-the-u-s-role-in-global-health/), only one in twenty Americans knows that the United States spends about 1% of its GDP on foreign aid. The average estimate of the number is 26%.
1.4.7.2.3. Pro: Australians estimated [in surveys](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/29/australians-massively-overestimate-level-of-foreign-aid-in-budget-poll-finds), on average, that their country spends 13% of its GDP on foreign aid. The real number stands at less than 1%.
1.4.7.2.4. Pro: As of 2006, British people estimated on average that their government spends 19% of its GDP on foreign aid. The real number stood at 1.3% at the time \([ActionAid, p. 3](https://www.actionaid.org.uk/sites/default/files/doc_lib/poll_summary.pdf)\).
1.4.7.2.5. Con: As researchers caution, the high estimates of GDP shares may be the result of question design. If respondents would be asked to estimate the spending as share of GDP for various areas with a cumulative limit of 100%, the numbers assigned to foreign aid might be more realistic \([Milner/Tingley, p. 391](https://scholar.harvard.edu/dtingley/publications/public-opinion-and-foreign-aid-review-essay)\).
1.4.7.2.6. Pro: Only a third of Americans have ever heard of USAid, their country's own organization for international development. Even among college graduates this number increases to only 54% \([Milner/Tingley, p. 392](https://scholar.harvard.edu/dtingley/publications/public-opinion-and-foreign-aid-review-essay)\).
1.4.7.3. Pro: Tying the willingness to give development assistance to preferences of the electorate and the public opinion is hazardous, as those can be subject to frequent change and high volatility.
1.4.8. Pro: If people feel that their tax money is propping up oppressive regimes, they may feel less supportive of aid efforts in general and vote to cut foreign aid across the board, which would hurt both democratic and non-democratic regimes that benefit from aid.
1.4.8.1. Pro: It is very easy for the [media](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2019890/Billions-aid-Britain-used-fund-lavish-lifestyle-dictators.html) to stir up [outrage](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/832180/New-foreign-aid-outrage-scandal-money-dictator-Rwanda) about aid being 'given to dictators'. This damages public opinion of aid in general.
1.4.8.1.1. Con: The media tends to stir up outrage against foreign aid regardless of whether the recipient country is democratic or dictatorial. It will still find it very easy to do so even if aid is only sent to democratic countries, so it is unclear what effect this policy will actually have on the media's reporting on aid.
1.4.8.1.1.1. Pro: Outrage concerning aid is often generated by media through focusing on the amount of money spent on it. In Britain, [the Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4394366/Britain-s-bloated-foreign-aid-budget-spotlight.html) is currently running a campaign advocating for the abolition of a provision mandating the government to spend 0.7% of national income on aid, and has started a petition to that effect which has gained [over 200,000 signatures](https://petition.parliament.uk/archived/petitions/125692).
1.4.8.1.1.2. Pro: The media generates outrage about aid by portraying it as a waste of money spent on frivolous causes. Earlier this year, the UK pulled funding from a women's rights programme in Ethiopia called ['Girl Effect'](http://www.humanosphere.org/world-politics/2017/01/u-k-buckles-under-tabloid-pressure-cuts-funds-to-ethiopian-girls-program/) after a tabloid campaign described it as 'Ethiopia's version of the Spice Girls'.
1.5. Con: By making development assistance conditional on democratization, donor states run the risk of losing out on a potential source of influence over recipient states to protect important strategic interests.
1.5.1. Pro: Pushing developing countries towards taking unconditional assistance from other, likely authoritarian countries makes democratization less likely in the long run.
1.5.1.1. Con: China is often cast as the most prominent example of an authoritarian country providing aid as an alternative to aid from democracies. However, the aid China offers is not unconditional, it just has a different emphasis and still makes demands of authoritarian regimes. It is unclear why these demands would be more appealing to developing countries than the ones made by democracies.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Chinese aid is mostly [tied aid](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/908c24f2-2343-11dc-9e7e-000b5df10621.html?ft_site=falcon&desktop=true): it requires infrastructure construction and other contracts to be divided up, with 70 per cent going to “approved”, mostly state-owned, Chinese companies and the rest handed to local firms, many of which are also in joint ventures with Chinese groups
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: China has traditionally seen aid as a [policy instrument](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2015/10/08/the-domestic-controversy-over-chinas-foreign-aid-and-the-implications-for-africa/) to cement political friendships and facilitate China’s political agenda at multilateral forums. Even if there are no explicit conditions attached, China expects some political favours in return.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: China tends to give more aid to countries that [align with it politically](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/10-essential-facts-about-chinese-aid-africa-14456?page=2), for example by consistently voting alongside China in the UN General Assembly. While not explicit, political support of China on the international forum is an implicit condition.
1.5.1.1.3. Con: The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is already aiming to become a better lender than the World Bank, with fewer strings attached to its loans. Western institutions cutting off aid to non-democracies will only serve to push the latter towards such banks even more.
1.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: China is [prepared](https://www.ft.com/content/3a938ee4-0288-11e7-aa5b-6bb07f5c8e12) to give up its de-facto veto in the Bank, something the US is unprepared to do in the IMF.
1.5.1.1.3.2. Pro: The World Bank and IMF are criticised for imposing an unreasonable number of conditions on loans, conditions which are often incredibly difficult to fulfil \([Eurodad Report, p. 3](http://www.eurodad.org/uploadedfiles/whats_new/reports/eurodad_world_bank_and_imf_conditionality_report.pdf)\). The Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank does [not](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aiib-china-loans/exclusive-chinas-aiib-to-offer-loans-with-fewer-strings-attached-sources-idUSKCN0R14UB20150901) insist on such conditions.
1.5.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Although loans will require projects to be legally transparent and protect social and environmental interests, they will [not](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aiib-china-loans/exclusive-chinas-aiib-to-offer-loans-with-fewer-strings-attached-sources-idUSKCN0R14UB20150901) require borrowers to privatise or deregulate businesses.
1.5.1.1.3.3. Pro: The Bank [won't delay project approval by months](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/timeline/World/1267/14608/aiib-challenging-the-bretton-woods-system/amp/IAC) to allow all parties to do due diligence, a practice in place at most other development banks. This allows for faster and more efficient loan payments.
1.5.1.1.3.4. Con: Although the conditions of the loans may be less stringent, not everyone will receive those loans. The Bank has so far mostly given out [strategic loans](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahsu/2017/01/14/how-chinas-asian-infrastructure-investment-bank-fared-its-first-year/#6a331375a7f0) that help further China's soft power and help further its  One Belt One Road \(OBOR\) policy.
1.5.1.2. Pro: This is especially pertinent in light of the emergence of new institutions such as the BRICS [New Development Bank](https://qz.com/947981/new-development-bank-ndb-the-brics-may-be-sputtering-but-its-bank-is-keeping-the-dream-alive/) and China's [Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahsu/2017/01/14/how-chinas-asian-infrastructure-investment-bank-fared-its-first-year/#ee9df2a5a7f0). Attaching conditions to aid from institutions such as the World Bank is likely to push developing countries away from it now that an alternative exists, meaning that a large amount of influence that could be used to aid democratisation in developing countries would be lost.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: By the end of 2016, the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank \(AIIB\) had lent just over $2bn. This is a [mere fraction](https://www.ft.com/content/3a938ee4-0288-11e7-aa5b-6bb07f5c8e12) compared the amount the World Bank and other western-backed multilateral development banks lend: they had $700bn in loans outstanding at the end of 2014. The AIIB is not a substitute of the World Bank.
1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: The same article mentions the ability of the bank to lend up to $250bn in the next few years. That is the [same amount](https://www.ft.com/content/3a938ee4-0288-11e7-aa5b-6bb07f5c8e12) as the World Bank.
1.5.1.2.1.2. Con: This was the first year of the Bank's operations, during which it had to build credit reliability and credibility in the international organisation. Over time, there is no reason why it won't be able to compete with the World Bank or the IMF.
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.3.
1.5.1.2.3. Pro: The New Development Bank \(NDB\) is determined to be a '[bank of projects](http://www.eurodad.org/Entries/view/1546242/2014/07/18/A-major-political-move-the-BRICS-launch-the-New-Development-Bank-and-a-reserve-arrangement)', not a 'bank of policies'. This is in contrast to the traditional practice of the World to influence developing country governments’ policies through the conditions attached to its lending. Such a difference makes the NDB more attractive than the World Bank to begin with.
1.5.1.2.3.1. Con: The NDB has a capital base of $100bn, [less than half](https://internationalbanker.com/banking/can-brics-new-development-bank-compete-world-bank-imf/) of the World Bank's $232bn, so it is unlikely that they can compete completely with the World Bank.
1.5.1.2.3.1.1. Con: NDB does not need to be a complete substitute of the World Bank; it just needs to attract non-democratic states looking for assistance, for which $100bn is enough.
1.5.1.2.3.1.2. Con: As the NDB becomes a more successful and influential actor, the states that fund it would presumably also be willing to gradually increase its overall capitalisation.
1.5.1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: The NDB's prospects are unclear as three of its five founding members are economically not in good shape: South Africa's economy [is stalling](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/24/why-south-africas-economic-outlook-is-looking-bleak.html), Russia's economy recovering from contraction and [growing slowly](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-economy/russian-economic-growth-upgraded-inflation-seen-slowing-reuters-poll-idUSKCN1BC46K?il=0), and Brazil's GDP has been [declining for years](https://www.oecd.org/eco/outlook/brazil-economic-forecast-summary.htm).
1.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.3.1.2.3.
1.5.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.3.1.6.
1.5.1.5. Con: If the assistance given by authoritarian states leads to economic development, this might - nevertheless - lead towards democratization in the long run.
1.5.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.2.
1.5.2. Pro: Historically, aid has only been withdrawn when the donor state has not had pressing strategic or business reasons that override interest in promoting democracy in the recipient \([Boulding & Hyde, p. 29](http://citation.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/7/8/8/pages87880/p87880-29.php)\). This suggests that aid is vital to maintaining influence over states.
1.5.3. Con: This attitude should be rejected as it prioritizes the economic and political interests of rich countries above the reduction of poverty and sustainable development in poor countries; it is neo-imperalist and lies at the bottom of the development failures of past and present \([Hahn, p. 143](http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/11143/1/Hahn-vol13n2.pdf)\).
1.5.3.1. Pro: Arguably it’s another form of oppression,  it imposes western values of democracy and democratic morals regardless of the people in that country's views are on alternative ways to govern.
1.5.4. Con: As democracies have a strong natural interest in the international system's democratization, making democracy a condition for their support is a direct way to achieve this goal.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Democratization of recipient-countries is beneficial for the donors' economies.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Democratisation often results in [economic liberalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy), providing the donor state with access to the recipient state's markets.
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.
1.5.4.1.3. Pro: Research suggests that democracies [trade more](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2647734?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) and are [less likely](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3877880?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) to utilize trade barriers. This serves the interest of rich countries in the maintenance of an open economic order and the creation of global markets.
1.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.5.4.3. Pro: The past years have seen refugee flows from authoritarian countries [towards democracies](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/10/the-refugees-arent-fleeing-democracy-european-union-syria/). For the purpose of curbing these movements, it is therefore in the interest of rich states to promote democracy abroad.
1.5.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.
1.5.5. Con: Promotion of democracy is an important normative justification for garnering public support for foreign aid in donor countries. Making aid conditional on democratisation strengthens the donor countries' commitment to this normative justification, hence reducing public opposition to such aid programs \([Boulding and Hyde, p. 13](http://citation.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/7/8/8/pages87880/p87880-13.php)\).
1.5.5.1. Pro: If such aid programs promote foreign policy objectives of donor countries, then reducing public opposition to them should be the central objective of any donor state.
1.5.6. Pro: Making aid conditional on democratisation negatively influences the reputation of donor states.
1.5.6.1. Pro: A declining reputation has negative effects on the donor countries' [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power#Measurement) and thus limits a potential way to achieve preferred political or economic outcomes.
1.5.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.
1.5.6.2. Pro: Providing assistance exclusively to democracies is an indirect appeal to democratize and can be regarded as a form of [international aid paternalism](http://encyclopedia.uia.org/en/problem/133236): it is based on the impression that donor states have a superior knowledge of what is best for recipient states.
1.5.6.3. Con: The reputation of a country that makes aid conditional on democracy might actually profit in many - and the most relevant - places as other rich countries perceive this policy as beneficial for the spread of democracy.
1.5.6.4. Con: Rich countries have little to gain from a good reputation in poor countries.
1.5.6.4.1. Pro: Reputation and soft power have been linked to the idea of nation branding, and to a country's attractiveness as a destination for tourism and investment. Poor countries are a source of neither tourism nor investment \([Fan, p. 16](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.426.8323&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\).
1.5.6.5. Con: What can actually harm the reputation of rich countries is the perception that their aid props up non-democratic regimes, and that their aid is therefore farcical.
1.5.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.5.
1.5.7. Pro: Most recipient states are not likely to meet the democratisation conditions attached with foreign aid. Since most under-developed or developing countries are not considered to be [democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index), conditional development assistance would significantly reduce the influence of democratic states on non-democratic states.
1.5.7.1. Pro: The distribution of development assistance is an important way to achieve political goals. Conditional aid narrows this option.
1.5.7.1.1. Pro: Foreign aid can discourage the recipient state from moving out of the sphere of influence of the donor state, or, if the recipient state is non-aligned, from moving into a rival's sphere of influence \([McKinlay and Little, p. 62](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2010075?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=A&searchText=Foreign&searchText=Policy&searchText=Model&searchText=of&searchText=U.S.&searchText=Bilateral&searchText=Aid&searchText=Allocation&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3Fwc%3Don%26amp%3BQuery%3DA%2BForeign%2BPolicy%2BModel%2Bof%2BU.S.%2BBilateral%2BAid%2BAllocation%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dcontrol%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bacc%3Don&refreqid=search%3A098439e4f3649e5c15e308cf43260177&seq=5#page_scan_tab_contents)\).
1.5.7.1.2. Pro: Countries receiving loans from the IMF, which is largely controlled by G7 countries as its major shareholders, are more likely to vote in line with the G7 countries in the UN General Assembly [\(Dreher and Sturm, p. 364\)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11127-010-9750-2.pdf). If making aid conditional on democratisation resulted in the withdrawal of aid, the G7 countries would suffer a loss of influence in international politics.
1.5.7.1.3. Pro: At times, donor states have to support recipient states in order to further regional security interests. Support of democratisation does not always trump other foreign policy interests.
1.5.7.1.3.1. Pro: The US has [provided](http://www.ips.org.pk/security-and-foreign-policy/1080-us-aid-to-pakistan-and-democracy.html) high levels of foreign aid to dictatorships but low or negligible levels of aid to democracies in Pakistan. Supporting Pakistan in the fight against the USSR in Afghanistan in the 1980s and the War on Terror in the 2000's were clearly more important than democratisation.
1.5.7.1.3.2. Pro: The US has [provided](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/09/the-u-s-gives-egypt-1-5-billion-a-year-in-aid-heres-what-it-does/?utm_term=.0b0f85b7e0dd) Egypt with the second highest amount of foreign aid after Israel since 1987 - Egypt has been a dictatorship since then for all but 13 months. They provide aid in order to maintain US access to the Suez Canal and maintain the Egypt-Israel peace treaty.
1.5.7.1.3.3. Pro: The US has [provided](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/12/13/with-small-changes-u-s-maintains-military-aid-to-saudi-arabia-despite-rebukes-over-yemen-carnage/?utm_term=.fcd7d62d18ed) Saudi Arabia with $58 billion of aid between 2009 and 2015 in order to have [influence](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/01/why-the-us-is-stuck-with-saudi-arabia/384805/) over the largest exporter of oil in the world, and the most important member of OPEC, the bloc that controls 40 percent of the worlds oil.
1.5.7.1.3.4. Pro: The US has [funded](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/20/mapped-the-7-governments-the-u-s-has-overthrown/) the overthrow of multiple democratically elected regimes and supported the subsequent dictators who took power, all in order to further regional security interests. Foreign aid was dramatically increased in the aftermath of the coups.
1.5.7.1.3.5. Pro: The EU has [collaborated](http://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2016/05/europe-s-secret-deal-africa-s-dictators) with African dictators in order to prevent refugees from Africa reaching Europe.
1.5.7.1.3.6. Pro: Development aid is often provided in [exchange](http://access to military bases and strategic natural resources, diplomatic ties) for conditions like access to military bases and strategic natural resources. Conditional development aid blocks these kind of deals with many countries.
1.5.7.1.4. Pro: During the [Cold War](https://sites.tufts.edu/jha/archives/75) the USA used development assistance to solidify alliances and to gain access to territories in order to contain Soviet Communism.
1.5.7.1.5. Pro: Developing countries of [particular geo-strategic](http://voxeu.org/article/foreign-aid-and-growth-new-evidence) importance \(measured by the UNSC\) receive considerably more assistance.
1.5.7.2. Pro: This reduces the ability of donor states to influence the economy of the recipient states.
1.5.7.2.1. Pro: By increasing purchasing power and driving growth in less developed countries, development aid promotes exports and employment in developed donor countries.
1.5.7.2.1.1. Con: Yet this capital could be spent directly at home to improve the standard of living of developed countries.
1.5.7.2.2. Pro: As demand for aid is in excess, donor states obtain considerable leverage and influence over recipient states. This often takes two forms: 'program aid', which entails intervention in the donor states economic policy, or 'project aid', which entails future dependence on the recipient state for provision of that particular project \([McKinlay and Little, p. 63](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2010075?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=A&searchText=Foreign&searchText=Policy&searchText=Model&searchText=of&searchText=U.S.&searchText=Bilateral&searchText=Aid&searchText=Allocation&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3Fwc%3Don%26amp%3BQuery%3DA%2BForeign%2BPolicy%2BModel%2Bof%2BU.S.%2BBilateral%2BAid%2BAllocation%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dcontrol%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bacc%3Don&refreqid=search%3A098439e4f3649e5c15e308cf43260177&seq=6#page_scan_tab_contents)\).
1.5.7.2.3. Pro: 'Business involvement in a recipient country can provide incentives to value stability over democracy in order not to threaten investments of donor-country voters' \([Boulding and Hyde, p. 15](http://citation.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/7/8/8/pages87880/p87880-15.php)\).
1.5.7.2.4. Pro: [About 30%](https://sites.tufts.edu/jha/archives/75) of foreign aid is tied aid - aid that has to be spent in one or a group of donor countries in order to maintain and intensify political and economic relations.
1.5.7.2.4.1. Pro: The US provide direct military assistance, e.g.[for Egypt](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/opinion/global/egypts-economy-of-dependence.html), to enable the acquisition of American military equipment and vehicles.
1.5.7.3. Pro: Maintaining good relationships with non-democratic regimes often happens through foreign aid. Risking this relationship by making aid conditional on democratisation risks damaging or losing that relationship.
1.5.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.7.1.1.
1.5.7.3.2. Pro: China is already an influential actor, providing [$60 billion](https://qz.com/565819/chinas-xi-jinping-pledges-60-billion-to-help-africa-solve-its-problems-its-own-way/) for African development projects over a period of three years, starting in 2015. If the West makes aid conditional - and thereby losing partner countries - this would strongly increase China's influence at the cost of Western democracies.
1.5.7.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.3.1.5.
1.5.7.3.2.2. Pro: The unconditional provision of development aid combined with a non-interference principle into the recipients' domestic affairs enables [China](http://harvardpolitics.com/world/shifting-tides-sino-african-relations-case-south-sudan/), as an authoritarian regime, to increase its legitimacy and international recognition.
1.5.7.3.2.3. Pro: Additionally, [China's economic activities](http://harvardpolitics.com/world/shifting-tides-sino-african-relations-case-south-sudan/) in African countries are critical: since 2009, China has been the largest trading partner on the continent.
1.5.7.3.2.4. Con: When put into its international context, Chinese aid is [relatively insignificant](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2016/07/19/chinese-foreign-assistance-explained/): In 2013, it accounted for less than 4% of aid given globally and its total amount is less than 7% of the total aid given by members of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee.
1.5.8. Con: Supporting non-democratic regimes potentially jeopardizes the donors' security and consequently the donors' interests.
1.5.8.1. Pro: Terrorist groups are more likely to arise in non-democratic states.
1.5.8.1.1. Pro: Participatory institutions and civil liberties provided by democracies potentially undercut the public support for terrorists \([Crenshaw, p. 383](http://www.jstor.org/stable/421717?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=The&searchText=Causes&searchText=of&searchText=Terrorism&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DThe%2BCauses%2Bof%2BTerrorism%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dcontrol&refreqid=search%3A0adb8bf94d42eb69ee52b0e9df546fe2&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\).
1.5.8.1.2. Pro: The vast majority of [terrorists' safe havens](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2013/224828.htm) are in non-democratic states.
1.5.8.1.2.1. Pro: [Terrorist networks](https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/jcs/article/view/216/374) flourish where states are governed badly - weak governmental institutions and high degree of corruption - as the examples of Pakistan, Yemen, Kenya and Guinea show.
1.5.8.1.3. Con: [Terrorists' safe havens](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2013/224828.htm) and breeding grounds of organizations like ISIS and Boko Haram are predominantly located in [weak](http://www.hoover.org/research/breeding-ground-terrorism), failing or failed-states. To prevent the breeding of terrorism, strong non-democratic states are more effective than weak democracies.
1.5.8.1.3.1. Con: [This study](https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/jcs/article/view/216/374) suggests that failed-states are not attractive for transnational criminals and terrorists for a variety of reasons: higher exposure to international counter-terrorist action; higher vulnerability to the most common crimes of chaos such as kidnapping, extortion, blackmail, and assassination; higher conspicuity of foreigners.
1.5.8.1.3.2. Pro: Terrorist groups [exploit](http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/152/html) the weakness of many African states to take safe harbour and launch terrorist attacks.
1.5.8.1.3.3. Pro: Pakistan, [a weak democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index), is [host](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/24/asia/pakistan-terrorism-crackdown/index.html) to a number of terrorist organisations.
1.5.8.1.3.4. Pro: Terrorist groups are [rampant](http://www.heritage.org/asia/report/southeast-asia-and-the-brotherhood-terrorism) in Southeast Asian nations, many of which are [weak democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index).
1.5.8.2. Pro: Compared to democratic states, autocracies are [more expansionist and more susceptible to conflicts and war](https://quote.ucsd.edu/lake/files/2014/07/APSR-86-1-1992.pdf).
1.5.9. Con: Public opinion in donor countries indicates that aid should not be given primarily out of self-interest.
1.5.9.1. Pro: As of 2011, more than half of South Koreans stated moral responsibilities and contributions to peace and stability as reasons why aid should be given. Only 20% named self-interest \([Kwon/Park, p. 67](http://www.keia.org/sites/default/files/publications/kei_koreaseconomy_10_kwonyulparksukyung.pdf)\).
1.5.9.2. Con: Eight out of ten Europeans responded to a 2011 poll saying that aid should also serve European objectives such as the management of migration flows and the access to energy and raw materials \([Eurobarometer, p. 31](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/ebs/ebs_375_en.pdf)\).
1.5.9.2.1. Con: These responses were given to a question starting with "In addition to fighting poverty". Thus, the data does not indicate that Europeans prefer to give aid out of self-interest.
1.5.9.3. Pro: According to a 2007 poll in the US and several European countries, the fight against poverty and health problems as well as the support of economic growth are seen as the most important reasons for giving aid to poor countries \([CfR, p. 8](https://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/USPOPCH15Development.pdf)\).
1.5.9.4. Pro: A majority of Americans are [against](https://www.brookings.edu/research/american-public-support-for-foreign-aid-in-the-age-of-trump/) aid that is linked to US hegemonic aspirations, but not humanitarian aid.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.6.
1.7. Con: Tying assistance to the conditions of democratization is immoral.
1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.
1.7.2. Pro: Conditional development assistance harms the poor in particular; those individuals are not responsible for the non-democratic nature of their government.
1.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.1.
1.7.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.4.1.
1.7.2.3. Pro: By making development aid conditional on democracy, at least 40% of the people living in extreme poverty would be cut off from development aid as their countries' governance is generally considered undemocratic \([World Bank, p. 4](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPROSPECTS/Resources/334934-1327948020811/8401693-1397074077765/Prosperity_for_All_Final_2014.pdf)\).
1.7.2.3.1. Pro: This problem is poised to grow: according to Freedom House, the past decade saw the number of not-free countries grow and the number of free countries decline. Overall, the number of countries in which democratic rights decline has been larger than the number of those where they improve \(Freedom [House, p. 4f.](https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf)\).
1.7.2.4. Pro: Making aid dependent on democracy adds insult to injustice: not only are the world's poor in a dire situation for which they bear no responsibility, they are also excluded from foreign aid for reasons beyond their responsibility.
1.7.2.5. Pro: Dictators will continue to [remain wealthy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2011/11/08/who-were-africas-richest-dictators/#757847ce1708) regardless of whether aid is given to their countries. Unconditional development aid is one of few mechanisms to ensure the trickle down of resources to the masses.
1.7.2.5.1. Pro: A large portion of the total wealth in undemocratic countries is concentrated in the highest levels of government. Politicians make [exorbitant amounts of money](https://buzzkenya.com/latest-salaries-top-ugandan-politicians-revealed/) compared to those employed in other industries. Most of this money comes from taxes or control of local industries, not from aid.
1.7.2.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.6.7.5.
1.7.2.5.1.2. Pro: Dictators across the world have managed to stay wealthy by engaging in activities such as [illegal trade](https://www.forbes.com/2000/06/22/feat.html), [investing and creating local monopolies](http://naibuzz.com/2014/05/03/uhuru-kenyatta-familys-wealth-and-list-of-businesses/) and[illegally acquiring land](http://www.thezimbabwean.co/2011/10/wikileaks-mugabe-assets-worth-over/).
1.7.2.5.2. Con: There is no guarantee that a sufficient amount of aid to make a difference will trickle down to those who need it. Funds marked for entire aid programs can be misappropriated.
1.7.2.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.4.1.2.
1.7.2.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.4.1.3.
1.7.2.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.4.1.4.
1.7.2.5.3. Con: Directing aid towards countries that do not misappropriate funds guarantees that more money reaches those who need it, rather than relying on the trickle down effect where hardly anything reaches the needy.
1.7.2.6. Con: Aid receiving governments often spend lavishly on 'show projects'. These include construction of new capitals, establishing international airlines that the poor have no need of, and shopping malls that the needy can't afford. Capital being spent on these projects does not assist the poor \([Bauer & Yamey, p. 308](http://faculty.nps.edu/relooney/BauerYameyAid.pdf)\).
1.7.2.6.1. Con: Insofar as construction requires hiring workers, etc., these projects may create jobs for the poor and unemployed.
1.7.2.6.1.1. Con: Jobs created under a democratic government would have fairer pay and working conditions than the ones under a non-democratic regime.
1.7.2.6.2. Con: These projects, and the subsequent consumption by the wealthy at these locations, will likely have a broader stimulus effect on the economy, lowering prices and making the poor better off.
1.7.3. Pro: Wealthy democracies owe an obligation to under-developed states, a significant number of which are non-democratic. This obligation is owed regardless of the form of government of recipient states.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Western developed countries owe restitution to under-developed countries for past and present wrongs, even if they are non-democratic regimes.
1.7.3.1.1. Pro: Former colonialist democracies are directly responsible for the economic and political situations in many developing countries.
1.7.3.1.1.1. Pro: Colonialism prevented [economic development](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2029575) in former colonies.
1.7.3.1.1.1.1. Con: In Africa, colonial governments built a substantial infrastructure, introduced education reforms as well as modern state systems \([Settles, p. 10](http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1182&context=utk_chanhonoproj)\).
1.7.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The infrastructure was mainly designed to exploit the countries' resources, and not to develop a strong economy on site \([Settles, p. 11](http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1182&context=utk_chanhonoproj)\).
1.7.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: The economies of colonies were made subservient to the interests of their colonial masters. This took the form of destroying local industries to eliminate competition, buying raw materials at cheap prices only to sell them back at high prices, or generally exploiting the labour force of colonies \([Olusegun & David, p. 6](http://www.garph.co.uk/IJARMSS/Aug2012/1.pdf)\) \([Settles, p. 2](http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1182&context=utk_chanhonoproj)\).
1.7.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: The European demand for African primary products, and the brutally self-interested way in which it was satisfied, led to a form of development which made the African economies heavily dependent on the metropolitan economies. This dependence lasted post independence, prohibiting the development and independence of many African economies \([Olusegun & David, p. 6/7](http://www.garph.co.uk/IJARMSS/Aug2012/1.pdf)\).
1.7.3.1.1.1.4. Con: [A study](http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2012/july/colonial-european-settlement-had-positive-effect-on-income-today-study-shows.html) found that European settlement during the colonial era positively influenced present day's per capita income by bringing scientific and technological knowledge, the institution of private property, capitalist markets, and democracy.
1.7.3.1.1.2. Pro: Former colonial masters carried out violent and brutal attacks against the populations of their colonies. They owe reparations for these actions.
1.7.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: British rule over India was [horrifically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qissa_Khwani_Bazaar_massacre) [violent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre).
1.7.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: Western states, especially the US, helped perpetuate and continue the [slave trade](http://www.nytimes.com/1860/12/08/news/the-united-states-and-spain-equally-responsible-for-the-african-slave-trade.html), leading to millions being removed from their homes and living in depraved conditions.
1.7.3.1.1.2.3. Pro: British economic policies in India resulted in [multiple](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-36339524) [famines](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-the-truth-our-empire-killed-millions-404631.html) during the nineteenth century, resulting in the death of as many as 29 million Indians.
1.7.3.1.1.2.4. Pro: Under the ['Free State rule'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrocities_in_the_Congo_Free_State#Population_decline) the Congolese were subjects to many atrocities: the population declined significantly.
1.7.3.1.1.3. Pro: The legacy of arbitrary borders left behind by colonial states contribute to conflict and political unrest in many parts of the developing world.
1.7.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: Post colonial borders introduced under the guidance of the West are the reason for [political unrest](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/the-great-divide-books-dalrymple) in the Indian Subcontinent.
1.7.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: The [arbitrary post-colonial borders](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/09/the-dividing-of-a-continent-africas-separatist-problem/262171/) introduced by the West are still reason for political unrests in Africa.
1.7.3.1.1.4. Pro: Former European colonial powers are responsible for the death of millions of people in their former colonies: while some succumbed to foreign disease, many were slaughtered, died of slavery or starved to death after being kicked off their land. In Latin America alone, between 1492 and the mid 1600's, the population was [slashed](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/nov/27/enough-of-aid-lets-talk-reparations) from between 50-100 million down to about 3.5 million.
1.7.3.1.1.5. Con: Reparations incriminate a generation that was not responsible.
1.7.3.1.2. Pro: The industries of wealthy democracies still benefit from exploiting developing nations.
1.7.3.1.2.1. Pro: Western companies take advantage of the degrading standards on site to maximize their profits, e.g. extremely long working hours in combination with low wages in the [technology sector](http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/miserable-working-conditions-human-rights-group-condemns-computer-manufacturers-a-596712.html) or the [textile industry](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/world/americas/buying-overseas-clothing-us-flouts-its-own-advice.html?_r=0).
1.7.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Studies conducted in developing as well as emerging countries like Bangladesh, Mexico, China, Indonesia and Vietnam came to the conclusion that multinational companies actually pay a ['wage premium'](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=8&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwisw5vgtKbVAhUEaRQKHRMBD5gQFghXMAc&url=https%3A%2F%2Facademiccommons.columbia.edu%2Fdownload%2Ffedora_content%2Fdownload%2Fac%3A156587%2FCONTENT%2F9854.pdf&usg=AFQjCNHfL61A8n7nAS5ObNV_Cz0sKQLmxQ) - a higher wage than the local average.
1.7.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: Most of H&M's factories in Bangladesh [still don't have working fire exits](https://qz.com/516038/report-most-of-hms-best-factories-in-bangladesh-still-dont-have-working-fire-exits/), despite the company having signed a pledge in 2013 to improve safety conditions after a factory collapse [killed over 1,000 workers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/rana-plaza-collapse-murder-charges-garment-factory).
1.7.3.1.2.1.3. Pro: Even after Apple [acknowledged](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/apple-admits-it-has-a-human-rights-problem-6898617.html) the human rights issues along their supply chain, campaigners for Chinese workers accused the company of engaging in public relations rather than really addressing the issues.
1.7.3.1.2.2. Pro: The West sends hundreds of thousands of tons of electronic and toxic waste to 'waste processing areas' in developing countries, circumventing the high regulation standards as well as the high financial costs that would occur in the homelands. The consequences for the local populations are fatal: exposure to toxic substances and increasing health risks, as is the case in [Ghana](http://www.worstpolluted.org/projects_reports/display/107).
1.7.3.1.2.3. Pro: International trade is predominantly to the advantage of developed nations.
1.7.3.1.2.3.1. Pro: Developing nations typically export unprocessed agricultural products, e.g.[cacao or coffee beans](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3372305.stm), free of tariffs. The processing and refinement and thus the creation of value are usually done in developed nations, where the real profits are made.
1.7.3.1.2.3.2. Con: To describe the integration of developing countries into the global economy as exploitation is only one perspective. This integration can also been seen as superior to the alternative: the international isolation of developing economies and even less economic activity.
1.7.3.1.2.4. Pro: For every $1 of aid a developing country receives, they lose $24 in [net outflow](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jan/14/aid-in-reverse-how-poor-countries-develop-rich-countries) to the developed world. Wealthy democracies owe, at least in part, their yearly growth to developing countries and so should help them.
1.7.3.1.2.4.1. Pro: In 2012, developing countries [lost $700 billion in illegal capital outflows](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jan/14/aid-in-reverse-how-poor-countries-develop-rich-countries). This money is stored in tax havens in Europe, the US and jurisdictions controlled by the UK. The developed world are directly to blame for this loss of capital, which they benefit from when the money is redirected into their economies via investments.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Article 25\(1\) of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) creates an obligation to provide everyone with an adequate standard of living - irrespective of the local political circumstances.
1.7.3.2.1. Pro: The UDHR is a foundational document of the international community and the United Nations that has informed national and regional legislation all over the world. Hence, all UN members have an obligation to comply with its contents.
1.7.3.2.2. Pro: By voting in favour of adopting the UDHR, [48 countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights#Adoption) committed themselves to upholding the values outlined in the UDHR.
1.7.3.2.3. Con: A rights-based approach to development aid is problematic. The provision of aid may live up to the rights guaranteed by Article 25. Yet it easily interferes with other rights, for example those that guarantee self-determination and a sustainable livelihood, and especially so if it creates a dependency of those in need on aid [\(Barett/Maxwell, p. 112](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=jgGTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=The+implications+for+food+aid+of+a+right-based+approach+are+manifold&source=bl&ots=eW2MjOxvHi&sig=U9JMrjV18VE_-XIf5gFj-Vv26po&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiov7C3iODVAhUSO7wKHUoGDhoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.7.3.2.3.1. Pro: Experts argue that decades of development aid have created a "[culture of dependency](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2017/04/20/making-africa-great-again-reducing-aid-dependency/)" and a "[dependency mindset](http://www.heritage.org/global-politics/commentary/foreign-aid-breaking-the-cycle-dependency)" in developing regions like Africa.
1.7.3.2.3.2. Con: If such aid was not provided, there would not be a livelihood at all for many of these people, much less a sustainable one. This is a far worse outcome than creating a dependency.
1.7.3.2.3.2.1. Con: [Large chunks of ODA](https://public.tableau.com/views/AidAtAGlance/DACmembers?:embed=y&:display_count=no?&:showVizHome=no#1) go into fields such as education and health and the creation of social and economic infrastructure. Humanitarian aid that is meant to help those in dire need makes up only about 12% of ODA payments. Thus, the number of livelihoods directly dependent on ODA is most likely relatively small.
1.7.3.3. Con: Democratic governments have a responsibility that the funds and resources provided by their own taxpayers are used in a lawful, ethical and unwasteful way.
1.7.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.
1.7.3.4. Con: If wealthy countries have an obligation to anyone, it is to the citizens of poor countries \(not the countries as such\). This makes it important for them to ensure that the assistance they give is used in these peoples' interest, which requires democratic governance.
1.7.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.6.
1.7.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.1.2.4.
1.7.4. Con: Willingly supporting illegitimate and exploitative regimes can be regarded as a stronger moral offense.
1.7.4.1. Con: Our own "democratic" governments are in their own way also illegitimate and exploitative, just less so. Therefore it can't be a reason to not give aid, nor can it be shown to be immoral, when compared to our own morals. For example, trade agreements, by Western countries exploit lesser diplomatically capable countries by protecting multinationals against the government of the country in which they operate.
1.7.4.2. Con: Not the regimes are the intended recipients for the donations but the people in need. Therefore, the support cannot be considered as 'willingly'.
1.7.4.3. Pro: Official support of a regime indicates acceptance or even approval: the donors become co-perpetrators.
1.7.4.3.1. Pro: Giving dictatorial regimes the means to exploit their citizens makes the donors complicit in the resulting oppression.
1.7.4.3.1.1. Pro: The European Development Fund is seen to be complicit in [Eritrea's detainment of journalists](https://rsf.org/en/news/eu-plans-provide-eritreas-oppressive-regime-new-funding) and political dissenters, because despite the government's lackluster efforts in democratization, aid contracts were renewed by the EDF.
1.7.4.4. Pro: Providing unconditional aid can be regarded as egoistic: it eases the donors' conscience at an easy price.
1.7.4.4.1. Con: It does not matter whether there are egoistic or altruistic reasons which cause democracies provide aid. What matters is that those in need are helped.
1.7.4.4.2. Pro: By providing unconditional aid, donors do not have to confront political actors and regimes and therefore do not have to face negative consequences.
1.7.4.5. Con: The governments of donor countries may have come to power through a democratic process, yet it is questionable whether they should consider themselves as superior to each and every non-democratic government in terms of actual legitimacy.
1.7.4.5.1. Pro: In the United States, less than 20% of voters approve of the work Congress does, half believe that most of its members are corrupt, 70% that they serve special interests and 80% that they are out of touch with the public \([Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx)\).
1.7.4.5.2. Pro: In Germany, half of all voters believe that politicians are out of touch, three out of four have little or no trust in political parties, and 40% are not satisfied with how democracy works in Germany \([infratest dimap, p. 12-14](http://www.infratest-dimap.de/fileadmin/user_upload/dt1610_bericht.pdf)\).
1.7.4.5.3. Pro: As of 2010, [more](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2453/Satisfaction-with-the-way-Parliament-works-19952010.aspx) British voters were dissatisfied than were satisfied with how their parliament works; and as of 2009, [83%](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2443/MPs-Motives-19942009.aspx) of them believed that their representative served first their own interests or those of their party, rather than those of their constituents or the country as a whole.
1.7.4.5.4. Con: It is not the political system of the non-democratic government that makes it immoral for the democratic state to support it per se, but rather the human rights abuses that always accompany a non-democratic rule.
1.7.4.5.4.1. Con: Just because a regime is not democratically legitimized does not mean that it is illegitimate and exploitative.
1.7.4.5.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.6.8.4.
1.7.4.5.4.1.2. Pro: For countries like China, the term "[performance legitimacy](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002764209338800)" is used to describe the implicit deal of government and people: as long as the former delivers economic growth and rising living standards, the latter play along without demands for fundamental political reform.
1.7.4.5.4.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.5.3.1.
1.7.4.5.4.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.6.4.2.2.4.
1.7.4.5.4.1.2.3. Con: The Chinese government has [rejected](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/china-and-tibet) the universality of human rights, and restricts the rights of its people - human rights lawyers have been assaulted, members of NGOs have been arrested on bogus charges, women are arrested while protesting against sexual harassment, and many are prevented from practising their religion. Economic indicators are not the only way to measure a regimes 'performance'.
1.7.4.5.4.2. Pro: Democracies uniquely provide civil liberties and rights as well as rule of law.
1.7.4.5.4.3. Con: The violation of rights in one area can go hand-in-hand with the promotion of rights in other areas. Numerous countries have helped millions of their citizens out of poverty and into a better life regardless \(and maybe with the help\) of authoritarian governance.
1.7.4.5.5. Pro: Countries where the public overwhelmingly supports the political conditionality of development aid should, first and foremost, look at their own flaws: research indicates that this support correlates with citizens' mistrust of their own government and the perception of corruption at home \([Bodenstein/Faust, p. 16f.](https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/32343b92-d3a9-49f5-880b-178055adba42.pdf)\).
1.7.4.5.5.1. Con: No democracy is completely flawless. However, this is no reason to omit conditionality on aid in order to spread democratic ideals, which empower people in developing countries.
1.7.4.5.6. Con: Legitimacy is not about a temporary public opinion, but about the way an individual or a group of individuals come into power: elected elites are morally superior to those who reached rule by succession or usurpation, as their authority is based upon the society members' approval.
1.7.4.5.6.1. Pro: Dictators are dictators exactly because they fear they will not be able to win elections. If they could, they have no reason to maintain an authoritarian regime.
1.7.4.5.6.2. Con: Legitimacy can have many sources that render a leader or a government acceptable to the people.
1.7.4.5.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.5.4.1.2.
1.7.4.5.6.2.2. Pro: Social scientists like Max Weber [argued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Types_of_Legitimate_Rule) already a century ago that legitimacy can not only be based on legal principles and rules but also tradition \(such as in Monarchies\) and charisma \(usually with a leader figure\).
1.7.4.5.6.2.2.1. Con: States based on traditional authority, such as monarchies, are inherently unequal, as the ruler is always above everyone else. Therefore, this form of legitimacy is morally inferior to a system which is based on freedom, equality and choice.
1.7.4.5.6.2.2.2. Con: Claiming that something is right because it "[has always existed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Types_of_Legitimate_Rule)" is a very weak argument.
1.7.4.5.7. Con: It is absurd to imply that dictators such as [Kim Jong Un](https://www.hrw.org/asia/north-korea), [Robert Mugabe](https://www.hrw.org/africa/zimbabwe), [Abdel Fattah al-Sisi](https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/egypt), [Bashar al-Asaad](https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/syria), and many other [brutal dictators](https://planetrulers.com/current-dictators/) around the world have more legitimacy than democratically elected leaders in the developed world.
1.7.4.5.7.1. Con: The world's worst dictators are not representative for all authoritarian governments. Some, for example in Singapore, China and Taiwan as well as South Korea until the 1980s did, arguably, a good job at acting in the interests of their peoples.
1.7.4.6. Con: -> See 1.7.4.5.4.1.
1.7.5. Pro: Making aid conditional violates the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule) \(ethics of reciprocity\): every individual would want to receive help in a situation of need, so it is unethical to deny it. This includes development assistance.
1.7.5.1. Con: This policy simply redirects aid from citizens of non-democratic states to citizens of democratic states, who also presumably need the aid. Given there is a finite amount of aid, redirecting it to other states does not violate the Golden Rule.
1.7.5.2. Pro: Versions of the Golden Rule can be found in a huge number of [religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule#Religious_context) all over the world. This underlines its importance in human culture and community as well as its universality.
1.7.5.2.1. Con: States should not base their foreign aid policy on religious precepts, but rather on which policy best improves the lives of people in recipient states.
1.7.5.3. Con: The Golden Rule is not an economic or political guide, but a moral rule for individual behavior.
1.7.5.3.1. Con: Individual behavior is as well a product of decisions based on situations, personal experiences, future expectations, etc. as economical and political decisions. Even more, economical and political decisions rely very much on individual behavior, thus the Golden Rule, if a factor for individual behavior, must be valid as well for economical and political decisions, because they are made by individuals.
1.7.5.3.2. Pro: The appropriate measuring stick for governments and political representatives is not individual morality, but what is best for their country and the people they represent as a whole.
1.7.5.4. Con: If making aid conditional on democratization results in non-democratic regimes democratizing and carrying out economic reform, conditional aid best fulfills the Golden Rule.
1.7.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.7.5.4.2. Con: People living in absolute poverty, arguably, care more about aid that improves their immediate conditions than policies that push their country toward democracy in the long-run.
1.7.5.4.2.1. Con: Creating a sustainable economy that will improve the lives of all future generations is a greater moral imperative than assisting just the current generation in an unsustainable, and often inefficient, manner.
1.7.5.4.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.
1.7.5.5. Pro: Like every individual would want to receive help in a situation of need, collectives of individuals would want to receive help as well: states should treat other states as they would want to be treated by them.
1.7.6. Pro: Conditional aid works as an excuse to stop providing support for those in need.
1.7.6.1. Pro: The [Trump administration](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/04/24/u-s-agency-for-international-development-foreign-aid-state-department-trump-slash-foreign-funding/) already plans to reduce aid under the premise: 'we intend to make the best use of U.S. taxpayer dollars by eliminating programs and prioritizing resources that most advance America’s interests'. Conditions would make it even easier to justify the further elimination of programs.
1.7.6.1.1. Con: The fact that the primary reason stated by the Trump administration is to put the American taxpayer before other countries indicates that the American government does not need to use aid conditionality as an excuse.
1.7.6.2. Con: Making aid conditional will simply redirect foreign aid funds from corrupt states to non-corrupt states. This is a perfectly reasonable move for donor states to take, and there is no reason why they would need an excuse.
1.7.6.3. Con: Donor states [cut](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/nov/16/uk-suspends-aid-uganda-misuse) [aid](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/congress-cuts-us-military-and-development-aid-for-afghanistan/2014/01/24/3d4cb818-8531-11e3-bbe5-6a2a3141e3a9_story.html?utm_term=.32d77dc0e57b) all the time. Either the finances of the donor state no longer allow aid to be sent, or the aid sent is abused by the recipient states. Donor states simply do not, and do not need to, make an excuse to cut aid.
1.7.6.4. Con: Even though the political conditionality of aid has been talked about and partially been implemented for decades, the total amount of ODA has been [steadily increasing](https://www.oecd.org/dac/development-aid-rises-again-in-2016-but-flows-to-poorest-countries-dip.htm) over the past 15 years. If political conditionality were a ploy to reduce aid spending, the data should reflect this.
1.7.6.5. Pro: Children and other vulnerable groups need support regardless of wars and politics.
1.7.7. Con: -> See 1.7.3.3.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.
