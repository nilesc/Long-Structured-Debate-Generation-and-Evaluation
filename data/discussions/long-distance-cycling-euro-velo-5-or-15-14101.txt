Discussion Title: Long Distance Cycling: Euro Velo 5 or 15?

1. [Euro Velo 5](http://www.viaromeafrancigena.com//UK_front-page?set_language=en) is better than [15](http://www.rhinecycleroute.eu/?set_language=en)
1.1. Con: 15 is along the Rhine
1.1.1. Con: Only river might be boring eventually.
1.2. Con: The main difference in cities on the way is : Brussels, Namur, Luxembourg, Saarbrücken on the Euro Velo 5 vs Rotterdam, Nijmegen, Xanten, The Rhur Area, Cologne, Koblent, Mainz, Mannheim \(and if we fancy Heidelberg\), Speyer and Karlsruhe.
1.3. Con: Many more people ride 15 than 5
1.4. Con: There are more wineyards on the Rhine than elsewhere.
1.5. Pro: More countries
1.5.1. Con: We see Straßbourg on both tours.
1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.5.3. Con: More countries mean more potential border controls
1.6. Con: One spends more time in the Netherlands.
1.7. Con: There are probably more campsites which means more flexibility.
1.8. Pro: Belgium offers a richer variety of breweries.
1.8.1. Pro: Belgium is also the home of frieten, Jenever, and many other delicacies.
1.9. Con: Euro 15 has a higher density of worth-to-visit cities.
1.9.1. Pro: Historically The Rhine was one of the main economic lifelines of Europe and as a consequence saw many cities flourish.

1.11.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
