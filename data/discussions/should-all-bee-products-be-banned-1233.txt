Discussion Title: Should All Bee Products Be Banned?

1. Honey and other products that come from bees should be forbidden even if it comes from organic bees with responsible beekeeping.
1.1. Pro: Instead of eating honey - which is by far the most consumed bee product - there are many alternative non-animal products with the same sweetening effect.
1.1.1. Con: Those products however lack the [wound healing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey#Medical_uses) properties of honey.
1.1.1.1. Pro: [Honey](http://realfoodforlife.com/health-benefits-of-honey/) works antiseptic and has anti-bacterial as well as anti-fungal qualities.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Honey can be used to [disinfect](http://www.well-beingsecrets.com/health-benefits-of-honey-ultimate-guide/) burns and scratches and stimulate the healing process.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Manuka honey](http://draxe.com/manuka-honey-benefits-uses/) is said to be antibacterial.
1.1.1.2. Con: Today there is medication for that and we do no longer need honey for wound healing.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: However, some people are hypersensitive to many pharmaceuticals, so natural antiseptic remedies, such as honey, can provide them with alternatives.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: Isolated peoples such as the Bedouins have little to no access to modern medicine.
1.1.1.3. Con: Very few of us are in need of constant wound-healing in today's societies.
1.1.2. Pro: Dried fruit or fruit concentrates can replace honey in recipes.
1.1.3. Con: There are alternatives to every kind of food, thus there being an alternative to honey is not a good argument, as the same could be said for sweeteners, sugar, syrups, etc...
1.1.3.1. Con: It's a good argument for not eating disgusting or dangerous/potentially sickening food etc. But honey does not belong to that category.
1.1.4. Pro: Same with [mead \(a.k.a. honey wine\)](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-Mead-Honey-Wine/), as there are other wines that people can buy.
1.1.5. Con: Most of the mentioned alternatives to honey require exploiting plants and steal their fruits or other parts.
1.1.6. Pro: Cane sugar is a popular sweetener.
1.1.6.1. Con: Cane sugar is linked with heart disease, high cholesterol and other health issues, while [honey promotes](https://draxe.com/the-many-health-benefits-of-raw-honey/) a stronger immune system and resistance to allergens.
1.1.7. Pro: Plant syrups such as rice syrup or maple syrup taste great.
1.1.7.1. Pro: [Date syrup is popular in Israel](https://en.yoffi.gift/products/pure-silan).
1.1.8. Pro: Artificial sweeteners are a great low-calory alternative.
1.1.8.1. Con: But artificial sweetners tend to [alter](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/29/artificial-sweetener-tast_n_6061348.html) the taste of food.
1.1.8.2. Con: Artificial sweeteners are just like it says in the title: "artificial", not natural, therefore disharmonious to the body.
1.2. Pro: The consumption of honey and other bee products is unethical.
1.2.1. Pro: Taking away the bees' self-made food, which they obtained in a process of hard work, equals theft.
1.2.1.1. Con: Bees are no subjects to human law, so taking their honey is not "stealing".
1.2.1.1.1. Con: When one animal steals something from another animal we still call it theft, though legally it might not be, morally it is. And this is theft.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The bees did not agree to trading in the honey for sugar water and protection.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Evolution created humans as the undisputed alpha predators and most dominant species on earth. It is their natural right to take what they want to.
1.2.1.2. Pro: A single worker bee may visit up to 10,000 flowers in one day and, in her lifetime, produce only a [teaspoonful](http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/animals-used-food-factsheets/honey-factory-farmed-bees/) of honey. Honey is the hard-earned fruit of their labor and belongs to them.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Bees are not human, and therefore do not experience life the way humans do.  They do not conceptualize flying from flower to flower as work, in the way humans experience it. Likewise they don't conceptualize ownership of honey in the way humans do.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: That is why a beehive contains up to around 60000 bees.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: This only proves the quantification of the hard work.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Stealing / theft is wrong.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Stealing violates one of the Ten Commandments.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Stealing is the illegal act of taking something without permission.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: Bees are not sentient, and therefore establishing permissions is impossible.
1.2.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.1.4. Con: Using the same argument every kind of labour is morally wrong.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: Usually in \(legal\) labour the workers are compensated for their performances through salaries and other benefits.
1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: This excludes the most common form of labour: illegal labour
1.2.1.4.1.1.1. Con: That is why it is called illegal labour. It should not only be, but it is forbidden.
1.2.1.4.1.2. Con: The bees are compensated: The removed honey is replaced with a sugar based fluid. Also their hive is kept safe and intact by the apiarist.
1.2.1.4.1.2.1. Con: The sugar based fluid is not a comparably sufficient energy source for the bees, as it is [not fortifying](http://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/whats-wrong-with-eating-honey/). Honey instead provides vital nourishment for them.
1.2.1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: The provided source also states that this may or may not happen depending on the beekeeper. So this argument is less about whether bee products are immoral, but how process is conducted.
1.2.1.5. Pro: Honey bees store their honey as a primary food source in wax honeycombs inside the beehive. In cold weather or when other food sources are scarce, adult and larval bees use stored honey as food. They need honey as a primary food source for themselves.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: Bees should be able to support themselves without humans taking their food, whether it is done in a considerate way or not, it is in some form stealing.
1.2.1.5.2. Con: Farmers take measures to ensure the health of their hives.
1.2.1.6. Con: Bees colonies the size farmers keep produce [more honey than the bees can consume](http://www.beeculture.com/timing-honey-harvet/), and removing the excess amount should not be considered unethical.
1.2.1.6.1. Con: Since many places are concerned about their bee population, leaving the bees all of the food they create could help them increase in number.
1.2.1.7. Con: It's important to consider this: Bees aren't conscious of themselves. Them, as well as other insects are natures equivalent to robots. They're hive minded and they're purpose is to pollinate. Their honey is a way for them to keep pollinating.
1.2.1.7.1. Con: Why would they bite when they feel threat to their hive ? They are aware of somebody taking their honey and they try to punish accordingly. They don't fly and bite everybody without a reason. Knowing that reason is equivalent of consciousness.
1.2.1.8. Con: Theft, killing and eating is part of normal nature functioning. All animals, including people, can't survive if they don't steal, kill and eat. Stealing or fighting for a limited resource \(food, territory, females\) happens all the time between animals and between people.
1.2.2. Con: As long as the bees are not physically harmed \(as may be the case with consuming meat or dairy products\) there is no ethical issue when consuming honey, propolis, royal jelly or beeswax.
1.2.2.1. Con: Just like factory farmers, many beekeepers take inhumane steps to ensure personal safety and reach production quotas.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: When the keeper wants to move a queen to a new colony, she is carried with “bodyguard” bees, all of whom - if they survive transport - [will be killed](http://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/whats-wrong-with-eating-honey/) by bees in the new colony.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: In colder areas, if the keepers consider it too costly to keep the bees alive through the winter, they destroy the hives using [cyanide gas](http://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/whats-wrong-with-eating-honey/).
1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: I've only seen the claim that cyanide gas is used by beekeepers on the PETA site. The practise of killing a bee colony, rather than over wintering it, doesn't make any practical or commercial sense. Even in the worst-case the cost of feeding a few Kg of sugar would be a fraction of the cost of replacing the bees.
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: It is not unusual for larger honey producers to [cut off](http://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/whats-wrong-with-eating-honey/) the queen bee’s wings so that she cannot leave the colony or to have her [artificially inseminated](http://www.besamungsgeraet.de/__en/the-insemination-process/) on a bee-sized version of the factory farm “[rape rack](http://www.besamungsgeraet.de/__en/)”.
1.2.2.1.3.1. Con: Calling it a "rape rack" gives it a negative connotation more suited for modern media/propaganda than for factual debating. It's an artificial insemination tool for beekeepers; change your terminology or perhaps go back to arguing on Facebook.
1.2.2.1.4. Pro: Bees are often killed or have their wings and legs torn off by [haphazard handling](http://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/whats-wrong-with-eating-honey/).
1.2.2.1.4.1. Pro: [This study](http://www.vegetus.org/honey/pain.htm) shows that bees have a painkilling system which can be manipulated with morphine and naloxone. The existence of such a system suggests that bees feel pain.
1.2.2.1.4.1.1. Con: The fact that bees feel pain, while interesting, does not mean that we intentionally cause them pain, or that it is morally wrong to harvest their products.
1.2.2.1.4.2. Con: Bees have no consciousness, they are just like robots. Ripping of the limbs of a non-self-realized robot is not increasing anyone's suffering.
1.2.2.1.4.2.1. Con: Studies show that while they may be small, bees are [more intelligent](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3546189/Why-bees-cleverer-think-Insects-conscious-world-use-buzz-control-pollen.html) than we have given them credit for. Far from being pollen gathering machines, bees just like humans are controlled by their own desires.
1.2.2.1.4.2.2. Con: Bees are highly adaptive and [sophisticated creatures](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exploring-consciousness/) with a bit fewer than one million neurons, which are interconnected in ways that are beyond our current understanding, jammed into less than one cubic millimeter of brain tissue.
1.2.2.1.5. Pro: Since the division of the hive upon the birth of a new queen can cause a decline in honey production, beekeepers do what they can to [prevent swarming](http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/animals-used-food-factsheets/honey-factory-farmed-bees/).
1.2.2.1.5.1. Con: What the PETA article conveniently fails to mention is the potential loss of bee life during a [swarm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarming_\(honey_bee\)). So the question becomes which is more inhumane: confining the queen to the hive to prevent swarming, or allowing the hive to swarm and lose an unforeseen amount of bees? Since up to 60% of the colony could leave in the swarm \(this includes said queen\) and up to all of them could die, \(depending on the region and available hive locations\) It seems more humane to prevent swarming of domestic bees.
1.2.2.1.5.2. Pro: Clipping the wings of a new queen is a common method.
1.2.2.1.5.3. Pro: Killing and replacing an older queen after just one or two years is an often practiced method.
1.2.2.1.5.4. Pro: Confining a queen who is trying to begin a swarm is a method.
1.2.2.1.6. Con: If many beekeepers take inhumane steps in order to produce products this implies that some do not.
1.2.2.1.7. Con: In organic bee farming or urban bee keeping bees are managed naturally and humanely. This even benefits the bees.
1.2.2.1.7.1. Pro: Organic beekeeping manages bees in a way that promotes [optimum health](http://www.buzzaboutbees.net/organic-beekeeping.html), whilst minimising / avoiding use of conventional veterinary products for controlling diseases, mites, and by using natural, organic methods for dealing with problems in the bee hive and honey bee colony.
1.2.2.1.7.1.1. Pro: In organic beekeeping bees are allowed to consume their own honey – that is, organic beekeepers do not remove all the honey from the bee hives – [sufficient honey](http://www.buzzaboutbees.net/organic-beekeeping.html) must be left for the bees themselves to feed upon during the winter months.
1.2.2.1.7.2. Pro: Studies have shown that urban bee populations are tougher than their rurally based counterparts. The primary reason for this is diet. Each species of pollen provides a different assortment of nutrients and [health benefits](https://ixquick-proxy.com/do/spg/proxy2?ep=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&epile=4q6n41784r6n41314q6n51784s5638304p6q746p65513q3q&edata=1a03b7bb6a999d4a099499babf1ec37f&ek=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&ekdata=f19a3ed6064b46c74952db10927ee91b) for bees. Since pollen diversity is much higher in cities than it is out in the sticks, bees that pollinate in the former tend to be much healthier than those who reside in the latter.
1.2.2.1.7.3. Pro: The reduced use of pesticides, as well as more sustainable management practices makes organic farms important partners in pollinator conservation efforts. \([organicconsumers.org](https://www.organicconsumers.org/sites/default/files/organic_farming_for_bees.pdf)\)
1.2.2.1.7.3.1. Con: Even pesticides approved for organic agriculture can cause significant [harm](https://www.organicconsumers.org/sites/default/files/organic_farming_for_bees.pdf) to bees.
1.2.3. Con: Humans cannot take care of every little creature. Next thing we know we would need to show respect for the bacteria living in our guts, because we hold them as slaves.
1.2.3.1. Con: Taking care of the bacterial cultures in your gut is an extremely good idea.
1.2.3.2. Con: There is a difference in unconsciously / unintentionally hurting creatures and intentionally exploiting them.
1.2.3.3. Con: It is not about taking care of every little creature, but rather not intentionally hurting it.
1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.2.5. Con: For bee product production to be immoral, there would have to be an immoral act, but there is not, as bees, like all insects or plants, have no consciousness and are not considered part of the space that is touched upon by human moral judgement.
1.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.4.1.
1.2.5.2. Con: Insects possess small brains, but they exhibit sophisticated behavioral performances. Various insects species have unsuspected [cognitive capabilities](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.1348/epdf?r3_referer=wol&tracking_action=preview_click&show_checkout=1&purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED_NO_CUSTOMER).
1.2.5.2.1. Con: While the article states that bees have surprisingly complex nervous systems and thought processes, it seems to only be in relation to memory and learning behaviors, not the presence of a moral code or behavior based on ethics. As the link only shows a preview of the entire article, one cannot assume it covers the morality of insects.
1.2.6. Con: Compared to most food production, bee farming seems to be one of least harmful towards the environments.
1.2.7. Con: Compared to other kinds of production, no animals are intentionally hurt, killed or eaten.
1.2.7.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.2.8. Con: Bee's lives do not matter.
1.2.8.1. Con: I would argue that bee's lives, in the grand scheme of the planet, matter more than human's lives, since all bees provide the means for a great amount of plants to reproduce, supplying oxygen for land-based lifeforms, thereby perpetuating a life-cycle whereas the majority of humans consume but do not replenish, thereby doing the exact opposite.
1.2.9. Con: Bees are extremely important for agriculture generally, and commercial bee-keeping provides a well-protected and closely observed population. This probably would allow earlier detection of, eg., a disease that wipes out colonies.
1.2.10. Con: A properly maintained apiary provides a safe, guarded home for the bees.
1.2.11. Pro: Vegan propagandists spread misinformation that all produce is vegan when it is not, creating unethical situations where people buy produce \(that used bees to make\) thinking that animals were not exploited in the production process.
1.2.11.1. Pro: [PETA's vegan recipes](https://www.peta.org/recipes/) include food that [utilize bees in the production process](http://pollinator.org/list-of-pollinated-food).
1.3. Pro: Bees are of great importance and thus should not be exploited.
1.3.1. Con: Bees equally benefit from beekeeping and the sales of honey.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Those who make honey need a profit incentive to keep the hives. If you take that away by banning the selling of honey they will have no use for their hives and most will get rid of them. You would, therefore, end up speeding up the extinction of bees by taking away many people's livelihoods.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Beekeepers work to keep the bees healthy. For example, they treat the hives against the Varroa mite which is ubiquitous in many regions and which the western honeybee has little defence against.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Without the protection and maintenance of beekeepers, the number of bee colonies would surely decline. Honey bees rely on human interaction to survive.
1.3.1.4. Pro: Bee products should be promoted to increase the care and awareness of how important bees are, through bee-friendly solutions \(like hobbyist beehives\).
1.3.1.5. Pro: Beekeeping and the ability of honey \(and related products\) are both ways for non-experts to learn about the complex threats facing honeybees \(e.g. neonicotinoids and monoculture\) without the need for a formal education in entomology/ecology/biological sciences.
1.3.1.6. Con: Moving bees is a well-known distress factor to honeybees \([www.hindawi.com](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/psyche/2012/193029/\)) and the monofloral \(one plant only\) diet is considered to be related to declining overall bee health \([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2936196/\).)
1.3.1.7. Pro: Beekeeping is synonymous with bee protection, it promotes further pollination of local plants. Beekeepers are well aware of the importance of bees.
1.3.1.7.1. Pro: The beekeeper protects the bee and helps it with housing and treatment for illness.
1.3.1.7.2. Con: Protecting non-native bees \(especially the introduced species mentioned in the PETA link that provide most economic and societal benefits\) does not make sense, as they do not belong to their non-native lands anyway.
1.3.1.7.2.1. Pro: Protecting one species over another \(especially a non-native vs native species\) forms a bias, which causes certain endangered species to be saved over others.
1.3.1.7.2.1.1. Pro: Efforts should be focused on protecting native endangered species more than honeybees.
1.3.1.7.2.2. Pro: Commercial bees can create negative impacts and should not be protected.
1.3.1.7.2.2.1. Pro: Commercial bees \(such as [bumblebees](https://beependent.wordpress.com/invasive-species/)\) spread diseases to and create competition for native, wild bee populations.
1.3.1.7.2.2.2. Pro: Hybrid bees are [an invasive species](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1958657_1958656_1958665,00.html). Not only bad for wildlife, the invasiveness is also bad for people.
1.3.1.8. Pro: Bees are friends with humans and should be cared for as friends, provided with homes and interfered with as little as possible. We need to stop and think and be kind.
1.3.2. Pro: Bees are [responsible](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/why-bees-are-important-to-our-planet/) for the pollination of many kinds of plants. Bees focus to a certain species of plants at a time and visit it more frequently, thus the vital pollens stay pure, the quality of their pollination is better than done by other insects or the wind.
1.3.2.1. Con: All of these arguments make it sound like using bee products kills bees, while the beekeeping required for it actually increases the bee population, thereby doing all these things at a greater rate than if bee products were banned and beekeeping were illegal. These arguments hurt the thesis rather than help it.
1.3.2.2. Pro: [Bees](http://broccoli, asparagus, cantaloupes, cucumbers, pumpkins, blueberries, watermelons, almonds, apples, cranberries, and cherries.) make earth more beauty- and colorful as they are an important factor for flowers' reproduction.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Around 84% of crops consumed and processed by humans, more than 400 different species of plants, are [pollinated](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/17/why-are-bees-important) by bees.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Broccoli, asparagus, cantaloupes, cucumbers, pumpkins, blueberries, watermelons, almonds, apples, cranberries, and cherries - all this sources of food are [pollinated](http://broccoli, asparagus, cantaloupes, cucumbers, pumpkins, blueberries, watermelons, almonds, apples, cranberries, and cherries.) by bees and would vanish without their work.
1.3.2.4. Pro: Bees not only are important for plants used and needed by humans, but also by animals around the globe. So bees can be described as the [guardians](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/17/why-are-bees-important) of earth's ecosystem and biodiversity.
1.4. Con: Honey and other bee products come with many benefits for humans.
1.4.1. Pro: Honey comes with great health benefits for humans.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Honey cures [dandruff](http://www.well-beingsecrets.com/health-benefits-of-honey-ultimate-guide/).
1.4.1.2. Pro: Honey can fight symptoms of [herpes](http://www.well-beingsecrets.com/health-benefits-of-honey-ultimate-guide/).
1.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.4.1.4. Pro: [Honey's](http://realfoodforlife.com/health-benefits-of-honey/) exact combination of fructose glucose helps the regulate the blood sugar level.
1.4.1.5. Pro: The flavonoids and antioxidants contained in [honey](http://realfoodforlife.com/health-benefits-of-honey/) lower the risk of some kind of cancers as well as heart diseases.
1.4.1.6. Pro: Honey helps to [reduce](http://realfoodforlife.com/health-benefits-of-honey/) ulcers and other gastrointestinal disorders.
1.4.1.7. Pro: Honey helps to [reduce](http://realfoodforlife.com/health-benefits-of-honey/) cough and throat irritations.
1.4.1.8. Pro: Honey is a [memory booster](http://www.well-beingsecrets.com/health-benefits-of-honey-ultimate-guide/).
1.4.1.9. Con: This is only one side of the coin as there are serious health risks connected with the consumption of honey.
1.4.1.9.1. Pro: Bee honey can be [polluted](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240954817_Bee_honey_as_environmental_indicator_for_pollution_with_heavy_metals) and thus may negatively impact on humans' health.
1.4.1.9.2. Pro: Honey collected in the [countryside](http://www.eea.europa.eu/atlas/eea/city-bees/story/article) carries with it pollutants used in agriculture.
1.4.1.9.2.1. Con: Honey collected in [cities](http://www.eea.europa.eu/atlas/eea/city-bees/story/article) is much cleaner. Eating only this honey carries less risk of pollutants.
1.4.1.9.3. Pro: Bees might collect polm from toxic plants making the resulting honey unsafe for human consumption, such as in the case of [tutin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutin_\(toxin\)) contamination.
1.4.1.9.3.1. Con: Even the source says that this is a rare event, and I would imagine could become even more rare with proper beekeeping. The benefits of honey far outweigh the slight chance of this happening.
1.4.1.9.4. Pro: Honey's healthy image is [misleading](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2808799/Healthy-No-honey-WORSE-sugar.html) as it is as unhealthy as sugar.
1.4.1.9.4.1. Pro: Despite the chemical difference to sugar, our bodies react to honey in much same way as to refined sugar - with a [blood-sugar spike](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2808799/Healthy-No-honey-WORSE-sugar.html). This encourages the pancreas to produce insulin, which leads the body to store fat and gain weight.
1.4.1.9.5. Pro: The [clostridium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16689729) concentration in some honeys can cause [infant botulism](http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/aa142).
1.4.1.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.9.4.1.
1.4.1.9.7. Pro: Products containing [fructose](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2808799/Healthy-No-honey-WORSE-sugar.html) \(honey is about 55% fructose\) contribute to obesity, heart problems and liver disease, just like products with granulated sugar. Plus, fructose drains minerals from your body.
1.4.1.9.7.1. Con: This is a contentious claim. Scholarly studies [link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11130-004-0049-7) suggest the exact opposite.
1.4.1.9.8. Pro: Glucose, fructose and carbs in honey can cause [collagen damage](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2808799/Healthy-No-honey-WORSE-sugar.html).
1.4.1.9.9. Pro: Honey is high in [calories](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2808799/Healthy-No-honey-WORSE-sugar.html) - more than table sugar. A teaspoon of commercial natural honey contains about 22 calories, a teaspoon of sugar around 16 calories.
1.4.1.9.9.1. Con: Which is why you don't use as much honey as you would sugar. Since honey tastes sweeter than sugar as well, [you can achieve the same amount of sweetness using less](http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/food-myths-debunked-honey-is-better-than-white-sugar-because-it-is-natural.html), thereby equaling or reducing the amount of total calories.
1.4.1.9.10. Con: Many things that are unhealthy are allowed, something being unhealthy does not necessitate forbidding its consumption.
1.4.1.9.10.1. Pro: Alcohol is harmful and still allowed.
1.4.1.9.10.2. Pro: Smoking is harmful and still allowed.
1.4.1.9.10.2.1. Con: Smoking is not generally allowed. There are age restrictions as well as certain public places where it is [prohibited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_ban).
1.4.1.9.10.3. Con: Hard drugs are illegal, because they are unhealthy.
1.4.1.9.10.4. Pro: Sugar is unhealthy and legal.
1.4.1.9.10.4.1. Pro: Sugar can [damage](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kristin-kirkpatrick-ms-rd-ld/dangers-of-sugar_b_3658061.html) the heart.
1.4.1.9.10.4.2. Pro: Sugar may be linked to [cancer](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kristin-kirkpatrick-ms-rd-ld/dangers-of-sugar_b_3658061.html) production.
1.4.1.9.10.4.3. Pro: Sugar and alcohol have similar [toxic liver effects](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kristin-kirkpatrick-ms-rd-ld/dangers-of-sugar_b_3658061.html) on the body.
1.4.1.9.10.4.3.1. Pro: Indeed. We \(typically\) moderate our drinking but not our sugar intake. You wouldn't pour your children several shots of vodka every day would you? Yet we cram them full of sugar with little thought.
1.4.1.9.10.4.4. Pro: An overconsumption of sugar [shortens the lifetime](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kristin-kirkpatrick-ms-rd-ld/dangers-of-sugar_b_3658061.html) of humans.
1.4.1.9.10.4.5. Pro: Sugar consumption is responsible for [adiposity](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kristin-kirkpatrick-ms-rd-ld/dangers-of-sugar_b_3658061.html) with all its negative effects.
1.4.1.9.10.4.5.1. Pro: Some [scientists](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/healthyeating/9987825/Sweet-poison-why-sugar-is-ruining-our-health.html) believe that fructose fools our brains into thinking we are not full, so we overeat.
1.4.1.9.10.4.6. Pro: Sugar is highly [addictive](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/healthyeating/9987825/Sweet-poison-why-sugar-is-ruining-our-health.html).
1.4.1.10. Pro: Bee products like honey have lots of [medical uses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3611628/).
1.4.1.10.1. Pro: I.e. "[Burt's Bees](https://www.burtsbees.com/)" products.
1.4.2. Pro: Honey tastes fantastic.
1.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Honey is delicious and used in many prominent cultural dishes.
1.4.3. Pro: Beekeeping provides for major economic benefits.
1.4.3.1. Pro: In the [US](https://beeinformed.org/2016/05/10/nations-beekeepers-lost-44-percent-of-bees-in-2015-16/) the total economic value of honey bee pollination services range between $10 billion and $15 billion annually.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Beekeeping is a way to escape [poverty](http://www.apimondia.com/congresses/2013/Economy/Plenary-Session/Measuring%20Rural%20Beekeepers%20Benefits%20Goes%20Beyond%20Income,%20Inputs%20And%20Poverty%20Line%20-%20Stephen%20E.%20Msemo.pdf) in developing countries.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Honey collection \(apiculture\) is an important livelihood for many \(poor\) people.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: In [Bangladesh](http://munshigonj.info/2015/01/27/76932/) around 25.000 people are engaged in honey collecting.
1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: In the rural areas of Bangladesh, honey has a lot of [uses](http://In the rural areas, honey, a marvellous gift of nature, has a lot of uses. Those cover a wide area including herbal medication, a substitute for goorh \(molasses\) in making ceremonial delicacies and a welcome sweetener for newborns). Herbal medication, a substitute for goorh \(molasses\) in making ceremonial delicacies and a sweetener for newborns.
1.4.3.2.1.2. Pro: The tribe of [Kattunayakan](https://newint.org/features/2009/09/01/tribal-peoples/) in India makes most of its living by collecting honey from wild bees in the forest ever since. They are highly dependent on it.
1.4.3.2.1.3. Pro: The [Moule](http://www.academia.edu/7274950/Moule_honey_collectors_of_Sundarbans_and_their_ITKs) folks of the Sundarbans are so depended on wild pure honey, they even risk their lives collecting it, as there are tigers in the forest.
1.4.3.3. Pro: The [30.000 tons](http://www.honeybee.com.au/Library/gibsmuir.html) of honey produced in Australia per year have a market value of over $4.5 million at a price of [$7.12](http://www.honey.com/honey-industry/honey-industry-statistics/unit-honey-prices-by-month-retail/) per pound.
1.4.4. Pro: Even if humans stopped using honey and beeswax, beekeeping would still be necessary to maintain production of crops like canola and flax at current levels as they rely on mobile beehives to artificially raise the number of pollinators. These crops are relied on by humans as a source of food and fabric, and as flexible and widely used crops, come with many benefits.
1.4.5. Con: Providing a benefit for humans does not equate to being ethical.
1.4.5.1. Con: The thesis does not specify why all bee products should be banned, just that they should, so the fact that they provide benefits for humans is a valid con to the thesis
1.5. Con: This would lead to a massive decline in available [produce](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/migratory-beekeeping-mind-boggling-math/) as bees are [routinely](http://www.npr.org/2017/03/09/519500033/bees-travel-cross-country-for-the-california-almond-harvest)[moved](http://caes2.caes.uga.edu/bees/pollination/managing-bees-pollination.html) from orchards and fields to pollinate food crops.
1.5.1. Pro: And selling off the excess honey allows the Beekeeper to control the size of his colony. Otherwise they would grow unchecked and unmanageable.
1.5.2. Con: Consuming [mechanical pollination \(machines or people\)](http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2015/2015/bee_tech.html) or [self-pollinating crops](http://www.hortmag.com/plants/fruits-veggies/vegetable-crops-that-do-not-need-pollinators) makes it possible to not rely on bees to eat and exist.
1.5.3. Pro: Pollination by bees is crucial and indispensable to agriculture. If bee products were banned, apiarists would simply dramatically increase the fees they charge to farmers for hive transport. The honey would have to be extracted anyway to get the bees out and pollinating and would go to waste if not sold. Bee-keeping would not change, only its revenue model.
1.5.4. Pro: If beekeeping was forbidden, there would be fewer beekeepers and thus also fewer bees. This would be detrimental to the environment.
1.5.4.1. Con: There were bees before there were beekeepers.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Bees can swarm and pollenize just fine without the intervention of any beekeepers.
1.5.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.7.
1.5.4.1.2. Con: The overall conditions changed, the natural living environment of bees declined. More urban areas, more agricultural monocultures etc..
1.5.4.2. Pro: In the US beekeepers lost [44%](https://beeinformed.org/2016/05/10/nations-beekeepers-lost-44-percent-of-bees-in-2015-16/) of bees in 2015-16 despite attempts to save them. Without those attempts the loss would have been higher.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: Unregulated beekeeping allows [mites](https://beeinformed.org/2016/05/10/nations-beekeepers-lost-44-percent-of-bees-in-2015-16/) to spread quickly and causes a loss in bees. More commercialy regulated beekeeping can contain this spread because they are better informed and have more resources to fight mites.
1.5.4.2.2. Pro: Without beekeeping there would be no organizations, such as [The Bee Informed Partnership](https://beeinformed.org/about/), that can research about the causes of bee decline.
1.5.4.3. Con: The massive dying of honey bees is a result of various factors such as [pesticides and monocropping](http://mjpa.umich.edu/files/2014/08/2014-BiancoCooperFournier-HoneyBee.pdf), thus having less beekeepers will not change that.
1.5.4.3.1. Con: "[Colony Collapse Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder)" \(CCD\) is suggested to have multiple possible reasons, none of which is monocropping.
1.5.4.4. Pro: Beekeeping is not a rewarding task by itself for most people, and thus most beekeepers require compensation of some kind to perform the task: that compensation must come from outside sources or the bees themselves.
1.5.4.5. Con: A lot of the beekeepers make a living from industrial pollination of crops and trees.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.
1.7. Pro: People should not consume pollinated crops \(even if bees flew randomly onto them unintentionally\).
1.7.1. Pro: Those bees might have come from farms that buy bees from bees farms with inhumane practices \(such as [using antibiotics](https://www.back40bees.com/about.html)\) and eating foods pollinated by them indirectly supports the inhumane bee farms.
1.7.1.1. Pro: [European bees can be hybridized with Killer bees on purpose for farming honey](https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/in790), and the random bees could come from there.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.7.2.2.2.
1.7.1.2. Pro: [Bred bees designed to pollinate farms get agitated during travel](https://www.buglogical.com/bumble-bees-natural-pollination/), which is harmful to those bees.
1.7.2. Con: If bees come from nature, then those bees benefit from pollinating the farm by feeding their hive.
1.7.2.1. Con: Even those bees are not ethical, as [bees in the wild are unnatural: they might be mixed/accidentally hybridized with bees that came from an inhumane farm if bees are accidentally released from those farms.](https://honeybeesuite.com/monday-morning-myth-africanized-honey-bees-are-apis-mellifera-scutellata/)
1.7.2.1.1. Con: An accidentally mixed or hybridized bee which has been growing up in the wild has not been subject to unethical treatment.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Con: No, but its ancestor could have been. Supporting the bee's descendant could somehow support inhumane treatment as the mixed/hybridized bee would not be alive without its parent.
1.7.3. Pro: Bees could be killed by machinery in the agricultural process.
1.7.3.1. Pro: An example is mechanically plowing the fields when bees are pollinating those crops.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Trucks transporting the finished product could hit bees along the road.
1.7.4. Pro: If the farm uses pesticides unintentionally because they did not expect bees, any bees flying over \(and [their hive](https://www.epa.gov/pollinator-protection/colony-collapse-disorder)\) could be [affected by them](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/neonicotinoid-pesticides-slowly-killing-bees).
1.7.5. Pro: There are alternatives to pollinated crops \(where bees are not part of the pollination process\), such as self- or wind-pollinated crops as well as crops pollinated without bees \(using machines or humans\)
1.7.5.1. Con: If bees are not allowed onto a farm to pollinate, then those bees could lose a potential food source \(the crops\).
1.7.6. Con: Bees and other insect pollinators are so prolific that in order not to eat a bee pollinated crop we would need to exterminate or starve bees in order to eat non-bee pollinated crops.
1.8. Con: Other factors affect bee populations as much as or more than bee products and should be resolved as part of the process of helping bees out.
1.8.1. Pro: People buy products that affect bees and should be modified to protect bees.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Land might be cleared in a bee-residing area for human use. To not devastate the bees there, land-use planners should avoid those areas to protect native populations.
1.8.1.1.1. Pro: Examples of reasons for clearing land are to make way for cities and agriculture.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Some [bug sprays target bees to kill them](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/noble-chemical-bee-gone-wasp-hornet-spray-aerosol-12-oz/999BEEGONE.html). Instead, people could be taught how to avoid bees through repellant.
1.8.2. Pro: Colony collapse disorder is a major issue and is caused, not only by using bee products, but by [diseases](https://www.epa.gov/pollinator-protection/colony-collapse-disorder) too. Helping bees not get ill is as crucial to protecting them as not consuming bee products are.
1.8.3. Pro: Pesticides not directly targeted towards bees \(especially in agriculture\), like [neonicotinoids](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/neonicotinoid-pesticides-slowly-killing-bees), eliminate bee populations too.
1.9. Con: Some bee products are harmless to bees \(such as photographs of them\) and should not be banned.
1.10. Pro: Since animals have evolutionary adaptions to their surroundings, [disturbing bees disrupts their genetic lineage](https://io9.gizmodo.com/why-honeybees-are-a-strange-example-of-darwinian-evolut-1538074226). Care should be done to protect that from happening.
1.10.1. Pro: Disruptions could cause unknown and possibly disastrous consequences \(especially to humans who depend on bees for survival\)
1.10.1.1. Con: Evolution is the history of unknown and, depending on your perspective, disastrous or profitable consequences, based on environmental disruptions.
1.11. Con: -> See 1.3.1.
1.12. Con: Harvesting honey and domesticating bees is an object of cultural value.
1.12.1. Pro: Collecting honey from wild bees is one of humans' most ancient [activities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beekeeping#History_of_beekeeping).
1.12.1.1. Pro: 20.000 years old [cave drawings](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/17/why-are-bees-important) show humans collecting honey.
1.12.2. Pro: Since ancient times there has been a system of high-status apiculture, with hives, smoking pots and honey extractors in [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beekeeping#History_of_beekeeping) \(Crete and Mycenae\).
1.12.2.1. Con: Slavery has ancient Greek pedigree too, but we don't still think that that's acceptable.
1.12.3. Con: Just because humans have done that does not mean it was right and should be worshipped as an important cultural object.
1.12.3.1. Pro: Humans held slaves for thousands of years, nevertheless this practice is not conserved and worshipped as an object of cultural importance.
1.12.3.1.1. Con: A strong argument regarding cultural importance, however, I doubt many people hold slavery of humans on the same morality level as farming products from bees, or any animal for that matter.
1.12.4. Pro: There are 8000 year old cave paintings, such as those in the [Cuevas de la Araña en Bicorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuevas_de_la_Ara%C3%B1a_en_Bicorp).
1.12.5. Con: According to the Cook-DuPage Beekeepers Association, humans have been using honey since about 15,000 B.C., but it was not until the 20th century that people turned bees into factory-farmed animals. Thus the current honey production has nothing anymore in common with the actual tradition. \([peta.org](http://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/whats-wrong-with-eating-honey/)\)
1.12.5.1. Con: Humans have been using honey for more than 17,000 years, but we should stop doing it now because the method has changed? By those standards we should also stop farming corn, wheat, and, well... everything because it hasn't kept in accordance with our original traditions.
1.12.5.2. Con: While there are some which use bees in massive markets, many local beekeepers keep their bees in much the same way as in ancient times.
1.12.6. Pro: The [ancient Egyptians](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/17/why-are-bees-important) brought hives in their boats along the river Nile to pollinate crops.
1.12.7. Pro: Back in the 15th century, the [pilgrim fathers](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/17/why-are-bees-important) took bees with them to spread their kind of farming.
