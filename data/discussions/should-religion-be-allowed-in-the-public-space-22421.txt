Discussion Title: Should religion be allowed in the public space?

1. Should religion be allowed in the public space?
1.1. Pro: The public space should be open to all citizens, no matter what they believe in
1.2. Pro: Absolute neutrality does not exist so it's improper to impose this kind of fake neutrality on citizens in a free democracy
1.3. Con: Most religions are not liberal or democratic so they should not be granted special status in a liberal democratic system
1.4. Con: Allowing religious thoughts to take over the public space might result in an overthrow of the government \(eg. Iran\). This argument was developed by Karl Popper and is called the [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance).
1.5. Pro: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes freedom of religion, implying that a state cannot interfere with this right.
1.6. Con: Allowing religion in the public space, is allowing their perverted mechanisms to extend beyond the public sphere \(eg. women forced to wear a headscarf\)
1.7. Pro: In a liberal democracy there is no good reason to ban any kind of ideology, there is no reason to treat religion differently than political or other ideologies.
1.8. Con: Some religious artefacts can offend or harm people that are confronted with it \(eg. gay vs. extremely religious\)
