Discussion Title: Should public health systems fund homeopathy?

1. Public health care systems should cover the costs of homeopathic treatment.
1.1. Pro: Homeopathic treatments could be used more safely within the public health system.
1.1.1. Con: Homeopaths have not completed medical school. They lack knowledge and expertise about patient health. It is not safe for public health systems to advise patients to see them.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Homeopaths' lack of proper medical training might result in them failing to identify serious health issues.
1.1.1.2. Pro: [Homeopathic vaccinations](https://health.spectator.co.uk/i-used-to-think-homeopathy-was-helpful-now-im-a-critic-so-what-happened/) \(homeoprophylaxis\) are a particular cause of concern. These vaccines do not work. They endanger the herd immunity of the entire population.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: There are instances in which homeopaths have told patients that homeopathic vaccines are [safer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11277990) than conventional vaccines.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Regrettably, many patients who have had homeopathic vaccines have been told that they [do not require](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11277990) conventional vaccines.
1.1.1.2.3. Con: Conventional health practitioners can ensure that homeopathy is not used as a replacement for essential medical care.
1.1.1.2.3.1. Con: To practitioners, awareness of the efficacy of homeopathy should be the same whether is funded by the public health systems or not, assuming that they act upon scientific evidence. Hence, their ability to communicate this to the patient should be the same.
1.1.1.2.3.2. Con: If homeopathic medicine were to be funded and still freely available, people would still be able to get it against the counsel of a practitioner. This would be aggravated by the false sense of security that homeopathy matches other drugs that went through trials.
1.1.1.2.3.3. Con: The issue with homeopathy is not that it is dangerous because of its use, but that it is dangerous because it is used instead of legitimate measures. Allowing it to operate within a publically funded context would increase use, and therefore would increase danger.
1.1.1.2.4. Con: If individuals want homeopathic vaccinations, they are unlikely to stop looking for them just because they are not available on the public health service. They'll get them from the same practitioners they did previously, meaning not much will change.
1.1.1.2.4.1. Con: Doctors should tell patients they oppose homeopathic vaccines, and persuade patients why this is the case. If doctors do this, patients will be less likely to seek homeopathic vaccines elsewhere.
1.1.2. Con: If conventional medical practitioners are persuaded to believe homeopathy is effective they may choose it over conventional treatments, to the detriment of their patients.
1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.3.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Numerous doctors have [suggested](http://whatstheharm.net/homeopathy.html) homeopathic remedies leading to bad outcomes.
1.1.3. Con: Homeopathy is generally a [safe](https://www.sharecare.com/health/homeopathy/what-risks-homeopathic-medicines) treatment anyway. There is no need to regulate it through the public healthcare system.
1.1.3.1. Con: The danger of homeopathy lies not in the possibility of the remedies themselves being actively harmful, but rather through the substitution of conventional medicine allowing a disease to continue when it could have been stopped.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.3.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: There have been [numerous examples](http://whatstheharm.net/homeopathy.html) of homeopathic treatment delaying curative therapy.
1.1.3.2. Con: While homeopathy is generally safe, ineffective oversight outside the public healthcare system means that some pills are produced which pose a serious risk to [health](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/teething-pills-deaths-homeopathic-children-die-taking-remedies-a7359411.html).
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Regulation and oversight can be done without funding for the alternative medicine by the PHS.
1.1.3.3. Pro: The same logic that argues homeopathy is ineffective, due to the [considerable dilution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathic_dilutions) of remedies, also means it is likely safe.
1.1.4. Pro: When things are publicly funded, they come under heightened scrutiny by the public and government. The government could more closely monitor homeopathic practitioners and researchers so they produce more accurate results.
1.1.4.1. Con: Public funding of homeopaths is not necessary to increase scrutiny of the profession. The government could simply pass legislation which all homeopathic practitioners must abide by.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Regulations could be placed on homeopathy without publicly funding it, but there would be more control - more incentive for practitioners to document compliance with government regulations - if their funding depended on it.
1.1.5. Con: It is perverse to argue that homeopathy should be funded to make it safer. If there are significant risks from homeopathy then we should take measures that reduce the number of practitioners, not increase them.
1.1.6. Pro: Government support provides a framework of trust for patients that they would otherwise lack. It establishes standards and qualifications that protect consumers from the less ethical practitioners. Without government support consumers will choose alternative treatments anyway but without any protection.
1.1.6.1. Con: Government support lending trust to ineffective treatments is counter to the goal of protecting the public health. There's no way to protect patients who choose ineffective treatments, other than making those treatments harder to get.
1.1.7. Con: Homeopathic treatment is [not more useful than using a placebo](https://consultations.nhmrc.gov.au/files/consultations/drafts/nhmrcdrafthomeopathyinformationpaper140408.pdf). This claim is also supported by a study from 2014 from Australia. So homeopathy may be used, but only in cases where the use of a placebo would also be okay and it should only be used if a more legitimate way of treatment has been checked by a doctor.
1.1.7.1. Con: Placebos are cheaper.
1.1.8. Pro: Yes, if the treatment has been evaluated and approved by the FDA and is directed by a doctor like other prescriptions. If the government is going to fund treatment, it makes sense that the government should verify that the treatment reasonably is effective for what it is being used for.
1.1.8.1. Con: A treatment evaluated and approved by the FDA would not be considered homeopathy.
1.1.8.1.1. Pro: A treatment not approved by the FDA should not be be covered by public health care.
1.1.9. Pro: Homeopathy is used effectively in Brazil. It is prescribed by doctors as part of the public health system.
1.1.9.1. Pro: Homeopathy is often used as a "first line of defence" particularly for psychological and psychiatric conditions.
1.1.9.1.1. Con: A public health system should not buy placebo at the [price of medication](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/homeopathy/). Neither should it make patients spend their money on it.
1.1.9.1.2. Con: For homeopathy's placebo effect to work, it requires doctors to tell patients that they think it will work. This deception is unethical.
1.1.9.1.2.1. Pro: While other placebos are know to be working only through a psychological effect, homeopathy is often described as having an additional effect, working because of some mysterious power from a really small dose of a substance. By approving homeopathy a doctor accepts this idea, which, because there is no proof of it, is misinforming their patient.
1.1.9.1.2.1.1. Pro: Other placebos do not necessitate the spreading of scientific illiteracy.
1.1.9.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Homeopathy is based on the basic  [scientific misunderstanding](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/reference/homeopathy/) that molecules that are not present can leave an "imprint". The government should not legitimise this level of science denial.
1.1.9.1.2.1.2. Con: The doctor should \(correctly\) inform the patient of the doctor's beliefs. If \(as stated above\) the doctor truly believes that homeopathy works, then saying so is not "misinformation," and the government should in no way restrict the doctor from stating his/her opinion.
1.1.9.1.2.2. Pro: The National Health and Medical Research Council reviewed evidence from 176 trials to determine if homeopathy was a valid treatment option. The [evidence](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/homeopathy-therapeutic-dead-end-systematic-review-no-evidence-it-works-a6884356.html) demonstrated that homeopathy was no more effective than a placebo.
1.1.9.1.2.2.1. Con: There are [questionable aspects](https://livingnow.com.au/homeopaths-call-on-government-to-reveal-the-truth-about-missing-report/) of the 2015 NHMRC report that have not been reported by media. There were actually two reports, but the first was not made public due to positive findings. There were [several flaws](https://livingnow.com.au/homeopathy-under-threat/) in the way the report was prepared, not least of which was the absence of anyone qualified in homeopathy on the review board, and that the chair of the review board is well known to have a strong anti-naturopathy bias.
1.1.9.1.2.2.1.1. Con: You don't need homeopathic experts to makes review of studies on homeopathy.
1.1.9.1.2.3. Pro: The medical principle of informed consent requires that patients be accurately informed of the efficacy of their treatments.
1.1.9.1.2.3.1. Pro: It is wrong to use the authority held by a medical professional to mislead people about what they are putting in their bodies.
1.1.9.1.2.4. Con: [It has been shown](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/placebo-can-work-even-know-placebo-201607079926) that the placebo effect still works when it is known to be the placebo effect, strange as it may seem.
1.1.9.1.2.5. Con: Insofar as the patient is getting better and that placebos \(usually sugar pills\) have no side effects, telling a patient that they are undergoing a treatment would be ethical, even if the treatment is simply a placebo.
1.1.9.1.2.5.1. Con: In FDA \(US medicines authorising body\) trials of new drugs, all side effects must be reported. The package insert then lists the incidence of adverse events, and compares the rate to incidence in the placebo group. Surprisingly, the incidence of side effects of varying severity is not zero in the placebo group.
1.1.9.1.2.5.1.1. Con: Placebos, definitely, have no active ingredients. To the extent which they appear to have side effects these derive from the baseline rate of symptoms and diseases everyone experiences.
1.1.9.1.2.6. Pro: People can be on multiple treatments and need to be accurately informed for the treatments to work properly. For example, people on antidepressants can't be on certain heart medications; if they are misinformed about the former they can't tell their heart doctor, which would lead to complications. If people are misinformed about homeopathy, they will misinform their other doctors.
1.1.9.1.2.6.1. Con: Homeopathic remedies are essentially [just water.](https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4034) It will not lead to complications with other drugs.
1.1.9.1.2.6.2. Con: When prescribing a homeopathic treatment, doctors can list drugs that the homeopathic remedy could interact with.
1.1.9.1.2.6.2.1. Con: There is nothing in a homoeopathic drug to interact with another one.
1.1.9.1.3. Con: Psychological and psychiatric conditions have their own proper treatment and using placebo to treat them would be unethical from the doctor's perspective.
1.1.9.2. Con: Homeopathy can not be used effectively when every evidence suggests otherwise. Obviously homeopathy is used despite all the evidence.
1.1.9.3. Con: There is no evidence provided for the assertion that it is used effectively. All the systematic review evidence about homeopathy suggests the opposite is true. It would have to show greater benefit than the next best standard of care.
1.1.10. Pro: When a person with an illness chooses to attend a homeopath with an ailment, rather than a traditional practitioner, there is a risk of a diagnosis being missed; if homeopaths are more regulated and involved in public health systems this risk is minimised.
1.1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.2.
1.1.10.2. Pro: Patients with healthcare concerns should see their doctor straight away. If they visit a homeopath instead, there is a risk that by the time the patient visits their doctor, their condition might have progressed and become more serious and harder to treat.
1.2. Pro: Funding homeopathy would encourage people to use the public health system.
1.2.1. Con: People need no additional incentive to receive free or subsided care if they are sick.
1.2.1.1. Con: Those who don't trust/believe in conventional medicine are currently either paying out-of-pocket for homeopathy, or going without care. Public funding for homeopathy, if linked to a requirement that conventional physicians provide the care or referrals, would incentivize more people to seek care sooner, by reducing/eliminating the cost barrier.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: The funding for homeopathic treatments could instead be directed at campains to promote trust in PHS and conventional medicine, and scientific literacy.
1.2.2. Con: People tend not to use the public health system because of a deep distrust of conventional medicine, doctors, and their connection to the establishment. The provision of homeopathic remedies by that system will not change this.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Current purveyors of homeopathic remedies will have a financial incentive to portray the treatments provided by the public system as ineffective, just as they do in the status quo. They will influence their clients to believe that their remedies are the only effective ones.
1.2.3. Pro: Funding homeopathy ensures that homeopaths are more likely to direct patients who are skeptical of mainstream healthcare towards other parts of the public healthcare system.
1.2.3.1. Con: Homeopathy is based on a rejection of basic scientific truth. Homeopaths even refer to all mainstream medicine with the pejorative term "[allopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopathic_medicine)". Interaction with the public healthcare system will not reverse this scepticism.
1.2.3.2. Pro: This is because homeopaths will feel less threatened by the public healthcare system if they are a part of the system.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: Individuals who professionally pursue homeopathy are likely to be sceptical of mainstream science and medicine in any case. Giving them money will not change that.
1.2.3.3. Pro: When homeopaths are a part of the public health care system, they are more likely to develop good working relationships with other mainstream healthcare professionals. This will increase the likelihood of homeopaths referring skeptical patients towards mainstream medicine.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: Prosecuting homeopaths who fail to refer patients with serious medical issues to mainstream healthcare professionals can achieve the same end without funding a useless treatment.
1.2.4. Con: Engaging people in public healthcare is only justified when the system provides them with effective treatment and actual health benefits.
1.2.5. Con: Encouraging participation by funding treatments that have no basis supporting their efficacy drains resources and funding from treatments that actually do things.
1.2.6. Pro: The ability to receive subsidised care, for this often expensive treatment, will be a strong encouragement to participate in the public health system.
1.2.6.1. Con: The scepticism towards PHS seems to have risen mainly due to increased education amongst patients and the depersonalization/dehumanization of the system.[\(1\)](https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/16/1/4/527391)[\(2\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5340761/) ["The less trust patients have in future health care, the more they will be inclined to use \[complementary and alternative medicines\]"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16848897) The use of alternative medicines seems to follow the lack of trust \(thus participation\) in PHS.[\(3\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1544335/) Homeopathy not being funded is not a significant motive for the lack of participation PHS.
1.2.6.2. Pro: While the remedies themselves are often relatively cheap the consultations can be [expensive](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/homeopathy/).
1.2.7. Pro: Funding homeopathic treatments will improve relationships between homeopathic practitioners and conventional medical practitioners.
1.2.7.1. Con: Medical doctors study years and years to have their position be equated somehow to someone who could not have studied anything, but is allowed to sell homeopathic remedies. It is impossible in this way to improve relationships between the two parties.
1.2.7.1.1. Con: Homeopathic Doctors also study for many years. [List of Required Schooling/Qualifications](https://study.com/articles/How_to_Become_a_Homeopathic_Doctor_Education_and_Career_Roadmap.html),[How to Become a Homeopath](http://www.santanapeten.com/schools-of-homeopathic-medicine.html), [List of Homeopathic Schools](http://www.wholehealthnow.com/homeopathy_info/weblinks2.html).
1.2.7.2. Pro: With the option of receiving funding to help them provide care homeopathic practitioners are more likely to engage in with the conventional medical system.
1.2.7.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.3. Pro: There are mechanisms by which homeopathic treatments may work for certain conditions.
1.3.1. Con: Homeopathic remedies consist of substances that have have been diluted so many times, that [virtually none](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy) of the original substance is left. This is not an effective treatment option.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Homeopathy is [based](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-37557083) on the concept of diluting a substance which causes illness will have healing properties, with the more diluted a substance, the greater the effect. Treatments are often one part substance, 99 parts water or alcohol, repeated six or 30 times for 6c or 30c formulations, and then combined with a sugar tablet. The scientific consensus around this method is that patient are simply getting a sugar pill.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: For remedies at 30C, a common dilution, the chance that there's a single molecule of the original left in the entire batch, much less an individual dose, is so vanishingly small as to be nonexistent. [A primer is here.](https://inscientioveritas.org/homeopathy-diluted-out-of-existence/?)
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Hahneman, the father of Homeopathy, advocated for solutions of homeopathic compounds diluted by a factor of 10^60. Per [Avagadro's #,](https://www.physics.smu.edu/pseudo/AlternativeMedicine/) this would mean the volume of fluid you'd consume likely doesn't contain any molecules of the original substance. It's just dilutant. The homeopath's explanation is that the solution retains the essential properties of the diluted substance. There is no good scientific evidence to support this claim. Any effects are likely placebo. It would be a waste of resources.
1.3.1.2. Con: The process of homeopathic dilution is assumed to thin out molecules to the point where the chance of any being included in a dose is vanishingly small. However, experiments by Kurt Geckeler and Shashadhar Samal [have shown](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1532-bizarre-chemical-discovery-gives-homeopathic-hint/) that dilution does not always work that way. In polar solvents like water and alcohol, molecules clump together instead of dispersing, so the diluted solution can contain many times the number of molecules as would be expected from conventional theory.
1.3.2. Pro: Homeopathic remedies can elicit particularly powerful placebo effects.
1.3.2.1. Pro: The [placebo effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo#How_the_placebo_effect_works) can be very powerful, and can improve people's health.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: There is good evidence that placebos [work](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1504023) for a large variety of symptoms.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: This depends on what you mean by "work". If you mean improve subjective endpoints \(like self reported pain or mental state\) more than doing nothing, but less than actual effective medicine, then they "work". If you mean actually affect real, non-subjective outcomes \(like mobility measures, mortality, tumor size etc.\), then they do not. [sciencebasedmedicine.org](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/is-harnessing-the-power-of-placebo-worthwhile-to-treat-anything/)
1.3.2.1.2. Con: Homeopathy presents itself as curative, which, even if it works on symptoms via a placebo effect, is deceitful. Thus it should not be used within the health system.
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: The placebo effect is real, and it is ethical to use it in conjunction with conventional therapies, by expressing confidence that the treatment will work, thus encouraging the patient to be optimistic, \(as well as be compliant with treatment\). But the 'placebo effect' is different from ascribing benefit to the actions of the placebo, per se. This does not justify lying about the efficacy of the actual treatment, which is unethical.
1.3.2.1.4. Pro: [This study](http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/65/2/401) found drops in systolic blood pressure between 5 and 8 mmHg in the placebo arm of trials for new anti-hypertensive medications. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the placebo effect is real.
1.3.2.1.4.1. Con: One study is never enough to extend out to any real conclusions. Most studies show that placebo effects are [small or non-existent](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/is-harnessing-the-power-of-placebo-worthwhile-to-treat-anything/) if you stick to measurable endpoints.
1.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.
1.3.2.3. Con: This will lead patients to ascribe the benefits of the placebo effect specifically to homeopathic remedies. This means that they will be more likely to believe that homeopathic remedies work, and hence demand them when conventional medicine is actually necessary.
1.3.2.4. Pro: A homeopath has an opportunity to build a strong therapeutic relationship with a patient, this relationship is an important component of the [placebo effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo#How_the_placebo_effect_works).
1.3.2.4.1. Pro: A study looking at the efficacy of homeopathy for rheumatoid arthritis symptoms concluded that, while the remedy had no effect, the consultation was itself therapeutic \([Brein, S. et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21076131)\).
1.3.2.4.1.1. Con: "A study", in and of itself, isn't worth much when speaking to the overall consensus of the body of evidence. You can find "a study" to prove almost anything you like. All studies add to the consensus though. If they are of rigorous enough quality to get through the selection process. These literature reviews/meta analysis/systematic reviews are what people should be looking at.
1.3.2.4.2. Con: Medical professionals such as psychologists who have formal training are better suited to develop therapeutic relationships with patients.
1.3.2.4.2.1. Con: Some people don't feel comfortable with a psychologist or mainstream therapist because of stigma. The rituals surrounding homeopathy give them an excuse to explore and communicate their emotions.
1.3.2.5. Con: Placebo is significantly [less powerful](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/is-harnessing-the-power-of-placebo-worthwhile-to-treat-anything/) than the average person believes lately. In effect it's just people wanting things to work and giving providers they trust the benefit of the doubt.
1.3.2.6. Con: If you want to maximize placebo then you need an intervention that's either [invasive](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/surgery-is-one-hell-of-a-placebo/), [expensive](https://www.marketplace.org/2015/03/03/health-care/how-cost-drug-impacts-placebo-effect), or delivered by a charismatic practitioner. Preferably all three. Homeopathy is definitely not intrusive, significantly less expensive than some alternatives and not always associated with charisma. Thus it should be seen as a weak way to elicit a placebo effect.
1.3.2.7. Pro: There is often a culture around homeopathy that makes placebo effects likely.
1.3.2.7.1. Con: The culture around homeopathy \(e.g. taking more time for the patient\) has good aspects. They can be implemented into a medical system that doesn't need esoteric concepts to explain itself.
1.3.2.8. Con: Accepting that homeopathic remedies can provide a powerful effect as a placebo does not justify its funding, as it is an overpriced placebo after all.
1.3.2.8.1. Pro: Doctors should prescribe sugar pills or some other placebo which are equally effective as homeopathy to achieve the same end.
1.3.2.8.1.1. Pro: Sugar pills are cheaper to prescribe than homeopathic treatments.
1.3.2.8.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.1.1.
1.3.2.8.1.3. Con: Sugar pills may actually have a negative effect \(for example, to a diabetic\). Prescribing water with nothing in it is better than prescribing sugar pills.
1.3.2.8.1.4. Con: The elaborate explanation surrounding homeopathy, and the fact that some patients already believe it, means that it cannot be simply replaced with sugar pills.
1.3.2.9. Con: To say that any specific remedy has a "particularly powerful placebo effect" is nonsense. "Placebo effect" by definition, is an improvement produced by giving the patient an inert\(ineffective\) substance. Therefore, no "particularly" strong effect can be ascribed to the substance itself.
1.3.3. Pro: Just because modern science cannot explain the mechanisms by which homeopathy works does not mean they do not exist.
1.3.3.1. Pro: The history of scientific thought is full of ideas which have been [proven incorrect.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superseded_scientific_theories) It is possible that our current understanding of how molecules function is inadequate.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: That's a pretty grand idea that would require very specific and overwhelming evidence \(because the evidence that we understand how molecules work is pretty overwhelming\).  Research into Homeopathy hasn't come even a tiny little bit close to the beginning of the start that you'd need to think about the idea that you might consider doing some pilot studies to see if it might be feasible to do real research.  There's no there, there.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: Even if molecules do behave in manners we do not understand, that doesn't mean we can go around inventing an idea about their behavior and claiming it as true.
1.3.3.2. Con: It may be the case that there are mechanisms through which homeopathy could work that modern science cannot yet explain. However, that doesn't mean that we should blindly accept that these mechanism exist, without first having evidence.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: If these mechanisms did exist, then one would expect to find evidence that homeopathic remedies were effective at treating disease beyond the level of a placebo effect. The vast majority of studies reflect that this is not the case.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.2.
1.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: We have tools \(double blind studies\) which clearly demonstrate that homeopathy does not work. There is no mechanism to discover and nothing to measure.
1.3.3.3. Pro: Many drugs are approved for use even though scientists are unsure exactly how they work. For example, the exact mechanism of action for paracetamol is [unknown](https://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i29/Does-Acetaminophen-Work-Researchers-Still.html), and it is still commonly prescribed.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: This is a common alt health trope. We basically know how [anti-depressants work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10086478). To the extent we don't, the holes in our knowledge are in how certain brain chemistry changes affect consciousness. This is different from "the water contains magic memory of stuff in it that is made more powerful by being diluted out of existence with shaking while curing your ailments through the sympathetic magic of like cures like \([see description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy#Preparations_and_treatment)\)." This doesn't align with our understanding of physics.
1.3.3.3.2. Con: Even if the exact mechanism for how many antidepressants work is unknown, the majority of [scientific evidence](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-43143889) suggests that they do work. No such evidence exists for homeopathic remedies.
1.3.3.3.3. Con: There is an actual drug in Acetaminophen. An actual chemical that theoretically could be doing actual things. This is not the case for homeopathy, thus bringing it up doesn't indicate that homeopathy could possibly work.
1.3.3.3.4. Con: The mechanism of action of a treatment is of less importance than evidence that it works. There is no evidence for beneficial effects \(beyond placebo\) of homeopathy.
1.3.3.4. Con: The issue isn't in accepting a lack of understanding as to how homeopathic treatments work, but rather a lack of evidence that they do in fact work.
1.3.3.5. Con: All of the claimed mechanisms for homeopathy are outside of our current understanding of the physical world. Therefore they are not plausible.
1.3.3.6. Con: Using that logic, the same argument could be made for lack of proof for the existence of God. We do not expect public funding to be used for faith healing so let's not waste money on homeopathy.
1.3.3.6.1. Con: Religious organizations in the U.S. typically are exempt from paying taxes\(i.e. they receive government support\), due to a historical premise that organized religion provides a social good \(caring for the poor, instilling good values in children\). Thus the parent pro may have a point, about an effect that cannot be explained.
1.3.3.7. Pro: Conventional allopathic medicines are not 100% effective, often have bad side-effects, and usually suppress symptoms \(potentially interfering with the body’s healing mechanisms\) rather than fixing the underlying cause. These are often the reasons why people try alternative approaches, ones that aim to fix the underlying cause. To them, any such approach is worth taking seriously given the potential benefits. They rarely reject it on the grounds that the mechanism is not currently understood.
1.3.3.8. Pro: Science is underpinned with privileges and cultures- for instance scientific testing has been shown to have [a bias](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/30/fda-clinical-trials-gender-gap-epa-nih-institute-of-medicine-cardiovascular-disease) towards certain groups of the population, certain contexts and others are neglected or their experiences not considered seriously. In knowing this we know that the disproof of Homeopathy is not 100%.
1.3.3.8.1. Con: The burden of proof is on the side of those claiming effectiveness.
1.3.3.8.2. Con: Disproof is not required, since, what is required, is proof. Even so, knowing that there is simply no physiological or chemical mechanism which would allow homeopathy to work more than a placebo, even so, it has been put to the test not once nor twice but hundreds of times, in double blind controlled environments. If there were any power in homeopathy, it would have easily shown up in such tests.
1.3.3.8.3. Pro: [Most RCTs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5366148/) of homeopathy are poor quality and of non-individualised remedies, so the results of those trials are questionable. A major tenet of homeopathy is that the treatment be tailored to the individual patient. An allopathic-style RCT to see if one particular remedy helps with one particular symptom is not going to give conclusive results about homeopathy. Reviews of trials that take this into account show positive outcomes and that more research is justified, e.g. [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4326322/) and [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1668980/).
1.3.3.8.3.1. Con: First, homeopathy should have a scientific base to explain its mechanism, in order to use the argument of it being wrongly used. For an hypothesis to be considered acceptable, it must be proven step by step. Pretending to increase complexity without demonstrating the effectivity of its basic concepts just messes up the process and is not considered scientific method.
1.3.3.9. Con: The fact that a specific mechanism may make sense to some doesn't mean it has a biological basis - it may make sense only considering the fundamentals of homeopathy, which has never been proven to work for any condition at all, in a correctly conducted study.
1.3.3.9.1. Con: [An analysis](http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/179/24/628) of peer-reviewed publications on the efficacy of homeopathy in treating livestock concludes: "In a considerable number of studies, a significant higher efficacy was recorded for homeopathic remedies than for a control group. Therefore, the potential medical efficacy of homeopathy under certain conditions cannot be ruled out." The placebo effect does not come into play when the patient is not aware that they're being given a treatment.
1.3.3.9.1.1. Con: The same study [concluded](http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/179/24/628) that: 'Due to a lack of prognostic validity, replacing or reducing antibiotics with homeopathy currently cannot be recommended unless evidence of efficacy is reproduced by RCTs and proven in various farm practice conditions.'
1.3.3.9.1.1.1. Pro: One single study is not enough to undo the research published in many other studies.
1.3.3.9.1.2. Con: People are not livestock. It needs to be shown that what applies to livestock can apply to people.
1.3.3.9.1.3. Con: Placebo was described working even on animals - [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSXnU9Pf2A).
1.3.3.9.1.4. Con: This is not the same standard of effectiveness we hold for conventional medicine
1.3.3.9.2. Pro: Even in science, things that could work based on their mechanism sometimes don't, and often the quest to understand why they don't leads to more interesting questions and discoveries.
1.3.4. Pro: Homeopaths suggest a number of ways that homeopathy could work.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Homeopaths claim that, as in the [harmonic resonance](https://homeopathic.com/why-homeopathy-makes-sense-and-works-3/) of musical notes, like is attracted to like in the natural world. Therefore, trace amounts of a substance can have disproportionate impacts on health.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Homeopaths claim that tiny amounts of substances that cause illnesses can cure those illnesses by stimulating the [immune system.](https://draxe.com/homeopathy/)
1.3.4.2.1. Con: The quantities of substances in homeopathic remedies are so [diluted](https://inscientioveritas.org/homeopathy-diluted-out-of-existence/) that there is no scientific explanation as to how they could affect any aspect of the immune system.
1.3.4.3. Con: The original theory of homeopathy, that like cures like, was based on the essentially [spurious association](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1676328/) between quinine ingestion and malaria symptoms.
1.3.4.4. Con: The fact that homeopaths suggest a mechanism by which it works, in the absence of either scientific basis or a track record of results, is not persuasive that it does work.
1.3.4.5. Con: It is obvious that proponents of an ideology claim that it could work. It is almost circular logic.
1.3.4.6. Con: -> See 1.3.3.5.
1.3.4.7. Pro: Hormesis \(a process in which exposure to a low dose of a chemical agent or environmental factor that is damaging at higher doses induces an adaptive beneficial effect on the cell or organism\) is a proven scientific phenomenon. We were not aware of X-rays until we had a means to detect them, so who can say that structural changes to the homeopathic carrier do not in fact exist and cannot have an impact on human physiology/biochemistry.
1.3.4.7.1. Con: It is possible this mechanism could exist. It's also possible that unicorns exist. But until there is evidence that either homeopathy or unicorns exist, they will both be rejected as unsupported mythology.
1.3.5. Con: Even with a plausible mechanism, any treatment needs statistical evidence to prove that it really works.
1.3.6. Con: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence \([Sagan Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagan_standard)\).
1.3.6.1. Pro: No one has proven that a substance \(like water\) can keep memory of physical properties of another active substance. Scientifically, strongly proving that this kind of extraordinary effect can happen would lead to a Nobel prize in chemistry to its discoverer, if it could really happen.
1.3.7. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.2.
1.3.8. Pro: Support for homeopathy, an alternative treatment method which is often accompanied by lifestyle changes in diet and exercise, may lead to a prevention and lifestyle change discussion with patients reducing the high cost burden of chronic illness later on.
1.3.8.1. Con: Lifestyle changes are often very important but medical personnel can recommend a more healthy life without the use of expensive placebos.
1.3.8.2. Pro: Homeopathy is a system based on making each person [healthier](https://www.homeopathycenter.org/what-is-homeopathy#differ) without causing side problems. Fixing disease is a part of it, but stimulating the body-mind-spirit for long term health means there will be less disease. The British royal family, who [support homeopathy](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-charles/10433939/Prince-Charles-and-homeopathy-crank-or-revolutionary.html), are a good example: it would be good to be as healthy as Queen Elizabeth and her mother who lived to be 101. Homeopathy offers health with simple doses. That is the kind of health system we need.
1.3.8.3. Con: The only reason homeopathy ever worked at all is because it [came about](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1676328/) at a time when conventional medicine revolved around concepts like bloodletting and generally did more harm than good. Homeopathy, which originally included lots of rest and strict dietary requirements, worked by simply not making things worse. With today's medicine, which already includes this concept, and today's homeopathy, which no longer contains the bits of good advice from the original methods, those benefits are lost.
1.3.9. Pro: Homeopathic consultations take into account more of the patient's condition than just the symptoms allopathic treatment would focus on. This helps the patient feel they're being treated like a person rather than a disease, so they're more likely to follow advice given. It can also uncover deeper problems that are the root cause of their symptoms.
1.3.9.1. Pro: Doctors prescribing homeopathy take more time for their patients, resulting in a better understanding of their medical histories. [zeit.de](https://www.zeit.de/2010/50/Homoeopathie/seite-3)
1.3.9.2. Con: Doctors should not humor or pander to ignorance for the sake of "earning" patient trust.
1.3.10. Pro: Homeopathy could be used in specific circumstances where conventional medical treatments may do more harm than good.
1.3.10.1. Con: It isn't fair or accurate for homeopaths to characterize conventional medicine as 'damaging and unnecessary.' Labeling conventional medicine in this way increases the likelihood of patients not taking treatments which they need.
1.3.10.2. Con: This legitimizes the narrative of homeopathy, which labels [conventional medicine as harmful and ineffective](http://www.pbhrfindia.org/a-new-beginning-2/122-differences-between-homeopathy-and-conventional-medicine.html).
1.3.10.3. Pro: An expanded program to fund mental health and psychological support might include funding of homeopathic treatments as a means of treating symptoms identified as psychosomatic.
1.3.10.3.1. Con: There is no evidence that homeopathy is an adequate treatment for psychosomatic or psychiatric disorders.
1.3.10.3.2. Con: It makes no financial sense to pay for homeopathic consultations just to achieve a placebo effect in such a situation when conventional placebo is readily available and can be prescribed directly by the practitioner without the extra consultation costs associated with homeopathy
1.3.10.4. Con: Homeopathy is defined as treatment by an agent that has been dramatically diluted, so as to stimulate the body. The amount of dilution prescribed by practitioners is so great that there may or may not be one molecule of the substance in the dose given. Theoretically, this cannot work. It does not work if tested scientifically. Paying for useless treatments opens the door to paying for anything an entrepreneur would try to convince people would work.
1.3.10.4.1. Pro: Given that homeopathic treatments do not contain any active ingredients, their beneficial effect is, statistically, zero.  That means that any benefit:negative effect ration will, mathematically, be zero for any homeopathic "remedy."
1.3.10.5. Pro: It is in line with the Hippocratic Oath - to help, or at least do no harm. So doctors should help in any way they can.
1.3.10.5.1. Con: The Hippocratic oath is only the historical basis. Today physicians swear on [modified and modernized versions​](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/hippocratic-oath-today.html).
1.3.10.5.2. Con: The principle ["first do not harm" \(primum non nocere\)​](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere), does not imply general neglect of interventions. It only reminds that the risks have to be balanced with the benefits.
1.3.10.5.3. Con: General avoidance of interventions because of belief in ineffective remedies \(like homeopathy\) can lead to avoidable complications.
1.3.10.5.4. Pro: All well researched holistic medicine has listed fewer side effects than allopathic or Western medicine.  Just read product safety sheets on allopathic medicine for evidence.
1.3.10.5.5. Con: They already do. Doctors already search for the best possible treatment, and if they do not recommend homeopathy is because its efficacy has not been supported, and the placebo effect is best achieved using cheaper methods.
1.3.10.5.6. Con: "Help" should include honestly informing the patient of their options, not pandering to a demand for a treatment. Patients can be helped by being told that their disease will improve spontaneously. They can also be harmed by being charged for, and told to administer, an ineffective treatment.
1.3.10.6. Pro: Patients often visit their doctor for simple coughs and colds and demand antibiotics. It is cheaper for a public healthcare system to direct patients towards homeopathy instead.
1.3.10.6.1. Con: Doctors should explain to patients that they do not need any treatment, instead of giving them homeopathic treatments.
1.3.10.6.1.1. Pro: Doctors should challenge the narrative that patients are entitled to medicine. If they do not, patients will continue to  put pressure on  healthcare professionals to give them drugs which they do not need.
1.3.10.6.1.2. Pro: Any money spent on homeopathy would be better spent on treatments which are proven to be efficacious.
1.3.10.6.1.3. Con: Patients who feel unwell may simply seek treatment elsewhere. This could erode their faith in conventional medicine.
1.3.10.6.1.3.1. Con: Experiences of conventional healthcare do not appear to be important drivers of people's use of alternative medicines \([Bishop et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20180690)\)
1.3.10.6.2. Con: It would also be cheaper to give them lollypops and send them on their way.  And [similarly effective to homeopathy](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/apr/03/homeopathy-why-i-changed-my-mind).
1.3.10.6.2.1. Con: Lollypops cause tooth decay, a risk which is avoided by using homeopathic remedies.
1.3.10.6.2.1.1. Con: Homeopathic sugar pills might cause tooth decay as well.
1.3.10.6.2.2. Pro: [Prayer](http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/can-prayer-heal#1) has more proven success and is less expensive than homeopathic treatment.
1.3.10.6.3. Con: It isn't cheaper to direct toward homeopathy as the markup is large for the companies involved. Unbranded sugar pills can be manufactured very cheaply by health authorities.
1.3.10.6.4. Con: Only [16%](https://theconversation.com/what-does-the-public-really-think-about-homeopathy-21827) of UK adults believe that homeopathy is as effective as conventional medicine. Patients who demand antibiotics will continue to do so and the effect will be marginal at best.
1.3.10.6.5. Con: Homeopathy's use by doctors is worse than the use of other placebos, as it carries with it wider risks to society. If the problem is over use of antibiotics, using homeopathy as placebo raises both moral questions, and causes the public to believe homeopathy has some kind of scientific backing to it.
1.3.10.6.6. Pro: In the US 1 in 3 antibiotics prescribed are [unnecessary.](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0503-unnecessary-prescriptions.html)  This increases the risk of antibiotic resistance and is no more effective than the [placebo effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo#How_the_placebo_effect_works) of homeopathy.
1.3.10.6.6.1. Con: While antibiotic resistance is dangerous, antibiotics do successfully cure infections and are often necessary. Antibiotics are in no way related to homeopathy for which there is no proven benefit at all.
1.3.10.6.6.2. Con: Balancing one unscientific problem \(overprescription of antibiotics\) with another unscientific problem \(lack of effectiveness and side effects of homeopathy\) is not a solution.
1.3.10.6.6.3. Con: The decision whether to use antibiotics or not relies on the doctor who prescribes them, not the patient. It is the doctor who has the knowledge and experience to make such decision. Doctors spend a lot of time informing themselves about new research posted and are totally aware of the problems that antibiotics present. If they prescribe them, it is because they consider there is no better choice. Refusing to hear their informed advice would be highly irresponsible.
1.3.10.6.7. Pro: There is [some evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804695/) that using homeopathy can reduce the number of antibiotics used for acute otitis media, a disease which should only be treated with antibiotics in [specific circumstances.](http://www.choosingwisely.org/patient-resources/antibiotics-for-ear-infections-in-children/)
1.3.10.6.7.1. Con: We need an study that compares homeopathic ear drops and placebo ear drops.
1.3.10.7. Pro: Some drugs [build up to toxic levels](https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/info-08-2010/toxic-drugs-when-medicine-makes-you-sick.html), leaving the patient with no other option than to seek alternative treatments.
1.3.10.7.1. Con: Patients should rely on their doctor in medication decisions. If the best medication that can be use has side-effects or can become toxic is something that the doctor will bear in mind. Substituting proper medicine with placebo does not solve the problem.
1.3.10.7.2. Con: Alternative treatments are such because they are not cost-effective or their effectiveness has not been demonstrated at all. That means it will be a waste of public money to finance them. That is why they are called "alternative".
1.3.10.7.3. Con: The article cited states that "Because she was thinner yet still taking the same dose of  baclofen, the drug had built up to toxic levels." She had been taking the same drug for 6 years without ill effects before she lost weight. For cases such as these, prescribing correct dosages of effective drugs with known results is better than providing possibly ineffective alternative treatments or new drugs with unknown results and side-effects.
1.3.10.8. Pro: Conventional treatment for autoimmune diseases generally focuses on managing the symptoms. There is no drug that cures asthma, eczema, rheumatism, etc. The drugs that manage symptoms can have undesirable side-effects. In these cases patients should be able to choose alternatives for which there is evidence of positive outcomes, e.g. statistics published by homeopathic hospitals in the UK NHS.
1.3.10.9. Con: Treatments whose medical efficacy lack a scientific proof are just accepted, and thus administered to, a minority of contributors to the health care system. It would be unfair to use the joint budget of all contributors for a treatment that contributes to a not quantifiable well-being of just a minority.
1.3.10.10. Pro: While homeopathy has no established evidence base, standard pharmacological agents can cause many long term side effects which are not adequately assessed in long term randomised trials. Thus, someone using homeopathy in preference to pharmacology could in principle have better lifetime health outcomes: both systems provide the important health improving placebo effect, but homeopathy sugar pills do that without adverse side effects. More studies are needed to test if this is true.
1.3.10.10.1. Con: Allopathic meds, in order to make it on the market, are tested against placebo. If homeopathy has no more benefits---or harms---than placebo, then we already know that the allopathic meds, used appropriately, result in better health outcomes.
1.3.10.10.2. Con: More long-term follow-up is not needed, when the short-term follow-up shows an increase in deaths in the placebo group due to untreated disease.
1.3.10.11. Con: In 2017, the FDA [recalled](https://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm552934.htm) Hyland's teething tablets due to "inconsistent levels of belladonna alkaloids," a potentially toxic substance. Therefore, the inference that homeopathy is somehow safer is spurious.
1.3.11. Pro: Some unwitting person with a dehydration headache might have drank a glass of water with their homeopathic treatment, that they otherwise wouldn't have.
1.4. Pro: Most homeopathic remedies are well established so cannot be patented. This means there's little commercial interest in trialling or producing them, so public funding is necessary to build up evidence and maintain quality.
1.4.1. Pro: Government support would eliminate the stigma associated with research in this area, allowing unbiased evaluation of the evidence without fear of coercion or ridicule.
1.4.1.1. Con: The government generally withholds support for products until a proof of concept has been created.
1.4.2. Con: Homeopathy is a multi-billion dollar industry. There is money there. The lack of patents actually removes a major barrier for the pharmaceutical industry to get in on it.
1.4.2.1. Pro: The FDA approval process is expensive. If a compound \(such as an herb\) cannot be patented, a company is unlikely to pursue the necessary trials to support its being recognized as medicine.
1.4.3. Con: Public health systems should not fund treatments that have been [proven](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/45/4502.htm) [not to work](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/health-topics/complementary-medicines/homeopathy-review) or have any predictable effect.
1.4.3.1. Con: Medicine itself is an art as much as it is a science. Many treatment decisions are, necessarily, [not supported](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/demand-better-health-care-book/) by strong scientific evidence.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Doctors only prescribe medicine which scientific peer reviewed studies have demonstrated to be effective. If new evidence demonstrates that drugs which were thought to be effective, are not effective, doctors will no longer prescribe them.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: Medicine and medical practice continue to improve, becoming more and more evidence-based. The practice of ineffective treatments has and will, in time, catch up with the science.

Homeopaths, on the other hand, remain impervious to scientific analysis: its claims of effectiveness falsified by countless studies and its core principles have long been incompatible with our physical and chemical knowledge.
1.4.3.1.3. Pro: As pharmaceuticals are not required to, and therefore often do not prove their efficacy, post regulatory approval, and yet despite that fact are publicly funded, then homeopathics should also be funded. See BMJ 2017;357:j1680 for supporting evidence and consider the approved drug [Diclectin](http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/diclectin-pregnancy-nausea-vomiting-persaud-duchesnay-confidential-industry-documents-health-canada-1.4491300) as an example of failure to work any better than placebo.
1.4.3.1.4. Con: When deciding on a treatment, health professionals choose from among a pool of options. The premise that some of these options are not supported by scientific evidence cannot be used in favor of adding a new, not-scientific option in the pool.
1.4.3.2. Pro: It is unethical to prescribe a treatment with no scientific evidence.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: Doctors refuse to prescribe conventional medicine that has been proven to be ineffective, even if the patient insists on it. Doctors should apply the same standard when patients request homeopathy.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Con: Doctors can make mistakes. Patients know their own bodies, and if they're looking into alternative medicines, have probably taken multiple medications in the past as points of comparison. Doctors should trust patients to make decisions for themselves.
1.4.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Their own knowledge of the effects of medications is biased by placebo effect.
1.4.3.2.2.1.2. Con: Feeling better in the short term may lead to worse disease in the long term.
1.4.3.2.2.1.3. Con: The patient's own experience = a sample size of 1 person. Drugs are kept off the market all the time, because they have a 1-in-a-100 chance of a significant side effect. \(in other words, 99 out of 100 people who took it, thought it was great, and would request it again\). One patient may have recovered from an illness, and may assume that the drug/remedy she took is responsible for her recovery. This is not science; it is anecdote. Large case-controlled studies must over-rule patient experience.
1.4.3.2.3. Pro: In 2017 the NHS announced it will no longer provide homeopathic medicine. Its justification was that homeopathy represented a [misuse](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/21/a-misuse-of-scarce-funds-nhs-to-end-prescription-of-homeopathic-remedies) of scarce funding.
1.4.3.2.4. Con: It is unethical to allow someone's suffering to continue when other treatments are known to alleviate it.
1.4.3.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.4.3.2.6. Pro: Homeopathy is a falsely advertised placebo. No public funding should be devoted to placebo instead of researching and funding drugs that really work. While there are cases where a placebo will be more justified then actual intervention with drugs, paying for placebo more then it actually worth is a waste of taxpayers' money and epistemologically irresponsible practice.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Customers always have a choice of paying for alternative treatments. Public money should be saved for proven treatments that have passed peer review.
1.4.3.4. Pro: Anyone can call themselves a [homeopath](https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/homeopath), without any qualifications, as there is [no specific](https://www.britishhomeopathic.org/treatment/regulation/) regulatory body. Taxpayers' money should not be given to individuals  who have no real skills or scientific knowledge.
1.4.3.4.1. Con: Presumably the state could set up its own regulatory body and have a policy of only funding practitioners of who meet its specifications. This would have the added benefit of increasing the incentive for standardisation among practitioners.
1.4.3.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.4.3.4.2. Con: In some parts of the world the [homeopathic industry is growing quickly](https://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/issues/2013-07/view_industry-news/us-sales-of-homeopathic-herbal-remedies-reach-64-billion). As the people using these treatments are taxpayers, their method of treatment should be represented by the public healthcare system that they partially fund.
1.4.3.4.3. Con: Many homeopaths are regulated by Professional Bodies, and some [registers of homeopaths](https://www.britishhomeopathic.org/treatment/regulation/) require this.
1.4.3.5. Con: Consumers within public health systems should be empowered to make their own choices about their treatment.
1.4.3.5.1. Pro: People have a right to choose what kind of treatment they want regarding something as important as their own health.
1.4.3.5.1.1. Con: Given that homeopathy is not banned, that right is upheld in the status quo. They do not have the right, however, to demand that this be  paid for by the general public.
1.4.3.5.1.1.1. Pro: Individuals who wish to use homeopathy as a treatment are perfectly empowered to do so in the private sector - out of their own pocket.
1.4.3.5.1.1.2. Con: This right is only upheld for those who can afford it. Poorer individuals are those denied medical autonomy in the status quo.
1.4.3.5.1.2. Con: Patients are not medical experts. It is irresponsible to give patients the ability to choose how they are treated.
1.4.3.5.1.2.1. Pro: If treatment is on other taxpayers' expense, society has the responsibility to provide as effective and safe treatment as possible. Determining ways to achieve that takes a medical expert's knowledge. Homeopathy - that is, diagnoses and treatment based on uneducated guesswork - are a matter of choice, but not on other taxpayers' expense.
1.4.3.5.1.2.2. Con: Drug companies spend billions in advertisements to encourage patients to ask their doctors to recommend specific medications thus self diagnosing. Alternative treatments should have the same opportunity especially if recommended by a physician or other licensed practitioner much like chiropractic care or massage therapy.
1.4.3.5.1.2.2.1. Con: This is why they are recommended to speak to their doctor, not go online and simply purchase their product. A doctor generally knows how to diagnose, and as such, has the proper ability to suggest treatment. Drug companies are interested in making money; but they also provide a verified product. Alternative treatments should only be considered if they are scientifically shown to work. Chiropractic care, for example, can greatly exaggerate its actual benefit to clients.
1.4.3.5.1.2.3. Con: A patient who is not a medical expert should have the freedom to choose their treatment, but they shouldn't expect public assistance in acquiring that treatment.
1.4.3.5.1.3. Con: Apart from being false, the statement is also irrelevant because homeopathy is not a treatment as it is not proven that it treats.
1.4.3.5.1.4. Con: Public health system is publicly organised and funded with the aim to benefit the public in the most effective and efficient way. Evidence based approaches and cost/benefit analysis are applied to devise the most effective and efficient outcome for the limited amount of funds. Granting individuals an universal right to chose a treatment would therefore detriment the value of public health system. Therefore, within the scope of the system, people don't always have right to chose the treatment.
1.4.3.5.2. Pro: When patients are given the opportunity to have a meaningful say over their treatment options, they are more likely to adhere to treatment plans.
1.4.3.5.2.1. Con: Homeopathy is not an effective treatment option. Therefore, it doesn't matter if patients adhere to it.
1.4.3.5.2.2. Con: Patients should have the ability to have more choice regarding how they are treated, but they should only be able to choose between different treatments which have been proven to be medically effective.
1.4.3.5.2.3. Con: There's already a huge issue with people not finishing a prescribed antibiotics. There's nothing to suggest that would change if people had "a meaningful say over their treatment options."
1.4.3.5.2.4. Con: Treatment choices should only be offered when there is a value judgment required to decide between between conflicting benefits or side effects, hidden costs, etc. In any case where a doctor knows there is an objectively better, worse, or demonstrably ineffective treatment, it is their duty to avoid creating some false controversy for their patients to muddle through.
1.4.3.5.3. Con: The money available to public health systems is limited. One patient's decisions to use homeopathy limits another's access to a more effective treatment.
1.4.3.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.5.1.1.1.
1.4.3.5.3.2. Pro: If we accept that the effectiveness of homeopathy is dubious then it's immoral to provide large sums of public money for such consultations, especially since doing so may limit treatment options for others.
1.4.3.5.3.3. Pro: Over the last decade the NHS \(UK Health System\) spent approximately [£1.75 million](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-spending-funding-homeopathy-homeopathic-treatment-evidence-a7177551.html) on homeopathic treatment. That money could have gone into funding treatments that actually show results.
1.4.3.5.4. Con: -> See 1.4.3.5.1.2.
1.4.3.5.5. Con: The aim of public healthcare systems is to maximize the health of patients. Thus, public healthcare systems should restrict patients from picking ineffective treatment options.
1.4.3.5.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.2.
1.4.3.5.6. Pro: The state has to act on two motivations, one related to cost and the other related to the patient's interest. To withhold a "treatment" that the patient wants can be done on the first of those grounds, but probably not the second. There is therefore an argument that if a person would prefer an ineffective and cheap attempt at a solution over an expensive one which the state will pay for, then the state should not withhold it.
1.4.3.5.6.1. Con: The state should withhold \(not offer\) all and any treatments that are ineffective. Not wasting money providing ineffective treatments is the most efficient use of taxpayer \(i.e. public\) money.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1. Pro: Funding homeopathic treatments would be too expensive for public health systems.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.1. Con: Homeopathic treatments [allocations](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-37557083) in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland total  £5m compared to a £130bn health services budget, or 0.004%, which is a drop in the bucket.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.10.6.1.2.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.2.3.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.2. Pro: Public funding of homeopathy will increase the demand, as it's now available for free. This will make homeopathy even more expensive for the public health system.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.5.3.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.4. Pro: If homeopathy was "rubber stamped" as eligible to use tax money for it, doctors would also prescribe it. This tax money would be missing for needed and effective social causes such as education.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.5. Con: A remedy doesn't exceed 2,5 to 3€. It can't be described "expensive". [pharma-medicaments.com](https://www.pharma-medicaments.com/soins-au-naturel/homeopathie/boiron/)
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.5.1. Con: Its affordability combined with its lack of scientific basis is exactly why it should not be publicly funded. It is not “out of reach” like an $80,000 spinal surgery.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.5.2. Con: On a nationwide basis, when used by millions of people, it can be quite expensive. Presumably the original resolution refers to paying for homeopathic consultations, as well as their remedies. And presumably usage would increase if homeopathy were covered.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.5.3. Con: Any amount of a nation's GDP diverted from other programs \(education, defense, public services\) to fund something that provides no benefit, is too much.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.6. Con: Homeopathy offers remedies that remove major infections that otherwise send people to the emergency rooms or at least doctor's offices, which cost insurances between $100 to $1000. Some basic first aid remedies homeopathy offers remove the need for further action. These remedies only cost $6 to $7 in comparison.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.6.1. Con: The evidence from large studies overwhelmingly finds either that homeopathy is ineffective, or that there is insufficient evidence to support its efficacy.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.2.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: A [2017 meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28340607) of randomised double blind placebo controlled trials of non-individualised homeopathy found that when only well designed studies were considered homeopathy was no better than placebo.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.6.1.3. Pro: A [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1874503/) of systematic reviews in 2002 found that, taken together, the data showed no benefit of homeopathy for any condition over placebo.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.7. Con: -> See 1.3.10.6.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.8. Con: Homeopathic remedies are [dramatically cheaper](https://homeopathic.com/how-much-does-professional-homeopathic-care-cost/) than pharmaceuticals and other traditional treatments. Government funding should be directed towards making more expensive treatment attainable.
1.4.3.5.6.1.1.8.1. Con: This is only justified when the cost is less and the BENEFIT is similar. Cheap treatments that are ineffective, should not be supported just because they are cheap
1.4.3.5.6.2. Con: "What the patient wants" is not synonymous with what is in the patient's best interest. All government benefits require some documentation of qualifying criteria. There is no inconsistency in saying that a treatment must be shown to be effective, before it will be included in the list of covered benefits.
1.4.3.5.6.3. Con: The patient is always allowed to decline the recommendations of a physician, but is not allowed to dictate their preference of treatments\(either to the physician, or the third-party payer\).
1.4.3.5.6.4. Con: The State doesn't have two separate motivations of cost and patient interest. They have a single combined cost/benefit analysis. Think of it as a fraction of benefit over cost. If the ratio is good, the treatment gets funding. If the ratio is poor, it does not. Because there is no evidence of health benefits from homeopathy the state must assume that the ratio is zero and act accordingly by not funding the treatment.
1.4.3.5.6.5. Con: This argument assumes that a patient will have homeopathy instead of another treatment. In reality, because homeopathy does nothing, the patient will not be cured and have to have the other treatment anyway. Therefore the choice is not between the cost of homeopathy or a standard treatment, but instead between the cost of a standard treatment or the standard treatment PLUS the cost of homeopathy.
1.4.3.5.6.6. Con: The assumption that that which interests the patient is also in the patient's interests is false. Perceptions of homeopathy do not influence its efficacy, the underlying biochemical reality does.
1.4.3.5.7. Con: No treatment options are illegal as long as they are not harmful, regardless of their efficacy. That means patients can access homeopathy if they will by paying for it. However, the aim of public healthcare is to support evidence-based treatments, not to give patients whatever they want. Patients are no less empowered for that reason, because they always have the option to access the private sector freely.
1.4.3.5.7.1. Pro: Beneficiaries of public health systems are not consumers, who may choose freely when paying with their own money.  In a public health system medical supply decisions need to follow a democratically determined rule set which is the same for every citizen.
1.4.3.5.7.2. Pro: Public health systems are funded through taxation. Therefore, decisions about how public health systems allocate money, should be decided by society as a whole, and not individual patients.
1.4.3.5.8. Pro: Many diseases have no known cures or effective treatments. Homeopathy can provide symptom relief or may be effective for individuals in specific cases.
1.4.3.5.8.1. Con: Homeopathy will not help patients who have a disease for which there is no cure. Doctors shouldn't lie to patients. It is better that doctors tell patients the truth, rather than give patients false hope.
1.4.3.5.8.2. Con: While things that only cure very specific diseases are still publicly funded, homeopathy not only just "works" in very specific cases, but it is not even curative. Public funding should not go to niche treatments that do not actually cure or prevent the disease they treat.
1.4.3.5.8.3. Con: Homeopathic "treatment" has never, in controlled conditions, proven to be more effetive than a placebo.
1.4.3.5.8.4. Pro: Placebos work on symptoms modulated by the brain, like the perception of pain and can be effective in treating things like pain management and cancer drug side effects. [The power of the placebo effect](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mental-health/the-power-of-the-placebo-effect)
1.4.3.5.9. Con: Funding for public health systems while demands for health care are vast. From equipment to medication, from surgery to geriatric care, the demand for health care can place a tremendous burden on government spending \(and by extension the tax rates borne by the public\). To spend money on treatment with no evidence of efficacy is money wasted. Since costs are shared in a public system, this is unfair to the general public.
1.4.3.6. Con: There are many homeopathic options that work and are scientifically proven, the issue is the pharmaceutical companies spend billions making pills and then use marketing power to spread claimed benefits while blushing over negative side effects. If the insurance companies opened up options to use homeopathic resources,  the ones that work would quickly surface while the snake oil options would also be exposed by open market selection and public reviews of the results.  [takingcharge.csh.umn.edu](https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/explore-healing-practices/homeopathy/-there-good-scientific-evidence-homeopathy)
1.4.3.6.1. Con: That is called "fallacy ad hominem", meaning that you pose that homeopathy is not included in the public system because there are economic interests behind it, thus considering that action unreasoned.
1.4.3.7. Pro: The benefits of homeopathy are only measurable by their secondary benefits, like placebo or better physician care - always unrelated to the treatment itself. We can only fund treatments on their predictable success, not the success of their side effects.
1.4.3.7.1. Con: There are many things that Western medicine can not make sense of until it gains the tools to measure it. It is therefore probable that they have yet the tools to measure it. Its efficacy is all they can study at this point.
1.4.3.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.5.6.1.1.6.1.
1.4.3.9. Con: Many, if not most, of the treatments funded by public health systems have the predictable effect of adverse side effects.
1.4.3.10. Con: If public health care systems cover the costs of some surgeries [www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/study-suggests-common-kne/) with benefits which cannot be explained other than due to the placebo effect, there is no reason to reject homeopathic treatment on grounds of unproven effectiveness.
1.4.3.10.1. Con: Rarely does private insurance cover and public healthcare certainly does not cover the cost of psychoanalytic psychotherapy. This being the case, homeopathic medicine should also not be paid for by public health.
1.4.3.10.2. Con: Even supposing that the study about knee surgery is right, previous mistakes can not be used to justify new mistakes. This argument would be used to justify the funding of each possible therapy that at least caused a placebo effect, which is unsustainable.
1.4.3.11. Pro: In order to qualify for coverage by public health insurance, any treatment should prove that it is effective in rigorous scientific studies.
1.4.3.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.2.
1.4.3.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.4.3.11.3. Con: The only way to prove that something is effective is to allow its use by multiple individuals of varying backgrounds. People are far more likely to try experimental procedures if they are covered by public insurance, which gives the treatment a wider pool of participants, leading to more accurate results.
1.4.3.11.3.1. Con: The above-described "study" would be useless, due to errors of self-selection, self-reporting and non-standardized dosing. A proper study would involve recruiting subjects from various ethnic/age/gender groups, randomizing people to treatment vs. non-treatment, and collecting data on all subjects \(even those who are on placebo, and even those who drop out of the study.\)
1.4.3.11.3.2. Con: Public funding would send a message that the treatment is not experimental. "Experimental" treatments - those with no proven efficacy - are typically excluded from coverage by \(U.S.\) insurance companies and government payers.
1.4.3.11.4. Pro: The concept of "health care" is one that is almost infinitely expandable in public use. To expand covered therapies to every one that has a few advocates would eventually bankrupt the entire system. The idea of "health care" MUST be a carefully delineated one, based on a system of professional boards. Only therapies shown to be "safe and effective" \(like FDA drug requirements\) may be allowed to be covered.
1.4.3.11.5. Pro: The funding of any treatment should be assessed by its success rate. If homeopathy [doesn't stand up in clinical trials](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/homeopathy-failing-randomized-controlled-trials-since-1835/), then it cannot be funded at the expense of treatments that do stand up in clinical trials.
1.4.3.11.5.1. Pro: To ensure the long term financial stability of public health systems, funds must be concentrated on procedures and medicines with a track record of success. Homeopathic treatments should only be funded as a last resort in the event conventional, proven methods are unsuccessful.
1.4.3.11.6. Pro: Public health systems are an investment in the wellbeing of citizens. Since homeopathy lacks scientific evidence to vouchsafe for its effectiveness, it is not a wise investment.
1.4.4. Con: Government funding would give homeopathic treatments unwarranted legitimacy.
1.4.4.1. Con: If homeopathy is provided within the context of a public healthcare system, patients can be given accurate information about its likely benefits which would have the opposite effect.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Homeopathic remedies would be, in all likelihood, given to patient by practitioners who believe in its benefit. As such they are unlikely to receive neutral advice.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: It is extremely unlikely that somebody who already distrusts mainstream medicine enough that they are at the point of requesting homeopathic remedies would listen to a mainstream medical professional who tries to tell them that those remedies are ineffective.
1.4.4.1.3. Con: Patients can ask their doctor information about homeopathy regardless whether it is publicly financed or not. They can also search in the internet.
1.4.4.2. Con: Despite moves by the medical and scientific professions homeopathy has a rapidly [expanding market](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/homeopathy-product-market-is-expected-to-reach-us174862-million-by-2024-the-market-is-on-a-favorable-growth-curve-in-europe-and-north-america-2017-01-11-62033139). Shutting off Government support doesn't appear to harm its perceived legitimacy by consumers.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: Though the market may be growing on its own, perceived government approval of homeopathic remedies would likely increase the rate of that growth still further.
1.4.4.2.2. Con: It is true that homeopathy's market is growing, but that does not mean that its legitimacy is still intact. Giving governmental support to it would definitely and unwarrantedly improve its reputation. The "appearance" that it seems not to be harmed is a vague claim.
1.4.4.2.3. Con: The availability of public funds covering homeopathic treatments will encourage an expansion in the number of practitioners and vendors for these products.
1.4.4.2.3.1. Pro: Public funding will increase effective demand by reducing the cost for patients. The principle of [supply and demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand) dictates that this will lead to a subsequent increase in supply.
1.4.4.3. Pro: When people have to pay for homeopathy themselves they are more likely to do their own investigating into the evidence for its efficacy. If it's free they are less likely to do this, and thus homeopathy will receive less scrutiny.
1.4.4.4. Pro: Funding homeopathic treatments would legitimise quackery and encourage people to not think critically about medicine.
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: Homeopathic and anti-vaccine views are related. For example[Children who get alternative medicine may be less likely to get flu shots.​](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alternative-medicine-may-be-linked-to-lower-vaccination-rates_us_57f3ce12e4b0703f75911e35)
1.4.4.4.2. Pro: Homeopathy is a scam since all that is actually sold is water / sugar at incredibly exaggerated prices. Funding Homeopathy would be funding the fraudulent sale of water as medication.
1.4.4.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.1.1.1.
1.4.4.5. Pro: Government funding for homeopathy would make pharmaceutical companies invest more in homeopathy, thus would cut valuable research money from more pressing and legitimate research.
1.4.4.6. Pro: If homeopathic treatments were presented as legitimate or alternative treatments then many consumers will believe they are equivalent, which they are not. A patient using homeopathy instead of scientific treatment loses valuable time and allows the disease to progress, thus endangering their health and life.
1.4.4.6.1. Pro: Consumers may fail to choose effectively between homeopathic remedies and effective medicine if they are presented as equivalent in the public healthcare system. Homeopathic treatments tend to be less invasive, appear have fewer side effects and are often less expensive, even if they are not as effective.
1.4.4.6.2. Pro: Patients have a poor understanding of healthcare and rely on the government to tell them what is, and isn't, a legitimate treatment.
1.4.4.6.2.1. Con: Patients have a reasonable understanding of healthcare and with knowledge of the costs and benefits can make rational decisions. It is not the role of government to micromanage people's lives and health. The role of government is to require transparency and prevent fraud.
1.4.4.7. Pro: Awareness should be raised when it comes to scams like homeopathic medicines. Even if the placebo has an effect, it is bad for society to give any credibilty to medical treatment that don't really work. Instead funding can go to scientific studies for REAL solutions and treatments.
1.4.5. Pro: There should be no limits to scientific enquiry, especially limits implied by public funding \(or lack of\) or that are enforced by the State.
1.4.5.1. Con: Treatments should not be funded as 'treatments' until there is evidence to support their efficacy. Funding research is fine, but FDA \(in the U.S.\) approval requires that when a drug is put on the market, all claims of efficacy must be supported by evidence.
1.4.6. Pro: An increase in funding for homeopathy may lead to substantial advances in medicine down the line.
1.4.6.1. Con: If it is not effective now, it should not be funded as treatment. Research studies are typically not funded by public or private healthcare coverage, and participants in clinical trials are informed that the treatment under investigation is unproven.
1.4.6.2. Pro: Some studies have found benefits for homeopathy.
1.4.6.2.1. Pro: A review by the Swiss government [found](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-ullman/homeopathic-medicine-_b_1258607.html) a particularly strong body of evidence to support the homeopathic treatment of Upper Respiratory Tract Infections and Respiratory Allergies.
1.4.6.2.1.1. Pro: A government report is less likely to be influenced by commercial interests and professional agendas.
1.4.6.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.5.6.1.1.6.1.
1.4.6.3. Con: Increasing funding for research into something already disproven is only a waste of money.
1.4.7. Con: Neither funding nor government involvement is needed in any area of homeopathy; the only involvement needed is in testing of the medications for accuracy of contents and dosage, and blocking proven/known harmful treatments. Let what works prove and finance itself, let what does not work fade into history.
1.4.8. Pro: Failure to conduct clinical trials on supplements results in harm when ineffective and harmful treatments are not exposed as such.
1.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.5.
1.6. Con: -> See 1.4.3.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.4.4.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.4.3.5.6.1.1.
1.9. Con: [Research suggests](http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/8568/Dissertation_Da%20Silva_N.pdf.pdf;jsessionid=08AF9FB91F078D968D0A9A0B9A339BDA?sequence=1) that homeopathy is mainly used by the middle class and it’s not in high demand by the majority of public service users. To be effective, it requires an entire lifestyle change and this is just not feasible for most people.
1.10. Con: The use of homeopathy, given its lack of scientific evidence, will undermine people's faith in the public health system.
1.10.1. Con: Very few individuals keep track of the minutiae of public healthcare expenditure.
1.10.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.5.6.1.1.1.
1.10.1.2. Con: The misuse of scarce funds is regularly reported as a scandal in both tabloid and [broadsheet](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/21/a-misuse-of-scarce-funds-nhs-to-end-prescription-of-homeopathic-remedies) media.
1.10.2. Con: The people who would have the most awareness of homeopathy in public health systems are those who want it. They are likely to approve of its use.
1.10.2.1. Con: Approval of the use by a patient does not legitimize a treatment per se.
The patient is not the physician; Whilst the use of scientific knowledge \(technology\) might be democratic, its development and establishment is done between scholars the same way most common people trust farmers to produce their food.
1.10.3. Con: Many individuals see homeopathy as a legitimate treatment option. Thus, if public healthcare systems provide homeopathy, they are reflecting public opinion and reinforcing the public's belief in the healthcare system.
1.10.3.1. Con: Many people like faith healing but it would be inappropriate to put [Benny Hinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Hinn) on the public payroll.
1.10.3.2. Con: Reflecting public opinion is not the goal of an efficient public health system. The goal is for the system to be effective. In the long run, if a system subsidized ice cream that the public opinion wanted, and everybody became diabetic, people would surely come to distrust and not believe in that system.
1.10.4. Pro: There are already healthcare services funded by the government that [may be placebos](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/suffer-the-children/201201/is-psychotherapy-placebo), or may be working but are not possible to validate scientifically, only through intuition.
1.10.4.1. Con: Just because it's difficult to study some aspects of medicine in a rigorous way doesn't mean that we shouldn't eliminate the modalities that we know aren't effective \(like homeopathy\).
1.10.4.2. Con: The study states that psychotherapy is partly aided by the placebo effect. This differs from homeopathy, which when it works, only works because of the placebo effect.
1.10.5. Pro: A lack of confidence that public health resources are being used appropriately may lead people to stop supporting government health spending.
1.10.5.1. Con: The UK National Health Service funded homeopathic remedies until 2017, but in that period support for increased funding of the NHS remained as [high as ever](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/16/two-thirds-support-higher-taxes-to-fund-nhs).
1.10.5.2. Pro: Many healthcare systems are already facing a funding [crisis.](http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/266380/The-impact-of-the-financial-crisis-on-the-health-system-and-health-in-Greece.pdf) A further decrease in funding due to the funding of homeopathy could be debilitating to the system.
1.10.6. Pro: Some alternative medicines [do work](https://health.spectator.co.uk/are-all-alternative-therapies-useless-not-quite-here-are-three-that-work/) and these are provided by public healthcare [systems](https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/wider-healthcare-team/roles-wider-healthcare-team/clinical-support-staff/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-cam). If homeopathy, which many believe is ineffective, is provided alongside these treatments it will undermine the public's faith in all these potentially beneficial alternatives.
1.10.6.1. Con: Alternative medicine that has been proved to work gets integrated into real medicine. Like exercise or some beneficial compounds from plants \(like aspirin, opium, or digitalis\).  To say alternative medicine works is to be willfully blind to the evidence.
1.10.6.2. Pro: Yes, some alternative medicines do work better than placebo \(homeopathy is not one of them\), but, as it is referred in the linked article, the very few that work may not be recommended in the PHS. The reasons for this are scientifically sound and varied: side effects, availability etc.
Exclusion of these treatments actually increases trust in the PHS.
Non-conventional/complementary medicine is a preferred term to successful alternative medicine.
1.10.7. Pro: It would also undermine the work of many investigators who proved the effectivity of proper treatments, which are now being compared to unproven claims.
1.10.8. Pro: The homeopathic lobby intentionally uses misinformation \(e.g. scientific sounding words\) to make public officials believe that homeopathy is an effective medicine. Institutions funded by tax payers should not fall for this.
1.10.8.1. Pro: In the absence of any high quality evidence to support its efficacy homeopathy is a belief and personal want rather than a public need, and as such public funding should not be used to pay for personal wants. For example many people believe prayer helps them, and that miracles occur but we don't use public funds to supply prayer books or send people to Lourdes.
