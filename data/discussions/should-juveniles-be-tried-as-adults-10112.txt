Discussion Title: Should juveniles be tried as adults?

1. Juvenile criminals should not be tried as adults.
1.1. Pro: Many juvenile criminals come from broken homes. Trying them as adults can seem like punishing them for learning how to survive in their given environments, which they aren't responsible for.
1.2. Pro: Juvenile criminals often don't fully understand their rights during times of questioning and confessions.
1.3. Pro: When tried as adults, children then can be sentenced as adults, allowing for "life in prison" to be the punishment. Since the role of prison is to rehabilitate, this is ineffective.
1.4. Con: Some juvenile criminals commit violent crimes and could be a hazard to public health if they were released sooner under the juvenile system.
1.5. Con: Many juvenile criminals are old enough to understand the consequences of their actions, just like adults.
1.6. Pro: Juveniles' brains haven't developed enough. It is unfair to try them as adults.
1.6.1. Pro: They may not fully understand the consequences of their actions.
1.6.2. Pro: They may lack the same impulse control that adults possess.
