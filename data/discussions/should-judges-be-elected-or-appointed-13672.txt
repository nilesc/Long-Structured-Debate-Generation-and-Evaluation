Discussion Title: Should Judges be Elected or Appointed?

1. Judges should be appointed rather than elected.
1.1. Con: Allowing the Government to appoint judges erodes the separation of powers.
1.1.1. Pro: Appointment systems exacerbate the effects of corruption within legislatures. Elections can function as an effective check on the damage that corruption within the legislature can have on the judiciary.
1.1.2. Pro: Sitting executives can nominate individuals who will side with them on contentious legal issues.
1.1.2.1. Con: In most appointment systems there is a check on one branch of government's total power to appoint.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Some systems, like the [US federal judiciary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge), have a confirmation process which requires confirmation of nominees by representative bodies.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Executives whose party comes into power with a majority in legislative bodies can easily bypass the scrutiny of a confirmation process.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Many systems select their candidates from a [civil service like](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/world/americas/25iht-judge.4.13194819.html) system of professional applicants.
1.1.3. Con: Lifetime judicial appointments result in a relatively small number of vacancies over the course of a single governments' time in office. This means that individual governments rarely have the chance to significantly change the makeup of the judiciary to the extent that it would meaningfully erode the separation of powers.
1.1.4. Con: Separation of powers is only eroded if there is a tit-for-tat mentality between the appointer and the appointee. The Judiciary, over the vast majority of our \(United States\) history has honorably held themselves completely separate, often ruling against those who appointed them even.
1.1.5. Con: Attempts by the executive or legislature to pack the judiciary through appointments have traditionally [failed](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/when-franklin-roosevelt-clashed-with-the-supreme-court-and-lost-78497994/), as was the case with FDRs Court Packing Plan.
1.1.5.1. Con: Examples of successful court packing can be seen all over the world.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Poland's Law and Justice party has been making [sweeping reforms](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/12/19/polish-ruling-party-passed-unconstitutional-laws-now-controls-constitutional-tribunal-trump-law-justice/) in recent years in order to stack Polish courts through appointments.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: The Polish government [claims](https://www.premier.gov.pl/en/news/news/the-government-presents-a-white-paper-on-the-reforms-of-the-polish-justice-system.html) that these reforms in fact strengthen the judiciary's independence. For example, before these reforms, judges could at times be transferred between departments non-consensually. This is no longer possible. Moreover, they argue that the reforms make it more, not less, difficult for court administrators to impose their will on the judiciary.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: In Venezuela, the supreme court was famously expanded in order to [stack judges](https://www.hrw.org/news/2004/12/13/venezuela-chavez-allies-pack-supreme-court) who were aligned with Hugo Chavez.
1.1.5.1.3. Pro: Fidesz, under Orbán's leadership, has dismantled the autonomy and checking power of the Hungarian constitutional court in a [variety of ways](https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/hungarys-constitutional-revolution/).
1.1.5.1.4. Pro: Argentina's courts have faced many challenges to their independence.
1.1.5.1.4.1. Pro: In the 1990s, newly elected Argentinian president Carlos Menem pushed through one of the [brashest court-packing moves](https://www.economist.com/node/4489704) in recent memory. His Congress added four more seats to the five-member Supreme Court. This, plus the replacement of one of the pre-existing justices, enabled Mr Menem to create a notorious “automatic majority” of mostly legally undistinguished loyalists, who religiously backed his executive initiatives of dubious constitutionality.
1.1.5.1.4.2. Pro: In 2006, then-President Néstor Kirchner [changed](https://www.economist.com/blogs/americasview/2012/12/argentinas-courts) the number of members on the council responsible for judicial nominations, in order to provide the executive branch with veto power. This mechanism allowed him to alter the composition of lower courts in his favor.
1.1.5.1.4.3. Pro: The independence of Argentina's judiciary continues to be dubious. It currently ranks 100th out of 137 countries in judicial independence [\(WEF, 2017\)](http://reports.weforum.org/pdf/gci-2017-2018-scorecard/WEF_GCI_2017_2018_Scorecard_EOSQ144.pdf).
1.1.6. Pro: Separation of powers is a valuable idea within modern democracies because it ensures that no incumbent ruling party accumulates enough power and support that it is answerable to no one.
1.1.6.1. Con: Elections are more likely to allow for the accumulation of power across branches of government, because people are likely to vote for the same parties across branches of government.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Voters [tend](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5b79/65a036f18c5aa3a7fc568236c1923210be88.pdf) to pick judges based on party identification, and they do so whether this identification is displayed on the ballot or not.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Voters are also more likely to pick [unqualified](http://chicagopolicyreview.org/2016/01/29/partisan-judicial-elections-can-lead-to-lower-quality-judges/) candidates in partisan elections.
1.1.6.1.2. Con: This is just as likely to happen in a system where elected officials appoint judges of the same party or political leaning.
1.1.6.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: Political polarization is [increasing](https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/en/topics/aktuelle-meldungen/2018/maerz/democracy-under-pressure-polarization-and-repression-are-increasing-worldwide/) in democracies worldwide, making such outcomes more likely.
1.1.6.1.4. Con: This can be mitigated by limiting the number of judges who are appointed in any particular election.
1.1.6.1.4.1. Pro: Other elected officials such as [Senators](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Direct_Election_Senators.htm) are elected on longer terms with rolling elections, so that only one third of positions are filled in any one election.
1.2. Pro: Voters are likely to make bad decisions when electing judges.
1.2.1. Pro: Voters do not know what characteristics to look for in order to determine which candidates are most qualified.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Even if voters did know what characteristics were important, it is difficult for them to gain access to that information.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The majority of trials are not reported on by newspapers, so if a voter is looking for information on a judge's past case history there is a high potential for their opinion to be biased by one or two high profile cases which that judge has presided upon which were reported.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: In the United States, judges [rarely](https://www.rcfp.org/secret-justice-judicial-speech/working-relationship-between-judges-and-news-media) communicate directly with the press. This norm inhibits the ability for the average voter to get to know a judge in the same manner as one would a typical elected official. Consequently, most people would likely default to voting along party lines without considering judges based on their individual merit or qualifications.
1.2.1.1.3. Pro: There are resources that allow anyone to search for cases that particular judges have presided over, such as [legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com](https://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/westlaw-legal-research/) but this information and technology is not free for the public to access, so most people would not be inclined to use it.
1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Westlaw costs upwards of [$300.00](http://bencarterlaw.com/blog/why-i-will-not-be-renewing-my-westlaw-subscription-in-2016) per month to access.
1.2.1.1.3.2. Con: While services such as Westlaw can provide a convenient way to access legal information, it is not necessary to pay for a service to access court decisions.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Legal documents tend to be written in a form of ["legalese"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legalese) that is not easily understood.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Decisions are often made on the basis of facts and principles that are complex and unintuitive and hence difficult to communicate to the public.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Additional complexity may make the law more fair, but comes at the cost of comprehensibility. Because the legal system suffers when few understand it, it is important to have a mechanism which balances simplicity and fairness. Elections can serve as that mechanism.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The political economy of lawmaking processes presses the law toward greater complexity with little regard to whether any particular complexity is worth its costs, meaning we end up with more complexity in law than we need. Elections can provide a counterbalance to this process. [\(Schuck, p.8\)](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3196&context=dlj)
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: There is value in communicating judgements to the public. More complicated decisions are harder to explain to the public. As such it is often worth trading a fairer but more complex decision for a simpler and easier to explain judgement.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: It is easier for the public to follow laws if they know when they know they are breaking them. Consistent and comprehensible legal decisions facilitate this.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: No matter how clear legal decisions are, the general public will never be able to understand the legal system.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The number of laws that exist in the legal system exceeds the capacity of any one person to know or understand.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: There are over 5000 federal laws in addition to 300 000 criminally enforceable regulations in the [U.S.](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/06/06/how-many-federal-laws-are-there-again-n2009184)
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Many enforceable laws are outdated or victimless and hence hard to predict.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: It is a strict liability federal offense to be in possession of the feathers of the [Bald Eagle](https://www.fws.gov/eaglerepository/factsheets/PossessionOfEagleFeathersFactSheet.pdf). This is despite the fact that the birds are no longer endangered and the feathers are critical t many Native American ceremonies.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Sodomy is still [illegal](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/04/21/12-states-ban-sodomy-a-decade-after-court-ruling/7981025/) in 12 U.S. states.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: [40 625](http://www.searchamelia.com/land-of-40627-laws-and-regulations-more) news laws were created in the U.S. in 2010 alone.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: Gun usage in the U.S. is governed by more than [20 000](https://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/publications/gunbook4.pdf) federal laws.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.5. Pro: U.S. tax law exceeds [7 500](http://www.kowal.com/?q=How-Many-Federal-Laws-Are-There%3F) pages worth of legislation.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Core facets of the legal system are unintuitive and contradictory.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: When the average member of the public understands the basis by which legal decisions are being made it increases their capacity to oversee the judiciary, and the bodies that oversee the judiciary, if it isn't functioning properly.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Voters who have no specialised training or expertise relating to the law cannot be expected to assess the professional competency of someone who does have that training and expertise. Therefore, voters are not in a position to hold elected judges to account.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Voters can access guidance and expert knowledge to inform their vote. They need not themselves be experts in the field to assess an elected judge's performance.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: If the efficacy of using voters as an accountability mechanism is contingent on those voters being informed by experts, it is reasonable to make judges accountable to those experts in the first place.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Understanding the law can help inspire faith in the rule of law which is important to any society.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: The legal system's success rests on its ability to monopolize justice and the use of force in society. If people lose faith in the legal system they will seek alternate methods of resolving disputes.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: When people feel the law cannot protect them they often resort to vigilantism.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: If businesses do not believe the courts are fair they are likely to resort to private arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. Since such mechanisms are decentralized, arbiters need not respect each others decisions, decisions may be inconsistent and contradictory, complicating transactions.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Without any pressure to reduce complexity in the legal system, it is likely that additional complexity which produces outcomes which are either only marginally more fair or no more fair at all will continue to grow. Once Judges become more aware of the trade-off between complexity and comprehensibility in their decisions as a result of elections, these will also be the first decisions to change.
1.2.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: State court decisions can be found in archives like [this](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/) or [this](https://www.law.cornell.edu/states/listing).
1.2.1.1.3.2.3. Pro: Federal Appellate and District decisions can be found on the website of the [Government Publishing Office](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=USCOURTS) and in archives of the [Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/federal/districts).
1.2.1.1.3.2.4. Pro: All U.S. Supreme Court decisions are publish on their [website](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/journal.aspx) or through free [archives](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/journal.aspx).
1.2.1.1.4. Con: The fact that there is a barrier to information on legal issues is all the more reason to have elections where press are forced to scrutinize judges records and convey the highlights of that information to the public.
1.2.1.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.2.2.
1.2.1.1.6. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.2.3.
1.2.1.1.7. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.2.4.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Voters will often make their decision on who to vote for on the basis of candidate's [titles](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-judge-elections-ballot-06012016-snap-story.html).
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: In an election system, there is a very strong motivation for judges to come to particular verdicts in order to make use of particular titles in their campaigns.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Judges have fought hard for the right to [campaign](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-judge-elections-ballot-06012016-snap-story.html) under titles such as "violent crimes prosecutor", "gang homicide prosecutor", "child molestation prosecutor" and "civil 
activist."
1.2.1.3. Con: A [study](http://chicagopolicyreview.org/2016/01/29/partisan-judicial-elections-can-lead-to-lower-quality-judges/), which based their rankings of judges on the Bar Associations of various states in the USA, found that in 94% of cases "qualified" candidates won out over "unqualified" candidates.
1.2.2. Con: We trust people to vote in other circumstances, such as for politicians.
1.2.2.1. Con: Politicians should appoint judges on our behalf. We elect politicians to make complex decisions in a number of fields, such as selecting public health advisors, and police chiefs. Appointing judges is a similarly complex process.
1.2.2.2. Con: In contrast to politicians, judicial candidates are limited in their ability to campaign because of judicial conduct rules which prohibit them from making statements which could damage the perceived impartiality of the judiciary. In the absence of information from the candidates themselves, voters must rely on guidance from outside sources which are likely to be unreliable and biased. [\(Geyh, p. 60\)](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1337&context=facpub)
1.2.2.3. Con: "Politicians" and judges fundamentally differ in their purpose and function in ways which make electing judges fundamentally different from electing politicians.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Politicians are specifically chosen by particular coalitions to bring those coalitions' interests to fruition. Judges represent the greater interest of the people to see the law be applied correctly and fairly, regardless of the interests of those coalitions.
1.2.3. Con: There is no objective standard to determine if a judge is "good" or "bad." Voters should be able to choose anyone they trust to interpret their laws.
1.2.3.1. Con: Minimum standards of education and experience, while not guaranteeing that a judge is "good", seem much more likely to produce "good" judges than popular will.
1.2.3.2. Con: Given that jurisdictions which operate under systems of common law regularly rely upon [precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent) in the arbitration of cases, not understanding the applications of the law in previous cases would make for an objectively bad judge.
1.2.3.3. Con: Even if there is not an objective way to evaluate judges, voters are not in a position to make sure that their preferences are expressed because 80% fail to turnout for elections and of that 80% only 20% can identify the candidates on the ballot. [\(Geyh, p. 3-4\)](http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/oslj/files/2012/03/64.1.geyh_.pdf) Even if voters should be able to choose their judges, the nature of judicial elections makes them unable to effectively use that choice.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: If a choice is made based on information which is not true, or a complete lack of information, it does not constitute a rational or meaningful exercise of freedom of choice.
1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.
1.3. Pro: Judges should be selected for their skills and experience in law, rather than their ability to run an effective election campaign.
1.3.1. Con: Appointed candidates are still subject to measures of political appeal which can outweigh their skills and experience.
1.3.1.1. Pro: The Trump administration has nominated an [unprecedented](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-nominating-unqualified-judges-left-and-right-710263) amount of unqualified judges, presumably for their political appeal.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Only four \(out of 58\) of Trump's judge nominations have been deemed unqualified. This isn't a particularity large number, with George W Bush having seven of his nominations deemed [unqualified](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-nominating-unqualified-judges-left-and-right-710263).
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: President Bush did this over the course of 8 years. President Trump did this quickly into the first year of his first term. This is what makes his appointments [unprecedented](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-nominating-unqualified-judges-left-and-right-710263).
1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Bush's appointment of unqualified judges is another indicator of the political biases that can corrupt appointment systems.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: The rate at which Trump has nominated these unqualified individuals, and the [proportion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/11/10/how-unusual-are-trumps-not-qualified-judicial-nominations/?utm_term=.ca795d59c8ec) of total nominations he has made that are unqualified is notably higher than any previous administration.
1.3.1.1.3. Con: Trump's unqualified appointments are the exception that proves the rule.
1.3.1.2. Con: The effect of political appeal is weaker in an appointment system and often only applicable to high profile appointments.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: Political appeal still matters to the special interests who now have an increased say without as much public scrutiny.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: In the United States, the pro-life movement, through a [coordinated lobbying](https://jimdaly.focusonthefamily.com/president-trump-makes-outstanding-pick-supreme-court/) of the executive, has a disproportionate say in how the appointed judges are selected.
1.3.1.2.1.2. Con: There is less scrutiny on the extent to which special interests can influence elections since the results are seen as "the will of the people."
1.3.1.2.1.2.1. Con: When in a election, special interests must have their contributions to judicial campaigns listed as [public record](https://transition.fec.gov/pages/brochures/fecfeca.shtml). This is much easier for watchdog groups to scrutinize than backdoor meetings with government officials.
1.3.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: In the US, the [Citizens United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC) ruling opened legal loopholes that allow for parallel "Super PACs" to have unlimited expenditures towards political causes \(though not directly towards campaigns\). These groups are very difficult for the public to scrutinize because it is easy for major corporations to obfuscate their contributions to "Super PACs" through [shell companies](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/fundraising/272135-deadlocked-fec-allows-donors-to-hide-behind-shell-companies) and subsidiaries.
1.3.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Most countries do not allow for unlimited contributions through "Super PACs" as the US does.
1.3.1.2.1.2.1.1.2. Con: "Super PACs" must also disclose their donors and how they spend their cash to the FEC. This is still more transparent as it is a matter of public record that watchdogs and average citizens can scrutinize more clearly than the difficult to record lobbying of individuals.
1.3.1.2.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: In 2011, the Mitt Romney-linked Restore our Future super PAC reported a $1 million contribution from “W Spann LLC.” This was an unfamiliar group to the media and the public. After [investigation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-super-pacs/2012/04/13/gIQAGPnEFT_story.html?utm_term=.78ceb8155ad6) it was discovered  that its address in New York was the same as that of Bain Capital Romney’s former firm. It was discovered that this was a shell created for this purpose.
1.3.1.2.1.3. Con: It is harder to get an unqualified candidate appointed than elected, because commissions apply objective tests that elections do not.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: The effect of political appeal on a candidate's appointment is likely to correlate to the media attention such an appointment receives. Local appointments receive significantly less attention than federal appointments.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: [Two thirds of Americans](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/03/two-thirds-of-americans-c_n_599058.html) can't even name one appointed Supreme court justice. Even controversial judges \(especially at lower appointed levels\) receive little media coverage and public attention. By comparison elected judges are known by their constituents because of their campaigns and public statements.
1.3.1.2.3. Pro: Even when political appeal comes into play, the effect is weakened since voters ability to effect appointment decisions is one layer removed by the ballot box.
1.3.1.3. Pro: When commissions are used to appoint candidates, political interests still play a role. Commissions tend to be dominated by lawyers, who have their own set of political and judicial interests. [\(Park, p. 169\)](http://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=conlawnow)
1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.3.3. Con: Introducing a system of minimum requirements, as many jurisdictions have, would solve for this. This means that anybody elected would have adequate skills and experience.
1.3.3.1. Con: Checks and balances do not guarantee all appointments are qualified.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Law is almost infinitely complex, thus simply meeting a minimum standard does not mean they are necessarily sufficiently qualified. Appointed judges can be specifically chosen for certain roles which takes this excess complexity account.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Most jurisdictions appear to set a relatively low bar for judicial elections.
1.3.3.1.3. Pro: Stringent requirements to prevent unqualified candidates from being elected would be counter-productive since they would severely restrict the democratic process.
1.3.3.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.3.3.2. Pro: There should be a public test for Judges with political influence as minimal as possible.
1.3.3.3. Pro: In Ontario you need [10 years membership](https://careertrend.com/how-6218760-become-judge-canada.html) at the bar in Canada in order to be a judge on the lower courts.
1.3.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.
1.3.3.5. Pro: In France judges must undergo a formal application and training process. [In Bordeaux](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/world/americas/25iht-judge.4.13194819.html) prospective \(law degree holding\) judges must pass a four day written test in order to then enter a 27-month training program at the École Nationale de la Magistrature.
1.3.4. Pro: Legislators create the laws; judges determine if the intent of the law is followed or not.  Judges could be appointed \(hired\) and as long as they do their jobs correctly \(follow the intent of the laws\) they can keep their jobs.  If they stop following the intent of the laws, and, instead, make up their own law, then they need to be fired.
1.3.5. Pro: If Judges were elected, it would attract the wrong people for the role. The Judiciary would be as big of a mess as Congress.
1.3.6. Pro: Voters are unlikely to have reliable information on the character or competence of the person for which they are voting. In contrast, commissions can perform in depth investigations into a potential judge's past conduct.
1.3.7. Pro: Qualified candidates may be discouraged from running for a judicial position for fear of the "mud-slinging" and expenses that come with an election campaign.
1.3.7.1. Con: Being a candidate in an election can be an opportunity for qualified judges to make their qualifications well known to the public such that even if they lose they may have better job prospects.
1.3.7.2. Pro: Political scandals and public embarassment can end an individuals career.
1.3.7.2.1. Con: It is good to disincentivize scandal prone individuals from seeking public office.
1.4. Pro: Diversity quotas can, and should, be used when judges are appointed.
1.4.1. Con: Female judges report that the systems by which judicial appointments are made operate like ["old boys clubs"](http://americasquarterly.org/women-in-robes) which can be a barrier to their appointment.
1.4.1.1. Con: Even without quotas appointment systems are [more likely](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1540-6237.00097) to create gender diversity on courts than elected systems.
1.4.2. Pro: It is politically difficult to have a mandate for diversity when judges are elected.
1.4.2.1. Con: Efforts to increase the diversity in elections do exist. For instance, in [Spain](http://eige.europa.eu/gender-mainstreaming/good-practices/spain/electoral-quotas-work), 40% of all candidates on the ballot must be women. There is no reason why this could not be extended to judicial elections.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: If it is known that a minimum number of candidates appearing on the ballot must be women, voters may be skeptical of a woman's ability and believe her to only be there as a result of affirmative action, thus harming her chance of being elected and her legitimacy once elected.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Accusations of affirmative action are more likely under an appointment system, as under a public system the people may exercise choice over the sorts of judges that are chosen to serve. Under an appointment system, the public has no input and would therefore be more likely to assume that the candidate does not merit the office.
1.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: In an appointment system individuals go from having no choice in candidate to no choice in candidate once affirmative action is implemented. In an election system they will go from having total choice over the candidate to having a limited choice \(through reserved seats\). Therefore, affirmative action is more likely to happen in the first place in an appointment system because individuals will notice less of a loss in agency.
1.4.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: While it is true that the implementation of affirmative action in an appointment system has a limited change to voter agency, it implies voter agency is a quality to be maximized. If this is the case an elected system is clearly superior.
1.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Minimizing voter anger and backlash is more important than maximizing voter agency. This is because minimizing anger towards the system contributes the most to societal stability.
1.4.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The fact that individuals care about a loss of agency implies that they value agency. Surely those same individuals would be equally upset by the existence of a system that limited their agency from the start.
1.4.2.2. Con: At least in the US, quotas for appointed office would likely be struck down by the Supreme Court, as has been done in the past. [\(Thomas, pp.1-2\)](http://harvardjlg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016.11.12.Thomas.GenderParity.Final_.pdf)
1.4.2.3. Pro: In order to maintain a quota, some seats would have to be reserved for candidates from whichever background the quota is trying to promote. This would be perceived as discriminatory against those not in that protected background, making Affirmative Action even less likely.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.1.1.1.
1.4.2.4. Con: This problem could be reconciled by imposing diversity quota on candidates prior to their nomination for election. Thus the public will only be able to vote for candidates who already meet diversity requirements.
1.4.2.4.1. Con: Imposing restrictions on who may apply to be elected defeats the purpose of a democratic system by curtailing the freedom of voters to select their own representatives.
1.4.2.4.1.1. Con: This is already done for a variety of categories such as age and birthplace in most states. It is unclear why race and gender are any different.
1.4.3. Pro: Judges from different backgrounds make decisions differently, thus it is important that our judiciary are diversely representative.
1.4.3.1. Pro: There is [some evidence](https://www.jstor.org/stable/42955758?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) that the race of a judge impacts upon their sentencing decisions.
1.4.3.2. Pro: The different experiences of men and women may lead judges to decide [some cases differently](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/us/politics/04women.html). It is therefore important that high courts represent both genders.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Minority judges in the US are less likely than white judges to dismiss civil rights discrimination cases \([pg. 344](http://www.americanbarfoundation.org/uploads/cms/documents/weinberg_nielsen_-_examining_empathy.pdf)\).
1.4.4. Pro: The judiciary of most countries does not represent the gender and ethnicity of the population.
1.4.4.1. Pro: US judges are [predominantly](http://s.org/issues/courts/news/2016/09/15/144287/racial-and-gender-diversity-sorely-lacking-in-americas-courts/) white men.
1.4.4.2. Pro: In the [United Kingdom](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/mar/28/judges-ethnic-sex-diversity-judiciary), only 1 in 20 judges are non-white, and less than 1 in 4 judges are women.
1.5. Con: People have a democratic right to elect their own judges.
1.5.1. Con: People have a democratic right to elect the people who create their laws. The purpose of having the judiciary be separate to the legislature is that those laws are then implemented apolitically. In order for the judiciary to be apolitical, it cannot be democratic.
1.5.1.1. Con: Supreme Courts often end up "creating laws" in the precedents they set in their interpretations of other laws and the Constitution.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: The interpretation of the law by courts can have as large an effect on the way people live their lives as legislatures. People should be able to vote on the sort of legal interpretation which reflects the society they want to live in.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: The rulings of judges in civil courts can have a large impact on the economy of their jurisdiction. Judges who tend to give large punitive damages can discourage businesses from establishing themselves in that jurisdiction. Voters should have an input into a process which affects their employment prospects and the economic outlook of their community.
1.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Alabama Supreme court of the 80's and 90's tended to award high punitive damages. Voters rejected this approach and elected judges who were more conservative in their approach to damages. Since that change, many more multinational businesses including Mercedes, Hyundai and Honda have established plants in the state. [\(Park, p. 173\)](http://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=conlawnow)
1.5.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Given the high impact on local economies that come with judicial decisions, it is especially important that voters do not directly elect judges. This is because voters would be highly motivated to elect biased judges towards job creating large companies.
1.5.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Judges incentivized by the local populations desire for increased economic investment in their community would be more likely to overlook abuses by companies if they bring a lot of jobs and money into the community.
1.5.1.1.1.2. Con: This could lead to situations in which uninformed individuals become the basis for interpreting laws in ways which controvert the original purpose of those laws, possibly curbing or completely destroying that laws benefits.
1.5.1.1.1.3. Pro: "US State courts have interpreted their state constitutions to mandate the recognition of same-sex marriage. Other judicial rulings have overturned legislative tort reform measures such as laws capping the recovery of noneconomic damages on the ground that they violated state constitutions." [\(Park, p. 171\)](http://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=conlawnow)
1.5.2. Pro: People should have a right to participate in the making of institutions which affect their lives. Without any such right, the authority of those institutions is illegitimate because it lacks the consent of the people it affects. Parliaments and executives already follow such this democratic model, the judiciary should be no different.
1.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.1.
1.5.2.2. Pro: The '[consent of the governed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed)' is an integral component of the modern liberal state.
1.5.2.3. Con: By this logic all political appointees such as the Secretary of State or Minister of Finance would be illegitimate.
1.5.2.4. Con: Citizens can vote for the leaders who appoint the judges.
1.5.3. Con: Democratic rights do not simply amount to majoritarian rule, as would be reflected in judicial elections. Rather, they exist to empower individuals and societies to reach mutually beneficial compromises without significantly oppressing minorities in society. Maintaining the independence of the judiciary through an appointment system, therefore allows for the better protection of democratic rights. [\(Bellamy, p.335\)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00344893.2013.830485?needAccess=true)
1.5.4. Con: Democratic rights are a relatively [recent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_democracy) social construction. They have no importance in and of themselves and are only valuable insofar as people care about them or they produce more beneficial outcomes. The [lack](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/world/americas/25iht-judge.4.13194819.html) of public demand for the election of judges \(except in the US\) indicates that for most people, this democratic "right" is unimportant.
1.5.5. Pro: Judges don't just impact the lives of citizens through verdicts on criminal cases; they often have a say in civil matters such as the regulation of zoning, immigration, and the economy.
1.5.5.1. Pro: In the United States, the constitutional framework for how to balance public and private interests in regards to private property is not coherent, and often involves judges making [rulings](https://nsuworks.nova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1505&context=nlr/) on the matter.
1.5.5.2. Con: Elected judges enforcing immigration law are particularly susceptible to populist xenophobia swaying their interpretation of the law.
1.5.5.2.1. Pro: In [many places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_foreigners_to_vote), recent immigrants are not eligible to vote. This gives judges little motivation to rule in their favor.
1.5.5.2.1.1. Con: While individuals currently in the process of immigration cannot vote, former immigrants and individuals in immigrant families feel passionately about immigrant rights.
1.5.5.3. Con: Judges ruling on zoning and trade law are particularly susceptible to lobbying from corporate special interests who would have a strong financial incentive to contribute to their campaigns in order to obtain favorable rulings.
1.6. Con: Appointing judges encourages corruption and cronyism.
1.6.1. Pro: Selection committees often hold a lot of discretion when tasked with choosing the "best" candidate for a job, meaning selectors can get away with using favouritism in their selection process.
1.6.1.1. Pro: This is particularly true for high level judicial appointments where candidates may be of a similarly high caliber and therefore hard to distinguish in terms of years of experience or education.
1.6.2. Pro: Perceived and real corruption in the judiciary not only undermines the courts' credibility in their fight against corruption, but also erodes trust in the courts' impartiality, harming all the core judicial functions. [\(Gloppen, p. 1\)](https://www.cmi.no/publications/file/5091-courts-corruption-and-judicial-independence.pdf)
1.6.3. Pro: In countries where corruption is endemic across all political institutions, attempts by the government to address judicial corruption can both intentionally and unintentionally result in the undermining of judicial independence. [\(Gloppen, p. 69\)](https://www.cmi.no/publications/file/5091-courts-corruption-and-judicial-independence.pdf) In these situations, electing judges can combat corruption by holding judges accountable, without undermining judicial independence to the advantage of other corrupt institutions.
1.6.4. Con: Countries where appointment systems are prone corruption will also be states where [electoral fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud) is widespread. Judicial elections will therefore be subject to corruption and fraud as a result.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Identifying and cracking down on electoral fraud is incredibly difficult. [\(Alvarez, Hall, Hyde, p. 2\)](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/electionfraud_chapter.pdf) In contrast, efforts to combat corruption or cronyism in judicial appointments may be more clear cut.
1.6.5. Pro: Appointment systems can make judges feel as though they owe their position to the particular politician, official, or set of officials that appointed them.  In some countries, judges who abide by the wishes of senior public officials may be rewarded with modern office equipment, higher quality housing or newer cars. [\(p. 39\)](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAWJUSTINST/Resources/Judiciary_Advocacy_ToolKit.pdf)
1.6.6. Con: Best practice [guidelines](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAWJUSTINST/Resources/Judiciary_Advocacy_ToolKit.pdf) exist for the prevention of corruption in the judiciary, including in corruption systems. Objective and transparent processes, clear election criteria and the inclusion of civil society groups can all create the necessary professionalism and integrity to stop judicial corruption.
1.6.6.1. Con: Many governments fall short of "best practices" as is evidenced by many [prominent human rights groups](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2018).
1.6.7. Con: The ability to finance election campaigns gives special interests an undue influence over the judiciary.
1.6.7.1. Con: Special interests can still have a lot of say over the individuals that appoint judges.
1.6.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.1.1.
1.6.7.2. Con: The state can and does offer [public financing](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/public-financing-of-campaigns-overview.aspx) for judicial campaigns to reduce the influence of special interests.
1.6.7.2.1. Pro: A [study](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/elections/judges-elections-finance-campaign) of judges in North Carolina found that judges  became much less favourable towards attorneys who had donated to their campaigns after they began to accept public financing.
1.6.7.2.1.1. Con: The results of the study suggest that donors do in fact have distorting influence on judicial decision making, indicating that even if public financing can mitigate this effect, appointment based systems are an overall superior solution.
1.6.7.2.2. Con: Public financing comes at a cost to the state. Without judicial elections this money could be spent elsewhere.
1.6.7.2.2.1. Con: All elections require a considerable degree of time and money, but democratic representation has its opportunity cost.
1.6.7.2.3. Con: Public financing is [rarely used](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/public-financing-of-campaigns-overview.aspx) in the US as the financial advantages of private fundraising frequently prompt candidates to opt out of public financing programs, which often include expenditure limits for participants.
1.6.7.2.3.1. Con: Public financing is [commonly used](http://prospect.org/article/how-our-campaign-finance-system-compares-other-countries) in many other democracies. The US is not a representative case study.
1.6.7.3. Con: The ability to finance elections provides campaigns with more funds to inform the public.
1.6.7.3.1. Pro: Forcing judges to have to explain their decisions to voters in order to get them to the polls can only serve to bolster civic engagement.
1.6.7.3.1.1. Con: Even though the US has [very high](https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/cost.php) spending on its elections it has relatively [low rates](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/) of voter turn out.
1.6.7.4. Con: This can be solved while still electing judges. Judges should not be allowed to run a campaign using funding from special interest groups. The election of a judge should be based on their skills and experience in the law.
1.6.7.5. Pro: Judges may alter their decisions to avoid angering backers and contributors to campaigns.
1.6.7.5.1. Con: Judges have a strong incentive not to appear biased, as such they are likely to recuse themselves if they fear they cannot be objective.
1.6.7.5.1.1. Pro: Most judges take great pride in their reputations and wouldn't wish to risk tainting that reputation by appearing biased.
1.6.7.5.1.2. Pro: Appearing biased is likely to harm a judges chances of being reelected.
1.6.7.5.1.2.1. Con: It is possible to be biased without appearing biased, just as it is possible to appear biased without being biased.
1.6.7.5.1.2.2. Con: If the judge is biased in favor of the majority of voters, they might not care.
1.6.7.5.1.2.2.1. Con: Appealing to the interests and desires of the majority is a feature, not a flaw, of democratic systems.
1.6.7.5.1.2.2.1.1. Con: The fact that the judiciary accounts for the interests of minorities is a critical part of the separation of powers emphasized by a representative republic.
1.6.7.5.2. Pro: The perception that campaign finance interests may have played a role in the decisions of a court undermines public confidence in the legal system.
1.6.7.5.2.1. Pro: [Polls](http://www.justiceatstake.org/state/state_resources/money-and-elections-resources/) indicate that [most Americans](http://www.justiceatstake.org/issues/state_court_issues/competitive-elections/) believe that campaign donations can give litigants unfair advantages in front of judges.
1.6.7.5.2.2. Pro: This is the case even if financial interests did not play a role in a judge's ultimate decision. As a result, the public may still be suspicious of a judge's ruling even if it was made on legitimate grounds.
1.6.7.5.3. Pro: [Data indicates](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/an-elected-judge-speaks-out-against-judicial-elections/279263/) that the more campaign contributions from business interests justices receive, the more likely they are to vote for business litigants appearing before them in court. A justice who receives half of his or her contributions from business groups would be expected to vote in favor of business interests almost two-thirds of the time.
1.6.7.5.4. Pro: In 2009, then West Virginia Supreme Court Justice [Brent Benjamin](http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/2015/05/are-judicial-elections-good-policy/) ruled in favour of a major backer to his election campaign in a fraud case.
1.6.7.5.4.1. Con: The West Virginia Supreme Court [retried](http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/2015/05/are-judicial-elections-good-policy/) the case, with Justice Benjamin forced to recuse himself for the trial, and the verdict remained the same.
1.6.7.5.4.2. Con: As a result of a  United States Supreme Court ruling on [Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caperton_v._A.T._Massey_Coal_Co.) , judges are now required to recuse themselves from cases where they have an economic interest in the outcome of the trial.
1.6.7.5.5. Con: Legislation can prevent this, such as the [Due Process clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States constitution, which has been interpreted as requiring judges to recuse themselves from cases where they have an economic interest in the outcome of the trial.
1.6.7.5.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.5.4.2.
1.6.7.5.5.2. Con: Even if judges haven't received financial assistance in the past from a party in a case they are adjudicating, their decisions may still be biased as they consider the possibility of future campaign funding or of that party funding a rival candidate.
1.7. Pro: Appointment based systems are less likely to lead to the politicisation of the judiciary.
1.7.1. Pro: Lifetime appointments protect judges from political interference.
1.7.1.1. Con: Lifetime appointments prevent judges from being held accountable for their decisions.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Judges can still be [impeached](http://www.judicialselection.com/judicial_selection/methods/removal_of_judges.cfm?state) for high crimes and misdemeanors.
1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Lifetime appointments mean that even if judges can be removed from office for serious breaches of the law or behavioural impropriety, they cannot be held accountable for a patterns of decisions which while not criminal, are judged to not be ultimately in the best interest of the public. Elections alone can create that sort of accountability.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1. Con: That could/would alter the function and purpose of judges as interpreters of law- they must say what the law is. If that leads to decisions ultimately not in the best interest of the public, but those decisions are still well-reasoned, then fault lies with lawmakers, not the judges themselves.
1.7.1.1.2. Con: Most state judges can be removed from office for [misconduct](http://www.judicialselection.com/judicial_selection/methods/removal_of_judges.cfm?state).
1.7.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.1.1.
1.7.1.2. Con: Life time appointments allow the judges themselves to have a greater political influence, as they can [retire](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/11/lifetime_appointments_don_t_make_sense_anymore.html) when their party is in power.
1.7.1.3. Con: Lifetime appointments also make judges particularly prone to problems with judgement and cognition due to a [variety of factors](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/06/life-tenure-is-too-long-for-supreme-court-justices/304134/) late in their life \(e.g. burnout, decrepitude, health issues\).
1.7.1.4. Pro: Judges should continue to be appointed on merit. And in their judgements they should be allowed to decide without interference, or favoritism including to those who appointed them, in any case.
1.7.1.5. Pro: While political interests may play a role in the appointment of a judge, those interests have no leverage over that judge after they are appointed. This means that they can make decisions which align with their evolving interpretation of the law and the facts of each case which they adjudicate.
1.7.1.5.1. Pro: Despite being appointed by George W. Bush, Chief Justice Roberts of the US Supreme Court has gradually begun to vote in a [more liberal](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-chief-justice-roberts-a-secret-liberal/) manner.
1.7.1.6. Con: Judges who are appointed on a political basis tend to reflect the political values of those [who appoint them](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/01/politics/justice-anthony-kennedy-retirement-rumors/index.html). This is an act of political interference which is likely to be ongoing as judges are unlikely to fundamentally change their legal or political outlook.
1.7.1.6.1. Pro: Politicians have an incentive to nominate the most extreme candidate for judicial positions who shares their ideological positions, so that any [ideological drift](https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/facpubs/1999/) is relatively insignificant. This has the additional harm of creating a judiciary which is politically more extreme than the public at large.
1.7.1.6.2. Pro: Given that the politicians who selected a judge are likely to have left office long ago by the time a judge finishes a lifetime appointment, appointed judges are victims to political interference while failing to be politically representative in the long term.
1.7.2. Con: A [2015 study](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/polarization/politicized-courts-partisan-judges-attorneys-data-analysis) found that evidence for the politicisation of courts in the US is more consistent at a federal level than a state level. Given that most federal judges are appointed and most state judges are elected, this indicates that appointment based systems may result in more politicisation than election based ones.
1.7.2.1. Con: The same study also suggested that the relative conservatism of federal judges may be the result of strategic action by conservatives and Republicans to appoint the most viable candidates toward higher courts where decision-making is more politically important, rather than seeking to have them elected to state courts. Based on the observation that there are far fewer conservative attorneys, the pool of viable candidates is therefore smaller.
1.7.3. Pro: Appointments typically require some level of consensus among politicians or within appointment bodies. This process tends to select more moderate, and therefore less politically charged candidates for judicial office. In contrast, candidates who win elections need only win a plurality of the vote and need not appeal to the remainder of the electorate in any way.
1.7.4. Con: The voting public tends to be sceptical of judges who are perceived as acting politically[\(Peter and Gregory, p. 1\)](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/is-anyone-listening-the-politicization-of-the-judiciary-and-the-loss-ofauthority-an-initial-assessment-2332-0761-1000217.pdf). As a result, judges acting in a excessively political manner will be voted out of office.
1.7.4.1. Pro: In a November 2010 Iowa judicial election, three justices were voted out of office as a result of joining a unanimous ruling that struck down a state statute limiting marriage rights to heterosexual couples.[\(Green, Becker, Ternus, et. al, p. 463\)](http://\(Green, Becker, Ternus, et. al, p. 463\))
1.7.4.2. Con: As long as judges are in line with the political views of the majority acting politically won't be an issue with the electorate.
1.7.5. Pro: Judiciaries which are seen to be overly political may face [attacks](http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/christies_brash_words_on_nj_su.html) on their independence and power. This may undermine systems of checks and balances as well as the long term legitimacy of the judiciary as a whole.
1.7.5.1. Pro: FDR famously combated the Supreme Court, which in his view was acting overly politically by blocking New Deal legislation, by attempting to increase the number of seats and fill them with judges who would vote for his legislation. This was known as the ["Court-Packing"](https://www.fjc.gov/history/timeline/fdrs-court-packing-plan) plan and though it was not passed, there is evidence that it led to increased pressure on the court which began to support New Deal legislation in the wake of the controversy.
1.7.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.7.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.7.6. Con: As of 2017 [over half of the US public](http://www.pollingreport.com/court.htm) thinks that the supreme court \(an appointment system\) is either "too liberal" or "too conservative".
1.7.7. Con: The judiciary is one of three branches of government - there is no reason why politicization of government is a bad thing since it represents the prioritization of majority interests.
1.7.7.1. Con: Even unpopular defendants have the right to a fair trial. If judges fear losing popularity with the majority, they may override those defendants' rights to due process.
1.7.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.5.1.2.2.1.
1.8. Pro: Encouraging judges to run election campaigns is likely to lead to a 'he who has more money wins' result. Few voters would take the time to learn about all candidates. The general public will vote for whomever happens to gain the most exposure through media and campaigns.
1.9. Con: Electing judges inspires people's confidence in the law.
1.9.1. Con: The election of judges may erode people's confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary.
1.9.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.5.2.
1.9.2. Con: Individuals already have many avenues to feel connected to the law.
1.9.2.1. Con: The fact that existing avenues exist, does not mitigate the benefits of additional avenues.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: Perhaps, but the marginal cost of adding those avenues may significantly outweigh any marginal benefit.
1.9.2.2. Pro: Citizens can vote for representatives who create the law.
1.9.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.4.
1.9.3. Pro: This is borne out by findings that elected judges write more opinions which tend to more accessible to the general public than appointed ones. [\(Park, p. 167\)](http://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=conlawnow)
1.9.4. Con: Judicial elections harm an area's [economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/16/why-judges-should-be-appointed-not-elected-commentary.html), by decreasing the confidence of investors in the judicial stability of the region.
1.9.5. Pro: Around [80%](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1337&context=facpub) of the US public prefers to elect judges. This indicates that people see value in the direct input into the judiciary given to them by judicial elections.
1.9.5.1. Con: [80%](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1337&context=facpub) of the US electorate does not vote in judicial elections. This indicates that even if voters have a slight preference for electing judges, it does not matter enough to them to actually turn out.
1.9.6. Con: Judicial systems should strive to gain the confidence of the entire public not just the majority \(or in some cases plurality\) that is required to win elections.
1.9.6.1. Con: While an admirable sentiment, there is no reason to believe that public confidence is more likely to be maximized in an appointment system.
1.9.7. Con: Elections may undermine public confidence in the judicial system as judges are demeaned and attacked throughout partisan campaigns.
1.9.7.1. Pro: The hyperpartisan nature of many democracies means that individuals have a [high level of distrust](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/01/30/why-dont-americans-trust-the-government-because-the-other-party-is-in-power/?utm_term=.c13e0455e2dc) of other parties that could be in power. Given that one party always have to be in power and other parties always have to be left out, this means that many voters will always distrust the elected official in an election system.
1.9.7.2. Pro: More than one out of every three advertisments for US State Supreme Court elections in the period 2015-2016 was negative. [\(Bannon, Lisk and Hardin, p. 33\)](https://www.scribd.com/document/367115732/Who-Pays-for-Judicial-Races-The-Politics-of-Judicial-Elections-2015-16#fullscreen&from_embed)
1.9.7.3. Con: All political candidates who stand for election face criticism and attack. In spite of that, the institutions for which those candidates stand generally maintain public confidence.
1.9.8. Pro: The selection of judges via commission or appointment is highly complex and is perceived as arbitrary. This makes it harder for the public to understand. Instead of this, elections involve the public in a transparent and easily understood manner.
1.10. Pro: Regular judicial elections are a waste of valuable time and money.
1.10.1. Con: Campaign spending limits can minimize this waste of valuable time and money.
1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.4.
1.10.3. Con: -> See 1.6.7.3.1.
1.10.4. Con: -> See 1.6.7.2.2.1.
1.10.5. Pro: Just under $70 million was spent on US state supreme court elections in the period 2015-2016. [\(Bannon, Lisk and Hardin, p.5\)](https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/politics-judicial-elections)
1.10.6. Pro: Elections require judges to spend time campaigning instead of working for the good of the public. This is especially undesirable in light of ongoing [court congestion](http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1960111600) in many countries.
1.10.6.1. Con: Congestion is a reason to elect more judges to the system, not reduce important oversight mechanisms like elections.
1.10.6.1.1. Con: Adding more judges to the system will overwhelm the voter with decisions, allowing for less scrutiny.
1.10.6.2. Con: Appointive systems also take up a significant amount of public servants' time as a result of hearings, interviews and political manoeuvring.
1.10.6.2.1. Con: Appointment systems take up far less time over the long term than election based systems. Election systems typically \(and in the context of this discussion\) have regular terms meaning that judges have to campaign more frequently than they would have to interview.
1.10.6.2.2. Pro: [Merrick Garland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland_Supreme_Court_nomination#Speculation_about_candidates_to_fill_vacancy)'s nomination languished for 293 days before his nomination eventually expired. It is likely this  process diminished his ability to commit to his role as Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
1.10.7. Con: Appointive systems are not free of spending. Approximately $3.7 million was spent to influence the confirmations of Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Samuel Alito for their Supreme Court positions. [\(Goldberg, p. 90\)](https://books.google.ie/books?id=DkIrPWttyDUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false)
1.11. Con: Judicial elections hold judges to account.
1.11.1. Pro: Judges selected by election are more likely to think about the people and communities they are meant to be serving while discharging their duties. In contrast, appointed judges are more likely to consider the views of a [small elite](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/01/22/the-supreme-courts-massive-blind-spot/?utm_term=.4b488c01fc0b) make up commissions and appointment bodies.
1.11.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.3.
1.11.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.2.1.
1.11.3. Con: Turnout in judicial elections is notoriously low. In the United States, typically around 80% of the electorate does not vote. This indicates that the public does not know or care enough about the actions of judges to effectively hold them to account. [\(Geyh, p. 53\)](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1337&context=facpub)
1.11.4. Con: Incumbent candidates for judicial elections rarely lose elections, just [3%](http://chooseyourjudges.org/facts-2/incumbents-in-judicial-elections/) of incumbents in US state supreme court elections lost re-election battles in the period 1986-2006. This indicates that it is difficult to meaningfully hold them to account.
1.11.4.1. Pro: [Around 80%](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1337&context=facpub) of the US public is unable to identify candidates for judicial office. Since most members of the public aren't aware of the existence of these candidates, let alone knowledgeable of how fit candidates on the ballot are to discharge the duties of a judge, they assume that the person who already has the position is capable of doing an adequate job and re-elect them even if this is not the case.
1.11.4.2. Con: The automatic recall elections at least provide a mechanism for the public to hold judges accountable \(even if the public uses that mechanism poorly or rarely\). The other mechanisms put in place for judicial oversight \(review panels, etc.\) are similarly unlikely to ever find fault.
1.11.5. Pro: Judges, who are in [many countries](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/mar/28/judges-ethnic-sex-diversity-judiciary) truly [unrepresentative](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/courts/news/2016/09/15/144287/racial-and-gender-diversity-sorely-lacking-in-americas-courts/) of wider society, can be held to account for prejudicial decision making by elections.
1.11.5.1. Pro: The judge who sentenced rapist [Brock Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_v._Turner) to just six months in prison was [recalled](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/06/voters-recall-judge-in-stanford-campus-sexual-assault-case) after a judicial election. Many attributed his lenient sentencing to Turner's background. It is unlikely that any such accountability for a failure to appropriately sentence such a person would occur in an appointment-based system.
1.11.6. Pro: Without elections, higher courts lack accountability mechanisms.
1.11.6.1. Pro: Federal supreme courts are the highest courts in the judiciary, and as such their decisions cannot be appealed.
1.11.6.2. Pro: State supreme courts often have the final say on issues relating to state constitutions and as such their verdicts cannot be appealed.
1.11.6.3. Pro: This is particularly important because supreme courts often have interpretive power over constitutional matters \([p166](http://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=conlawnow)\).
1.11.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.11.6.3.2. Pro: In the US courts have wide powers in deciding whether or not government actions and laws are [constitutional](https://www.britannica.com/topic/judicial-review).
1.11.6.4. Con: Higher courts could still be held accountable through impeachment provisions involving the elected legislature.
1.11.6.4.1. Pro: In the [US](https://constitutionallawreporter.com/article-03-section-01/impeachment-of-federal-judges/), impeachment of federal judges is roughly outlined as an option in the constitution.
1.11.6.5. Con: Independent investigations and oversight processes, as exist in the [US](https://ballotpedia.org/Judicial_Conduct_and_Disability_Act_of_1980), allow anyone to submit a complaint against judges whose conduct is then investigated. Outcomes of such processes include suspension, public or private reprimands and reccomendation for impeachment.
1.11.7. Pro: The knowledge that a judge may not be elected again if his/her decisions are too unfair or against public opinion makes judges operate in a fashion that is correlated to popular public opinion.
1.11.7.1. Con: The law should operate on fairness and justice, not public opinion.
1.11.7.1.1. Pro: Since public opinions are highly malleable - it is unfair to hold criterias such as fairness and justice subject to short term change. In such situations people will lack clarity what the law is since public opinion changes so radically.
1.11.7.1.1.1. Pro: Many social opinions seen as inalienable now were considered obscene and impossible a few years ago. Similarly, many values held in society thought to be inalienable are seen as inapplicable now.
1.11.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: The system of monarchy was once the dominant one in the world. Many kings derived their right to rule as a result of divine mandate. A king therefore was seen to have had the right to rule. Monarchy is now an outdated system and values that accompanied it are no longer dominant.
1.11.7.1.1.1.2. Pro: The idea of [same-sex](https://www.britannica.com/topic/same-sex-marriage) marriage was seen as something that was an affront to nature and God by most cultures and dominant religions. Now most first world democracies are moving towards legalization of that and have created a new right that was previously seen as non existent.
1.11.7.1.2. Pro: [Brown vs. Board of Education](http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/history-brown-v-board-education-re-enactment) was a landmark case for desegregation within the USA. It was greatly opposed by many people and operating on democratic principles in law may never have let the decision pass.
1.11.7.1.3. Con: Governments, who are the source of the law, should only consider popular opinion, they have no duty to uphold undefined concepts such as fairness.
1.11.7.1.3.1. Pro: All authority of democratic governance stems from the will of the people.
1.11.7.1.3.2. Con: Many democratic nations have the guarantee of human rights enshrined within their constitutions.
1.11.7.1.3.2.1. Con: Popular opinion is usually what enshrined these rights in the first place. It should also be able to revoke them.
1.11.7.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Popular opinion should not be the basis for revoking or destroying human rights.
1.11.7.1.4. Pro: Legal institutions within a country operate on a paternal role that is meant to arbitrate conflict between members of the public. Infringing judicial autonomy by making it subject to public approval will result in decisions that may be gross violations of human rights.
1.11.7.1.4.1. Pro: The holocaust, rampant racism, and slavery have all been considered popular at various points in history.
1.11.7.1.4.2. Pro: If judges are withhold to mass public opinion they will judge laws on the basis of that opinion, this means that laws will not be applied to protect the rights of minorities without the assent of the majority.
1.11.7.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.11.7.1.3.
1.11.7.1.5. Pro: State structures like the Judiciary and Executive exist because the general public is incapable of governing itself without organised systems in place.
1.12. Con: The interpretation of the law should reflect the will of the people.
1.12.1. Con: -> See 1.7.7.1.
1.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.1.
1.12.3. Con: The public are already capable of having a significant impact on the interpretation of the law because it is members of the public who choose to bring cases to court and submit their arguments on those issues. Thereby, they affect which matters of law are considered and the manner in which they are considered.
1.12.3.1. Con: Those who bring legal cases to court tend to be richer and better connected. Allowing this to be the only mechanism by which the public can affect the interpretation of the law gives the already powerful a disproportionate influence over that interpretation. [\(Bellamy, p. 341\)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00344893.2013.830485?needAccess=true)
1.12.3.2. Con: Even though members of the public can have an input into the legal forum of a court, the judiciary alone are empowered to make the final decisions on cases and thereby affect the interpretation of the law.
1.12.3.3. Pro: [Thurgood Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurgood_Marshall) intentionally directed the [NAACP](http://www.naacp.org/)'s resources to [finding and litigating](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-dreier/thurgood-marshall-the-naa_b_7715662.html) cases that highlighted discrimination to change the law
1.12.3.4. Con: Many courts can opt not to hear cases.
1.12.4. Con: -> See 1.11.7.1.4.
1.12.5. Con: -> See 1.11.7.1.
1.13. Pro: Judges are likely to consider the impacts of their verdicts on their electability, which could bias their decision making.
1.13.1. Pro: Political pressure makes judges harsher on criminals.
1.13.1.1. Pro: In the United States, the more frequently television attack ads air during an election, the less likely state supreme court justices are, [on average](https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/how-judicial-elections-impact-criminal-cases), to rule in favor of criminal defendants.
1.13.1.2. Pro: Case studies in Pennsylvania and Washington [indicate](https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/how-judicial-elections-impact-criminal-cases) that trial judges sentence defendants convicted of serious felonies to longer sentences the closer they are to re-election.
1.13.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.1.
1.13.2. Pro: Elections require judges to condense their decisions into simple slogans and sound bites, which discourages them from making nuanced differentiations in their judgements.
1.13.2.1. Con: Making legal decisions understandable and accessible for citizens should be a crucial goal for judges.
1.13.2.1.1. Con: This goal could be emphasized by the [continued legal education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_legal_education) judges are required to undergo, which would not require elections.
1.13.2.1.1.1. Pro: It is easier to implement improved judicial education in appointment commissions which usually value and require experience and education.
1.13.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.
1.13.2.1.3. Con: Legal decisions can be made more consistent and comprehensible through standardising policy such as the [United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Federal_Sentencing_Guidelines) which established a generally binding framework for judges' sentencing decisions.
1.13.2.1.3.1. Con: Allowing policy makers to control sentencing can manifest in prejudicial sentencing procedures against vulnerable groups. For instance, possession thresholds for crack possession sentencing are 18 times lower than for cocaine possession, which means crack users who are [more likely](http://www.vocativ.com/underworld/drugs/crack-vs-coke-sentencing/index.html) to be black, low income and less educated, are unfairly targeted and punished.
1.13.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.
1.13.2.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.2.
1.13.2.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.3.
1.13.2.2. Pro: Accounting for the overlapping authorities and procedures of the court itself, along with independent arbitrators, agencies and regulatory bodies are a major source of complexity in civil law in particular. [\(Schuck, p. 10\)](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3196&context=dlj) It would be wrong for judges to ignore these factors in the name of simplicity, as it would damage the integrity and legitimacy of these useful institutions.
1.13.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.
1.13.3. Con: -> See 1.6.7.5.1.2.
1.13.4. Con: In the United States judges are bound by a [code of conduct](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/code-conduct-united-states-judges#d) that forbids them from considering public opinion.
1.13.4.1. Con: If judges are bound not to consider public opinion, then forcing public opinion into their considerations during an election controverts the intent of the code.
1.13.4.2. Pro: Such a code discourages disruptive political or social changes, leading to a more steady and consistent regime.
1.13.5. Pro: [Research](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2013/02/22/researchers-find-appointed-justices-outperform-elected-counterparts) found that appointed judges are more willing to change their preconceived ideas about cases than elected judges, implying that the former is more concerned with delivering justice while the latter is more afraid of losing votes in the next election cycle
1.13.6. Pro: A [study](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532440014550409) of gay rights cases in American states from 1981 to 2004 provides evidence that elected judges were significantly more likely to be affected by public opinion in their rulings. In this instance, that led to a reduced likelihood of  judges voting to protect minority rights.
1.13.6.1. Con: Only a small group of people get to appoint judges, thus appointed judges are more swayed by the opinion of individual people than elected judges.
1.13.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.13.8. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.
