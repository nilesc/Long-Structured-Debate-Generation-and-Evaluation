Discussion Title: Is pedophilia a sexual orientation?

1. Pedophilia is a sexual orientation
1.1. Con: Pedophilia is better described as mental disorder.
1.1.1. Pro: The [American Psychiatric Association](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/explaining-pedophilia#1) has included pedophilia in its as mental disorder since 1968.
1.1.1.1. Con: APA classifications are not particular stable over the long term.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Homosexuality was classified as mental disorder by the APA earlier.
1.1.1.2. Con: Homosexuality was considered a disorder
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Many disorders have been reclassified over the years. There are different boxes than "sexual orientation" where you can put them.
1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.2. Pro: Pedophiles are, quite like gay people, born that way and they are in no control over their feelings.
1.2.1. Pro: Some individuals are born with a predisposition to finding younger/underage faces [more attractive](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/5/20140200.full?sid=aa702674-974f-4505-850a-d44dd4ef5a16).
1.2.2. Pro: Psychologists have come out with studies and evidence to support the idea of paedophilia being a [sexual orientation](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/paedophilia-sexual-orientation-straight-gay-criminal-psychologist-child-sex-abuse-a6965956.html).
1.2.3. Con: There is a strong correlation between victims of sexual abuse and perpetrators, especially in men which suggests that people are not 'born with it' [Link to study showing correlation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11731348)
1.2.4. Pro: Gay people were also considerered sick [until the 70s.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/40459213)
1.3. Con: Pedophiles sexual desire is impossible to realize because a child can't consent.
1.3.1. Con: Sexual orientation is based on what arouses and individual and thus it does not consider how the object of attraction of said individual reacts.
1.3.2. Con: "Ability to realize" is not a requirement of sexual orientation.
1.4. Pro: Historiographically speaking, [child marriages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage) and sexual activity with what are now classed 'minors' were normal. The social aversion to, and horror at, paedophilia is relatively recent.
1.4.1. Con: Historical acceptance doesn't necessarily justify actions, since as time progresses, new discoveries are made
1.4.2. Pro: Humans are fertile as early as  [10-12 for women, and 11-12 for men](http://10-12 for women, and 11-12 for men), so evolutionary speaking, from that age on they were intended to mate.
1.4.2.1. Con: At that age, consent is impossible because of lack of knowledge on what intercourse means, and can result in.
1.4.2.2. Con: Children of that age are [rarely able](https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/themes/health/) to safely carry a child; girls are at far higher risk of miscarriage, death in childbirth and/or pregnancy-related injuries.
1.4.2.3. Con: Biologically speaking, you can have a child at the age of 10, but ethically speaking, you can't have a child at the age of 10 because you are not ready to raise him/her.
1.4.3. Pro: [Worldwide](https://www.ageofconsent.net/highest-and-lowest), age of consent goes as low as 11 \(generally in line with puberty\); it isn't just a historical precedent, but a global precedent.
1.4.4. Con: The fact that it has been an accepted practice doesn't make pedophilia a sexual orientation.
1.4.5. Con: Paedophilia is attraction to pre pubescent children. Attraction to children in early puberty \(which biologically speaking can be from about 8 years onwards in girls\) is hebephilia. Most historical customs of sexual activity involved this second group wherein despite age physical sexual characteristics were present
1.5. Con: The term sexual orientation is defined in the context of [sex and gender​](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/sexual-orientation), not age, hair colour or toe size.
1.5.1. Con: Terms are subjective to change in face of progress
1.5.1.1. Con: Indeed, however changing the definition of sexual orientation to "whatever arouses the person" does not serve any purpouse except creating utter chaos. There are dozens of paraphilia that would love to leech onto the success of LGBT+ movement like this.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Prior to the legality and acceptance of LGBTQ+ orientations, sexuality had a different definition \(ie, referred exclusively to heterosexual sexual attraction\). It is more than possible that other aspects of sexual attraction, especially those considered sexually deviant, might eventually be integrated into the formal dictionary definition.
1.5.2. Con: Sexual orientation is defined by the condition of the human - so a human can be male or female, child, adult - possibly geriatric \(as sexual attraction to someone much older rarely if ever contravenes human social constructs it is not seen as problem or looked at in isolation\)
1.6. Con: There are people atracted to many odd things. By making paedophilia a sexual orientation, one could also argue for zoophilia, necrophilia and other [sexual deviations](https://ce4less.com/Tests/Materials/E083RMaterials.pdf) to be acknowledged as sexual orientations.
1.6.1. Con: By not making pedophilia an orientation, one could argue bisexuality and homosexuality are not orientations.
1.6.1.1. Con: If bisexuality and homosexuality are not sexual orientations, the term loses its meaning, since the only one remaining will be heterosexuality.
1.6.2. Con: Rarity of an attraction should not impact whether it is an orientation
1.6.2.1. Con: Rarity is not the issue here. Paedophilia is an attraction and obsession with prepubescent children. Sexual orientation goes beyond simple attraction, it is above all a key to choosing life partners.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: Paedophilia can be a way of selecting life partners; it is not acceptable, but nonetheless can be a consideration for somebody with paedophilic urges.
1.6.3. Pro: This is entirely true, and not problematic. The question is not whether these things become more acceptable, or legalised: it is how one approaches and addresses them. If acknowledged as orientations, treatment options \(and efficacy\) may increase and stigma might decrease, which can only be beneficial to society.
1.6.3.1. Con: Pedophilia is "incurable".
1.6.3.1.1. Con: This doesn't necessarily mean it's a sexual orientation.
1.6.3.1.1.1. Con: It kinda does. Sexual orientation is something that is generally life long. Being sexually attracted to children even if you don't want to be, is a sexual orientation.
1.6.4. Con: They ARE sexual orientations. Just socially deviant ones.
1.7. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.1.
1.8. Con: Being a child is not a sex, nor a gender; therefore, paedophilia is not a sexual orientation.
1.9. Pro: Some forms of pedophilia are, like homosexuality, strictly evolutionarily speaking unnatural.
1.9.1. Pro: there are numerous observations of free living animals having sex involving juveniles. in an evolutionary sense apparently inefficient behaviour is part of nature. [Wikipedia - sexual behaviour in animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-reproductive_sexual_behavior_in_animals#Sex_involving_juveniles)
1.9.2. Con: There is some evidence that homosexual tendancies do have evolutionary advantages - the "kin selection hypothesis" [medicalxpress.com](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2010-02-reveals-potential-evolutionary-role-same-sex.html)
1.10. Pro: Pedophiles seek acceptance and understanding because of their "condition", just like gay people did before.
1.10.1. Pro: Given there exists an online community of pedophiles there seems to be an urge to find identity and support in the community.
1.10.2. Con: The key difference is gay people were discriminated by religious or unfounded reasons. Pedophiles are not accepted since if they act on their desires they commit statutory rape.
1.10.2.1. Con: Most pedophiles do not commit any crimes, and such generalization contributes to their lack of social acceptance
1.10.2.1.1. Con: The issue is not if they commit crimes or not - and many do not. The question is that if they carry out their sexual desire, they indeed harm someone. Unlike gay people, that, by having sex with a consenting adult from the same sex, do not harm anyone.
1.10.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.10.2.1.2. Pro: Indeed, there are [biological/neurological differences](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/paedophile-brains-difference-child-sex-abusers-those-who-dont-study-a7378911.html) between offending and non-offending paedophiles.
1.10.2.2. Pro: Germany is the first country to address this properly, running [peremptory therapy](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/16/how-germany-treats-paedophiles-before-they-offend) for paedophiles who fear they are at risk of offending, without being judged. If this could be normalised globally, paedophiles could seek help without discrimination.
1.10.2.2.1. Pro: This has been shown to be highly beneficial. Just as an addict can learn to manage their urges, so can a paedophile.
1.10.2.3. Con: Previously, those who acted upon gay urges would be committing buggery, which was [illegal until 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buggery) in the UK and is still illegal in many places worldwide.
1.10.3. Pro: Pedophiles are shunned just like gay people were before.
1.10.4. Pro: Just like some gay people, pedophiles hate themselves for that what they are, and "live in a closet"
