Discussion Title: Is taxation theft?

1. Taxation is theft
1.1. Con: What is theft is itself defined by the legal system. Taxation, like many other actions of the government are performed by institutions rather than individuals so \(even if those acts are wrong\) it makes no sense to classify as a crime because there is no individual culprit, benefactor, or victim.
1.1.1. Pro: Nations are not people. Theft is only a crime within the construct of society and the state. The state itself is not an entity which can be said to thieve.
1.1.1.1. Con: The state itself may not be, as the state is an abstract idea. But an individual who acts on behalf of the state, may violate the rights of other individuals. E.g. The police officer who comes to arrest you for tax evasion.
1.1.2. Pro: While individual members of a government can be prosecuted for crimes, actions performed by the institution of the government itself cannot be prosecuted as crimes but instead only as civil violations.
1.1.2.1. Con: Whether an action should legally be classified as a crime or civil violation has no impact on whether an action should be morally defined as a crime.
1.1.3. Con: Making murder legal and calling it war doesn't make murder right, just like making theft legal and calling it taxation doesn't make it right. On top of that, making something legal only for a few politicians is wrong. And voting doesn't give anyone the right to murder or steal. How does one delegate a right they don't have?
1.1.3.1. Con: War can be just. A justly declared and prosecuted war does make intentional homicide right.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: "A justly declared \(by whom?\) war does make intentional homicide \(against who?\) right." That does not connect at all. See: a bunch of bureaucrats declare war, and citizens - in particular, those who don't agree with such war - from both countries die, how can that be right? I have nothing to do with some bureaucrat I don't even know and/or couldn't care less.
1.1.3.2. Con: Politicians pay tax, too - they do not have any sort of special exemption.
1.1.4. Pro: The concept of property is not recognized by nature beyond the objects which one physically possesses in the moment. Thus, absent of a higher authority, appropriation of an object, even with the use of force, cannot be theft. Theft cannot be defined as something against the will of society; it can only cover the appropriation of an individual's property by another individual of the same society. Thus, society itself cannot possibly perpetrate theft.
1.1.4.1. Con: Taxation does not and cannot exist outside of [property rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_property), because they are natural rights which exist in the absence of any government. [Natural law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law) dictates that no individual shall be deprived of their life, liberty, or property. Taxation is the theft of one's property.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: There's historically been debate over what "property" means. Humans used to be seen as property, for example. One can debate viable ownership and rules to govern it without violating the concept. Belief in property rights doesn't necessitate a belief in an unfettered acquisition and hoarding of wealth, nor submission to all claims of ownership. We don't need to give a billionaire's wealth, obtained from exploitation, the same legitimacy of an indigenous culture's claim to their ancestral home.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: "A declaration of ownership, even if certified by some authority \[IRS\], doesn't mean it is just". Through taxation, the state is asserting [ownership](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership) of wealth, without consent of those who earned it through consensual trade and labor.
1.1.4.1.1.2. Con: This depends on your definition of exploitation. It could be said that the workers are exploiting the employer for their money, and the employer is exploiting the workers for their labor. As long as both parties agree to the arrangement and the terms do not change without renegotiation, no wrongdoing has occurred. Property rights apply equally to all people of all statuses. Any rightful owner's claim to their own property is just as valid as the next person's is to theirs.
1.1.4.1.1.3. Con: Just as societal opinions have changed about humans as property, it stands to reason that opinions could change about the "morality" of taxation.
1.1.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: Segregation of blacks and whites was the "societal rule" for many years, but this does not make the act moral or just. It was civil disobedience \(a la carte rule following\) which brought about societal change for the better.
1.1.4.1.1.4. Con: Property rights begin with the natural right of [self-ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ownership). Since you own your body, you own your actions - including those that create or improve resources, therefore you own your labor and the fruits thereof. If you [cultivate a garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_property#Enclosure_vs_mixing_labor), the crop yield is yours to consume, sell, or dispose of as you see fit. The state claims a percentage of your income, and thereby a right to your labor, which is a product of your body. In this respect, human beings are seen as property of the state.
1.1.4.1.1.4.1. Con: This argument speaks of goods, but not of the land they come from. The land which no one created and which, quite possibly, may need to be fenced off from all other's use and have obedience to such an edict enforced by violence or threat of it. Few would challenge the notion of [personal property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_property). The more difficult aspect of private property to defend was sidestepped for an exclusive defense of a very specific form of personal property that is virtually uncontested.
1.1.4.1.1.4.1.1. Con: If you put your own labor into cultivating your land, it becomes your property and you have the right to defend it against trespass with force if necessary. You are not obligated to allow anyone into your house if you do not wish them to be there.
1.1.4.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Property can be acquired through the act of [Adverse Possession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_possession) \(or squatter's rights\). In certain circumstances, if a legally owned plot of land is openly and continuously occupied by someone else who [changes/improves the land](https://www.beliveaulaw.net/2011/04/someone-else-might-own-your-land-if-they-use-it-long-enough/) and they remain unchallenged for many years, the "squatter" can make a legal claim to ownership.
1.1.4.1.1.4.2. Pro: From the link: "Another view holds that labor is alienable because it can be contracted out... \[The\] choice of a person to voluntarily sell oneself into slavery is also preserved by the principle of self-ownership." The likely strongest argument against humans being property is that they cannot sell themselves into slavery, but some ideologies do violate the moral belief that one can't.
1.1.4.1.1.4.2.1. Con: They key is that labor \(and even your body\) can be [contracted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract#Offer_and_acceptance). Since you own your body and your labor, you can do what you wish with them. Property owners can negotiate to transfer property rights to anyone \(who agrees\) for any price \(which they agree upon\). One could sell themselves in a situation which looks like "slavery" but only if the agreement was not forced. \(e.g. I agree to work 24/7 & be tortured by someone who guarantees my family will have everything they want for life\)
1.1.4.1.1.4.3. Con: This argument is flawed in the respect that while, yes, you may grow the produce through your efforts and labour, the land you grew the produce on ultimately belongs to the state. Thus based on this, the state would own a portion of your produce \(as you could not produce it without their land\). This is the basis of the income tax, which derived from feudal taxes which were a percentage of EVERYTHING produced and made \(often a 1/10th share\).
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.1. Con: This statement makes the assumption that the state owns private property \(real estate\). If the owner of a deed wishes to transfer ownership to another private entity, no third party \(e.g. the state\) has a claim on that transaction.
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2. Con: This makes the claim that the state is entitled to 100% of everything produced by all citizens. If the state owns all land and has a rightful claim to the labor of citizens, then it should not be limited to 1/10th of produced wealth. This implies that our labor is not our own, and belongs to someone else; essentially meaning that we are slaves to the state.
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1. Pro: A 100% income tax rate \(all [earned](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/earn) [income](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/income) from all citizens is confiscated by the state\) would clearly be [theft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft). A 0% tax rate is clearly not theft. Therefore, any level of taxation above 0% is a gradation of theft.
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: A parent having 100% control over their offspring's life would inarguably be slavery. A parent having 0% control over their offspring's life would inarguably not be slavery. Therefore any parent exercising any control over their offspring at any point in their life is a gradation into slavery. Or perhaps both cases are more complex than these reductive analyses?
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The state-citizen relationship is not analogous to parent-child. Parents do not steal money or labor from children. Children rely on their parents up until they are 18 for money, food, clothing, healthcare and a substantial amount of other things. If anything, parents are slaves to their children for 18 years. Although the state does act like an [abusive father](https://www.aclu.org/other/top-ten-abuses-power-911) or a [big brother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance) at times, the government does not fill the same role as family.
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The private economy of capitalism, which requires capital to have true liberty, certainly does force people more generally, but especially children to be in positions far more vulnerable to abuse since they generally must rely on adults to have shelter, food, and healthcare.
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: True [liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty) does not require capital for all people. Liberty is "the responsible use of freedom under the rule of law without depriving anyone else of their freedom". If your version of exercising liberty does involve capital, then you must obtain it without depriving someone else of their capital against their consent. Initiation of force should not be done by any individual against another.
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: From the link: "In politics, liberty consists of the social, political, and economic freedoms to which all community members are entitled." Access to food, shelter, and healthcare, widely considered to be key aspects of human rights, does require capital in a private economy. Liberty is unachievable in deregulated capitalism without sufficient capital.
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The burden of responsibility for one's well being ultimately lies with the individual. You are not owed or entitled outside help by default. If help is granted, it should be done so voluntarily - whether it is begrudgingly or whole-heartedly. "Charity" which arises out of the threat of force \(i.e. not voluntary\) is not [charity](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/charity) at all.
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This is one belief of how society should operate. Many ideologies, and both major political parties in the US disagree with that interpretation.
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Any ideologies which rely on force, coercion, or theft to achieve their goals are immoral. If an idea is good, it will be adopted and spread willingly.
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: It's not capitalism, but nature itself which forces children to be reliant on parents. It is also nature which forces everyone to be vulnerable and reliant on having food, water, shelter. "Capitalism" is not the cause of human needs.
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: The intent was not to create a perfectly analogous situation, but show how the line of reasoning conveniently avoids wrestling with any of the specifics of the topic in question. It's not a proof that taxation is theft, it's attempting to circumvent the details entirely.
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.1.2. Con: The parent of a newborn, obviously has 100% control over their offspring's life. And usually exercises that control too. Gloves to keep the newborn from scratching anything or sticking their finger in anything. The parent decides when and what to feed the child. How to clothe the child, etc. You would have a hard time convincing anyone that's slavery. The premise of a 100% tax being theft is much more convincing. You have a false equivalency attempting to create a straw man.
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.2. Con: Income tax is an evolution of the ancient Feudal System, which came about following the heavy taxation towards the end of the late Roman Empire \(showing taxation has existed for over 2000 years even in ancient civilisations\) and following the collapse of the Roman Empire.
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Depending on which version of Feudalism you accept \(Romantic/Chivalric feudalism vs Realistic\) Taxation under feudalism existed for one of two reasons that ultimately come down to protection and ownership, respectively. Both of these arguments can still be made in the modern era.
1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.2.2. Con: Theft has occurred for millennia. The existence of taxation in ancient empires does nothing to prove it is not theft.
1.1.5. Con: Following the logic that actions by institutions where there is no individual culprit, benefactor or victim should not be classified as a crime would also mean that genocide or war crimes \(including but not limited to: use of chemical or biological weapons\) should not be classified as crimes.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Military and political leaders of institutions who are found guilty of genocide or war crimes are prosecuted and convicted, even though they might not have pulled a single trigger, tortured anyone or dropped a single bomb themselves.
1.1.6. Con: Taxation pays for the enforcement system of [compulsory payments](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/irs-budget-and-workforce), as well as [public relations](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-17-711?source=ra), [regulatory bureaucracies](https://www.businessinsider.com/ridiculous-regulations-big-government-2010-11#10-additional-1099s-to-file-10)/licensing \(fees & fines\), etc. In other words, the system of theft pays for the system of theft.
1.1.7. Con: There are indeed individual benefactors and victims of taxation. The base salary of a US Senator is [$174,000](http://Salaries_of_members_of_the_United_States_Congress). The average household pays [more in taxes](https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/bls-americans-spent-more-taxes-food-clothing-combined-2017) than food and clothing combined.
1.1.8. Con: Just because something is legal doesn't mean it is just or moral. A perfect example of something else that was legal yet immoral would be slavery.
1.1.8.1. Pro: While slavery was deeply immoral it was nevertheless not a crime at the time it was widely practiced. In a similar manner, even if taxation is immoral that does not make it an act of theft.
1.2. Pro: Taxation is theft because for many citizens it is collected without their consent and thus violates their property rights.
1.2.1. Pro: Without consent, any transaction is theft. Without consent, taxation is just a protection racket by the state.
1.2.1.1. Con: The first "consent" is to accept a majority-rules society with agreed-upon vehicles for regulation. One then consents to further regulation if it's correctly adopted. Thus, taxes cannot be immoral or wrong if they're freely agreed upon according to the rules. A lack of consent does not always indicate a crime, but no act in a democratic society can be called a crime without consent. That is, taxes aren't theft unless we consent to calling it theft.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: While some may consent to a majority opinion, it is possible \(and likely\) that 49.99% of the population does not. These minority voters have the same rights as the majority, and it is unjust to deprive them of their life, liberty or property in any manner. Lynch mobs operate democratically \(majority opinion rules\), but this does not make them moral.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Support for a generally democratic system of governance doesn't mean one needs to throw out all regards for life and liberty. Belief in democracy doesn't require a belief that every individual's life is now a single vote away from being taken. Mob rule isn't democracy, it is the breakdown of civil society.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The system being described above is a [constitutional republic](https://www.diffen.com/difference/Democracy_vs_Republic), not a pure democracy. Democracy is majority rule.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This seems pedantic and reductive. Those arguing in favor of democracy are likely not referring to "pure democracy," and it's such a drastically different system than our own that it seems a poor decision to project onto it the ills rampant in capitalist politics and the sensationalist capitalist press.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It is not pedantic - the difference lies at the core of many arguments for taxation. The claim is that taxation is moral because "many people believe it to be true", but this is simply [tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority) over the minority. A constitutional republic is designed to protect the rights of individuals, regardless of popular opinion.
1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: It is not "likely" that every vote will be decided by a .01% majority.
1.2.1.2. Con: Authoritative definitions of theft and stealing specify that the act is "felonious" or "without legal right".  So, a lack of consent is not the sole condition that establishes the definition of theft.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Taxation is legalized theft in the same way that wars are legalized murder.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: From the state's point of view, illegal acts are only what it declares as such. But from a moral point of view, it is hard to come up with better definition for theft than that of consent. The state wants what is illegal to be considered immoral, but legislation is \(in the ideal case\) only a reflection of morality.
1.2.1.3. Con: Governments act in the best interest of their people.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: Human history is riddled with despotic governments. It is inevitable that every government, even democratic ones, will only serve themselves and not society.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Many governments have committed atrocities against their own citizens or others, such as Nazi Germany.
1.2.2. Con: If someone doesn't pay for the car they purchased, the car dealer can sue and force them to pay through legal action. This doesn't make the wealth unjustly acquired.
1.2.2.1. Con: In buying the car, one consents to paying for the purchase. In the case of taxation, one is forced to consume a monopoly good that one neither asked for nor necessarily wants. This is similar to the "protection money" paid to the mob.
1.2.3. Con: Hidden in this argument is the premise that a private individual can make judicious use of all the technological advances, infrastructure and human connections made available through a society. Thus they may derive from these a pre-tax profit that solely belongs to them despite the severe dependencies on socialized institutions. While such a belief may be common, even among those who don't believe taxation is theft, it is fallacious.
1.2.3.1. Con: This same argument was used by the [church in the 18th century](http://voluntaryist.com/backissues/130.pdf); "...many people believed that they needed to pay a tax for the general support of religion - for the same reasons they paid taxes to maintain the roads or the courts. It was simply inconceivable to many of them that society could long exist without state support of religion". Eventually the church realized this stance was immoral, and payments to the church became voluntary. We can apply this same idea to the state.
1.2.3.2. Con: If an individual wishes to benefit from a given technology \(e.g. iPhone, electricity, automobile, rocket ship, etc.\), they must engage in a mutual trade with the owner or provider of that technology. They should not be forced to use a service they do not wish to use, nor should they benefit from a service or product without compensating the owner.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: This argument begins downstream of many pertinent questions. Is the ownership of the technology legitimate, or has an authoritative regime declared someone the owner? How did the technology come into being? If through socialized investment, has the public maintained a say in the technology's development and been given a share of the profits? Were new innovations made in an environment where its contributors were given full liberty, or was it restricted under anti-democratic corporate structures?
1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: For the sake of argument, if I invent an anti-gravity device in my garage using materials which I earned by trading my labor \(nothing stolen and no investors\), it is clear that I would be considered the owner of that technology. I should then be able to sell the device for any price I desire, and any purchaser would benefit from the advancement. The state claims a percentage of every transaction through sales tax on the buyer, as well as ownership of my income as profit. This is wrong.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1. Con: If a hermit born in isolation who never enjoyed interaction with an advanced society, was not helped by inventions born of state investment and market intervention—computers and the internet—made such an invention, then up until the first sale of the item, it may make sense to say that they owned it entirely. But when one is raised in an advanced and interconnected society where the results of social spending are complexly woven into everything, it doesn't make sense to speak in such terms.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: A [sale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales) [transfers](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/transfer) [property](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property) from one [owner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership) to another according to a [mutually](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mutual) [negotiated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/negotiate) [contract](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract). E.g. If you purchase an iPhone from Apple, the contract and terms of service are between you and Apple - "society" is not a [party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_\(law\)) to the [transaction](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/transaction).
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Apple has decades of public subsidies and socialized investment and state, tax funded market interventions to thank for the fact that the foundations of the technology it profits from exists. The fact that the taxpayers responsible never relinquished control over their invested property-nor were ever given their due- in the way condescendingly described here puts us in a very morally gray area, where privatizion is an unavoidable massive theft. As it typically is.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Apple's government subsidies prove that taxation is theft. The iPhone currently maintains a [~43.5% market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/236550/percentage-of-us-population-that-own-a-iphone-smartphone/) of all smartphones which are sold in the US. That means that the majority of smartphone users \(in addition to all non-smartphone users\) are paying for a product which they do not use. If even one person is forced/compelled/extorted to pay for a service which benefits all of society, it is still unjust. Socialized investment should be [voluntary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/voluntary); not compelled.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Living in an advanced, interconnected, and complex society does not change the meaning of "property", "ownership", "permission", or "theft".
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: This is a list of a bunch of words whose definitions are all debated by various ideologies. This is the essence of the argument.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: [Property](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/property) is that which a person owns.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: [Ownership](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/ownership) is the legal right of possession.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.3. Con: [Permission](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/permission) is authorization granted to do something; formal consent.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.4. Con: [Theft](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/theft) is the act of stealing; the wrongful taking and carrying away of the personal goods or property of another; larceny.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5. Pro: Theft, like in the US which occurred through the genocide of Native Americans, is how the US was formed and began the process of privatization. The foundation and expansion of private property is predicated on theft.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.1. Pro: Governmental claims of property via means of force is theft. This bolsters the argument that taxation is theft.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: At the expense of destroying the moral premise of privatization and therefore existing capitalism, yes it does.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.2. Con: Some ideologies believe in the uninhibited and unlimited capability to hoard property and wealth. Others believe in keeping only what one can personally utilize. Different definitions of viable ownership.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.4. Con: Theft is not [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft) as compliance backed by violence and threat of force. A parent taking away a kid's Xbox \(forcing compliance with potential force\) is not 'stealing'. A cop confiscating illicit material \(forced compliance\) is not stealing. We cannot say taxes are theft because it is 'forced compliance' as we allow too many similar situations without calling them 'theft'.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.4.1. Con: The definition linked to states that "theft is the taking of another person's property or services without that person's permission or consent with the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it". The government-citizen relationship is not analogous to parent-child. In this example, the parent in all likelihood bought the Xbox and pays for the electricity it uses - thereby owning it. The implication is that the government has a pre-existing claim to some percentage of people's labor/time/effort.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.5. Con: NASA is taking steps to [privatize](https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/03/nasa-open-to-endorsements-and-naming-rights/). [SpaceX](https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/03/nasa-open-to-endorsements-and-naming-rights/) is a private company with ambitions to push the frontier of space explorations to Mars and beyond. Society will benefit from the technologies necessary to reach these feats \(reusable rocket frames, new propulsion systems, etc\). I'm aware of government subsidies provided to SpaceX, but this could be considered [crony capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crony_capitalism) \(the state intervening to favor one business over another\). In principle, privatization saves society money.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.6. Con: The existence of private property does not follow theft. If property is stolen, the rightful owner still retains a [legal claim](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/claim) to the property, and the thief does not. In the case of Native Americans - some land was stolen by colonists, some was traded/purchased, and some was unoccupied. Wherever a rightful claim to land can be proven, the original owner \(or legal heir\) should be [compensated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Land_Claims_Settlements).
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.6.1. Con: Begging the question. This utilizes the legal system of the society carrying out the atrocities to justify itself and ensure its continued reign.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7. Con: Taxation is a payment for services \(roads, water, sewage, schools, hospitals, police, the arts, military protection, etc\). Value flows both ways \(a transaction\) rather than one way \(theft\).
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.1. Pro: Citizenry is a service of the government to the person. That service requires payment, as stated by the servicer.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.3. Con: When somebody steals $100 from you, but then gives you $50 back, it is still an act of theft.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.3.1. Pro: This is how governments operate. They never pay back the full sum they collect in taxes. A substantial portion is lost in corruption, wastage, bureaucracy, propaganda, wars, etc.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.4. Con: Roads \(infrastructure\) were built and maintained prior to the "legal" existence of [income tax in 1913](https://pocketsense.com/united-states-government-funded-prior-income-tax-12769.html). The US Government paid for military, wars, etc. without confiscating income from private citizens.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.4.1. Con: This is not entirely accurate. There were forms of taxation, including income tax, [prior to 1913](https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/jan/31/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-federal-income-tax-rate-was-0-percen/).
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.4.2. Pro: In 1910, a group of 10,000 farmers and other volunteers built a road spanning all of Iowa in [one hour](http://usroute6iowa.org/about-us/history). This project was completed in a non-compulsory fashion, and the benefits are shared by all of society.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.5. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.6. Pro: Take 2 examples, defense and infrastructure. The military could hardly defend citizens selectively. If they prevent an attack, everyone that would have been affected by the attack are protected. Roads benefit nearly everyone, even if you don't drive. Taxation for true public goods/services \(non-excludable and non-rivalrous\), are merely payment for those goods/services.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.4.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.6.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.7. Con: Without tax revenue, it is still possible to obtain and maintain public goods and services through different and legitimate means. This makes taxation superfluous.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.8. Con: If I consent to paying you for one product and receive another, I have still been robbed. Now I must go and repurchase the thing I wanted. Receiving something you did not want in return, even if similar to what you do want, does not justify theft.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.8.1. Pro: Getting something in return from a thief does not make it any less of a theft. For example, if I steal your car but offer to drive you around for a month, you were still robbed. Also what if the services given by the government are not services that one would like to receive? Or if those services are of a poorer quality that could be purchased elsewhere at a better price? Not only are you being robbed of your property, you are being robbed of your choice.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.7. Pro: A laborer who lacks the vast resources of the wealthier capitalist classes is at the lower end of a power imbalance, and must ultimately submit to available options in order to afford to live. "Permission" under such conditions is not wholly voluntary.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.7.3. Con: The largest power imbalance in society is between the state and the individual, not the individual and their employer. A laborer is always able to reject a contract or deal which is untenable. Taxes cannot be rejected.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.2.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.2.

1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.4.
1.2.3.2.1.2. Con: In the case of publicly traded companies, yes - all shareholders share the profits and losses based on their individual stake in the company and they generally have voting rights based on their stake as well. The structure of a company is not relevant as long as employees, customers, and stakeholders are not being [taken advantage of](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort). If shoddy business practices occur, then the injured parties must be compensated. This seems like a deflection from the main point that taxation is injurious.
1.2.3.2.1.2.1. Con: "The structure of a company is not relevant as long as employees, customers, and stakeholders are not being taken advantage of." This point is crucial, as is the definition behind "being taken advantage of." If laborers do not share ownership in and have a direct and active influence over the business they shape and the wealth they create, this is exploitation in the eyes of some ideologies.
1.2.3.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Every employee-employer relationship should be voluntary. Wages, stakeholding, responsibilities, are mutually negotiated. Either party can refuse or accept the terms of the other. If one perceives exploitation, the contract should NOT be accepted and they should seek an agreement with a different party. This is how our society works. If you were forced to accept a contract you do not agree with, it could be considered slavery - as is the case with taxation.
1.2.3.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: These are ideals which sound nice on paper, but there is a large imbalance of power between capital and labor, and miseducation and misunderstanding on what it means to maintain liberty as a laborer. When money is needed to feed the family and pay the rent, people may not have the ability to find some fringe of the economy where the self determination of laborers is more respected, nor the class consciousness to even know what's been denied them or what other options exist.
1.2.3.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Capital and labor are interchangeable. One can be exchanged for the other; to say there is an imbalance does not make sense. In order for a laborer to maintain a higher degree of liberty, they must out-compete other laborers to provide more valuable and marketable skills. If a person's skills or talents are more valuable than most, then you will see an imbalance in employers competing for their labor.
1.2.3.2.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.7.3.
1.2.3.2.1.2.1.2. Con: The argument could be made that taxpayers do not have a direct and active influence over the wealth they provide to the state. e.g. social security is [insolvent](https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2016/06/09/social-security-insolvency-when-and-what-to-do/#62945f9f2c51) due to being run as a [ponzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme) [scheme](https://mises.org/library/social-security-most-successful-ponzi-scheme-history). This could easily be interpreted as exploitation of citizens.
1.2.3.2.2. Con: Indirect benefits are still benefits. This argument ignores the point it's responding to.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Con: Any "pre-tax profit" which comes from a "socialized institution" would not "solely belong" to an individual, but to all of society by definition. Benefits should only be provided if requested, whether through voluntary charity or mutual exchange between parties.
1.2.3.2.3. Pro: Many people benefit from the free market in society, but taxation is antithetical to free trade and exchange. Through the voluntary trade of goods and services, many beneficial outcomes for society can arise. In your example of the postal service, I can pay FedEx the cost of shipping to send you a gift. The company then uses my money to pay for fuel, maintenance on the delivery vehicle, employee wage, and tolls on the road. You receive the package, and all parties were voluntarily compensated.
1.2.3.3. Con: "Making judicious use" of all technological advances is not a requirement for being a member of society. In fact, being a member of society is optional as well. Paying taxes is not. Consider a person who wishes to harvest their own food for a living, then trade any surplus with neighbors. According to the law, any [bartering](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/reporting-farm-income-and-expenses) they do is taxable, even though the state did not provide any value in that transaction, nor was it requested to do so.
1.2.3.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.2.1.
1.2.3.5. Con: "[Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society)" is not something that needs to be paid for. It is a collection of individuals voluntarily interacting and engaging in trade. Individual transactions need to have terms which all parties agree upon. In the case of infrastructure \(e.g. roads\), all citizens are required to pay for this, regardless of whether or not they use it or benefit from it. Someone who only uses a bicycle still pays for federal highways, even though they do not use them. A usage-based toll would be more fair.
1.2.3.5.1. Con: Even if benefits are not direct, that doesn't mean they aren't there. Even if one does not bike, more people biking could free up traffic to enable someone to get places faster and also lessen the amount of air pollution in the area. If someone doesn't use the roads, their postal service still will. Or perhaps employees or customers of their business. Society is not a bunch of isolated individuals, it's a complicated, interconnected web of interdependent people and institutions.
1.2.3.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.2.3.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.
1.2.3.5.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.4.
1.2.3.5.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.3.
1.2.3.5.2. Con: One person and their ideology alone doesn't get to decide the meaning of "fair." If we put it to a vote amongst the population whether we wish to live in a society where children should be restricted from utilizing safe bike paths if they're unable to pay a toll, that would give a good idea of where the population stands on what constitutes "fair."
1.2.3.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.
1.2.3.5.3. Con: Someone who doesn't use the highways, per se, still uses the services of people who do use the highways; e.g. the postal service or even grocery prices would go up due to a toll.
1.2.3.5.3.1. Con: I agree that most if not all people indirectly use the roads, however, what would be wrong with the results you suggest? Prices on various things go up, taxes go down, and the people who buy stuff pay for their indirect road usage through that method. Each person pays for the share they use, sounds right and fair to me. Plus you can opt out by not buying.
1.2.3.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.3.
1.2.3.6. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.
1.2.4. Pro: The right to property is recognized by the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution. The Bill of Rights is generally regarded to be a recognition of rights inherent to a human. An individual has the right to property whether the US Constitution, Queen Victoria, or Jeff, the head of the HOA, says they do.
1.2.4.1. Con: The right of the US state to impose taxation is established in Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution. The US Constitution explicitly and directly upholds and protects the government's right to impose taxes, and taxation is therefore in no sense unconstitutional.
1.2.4.2. Con: Taxation does not contradict the right to property. What constitutes one's property is defined by the law, and by law what is taken as tax is the property of the state.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.2.5. Pro: Taxation is often theft when deliberately done on a level such as the national one for the purpose of reducing choices. It is, however, more compensatory in nature on more local levels.
1.2.5.1. Pro: People move between cities, but not so much between nations and language barriers, so a national income tax is more coercive than a local council tax. In particular, local taxation is usually not progressive because people with higher income can avoid an unusually high one easily by moving somewhere else.
1.2.6. Con: Consent is given when government services \(defense, protection, safety, education, legal system etc.\) are used. One cannot exist in a society and not accrue a debt to that society.
1.2.7. Pro: A debt is only valid if the debtor agrees to pay the creditor. Imagine if I left a new car in your driveway then made a legal claim that you owe me $30,000. This is effectively how taxation works. Services are rendered involuntarily, then payment is demanded. This is not a lawful transaction.
1.2.8. Con: Society affords rights and responsibilities to its citizens. Property rights are only granted with the responsibility that one support and maintain society through the payment of tax. Ergo, one's property rights cannot be violated by tax, since tax is implicit in the granting of those rights.
1.3. Pro: Taxation is theft because the money is used for purposes that the taxed may find abhorrent; it thus violates people's freedom to spend their income as they choose.
1.3.1. Pro: Not only does the government fund itself by forcing its citizens to pay taxes, it also uses inflation and embezzlement to further expropriate people.
1.3.1.1. Pro: By definition, theft involves taking and removing personal property with intent to deprive the rightful owner of it. Taxes are forcibly taken under threat. Intimidation invalidates consent. To say otherwise would mean a bank robber has only to walk into a bank, show his gun, ask politely for money, and say it was not theft because he didn't take the money, it was handed to him.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: You are not rightful owner of property that you rightfully owe to another party.
1.3.2. Pro: Funds raised are often wasted and squandered through the inefficiency of centralised planning. Politicians and civil servants use the force of the state to raise funds which then contribute to their large salaries.
1.3.2.1. Con: Whether or not the taxes are used well has no bearing on if taxation is theft.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Even if taxation is voluntary under certain circumstances, the misrepresentation of services to be provided, or any waste or abuse with these funds, is fraud, and therefore theft.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Fraud is morally wrong, but fraud is not theft. Not all crimes are theft.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The government is horribly inefficient. Only a small fraction of tax revenue is used for actually necessary infrastructure, which is then usually in a worse condition than privately funded infrastructure \(e.g. roads, schools, etc\). The rest is spent on administration, corruption, wars, and other coercive activities, such as propaganda.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.4.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.
1.3.3. Pro: There is no accountability over elected officials except for at election time, where there is a significant incumbent bias.
1.3.4. Con: Citizens are reasonably able to elect officials and enact laws which control how funds are spent or allocated.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Elections are the "check" the U.S. Founding Fathers implemented to keep the power in the hands of the people.
1.3.4.2. Con: Elected officials are only accountable to the public every 2-6 years.
1.3.4.3. Con: Individual citizens have no ability to determine how their share of funds are allocated. If 60% of citizens support social program x and 40% of citizens support military expansion y, a significant population is having its money allocated to programs it did not want. Without taxation, 60% of citizens could donate their money to a private social program and 40% could pay for a private militia, thus both getting what they want without coercing anyone else to involuntarily pay for it.
1.3.5. Con: If I buy an apple from you, I have no control over how you decide to spend or allocate the money I give you. That doesn't mean that you have committed theft. As long as I get the apple I was promised then the rest is up to you.
1.3.5.1. Con: The purchase of an apple is a voluntary, consensual transaction between you and the seller. [Taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax) is mandatory, whether the "buyer" requested the product/service or not.
1.3.6. Con: It is plausible that many citizens are at least relatively comfortable with the manner in which the government spends their money. Thus taxation is not, by definition, theft. Instead, if people find the end-use of tax illegitimate then it is government spending itself that is the source of the issue rather than the manner in which tax is collected.
1.3.6.1. Con: A [tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax) is the "mandatory financial charge... imposed upon a taxpayer by a governmental organization in order to fund various public expenditures". Regardless of the perception of particular expenditures, it does not excuse the original mandatory and compelled "charge". Imagine I threaten to put you in jail and demand payment to avoid the kidnapping. I then take the money to feed and clothe the homeless. This does not justify the initial threat of force; persuasion is preferable to coercion.
1.3.6.2. Con: Citizens only have control over how their funds are spent or allocated if the spending is voluntary and direct, and therefore they cannot have individual control over how their money is spent if it is stolen by a tax collector.
1.3.6.3. Con: Any issues with government spending are a symptom of the root cause, taxation. If the state is found to be wasteful, fraudulent, or abusive with tax money, then at the very least it is reasonable to infer that more money is being taken than is necessary to perform its duties.
1.3.7. Con: The boss of a company may use profit generated to promote viewpoints and policies the workers find abhorrent. So the boss is stealing from the employees by denying them a say in how the wealth created by them is utilized and how the company they comprise is operated. The private economy of capitalism is predicated on theft, by this definition.
1.3.7.1. Con: Boss and employee voluntarily enter an employment contract with each other \(if not, the employment isn't legitimate or even slavery\). The employee is free to leave a company that isn't run in a way that meets the employee's standards. The employee is free to start their own company that meets their standards. The boss \(or above employee who starts a different company\) is free to grant employees the right to participate in how the wealth created is utilized.
1.3.7.1.1. Con: When one is forced to participate in a private economy to afford the basic means of survival, participation is never fully voluntary. Freedom to leave a company is better than not having it, but if the other options all tend to practice the same violations of liberty, it doesn't enable escape from the issue. Starting a business is a difficult and risky venture - again especially when one needs to actively find ways to afford to live. It's not a realistic option for every person.
1.3.7.1.1.1. Con: No member of society is forced to do anything except pay taxes.
1.3.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: I suppose this is technically correct in that one can choose to starve as a homeless person
1.3.7.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.3.7.1.1.2. Con: Everyone needs to find ways to afford the basic means of survival, no matter whether they are part of a private economy or any other system. If there was no private economy with specialization and division of labor, many more people would struggle to survive because in the end they would need to survive by hunting and gathering.
1.3.7.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.3.7.1.1.4. Con: The situation described does not pertain to the modern free world \(which this discussion mostly pertains to\) because people usually have many jobs available to choose from in many different industries.
1.3.7.1.2. Pro: [Cooperatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative) are an alternative organizational structure that emphasizes participation of all members.
1.3.7.1.2.1. Pro: -> See discussion #4774: The stock corporation should be universally replaced by the worker cooperative.
1.3.7.2. Con: The private economy in a free market is not predicated on theft because every transaction is voluntary and so would not happen unless it is mutually beneficial.
1.3.7.3. Con: Employees are free to leave an employment situation with which they do not agree \(because employment contracts are engaged in voluntarily\). A worker could even start their own company without being subject to threats of force. This analogy does not hold in the case of taxation - taxpayers are not "free" to start their own government if they find the current practices abhorrent.
1.3.7.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.2.1.2.
1.3.8. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.2.
1.3.9. Pro: Tax revenue getting 'de-individualized' by being pooled into a government budget does not change the fact that people are being coerced into paying for things they may or may not want to pay for. If it was clearly designated that the taxes they pay will be used for a drone strike with risk of civilian casualties, some people might want to refuse to pay. Others might want to refuse to pay if their taxes were allocated to pay for social welfare programs.
1.3.10. Pro: Taxation is conditionally theft. If the tax is a wealth redistribution plan, because resources are taken from someone to benefit someone else. It is not theft in the case of payment for public goods/services, because the resources are taken in exchange for a benefit.
1.3.10.1. Con: Public goods/services could be paid for through voluntary transactions which would be more ethical because they are mutually voluntary \(I really like the model where the one offering good has a suggested donation or a pay what you think it is worth\).
1.3.10.1.1. Con: While many goods that are commonly thought of as public, for example infrastructure, could probably be handled more like a pay for use\(toll roads\) and then only the actual users pay for it. There are still some truly public goods/services, the best example is probably the military. It would be incredibly difficult to selectively protect only those citizens who have paid.
1.3.11. Pro: There are many [taxpayer-funded projects](https://www.flake.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/4fcf3486-328a-40de-a1cc-f88515002d0d/wastebook-2016-final-pdf.pdf) which would not otherwise be paid for voluntarily - e.g. $1.5 million for NSF to study fish on a treadmill, $3.1 billion for a bullet train in CA \(which is still incomplete, over budget, and behind schedule after 10 years\), $36,700 for the EPA to promote the game Minecraft, [$175,587](https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/20/mark-neumann/uncle-sam-spends-six-figures-study-coked-birds-cop/) to study the sexual habits of quail under the influence of cocaine, and many, many more.
1.3.12. Pro: The Air Force recently came under [scrutiny](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/constituents/Grassley%20letter%20to%20Air%20Force.pdf) for spending over [$300,000 on metal hot cups](https://taskandpurpose.com/air-force-hot-cup-price/) for the KC-10 fleet. Each hot cup \(a coffee mug\) cost $1,280. The Air Force has not yet given a reasonable explanation for these expenditures. If this were a private airline service, the person responsible for approving this purchase would immediately be fired for wasting company money. Since this is taxpayer funded, we will likely never find out how this happened or who was responsible.
1.3.13. Pro: Congress has spent [$17 million in taxpayer money](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/11/27/sexual-harassment-fund-exposes-congress-editorials-debates/898008001/) to quietly settle sexual harassment claims against individual members or staff in the last ~20 years.
1.4. Pro: Taxation is theft because compliance is backed by violence; or at least the threat of force. This means that any payment is ultimately coerced.
1.4.1. Pro: Taxation carries a threat of force. Those who refuse to comply can have their assets forcefully seized or even be imprisoned.
1.4.1.1. Con: Commercial transaction carries a threat of force if you refuse to pay after receiving services.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: If I take someone's commercial goods it is theft on my behalf. The threat of force which prevents me from doing so is called the rule of law.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: It is theft to take goods or services without paying for it. Just like taking services from a country and not paying for it through taxation is illegal, the threat of force again called the law. Which makes tax lawful.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Commercial transactions are voluntary.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: In an economy where healthcare, shelter, food, and water are all attained through commercial transactions—they are not voluntary, they are a necessity. If we include education and internet connection, they may now no longer be necessary for life, but they are necessary \(essentially so\) in order to participate meaningfully and fully in our society.
1.4.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.7.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Whether it is legal or illegal, if you don't pay your taxes, you can be sent to jail.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: The USA doesn't force Australians to pay taxes; only its own citizens and residents. Citizenship of a nation is optional and taxes are the payment for opting-in to that product/service.
1.4.1.2.2. Con: This statement assumes that you have accrued taxes payable... which you do by being in a nation and benefitting from that nation's services.
1.4.2. Con: Some taxes are accepted voluntarily. For example, when you purchase real estate, you voluntarily enter a mutual exchange of value with the state. The state provides you with a deed and you provide ongoing property tax payments. You aren't forced to buy real estate. You enter the arrangement voluntarily. You can at any time stop making payments and abdicate your property rights back to the state.
1.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.4.3.1.
1.4.3. Con: Lethal force is not used to collect taxes. Resisting arrest is a different offence than not paying taxes, and it is the former crime that can get people killed; not simply the failure to pay taxes itself.
1.4.3.1. Con: The level of force from the state agents escalates until you comply. Resisting fines for tax evasion will get you arested. Resisting arrest will get you killed, eventually.
1.4.3.2. Con: The parent claim states that the "threat of force" is used, which is still akin to [coercion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion), [extortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion), or [assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_\(tort\)) but not battery. Any of these acts would be illegal when committed by any other entity.
1.4.3.3. Con: It's evading taxes that causes someone to be arrested in the first instance. Even if not paying taxes doesn't get you killed it still gets you kidnapped and thrown in prison.
1.4.4. Pro: Taxation is theft because it is considered as the violation of non-aggression principle.
1.4.5. Pro: The IRS [reported 1,330 indictments for tax evasion](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/irs/tax-responsibilities/prision-for-tax-evasion/) in 2015.
1.4.6. Con: Compliance to property entitlements—such as policing who is or is not allowed on various plots of land—is backed by violence or the threat of force. By this reasoning, the very existence of private property itself is theft.
1.4.6.1. Con: Defense of oneself or one's property by use of force is not "theft", and not even a crime at all. The initiation of aggression against any other individual is wrong, but responding to aggression with force is just.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: Human beings are not property. Our bodies are not property. Threatening violence against someone who has stepped on someone's lawn is in no way comparable to defending oneself against bodily harm. These are completely incompatible concepts that are being equivocated.
1.4.6.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.4.1.1.
1.4.6.1.1.2. Con: [Consent](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/consent) is required to take or use someone else's [property](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/property). If consent is not given, then the taking or using is [theft](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/theft).
1.4.6.1.1.2.1. Con: True for current Western society, but different in communal ownership and communal responsibility societies, such as the ancient First Nation ones.
1.4.6.1.1.2.1.1. Con: In a communal ownership society, the word "theft" would apparently have no meaning \(if everyone owns everything or if nobody owns anything\), so it doesn't make sense in the context of this discussion.
1.4.6.1.1.2.1.2. Con: In current Western society, the assumption seems to be that the state de facto owns everything, and "allows" some people to keep some of it.
1.4.6.1.2. Con: The way to [privatize a beach](http://bostonreview.net/class-inequality-race/andrew-w-kahrl-free-beach) and to stop the general public from walking on plots of land is by threatening to arrest them, through drawing a weapon against them, through the threat and enactment of violence. Private property is predicated on the perpetual threat of violence to maintain.
1.4.6.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.4.1.1.
1.4.6.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.6.1.1.2.
1.4.6.2. Con: -> See 1.4.6.1.1.2.
1.4.7. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.4.
1.4.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.1.1.2.
1.4.9. Con: The use of lethal force by a government is not in and of itself a bad thing. Our governments also use lethal force to - for instance, prevent violent crimes.
1.4.9.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.
1.4.9.2. Con: In the case of taxation, the government is not using force to protect the rights of individuals \(e.g. preventing assault\), but rather they are using force to deprive individuals of their property.
1.5. Con: Taxation exits outside of the system of property rights because it is what enables the key services — courts, police, military — that actually define and protect property. While individuals can steal property \(and thus violate the rights of others\) taxation fundamentally underpins those rights so it cannot be a violation of them.
1.5.1. Con: Without taxation, the free market would make any desired level of security available for purchase.
1.5.1.1. Con: Desirability is irrelevant. Deregulated markets may provide those who already command sufficient economic power with the security they desire, but in an economy where many struggle simply to afford quality healthcare, "security," in whatever purportedly desirable sense it may be meant, is no guarantee.
1.5.1.2. Con: A nation does not belong to an individual so an individual cannot determine the necessary level of security for the nation. The appropriate level of security is justly decided by popular vote or by duly elected representatives.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: Individuals do decide how much stake they are willing to invest in the security of the nation. They do this by voluntarily enlisting in the military, working for defense contractors, donating to veterans support charities, etc. Just because the majority of DOD budget comes from compulsory sources today, does not mean that it would not work in a voluntary system.
1.5.2. Pro: Many conditions of capitalism—infrastructure, education of the masses, currency, enforcement of copyright and private property—are met socially, and many profound technologies—internet, computers, GPS, advancements in telecommunications and aerospace engineering—were made with social investment. "Taxation is theft" assumes profit is earned in isolation from the reality of our interdependent society. Privately appropriating masses of socially created wealth could actually be argued to be theft.
1.5.2.1. Con: I grow my hair.  The state decides that my hair is valuable and thus decides to take some of my hair. Did I acquire my hair in isolation or as a result of our interdependent society?  Clearly my hair grows whether in a society or not. It's my body. It's my property. The government has no right to my hair, my kidney or my wealth.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: By being an active member of society, who pays their taxes \(or gives up some of their hair\) you'll undoubtedly live longer. Governments use tax to try and increase the quality and longevity of the lives of its citizens. It's a trade off. You can keep your hair and live a short miserable life, or give up a little and a live much longer one.
1.5.2.1.2. Con: As correctly mentioned, one does not need to exist within a society to grow hair or have a kidney. It is however a different matter entirely to accumulate wealth and utilize modern technology.
1.5.2.1.3. Con: Human beings are not property. For the concept of property to make sense, one should be able to give or trade ownership the way one could trade land or coin or any actual property. To sell ownership of one's body is to sell one's self into slavery, an outlawed act. The concept of property does not apply to our bodies.
1.5.2.2. Con: This implies that infrastructure, education of the masses, private property, the technologies mentioned etc. would not be possible without taxation and use of the tax revenue. Although in many cases, taxpayer money has supported these innovations, it is not the only way to achieve them.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: We don't know, and can't know, if the creation of computers and the internet would've been possible without state-guided investment, innovation, and market intervention. We do know a deregulated market didn't create these things.
1.5.2.2.1.1. Con: We also can't know that a deregulated market did not create these things or would not create these things because we don't have an alternate course of history where a deregulated market ran its course. The only thing we do know and can know is that the creation of computers and the internet occured at a given point in time in the existing mixed system of state-guided investment and private enterprises. Whether either pure mechanism would have got us there sooner or better we can't know.
1.5.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Certainly there is a finite possibility for private firms \(whose purpose for existing is to turn a profit today\) to decide to consistently engage in venturous investment for potential technology with profitability more than a generation away, if it comes at all. But let's not misrepresent how unlikely this is nor how unsatisfactory an investment in our future this would be.
1.5.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Many corporations have research and development departments which require up front investment and do not turn a profit for many years \(e.g. [planetary resources](https://www.livescience.com/19898-asteroid-mining-planetary-resources-deep-sea-drilling.html)\). Contrast this with government future investment such as social security & medicare, both of which are due to be [insolvent](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2018/06/05/trustees-predict-that-social-security-will-be-insolvent-in-16-years/#69bca4966120) because of mismanagement. Losses from private companies' failed investments do not get passed onto society \(except when [government intervenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail)\). But [society benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rising_tide_lifts_all_boats) when new technologies are created privately.
1.5.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: This is a good thing. The finite possibility to engage in venturous investment is an important constraint to economic activity that ensures resources and labor are allocated efficiently.
1.5.2.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: It makes no sense for someone to work on developing a computer if they don't have food for the next day.
1.5.2.2.1.1.1.3. Con: The government's possibility to engage in venturous investment is also limited, namely to the tax revenue plus money it can get its central bank to print. But because the government seems less constrained than the operation of a private enterprise, it is more likely that unsustainable projects are attempted or kept afloat artificially. This leads to more wasted investment, time and resources in government projects.
1.5.2.3. Con: The absence of taxation does not necessarily lead to 'appropriating masses of socially created wealth', just as the presence of taxation does not guarantee that 'socially created wealth' is not privately appropriated.
1.5.2.4. Pro: Socially created wealth, e.g. from research and market interventions propelling the creation of computers, the internet, pharmaceutical breakthroughs, is often handed to private institutions for private profit, with no meaningful choice or financial reward for taxpayers who made it possible. Taxation is a sort of theft similar to reclaiming wealth from a thief.
1.5.2.4.1. Pro: These examples illustrate how taxpayers are disadvantaged twice when government 'socially creates wealth': first, they are forced to pay into a pool not knowing what their money will be used for. In case of success, the government may decide to give away the breakthroughs to private institutions without compensation to the taxpayer who is the original investor. If they had invested in a private company instead, they would have been included in the returns on the investment.
1.5.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.
1.5.2.6. Con: It is precisely the "social spending intricately woven into society" that is the theft we are debating. The compulsion is what should be unwoven. Social spending should be voluntary.
1.5.2.6.1. Con: Social spending has played a pivotal role in forming society as we know it today. The consequences of removing it are unknown. Many want to give private capitalist economies credit for the results of social spending. This isn't necessarily a defense of taxation, but it is opposing giving false credit for celebrated societal accomplishments for the sake of entering such a debate with a clearer view.
1.5.2.6.1.1. Con: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About) is a [free content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content), [community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_writing)-[based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About#Wikipedia_contributors), [voluntarily funded](https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Ways_to_Give?rdfrom=%2F%2Ffoundation.wikimedia.org%2Fw%2Findex.php%3Ftitle%3DWays_to_Give%26redirect%3Dno) and [contributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians) website which benefits the entire world, in many different languages. This is a known benefit to all societies all over the world, without taxpayer funding \(completely voluntary donations and contributions\). Compulsory payments are not made, and anyone can benefit from those who choose to support it with content or money.
1.5.2.6.1.1.1. Con: Compulsory payments did lay the framework for the technology it utilizes. But yes, Wikipedia is a wonderful example of what's achievable outside the profit motive, and by those recognizing the value of public resources, rather than the desire to privatize and maximize profit off everything.
1.5.2.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: An organization should be able to run itself however it wishes, and patrons or customers should be allowed to decide which ones to support. If the ideas, products, or services provided by taxation were of a sufficient value, the general public would not need persuasion \(let alone compulsion\) to support them.
1.5.2.6.1.1.1.2. Con: Positive benefits could be provided to society by means of theft \(compulsory payments\), but it is still theft nonetheless. e.g. I rob you at gunpoint and use the money to feed homeless people. The initial act is still theft.
1.5.2.6.2. Con: Social spending has already resulted in the creation of infrastructure and valuable technological innovations on which society now rests. To privatize these after they've been achieved through social investment is then a massive theft from the general public.
1.5.2.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.4.
1.5.3. Con: Property law is defined by a ruling body, but the concept of property itself is not.
1.5.4. Pro: A nation requires finances to provide the key services expected by its people. Those finances can only come from the public sector \(taxes\), the private sector \(business decides what government will do\), or by selling those services \(oligarchy\). The public sector is the only one where the incentive remains for a government to produce value for citizens.
1.5.4.1. Con: Democratic governments can make money in ways besides taxation like: fees \(i.e. toll roads or having home owners insurance pay firestations for their services\), producing a service or good \(to be purchased voluntarily, such as the post office in the US which does not use taxes for funding\), offering a lottery, charitable donations, etc. This is morally superior because people can opt out and everything is mutually voluntary and mutually beneficial.
1.5.5. Con: Assuming A underpins B, that doesn't imply A have quality of B. Specifically, even if taxation would be the only way how to protect property \(which is strong assumption\), it can still be theft.
1.5.6. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.5.7. Con: Humans would be substantially freer if they had the option of protecting their own rights, instead of relying on a government.
1.5.7.1. Con: Individuals vary in their capacity to protect their own property. Without a government to enforce property rights, it is likely many individuals would lack the ability to express their rights.
1.5.8. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.5.9. Con: Taxation to support law enforcement is essentially forcing citizens to pay for people to strip their rights and freedoms. Law enforcement is a catch-22: it must break the laws in order to enforce them. Taxes are a means of enabling layers of control over the population — the people are tricked into being willing slaves.
1.5.9.1. Con: Law enforcement acts to enforce laws, as such its actions \(by definition\) cannot break laws - while acting within their scope of operations.
1.5.9.1.1. Con: Allowing law enforcement to be by definition incapable of breaking laws allows for great abuses of power by law enforcement. Law enforcement personnel are regular people, they are subject to the same temptations and poor judgement everyone else is, they can be corrupt and immoral. The laws should apply to law enforcement as well.
1.5.9.1.1.1. Con: Law Enforcement is held to certain standards and regulations and can and is/are still held accountable within the law. In most countries this is true for law makers too.
1.5.9.2. Pro: Taxes have been [used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft) to enforce control and, when used with that intent \(instead of to raise funds for the operations of the state\) should be [resisted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/11/21/federal-judge-blocks-trumps-executive-order-on-denying-funding-to-sanctuary-cities/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.a8e1e062a63f).
1.5.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.
1.5.9.4. Con: Law enforcement also gives us freedoms, such as the ability to safely walk down the street since it won't be owned by gangs.
1.5.10. Pro: In a similar manner, being sent to jail is not 'false imprisonment' because rather than violating someone's right to free movement or association the state has suspended or removed that right in the first case.
1.6. Pro: Taxation is theft because no entity has a pre-existing claim \([entitlement](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/entitlement)\) to [property](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/property) without rightfully [earning](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/earn?s=t) it through voluntary [trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade).
1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.
1.7. Con: Taxation is just the price or 'rent' one must pay to continue to exist within society. It cannot be theft because people always have the option to opt-out of a particular society and thus cease paying tax.
1.7.1. Pro: While some taxation can be likened to theft, not all forms can. For example, natural resources like land, water, and air are [owned by everyone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolibertarianism). Land value and pollution taxation compensates society for the exclusive use and/or corruption of these universally owned resources. These are ethical taxes which can be levied to pay for commonly used services and utilities.
1.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.6.1.1.1.2.
1.7.2. Pro: Techically citizens do have choices: follow the rules, break the rules and risk the consequences, or move to another place where these rules do not apply. If we say that taxation is not voluntary given these conditions, we must also accept that large aspects of life which are generally percieved as voluntary, are in fact not.
1.7.3. Con: If you can't live where you are born without paying a "rent", it seems undistinguishable from theft, as another entity will appropriate some of your resources without your consent, and with the threat of force.
1.7.3.1. Con: Most taxes do not apply to citizens who have not reached the age of majority or at least an age of ability to consent. Income tax, for example, cannot be applied to minors unless the labor laws allow them to work.
1.7.4. Con: No one should impose a rent on property they do not justly own. Governments are not the owners of their jurisdictions, and therefore should not impose a rent in the form of taxation.
1.7.4.1. Con: In actual fact, despite the belief in owning property and land, ultimately all land is owned by the state. You merely rent it \(under the guise of ownership\) on a temporal basis.
1.7.4.1.1. Pro: You are still a citizen of the state. Even if you "owned" land within the country, you are still subject to its rules, laws and regulations. You cannot set your own borders, make your own diplomatic relations with foreign states, make your own laws, claim diplomatic immunity or found your own military or declare yourself your own country. You are therefore still part of the State and your land still ultimately owned by it.
1.7.4.1.2. Con: The state does not own individuals. Free persons own their body.
1.7.4.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.4.
1.7.4.1.3. Con: Ownership of property is the natural state that arises from individuals not stealing the fruits of other's labor.
1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.2.3.5.
1.7.6. Con: In the US it is illegal to [renounce citizenship without paying exit taxes](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/expatriation-tax).
1.7.6.1. Con: Not in all conditions. For instance, let's say a person is born in the US as a citizen. When they are 16 they choose to move to another nation and renounce their US citizenship. They will never have to pay the US any expatriation taxes \(although they have likely benefitted from that country's services\).
1.7.7. Pro: Taxation is the fee of being a member of the club called "society". Paying a bill due for the services provided by society \(infrastructure, education, healthcare, representatives, etc.\) cannot be considered theft.
1.7.7.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.5.
1.7.7.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.4.
1.7.7.3. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.7.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.7.8. Con: Responsibility is the price one must pay to continue to live in a society, not taxation. Since we, as individuals living in a society, are each part of the environment of others, we have the responsibility of not harming others, for instance. We also have the responsibility to take care of ourselves \(and taxation subtracts a portion of our capability to do so.
1.7.9. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.7.10. Pro: Theft implies that goods or currency have been taken with no compensation in return. Taxation pays for goods, services, and protection afforded to all those taxed, and even those who refuse to pay taxes.
1.7.10.1. Con: The mafia offers "protection" when tribute is paid. Just because the government provides something, doesn't mean everyone requested it or partakes of it. In fact many people oppose things the government uses tax funds for. For example, if someone steals my car and leaves me with a bicycle, a theft has still occurred. For it not to be theft, we both must consent to the trade.
1.7.11. Con: You can reject a mafia boss’ jurisdiction by moving outside his territory. The mafia boss can argue you signed a contract by being born or living in 'their' territory. The difference between a democratic state and a mafia boss is technical, but not moral. Both can violate your freedom. In democracy, the majority is needed, but the majority is not necessarily moral \(remember Nazis\).
1.8. Con: Taxation is consented to by the general populace through democratic processes. Like almost all aspects of the law, people can differ over whether tax is fair, but it cannot be called an act of theft because society itself has sanctioned it through a 'social contract'.
1.8.1. Pro: What is determined morally permissible in democracies is the outcome of the will of the majority. While some state actions are revised and held to be immoral at a later date, taxation has been present across almost all modern countries and so has near-universal assent as morally permissible.
1.8.1.1. Con: Slavery has been present in almost all countries until it was abolished in many. Widespread adoption or majority consent in itself does not make a concept or practice morally permissible.
1.8.1.2. Con: This is an [appeal to authority](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority) and a [bandwagon](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/bandwagon) fallacy; it says that because taxation has been historically accepted and is now widely accepted it is ethical. The problem is that the same argument for the morality of slavery could have been made 200 years ago.
1.8.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.4.3.2.1.2.
1.8.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.8.
1.8.2. Pro: Societal rules are not a la carte; they are all or nothing. What is or is not a transgression or a crime is not up to any one individual — it is up to the system itself.
1.8.2.1. Con: This can justify only a little part of today's government spending. E.g. the people who don't want to participate in a government's social security are not immoral, especially if they consider the system ineffective.
1.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.3.1.
1.8.3. Con: If an external group declares that you are part of it and imposes their own demands onto you, that's still theft regardless of whether you have a vote or not. The fact that you have a vote doesn't invalidate that the will of others had been inflicted upon you involuntarily.
1.8.3.1. Con: The citizens of your nation are not an "external group". It's a group that includes you. If you don't wish to be a member of that group, emigrate.
1.8.3.1.1. Con: In the majority of cases the individual is assigned citizenship without their expressed consent or ability to opt out \(i.e. at birth\). Later in life, the only practicable way to return citizenship of one nation is to replace it with a different citizenship. There is effectively no way to avoid being defined by others as part of 'their group' by emigration.
1.8.3.1.2. Con: By this reasoning, if a person goes to dinner with two others, and those two vote that the first should pay for the entire meal or go to jail if that person doesn't, the first person is not considered to be stolen from, because they had a vote, were part of the group, and lost the vote.
1.8.3.2. Con: By this reasoning, in order for the land in the United States to have been privatized to begin with, every single Native American who had any claim over it would've had to individually sign it off. And not under any duress, obviously, or this was not a free exchange. If this didn't occur, the entire foundation for privatization of land in the US is then invalidated, and was in fact theft itself.
1.8.3.2.1. Con: Let's concede the point that all the land was stolen from the Native Americans. Stealing something in the past and getting away with it doesn't mean stealing more stuff now and in the future is right.
1.8.3.2.2. Con: Land can be privatized regardless of how it was acquired by the government. Even if the land was stolen, it wouldn't invalidate the foundation for privatizing the land. They are two separate acts that happened sequentially, but there's no dependency relationship. First the government stole the land, then it gave the land to its own citizens.
1.8.3.2.3. Con: What about the Louisiana Purchase, where the US bought the land from France, and the French may or may not have stolen it from the Native Americans. There was no wrong doing on the US's part. Or the 13 original colonies, which were settled or conquered by the British who lost the land in the revolution. Unless we consider the revolution illegal, again no wrong doing on the US's part. There's enough land there to establish a foundation.
1.8.3.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.6.
1.8.3.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.4.
1.8.3.2.6. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.
1.8.3.2.7. Con: The "foundation for privatization" does not come from the state, but from property rights which are natural rights.
1.8.3.2.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.4.1.1.1.
1.8.3.2.8. Pro: Anything that is taken with force, coercion, or without consent from the owner is theft.
1.8.3.2.9. Con: The state, by definition, does not engage in [privatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization) but rather [municipalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipalization) or [nationalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization). It stole privately owned land "in the public interest" or "to benefit society as a whole". Private, consensual transactions are preferable to any which require coercion from the state.
1.8.3.3. Pro: "Social contract" is invalid, as there is no such thing as implicit consent of something one disagrees with \(even with limited options. i.e: "a" is worse than "b", so we pick "b", but both are wrong and harmful\). It is an impossible concept.
1.8.3.3.1. Pro: In cases of sexual assault the victim does not need to have said "no", but if she/he has not actively consented then they have been violated.
1.8.4. Con: How can people accept something that doesn't exist outside of someone's head? Just like taxation, the social contract does not exist - it does not establish consent, nor is it a real contract. Using it to justify theft is a huge fallacy because in order to abandon the social "contract", one must leave their loved ones and property behind.
1.8.4.1. Con: Other concepts like 'democracy' or 'property' only exist in as much as people believe in the concept and agree that it has value. That ideas are abstract does not mean they don't have power or are incorrect.
1.8.5. Con: Individual citizens did not sign such a contract, so taxation still lacks consent from the individual and is still theft.
1.8.5.1. Con: Individuals, when part of a society, agree to multiple social contracts - murder is a crime because a society says it is a crime.  An individual wishing to commit murder may move to a society where it is permissible, but otherwise they are subject to implicit social contracts without requiring individual permission.
1.8.5.2. Pro: Individuals are born into a society, they do not choose their obligations - those obligations are forced onto them.
1.8.6. Con: Only conscious, rational beings can give consent. Groups, nations, societies, etc. are not conscious, rational beings like individual people are.
1.8.7. Con: Just because society sanctions it does not make it right. Society has sanctioned witch hunts, persecutions, ethnic cleansings, genocides, and more, yet those are usually not considered right.
1.8.8. Con: Since no individual has the authority to take property under the threat of violence against another, no individual or group of individuals may delegate this authority to others. Therefore, the threat of violence for non-payment called "taxation" cannot be legitimately achieved through democratic means.
1.8.8.1. Con: The authority for the state to use the threat of violence doesn't arise from individual authority to do so but is created as part of a social contract between individuals.
1.8.9. Con: This would mean that taxation is illegitimate where it wasn't 'consented to by the general populace through democratic processes', like for example in dictatorships, monarchies, or in any form of government that does not fulfill the criteria of a democratic system.
1.8.10. Con: Grassroots democracy is the only true and pure democratic process. Therefore any tax that has not passed a vote with the general populace would be illegitimate.
1.8.11. Con: "Consent by the general populace through democratic processes" does not preclude theft from occurring. Consider a room with three people: A,B,C. They hold a democratic vote for taxation. A and B vote to take 80% of C's money, and C dissents. The vote passes with a two-thirds majority. Democracy and legality does not mean that theft or other rights violations haven't occurred. For this argument, C's wealth came from voluntary trade \(i.e. selling apples from a tree he planted and cultivates\).
1.8.11.1. Con: Where did C's wealth come from? Property is not an extension of the human body, something to which we have an inborn right to. It came from somewhere. If C's wealth was the result of expropriation, perhaps through an autocratic-structured business, C's pooling of wealth may have itself been theft.
1.8.11.1.1. Con: Expropriation is extremely rare in democratic states. Even then a strong argument can be made the government\(not C\) is the one committing theft in the act of expropriation, when it allows C to acquire another private actor's property w/o consent. I would argue that I would rather live in a society with no taxes and the extremely rare threat of expropriation than a society with taxes and the same extremely rare threat of expropriation.
1.8.11.1.2. Con: How C's wealth is acquired has no bearing on whether taxes are theft. It is possible for a thief to steal from another thief, and it still wouldn't be right.
1.8.12. Con: This argument is basically because lots of people think it is fair, therefore it is. This is a [bandwagon](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/bandwagon) logical fallacy.
1.8.12.1. Con: The argument being referred to does not claim that taxation is fair because lots of people think so. It claims that taxation is not theft because lots of people think so, which is not a bandwagon fallacy because the definition of theft can include majority opinion.
1.8.12.2. Con: The justification for democracy can't be dismissed in a vacuum - it has to be held up against other possible and realistic alternatives for governance. Democracies and Republics have been reduced to accepting some form of majority rule as a result of centuries of ongoing debate as to how law can be made as fair as possible, and it still isn't fair. People think it's less unfair than the alternatives.
1.8.12.2.1. Con: -> See discussion #14224: Enlightened Despotism is superior to Democracy.
1.8.13. Con: Individual consent cannot be derived by majority opinion. No one can consent on behalf of someone else.
1.8.14. Pro: The government's power of taxation is legitimate, particularly in representative governments. The legally-elected representatives of the people pass legislation \(including taxation\) through a transparent and regular process where people have the opportunity to redress grievances to the government.
1.8.14.1. Con: Just because legislation is passed by a representative government does not automatically make it legitimate, for example when it violates human rights.
1.8.14.1.1. Con: It is correct that even a duly passed law that violates human rights is wrong. However, the right of a people against taxation has never been recognized by any legitimate authority or consensus.
1.8.14.1.1.1. Con: Article 17 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) recognises the right to property and that 'no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property'.
1.8.14.2. Con: The people don't have the opportunity to reject the idea of government altogether. People who refuse to be represented are still forced to be represented and live under the laws \(including taxation\) that are passed.
1.8.14.3. Con: -> See 1.8.11.
1.8.14.4. Con: Legislation is often verbose and representative of special interests.
1.8.14.4.1. Pro: The complexity of the legal system means that individuals often need a lawyer to navigate the legal system and assert their rights.
1.8.14.4.2. Pro: The lack of education about civics and legal processes hinders people's ability to assert their rights.
1.8.14.4.3. Pro: Governments seize power over the law by expanding the scope of legislative language as well as creating and altering laws. Theoretically, we only need one basic law that everyone understands: [do not intentionally harm anyone else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle).
1.8.14.4.3.1. Pro: Through legislation, governments create loopholes for themselves and special interests. Through these loopholes they can legally infringe on the non-aggression principle. This gives them the power to start wars, execute people and to appropriate the proceeds of a person's work through taxation.
1.8.15. Pro: The nature of consent differs depending on whether it is being applied at an individual or societal level. It is wrong for someone to steal a loaf of bread to feed their family because that involves the presumption that one person knows better than everyone else. What justifies taxation is that all of society has collectively made the choice to determine under which circumstances property may be reallocated.
1.8.15.1. Con: It is misleading to say that "all of society" has collectively made the choice. It may be more accurate to say that 50.1% of society made this choice. A mob which calls for the life of an innocent person is not justified in their actions simply because there is only one dissenting voice.
1.8.15.1.1. Con: [A link to some polling statistics on taxes.](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1714/taxes.aspx) There's a lot to look at, and the question at hand isn't directly asked, and many do have issues with how taxation is carried out. But if 90% of people believe corporations pay either too little or just enough in taxes and 61% of people believe their income tax is fair, it's pretty safe to that 49.9% of people aren't opposed to the concept of taxation.
1.8.15.1.1.1. Con: About [45% of households](https://www.forbes.com/sites/beltway/2015/10/06/new-estimates-of-how-many-households-pay-no-federal-income-tax/#7510448561cb) [do not pay](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/81-million-americans-wont-pay-any-federal-income-taxes-this-year-heres-why-2018-04-16) [federal income tax](https://nypost.com/2017/04/18/almost-half-of-americans-wont-pay-federal-income-tax/), which skews the meaning of the poll. According to the linked [Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1714/taxes.aspx) - prior to the recent [tax cuts of 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017), 57% of people thought their taxes were too high \(2016 Apr 6-10\). Regardless of popular opinion, taxation is theft in either case. The poll shows that people overwhelmingly choose less theft over more theft: the number of people who stated their tax rate is "too low" never rose above 4%, going back to the first poll in 1956.
1.8.15.1.1.1.1. Con: Taxation is not theft in an interconnected society where the results of social spending are intricately woven into society, and any person who replied to any question with taxes are "too low" presumably thinks taxes are not theft either. Or perhaps a theft which is permissible alongside whatever injustices occurring within the private economy.
1.8.15.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.
1.8.15.1.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.5.2.6.
1.8.15.1.1.2. Con: If a corporation has not engaged in theft or harm of any individual or group, then no person or group is entitled to any amount of the corporation's profits. If an entity has caused harm, then damages should be awarded to the victim\(s\). It is in any corporation's best interests to provide valuable products and services in good faith to the public, or society will voluntarily choose a superior service in the free market, and drive the inferior one out of business.
1.8.15.1.1.2.1. Con: 90% of the population, perhaps more, and many ideologies, disagree, and the overarching argument falsely implied this was only a slim majority. This is a pivot, but let's roll with it. If a corporation denies ownership and the direct and active ability to shape corporate policy to the laborers who have cultivated it, harm has occurred.
1.8.15.1.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.
1.8.15.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Even if 99% of the population wanted to violate the rights of an individual who has done no harm, it does not justify such action. A corporation owner or owners are allowed to chart any path they wish, and laborers are not being compelled to continue working for anyone who goes against their values.
1.8.15.1.1.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.2.1.2.
1.8.15.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.8.15.2. Con: This is a [black or white fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/black-or-white). There may be conflicting moral obligations. One may have a moral obligation to not steal and a moral obligation to care for their family. Similarly taxation can be immoral but less immoral than not having a government.
1.8.16. Pro: Taxation is not theft in constitutional democracies because it is based upon a multi-generation social contract, embodied by a constitution, that is subject to negotiation, change, acceptance, or rejection by society.
1.8.16.1. Pro: Theft is the taking of property or action against property rights. Ownership of property \(including money\) is maintained by society \('a neighbor cannot take someone's car because society will enforce correct ownership of the car'\). Implicit in that is a social contract with the society - in societies that have taxation, taxes are part of that social contract.
1.8.16.1.1. Con: Property is the product of an individual's time and talent. One can possess property even if they are completely alone. There is no social component to owning property.
1.8.16.1.2. Con: -> See 1.7.4.1.3.
1.8.16.2. Pro: Adult individuals who want to reject a social contract may do so, although this typically involves physically removing one's self from the society outside of its jurisdiction.
1.8.16.2.1. Con: This is not possible because currently, all jurisdictions are centralized states, which gang-up to prevent the formation of decentralized societies.
1.8.16.2.1.1. Pro: This was the case in [Liberland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberland). Neither Serbia, nor Croatia claim the territory in question, but both blocked the formation of a new state there. Wherever new states are formed in unclaimed territory, they are usually not recognized by others.
1.8.16.2.2. Con: Children are \(according to a particular state's definition\) often trapped in compulsory education and other state mandated institutions and cannot reject this contract.
1.8.16.2.3. Con: -> See 1.7.11.
1.8.16.3. Con: There is no practicable way for an individual to reject the idea of government itself or the social contract they are assumed to have signed.
1.8.16.3.1. Pro: When people resist their government it has usually not gone well, such as these [seventeen times Americans have tried to rise up against their government](https://www.ranker.com/list/new-american-civil-war/mike-rothschild).
1.8.16.3.2. Con: -> See 1.7.
1.8.16.3.3. Con: The war of 1775 - 1783 would seem to indicate otherwise. Also known as the War of Independence in which the founding fathers and colonists of the 13 colonies were British subjects and in theory, subject to British taxes \(a social, and probably legal, contract with the British state\), but rose in revolt over an import tax of 1% on tea, paper, glass, lead and paints \(after other taxation issues\) and the cry of No Taxation without Representation.
1.8.16.3.3.1. Pro: They were successful in overthrowing the state and establishing independence, showing it is possible to resist the state and break the social contract over taxes.
1.9. Con: Theft only applies to instances involving the individual loss of property that then unjustly enriches another. Tax does not unjustly enrich any individual because it benefits \(and is necessary for\) society as a whole. Thus it is merely the just payment of a debt that all individuals owe to each other.
1.9.1. Pro: Taxation is required for the government to act in the economy, whether that be to provide infrastructure or essential services such as welfare.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Countries without a government, such as Yemen, fail.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: The world record for a country without a government is held by Belgium, lasting 589 days. Belgium is not exactly a failed state.
1.9.1.1.1.1. Con: Belgium only lacked a political party with a majority voting block in Parliament; but this only meant that new laws were more difficult to pass. All the other normal functions of the government operated as normal.
1.9.1.1.2. Con: Countries fail because of a lack of order, not because of a lack of centralized governance.
1.9.1.1.3. Con: [Gaelic Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Ireland) and the [Icelandic Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_Commonwealth) are examples of working anarchic societies.
1.9.1.2. Pro: Tax is payment for services provided by the state. These services are not frequently utilised by everyone, but their existence is nonetheless extremely useful to all individuals. E.g. military and police protection, fire fighters, and emergency services.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.9.1.2.2. Con: 70% of firefighters are [volunteers](https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Fire-statistics-and-reports/Fire-statistics/The-fire-service/Administration/US-fire-department-profile).
1.9.1.3. Con: The government shouldn't have to intervene in the economy, or if it does, it shouldn't be much more than a large consumer in some markets.
1.9.1.4. Con: The government should be crowdfunded instead.
1.9.1.4.1. Pro: Newly emerging funding mechanisms, such as cryptocurrencies and ICOs make this possible.
1.9.1.4.2. Pro: Taxation is security for the government to remain in power. If that security is reduced or eliminated, the government would fail.
1.9.1.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.7.3.
1.9.1.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.4.
1.9.1.4.2.3. Con: There are no other major organizations in society \(except crime syndicates\) which are only able to exist on the threat of force. Most goods and services are provided on a voluntary basis. The government would be able to exist on donations if the services it provides were compelling enough to persuade society to pay voluntarily.
1.9.1.4.2.3.1. Con: No government in the history of man has managed to exist on donations alone.
1.9.1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: The same could be said for crime syndicates. Many non-voluntary systems have existed for all of human history, but this does not make them moral or just.
1.9.1.4.2.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.9.1.4.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.1.
1.9.1.4.3. Pro: If the government were funded voluntarily, it would be more likely to act in the interests of the population instead of politicians and lobbyists.
1.9.1.4.4. Pro: People would be more active participants in the governmental processes if they had a choice as to what their money supported. There would be less public outcry and criticism of governmental actions if the people had direct influence on the processes.
1.9.1.4.4.1. Pro: This would also ensure that governments act responsibly and to the benefit of the people. If such a government would turn tyrannical or stop acting in the interest of the people, it would get defunded.
1.9.1.4.5. Con: Governments provide public goods - services that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, such as national security or street lighting. Such services cannot easily be offered to some citizens but not others. As a result there is always a strong incentive to freeload on these services; something that requires taxation to be universal and that would undermine the ability for crowdfunding to supplant tax revenue as a source of funding.
1.9.1.4.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.9.1.5. Con: This is irrelevant. "Taxation is theft" is a moral statement, not economical.
1.9.1.5.1. Con: Economic outcomes have moral consequences. Indeed, theft could be argued as immoral precisely because it causes an economic harm. Alternately, charity can be seen as moral because it provides an economic good. To label taxation as theft without considering real-world consequences is to relegate morality to an idealistic rather than utilitarian system of ethics.
1.9.2. Con: Such a collective act can still meet the definition of theft; for instance if a government authorises its agents to take items from another country \(as in [cases of historic looting](https://qz.com/1054364/the-british-museum-will-return-bronze-sculptures-looted-from-benin-nearly-two-centuries-ago/)\). Just because a collective benefits from an action does not necessarily justify that action.
1.9.3. Pro: The state owns all natural resources within its borders, such as real estate, radio spectrum, water, air, etc. Basically, if it can't be removed from the state, then it's owned by the state — individuals can remove dirt but not "land"; they can remove water, but not "lakes". A state cannot actually give away such ownership because to do so would be abdicating its sovereignty.
1.9.3.1. Con: This seems to consider "the state" as an entity with natural rights over physical things, but the state is a human created legal fiction. Each state has an official date of foundation and a history of border changes. Furthermore, states have ethnographic and temporal boundaries \(one could find approximate dates before which no state existed as well as human societies with states versus other societies without a state\).
1.9.3.2. Con: In the US these things \(real estates, radio spectrum, water, air, etc.\) are considered to belong to the people in general, not the state.
1.9.4. Con: These public goods and services are better provided by the free market and charity, rather than through coercion. Using violence as means to create roads, hospitals, and courts, or any beneficial service, does not justify that violence.
1.9.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.4.
1.9.5. Con: Whether it has consensually perceived positive outcomes or not does not impact the fact that it fits the "theft" definition. For example Robin Hood or Arsene Lupin characters are still widely considered as thieves even if they are considered as having acted for the greater good.
1.9.6. Con: It is not possible to effectively measure the benefit accrued to society and compare it with the utility an individual gains. Either every individual benefits from government spending, or an arbitrary rule was applied to measure the utility of society and compare it to the utility lost by the individual.
1.9.7. Con: Such argument is logically self-refuted, because if someone is benefitted, that someone is enriched somehow; if 'society as a whole' is benefitted, it enriches 'everyone', even those who didn't contribute, making it ultimately unjust.
1.9.8. Con: -> See 1.1.7.
1.9.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.5.7.
