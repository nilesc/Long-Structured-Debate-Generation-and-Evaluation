Discussion Title: The US should support EU policy to limit cadmium levels in fertilizer

1. The US should support EU policy to limit cadmium levels in fertilizer to 20mg/kg
1.1. Con: Limiting cadmium levels would apply unnecessary pressure on producers, increasing prices for consumers.
1.2. Con: Implementing the proposed limit on cadmium in fertilizers would give Russian suppliers a significant advantage in European markets [telegraph.co.uk](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/04/11/controversial-eu-rules-risk-giving-russia-monopoly-europes-fertiliser/). By increasing Russian influence in matters of European food security, this could shift the geopolitical balance of power in favor of Russia, potentially impacting greater US foreign policy interests.
1.2.1. Pro: Russia is the EU's only trade partner with the raw material to produce low cadmium fertilizer. Russia has already demonstrated its willingness to leverage its gas supply for political gains, and it is likely Russia will do the same for food [ec.europa.eu](http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/?fuseaction=feedbackattachment&fb_id=D8400D3F-E13F-DEA7-92B88181C8A0816D)
1.2.2. Pro: Alternate importers of fertilizer \(ex: North African countries and China\) might not have the resources to reduce cadmium levels to 20mg/kg. North African and Chinese suppliers would be unable to compete with Russian producers.

1.3. Pro: Cadmium is a heavy metal with neurotoxic effects. Reducing cadmium levels in food would benefit public health in the EU and importers of EU produce.
1.3.1. Con: Britain's National Farmers' Union argues a limit of 80mg/kg is enough to reduce the adverse health effects of cadmium exposure without affecting European markets [nfuonline.com](https://www.nfuonline.com/sectors/crops/crops-news/nfu-position-european-parliament-vote-on-cadmium-levels/).
1.3.2. Con: Millions of dollars have already been spent developing "decadmiation" techniques, but is still not usable on a large scale.

1.3.3. Con: There is no scientific evidence that should lead policy makers to believe a 20mg/kg limit is necessary [ec.europa.eu](http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/?fuseaction=feedbackattachment&fb_id=D8400D3F-E13F-DEA7-92B88181C8A0816D)
