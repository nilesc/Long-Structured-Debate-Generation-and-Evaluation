Discussion Title: Should the sale of genetically modified food be banned?

1. The sale of genetically modified food should be banned.
1.1. Con: Genetically modified crops contribute to reducing the cost of food.
1.1.1. Con: There are other methods of reducing the cost of food.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Increasing farming subsidies could reduce [the cost of food production](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/9009-study-finds-link-between-farm-subsidies-food-prices), reducing the final price.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: The harm to tax payers of higher taxes, which are needed to increase subsidies, outweigh the small benefit of a [decrease in prices for consumers](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/patrick-westhoff/do-farm-policies-make-foo_b_594030.html).
1.1.2. Pro: GMOs have a greater [economic viability](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gmoanswers/2016/04/29/3-ways-gmos-keep-cost-of-food-down/#32e9a3201261), which makes them a more efficient crop type.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Genetically modified crops need fewer [scarce resources](https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/water_scarcity.htm) like water to grow, which makes them [environmentally friendly](https://medium.com/\@gmoanswers/6-ways-gmos-agriculture-environmentally-friendly-15a9262d4f8d) and economically viable.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: The supposedly higher yield of genetically modified crops is a widely advertised benefit, which is heavily advertised by the pro genetically modified foods lobby. The New York Times conducted an analysis of data collected by the UN. They concluded that using genetically modified crops resulted in "[no discernible advantage in yields](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/business/gmo-promise-falls-short.html)."
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: It is easy to measure two variables that are isolated and in controlled conditions, and how they react to change of one input at a time. Yields are not measured in either isolated nor controlled environment; there are many other factors that can impact yield, including but not limited to [climate, type of soil or pest populations](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gmoanswers/2016/11/11/farmer-explains-gm-crops/#3ca8ae4e1a23).
1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: There is also a newer [report](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2018/02/19/gmo-corns-yield-human-health-benefits-vindicated-21-years-studies/) that shows the exact opposite: that corn yield results have dramatically improved where GMO's were used. They may have only slightly increased the overall grain output, but they have rapidly reduced the damaged ears.
1.1.2.1.1.3. Con: This study leaves out that GMO seeds aren't all made to improve yields. [It mainly uses](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gmoanswers/2016/11/07/economists-assess-gm-crops/#7540aadf130a) a comparison of aggregate canola \(GM Herbicide Tolerant\) yields in Canada and non-GM rapeseed yields in Western Europe \(also GM HT sugar beet from the U.S. with non-GM sugar beet in Europe\). It also does the comparison with Insect Resistance technology \(found mostly in corn and cotton\) - none of them were made to directly increase yields.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Genetically modified corn varieties increased crop yields [5.6 to 24.5 percent](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2018/02/19/gmo-corns-yield-human-health-benefits-vindicated-21-years-studies/) relative to their non-GM equivalents.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Genetically modified crops can be [nutritionally enhanced](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4346933/) therefore making them more beneficial sources of food.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Many genetically modified crops were specifically created to help improve human health.
1.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Genetic modification of wheat to produce [high fiber versions](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23831790-400-pink-pineapples-and-healthy-fries-the-new-gm-foods-made-for-you/) of the crop enables the creation of white flour that contains [three times](http://www.calyxt.com/products/high-fiber-wheat/) as much fiber as standard white flour.
1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Conventional soybean oil is found in many processed foods and used in restaurants. [Studies](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-10-gm-soybean-oil-obesity-insulin.html) conducted on mice suggest that [genetically modified soybean oil](https://www.plenish.com/) is healthier than conventional soybean oil since it does not cause insulin resistance.
1.1.2.3.1.3. Pro: Potatoes can be genetically engineered to have a lower concentration of free asparagine. The is useful because it means that when potatoes are cooked, they are less likely to produce the [carcinogen acrylamide](https://www.nap.edu/read/23395/chapter/8#229) \(p.230\).
1.1.2.3.1.4. Pro: [Golden Rice](http://www.goldenrice.org/Content3-Why/why1_vad.php), is a genetically modified crop that was developed so that consumers in the developing world could have a cheaper and more accessible [source of vitamin A](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4386933.stm) in their diet.
1.1.2.3.1.4.1. Pro: Golden rice is likely to reach many more people than alternative solutions to vitamin A deficiency. This is because rice is cheap, and it forms a [core part](http://ricepedia.org/rice-as-food/the-global-staple-rice-consumers) of the diet of millions of people around the world.
1.1.2.3.1.4.2. Pro: [Vitamin A deficiency](http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/vad/en/) causes around [670,000 children](http://www.unitedcalltoaction.org/reportcosts.asp) under the age of 5 to die per year. Genetically modified crops should not be opposed, if they can help to prevent these deaths from occurring.
1.1.2.3.1.4.3. Pro: Alternative sources of vitamin A, such as [vegetables](http://www.world-grain.com/articles/news_home/World_Grain_News/2016/08/Golden_Rice_still_struggling_f.aspx?ID=%7BC92F4CE9-6F84-44BC-947F-E98D022BE8FD%7D&cck=1), are often [expensive](http://www.goldenrice.org/Content3-Why/why.php) or not available all year round. This is why developing genetically modified crops is so important.
1.1.2.3.1.4.3.1. Con: [Vitamin A](http://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/nutrition-food-safety-health/fat-soluble-vitamins-a-d-e-and-k-9-315/) is a fat-soluble vitamin that is stored up in the body, so you don't need to get it in the daily diet. In the absence of intake, the average person could be quite healthy for many months, if not years, with the amount of vitamin A that is stored in the liver.
1.1.2.3.1.4.4. Con: The biggest argument for GM golden rice in the Philippines is around nutrition and that they've modified it to include beta-carotene which the people apparently need. Instead of messing with the rice genes, they should be encouraging farmers and the people to eat more veggies high in beta-carotene ie: carrots, sweet potatoes and kale are all high in beta-carotene and can successfully be grown in that climate.
1.1.2.3.1.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.4.1.
1.1.3. Pro: A recent [report](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gmoanswers/2016/04/29/3-ways-gmos-keep-cost-of-food-down/#ea2fd141261d) estimated that the use of genetic modification has reduced the cost of corn-based products by 6% and the costs of soybean-based products by 10%.
1.1.4. Con: Genetically modified crops reduce the cost of unhealthy foods such as carbs and red meats. This affects impoverished people who [already have little access to health foods](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-people-food_us_5b75c270e4b0df9b093dadbb?utm_hp_ref=black-voices&ir=Black%2BVoices&section=black-voices&utm_campaign=hp_fb_pages&ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000047&utm_source=bv_fb&utm_medium=facebook).
1.1.4.1. Pro: A number of companies are currently using GMO's to develop [healthier alternatives](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/jun/10/genetically-modified-foods-health-benefits-soybean-potatoes) to the current produce on the market. As GMO use increases price drops will affect a wider range of foods including health foods.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Pioneer is bringing to the market a brand of genetically engineered soybean called [Plenish](https://www.plenish.com/) that the company says will produce a healthier oil, free of transfats.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.2.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: [Arctic Apples](https://www.arcticapples.com/arctic-apples-r/arctic-apples-benefits/) are a type of genetically modified crop. They have been developed so that do not brown after they have been bruised, sliced or bitten into. This makes it far less likely that consumers will choose to dispose of them.
1.1.4.1.3. Pro: the [JR Simplot Co](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/jun/10/genetically-modified-foods-health-benefits-soybean-potatoes) genetically engineers potatoes branded as Innate which are safer than ordinary potatoes are at high temperatures.
1.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.3.
1.1.5. Pro: Farmers require [less](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2017/01/11/gm-herbicide-tolerant-crops-reduce-overall-herbicide-use/) herbicides and pesticides to grow genetically modified crops. This lowers the costs of food production.
1.1.5.1. Con: Herbicide and pesticide use for genetically modified crops often appears [not to be lower](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/business/gmo-promise-falls-short.html), and in some cases herbicide use is even higher.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Genetic modification of crops to decrease the use of pesticides and chemical pest repellents is not as effective as pro genetic modification advocates claim. Genetically modified crops initially require less chemicals, but often this is [not sustained](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/people-and-culture/food/the-plate/2016/05/17/scientists-say-gmo-foods-are-safe-public-skepticism-remains/).
1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: The benefits can be sustained so long as farmers maintain [refuge areas](https://www.nap.edu/read/23395/chapter/3#13). \(p.13\) Refuge areas are areas in which non genetically modified crops are planted. Refuge areas ensure that insects who would be killed on the GM crop fields continue to survive. These insects can then mate with any insects who may develop resistance and ensure that resistance is not passed onto their offspring.
1.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: This only applies to resistance genes that are recessive, such as resistance against Bt gene product.
1.1.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It has been shown that in some cases, such as [resistance of B. fusca to Bt corn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23844262), the resistance is dominantly inherited.
1.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: In China, the Pink Bollworm, a harmful pest, has developed [resistance](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029975) to the protein produced by the Bt gene.
1.1.5.2. Pro: [Insect resistance genes](http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/6/default.asp) can be inserted from other species into crops. This means farmers do not need to buy pesticides.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: [The Bt gene](http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/6/default.asp) naturally occurs in certain kinds of bacteria. It produces a protein that insects find toxic. Scientists have transferred this gene into certain genetically modified crops. This enables these crops to produce proteins that kill insects.
1.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: In regions where the use of genetically modified crops containing the Bt gene is high there has been a [significant reduction](https://www.nap.edu/read/23395/chapter/3#11) \(p.11-12\) in the size of insect-pest populations. This has benefited farmers who do not use genetically modified crops.
1.1.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: The proteins produced by the Bt gene are [primarily](https://www.nap.edu/read/23395/chapter/6#76) \(p.76\) used to combat moths, beetles and flies.
1.1.6. Pro: Genetically modified crops are easier to [transport and store](https://vittana.org/12-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-genetically-modified-foods). This reduces the cost of food.
1.1.7. Pro: Genetically modified crops are engineered to [grow in more places](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4560252/) than their "natural" competitors. This in turn results in more food for everyone at a cheaper price and also increases the growing season which allows farmers to make more money stimulating the economies of the world.
1.1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.1.8. Pro: New genetically modified crops, might make [photosynthesis more efficient.](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608535/to-feed-the-world-improve-photosynthesis/) This could increase crop yields per unit of land, and/or result in crops which require less water and fertilizer to grow.
1.1.8.1. Con: Theoretical benefits that haven't been shown in the field cannot be brought up as benefits.
1.1.9. Pro: Genetically modified crops can even [reduce the cost of meat](https://www.thebalance.com/can-genetically-modified-food-feed-the-world-375634) if crops yield more feed for commercially raised cattle, lowering the cost of feeding them.
1.1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.1.10. Pro: Some GMOs have a [longer shelf life](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/7128622/Scientists-create-GM-tomatoes-which-stay-fresh-for-a-month-longer-than-usual.html) contributing to less food waste and lower retailer costs.
1.2. Con: An indiscriminate ban is not the right approach to addressing any potential problems with genetically modified foods.
1.2.1. Pro: A general blanket ban would not differentiate between different types of genetically modified organisms and would not attempt to distinguish dangerous from beneficial.
1.2.1.1. Pro: While some genetically modified foods are essentially superfoods with amplified nutritious contents, others are modified for increased yield through pesticide/herbicide resistance, raising concerns about the use of such chemicals.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: A general ban would prevent life-saving or health improving genetically modified foods from reaching those in need of them.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.4.
1.2.1.2. Pro: There is no scientific evidence that all genetically modified animals/crops pose health risks for humans. They should be tested on a case by case basis.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: With little effort put to studying and testing the effects of consumption over the long term, and before these crops are being introduced to our food supply, there's a serious risk that your claim could be proven false any day, by [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945755/) claiming a link between increased incidents of diseases in humans correlating to increased consumption of GM crops and their pesticides.
1.2.1.3. Con: There has been no long-term study on the effects of GMOs on humans - and there could be none, since GMOs entered grocery stores in [1994](https://gmo-awareness.com/all-about-gmos/gmo-timeline-a-history-of-genetically-modified-foods/). In the best case scenario, we would now have a study that lasted for 24 years, which is not nearly enough to know if there are any long-term effects of consumption of the GMOs.
1.2.2. Pro: [Genetic contamination](https://permaculturenews.org/2009/04/17/the-global-spread-of-gmo-crops-2/) has the potential to eventually render entire species into genetically modified organisms through natural pollination, leading to a technical ban over entire species.
1.2.3. Pro: Bans are difficult to enforce, especially when they are so far-reaching.
1.2.3.1. Pro: For the ban to work every member world wide would have to willingly participate. Participating in the ban, however, would make that member's goods less competitive on the market because their prices would increase. This creates a large incentive to cheat, making enforcement difficult.
1.2.4. Con: A ban would at least slow the production of genetically modified crops so that more targeted laws can be passed.
1.2.5. Pro: Such a ban would slow down innovation in food crop and livestock research, by limiting innovation through genetic modification.
1.2.5.1. Con: It would still be possible to innovate using more conventional methods such as [cross breeding](https://www.nature.com/news/cross-bred-crops-get-fit-faster-1.15940) plant species.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Cross breeding cannot be used to insert genes from [vastly different species](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/gm-plants/how-does-gm-differ-from-conventional-plant-breeding/) into crops. Therefore, relying on cross breeding would significantly hinder crop innovation.
1.2.5.1.2. Con: Conventional breeding techniques can take [over ten years](https://www.westernfarmpress.com/management/traditional-plant-breeding-vs-genetic-engineering-primer) to produce new crop varieties. In contrast, genetic modification is able to produce innovation at a much quicker rate.
1.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: With any conventional breeding techniques such as selective breeding, interspecies crosses, and mutagenesis, [it is difficult to confirm exactly which genes are affected.](https://gmoanswers.com/ask/are-there-any-alternatives-gmo) With GM crops scientists know exactly which genes are affected, making it easier to produce new crop variaties.
1.2.5.2. Pro: In the future, the use of genetically modified crops could result in the production of edible vaccines and [medicines](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/edible-vaccines-2006-12/).
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: [Edible vaccines](https://biomed.brown.edu/arise/resources/docs/GM%20foods%20review.pdf) that are in the form of genetically modified tomatoes and potatoes will be easier to administer, store and ship than traditional vaccines. \(p.3\)
1.2.5.3. Pro: Climate change will make it [difficult](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-climate-change-could-heighten-risk-global-food-production-shocks) for many parts of the world to continue to grow conventional crops. New genetically modified crops are needed to ensure these regions can [continue to produce](https://massivesci.com/articles/crispr-gmo-food-shortage-climate-change/) sufficient food.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: Climate change will [worsen soil conditions](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/sites/climaterealityproject.org/files/Soil%20Health%20and%20Climate%20Change.pdf). In some areas climate change will result in increased rainfall causing increased soil erosion. In other parts of the world, climate change will result in less rainfall, and soil quality will decrease because of desertification.
1.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: Genetically modified crops are [needed](http://nuffieldbioethics.org/report/gm-crops-developing-countries-2/poverty-hunger) to help farmers adapt to these worsening conditions. Conventional cross breeding techniques will not be sufficient.
1.2.5.3.1.1.1. Con: It is still possible to significantly improve existing crops using conventional breeding techniques. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [concluded](https://www.nap.edu/read/23395/chapter/11#406) that, " ...It is the case for many crops that the genetic potential that exists in sexually compatible germplasm is quite large, and much crop improvement can be achieved by conventional breeding." \(p.146\)
1.2.5.4. Pro: Innovations in genetic modification could result in the [removal](https://www.eufic.org/en/food-today/article/gm-crops-could-bring-allergy-relief-in-the-future) of allergens from food.
1.2.5.4.1. Pro: Many individuals are allergic to the 9-, 14-, and 31-kDa [protein bands](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250595/) present in rice. Companies are using genetic modification to [develop](https://www.livescience.com/7775-genetically-modified-rice-fights-allergies.html) rice which does not feature the genes that create these proteins.
1.2.5.4.2. Pro: Most allergenic proteins do not have a [vital function](https://www.eufic.org/en/food-today/article/gm-crops-could-bring-allergy-relief-in-the-future) in the crop. This means that genetic modification can be used to remove the genes which create the allergens without harming the crop.
1.2.5.4.3. Pro: Genetic modification is being used to create wheat which does [not contain](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2148596-genetically-modified-wheat-used-to-make-coeliac-friendly-bread/) types of gluten which sufferers of Coeliac disease find harmful.
1.2.5.4.3.1. Con: The recent rise in [celiac](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=3945755_ITX-6-159-g001.jpg) is being tied to [glyphosate](https://responsibletechnology.org/gmo-education/gluten-disorders/) use on crops and not just the newer gluten proteins developed this last century.
1.2.5.4.3.1.1. Con: The study which claimed that glyphosate use on crops is linked to celiac disease has since been discredited by many organisations and scientists, including the [Celiac Disease Foundation](https://celiac.org/main/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-04.pdf).
1.2.5.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: The level of glyphosate used in the study was [1000s](https://celiac.org/main/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-04.pdf) of times higher than what would be found on genetically modified foods that are consumed. \(p.1\)
1.2.5.4.4. Pro: By preventing the allergen [lactoglobulin](http://www.publish.csiro.au/rd/fulltext/RDv30n1Ab203) from being produced, genetic modification of cows could help individuals who are allergic to milk to consume it.
1.2.5.5. Pro: Crops could be genetically modified to help combat [pollution](https://biomed.brown.edu/arise/resources/docs/GM%20foods%20review.pdf). \(p.4\)
1.2.5.5.1. Pro: Eastern Cottonwood trees were genetically engineered to remove [toxic mercury](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17309680) from soils. Similarly, it may be possible to genetically engineer crops to decontaminate soils which have been rendered unusable due to the presence of toxins.
1.2.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.
1.2.6. Pro: [GMO labeling laws](https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/news/66700/usda-gmo-labelling-guidelines/) offer an alternative form of regulation which gives consumers choices.
1.2.6.1. Con: There is little meaningful difference between conventional crops and genetically modified crops. Labeling genetically modified crops and conventional crops as 'different' is unnecessary and furthers public misunderstanding.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Genetically modified crops are not in any meaningful sense different to conventionally bred crops. The creation of either type of crop involves the sequential modification of genetic material to create new breeds of crop which are safe to eat and have traits that humans find desirable.
1.2.6.1.2. Pro: Labeling can be abused as a trick to signal that genetically modified foods are based on crops which are meaningfully different from conventional ones. This is, however, a [pseudoscientific](https://www.thedailybeast.com/were-paranoid-about-gmo-foods-because-of-pseudo-science) assertion.
1.2.6.1.3. Con: There is a different level of certainty regarding traits likely to emerge in new gmo vs newly bred species. This is a meaningful difference, worthy of being communicated by labels.
1.2.6.2. Pro: [Americans](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97567&page=1) are divided on whether to support genetic modification of food, but the vast majority support labeling laws.
1.2.6.3. Con: In the United States, courts are likely to find the compulsory labeling of genetically modified foods - that is strict or transparent - to be unconstitutional.
1.2.6.3.1. Pro: There is [Supreme Court precedent](https://www.loftware.com/blog/could-the-supreme-court-strike-down-gmo-labeling-laws) to show that GMO labeling is a form of "compelled corporate speech" which violates the First Amendment.
1.2.6.3.1.1. Pro: The Supreme Court will likely have a conservative majority soon, which may find these sorts of corporate rights arguments persuasive.
1.2.6.3.2. Pro: Similar legislation, including a [Vermont law](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1210635.html) to require labeling of milk produced from cows treated with synthetic growth hormone \(rBST\), has been struck down by federal courts.
1.2.6.3.3. Con: The Supreme Court has not struck down the existing law, which may have substantial loopholes, but still mandates labels.
1.2.6.4. Con: Genetic modification labeling is often ineffective.
1.2.6.4.1. Pro: Genetic modification labeling is ineffective at informing consumers.
1.2.6.4.1.1. Pro: Congress passed a law standardizing labeling for [genetic modification](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/7/12111346/gmo-labeling-bill-congress) under Obama. Yet the law allowed companies to simply put a QR code on the packaging of their product, which needed to be scanned by a mobile device, in order to access additional information about the product including whether there were ingredients which had been genetically modified.
1.2.6.4.1.1.1. Pro: The [American law](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/07/14/486060866/congress-just-passed-a-gmo-labeling-bill-nobodys-super-happy-about-it) providing for labeling of genetically modified foods was supported by Monsanto in order to undercut more strict legislation that had passed in Vermont.
1.2.6.4.1.2. Pro: Lobby groups [dilute](https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/news/66700/usda-gmo-labelling-guidelines/) the effectiveness of labelling laws. Thus, labels will often mislead consumers, rather than help them make informed choices.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1. Pro: Lobbyists have encouraged the state to limit what kinds of genetically modified food can be labelled as 'genetically modified'. [For example](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/12/us/gmo-food-labels-usda.html), they persuaded the USDA to say that highly refined sugars and oils, like those made from genetically modified sugar beets and corn, were exempt from labeling because these typically contain no genetic material after being processed
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: People want labels because they want to know not just what they ingest but how food is itself produced. If the food item derives from a genetically modified organism in any way, including highly processed foods, labels should still reflect that.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.2. Con: The same risks ascribed to eating genetically modified food cannot be ascribed to processed food that contains no genetic material.
1.2.6.4.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.1.1.
1.2.6.4.2. Pro: Genetic modification labeling is ineffective at reducing support for genetically modified foods.
1.2.6.4.2.1. Pro: In [Vermont](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/gmo-labeling-study/563699/), for instance, support for genetically modified foods actually increased after a labeling law was passed.
1.2.6.4.2.1.1. Con: Such general support does not discriminate between potentially safe and potentially harmful genetically modified foods.
1.2.6.4.2.2. Con: The purpose of labelling is not to reduce support for genetically modified foods, but to better inform the consumers.
1.2.6.4.3. Pro: Genetic modification labeling laws are not sufficient, since they do not prevent consumers from choosing to eat produce that may cause harm to themselves and the environment.
1.2.6.4.3.1. Con: Labeling is "sufficient" if it provides accurate information that consumers can understand. Its sufficiency should not be defined by the choices people make, when given accurate information. The point is to give people choices, rather than force a prearranged conclusion on them.
1.2.6.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.2.1.
1.2.6.4.4. Pro: Labelling the end product does not address the potential for modified genes to spread indiscriminately through cross-pollination, or for genetically modified species to become invasive and threaten the environment.
1.2.6.4.5. Pro: There is already a strong incentive for companies to label non-genetically modified food voluntarily to appeal to consumers who want these sorts of products.
1.2.6.5. Con: GMO labeling will negatively impact the food market.
1.2.6.5.1. Pro: Labeling is no alternative to banning. Ban forces all the producers to switch to "natural" food, which means that supply grows and the price drops. Labeling already raises price of all the food marked as either ["organic" or "non-GMO"](https://www.scimoms.com/2018/04/11/high-price-food-labels/), making it inaccessible to the vast majority of people.
1.2.6.5.1.1. Con: Labeling would allow more products, and thus more choices for consumers, into the marketplace. This would tend to result in lower prices.
1.2.6.5.1.2. Con: In a competitive marketplace, consumer demand will dictate what products are produced, and in what proportions. Prices may come down for foods that are produced in large quantities, due to some efficiencies of scale, but where there is small demand, the prices will be higher for the "niche" market. The parent claim assumes that there is an inherent public good in providing "organic" foods at reasonable prices.
1.2.6.5.1.3. Pro: Prices of organic foods can be up to [4 times higher](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/03/cost-of-organic-food/index.htm), compared to the non-organic ones.
1.2.6.5.1.3.1. Con: Many of the organic foods are getting [rapidly cheaper](https://www.vox.com/2016/6/1/11822658/organic-food-cost-more). Back in 2004, organic spinach cost 60 percent more. Today that's down to 7 percent.
1.2.6.5.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.5.
1.2.6.6. Pro: For those who wish to ban GMOs, labeling is a less restrictive means of achieving the same ends. When these foods have to be labeled, consumers reject them in the market and cause firms to shift towards organic produce.
1.2.6.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.
1.2.6.6.2. Pro: Consumers are already willing to pay more for products that are labeled as ["natural"](https://www.farmfutures.com/farm-life/consumers-will-pay-more-products-positively-perceived-labels) or ["organic"](https://hrcak.srce.hr/ojs/index.php/ekonomski-vjesnik/article/view/5316).
1.2.6.7. Pro: There are different forms of labeling - ["Smart Labeling"](https://www.vox.com/2015/12/6/9846162/gmo-labels) proposition would actually provide the consumers with "informed choice". Smartphone, or store owned scanners would instantly give the consumers all the information about all forms of modifications: radiation mutagens or gene editing.
1.2.6.8. Con: If genetically modified crops become the norm, it will become harder for consumers to find non genetically modified crops. Thus, in practice, labeling laws will not do much to protect consumer choice.
1.2.6.8.1. Pro: Labeling creates "organic" sections in supermarkets, which are already inaccessible to mid or low-income consumers.
1.2.6.8.1.1. Pro: It is hard to afford to eat healthy when you're poor.
1.2.6.8.1.1.1. Pro: [In the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/29/kis-junk-food-dont-blame-parents) 25% of children are obese in low-income areas, in comparison to 11% in more affluent areas.
1.2.6.8.1.1.2. Pro: [In the USA](https://grist.org/article/harrison-organics/), organic products cost 50 to more than 100 percent more than their conventional counterparts.
1.2.6.8.2. Con: If genetically modified products become "a" norm---as opposed to "the" norm---and are labelled, then consumers will be able to choose, and control, how easy it will be to find them. Companies will produce GMOs if they are in demand, and will produce non-GMOs if that's what is in demand.
1.2.6.8.2.1. Con: Organic food cannot be in high demand if it's inaccessible to the majority of consumers. Prices of organic foods are even up to [200% higher](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/03/cost-of-organic-food/index.htm), compared to their non-organic counterparts.
1.2.6.9. Pro: Many foods are unhealthy and unnatural, but liberal democracies generally default to allowing consumers to decide whether the trade-off for cost, convenience, or anything else is worth it for them.
1.2.7. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.3. Pro: Corporations can utilize their patents for genetically modified products to engage in exploitative practices.
1.3.1. Pro: Having a company own the seeds, the additional chemical supplements a crop might need and ownership of the gene sequence is too much power to one entity. Since most of these companies working on genetically modified food are large corporations, it stands to reason that they can easily sue anyone who attempts to modify or reuse genetically modified seeds.
1.3.1.1. Pro: A financially crippling situation for smaller farmers should their crops be accidentally cross-contaminated with GM pollen - as [Percy Schmeiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Schmeiser) discovered in the 90s - no longer able to save seed from their own crops and having a big legal battle.
1.3.2. Con: Safeguards and laws can always be put in place to prevent this from happening.
1.3.2.1. Con: Safeguards and laws don't prevent a lot of companies from pursuing unethical practices. Rather, some use the law itself to manipulate the less economically viable party.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Often in tort cases large companies [win](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/06/26/why-big-business-keeps-winning-at-the-supreme-court/?utm_term=.7aee8ca3f555). This is generally by parties suing them to drop the case because they're unable to continue legal fees. This happens because they have enough money and lawyers to drag cases for years.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Big business [rarely](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/06/26/why-big-business-keeps-winning-at-the-supreme-court/?utm_term=.3033821f19ae) loses trials.
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: Large multinational companies indulge in practices like [bribery](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288533737_Taking_Responsibility_for_Bribery_The_Multinational_Corporation's_Role_in_Combating_Corruption) to ensure that they operate with legal impunity in many low income countries.
1.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Compulsory licencing laws would prevent monopolies or hegemony based on intellectual property rights. For example, if GMO producers had 5 years to charge what they wanted, after which any company could produce their products without the consent of the right-holder in exchange for 10% royalty. This prevents supply restriction or unreasonable mark-ups, while still rewarding investment in intellectual property.
1.3.2.4. Pro: The state could [nationalize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization) the production of genetically modified foods.
1.3.3. Pro: In a capitalist society, there is no question this position will be monetized by corporations, as indicated by examples such as the recent throttling of mobile data of [Californian fire fighters](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/verizon-throttled-fire-departments-unlimited-data-during-calif-wildfire/).
1.3.4. Con: After investing in research and development of a new strain, having exclusive rights to market it is not "misuse"; it is a return on investment.
1.3.5. Con: Without giving companies some financial reward for their effort and risk, the development of new genetically modified products would be slowed.
1.3.5.1. Con: There are less restrictive ways to reward companies, not involving a patent. Plant variety rights also protect intellectual property, but with an exemption [\(see point 4.2 in the linked source\)](https://www.eesc.europa.eu/resources/docs/r_ces1425-2011_apa_en.pdf) that allows crop developers to use a protected crop variety in order to develop new, further improved varieties. This kind of reuse does not require the permission of the original right-holder.
1.3.5.2. Con: Patents can have [adverse effects on innovation](https://theconversation.com/do-patents-promote-innovation-5443) as well. The linked source states: "One concern is that broad foundational patents in new areas of technology could block off whole areas of research and development, deterring innovation. Second, the patent landscape is complex, and if too many negotiations have to be undertaken to provide freedom to operate, the impact on innovation could be negative."
1.3.6. Con: Banning the sale of GM crops doesn't stop this trend. These companies are still [able to patent DNA, complementary DNA, and new plants.](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/the-patent-landscape-of-genetically-modified-organisms/) This just means they make their money by hiking up prices when they sell their work to research institutions rather than making it by selling crops.
1.3.6.1. Con: It makes no sense for 'research institutions' to buy expensive crops that cannot be sold. In the end, someone has to grow the researched crops into food, and that person needs to get paid.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: Research institutions may still be interested in patented crops or genes for research purposes with no intention of being commercialised.
1.3.6.2. Con: The ban on GM foods will scale down the size of Gm use: From bulk use \(food\) to specific use \(e.g. medicine production\).
1.3.7. Pro: Genetically modified seeds are patented, and therefore more expensive. Additional purchases may be required, like with Roundup Ready genetically modified crops. The higher price and technology dependency make it an unlikely candidate to save the developing countries. Seeds without patents can be freely traded and developed on a local level. Help aimed at providing this kind of seeds will have a much better effect.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Small scale farmers in the developing world are unlikely to be able to afford the high price of genetically modified seeds since they often [lack access to credit](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/people-and-culture/food/the-plate/2016/05/17/scientists-say-gmo-foods-are-safe-public-skepticism-remains/).
1.3.7.2. Con: Some pharmaceutical companies offer their products at a reduced cost to developing nations. Therefore, it may be plausible that biotech companies could be persuaded to offer genetically modified crops at a lower cost to developing nations.
1.3.7.2.1. Con: Companies also might not lower their prices for developing countries. It looks like a bad idea to put food security of entire countries in the hands of commercial companies.
1.3.7.2.2. Pro: For example, [Syngenta](https://www.syngenta.com/how-we-do-it/corporate-responsibility/frequently-asked-questions/intellectual-property-faq) state that they "do not enforce patents in seeds or biotechnology in Least Developed Countries \(LDCs\) by subsistence farmers for private or non-commercial use."
1.3.7.2.2.1. Con: LDCs can't afford to buy GM seeds, so in order to gain a hold on their food supply in the future, GM seed producers play the long game of providing it for free now.
1.3.7.2.3. Pro: Golden rice, a genetically modified version of rice that contains increased vitamin A, has been made [freely available](http://www.goldenrice.org/Content1-Who/who4_IP.php) in developing countries for [humanitarian purposes](http://www.goldenrice.org/Content1-Who/who4_IP.php).
1.3.7.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.4.
1.3.7.3. Con: Patents for genetically modified seeds [expire](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/the-patent-landscape-of-genetically-modified-organisms/) after 15 to 20 years. When the patent expires it is possible for other companies to produce cheaper [generic versions](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/539746/as-patents-expire-farmers-plant-generic-gmos/) of the crop which are more affordable.
1.3.7.3.1. Pro: Generic genetically modified soybean seeds produced by the University of Arkansas cost [$25](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/539746/as-patents-expire-farmers-plant-generic-gmos/) a bag. Before the patent expired, farmers who wanted the seeds could only purchase them from [Monsanto](https://monsanto.com/) for [$50](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/539746/as-patents-expire-farmers-plant-generic-gmos/) a bag.
1.3.7.3.2. Con: After two decades it is likely that the advantage of that particular gene variation has dissipated significantly, because nature has adapted itself. For example, roundup-ready crops are mainly sprayed with herbicide glyphosate. Overuse of one herbicide creates [herbicide resistant weeds](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/10/19/herbicide-resistant-super-weeds-increasingly-plaguing-farmers).
1.3.8. Pro: A report by the [Nuffield Council on Bioethics](http://nuffieldbioethics.org/wp-content/uploads/GM-Crops-Discussion-Paper-2003.pdf) \(p.xix\) stated that it was potentially problematic that a small number of multinationals own the patents for genetically modified crops and associated research technologies.
1.3.8.1. Pro: A small number of multinationals are able to restrict the ability of other companies to engage in genetically modified crop research, by charging large [licence fees](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/people-and-culture/food/the-plate/2016/05/17/scientists-say-gmo-foods-are-safe-public-skepticism-remains/) that may be prohibitive to smaller scale plant breeders.
1.3.8.1.1. Pro: This [hinders](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/people-and-culture/food/the-plate/2016/05/17/scientists-say-gmo-foods-are-safe-public-skepticism-remains/) knowledge sharing between scientists and inhibits innovation.
1.3.9. Pro: One example of this relates to the development of [terminator seeds.](http://www.progressio.org.uk/content/what-terminator-technology) This is when genetically modified crops are altered so that they produce sterile seeds.
1.3.9.1. Pro: Terminator seeds would increase the [costs](http://www.progressio.org.uk/content/what-terminator-technology) for farmers, since farmers would have to buy new seeds every year.
1.3.9.1.1. Pro: This is particularly [problematic](http://www.progressio.org.uk/content/what-terminator-technology) for farmers in the developing world, who may not be able to afford to buy new seeds every year.
1.3.9.1.2. Pro: Farmers would be forced to pass on these increased costs to consumers, who would end up paying more for food items.
1.3.9.1.3. Con: Opposition from the public, NGO's and many governments have resulted in terminator seeds de facto having been [banned](https://web.archive.org/web/20131216165017/http://www.banterminator.org/Glossary/Moratorium).
1.3.9.1.3.1. Pro: It is dishonest to use terminator seeds as an argument against genetically modified crops since they are [unlikely](https://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/oct/05/gm.food1) to be further developed or commercialized.
1.3.9.1.3.1.1. Pro: The de facto ban on terminator seeds demonstrates just how much control the public have over the future direction of genetically modified crops. When the public have legitimate concerns, scientists will listen to them.
1.3.9.2. Pro: Terminator seeds would [hinder](http://www.progressio.org.uk/content/what-terminator-technology) the ability of local farmers to breed new crop varieties that are better suited to their local soils and climates.
1.3.9.3. Con: Terminator seeds may help prevent genetically modified crops from [contaminating](http://www.progressio.org.uk/content/what-terminator-technology) nearby species.
1.3.9.4. Con: Many hybrid plant and animal species produced by traditional cross-breeding techniques are [sterile](https://sciencing.com/plant-hybrids-sterile-5619428.html); if this is a drawback to genetically modified organisms, it is not a new or unique one. In such cases, seed companies have always had the ability to limit the supply of a particular hybrid strain, or charge exorbitant prices for it.
1.4. Pro: Genetic engineering of food is unnatural. Thus, genetically modified foods should be banned.
1.4.1. Pro: Even if GMOs are harmless or have proven benefits, some people may find it hard to reconcile with the idea that eating something unnatural is acceptable.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Many people have a skeptical view of genetically modified food as it is an example of 'man becoming god', an idea that has greatly been condemned and explored in many cultures and even within the modern world.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The story of [Frankenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein)'s monster is an important representation of this idea that already existed in the 19th century.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Historically, religious institutions have [often](https://www.wired.com/2012/06/famous-persecuted-scientists/) viewed massive scientific advances as a societal trend that has been condemned, and its participants often persecuted.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: The role of religious institutions in opposing science has been [blown out](https://newrepublic.com/article/122016/catholic-church-not-enemy-science) of proportion. Even though there have been instances of this being the case, most popular religions have in fact greatly supported scientific advances.
1.4.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The Catholic church has a [long history](https://www.chicagocatholic.com/vatican/-/article/2018/07/05/church-has-long-history-of-supporting-science) of supporting scientific advancements.
1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: There are [many](https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/science/catholic-contributions/the-church-opposes-science-the-myth-of-catholic-irrationality.html) staunch Catholics who have made great scientific contributions.
1.4.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Even though Islamic clergy are sometimes seen as outdated in modern times, Islam has a [rich history](https://www.chicagocatholic.com/vatican/-/article/2018/07/05/church-has-long-history-of-supporting-science) of supporting science and Islamic civilizations being a hub of knowledge.
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: Genetic manipulation is a very difficult topic for lay-people to understand. People are generally suspicious towards things that they don't understand. It is further complicated by the fact that the item in question is food, and will go into them and their children.
1.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: Even a slight chance of a food item being possibly harmful in public knowledge will cause companies to do [massive recalls](http://time.com/money/5313348/honey-smacks-recall-salmonella/) with great economic detriment to themselves even though that might not apply to other items.
1.4.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Companies still are more than willing to engage in atrocious [labor violations](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-warehouse-workers-share-their-horror-stories-2018-4) and employ child labor and bonded slavery even in modern times. This shows that companies prioritize the safety of their well-off consumers more so than the possible moral implications of their behavior.
1.4.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Product recalls are not done because of consumer safety concerns but because of perceived risk to company reputation in the eyes of the consumers. If enough consumers actually cared about labour violations, companies would adjust their behaviour accordingly.
1.4.1.1.3.2. Con: Most people probably don't have any idea what's in the stuff that they're eating or using since most consumers don't go and research every chemical on the back of everything they ever purchase.
1.4.1.1.3.3. Con: Something being difficult to understand by lay-people doesn't mean that decisions about it shouldn't be made. Lay-people should instead trust experts in the field to make such decisions, and the experts should do their best to communicate their reasoning.
1.4.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Lay-people don't understand how to design a plane that is safe to fly on. Engineers with specialised training do this instead and the public trusts them to do a good job.
1.4.1.1.3.4. Con: Advertisements and infomercials do the job of making audiences more susceptible to accepting new items.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Even readily accepted things that are generally seen as a sign of advancement in medicine e.g. vaccinations are [staunchly opposed](https://www.healthline.com/health/vaccinations/opposition#not-new) by some.
1.4.1.3. Con: Those people's preferences are outweighed by the general benefits to society that genetically modified crops can bring about.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Regressive societal ideas that hold little actual merit should be solved by educating people instead of succumbing to popular opinion and not bringing about change.
1.4.1.4. Con: People found it hard to reconcile with desegregation, yet governments around the world went through with it. Difficulty reconciling with something does not ascribe a right to not be exposed to said thing.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: Governments are often seen as performing a parental role of moderating societies since individuals cannot perform the same role. Governments should, and often have stepped up and made tough decisions that their people did not always understand or support.
1.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: Most government policies are heavily scrutinized simply on the basis of political party affiliation rather than the merit of the policies themselves.
1.4.1.4.1.2. Pro: Harsh societal situations like war and economic depressions are very testing affairs. Law and order is only maintained thanks to government actions rather than citizen policing.
1.4.1.4.1.3. Con: -> See discussion #6144: Anarchy is the only ethical system of society.
1.4.1.5. Con: Whether a practice is unnatural \(does not occur in nature spontaneously\) or not, has no bearing on whether it morally acceptable.
1.4.1.5.1. Pro: Airplanes/cars, medicine, telecommunications, even cooked food are all unnatural. Utility and consequences of utilisation are a better moral guide on whether a practice is morally acceptable, than mere natural occurrence.
1.4.1.6. Con: There are organic options available for those people to buy, while some people may find GMOs unnatural that does not justify banning them.
1.4.1.6.1. Pro: The [availability](https://www.thealternativedaily.com/organic-food-availability-and-buying-habits-on-the-rise/) of organic foods has risen over recent years.
1.4.1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.5.1.3.
1.4.2. Con: The natural world does not advocate for human survival in and of itself, in fact quite the opposite. We have adapted our environment to promote our survival. Much like building shelters, GMOs are just another example of this.
1.4.3. Con: Many human practices are 'unnatural'. This is not, in and of itself, a reason for banning a practice.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Treating infections with antibiotics, flying in airplanes, and air-conditioning our homes are not "natural" processes, and yet they are not banned.
1.4.3.2. Pro: [Monogamy isn't necessarily a natural act](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/not-born-yesterday/201605/monogamy-is-not-natural-human-beings), yet we've made it such a deep rooted part of our culture.
1.4.3.3. Pro: [Gene therapies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy) have the potential for incredibly positive impacts on human health, but they're also "unnatural".
1.4.3.4. Pro: Modern agricultural practices are already unnatural.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: Radiologically and chemically engineered 'organic' fruits and vegetables are just as unnatural, as are plant hybridization, plant grafting, and even the use of herbicides and pesticides. Were genetically engineered foods to be banned for this reason, certainly these foods and pesticides should be banned as well and we would lose the majority of our food supply, starving hundreds of millions.
1.4.3.4.2. Pro: There is no meaningful difference between breeding plants over long periods of time to posses certain traits and speeding up the process in a lab.
1.4.3.4.2.1. Con: On the contrary, there is very big difference: it is not possible to insert insect genes into a plant by cross breeding, this is only possible using genetic modification. This is a meaningful difference because this kind of DNA transfer was unprecedented before genetic modification, and one of the main reasons it is so opposed.
1.4.3.4.2.1.1. Con: [Horizontal gene transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer) is a relatively common natural genetic process, which can result in genes from one species being moved to a completely different species, even across kingdoms \(such as between animals and plants\).
1.4.3.4.2.1.1.1. Con: GM crops have been shown to have a negative effect on the human microbiome \(gut flora\). [Horizontal gene transfer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1364539/) can alter the behavior of microbes responsible for a plethora of functions.
1.4.3.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Most genes from a genetically modified crop will be destroyed as a result of cooking and / or digestion. Small fragments of DNA may survive. However, it is very [unlikely](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/gm-plants/could-eating-gm-food-have-an-effect-on-my-genes/) that they will have any effect on humans who eat genetically modified crops.
1.4.3.4.3. Pro: [Virtually all](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/what-fruits-and-vegetables-looked-like-before-humans-starting-growing-them-a6849036.html) modern day crops are not 'natural'. Modern day crops do not resemble their wild ancestors because of millenia of selective breeding by humans.
1.4.3.4.3.1. Pro: Artificial selection has narrowed the gene pool of cultivated species leading to [genetic drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift). In comparison, genetic modification changes very little.
1.4.3.4.3.2. Pro: The predecessor of modern corn is '[teosinte](https://phys.org/news/2005-05-scientists-corn-ancestry-ancient-grass.html)'. It has a thick tough outer coating, and only 5 kernels. Modern day corn, as a result of selective breeding, has 500 kernels, and no longer has a tough outer coating.
1.4.3.4.3.3. Pro: Kale, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts were all selective bred from the same [common ancestor](https://monsanto.com/innovations/plant-breeding/articles/produce-ancestors/) – a green, leafy plant called brassica.
1.4.3.5. Pro: Wearing glasses is unnatural, and yet it is not banned.
1.4.4. Pro: Genetic modification of crops has resulted in the creation of many plants which would not have come into existence by conventional processes.
1.4.4.1. Con: Conventional processes include e.g. exposure of seeds to [radiation and chemicals](http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/13/default.asp) which cause uncontrolled DNA-alternation. In this sense, a controlled DNA modification is both more aimed and less dangerous.
1.4.4.2. Pro: GMO crops could lead to more artificial biodiversity as researchers experiment with strain combinations that would otherwise not exist within nature.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: As time progresses, there will be more and more need for innovative research in bioengineering to sustain reliance on GMO crops and this could lead to increased work towards technological breakthroughs.
1.4.4.2.2. Pro: The much more rapid laboratory engineering of genetic material generates diversity in the timeframes and at a scale nature is not capable of under normal conditions.
1.4.4.3. Pro: Using genetic modification techniques to place animal genes into plants should be opposed, since under natural circumstances, the mixing of genes in this way could not occur.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.4.2.1.1.
1.4.5. Con: Plant species, if left to their own devices, would develop traits to prevent predators from eating them, so that they can survive and reproduce. For example, they might develop thick outer shells, or a bitter unpleasant taste to prevent human consumption. These traits might be 'natural' but from human perspective they are undesirable.
1.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.4.3.2.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Before [bananas](http://uk.businessinsider.com/foods-before-genetic-modification-2015-8?r=US&IR=T/#modern-watermelon-2) were modified by human beings, they contained lots of very large seeds and very little edible flesh.
1.4.6. Con: Humans have engaged in genetic engineering of [both plants and animals for millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_genetic_engineering), through cross/selective breeding, grafting etc. Altering the genome directly is just the latest way of doing so, no less natural than all others before it.
1.4.6.1. Con: Selective breeding would never produce Bt corn or Roundup Ready crops, which have genes from microbes inserted into their genomes.
1.4.7. Con: There is no such thing as an unnatural process, if we can make something, anything in fact, it is because nature allows it to happen through natural laws. Any unnatural process is self-contradictory in nature because it happened under the laws of nature.
1.4.7.1. Pro: If human beings are a product of nature then everything that is a byproduct of human beings is, by extension, natural.
1.5. Pro: Genetic modification of animals is unethical.
1.5.1. Con: Random mutations and evolution are both processes that modify the genetic make up of animals.
1.5.1.1. Con: Artificial evolution that disregards potential side effects is unethical.
1.5.1.2. Con: Animals are sentient beings. Making them subject to genetic modification for the purpose of increasing meat and animal product yields is unethical.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Human genetic testing is not allowed for this very reason. The same rule should extend to animals too.
1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: Since hunger is a prevalent issue in many developing countries, prioritizing animal rights over human hunger is wrong.
1.5.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Animal rights don't exist in many poorer countries and most animals die of hunger and pestilence anyway.
1.5.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Countries primarily owe a duty to their citizens. While animal rights are important, they are a secondary concern.
1.5.1.2.1.1.3. Con: This claim implicitly equates genetic modification with curing hunger and then uses this false equality to make it appear as if this claim is a choice between curing hunger or allowing genetic modification. This is a combination of two logical fallacies: [false equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence) and [false dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma).
1.5.1.2.1.2. Con: Different ethics apply to livestock than apply to humans, as evidenced by the fact that livestock are killed and consumed.
1.5.1.2.2. Con: Genetic modification of animals can be ethically justified if it improves the quality of life of human beings.
1.5.1.2.2.1. Pro: [AquAdvantage Atlantic salmon](https://depts.washington.edu/ceeh/downloads/FastFacts_GMOs_FINAL.pdf) \(p.1\) is a genetically modified organism. Genes from the ocean pout and the Pacific chinook salmon were added to Atlantic salmon in order to increase the rate of growth of this species. Human beings benefit from this since AquAdvantage Atlantic salmon takes significantly less time to be ready for the market.
1.5.1.2.2.1.1. Con: It is problematic that AquaAdvantage Atlantic salmon is [less capable of engaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AquAdvantage_salmon) in typical behavior of its species as a result of its genetic modification. For example, the fish find it harder to swim, and they are less capable of successfully reproducing.
1.5.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: If AquaAdvantage Atlantic salmon escape into the wild, there is a risk they will pass on these harmful traits to non genetically modified salmon.
1.5.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Wild salmon has experienced a significant population [decline](http://www.seafoodwatch.org/ocean-issues/wild-seafood/overfishing) as a result of overfishing. AquaAdvantage salmon could provide a [sustainable alternative](https://gmoanswers.com/sites/default/files/GMOs%20in%20Animal%20Agriculture_Booklet_p_d_f.pdf) to wild salmon, and thus allow wild salmon populations to recover. \(p.26\)
1.5.1.2.2.2. Con: Using this line of reasoning you can justify any bad treatment of animals: e.g. factory farming and animal testing. This reasoning is flawed: you cannot justify the suffering of one species by looking at the presumed benefits to another species.
1.5.1.2.2.2.1. Con: -> See discussion #4148: Human life should be valued above animal life in the case that only one can be preserved.
1.5.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: -> See discussion #14258: Animal testing should be banned.
1.5.1.2.2.2.3. Con: -> See discussion #9265: Humans are fundamentally different from other animals.
1.5.1.2.2.3. Pro: Pigs that are genetically modified to have lower levels of body fat produce meat based products that have [less fat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2017/10/27/chinese-scientists-genetically-engineered-a-low-fat-pig-but-for-whose-benefit/).
1.5.1.2.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.4.
1.5.1.2.2.5. Pro: Every year [1.8 million](https://www.medicaldaily.com/genetically-modified-goat-milk-benefit-aids-digestion-fights-diarrhea-video-244622) children die from diarrhea. Drinking milk produced by goats which are genetically modified so that their milk contains [lysozyme](https://www.dairyscience.info/index.php/exploitation-of-anti-microbial-proteins/52-antimicrobial-proteins.html) \(hLZ-milk\) could help prevent these deaths.
1.5.1.2.2.5.1. Pro: Genetically modified goat milk \(hLZ-milk\) that contains lysozyme has been tested as a treatment option for diarrhea using young pigs as a model for children. Pigs were infected with enterotoxigenic E. coli so that they developed diarrhea. Half of the pigs consumed control goat milk, and the other half were fed hLZ-milk. Pigs that consumed hLZ-milk recovered from diarrhea [faster](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0058409) than the pigs that consumed control milk.
1.5.1.2.2.6. Pro: Scientists in China have genetically modified cows so that the milk they produce more closely [resembles human milk](https://web.archive.org/web/20141106050820/http://www.classicalmedicinejournal.com/the-classical-medicine-journal/2011/4/13/genetically-modified-cows-producing-human-milk.html). Drinking genetically modified cow's milk would be healthier for infants than drinking formula milk or conventional cow milk because it would provide infants with protection from bacterial infections and it would boost their immune system.
1.5.2. Con: If the animals experience no less happiness because of the modification, then it is not unethical.
1.5.2.1. Con: Genetic modification is primarily aimed at increasing the yield, as that is what the business gets rewarded on \(profit\) in a capitalist society. Animal happiness is only part of the commercial equation when it increases yield, and this might not be the case.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.2.
1.5.4. Pro: Genetic modifications tend to be physically abusive to the animals.
1.5.4.1. Con: Genetic modification of cows to prevent them from growing [horns](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/gene-edited-cattle-produce-no-horns) can not be characterized as a form of "abuse." It prevents cows from undergoing painful horn [removing](http://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/9511/20170228/cows-become-hornless-after-gene-editing-making-countryside-safer.htm) procedures, and prevents cows from harming other cows and other species.
1.5.4.2. Con: The [modifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloning) themselves are not abusive, but the consequences can be.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: Consequences are studied in great detail and only the unforeseeable ones [sometimes show up](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/452444).
1.5.4.2.2. Pro: With the help of "unforeseeable" consequences we understood much more about [metabolism](http://www.publish.csiro.au/rd/fulltext/RDv30n1Ab203) and [genetics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14616-1), so it has even been helpful sometimes.
1.5.4.3. Con: Pigs which are not genetically modified are unable to use [thermogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermogenesis) to protect themselves from the cold. This is because they are one of the few mammals that do not have uncoupling protein 1 gene [\(UPC1\)](https://newatlas.com/crispr-bacon-modified-genetic-low-fat-pigs/51888/). Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences used [CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) to incorporate a mouse UPC1 gene into pig embryos. The genetically modified pigs which were created were better able to regulate their body temperature, and thus had [lower mortality](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2017/10/27/chinese-scientists-genetically-engineered-a-low-fat-pig-but-for-whose-benefit/) rates.
1.5.4.4. Pro: Although the genetic modification of animals can produce good results for the breeder, this is often offset by painful side-effects for the animals.
1.5.4.4.1. Pro: Pigs that were genetically modified to grow faster were found to be[arthritic, partially blind and infertile](https://www.yourgenome.org/debates/is-it-ethical-to-genetically-modify-farm-animals-for-agriculture) when a human growth hormone was introduced into their genome.
1.5.4.5. Pro: Messing artificially with nature in a way that causes living animals to unnaturally suffer for human profit and consumption is by all measures an unethical use of power.
1.5.5. Pro: If genetically modified animals are released into the wild or accidentally escape, they could hurt the development of their wild counterparts.
1.5.5.1. Con: Measures can be [implemented](https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/421/AGRI/Reports/RP8674228/agrirp04/agrirp04-e.pdf) to make it unlikely that genetically modified animals will reproduce with wild species. \(p.15\)
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: To [minimize the risk](https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/421/AGRI/Reports/RP8674228/agrirp04/agrirp04-e.pdf) that genetically modified salmon will contaminate wild species, the production facilities are land based. Additionally, the eggs of genetically modified salmon are subjected to a pressure shock that makes the fish sterile. \(p.15\)
1.5.6. Con: -> See 1.5.1.2.2.
1.5.7. Con: -> See discussion #5435: Genetically modifying livestock so that they don't feel pain is a viable alternative to veganism for reducing animal suffering.
1.5.8. Con: Genetically modifying animals to prevent them being prone to [disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16110895) is ethical.
1.5.8.1. Pro: Genetic modification is [preferable](https://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D1949.PDF) to giving livestock antibiotics, since it prevents problems associated with bacteria developing resistance to antibiotics. \(p.276\)
1.5.8.2. Pro: Genetic modification to prevent livestock becoming ill is useful because it reduces the risk of infections being [transmitted](https://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D1949.PDF) to human beings. \(p.276\)
1.5.8.3. Pro: Foot and mouth disease and mad cow disease resulted in [millions](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/27/ford-kavanaugh-white-house-reaction-849231) of animals being killed in order to limit the spread of infections. Genetic modification of animals could help prevent such incidents reoccurring. \(p.277\)
1.5.8.4. Pro: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome \([PRRS](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/20/scientists-genetically-engineer-pigs-immune-to-costly-disease)\) causes infected pigs to experience breathing difficulties. It can also cause pregnant sows to miscarry, and it can cause premature death in piglets. The University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute has produced genetically modified pigs that are immune to the disease.
1.5.8.5. Pro: Genetic modification techniques have been used to create cows which are more resistant to [Tuberculosis.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-38810073) When asked to describe the [process](https://www.engineersgarage.com/news/crispr-technology-used-development-tuberculosis-resistant-cows) used to genetically modify the cows, the lead author of the research, [Dr Yong Zhang](https://www.biomedcentral.com/about/press-centre/science-press-releases/01-02-17) said: “We used a novel version of the CRISPR system called CRISPR/Cas9n to successfully insert a tuberculosis resistance gene, called NRAMP1, into the cow genome. We were then able to successfully develop live cows carrying increased resistance to tuberculosis.”
1.5.8.5.1. Pro: The number of cattle in the UK that had to be slaughtered because of outbreaks of Bovine Tuberculosis [increased](http://www.thebreaker.co.uk/environment/2018/02/22/tb-cattle-cullings-highest-in-2017/) from 39,000 in 2016 to 43,000 in 2017. Genetically modifying cattle could prevent these deaths from occurring.
1.5.9. Con: It is ethical to genetically modify farmed animals so that they cause less harm to the environment.
1.5.9.1. Pro: [Enviropigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enviropig) are pigs which have been genetically modified so that their manure contains 20%-60% less phosphate than manure from non genetically modified pigs. This is ethical because it reduces the risk of pig manure from pigs farmed for human consumption causing [eutrophication](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/eutrophication-causes-consequences-and-controls-in-aquatic-102364466).
1.5.9.2. Pro: Cows produce on average [70kg to 120kg](https://timeforchange.org/are-cows-cause-of-global-warming-meat-methane-CO2) per year in methane emissions. Genetically modifying cows to emit less methane is ethical because it will [reduce](http://www.thatsfarming.com/news/gentically-modern-cows) global carbon emissions.
1.5.9.2.1. Con: Farmers are able to utilize the methane produced by livestock through an [anaerobic digester](https://articles.extension.org/pages/19461/economics-of-anaerobic-digesters-for-processing-animal-manure) which will harvest the methane so that it can be utilized around the farm as an energy source.
1.5.10. Pro: The manipulation of animals purely for human need is disrespectful to animals and the planet. Treatment of animals merely as human property demonstrates the lack of respect or value given to nature and other living creatures.
1.5.11. Pro: From a religious [perspective](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/animals/using/biotechnology_1.shtml) on ethics; manipulating DNA is playing with life itself. Humanity should not interfere with God's creation.
1.5.11.1. Con: There is no uniform "religious point of view" on the many ways science "play\[s\] with life itself." Religions vary in how they respond to blood transfusions, assisted-fertility techniques, organ transplantation, and euthanasia.
1.5.11.2. Con: A Western Democracy is a secular concept that does not include religious perspectives in its governance. Religion is a personal matter, not to be foisted on the public.
1.6. Pro: In a country with a majority of the public against genetically modified foods, the government is obligated to ban them.
1.6.1. Pro: Public opinion is against genetically modified foods in a number of countries where studies have been conducted.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Polls indicate that [Chinese](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41538-018-0018-4) citizens distrust genetically modified foods by a wide margin.
1.6.1.2. Pro: The majority of people in the [United States](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97567&page=1) believe that genetically modified food is unsafe.
1.6.1.3. Con: Public opinion in the United States is [mixed](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/12/01/public-opinion-about-genetically-modified-foods-and-trust-in-scientists-connected-with-these-foods/) and cannot be fairly characterized as against genetically modified foods.
1.6.1.4. Con: Genetic modification is supported by the public in a number of democratic countries.
1.6.1.4.1. Pro: There is popular support for genetically modified foods in the [UK](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/two-thirds-of-public-would-back-growing-gm-crops-study-claims-3wzgphgtf).
1.6.2. Con: A study done by the [Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/gmo-poll-education_us_570ea20de4b0ffa5937e0124) shows that as income level and education level rises, people are more supportive of GMOs. This suggests that less-educated people are the main opponents of GMOs.
1.6.2.1. Con: Level of education does not make a person's views more valid when in a democracy. The only thing that matters is which opinion is in the majority.
1.6.3. Con: People should be able to choose what to buy by voting with their money.
1.6.3.1. Con: Some countries, such as [Canada](http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/labelling/food-labelling-for-industry/method-of-production-claims/genetically-engineered-foods/eng/1333373177199/1333373638071), have voluntary labelling laws, so people can't know what they are voting for.
1.6.4. Con: The people against the sale of GMO's are not harmed by others buying it. So only the people in favour are relevant, provided that GMO's are clearly labelled.
1.6.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.4.
1.6.4.2. Con: In a free market where everyone shares at least some of the burden of insurance premiums oriented around statistical analysis, any available choice to do self-harm affects us all, so limiting people's opportunity to self-harm through ignorance or personal choice is a benefit to the community.
1.6.5. Con: Governments are not obligated to act upon majority opinion.
1.6.5.1. Pro: In states which are [representative/indirect democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy) elected representatives are not required to always follow majority opinion.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: Experts who are pro genetically modified crops are sometimes biased. Experts may be funded and / or influenced by industries that [profit from](https://www.nap.edu/read/23395/chapter/1#xiii) \(p.xiv\) genetically modified crops.
1.6.5.1.2. Con: Public opinion acts as an important check and balance against 'expert opinion'. If experts are unable to persuade the public to support their position, this suggests that the experts may be incorrect.
1.6.5.1.2.1. Con: Not being persuasive enough has nothing to do with being right or wrong.
1.6.5.1.3. Pro: The majority of scientists are in favor of the use of genetically modified crops. For example, over [100 Nobel laureates](https://www.vox.com/2016/6/30/12066826/greenpeace-gmos-nobel-laureates) wrote to Greenpeace to call on them to stop campaigning against genetically modified crops.
1.6.5.1.4. Con: When former biotech associates get appointments to [high level government positions](https://www.globalresearch.ca/monsanto-controls-both-the-white-house-and-the-us-congress/533642), we create a regulatory conflict of interest that puts consumers and small farmers at risk.
1.6.5.1.5. Pro: It is not true that we all can understand everything at any time: certain things, like the study of GMO, require years to understand. Therefore, the opinion of experts counts much more on such matters.
1.6.5.1.5.1. Con: If experts are perceived to be forcing their opinion concerning genetically modified crops onto the public, it could result in a public backlash, and an increase in hostility towards genetically modified crops.
1.6.5.1.6. Con: -> See 1.6.5.1.5.1.
1.6.5.1.7. Pro: Politicians are more informed than most citizens. Therefore, they are better placed to make important decisions than the public.
1.6.5.1.8. Pro: While governments should generally heed public opinion, decision making should be driven by expert opinion and not by the whims of the mob.
1.6.5.2. Pro: Although there might be tremendous popular pressure to ban something, it might actually be morally and practically right to go against the popular will.
1.6.5.2.1. Pro: People are still [against](http://www.nhpr.org/post/you-asked-we-answered-why-doesnt-everyone-wear-seat-belts-nh#stream/0) mandatory seat-belt laws, although it's scientifically proven that that they are saving lives. So even when the safety is in question - vox populi is not always either moral or rational way to go.
1.6.5.2.2. Pro: Public opinion changes with time. It was once public opinion to not allow women to vote. Just because a majority has an opinion, that doesn't make it morally or ethically right.
1.6.5.3. Pro: Public opinion is sometimes mistaken and not supported by factual evidence. Therefore, it would be imprudent to make legislation banning GMOs based on pubic opinion.
1.6.5.4. Pro: Democracy is not a dictatorship of the masses. Consumption/purchase of GMOs is an individual choice which does not affect another person. Voting to ban such right to other people is like banning gay marriage. It is not up to the majority \(or anyone\) to decide how an individual should love or spend money.
1.6.5.5. Con: The people do not serve the government; the government serves the people.
1.6.5.5.1. Pro: Public opinion is the [basis of power](https://www.econlib.org/library/LFBooks/Hume/hmMPL.html?chapter_num=9#book-reader) in all societies. It would be very unwise to run too far ahead of public opinion.
1.6.5.5.2. Con: There are at least [two problems](https://blogs.worldbank.org/publicsphere/public-opinion-should-leaders-follow-it-or-lead-it) with always trusting the people: expertise or civic competence and the ever present danger of the powerful sway of ugly passions and prejudices.
1.6.6. Pro: Government agencies should at least respond to grievances from concerned citizens with assurances for those concerned to be able to exercise consumer choice.
1.6.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
1.6.7. Pro: Food is unavoidable, omnipresent and necessary. The quality of food has a widespread, systematic and long-term impact on all members of the society - questions with these features must be decided by general public in democratic states, especially when the long-term impact is unknown.
1.6.8. Pro: When there is no unambiguous, logical and informed decision that can be made by the government, the public must have the final word.
1.6.8.1. Pro: We have banned medications that were on the market for anywhere from [1 to 55 years](https://prescriptiondrugs.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=005528) - because of the undiscovered side effects, or actual consequences that require long-term usage to manifest. GM foods have been present in stores only since 1994 \(USA\), and hence we only have insight into what the effects of usage are after 24 years.
1.7. Pro: Genetically modified crops threaten biodiversity.
1.7.1. Con: Commercial agriculture itself[threatens biodiversity](http://www.ducks.org/conservation/waterfowl-habitat/biodiversity-in-the-grassland-biome). Native species are plowed under to plant fields-ful of a limited number of species. There is no implication, in the parent argument, that MORE land area will be planted due to the use of GMO
1.7.2. Pro: Often plants are genetically modified without consideration of how the new species will interact with other species in the environment.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Scotts Miracle-Gro [genetically engineered golf course grass](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/challenging-evolution-how-gmos-can-influence-genetic-diversity/) that was resistant to herbicide. But because the grass was wind pollinated and could easily cross breed, the herbicide resistance gene was found in wild grass nine miles from the origin, only one year after it was planted.
1.7.2.2. Con: Natural processes are chaotic enough. New invasive species killing older ecosystems is very well the way of nature as the [extinction](https://curiosity.com/topics/99-percent-of-the-earths-species-are-extinctbut-thats-not-the-worst-of-it-curiosity/) of most species on earth shows. Mankind is simply following the natural order of things.
1.7.3. Pro: Some genetically modified crops are specifically engineered to be more [disease resistant](https://www.medicalnewsbulletin.com/disease-resistant-genetically-modified-crops/) than their naturally diversified variants. This makes them more likely to be selected over their non-disease resistant counterparts.
1.7.4. Con: Biodiversity has no intrinsic value which should be preserved.
1.7.4.1. Con: Biodiversity helps protect crops from crop crashes, such as the [Banana Famine](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/bananageddon-millions-face-hunger-as-deadly-fungus-decimates-global-banana-crop-9239464.html) and [Irish Potato Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_%28Ireland%29). Biodiversity has intrinsic value to ensure a single pest cannot decimate crops.
1.7.5. Pro: Companies will pick the genetically strongest crops to mass produce, which leads to [monoculture cropping](https://www.propagate.org/research/2017/9/4/biosecurity-vulnerabilities-in-crop-monocultures). This could make massive amounts of crops vulnerable to disease or blight all at the same time.
1.7.6. Con: Genetic modification can be used to prevent certain crops from becoming [extinct](https://nypost.com/2018/07/06/bananas-are-facing-extinction/).
1.7.6.1. Pro: Modern crops, following years of selective breeding, lack genetic diversity. This makes them [particularly vulnerable](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/25/science/loss-of-genetic-diversity-imperils-crop-advances.html) to extinction as a result of disease and / or climate change.
1.7.6.1.1. Pro: Blight is a disease which can have a [devastating impact](https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/22068/PDF) on wheat and barley yields. Genetic modification may help make these crops less vulnerable to blight.
1.7.6.2. Pro: In 1992 the Papaya ringspot virus significantly reduced Hawaii's papaya yields. The introduction of a genetically modified virus resistant version of the crop in 1998 [reversed](https://www.nap.edu/read/23395/chapter/7#101) \(p.101\) the decline in papaya yield caused by the Papaya ringspot virus.
1.7.7. Con: Genetically modified crops lead to more natural biodiversity because fewer agricultural space is needed for the same yield, allowing fields to stay fallow.
1.7.7.1. Pro: Cultivated land is often making use of monocultures. This reduces biodiversity in the fields.
1.7.7.2. Pro: Cultivated land makes use of pesticides and herbicides which reduce biodiversity.
1.7.7.3. Con: [Permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture) farming practices can be used to create a biodiverse, high output operation without utilizing GMO products.
1.7.8. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.
1.7.9. Con: These effects are considered during the licensing process. This is an argument for more stringent oversight, not an outright ban.
1.7.9.1. Con: Just because an argument supports stricter scrutiny does not mean the same argument doesn't also support a ban. This argument seems to support a ban or greater oversight. You'd have to argue that banning is worse than not banning for it to support just greater regulations and not a ban.
1.7.10. Pro: If genes from a genetically modified crop are transferred to wild versions of the crop, this will potentially [reduce](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.4161/gmcr.2.1.15086) \(p.8\) the pool of genes available to improve the crop in the future.
1.7.10.1. Pro: It is particularly difficult to prevent [pollen](https://friendsoftheearth.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/gm_crops_food.pdf) \(p.5\) spreading genes between conventional crops and genetically modified crops. This is because pollen can travel large distances and overcome obstacles such as barrier crops.
1.7.10.1.1. Con: It is possible to [avoid](https://biomed.brown.edu/arise/resources/docs/GM%20foods%20review.pdf) this problem by creating genetically modified male crops which are sterile.
1.7.10.1.1.1. Con: Latest research indicates that consumption of sterile genes has [negative effect on human fertility](https://natural-fertility-info.com/gmo-infertility.html).
1.7.10.1.2. Con: To avoid this issue crops can be altered so that the pollen produced by the plant doesn't contain the [introduced gene](https://biomed.brown.edu/arise/resources/docs/GM%20foods%20review.pdf). \(p.6\)
1.8. Con: Genetically modified crops can work towards mitigating world hunger and nutritional deficiencies.
1.8.1. Pro: Introducing [dwarf genes](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/secret-of-high-yield-crop-gene-identified-1106672.html) into genetically modified crops, reduces the height of crops, and thus, increases the amount of nutrients available for grain production. This can increase yields.
1.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Even if the dwarf gene does not result in increased yields, by using less of its nutrients to grow in height it may save in fertilizers, or produce well in poor soil.
1.8.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.8.3. Con: The world already produces [enough food](https://www.nature.com/articles/35005264) to feed the global population. Genetically modified crops are thus not needed to solve world hunger. We should instead focus on ensuring equitable distribution of existing non-modified food supplies.
1.8.3.1. Con: Producing more food per acre of land will still be valuable as the world population grows, to prevent destruction of wilderness areas by turning them into farmland.
1.8.3.2. Con: These two approaches are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they are complementary to one another.
1.8.3.3. Pro: Problems of insufficiency and unavailability should be addressed by [restructuring the supply chain and distribution](https://www.fastcompany.com/3062692/the-real-reason-theres-world-hunger-food-waste-not-food-shortages) of food. We don't need more food, we need it to be better allocated.
1.8.3.4. Con: Despite adequate global food production, people still go hungry. Since distribution of food isn't necessarily improving anytime soon on account of being reliant on socio-economic factors, genetically modified crops offer a solution that works.
1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.
1.8.6. Pro: Genetically modified crops are often more resistant to disease and pests. This is advantagous because it helps to [increase](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/people-and-culture/food/the-plate/2016/05/17/scientists-say-gmo-foods-are-safe-public-skepticism-remains/) crop yields.
1.8.7. Pro: The world's population is increasing. This will increase the global demand for food. Genetic modification will help farmers to meet this demand, by enabling growth in [previously](https://biomed.brown.edu/arise/resources/docs/GM%20foods%20review.pdf) unfavorable locations. \(p.3\)
1.8.7.1. Pro: Genetically modified crops could enable crop growth in previously unfavorable environments, such as [salty soils](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166913007192). This may significantly enhance the diet of many people in the developing world.
1.8.7.1.1. Pro: High levels of [salt in soil](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166913007192) reduces the agricultural potential of an estimated 45 million hectares of irrigated land. It slows crop growth, and reduces the rate at which crops can reproduce. Genetic modification may enable crops to overcome this.
1.8.7.2. Pro: Inserting [anti freeze genes](https://biomed.brown.edu/arise/resources/docs/GM%20foods%20review.pdf) from cold water fish into crops such as potatoes can increase the ability of crops to tolerate cold temperatures. \(p.2\)
1.8.7.3. Con: -> See 1.3.7.
1.8.8. Con: The idea that GM crops are needed to feed the world is dismissed by experts as public relations fiction. The World Bank sponsored [IAASTD Report](http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/est/Investment/Agriculture_at_a_Crossroads_Global_Report_IAASTD.pdf), one of the most comprehensive reports on the future of agriculture, did not endorse GMOs as a solution to world hunger.
1.8.8.1. Con: By 2050, the world will have an extra two billion people. Even if genetically modified crops are not 'essential' to ensure food security, growing genetically modified crops will make it significantly [easier](https://www.popsci.com/article/science/core-truths-10-common-gmo-claims-debunked) to ensure the world's population has sufficient food.
1.8.9. Pro: Genetically modifying cereal crops, so that they absorb nitrogen, would increase [yields](https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-biology/2017/03/02/establishing-symbiotic-nitrogen-fixation-cereals-non-legume-crops-greener-nitrogen-revolution/) and boost the [protein](https://www.csun.edu/~hcbio027/biotechnology/lec10/lindemann.html) content of staple foods.
1.8.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.
1.9. Pro: There is insufficient research into GMOs. They should be banned until they can be confirmed to be safe for people and the environment.
1.9.1. Pro: The European Commission cites the lack of [long term research](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6122/883.full?rss=1) into genetically modified food as the reason for delaying authorization to EU states to grow some genetically modified crops.
1.9.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.9.2. Pro: The research that is done, is done on animals rather then on humans. The reason [that is provided](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/01/13/no-long-term-gmo-studies-humans/) is that human research would be unethical. It makes no sense that doing research on humans is deemed unethical, but rolling out untested genetically modified crops into the human population is not.
1.9.3. Pro: The state should abide by the [precautionary principle](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/news/140214-gm-foods-and-application-of-the-precautionary-principle-in-europe/). Genetically modified crops should not be used unless it is certain that no harmful consequences will be caused by their use.
1.9.3.1. Con: No one can ever guarantee that the use of new technologies will be completely without risk, so adopting the precautionary principle would result in a ban on any form of new technology.
1.9.3.1.1. Pro: Cellphones as of today still cannot be confirmed absolutely safe but the risk is considered very small, compared to the benefits. The same applies to GMOs.
1.9.3.2. Con: Not adopting genetically modified crops will result in many people facing a greater risk of starvation. Adopting the precautionary principle will thus increase, not decrease, the risks they face.
1.9.3.3. Pro: [Resistance/tolerance](https://livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe70s/pests_08.html) to the broad pesticides that are used on GM crops is a known harmful consequence.
1.9.4. Con: The scientific consensus is that there is sufficient research to conclude that genetically modified crops are safe for people and the environment.
1.9.4.1. Pro: A [meta-analysis](https://www.sciencealert.com/after-two-decades-and-6-000-studies-scientists-find-gmos-in-corn-are-actually-good-for-you) of 6,000 studies across two decades concluded that GMO's pose no risk to human health.
1.9.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.4.2.1.1.1.
1.9.4.2. Pro: A panel of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences [has stated](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23395/genetically-engineered-crops-experiences-and-prospects) that GMOs are safe.
1.9.4.3. Pro: Genetically modified crops can only be grown if they are [approved](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/gm-plants/how-are-gm-crops-regulated/) for use by the appropriate regional agency. Genetically modified crops are only approved if there is scientific evidence that they will not harm the environment or people.
1.9.4.3.1. Pro: According to scientists and to the USDA, [we have done enough research](https://gmoanswers.com/ask/are-there-any-long-term-30-years-studies-done-full-spectrum-ecological-impact-transgenic-gmo) to verify both the impact on people and animals, as well as the ecological impact of genetically modified crops.
1.9.4.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.9.4.5. Pro: [Studies](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/will-gmos-hurt-my-body/) have shown that GMOs do not cause organ toxicity or other adverse health effects. Scientists have been able to demonstrate this from tests with rats in which they found GMOs were not toxic to the animals.
1.9.5. Pro: Biotech companies often use industry studies to demonstrate the safety of their GM foods. However, often such “research” is “[Tobacco Science](https://www.ecowatch.com/monsantos-tobacco-files-university-scientists-caught-conspiring-with-b-1882095786.html)” - research carefully constructed to cover-up the truth and danger.
1.9.5.1. Pro: Monsanto has been [accused](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/09/monsanto-trial-roundup-weedkiller-cancer-dewayne-johnson) of "bullying" scientists and hiding research to suppress evidence of the potential dangers the company is responsible for causing.
1.9.5.1.1. Pro: Actions such as this have resulted in anti-GMO activists [dubbing](https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-complete-history-of-monsanto-the-worlds-most-evil-corporation/5387964) the company as "the worlds most evil corporation".
1.9.5.1.1.1. Con: In 2009, Monsanto met with scientists to address their concerns about the state of genetically modified food research. Following this meeting, Monsanto [agreed](https://grist.org/food/genetically-modified-seed-research-whats-locked-and-what-isnt/) to allow all US universities to conduct research on Monsanto's genetically modified seeds without seeking permission from Monsanto or needing to sign a contract.
1.9.5.1.1.1.1. Con: A major limitation of this agreement is that scientists are [not permitted](https://grist.org/food/genetically-modified-seed-research-whats-locked-and-what-isnt/) to work with seeds prior to their commercial release.
1.9.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.9.5.1.1.1.
1.9.5.2. Con: The majority of research which states that genetically modified foods are safe is [not funded](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2017/09/01/monsanto-shill-alert-industry-funded-gmo-research-bias-findings/) by biotech companies. The GENetic Engineering Risk Atlas \([GENERA](https://genera.biofortified.org/wp/)\) is a public database of available research. The Genetic Literacy project and Biology Fortified Inc analysed the database and demonstrated that [over 50%](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2017/09/01/monsanto-shill-alert-industry-funded-gmo-research-bias-findings/) of the research on genetically modified foods has been university or government funded.
1.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.6.8.1.
1.9.7. Con: Even if a possibility of GMOs being unsafe remains despite evidence that says otherwise, people dying of hunger is an actual everyday concern and denying them the food that they could otherwise acquire is wrong.
1.9.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.
1.9.7.2. Con: Instead of trying to control nature, humans could adapt their diet to what can be successfully grown in our changing climates, rather than trying to modify crops to adapt to the changes.
1.9.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.4.4.
1.9.7.3. Con: -> See 1.5.1.2.1.1.3.
1.9.7.4. Con: Genetically modified food endangers the health of people who consume it.
1.9.7.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.
1.9.7.4.2. Pro: Genetically modified crops have been linked to weight gain. Because the crops are [bred for higher yields, they contain fewer nutrients](https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a20433466/gmo-foods-linked-to-weight-gain/) and require higher levels of consumption to produce nutritional benefits.
1.9.7.4.2.1. Con: GMOs are "bred" for whatever the market demands. In first-world countries, that would be taste \(i.e. making sweet corn sweeter\). This argument attacks the tool \(GMO technology\) for the results \(how people will use the technology, based on their own demands\).
1.9.7.4.2.2. Con: Weight gain \(through higher yields and more caloric density in foods\) would be a good thing in third world countries.
1.9.7.4.2.3. Con: The above study involves rats. Obesity in humans is not primarily a [result](http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight) of nutrient deficiency.
1.9.7.4.3. Con: There is nothing inherent to genetic modification that makes food dangerous.
1.9.7.4.4. Con: Genetically modified food is subjected to [more rigorous safety checks](http://www.who.int/foodsafety/areas_work/food-technology/faq-genetically-modified-food/en/) than its conventional counterpart.
1.9.7.4.4.1. Con: Genetically modified crops should have more rigorous checks, as these foods are produced with new technology. These extra checks serve to safeguard the GM aspect, they do not apply to non-GM crops. Passing these checks does not necessarily make GM crops safer than non-GM. Listing them as an advantage over non-GM is misleading.
1.9.7.4.4.1.1. Con: By the same token, passing basic checks used to verify the safety of non-GM crops does not make non-GM food necessarily safe. There is no absolute safety standard and rigorous safety checks are the best method to reduce uncertainty about the safety status of any food.
1.9.7.4.4.2. Con: Having extra safety checks on some product A that might be more dangerous than some product B does not indicate that product A is safer than or as safe as product B. \(Where product B has fewer safety checks.\)
1.9.7.4.4.3. Con: GM foods are often [tested](http://earthopensource.org/gmomythsandtruths/sample-page/2-science-regulation/2-1-myth-gm-foods-strictly-tested-regulated-safety/) by the same companies that want to commercialise them. Such tests are weak and inadequate to show safety.
1.9.7.4.4.4. Con: The US does not require genetically engineered plants to be proven safe. The FDA claims that GM foods can be [marketed](https://http://americannutritionassociation.org/newsletter/gmo-foods-world-wide-scandal) without prior testing because they are GRAS “generally recognized as safe”.
1.9.7.4.4.4.1. Con: The FDA's [website](https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GEPlants/ucm461805.htm) clearly states that: "Foods from \[genetically modified\] plants must meet the same food safety requirements as foods derived from traditionally bred plants."
1.9.7.4.4.4.2. Con: The FDA has the power to stop any food from going to market. Thus in practice, biotech companies [cooperate](https://grist.org/food/the-gm-safety-dance-whats-rule-and-whats-real/) with the FDA and ensure their products pass safety requirements prior to their release.
1.9.7.4.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.9.7.4.6. Con: This is simply [false](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/well/eat/are-gmo-foods-safe.html). Experts from the American Medical Association, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the World Health Organization, and 90% of scientists believe that GMOs are perfectly safe to consume.
1.9.7.4.7. Pro: Globally the use of glyphosate has dramatically increased since the introduction of GM glyphosate-tolerant crops. Glyphosate has been identified as a cause for concern since it can be linked to many health [problems](http://earthopensource.org/gmomythsandtruths/sample-page/4-health-hazards-roundup-glyphosate/4-1-myth-roundup-safe-herbicide-low-toxicity-animals-humans/).
1.9.7.4.7.1. Pro: Monsanto relies heavily on the glyphosate-based herbicide, Roundup, which [scientists](http://non-gmoreport.com/articles/scientists-ground-breaking-research-uncovers-new-risks-gmos-glyphosate/) have found to be a causative link of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
1.9.7.4.7.2. Pro: [Studies](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/tx1001749) show glyphosate-based herbicides can disturb the development of foetuses, causing birth defects.
1.9.7.4.7.3. Pro: There have been higher than expected levels of glyphosate [found](https://www.kialo.com/should-the-sale-of-genetically-modified-food-be-banned-17715/17715.0=17715.1+17715.205+17715.529) in Canada's cereals, pastas and cookies.
1.9.7.4.7.3.1. Con: Glyphosate use is not intrinsically linked to GMOs. GMOs can be grown without glyphosate, just like traditional crops can be grown without pesticides.
1.9.7.4.7.4. Pro: The WHO’s cancer research agency [IARC](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/widely-used-herbicide-linked-to-cancer/) has found glyphosate to be a probable cause of cancer.
1.9.7.4.7.4.1. Con: Most experts and regulatory authorities [do not](https://monsanto.com/company/media/statements/glyphosate-report-response/) classify glyphosate as a carcinogen.
1.9.7.4.7.4.1.1. Pro: Some [examples](https://monsanto.com/company/media/statements/glyphosate-report-response/) of organisations which do not classify glyphosate as a carcinogen include, but are not limited to: the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the European Chemical Agency, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the Japan Food Safety Commission.
1.9.7.4.8. Pro: Countless [studies](http://earthopensource.org/gmomythsandtruths/sample-page/3-health-hazards-gm-foods/3-1-myth-gm-foods-safe-eat/) show that GM foods can be toxic, allergenic, or have unintended nutritional changes.
1.9.7.4.8.1. Con: -> See 1.9.4.1.
1.9.7.4.8.2. Pro: Some genetically modified foods may have [higher levels of toxicity](https://www.shape.com/healthy-eating/diet-tips/possible-health-risks-gmos-gmo-foods). The process of genetic modification itself can create or increase toxins and anti-nutrients. For example, genetically modified soybeans were found to have double the normal amount of soy lectin, which can block nutrient absorption.
1.9.7.4.8.2.1. Con: The same risk applies to traditionally cultivated breeds. [Example: Lenape Potato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenape_potato)
1.9.7.4.8.3. Pro: Opponents of genetically modified crops claim that increased consumption of genetically modified crops is linked to an increase in [food allergies](https://responsibletechnology.org/genetically-engineered-foods-may-cause-rising-food-allergies-part-one/).
1.9.7.4.8.3.1. Con: A claim needs stronger evidence than weak attempts at drawing correlations. Genetically modified crops [are no more likely](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gmoanswers/2016/04/18/are-gmos-causing-food-allergies/#5298d0fa431e) to cause allergies than their "natural" or organic counterparts.
1.9.7.4.8.3.2. Pro: A study from the New England Journal of Medicine showed that when Soybeans were genetically modified to include genes from Brazil nuts, the resulting genetically modified Soybeans contained [2s albumin](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Identification-of-a-Brazil-nut-allergen-in-Nordlee-Taylor/90b40e8997a011f5b4b038d459db940d7d60faf6), an allergen derived from the Brazil nuts.
1.9.7.4.8.3.2.1. Con: Genetically modified Soybeans that contain the allergen 2s albumin were [not](https://grist.org/food/genetic-engineering-vs-natural-breeding-whats-the-difference/) commercially released since testing revealed the presence of allergens. This demonstrates that existing testing procedures are adequate and ensure that only safe genetically modified products are made available to consumers.
1.9.7.4.8.3.3. Con: Prior to release all genetically modified foods are subjected to [in vitro tests and in silico tests](https://grist.org/food/genetically-engineered-food-allergic-to-regulations/) that test for the presence of allergens. These tests are able to identify any substance contained within the genetically modified food which resembles known human allergens. Genetically modified products that fail these tests are not released.
1.9.7.4.8.4. Pro: The [American Academy of Environmental Medicine \(AAEM\)](https://www.aaemonline.org/gmo.php) publicly condemned GMOs as “a serious health risk” and have urged physicians to prescribe non-GMO diets for all patients.
1.9.7.4.8.5. Con: -> See 1.2.6.9.
1.9.7.4.8.6. Con: [Almost all](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-truth-about-genetically-modified-food/) articles that claim that genetically modified foods are unsafe for human consumption have since been [discredited](https://www.nature.com/news/study-linking-gm-maize-to-rat-tumours-is-retracted-1.14268) by [scientists](https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2016/05/gmo-safety-debate-is-over/).
1.9.7.4.8.6.1. Pro: In 2012 the journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology [retracted](https://www.nature.com/news/study-linking-gm-maize-to-rat-tumours-is-retracted-1.14268) an article that claimed that increased consumption of genetically modified maize caused cancer in rats. The article was misleading because of the limited sample size and because the rats used for the study had a known high incidence of cancer regardless of their diet. The study, despite being retracted, is still quoted [online](https://www.motherearthnews.com/natural-health/nutrition/gmo-safety-zmgz13amzsto) by anti genetically modified food activists.
1.9.7.4.8.6.2. Pro: In 1998 Árpád Pusztai claimed that rats fed genetically modified potatoes experienced damage to their immune system, stunted growth and brain damage. The study has since been [discredited](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/science-pusztai-the-verdict-1071729.html). The rats were fed a diet which contained inadequate levels of protein, which caused the rats to develop the health problems that the study falsely attributed to genetically modified potatoes.
1.9.7.4.8.6.3. Con: Scientists that publish articles that criticize genetically modified foods are subjected to [coordinated attacks](https://www.nature.com/scitable/content/gm-crops-battlefield-7287905) on their reputation. This has the effect of stifling debate, and preventing scientists from voicing legitimate concerns about genetically modified foods.
1.9.7.4.8.6.3.1. Pro: Journal articles which claim that genetically modified foods are unsafe could encourage governments and the private sector to be reluctant to support future genetically modified food research. This creates an [incentive](https://www.nature.com/news/2009/090902/full/461027a.html) for scientists that support genetically modified foods to unfairly dismiss research that opposes genetically modified foods.
1.9.7.4.8.6.3.2. Pro: An editor from the Entomological Society of America [said](https://www.nature.com/news/2009/090902/full/461027a.html), "I personally am in favour of GMOs in general.. But I do have problems with the tactics of the large block of scientists who denigrate research by other legitimate scientists in a knee-jerk, partisan, emotional way that is not helpful in advancing knowledge and is outside the ideals of scientific inquiry."
1.9.7.4.8.6.3.3. Con: Anti genetically modified food activists subject scientists who support genetically modified food [to](https://www.nature.com/articles/461875a): bomb threats, harassment of their children, and the destruction of their experiments and property. This also stifles debate since it deters scientists from conducting research.
1.9.7.4.8.6.3.3.1. Pro: In 2017 a Monsanto Research Center in Italy was [bombed](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/bomb-attack-damages-monsanto-research-center-italy) by anti genetically modified crops activists. Hundreds of thousands of euros worth of damage was caused.
1.9.7.4.8.6.3.3.2. Pro: In 1992 members of the Earth Liberation Front used [firebombs](https://eu.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2017/02/23/ecoterrorist-rodney-coronado-firebombing-msu/98295732/) to [destroy](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/harvest/etc/synopsis.html) a building that was used for agricultural research at the University of Michigan.
1.9.7.4.8.6.3.3.3. Pro: Anti genetically modified activists have [posted](https://foodscienceinstitute.com/2015/09/01/gmo-opponents-stoop-to-near-terrorism/) online the names and home addresses of scientists who they believe have conspired with biotech companies to advocate for genetically modified foods. The intention behind this is to make scientists fear for their safety and to pressure them to not support genetically modified foods.
1.9.7.4.8.6.3.3.4. Pro: Research organisations that work with genetically modified foods spend [large sums](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/11/11/uk-research-facility-spent-over-2-5-million-to-protect-gmo-wheat-trial-from-threatened-vandalism-by-anti-gmo-activists/) of money on security to protect their experiments from acts of vandalism by anti genetically modified food activists. This reduces the amount of money available for research.
1.9.7.4.8.6.3.3.5. Pro: In 2012, the journal of GM Crops and Food published an article that compiled acts of vandalism committed against genetically modified food trials within Europe. The article identified around [80](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/gmcr.21231?scroll=top&needAccess=true) instances in which GMO trials conducted by academic or governmental research institutes in Europe had been destroyed.
1.9.7.4.8.6.3.4. Con: Papers that critique genetically modified foods which contain bad science should be refuted, otherwise they might exert a disproportionate [influence](https://www.nature.com/news/2009/090902/full/461027a.html) on public policy and opinion.
1.9.7.4.8.6.3.4.1. Pro: A campaign based on flawed science [delayed](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/golden-rice-opponents-should-be-held-accountable-for-health-problems-linked-to-vitamain-a-deficiency/) the introduction of golden rice. A large number of [preventable](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environment-and-development-economics/article/economic-power-of-the-golden-rice-opposition/F31EE0E5B6044B86B5223FF20C409158) deaths and disabilities have occurred as a result of this.
1.9.7.4.8.6.3.5. Con: Pro genetically modified foods researchers should critique the work of those who they disagree with. That is how scientific knowledge advances. It is misleading to characterize this process as an attempt to 'stifle debate' or a 'coordinated attack'.
1.9.7.4.8.6.3.6. Pro: [Ignacio Chapela](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people/ignacio-chapela) is a professor at the University of Berkeley who wrote a paper that claimed that genes from genetically modified crops could contaminate wild species. There is evidence that suggests biotech company [Syngenta](https://www.syngenta.co.uk/) [pressured Berkeley](https://grist.org/food/is-extremism-in-defense-of-gm-food-a-vice/) to not give Chapela tenure. There is also evidence that suggests that biotech firm [Monsanta](https://monsanto.com/) hired a [PR company](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Bivings_Group) to covertly [spread smears](https://www.monbiot.com/2002/05/14/the-fake-persuaders/) about Chapela on popular biotech listservers that were used by prominent scientists.
1.9.7.4.8.6.4. Pro: Greenpeace [falsely](https://www.nature.com/articles/461875a) claimed that children could be poisoned by excess vitamin A intake if they ate golden rice. The source of vitamin A in golden rice is beta carotene. Beta carotene consists of 2 bound vitamin A molecules. The human body [only](https://intpolicydigest.org/2014/02/18/sorry-greenpeace-golden-rice-is-a-win-for-nutrition-and-health/) splits beta carotene into vitamin A when it requires it.
1.9.7.4.8.6.5. Pro: The Institute for Responsible Technology claimed that glyphosate found on genetically modified foods caused Celiac disease since: " Glyphosate is a patented antibiotic that destroys beneficial gut bacteria. An imbalance of gut flora commonly accompanies Celiac Disease and other gluten-related disorders." [This is false](https://celiac.org/main/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-04.pdf). Glyphosate levels present on genetically modified foods are too low to alter gut bacteria in the way the report stated.
1.9.7.4.9. Pro: The increased use of genetically modified food may result in increased [antibiotic resistance.](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/fury-as-eu-approves-gm-potato-1915833.html)
1.9.7.4.9.1. Pro: Antibiotic resistance marker genes are used in genetic modification of plants. There is some concern that this might cause bacteria to develop [resistance](http://enhs.umn.edu/current/5103/gm/harmful.html) to antibiotics.
1.9.7.4.9.1.1. Pro: Some genetically modified crops contain genes which are associated with antibiotic resistance. When a genetically modified crop is eaten, there is a risk that these genes could enter bacteria in the gastro-intestinal tract of humans. These bacteria could then [develop resistance](https://www.government.nl/topics/biotechnology/antibiotic-resistant-genes) to antibiotics.
1.9.7.4.9.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.4.2.1.1.1.1.
1.9.7.4.9.2. Con: Genetically modified crops which increase the risks of antibiotic resistance developing would [not be approved](https://www.government.nl/topics/biotechnology/antibiotic-resistant-genes) for use in practice.
1.10. Con: In a free market economy, banning an entire industry based on possible harms when this conclusion is insufficiently supported is unjust since a lot of other proven harmful products are available on the market.
1.10.1. Pro: Cigarettes are still available on the market with labels despite the fact that they are proven to be [unhealthy](https://www.nhs.uk/smokefree/why-quit/smoking-health-problems).
1.10.2. Pro: Weapons manufacturing and export is one of the [biggest](https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/world/weapons-sales-in-2016-exceeded-the-total-gdp-of-all-but-26-of-the-worlds-nations-818241.html) industries in the world and many countries are deeply reliant upon them.
1.10.3. Pro: Fast food is legal even though it causes [obesity](https://universityhealthnews.com/daily/nutrition/fast-food-and-obesity-the-cold-hard-facts/) and other long term health problems.
1.10.4. Con: Allowing products into the food supply without proper testing for long term effects on human health and the environment is reckless and akin to claims decades ago about cigarettes being healthy.
1.10.5. Con: It is the voter-mandated mission of governments and their agencies to ensure safeguards against products that may cause harms to citizens.
1.10.6. Con: Just because other dangerous products are still on the market does not mean that potentially harmful GMO food should also remain available for consumers.
1.11. Pro: -> See 1.9.7.4.
1.12. Con: Genetically modified crops are better for the environment.
1.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.12.2. Con: While genetically modified crop creators like Monsanto promised they would decrease herbicide use, they have vastly [increased the use of glyphosate](https://www.ewg.org/agmag/2016/03/are-gmos-bad-environment), the active ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide.
1.12.3. Con: Farmers who plant herbicide-resistant genetically modified crops often use a limited range of herbicides on their fields, which can give rise to [herbicide-resistant "superweeds"](https://www.vox.com/cards/genetically-modified-foods/are-gmo-crops-good-or-bad-for-the-environment).
1.12.3.1. Pro: The presence of "superweeds" increases the costs associated with farming. This can significantly affect farmers' [profit margins](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/people-and-culture/food/the-plate/2016/05/17/scientists-say-gmo-foods-are-safe-public-skepticism-remains/).
1.12.4. Pro: Genetically modified crops can be grown in a [wider range of locations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4560252/). This may make it possible to grow more food locally, and thus, reduce the carbon footprint associated with food transportation.
1.12.5. Pro: Genetically modifying crops so that they can fix atmospheric nitrogen would result in crops that require [less fertilizer](https://www.iaea.org/topics/improving-soil-fertility) to grow.
1.12.5.1. Pro: Using less fertilizer decreases the chances of [eutrophication](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/eutrophication-causes-consequences-and-controls-in-aquatic-102364466) occurring.
1.12.5.2. Pro: The presence of chemicals from fertilizer in drinking water is linked to an [increased rate](https://www.environment.co.za/environmental-issues/how-do-fertilizers-affect-the-environment.html) of blue baby syndrome, cancer and other chronic diseases. Using less fertilizer decreases the risk of chemicals from fertilizers contaminating drinking water consumed by humans.
1.12.5.2.1. Con: Organic amendment-heavy techniques build soil life and decrease the amount of nutrients needed immensely already without limiting the ability as to what is grown.
1.12.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.
1.12.6. Pro: Banning genetically modified crops will cause pesticides and other chemical pest repellents to become the mainstay in crop loss prevention.
1.12.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.
1.12.6.2. Pro: Bt corn, cotton and soy have in some cases led to [decreased](https://pknewby.com/2012/11/06/faqs-on-gmos-what-the-science-says/) use of pesticides and herbicides, which in turn reduces agricultural run-off and improves water quality, in addition to reducing chemical exposures among farm workers. This good would be undone if GMOs were banned.
1.12.7. Pro: Genetically modifying fruit so that they are [less prone](https://www.arcticapples.com/arctic-apples-r/arctic-apples-benefits/) to bruising results in less fruit being thrown away.
1.12.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.
1.12.8. Con: [Studies show](https://news.utexas.edu/2018/09/24/common-weed-killer-linked-to-bee-deaths) glyphosate found in Monsanto's Round-up is directly linked to the dying off of bees.
1.12.9. Con: [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/20338) published a study that suggested that pollen from genetically modified Bt corn caused high mortality rates in monarch butterfly caterpillars. This was an unintended side effect of genetic modification.
1.12.9.1. Pro: The [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/20338) suggested that crops which are genetically modified to be resistant to pests, do not only kill pest insects, they also [indiscriminately](https://biomed.brown.edu/arise/resources/docs/GM%20foods%20review.pdf) kill many species of insect larvae. \(p.5\)
1.12.9.2. Con: Researchers have since [refuted](https://www.nature.com/news/2001/010912/full/news010913-12.html) the notion that genetically modified Bt corn was responsible for the death of monarch butterfly caterpillars: "The research finds that pollen from the varieties of Bt corn most commonly grown in the United States do not contain enough toxin to harm monarchs, and that the crop is not grown widely enough to pose a significant risk."
1.12.10. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.5.
1.12.11. Con: The [Environmental Biosafety Research Journal](https://www.ebr-journal.org/) published a paper that demonstrated that genetically modified Bt corn that contained a gene called 'event 176' caused increased [mortality](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.872.6960&rep=rep1&type=pdf) in the black swallowtail butterfly population.
1.12.11.1. Con: This variety of Bt corn known as 'KnockOut' has since been [withdrawn](https://www.nature.com/news/2001/010912/full/news010913-12.html) by its manufacturer.
1.12.12. Pro: [Genetically modified crops decrease inefficient land usage](https://medium.com/\@debunkingdenialism/five-ways-gmos-benefit-the-environment-c48eee7e2765). They increase yield whereas organic farming decreases yield by 34%, so they require substantially less land than conventional and organic farming to grow the same amount of food.
1.12.12.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.12.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.
1.12.13. Pro: Tilling is a weed-management method, but it also removes nutrients from the soil, causes more erosion and run-off, and harms earthworms, etc. People who farm genetically modified crops do not need to till their soil as often because many of these crops are herbicide resistant, reducing the damage tilling can cause.
1.12.13.1. Con: [Tilling is not a hard requirement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-till_farming) for farming non GMO produce. A [number of farms](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Highlights/2014/Highlights_Conservation.pdf) are supporting less mainstream methods of land management that reduce or eliminate the need to till.
1.12.14. Pro: [GE](http://pknewby.com/2012/11/06/faqs-on-gmos-what-the-science-says/) crops can safeguard natural resources by reducing soil erosion, improving air quality and conserving arable land.
