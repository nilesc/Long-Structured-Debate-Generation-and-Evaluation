Discussion Title: Should Human Reproduction be Limited To No More Than One Offspring Per Person?

1. Human reproduction should be limited to no more than 1 offspring per person.
1.1. Con: It's immoral to regulate reproductive rights in any capacity.
1.1.1. Con: The coming shifts in climate and sea level as a result of high and increasing population numbers will most harm the world’s poor, who are least responsible for the atmosphere’s composition, and will least harm the wealthy, who bear the biggest responsibility. Not taking effective action would be immoral in itself.
1.2. Pro: Producing one child per person would lower the global human population over time, meaning a gradual decrease in resource consumption.
1.2.1. Con: Decreasing the human population through this method would result in increasing [population aging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing). With the ratio between productive members of society and dependent members \(elderly\) moving in this direction actual availability of resources \(made available through labor\) would be decreasing at possibly a faster rate then consumption, in effect increasing relative pressure on available resources.
1.2.2. Con: Current consumption numbers per capita show that on average nations with low population growth consume more per capita then nations with high population growth; for example, oil consumption in India compared to U.S. [oil](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Energy/Oil/Consumption/Per-capita) [population growth rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_growth_rate)
1.2.3. Con: We have more then enough resources to feed, clothe and satisfy the human population. We lack a way to evenly distribute our resources. The world could easily survive if we adopted a different style of consumption, if we universally adopted the American rate of consumption we would require three planets. Overpopulation is not the problem, over-consumption and inequality is.
1.2.4. Pro: Given that the average in the US is [1.9 children/family](https://www.statista.com/statistics/718084/average-number-of-own-children-per-family/), and the 2.4 children/family statistic is well known for the UK, the impact on overpopulation would be huge and immediate.
1.3. Con: The US has a fertility rate of 1.8 births per female, which is similar to many other advanced economies.  Limiting reproduction seems like a solution in search of a problem.
1.4. Pro: Curbing reproduction is more humane and ethical than other forms of population control.
1.4.1. Con: A more ethical way to reduce the total population on earth would be to export humans to colonize space in great numbers.
1.4.1.1. Con: This is a good idea, but a long way off. As such, it is necessary to consider intermediary ideas.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Some experts believe a moon colony could be established in as little as [six years](https://futurism.com/when-will-the-first-human-space-colony-be-established/).
1.4.2. Con: A more humane way of adopting an inhumane policy is not an achievement. Killing someone quickly is no better then killing them slowly, they are just as dead. Population control is innately immoral, therefore the means used to reach this immoral end are irrelevant.
1.4.2.1. Con: It is not an immoral end. It is actually the most moral end imaginable, trying to preserve and continue the human race without lives being lost; instead, they are prevented from occurring, thus not causing deaths.
1.5. Pro: This formula would allow for two children per couple, meaning there is less chance of parents ending up childless in old age should an accident or illness strike their offspring.
1.5.1. Pro: Being the only offspring puts more burden on the children.
1.5.2. Con: This isn't noticeably less than [current contemporary rates](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11806379/End-of-2.4-children-as-Britain-has-biggest-families-in-Europe.html) of childbirth in developed countries.
1.6. Con: If this were to become government policy, it would be incredibly difficult to regulate.
1.6.1. Con: While any legal prohibition can and will be broken, no law is enforced with a 100% success rate. China's one child policy [shows](http://mentalfloss.com/article/29647/how-does-china-enforce-its-one-baby-policy) that reproduction can be successfully regulated by governments to produce desired results.
1.6.2. Pro: Having twins or triplets as the result of a second pregnancy to the same couple would mean they have exceeded their reproductive limit.
1.6.2.1. Con: Medical science provides ways for detecting this during pregnancy and then correct via abortion.
1.7. Con: Couples who are poor and/or have limited access to birth control would be disadvantaged.
1.7.1. Con: Money saved by these couples not having children to pay for is much greater then the costs of birth control.
1.7.2. Pro: In poor countries, having children is the only way to survive when getting old, as there is no pension and the children can look after their parents.
1.8. Con: In places with currently high population growth, a sudden introduction of this policy would result in population ageing and economic stagnation.
1.8.1. Pro: Results of the 'one child' policy in China would [support](https://www.copsmodels.com/ftp/workpapr/g-191.pdf) this claim. The policy was enacted to curb explosive population growth in 1979 and in 2013 it was relaxed in reaction to current demographic projections showing a quick increase in labor deficit.
1.8.2. Pro: Throughout history, dramatic changes to reproduction levels have resulted in increased strain on society, one way or another. A mandate that is suddenly enforced, would be quite disastrous.
1.9. Pro: Families with fewer children are often better off financially than those with many mouths to feed.
1.9.1. Con: Financial incentives is not why humans live. Children are not just 'mouths to feed'; they are lives with intrinsic value who add love and joy to the lives of parents. It seems unwise to substitute the lifetime joy a child can bring in exchange for more cash. Happiness and love are far more reasonable aims in life then money alone.
1.9.2. Pro: Raising fewer children allows parents to invest more in their education and upbringing.
