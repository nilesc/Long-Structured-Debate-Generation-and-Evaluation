Discussion Title: The Vegan Alternative: Pain-free GM Animals?

1. Genetically modifying livestock so that they don't feel pain is a viable alternative to veganism for reducing animal suffering.
1.1. Con: Farming without pain is already possible without genetically modifying.
1.1.1. Pro: Low density farming is already possible, and humane slaughter methods are significantly less painful than what an animal experiences in the wild.
1.1.1.1. Con: Low-density farming is not viable in terms of meeting global demand, both in terms of quantity and price to the consumer.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: If we do only only low-density farming, supply will be lower, price to the customer will go higher, eventually demand will be reduced and meat would become a luxury product \(imagine a world where the only meat available is iberic pork and Kobe beef\), available only to the wealthiest. But that wouldn't be so bad for mankind as our needs for meat are not as high as demand in the Western world.
1.1.1.2. Con: Less painful than in the wild is still more painful than the experience of an animal genetically modified to not feel pain.
1.1.2. Con: Ultimately every animal must be killed, therefore there can never be a pain free existence.
1.1.2.1. Con: Pain is not synonymous with death.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: An animal that dies under anesthesia would feel no pain.
1.1.3. Pro: Factory farmed animals \(except halal animals\) are killed in a quick and painless way.
1.2. Con: Genetically modifying animals for slaughter is unethical.
1.2.1. Pro: Altering these animals is an animal welfare concern, as it requires the sacrifice of some using [invasive surgical procedures](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078015/#__sec7title) such as vasectomies and surgical embryo transfers.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Reduced pain doesn’t equal good welfare.
1.2.2. Pro: The use of animals in research for the purpose of modification has increased, violating one of the three 'R's of ethics-[reduction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078015/#__sec7title).
1.2.3. Pro: Many of the animals in genetic research are euthanized after they can no longer be utilized, which makes these animals mere objects to be used and thrown away.
1.2.3.1. Con: This is also true of many of medicines' greatest advances, but it does not mean we should avoid short term discomfort to forfeit long term goals.
1.2.4. Pro: Modifying humans is immoral. Animals deserve the same morality.
1.2.4.1. Pro: If we genetically modified people not to feel pain, would that make it ok to murder them? This is not about the pain, it's about the act of taking a life. Life is full of pain in general.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: The loss of a person is felt by society. The connections and value the person brings are lost once a person dies.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: Non-human animals also [grieve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_grief) the loss of members of their society.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: Often, persons sentenced to the death penalty are given anesthetic drugs before being killed. One could argue that this shows that some humans approve of taking human life when the person being killed feels no pain.
1.2.4.2. Pro: There are already humans thats can't feel pain. if you wouldn't eat them then you should answer no to this suggestion.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: [CIPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain_with_anhidrosis) is a rare human genetic disorder in which the afflicted person does not feel pain. It would not be ethically acceptable to abuse or kill a person afflicted with this disorder. Applying the same metric to animals, it would not be ethical to subject an animal that cannot feel pain to abuse or slaughter.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: The same metric cannot be applied to animals, as it wouldn't be ethical to slaughter humans for food or to keep them housed in very poor conditions.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: Cannibalism is illegal, whereas consuming animals is currently legal. The two are not interchangeable in this argument for this reason, despite personal opinion.
1.2.4.3. Con: This is a point of view, and not a factual statement.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: Ethical statements are actually statements of \(ethical\) facts \(for example, "murder is wrong" is an ethical fact.\).
1.2.4.4. Pro: The same kind of genetic modification might be used to justify other forms of abuse in the name of easing suffering, while the real motivation is less altruistic. Allowing humans to be genetically modified to withstand harsher working conditions for the sake of increasing production and profits for corporations would be considered unethical.
1.2.4.5. Con: Gene therapy for humans is well accepted by the medical community as ethical.
1.2.5. Pro: The physical GM of animals in production through the [CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) is already on a slippery slope. To now  start altering them neurologically is a step too far in the God complex.
1.2.5.1. Con: There is nothing inherently wrong with going against natural selection and evolution. The process would likely be similar to gene therapy and in-vitro fertilization already done in humans.
1.2.6. Con: Genetically modifying humans or animals to reduce suffering from disease would generally be considered humane.  If the meat industry is status quo, it is important to reduce suffering of animals here too.
1.2.7. Con: Genetically modifying stock would be a short term process, accomplished in a couple of decades, with long term animal welfare benefits spanning potentially thousands of years.
1.2.8. Con: Ethical considerations are not the primary motivator in human economic systems.
1.2.9. Con: GMO can risk human health, as this field is not as developed yet to ensure it is risk free.
1.2.10. Con: If it is less "unethical" than not modifying them then it could still be a viable alternative.
1.2.11. Con: Selective breeding has already genetically modified animals that are to be slaughtered. Modification, in the abstract, is not inherently unethical. Specific goals of modification must be examined to make that judgement.
1.2.11.1. Con: It could be argued that [selective breeding](http://www.dummies.com/home-garden/hobby-farming/raising-chickens/health-problems-unique-to-chickens-raised-for-meat/) is also unethical.
1.3. Pro: People can still enjoy meat.
1.3.1. Con: Genetically modifying animals so that they don't feel pain could never be an alternative to veganism, it would still be a form of exploitation.
1.3.2. Con: The public is unlikely to accept genetically-modified animals.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Many people are already opposed to genetically modified food/plants. GM animals would pose the same skepticism.
1.3.2.2. Con: Public sentiment does not always reflect public buying behavior.
1.3.2.3. Con: A case has yet to be made for this to the public. With the proper education, the public may decide its a good idea.
1.3.2.4. Con: People would be willing to eat genetically engineered food if it meant they were no longer responsible for suffering and if it did not impose too much of a burden on their lives. [link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12152-009-9048-6)
1.3.2.5. Con: Modern factory farming already feeds animals unnatural diets, unnatural hormones in an unnatural environment. Genetic modification, while unnatural, is not too different from current practices.
1.3.2.5.1. Con: People are generally much more afraid of GMOs, because they are so new
1.3.2.5.2. Con: Current practices are [harmful](http://naturalsociety.com/factory-farms-bad-farm-animals-humans/) to both humans and animals. This should not be the standards adhered to just for the consumption of meat.
1.3.2.5.3. Pro: The [diet](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/corn/background.aspx) of a factory-farmed animal mainly consists of corn, sorghum, oats, and barley which is not a natural diet for these animals.
1.3.2.5.4. Pro: Many farmers use [unnatural hormones](http://www.businessinsider.com/farmers-fatten-cattle-hormone-implants-2016-4) like Zilmax and bovine somatotropin \(bST\) to speed up the growth process so their cattle are ready for slaughter quicker.
1.3.2.5.4.1. Pro: Cows given bovine somatotropin have an increase in [mastitis](https://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/8-shocking-facts-bovine-growth-hormone/), infecting and inflaming the mammary tissue. This can be painful. Genetically modifying cows not to feel this discomfort will be beneficial.
1.3.2.6. Pro: Most Americans are [unfamiliar](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/12/01/public-opinion-about-genetically-modified-foods-and-trust-in-scientists-connected-with-these-foods/) with GMO foods in general. However, those with the most knowledge see them as health risks. Its likely the more people know, the less accepting they will be.
1.3.3. Pro: Everyone does not want to be vegan.
1.3.4. Pro: Veganism is unnatural for humans. The human brain evolved way beyond any other species because we learned to cook and eat both meat and greens.[amp.timeinc.net](http://amp.timeinc.net/time/4252373/meat-eating-veganism-evolution)
1.3.5. Pro: Many people go vegan for the ethics of animals, not because they do not like eating meat. If these animals did not feel pain, it is likely that some vegans would revert back to eating meat.
1.3.5.1. Con: Livestock not feeling pain will not justify the other forms of inhumanity associated with eating meat.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: It isn't just about the pain animals feel. Many vegans are not in support of animals being held captive and killed for human consumption. Thus, it is likely they will still not support genetically modifying them.
1.3.5.1.1.1. Pro: Some vegans feel a moral obligation to equalize the treatment animals receive. Killing them for any purpose is thus seen as murder. Modifying their pain threshold will not change this perspective.
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: Environmental damage from livestock effects people negatively. Livestock should not be kept around due to this reason whether they feel pain or not.
1.3.5.1.3. Pro: When people see animals mistreated \(such as raised for consumption\) as acceptable, they might end up mistreating animals that are not GM'd to not feel pain.
1.3.5.1.4. Con: Livestock not feeling pain is a step in the right direction towards a more humane world. Progress can be made in the future towards the other injustices after genetically modifying livestock.
1.3.5.2. Pro: An Australian [survey](https://vomadlife.com/blogs/news/why-most-people-go-vegan-2016-survey-results-reveal-all) found that many people \(mostly women\) go vegan because they do not support animal suffering.
1.3.5.2.1. Con: While the avoidance of animal suffering is the stereotype of veganism, objectively, that is not the most compelling argument for veganism. In order for an alternative to be viable, addressing environmental and health concerns would go a long way for the growing number of vegans, who express alternative reasons for their choices  like their personal health and the environment.
1.4. Con: There are many meat alternatives that make altering animals in this way unnecessary.
1.4.1. Pro: There is no case for altering animals' biology when plant-based meat analogues are so realistic that many carnists can't tell the difference.
1.4.1.1. Pro: [Beyond Meat](http://beyondmeat.com/), for example, is a plant-based meat substitute that cooks and looks much like beef. It has already garnered [interest](http://www.businessinsider.com/review-of-beyond-meat-veggie-burger-that-bleeds-2016-5) from vegans and meat eaters alike.
1.4.1.2. Con: Plant-based meat analogues have a long way to go before they can mimic the exact flavor and texture of meat. They are very pricy \(~ twice the price of meat\), and an effective Beyond Meat equivalent for other meats is yet to be produced.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: Meat is so much cheaper because it comes from a heavily subsidized and well-established industry. If the government were to subsidize vegetarian alternatives instead, money would not be an issue for the consumer.
1.4.1.3. Con: Some people have unhealthy reactions to wheat-gluten and/or soy, so most plant-based meat analogues are not viable for them.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: There are many [other meat alternatives](https://www.peta.org/living/food/guide-soy-gluten-free-meatless-meat/) that are soy, wheat, and gluten free.
1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: These are expensive and not widely available when compared with factory farmed meats.
1.4.2. Pro: Livestock is not needed in the first place. Cultured "lab-grown" meat - like those offered by [Memphis Meats](http://www.memphismeats.com/) - are a more viable and ethical alternative.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Lab-grown meat is also being developed in Holland, and [it seems to be healthier and more friendly towards the environment than conventional meat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/lab-grown-meat-is-in-your-future-and-it-may-be-healthier-than-the-real-stuff/2016/05/02/aa893f34-e630-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d6e9f163bf5c).
1.4.3. Con: Many meat alternatives are heavily processed, and therefore unhealthy to consume.
1.4.3.1. Pro: [Many meat substitutes](https://dailyburn.com/life/health/vegetarian-tofurky-meat-substitutes/) contain high amounts of sodium and chemicals in order to achieve the right texture and similar taste. These additives in some cases are less healthy than eating meat itself.
1.4.4. Con: The root argument is that pain-free animals would be a viable alternative, not that it would be particularly preferable or necessary.
1.4.5. Pro: Humans have no physical need to eat meat, its a personal choice. So for vegans, it is not a viable alternative.
1.4.6. Pro: Growing artificial meat from stem cells removes removes pain altogether, is already achieved and economically viable, whereas growing pain-free animals requires a great amount of research, with inevitably occurring failed attempts leading to more animal suffering.
1.5. Con: Physical pain is not the only way by which an organism can suffer.
1.5.1. Pro: Though there is no physical pain, there is still significant degradation
1.5.2. Pro: Animals may feel discomfort due to illness and disease that can happen in factory farming.
1.5.2.1. Con: Animals in husbandry are well fed and medicated, their quality of life is significantly better than wild counterparts.
1.5.2.2. Pro: Fatigue, nausea, emotional distress, impaired mobility, impaired sight, impaired hearing, and other problems which might not be painful should be considered suffering.
1.5.3. Pro: What makes eating animals wrong is not just that it makes animals feel pain, but also that it kills them.
1.5.4. Pro: Pain is not the only factor in the morality of using sentient beings in any way. Sentience includes, but is not limited to, subjective experience of life and pain is just a part of this experience. The basic inviolable rights of sentient beings does not only boil down to the suffering/pain, but to the notion that animals have the right to live a free life.
1.5.5. Pro: The removal of pain does not remove cognitive faculties such as proprioception, anticipation, or the emotional response of fear. Modifying animals to be pain free would not be sufficient assurance of non suffering.
1.5.6. Pro: This solves suffering, but not taking a life.
1.5.7. Pro: Animals may still suffer emotional distress under this process.
1.5.7.1. Pro: Livestock will still lose their herds and families, baby calves are taken away from their mothers.. this pain is probably worse for a mother than their slaughter.
1.5.8. Pro: There is no pain involved in solitary confinement but we consider it a relatively harsh punishment.
1.5.8.1. Pro: Solitary treatment is known to cause [brain damage](http://solitarywatch.com/2016/05/11/isolation-devastates-the-brain-the-neuroscience-of-solitary-confinement/).
1.5.8.2. Con: Emotional pain can be an outcome of solitary confinement and can be an integral part of the punishment's design.
1.5.8.3. Pro: There is no pain in boredom, and yet it is unpleasant.
1.5.8.3.1. Pro: Denial of an organisms pleasure as well as autonomy are major components of the cruelty.
1.5.9. Con: Pain is one of the largest factors in these animal's existence. To rid them of this is a step in the right direction, even if it does not eliminate all suffering.
1.5.9.1. Pro: Animals are already suffering in the industry. If modifying their pain threshold does not cause more suffering, then it is a positive move, even if it's not perfect.
1.5.9.1.1. Pro: Farm factory animals live in [cramped](https://livestockbxe.wordpress.com/living-conditions/) inhumane quarters, that have been documented to cause severed limbs \(in chickens\), and other painful issues. Modifying their pain is thus a more humane way for them to exist under these conditions.
1.5.9.1.1.1. Con: While this would be more humane, it would still not make factory farming a morally acceptable practice.
1.5.9.1.1.1.1. Pro: Factory farming forces animals into a life not worth living. They are crammed, fed or force fed terrible food in some cases, and separated from their young.
1.5.9.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Animals fed a diet high in waste are [susceptible](http://naturalsociety.com/factory-farms-bad-farm-animals-humans/) to illness and disease. This would mean humans would have to consume diseased animal products which would not be healthy.
1.5.9.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Genetic modification can help animals become more resistant to diseases and viruses.
1.5.9.1.1.1.2. Con: Morality is subjective, and while Vegans hold that animals have an equal right to life and care, many people do not hold this view. To those people, any form of farming is morally acceptable.
1.5.9.1.1.2. Con: It would be easier and more ethical to not continue the inhumane mistreatment of animals than genetically modifying them to endure it without pain.
1.5.9.1.2. Con: Some animal subjects used to test this process will likely suffer in the process, putting more animals under harm than necessary. Therefore, modifying these animals causes more suffering in order to attempt to end it.
1.5.9.1.3. Con: If the inability to feel pain leads to more suffering in [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain), the same is likely true for animals.
1.6. Con: Creating animals that don't feel pain is a challenging process in which success cannot be guaranteed.
1.6.1. Pro: The development process would need animal testing. This is challenging and morally questionable in itself.
1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.9.1.2.
1.6.2. Pro: With our current technology, it would be impossible for scientists to be sure that the animals they engineered were truly without pain.
1.6.3. Pro: The research necessary to genetically modify animals would be costly and better allocated to other more pressing issues.
1.6.3.1. Con: If it would work it would reduce lots of suffering from lots of animals. That is a really important issue.
1.6.4. Pro: It goes against natural selection and evolution. Have cloned meat been peer reviewed not to have side-effects in humans? When they [cloned a sheep](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2002/apr/19/genetics.highereducation) for example it suffered old age and died quicker.
1.6.4.1. Con: We aren't necessarily talking about cloning.
1.6.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.6.5. Con: Science and technology can be challenging, but without trying one cannot know if there is a possibility of success or not.
1.6.6. Pro: We don't even have a solid grasp on how pain works in humans, who can tell us. Animals would be powerless to accurately tell us if something was wrong.
1.6.6.1. Con: There have been many [scientific studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK219252/) on pain in animals. The same assessments could be used.
1.6.6.1.1. Pro: Scientists know the [exact mutation](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/congenital-insensitivity-to-pain#genes) that causes pain insensitivity in humans.
1.6.7. Con: Success for any new process is not guaranteed. However, if more animals are helped in the long term than it is worth the few who may suffer to get there.
1.6.8. Pro: -> See 1.5.9.1.2.
1.7. Pro: GMO animals will feel less fear if pain is reduced.
1.7.1. Con: Physically feeling less fear will not help the emotional fear experienced by animals going through the slaughter process. This just eliminates the ability to physically respond to such fear.
1.7.1.1. Con: Animals do not know they are going to die when they enter the slaughter house, no predator is visible, only humans to which the animal is accustomed, emotional fear is minimal.
1.7.2. Pro: It has been shown that reduced [pain](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/026a/7a90da68b8bc09202d70ceb60aa345e3d429.pdf) threshold reduces fear.
1.7.3. Pro: Most livestock must be transported and this often induces fear that could be avoided if they were pain free.
1.7.4. Con: Fear has been shown to be a helpful mechanism in reducing pain. [Hypoalgesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoalgesia) is an interruption in painful stimuli that can occur when the body is in the presence of opioids, chemicals produced when in fear. Thus, fear has been shown to be a helpful mechanism in reducing pain.
1.7.4.1. Con: If an organism is modified not to feel pain then Hypoalgesia is irrelevant since the animal isn't feeling pain anyway.
1.8. Pro: Animal agriculture farmers and associated jobs will not be lost.
1.8.1. Con: The industry of animal agriculture is frowned upon by many vegans. jobs being lost in this industry would be a good thing.
1.9. Con: There are many benefits to veganism which go beyond reducing animal suffering.
1.9.1. Pro: A Vegan diet has less impact on the Environment.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Meat production is wasteful, polluting, and unsustainable.
1.9.1.1.1. Pro: [Two-thirds](http://www.environmentreports.com/change-your-diet-change-our-destiny/) of all crop calories produced in the US are used for animal feed. This depletes a lot of soil and takes up a lot of land to maintain.
1.9.1.1.1.1. Pro: It takes 6.7 pounds of grains and forage, 52.8 gallons of water, 74.5 square feet of land, 1,036 btus of fossil fuel energy to produce [1 quarter pound beef burger](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/02/11/514544431/saving-the-planet-one-burger-at-a-time-this-juicy-patty-is-meat-free).
1.9.1.1.2. Pro: Beef, in particular, produces [more pollutants than the use of cars does](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/21/giving-up-beef-reduce-carbon-footprint-more-than-cars).
1.9.1.2. Con: Animals who don't feel pain can be killed at a younger age, such as a calf which costs a lot less environmentally than a cow.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: Animals are not killed later in life due to pain, but due to their size. Calves would not have enough meat to be worth killing.
1.9.1.3. Con: Animals that do not feel pain can be cramped up and fed waste products, turning waste into food. This is good for the environment.
1.9.1.3.1. Con: Pain will be felt by the non-GM'd wildlife affected by raising livestock.
1.9.1.3.1.1. Pro: Raising animals attracts wildlife \(such as wolves to sheep\) and causes tensions between humans and wildlife. When wildlife is seen as a problem, humans retaliate by [killing them](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/27/wolves-shot-mutilated-italy-considers-bringing-back-cull-40/).
1.9.1.3.1.2. Pro: Grazing livestock are [detrimental to aquatic life in nature](https://research.jcu.edu.au/tropwater/resources/00%2001%20Lit%20Rev%20Potential%20Impact%20grazing%20Aquatic%20Ripar%20Eco.pdf).
1.9.1.3.1.3. Pro: Eating animals higher on the food chain \(think of [tuna](http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/87d69400b2330048d8b69e92a7c393f54f32b0db.gif)\) does not reduce the suffering for animals lower on it \(like smaller fish\)
1.9.1.3.1.4. Pro: [Field animals are killed when harvesting grains for livestock](http://www.animalvisuals.org/projects/data/1mc/).
1.9.1.3.1.4.1. Con: Grains for feeding livestock could be made using methods that do not kill as many animals \(such as not using machinery or growing in a greenhouse\).
1.9.1.3.1.5. Pro: [Nutrient pollution from agriculture causes algae blooms that are toxic to the environment](https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/harmful-algal-blooms).
1.9.1.3.1.6. Pro: Global warming from agriculture causes [dead zones in the ocean](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/09/warm-water-pacific-coast-algae-nino/).
1.9.1.3.1.7. Pro: A vegan diet can be made to not harm wildlife \(such as growing in greenhouses\) whereas growing pain-free GM animals inherently cannot \(as the other claims mention\).
1.9.1.3.2. Con: Animals that are fed rubbish would not be suitable for human consumption. Even if they were, the meat would not be high quality.
1.9.1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.9.1.1.1.1.1.
1.9.1.4. Pro: There's a big portion of vegans who don't eat meat for non-ethical reasons like climate change or consumption of water, therefore this is just a partial solution.
1.9.2. Pro: Veganism is about the person, not the animal. For some people the reason not to eat meat is the pain it causes for the animal, but for other people there are different reasons. So GM-animals aren't an alternative which works for everyone.
1.9.3. Con: However people who do not want to be vegan could still assist in reducing animals suffering this way.
1.9.4. Pro: Veganism doesn't aim to simply reduce animal suffering, but also restore animal rights. This includes their autonomy and right not to be sentenced to die.
1.10. Con: There is no way of accurately measuring suffering in an animal.
1.10.1. Con: Existence of pain can be confidently determined even if the accurate amount of pain is uncertain.
1.11. Pro: Not enough people are willing to become vegan to completely eliminate the suffering caused by intensive factory farming.
1.11.1. Pro: Among vegans and vegetarians, eventually [84%](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animals-and-us/201412/84-vegetarians-and-vegans-return-meat-why) return to meat. Thus, even among core supporters people are not willing enough to endure veganism.
1.11.1.1. Con: Statistics show that veganism is on the rise [foodrevolution.org](https://foodrevolution.org/blog/vegan-statistics-global/)
1.11.2. Pro: [58%](http://www.thejournal.ie/lunch-crunch-poll-vegan-3674050-Nov2017/) of online voters at a journal's website indicated they couldn't go vegan.
1.11.2.1. Con: This is not a representative poll that has any significant value.
The poll just asks the question without giving arguments. Many vegans have said "I could never do it" before going vegan.
1.11.2.2. Con: The poll is ongoing since November 2017, people can still vote in it.
1.11.3. Con: The number of people willing to go vegan may change over time.
1.11.3.1. Pro: In Britain alone, the number of [vegans](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/news/number-of-vegans-in-britain-rises-by-360-in-10-years/) has risen 360% over the last 10 years. This boom is likely to continue as consumers become more health conscious.
1.11.3.2. Pro: Attitudes on moral issues have historically changed over time.  For example, on the issue of slavery. Two millennia ago, slavery seemed natural, whilst today it seems unthinkable to most people.
1.11.3.2.1. Con: If livestock no longer feel pain, as proposed in the original claim, this would reduce the number of people who become vegan in order to lessen pain to livestock.
1.11.3.3. Pro: The number of people willing to go vegan is changing rapidly in the western world. The money invested to this will be a waste, as there are already meat alternatives \(lab grown meat\) that will be coming out soon.
1.11.3.3.1. Pro: In the US, [veganism](https://www.plantbasednews.org/post/veganism-skyrockets-by-600-in-america-over-3-years-to-6-of-population) has grown 600% over the last 3 years.
1.11.4. Con: One doesn't have to 'completely' eliminate the suffering caused by intensive factory farming-- any lessening of suffering is a moral payoff, and some people will be willing to make a trade off.
1.12. Pro: This can be done scientifically, whereas veganism requires a change of public opinion. This is arguably more difficult.
1.12.1. Con: This would be an enormous genetic overhaul, far beyond what we can accomplish with modern science and would likely be overkill expense-wise.
1.12.1.1. Pro: It is unlikely that most livestock owners would want to deal with the added complexity of livestock that cannot feel pain.
1.12.1.1.1. Pro: Livestock are often moved using prods \(pain\) and loud noises \(fear\). Livestock that could not feel pain/fear would likely be hard to control/move.
1.12.1.1.2. Pro: Lack of pain awareness often leads to an accumulation of wounds, bruises, broken bones, and other health issues that may go undetected. Human infants with congenital insensitivity to pain [get](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/congenital-insensitivity-to-pain) mouth wounds due to repeated self-biting. These repeated injuries often lead to a reduced life expectancy. Livestock owners are probably not willing to tolerate such 'defects' in their livestock.
1.12.1.1.2.1. Pro: Presumably, livestock, like [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain), would be extremely likely to die at a young age, possibly before they reach the correct age to be slaughtered for food. This would be a nonviable alternative to veganism for a source of food.
1.12.2. Con: Genetically modifying animals not to feel pain for the purpose of eating them may just as well require a change in morality, which may prove to be more challenging than veganism.
1.12.3. Pro: Veganism is a choice made by consumers who have less power than suppliers in rapid change to an industry. This is controllable by suppliers regardless of consumer opinion.
1.12.3.1. Pro: Morality is subjective and while vegan's believe suffering is wrong, others do not. This is an objective removal of pain and doesn't rely on morality.
1.12.3.1.1. Pro: Veganism is inconvenient and against the status quo. For this reason it requires personal effort, usually endured for the sake of morality.
1.12.3.2. Con: The rule is demand and supply. Actually consumers have the power to control the demand and it is up to suppliers to offer what is asked. If one takes a look at recent developments  they will realize that suppliers/businesses have to adopt or lose a lot of money.
1.12.3.2.1. Pro: McDonalds is already responding to the demand with[new vegan burgers](http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/19/news/mcdonalds-mcvegan-vegan-burger/index.html)\(McVegan\). This was tested in a small town in Finland and is now in almost every Finish and Swedish McDonalds
1.12.3.2.2. Pro: The dairy industry is already suffering a great loss because of the dairy free alternatives   [e.g. suicide prevention letters sent to farmers](http://www.thedailynewsonline.com/bdn01/daily-news-investigation-farmers-receiving-suicide-prevention-letters-with-milk-checks-20180303)
1.12.4. Con: There's a solvency issue with removing pain - it doesn't necessarily reduce the suffering of livestock animals, while more widespread adoption of vegan lifestyles would.
1.12.4.1. Con: While it could be argued that veganism is a best case scenario, this does not mean that it is any more likely to be widely adopted. Veganism is not a new approach, whereas this is.
1.12.4.1.1. Con: Veganism and vegetarianism are not new but both are becoming more common. There's no reason to think this trend will not continue as diet supplements and meat substitutes make a switch easier and campaigning convinces more people.
1.12.4.1.1.1. Pro: Six percent of Americans [identify as vegan](https://www.riseofthevegan.com/blog/veganism-has-increased-500-since-2014-in-the-us) today due to growing awareness of the impact of meat consumption on health and the environment. It was only one percent in 2014, showing a 500% increase in a short time.
1.12.4.1.1.2. Pro: Veganism has grown 350% among [millennials](https://munchies.vice.com/en_uk/article/9a8gve/this-is-why-millennials-are-all-turning-vegan) in the last 3 years. As younger generations often drive consumer markets, it is possible veganism will increase.
1.12.5. Pro: Consumption of meat and animal products plays a key role in the majority of cultures, which would take a long time to change.
1.13. Con: Modifying animals to be pain-free can put them at risk.
1.13.1. Con: In this case we have to look at whether an animal is a living being with certain rights, which are defined by applicable laws, or is simply the property of it's owner, which he may use and treat in the manner he or she wants to.
1.13.1.1. Con: Law is inconsequent in the matter of animal cruelty: it was made by humans for humans, our "ownership" of other living beings is only recognized by ourselves. We claim the lives of millions of cows, pigs, and chickens in order to feed ourselves every day, as if they were ours to take. But, when an animal kills a single human, they are sacrificed because "they are too dangerous".

Remember that slaves were once considered to be property on the basis of them being thought as inferior.
1.13.1.1.1. Con: The original claim was one of viability. Whether animals are inferior or not, and any cruelty to them other than that codified by law, is irrelevant to viability.
1.13.1.2. Con: -> See 1.12.1.1.
1.13.2. Pro: Animals experience pain for a reason, and therefore removing it would have negative consequences, leading to a worse outcome for the animals.
1.13.2.1. Con: The industry would not persist with pain-free animals if conditions were seen to be worse than previously.
1.13.2.1.1. Con: This would show that pain-free GMO animals are not a viable alternative.
1.13.2.2. Pro: Pain is necessary for animals to avoid danger, this would cause animals to accidentaly kill themselves by fighting, hiting hard or sharp surfaces trying to escape from humans, eating sharp stuff, accidentaly burn/electrocute/cut themselves to death; and shortening their lifes so much could be considered morally worse than inflicting them pain and would also reduce the amount of food they could provide to humans.
1.13.2.2.1. Pro: Animals that don't feel pain \(and, eventually, would not fear it\) can be dangerous, causing unexpected attacks to humans.
1.13.2.3. Pro: Creating an organism that cannot feel pain is cruel in itself. Pain is an evolutionary necessity to let organisms know when something is wrong with the body. Its a pointless effort since methods already exist to kill painlessly.
1.13.2.4. Pro: Pain can be a symptom of undetected bacterial or viral infections, disabling the pain response takes away from the early signals of disease and could potentially result in the inadvertant mass consumption of diseased meat products.
1.13.2.4.1. Con: We don't presently rely on pain as an indicator, instead we explicitly test for the presence of pathogens.
1.13.2.5. Pro: As pain is the compilation of sensory signals, ablating pain at a biological level leads to unawareness, major health and behavioral disorders and prematurated death.
1.13.3. Pro: Pain is necessary to avoid injury. There are people who do not feel pain and their main concern is blood loss and infection. We can treat these conditions with drugs however the cruelty in which animals under this regime would endure us abhorent.
1.13.4. Pro: It may make people more reckless with treatment of them and reduce respect given to these animals
1.13.4.1. Pro: Animals may be subjected to abuse since they are unable to feel pain.
1.13.4.1.1. Pro: Some people may justify behaving more inhumanely towards these animals because they do not feel pain.
1.13.4.1.1.1. Pro: These animals may be handled more roughly and packed more tightly into quarters that would cause a pain-feeling animal distress.
1.13.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Regulations \(i.e. minimum space for each specimen or handling manuals\) could be made in order to prevent the abuse.
1.13.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.
1.13.4.1.3. Pro: This could count as animal cruelty as they would not recognise the entirely natural stimulus of pain and as such may even damage their meat by damaging themselves without realising it.
1.13.4.1.4. Con: The experience of distress as a reaction to pain would actually be reduced in this scenario so a like-for-like classification of 'abuse' could not be made in pain-capable and pain-incapable animals. Abuse would need a different definition for each.
1.13.5. Con: The risks of being pain-free are 100% mitigated by being pain-free. If a chicken breaks it's leg because it doesn't feel pain, it continues not caring about it, because it doesn't feel pain. Indeed... even if it dies from such an injury, the experience is the same as falling asleep.
1.13.6. Pro: Pain serves a purpose for organisms in order to live. To walk you will need to feel. To feel is to be able to feel pain.
