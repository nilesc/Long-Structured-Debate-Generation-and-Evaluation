Discussion Title: Should Australia become a republic?

1. Australia should become a republic.
1.1. Pro: Catholic individuals are not allowed to become monarchs. This violates the freedom of religion in Australia.
1.1.1. Pro: [The Act of Settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_1701) decrees that no Roman Catholic can be heir to the throne.
1.1.2. Pro: The British monarch is also the [Supreme Governor of the Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Governor_of_the_Church_of_England), making it impossible for them to identify with any other religion.
1.1.3. Pro: [22.6% of Australians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Australia) identify as Catholic, making it the largest religion in the country. It is therefore ludicrous that the Head of State is forbidden from identifying with the Catholic religion.
1.2. Pro: The Head of State should be an Australian, not a foreigner or dual-citizen, to avoid political conflicts of interest.
1.2.1. Con: Theoretically an Australian could become monarch of England by marrying into the royal family.
1.2.2. Pro: If Australia and the UK became political or military opponents in the future, having the same head of state, who's primary responsibility is Britain, puts Australia at a severe disadvantage.
1.2.2.1. Con: The monarch holds [no legislative powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Australia) in Australia and as such would have no bearing on any political or military conflict.
1.2.3. Con: In practice, the Head of State is the [Governor-General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-General_of_Australia), who is and always has been an Australian citizen.
1.2.3.1. Con: The Governor-General is not our head of state only a representative of our head of state.
1.2.4. Con: Technically the monarch is Australian. While not a citizen of any nation, the Queen of England is equally the Queen of Australia, the Queen of Canada, etc. \(Note, this does not affect possible conflicts of interest\)
1.3. Con: Changing Australia's political system would be very expensive.
1.3.1. Con: No longer having to pay [expenses](https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/royals/charles-and-camillas-australia-visit-cost-taxpayers-1-million/news-story/9e537abe72068a7d3ca936f497aea78d) of royal visits would eventually pay off the cost of implementing a republic.
1.3.1.1. Con: Royal visits promote Australia as a tourist destination, making the expenditure a valid tourism investment.
1.3.1.2. Pro: [In Oct 2011, the cost of a 10-day royal visit was put at $5.85 million.](https://www.crikey.com.au/2014/03/06/royal-rates-what-youll-pay-for-will-and-kates-aussie-adventure/)
1.3.2. Pro: [Cost estimates](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-07-28/35542) range from $250 million to $2.5 billion.
1.4. Pro: Australia needs a unique national identity that is not defined by Britain.
1.4.1. Con: Australia already has a unique national identity that is not defined by any single agent such as Britain. Shared perception of history, e.g. former ties with Britain, is an important ingredient but it doesn't prevent from having a unique identity
1.4.2. Pro: Retaining the monarchy legitimises the British invasion of Australia and the genocide of Indigenous peoples that took place.
1.4.2.1. Pro: The British monarch's continued role in Australian politics is reminiscent of an imperial age of colonialism that should hold no place in the 21st century.
1.4.3. Pro: Australia is multicultural. Britain is only one of many nations from which immigration has occurred.
1.4.3.1. Con: There is no reason why monarchies cannot be multicultural; the two are not mutually exclusive.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Britain has an overwhelming claim on Australia that is not representative of the fact that Australians originate from many countries, not just Britain.
1.4.3.3. Con: But due to intensive immigration currently somewhere between 85% and 92% of all Australian population is of European decent. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians)
1.4.4. Pro: The Australian flag does not accurately represent Australian identity. The many thousands of years of Indigenous history should be far more prominent than a British invasion a few hundred years ago.
1.4.4.1. Con: Australian soldiers fought and died for that flag. Changing it would be disrespectful.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Australian soldiers fought and died for their country. For their families and friends. For duty and honour. For freedom. Not for a piece of fabric.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: Australia has already changed it. The blue ensign only became the Australian national flag in 1954. The ANZACS fought under the red ensign.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Having the British flag in the top left corner of Australia's flag symbolises that Australia is under British rule. If Australia is truly self-governing it should have a flag that symbolises that.
1.4.4.3. Con: The flag can be changed without becoming a republic
1.4.5. Con: Australian national identity has inevitably been defined by its historic relationship with Britain. To remove it would be to try to remove Australia's history.
1.5. Con: The [referendum in 1999](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_republic_referendum,_1999) showed that the Australian people like the Monarchy.
1.5.1. Con: The republic referendum was defeated due to division among republicans on the method proposed for selection of the president. The defeat does not indicate that the majority of Australians do not want ANY republic, just that they did not want the proposed republic.
1.6. Pro: Being a republic would award Australia with full political and legal freedom over its own country.
1.6.1. Pro: [The Australian constitution](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1943287) contains no power for the federal parliament to legislate with respect to the monarchy.
1.6.2. Con: There is no effective difference as the Queen is only a figurehead, with no real power.
1.6.2.1. Pro: The Queen's [only effective powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Australia) are the appointment of the Governor General, which is done on the advice of the Prime Minister.
1.6.2.2. Pro: The Australian Constitution limits the [royal prerogatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_prerogative#Australia) that the Monarch would typically hold, such as command of the armed forces, the appointment of ministers and the power to wage war. Instead, it is the Governor-General who retains these powers.
1.6.2.3. Con: There is a difference in how this figurehead, representative of the Australian nation, acquires their power. Rather than an undemocratic birth-right, it would be vested in someone chosen by the state.
1.7. Con: Designing a replacement political system is difficult / risky.
1.7.1. Con: Things worth doing are often difficult and risky - that is not justification enough not to do it.
1.7.2. Pro: The political system in the USA works poorly and should not be used as a model for Australia.
1.7.2.1. Pro: the state of US politics alone indicates the US system however well designed in theory, should not be copied into practice.
1.7.2.2. Con: There is no reason why the USA model is the only alternative available to Australia.
1.7.2.3. Pro: Australia and the USA are different countries culturally and the USA system would not work well and should not be copied in Australia.
1.7.3. Pro: The replacement political system could be designed by people who are either incompetent or self-interested, resulting in a negative outcome for the citizens.
1.7.3.1. Con: There is no reason why this would be the case today, any more than it was when the British imperialists devised the political system years ago.
1.7.3.2. Pro: The present political system, though devised by British imperialists, has been tested and is working well and the envy of many a country.  Making changes, designed by present day political power brokers, puts Australian citizens at risk of an untested political system which may not serve them as well.
1.7.4. Pro: Unelected official \(Governor-general\) with limited powers can be instrumental in resolving political crisis when elections produce inconclusive results and no government can be formed.
1.7.4.1. Con: There is no reason this role couldn't be retained in a republic, while eliminating the foreign Monarchy.
1.7.4.1.1. Pro: There are many parliamentary systems around the world that do not have a monarch, let alone a foreign monarch, and yet feature a Presidential figure who plays the same role as a constitutional monarch.
1.7.4.1.1.1. Pro: Italy, Ireland, Germany and India are all examples of [parliamentary republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_republic) that have a ceremonial presidents.
1.8. Con: Australia would no longer be able to compete in, or host, the Commonwealth Games.
1.8.1. Con: The majority of countries participating in the commonwealth games, including hosts, are republics. Australia would not be rejected based on its choice of political system.
1.8.2. Con: That is a small price to pay for all of the independence that becoming a republic would give to Australia.
