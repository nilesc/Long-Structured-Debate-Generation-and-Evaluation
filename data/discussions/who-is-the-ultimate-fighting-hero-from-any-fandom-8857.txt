Discussion Title: Who is the ultimate fighting hero from any fandom?

1. Which hero from any myth or fandom would win in a last entity standing free for all fight?
1.1. Superman is the most powerful fantasy hero and would win in a last entity standing style free for all.
1.1.1. Con: Weak to kryptonite.
1.1.2. Con: Superman is affected normally by [magical effects](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman/Shazam!:_The_Return_of_Black_Adam), rendering him entirely susceptible to a large portion of comic book heroes and villains outside his own storyline. In the ubiquitous DC v. Marvel Mashup, his invulnerability is greatly overestimated, given the presence of such formidable foes as Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, Loki, and over [100 canonical magic based Marvel characters.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Marvel_Comics_characters_who_use_magic)
1.1.3. Con: Plastic Man has been known to make Superman cautious with fearful respect.
1.1.4. Pro: Superman is indistructable to most normal means of attack, can fly, has x- ray vision, super speed, freeze breath, is healed by our sun and can manipulate time on a global scale.
1.2. Goku is the most powerful fantasy hero and would win in a last entity  standing style free for all.
1.2.1. Con: Canonically, Goku has died three times, and never won the World Martial Arts Tournament, thus proving that even within his own pond he is neither strongest nor undefeatable.
1.2.1.1. Con: Everytime Goku has died he has returned to the mortal realm stronger and more powerful then before. Thus far it is safe to assume that inorder to effectively kill Goku one must first negate any means he has to return from the dead such as the dragonballs and his many allies.
1.2.1.2. Con: Goku won the 23rd world martial arts tournament when he defeated Piccolo Jr.
1.2.1.3. Con: Goku is not the strongest hero in any fandom, he could easiy be defeated by Ichigo, Sauske, Madara, Thanos.
1.3. Given enough preptime, it is an observable fact that Batman can overcome any obstacle. With a limitless and arbitrarilally relevant arsenal, he always has the specific tool needed to ensure victory.
1.3.1. Con: Given that other entities may be ageless or immortal, one would have to assume Batman would be willing to attain that status to have the needed amount of prep time to eventually succeed. There are many plot lines where he has chosen to retire.
1.3.2. Pro: Batman posesses a vast business empire involved in r&d and production of various technologies.
1.4. Chuck Norris
1.4.1. Pro: Chuck Norris doesn't cheat Death, he wins fair and square.
1.5. Saitama is the most powerful fantasy hero and would win in last entity standing style free for all.
1.5.1. Pro: He is by definition the One Punch Man. The point of the character is that he can beat ANY opponent in one punch \(if he gets serious enough\).
1.5.2. Con: One punch is true enough, but he has to land the punch first. An opponent with enough speed could evade that.
1.5.2.1. Con: Saitama has shown that he can effortlessly keep up with Speed-o'-Sound Sonic, who moves faster than the speed of sound.
1.5.3. Pro: There is a theory which states that if a villain from one Universe ends up in another, and the heroes of that world fight it, they cannot defeat it unless they use what the villain is weak against. Saitama, has no weakness because he has already broken his limit.
1.5.3.1. Con: Saitama is not a villain.
1.5.4. Con: A non-corporeal hero who is not affected by punches \(like the [Phoenix Force](https://marvel.com/universe/Phoenix_Force), which survives even the re-collapse of the universe\) would not be affected by his only power.
1.6. The Hulk is the most powerful fantasy hero and would win in a last entity standing style free for all.
1.6.1. Pro: You wouldn’t like him when he gets angry. The Hulk's power source is rage and anything you can do that hurts him without annihilation will make him stronger.
1.6.2. Con: The Flash can easily defeat him due to his ability to manipulate physics which allows him to reach incredible speeds allowing him to do a many number of things to defeat Hulk.
1.7. The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl. It's right there in the name.
1.7.1. Pro: On Marvel's official power rating site [Squirrel Girl](https://marvel.com/universe/Squirrel_Girl) is the only hero with every possible trait maxed to the limit. This is greater than [Thanos](https://marvel.com/universe/Thanos), whom she defeated. Only [Galactus](https://marvel.com/universe/Galactus) and the [Phoenix Force](https://marvel.com/universe/Phoenix_Force) are her match.
1.8. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.
1.9. Wonder Woman
1.10. Thor is the most powerful fantasy hero and would win in a last entity standing style free for all.
1.10.1. Con: Hulk beats Thor. It is shown in Thor; Ragnarok and is therefore cannon meaning that Thor is not the most powerful and there are many others in both comics, film and faith that could defeat him.
1.11. I am Groot!
1.11.1. Pro: I am Groot!
1.12. The [Phoenix Force](https://marvel.com/universe/Phoenix_Force) is an immortal, indestructible, and mutable manifestation of the prime universal force of life, derived from the psyches of all living beings. It survives even the recollapse of the universe and even created Galactus from the last man remaining from the previous universe. There is no destroying the Phoenix Force.
1.13. Rogue is the most powerful fantasy hero and would win in a last entity standing style free for all.
1.13.1. Pro: Absorbs powers of mutants everyone is a mutant in one way or other.
1.13.1.1. Con: D.C. has prominently featured the villain [A.M.A.Z.O.](http://dcau.wikia.com/wiki/A.M.A.Z.O.), who's ability to steal powers has rendered him a formidable opponent against powered superheroes, but ineffective against unpowered superheroes, like Batman.
1.14. Deadpool is the ultimate winner of any fight.
1.14.1. Pro: Deadpool's [healing ability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool#Powers_and_abilities) makes him almost immortal.
1.14.2. Con: If he's still technically alive due to his power, but not intact enough to stand up, someone else can qualify as "last entity standing" first.
1.15. Mr Rogers \([in a blood-stained sweater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WgT9gy4zQA)\)
1.16. Jesus is the ultimate fantasy hero and would win in a last entity standing free for all.
1.16.1. Pro: Jesus is a great negotiator.

1.16.1.2. Pro: turns water to wine.
1.16.1.3. Pro: Strong father figure. Part of the holy trinity.
1.16.1.4. Pro: Able to resurect after death at least once.
1.16.1.5. Con: Prone to losing temper when gambling at temples is involved.
1.16.2. Con: Pacifist.
1.16.3. Con: Historically, Jesus is known for sacrificing himself to save others. Though He would only be dead for three days, this would likely disqualify Him from taking first place in a free-for-all tournament.
1.16.3.1. Con: One occurrence doesn’t make a trend.
1.16.4. Pro: The Jesus Fandom is huge \(although they don't like to be called that\), giving him popularity power.
1.17. Dr. Who is the ultimate fantasy hero and would win in a last entity standing free for all.
1.17.1. Pro: The Dr owns and operates a Tardis. This vehicle allows him to travel through time and space and sometimes travel through other dimensions.
1.17.1.1. Pro: The Dr often posses a Sonic Screwdriver a sufficently advance technological multitool which allows him to do virtually anything that such a plot device allows.
1.17.1.2. Pro: Upon dying The Dr is capabable of regenerating multiple times.
1.17.1.2.1. Con: The Doctor has to regenerate before death, but is able to do this every time death is near.
1.17.1.3. Pro: The Dr is known to choose Companions who accompany him in his travels often aiding in his adventures, but also they mostly keep him sane.
1.17.2. Con: The Doctor has a weakness for protecting a certain alien race, namely humans.
1.17.3. Con: There are many things the Doctor is susceptible to: he can be killed, as hard as it is. Although I'm sure he likes to believe it he is not God.
1.17.4. Pro: His vast knowledge and experience help him to solve most problems and defeat his enemies.
1.17.5. Con: The Doctor is a pacifist, which makes them a bad fighter.
