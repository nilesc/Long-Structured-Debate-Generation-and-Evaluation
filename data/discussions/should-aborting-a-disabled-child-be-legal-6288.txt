Discussion Title: Should Aborting a Disabled Child Be Legal?

1. Aborting a disabled child should be legal.
1.1. Pro: One or both parents may not be emotionally or psychologically stable enough to handle the personal costs of caring for a disabled child.
1.1.1. Pro: A woman with an increased risk of [postpartum depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/postpartum-depression/tc/postpartum-depression-what-increases-your-risk) may not be able to handle the stress and extra responsibility of taking care of a disabled child. It is in her best interest to abort.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Women [suffering](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/postpartum-depression#1) from postpartum depression can be a danger to their newborn.
1.1.2. Pro: The child can often destroy a healthy marriage with the increased demands, and thus not only indirectly but directly affect the healthy upbringing of siblings.
1.1.3. Con: A great deal of support for parents of disabled children is available through charity.
1.1.4. Pro: Disabled or not, if the parents cannot provide a healthy and progressive environment for a child, it should be their decision if they go through with it or not.
1.1.5. Con: Disabled children are not the only children who are difficult, and it isn't only the parents of disabled children who find themselves unprepared. This logic would excuse the abortion of anybody whose parents were not entirely emotionally prepared for parenthood.
1.1.5.1. Con: It is irresponsible to force unwilling or unprepared would-be parents to complete their pregnancy when the world is severely overpopulated already.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: Contraception must be promoted instead of abortion. It is more humane,  cheaper and less painful.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Contraception is readily available, but often unused or misused. Accidents happen, and unfortunately there needs to be a back up option.
1.1.5.1.3. Pro: Contraception is before embryo has been conceived. However, abortion should be a choice available if that embryo has flagged up genetic condition even if the pregnancy was wanted. People want a child, not a burden. Forcing them to continue to birth is against their rights.
1.1.5.2. Con: Abortion is unpleasant, but child abuse and neglect are far worse.
1.1.6. Con: They can give the child up for adoption, thus giving him/her a chance at life with a stable set of parents. This is a better option than aborting.
1.1.6.1. Con: Most care homes struggle as it is, as do most children struggle to be rehomed. It should be seen as a safety net for unavoidable problems, not an equal alternative to parenting your offspring yourself.
1.1.6.2. Con: Caring for a disabled child may require large investments to improve the child's quality of life. Only someone loving the child would be willing to sacrifice a large sum of one's own money.
1.1.6.3. Con: Many foster homes are not a good environment for a child.
1.2. Con: It should not be left to lawmakers to decide which disabilities classify as legal or illegal to abort.
1.2.1. Pro: Thin end of the wedge. Once aborting disabled children becomes the 'norm', there is no telling what other legalised abortions it could lead to.
1.2.2. Con: If so, then all abortions of disabilities should be legal regardless of reason.
1.2.3. Pro: If lawmakers are given this right, it can evolve into legal targeted genocide.
1.2.4. Con: Lawmakers are not the only ones who get to decide. There first has to be public interest or concern for it to be brought to lawmakers.
1.3. Con: Abortion must be illegal, regardless of its reasons, as long as it is not necessary for the mother's health.
1.3.1. Con: A person deserves the right to accept and forget traumatic events, such as rape.  Being forced to have a child after such an event, is forcing that person to love something that started with a traumatic event.
1.3.1.1. Con: Delivering a baby doesn’t force loving it. If she finds herself unable to love it, it can be given for adoption.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Millions of children around the world are already growing up in orphanages, [suffering from a large spectre of disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care#Medical_and_psychiatric_disorders) and generally ending up worse off than children growing up in families. Giving birth to a child with a high likelihood to do worse in life than his peers growing up in families seems unnecessary cruel.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Everyone does worse than someone. Who decides at which level „a life worth living“ begins?
1.3.1.1.2. Con: There are far too many children than there are good foster homes. We must increase a large number of new foster homes to care for the many children we already have on waiting lists, before we create a large new influx of babies if abortion is made illegal.
1.3.1.2. Con: Killing an unborn baby does not fix or better the rape that has already occurred.
1.3.1.3. Con: While it could be harm to mother to give birth to such child, it is also possible that she would love such child, which would make her suffering smaller.
1.3.1.4. Con: Abortion could even make problems worse because of psychical and ethical impact of such decision.
1.3.2. Con: Abortion must be a choice. The choice therein encompasses the responsibility of being fully informed of her own reasons for following through with the procedure, no matter her decision. Lest she be viewed as unable to arbitrate in the eyes of the government and legal system, even in her full capacities. The illegality of abortion strips the woman of the humanity of decision making. The decision to abort is never, ever a simple one.
1.3.2.1. Con: If we consider life of a Homo Sapiens as valuable there such be at least some restrictions on abortion.
1.3.3. Pro: The child in question seems to always be ignored.  Even for rape cases, a child's life outweighs almost everything.
1.3.4. Con: If the mother is in a financial crisis, this could risk the mother's, father's and child's future.
1.3.4.1. Con: This is true of any child and also justifies killing one among any pair of twins.
1.4. Con: Terminating pregnancy based on a child's disabilities would send a message that disabled people are unwanted by the society.
1.4.1. Pro: The decision to end another persons life should not be based upon an assumption , another persons personal opinion that the disability will cause that person to be unhappy in life or that it might inconvenience them or others in some way.
1.4.1.1. Con: The decision to end a ball of cells existence \(note: not "a life"\) can be rationally made based on whether that ball of cells' development is going well or not.[Human Embryogenesis](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/HumanEmbryogenesis.svg/550px-HumanEmbryogenesis.svg.png)
1.4.2. Con: The broadcast of the termination is not necessary.
1.4.3. Con: Disabled people are infact unwanted by society. They are accommodated, as well as possible, and rightly so. However they are not a desired result of procreation, clearly.
1.4.3.1. Con: A person that bears one undesirable characteristic can not immediately be deemed undesirable. For example, Stephen Hawking could have passed extremely desirable genes when already aware of his disability.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: He was 21 before showing any symptoms. Few cases of his condition are genetic \(10%\), but genetic screening of the embryo to lower risk further would have been an advantage. He may be smart, which is heritable, but we are discussing aborting embryos that show up as carrying the condition. [news.bbc.co.uk](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8009804.stm)
1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: Screening might have allowed earlier treatment, but here we discuss abortion, which would have bereft us of a great scientist and teacher.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: On a professional level the referenced person was successful, however the condition prevented a happy home life for those around him. Life is difficult enough; reducing the medical burden on society also removes it on a micro level.[google.de](https://www.google.de/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/16/jane-hawking-there-were-four-of-us-in-marriage-stephen-hawking-theory-of-everything)
1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: Unhappy thinkers and creators, such as Kekule or Kafka are by no means, no desired result of procreation“. Please mind the parent claim.
1.4.3.1.2.2. Pro: Partners often feel trapped as carers when conditions progress. Most genetic conditions become medically important later in life \(due to evolutionary forces\), so those in good health when young become less able with time.
1.4.3.2. Con: This assumes that the disability is the sum of all of the person's worth.  There are many aspects to a person, and while he may have certain disabilities, he has inherent worth as a human.  There are many ways people contribute to society, not all of them economic.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Holding all else equal, one would not deliberately choose for their child to be born with birth defects. Therefore, it is an unwanted outcome.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: There are few who would make such a choice to show the  world that it is not so bad, that disabled people are also human worth living.
1.4.3.4. Con: Even if disabled are really unwanted it is not good to manifest this concept in such brutal way, because it will make their life even harder.
1.4.4. Pro: Medical model of disability can overestimate medical burden.[books.google.de](https://books.google.de/books?id=RnDA0EKcMaEC&pg=PA149&lpg=PA149&dq=medical+burden+of+disabled+citizens&source=bl&ots=Y6urmTnKqA&sig=bKnjR6BfyhT7baNfGhEcYa3CW-c&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjq8-ydx7bZAhVMthQKHVa8D4YQ6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=medical%20burden%20of%20disabled%20citizens&f=false)
1.4.5. Con: If we knew the child would suffer \(more than life already bestows\), it is a kindness to prevent that suffering.
1.4.6. Pro: Children with disabilities contribute to society in ways that are overlooked because their condition is often seen as a burden to their families and society.
1.4.6.1. Pro: In what world can people decide who gets to live and who gets to die? Even though the child might have a mental disability that doesn't mean that we should kill the child. Take Hellen Keller for example, she was thought of as "useless" in the world but look at all the things that she accomplished.
1.4.6.2. Pro: We as humans have a lot to learn from disabled people. Preventing their being would devalue society.
1.4.6.2.1. Pro: Disabled children grow into disabled adults who can add significant value to society in all areas
1.4.7. Pro: It would further send the message that disabled people do not have lives that are in themselves valuable. All life is good and valuable.
1.4.7.1. Con: Not everyone sees every form of life as inherently good or valuable.
1.5. Con: No one has a right to determine whether or not another person will die because of a disability.
1.5.1. Pro: By giving this right to another, the disabled is at the mercy of someone who may not know what is best.
1.5.2. Con: Someone has to decide if a given fetus comes to term or not. Any 'right' to determine if an entire category of people is not allowed to die implies the right to decide that each individual one of them will not die.
1.5.2.1. Con: Not everything is rightfully decided by outsiders. For instance, people don’t want to cede the right to choose their partner in marriage.
1.5.3. Con: Each individual has the right to live the life they want. If the parents don't wish to have a disabled child, they have to right to abort it. Nobody should be forced to have one.
1.5.3.1. Con: The premise, applied to the baby, precludes abortion.
1.5.4. Con: A fetus is strictly [not a person](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fetal+Rights) so while that argument is true it does not pertain to the thesis at hand.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Something that lacks a functioning nervous system cannot be said to have a subjective experience, so it cannot be a person.
1.5.4.2. Con: A homo sapien fetus is human, therefore a fetus has human rights at least.  Among the inalienable human rights is the right to life.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: In view of the law human is a person, and even if we talk about fetus which belong to the Homo Sapiens species, it is not human in view of current law.
1.5.4.2.2. Con: [A fetus is no more human](http://www.uhs.nhs.uk/Media/Controlleddocuments/Patientinformation/Pregnancyandbirth/Havinganextremelyprematurebaby-patientinformation.pdf) than a sperm or an egg.
1.5.4.3. Con: Even as law states that fetus is not a person, it is not obvious whether decision of abortion is ethicaly proper.
1.5.5. Con: Medical triage is an accepted practice where doctors determine whether or not someone receives treatment potentially deciding between life and death. If there are multiple fetuses in a pregnancy and one of them is severely disabled such as to endanger the others, doctors may be justified in aborting the disabled fetus to save the healthy fetuses.
1.5.5.1. Con: Additional issues such as the fetus endangering the life of other fetuses, or endangering the life of the mother, are more extreme cases than just a fetus with a disability. Endangering the other life, not the disability, would justify an abortion.
1.5.5.2. Con: Prioritization of patients to receive treatment is not the same as actively euthanizing patients deemed low-priority.  Performing an abortion is an active step, not a passive withholding of treatment.
1.5.6. Pro: If humans were allowed to systematically interfere with how and which babies are born, we would have too much power on our hands. This may lead to selective breeding among humans-- looking for certain characteristics and abandoning others. It is not proven that human knowledge on this matter exceeds the natural order.
1.5.6.1. Con: Humans already practice selective breeding. It's done with every date you go on, or in whom you even find attractive \(physically and mentally\).
1.6. Pro: Under current law the answer is trivially "yes," because aborting any fetus is legal.
1.6.1. Pro: A fetus up to a certain point is in many places including the U.S. [not recognized legally as a person](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fetal+Rights), and as such the human rights of the mother supersede it.
1.6.1.1. Con: Many of the laws are based on our ability to keep a premature baby alive. As we get better at this \([able to keep them alive at earlier stages](https://www.wnyc.org/radio/#/ondemand/586996)\) we should review and update the laws.
1.6.1.2. Con: The existence or non-existence of legislation has no bearing on the morality of something. Slavery was legal, but it was not right. The fact that some legislatures do not recognize a fetus as having life does not mean they are correct, or morally right for that matter.
1.6.1.3. Con: Fetus means child in [Latin](http://www.latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/fetus).
1.6.1.3.1. Con: The legal or scientific recognition of a word is not decided by its Latin origins.
1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.2.
1.6.3. Con: What is legal doesn't determine what should be. People make mistakes and are quite rarely deciding because of ethical value, especially when financial value comes in play.
1.6.3.1. Con: A law is an attempt to determine what is right or wrong, or what should be considered such.
1.6.4. Con: There are places in the US where it is illegal to abort on the basis of sex, race and genetic abnormalities. [theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/sex-disability-race-selective-abortion-indiana/482856/)
1.7. Pro: Abortion can be used as a [preventative measure](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/11/29/u-n-human-rights-commissioner-urges-abortion-down-syndrome-babies/) to prevent a child from a life of suffering.
1.7.1. Con: An outside agent cannot clearly determine the weight of suffering against the value of their own life, and thus ought not act due to their limited understanding.
1.7.1.1. Con: Inaction is impossible in the case of pregnancy; carrying the fetus to term IS action.
1.7.2. Pro: It's best to prevent a disable child from being born, giving a chance at life to one that will be able to experience life fully.
1.7.2.1. Con: Disabled people are generally as equally satisfied with life as healthy people, as long as they have support and are not isolated. Parents should be made aware of all the support available not advised to abort.
1.7.2.2. Con: There are many people with disabilities that live a fuller life than those without them.
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: Plenty of disabled people live very very happy lives. 99% of Down syndromes say they are happy with their lives. 97% say they are happy with who they are. Killing such people is a purely selfish act. These are some of the happiest people on the planet.   [www.lifesitenews.com](https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/99-of-people-with-down-syndrome-say-they-are-happy-so-why-are-most-downs-ba)
1.7.2.3. Con: This is a false dichotomy. Taking away life from a disabled person does not automatically give a life to a non-disabled person. Likewise, giving life to a disabled person does not prevent said able bodied person from existing.
1.7.2.4. Con: It is not legislator's prerogative to decide how "full" somebody's life is or would be.
1.7.3. Con: Disabilities that are a heavy burden now may well be treatable in the near future. And the opportunities for disabled people to participate in all venues of life have improved dramatically.
1.7.4. Con: Once probable suffering is accepted as a legal reason to terminate life, the right to evaluate its likelihood may shift from the mother to the state on the grounds of objectivity. Poor mothers may then be forced to abort against their will. That is clearly to be not in the interest of mothers.
1.7.4.1. Con: The state should not be involved, but the state likely will not become involved simply due to the controversy generated from such involvement.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: Forcing can easily take forms that appear to be the mother‘s choice. Such as extreme financial motivations.
1.7.5. Con: This also implies that in countries, where females are heavily disadvantaged, aborting females solely for their sex should be legal.
1.7.6. Con: “Suffering” is a relative term based on circumstance, environment, geographical location, and current technology available. A child born in the rural South or rural Midwest of the United States is arguably at a disadvantage in comparison to the same child born in a more well developed metropolitan area on the East or West Coast when it comes to access to medical care.
1.7.7. Con: It is hard to say whether child with disability would live life of suffering. For some it might be true, for some not.
1.7.8. Con: Many disabled people are happy and glad to be alive. One would be hard pressed to find a disabled individual who would rather have been aborted.
1.7.9. Con: The child should have a right to decide for himself if his life is worth living.
1.7.9.1. Con: This argument is invalid in cases where the person would not be able to consent.
1.7.9.1.1. Pro: Some disabled individuals may still not be able to consent verbally or otherwise due to their condition.
1.8. Con: Once the baby‘s right to life is made conditional, the legal basis for more exceptions is created. Children from an area with high criminality, born and unborn, may come next.
1.8.1. Con: Many disabilities can be genetically tested for and diagnosed in the womb. They are a physical trait in their DNA. Criminality is a psychological and sociological issue with no way to test for therefore this connection is invalid.
1.9. Con: All life is precious.
1.10. Con: Disabled children and their families contribute to our culture through their accomplishments and perseverance.
1.11. Con: Prenatal screenings cannot grant with 100% security that its results are true. This would mean the abortion of healthy children in some of the cases.
1.11.1. Pro: In one case, an expectant mother was hours away from a recommended and scheduled abortion when she was informed that her baby was [misdiagnosed](https://www.liveaction.org/news/caution-genetic-testing-not-100-accurate/) via  a pre-screening.
1.11.2. Con: Women with initial abnormal results can do more tests to gain certainty, such as [amniocentesis tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniocentesis).
1.11.2.1. Con: Even the amniocentesis test is not 100% accurate \(at best it is given a 99.4% accuracy rate [webmd.com](https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-amniocentesis#2-5) although most estimates claim that it is only 98%-99% accurate [americanpregnancy.org](http://americanpregnancy.org/prenatal-testing/amniocentesis/) \). Yes the test is for the most part a reliable ,although not absolute, indicator of disability - however there still remains the possibility of human error with any diagnostic test that can occur in the lab or as a result other negligent human mistakes that can lead to inaccurate test results .
1.11.2.2. Con: No pre-natal screen is 100% accurate.
1.12. Pro: Abortion allows for selective human evolution for non-disabled genes, which leads to a stronger species.
1.12.1. Pro: Reducing the prevalence of recessive gene conditions from the population is good for overall society; more attention/facilities/staff will be available to deal with other patients \(afflicted other, non-heritable, conditions\).[A brief discussion on genetic conditions.](http://science.jrank.org/pages/2975/Genetic-Disorders-Recessive-genetic-disorders.html)
1.12.2. Con: A person’s gene pool does not consist of one characteristic \(disabled/non disabled\). The species would not be stronger for aborting Stephen Hawking on the grounds of disability, for example.
1.12.3. Pro: Modern society has halted natural selection. Scientific advances can keep most people alive and well long enough to breed, whatever their condition. It is now our responsibility to try to improve the future outcome of human evolution. [David Attenborough- Humans stopped natural selection.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/evolution/10297124/Sir-David-Attenborough-Humans-have-stopped-evolving.html)
1.12.3.1. Con: Selection still occurs, especially sexually. As our society changed, disabled people have more and more potential to contribute to society. We can’t propose selections based on the priorities of prehistoric society.
1.12.4. Con: This suggests eugenics, which may not be considered moral.
1.12.4.1. Pro: The legalization must be complete. If it applies only for some cases, then it isn't any different from other eugenic policies that selectively chooses the most desired gene expressions.
1.12.4.1.1. Con: There are countless laws that only apply in certain circumstances.
1.12.4.2. Pro: In fact this is called eugenics. The Germans used this method during Hitler's time, killing weaker children right after they were born.
1.12.4.3. Con: Idealogical eugenics \(whitest, smartest, prettiest\) is unwanted. However, due to medical advances and modern society, evolution is no longer able to improve the human population \(genetic conditions\) with natural selection. It is our responsibility to remove poor genes where possible.
1.12.4.3.1. Con: It has been shown that [many human traits are subject to natural selection](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/evolutionary-adaptation-in-the-human-lineage-12397)
1.12.4.4. Con: Eugenics is not universally considered immoral.
1.12.5. Con: Having the right to abort children based on preference is immoral. A disabled person's right to live is the same as a normal person's.
1.12.5.1. Con: The right to live is equal. The right to be born is under discussion.
1.13. Pro: The right of abortion must always be given, as long as it does not threaten the mother's health, regardless of the person's reasons.
1.13.1. Con: "The right to swing my fist ends where the other man's nose begins." -[Oliver Wendell Holmes](http://"The right to swing my fist ends where the other man's nose begins" -Oliver Wendell Holmes)  The entire purpose of law is to ensure that an individual's right to live their life as they choose does not impact anyone else's freedom and right to live their lives as they choose . Abortion takes away someone else's right to live and to make choices when they are capable of doing that in the future .
1.13.1.1. Con: The [violin player thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Defense_of_Abortion) argues that the right to life does not include the right to use another person's body. Abortion does not violate the fetus's right to life but merely deprives it of use of the mother's body to which it has no right.
1.13.2. Con: That legalises abortion of females based on sex, which is guaranteed to happen in societies keen to preserve the paternal line.
1.13.3. Pro: The [right of abortion](https://www.kialo.com/should-women-have-the-right-to-choose-abortion-5637/5637.0=5637.1/=5637.1) is a right over one's body, which is a universal human right.
1.13.3.1. Con: The body of their child is not their own body, its someone else's body.
1.13.3.1.1. Con: A woman has the right to decide whether her body is used to sustain someone else's life.
1.13.3.1.1.1. Con: She does so before getting pregnant.
1.13.3.2. Con: Humans do not universally have rights over their own bodies. There are many things that we are not allowed to do with our bodies.
1.13.3.3. Con: The [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) does not include the right over one's body.
1.13.3.3.1. Con: The "security of person" , as outlined in [Article 3](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), gives one the right over their own body, specifically to prevent their body from being the domain of someone else.
1.13.4. Pro: It is not the place of the government to decide the validity of someone's reasons for having an abortion.
1.13.4.1. Pro: Many people believe that aborting a disabled child is ethical. The ethics of a government should reflect the ethics of it's citizens. [Australian Parents Choose to Abort 93% of Down Syndrome Fetuses](https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2017/08/17/down-syndrome-birth-terminations/)
1.13.5. Con: No one has the right to kill another human without that person's consent. A mother's rights to bodily autonomy are waived where they conflict with the baby's right to life.
1.13.5.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.
1.13.6. Pro: We do not have a right to force somebody to make a decision that's not right for them especially if the consequence might hurt a dependent \(ie bad moms who did't want the responsibility in the first place\)
1.14. Pro: Abortion in cases of disabled children would save families the higher financial burden of supporting such offspring.
1.14.1. Pro: Taking care of a disabled child can cost [4 times](https://blog.mint.com/planning/the-cost-of-raising-a-special-needs-child-0713/) as much as a child without disabilities.
1.14.1.1. Con: Money is not as important as the child. There are many people and programs to help.
1.14.1.1.1. Con: If the family cannot support the child they will end up dead through lack of needs being met or taken by social services.
It's more ethical to stop the child existing before it has any ability to suffer than to bring it into a world where it will only suffer.
1.14.2. Pro: Families with a disabled child, or children are more likely to be [single-income homes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1802121/), as one parent takes the caregiver role. This puts substantial financial strain on the family.
1.14.3. Con: Not having any children in the first place is a better option if your only concern in life is money.
1.14.3.1. Con: The decision to abort due to finances does not mean one's only concern is money, but simply at this moment in their life they are not capable of taken on the extra financial needs of having a disabled child.
1.14.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.
1.14.3.2. Con: Considering the financial challenges of having a disable child shows responsibility and also consideration for the hardships the child may have to endure due to lack of proper funds.
1.14.3.2.1. Con: Enduring hardship is often better than not having a life.
1.14.3.2.2. Con: There is a lot of help available for people with disabilities. Government programs, charities, and kind people. Shriners Hospitals For Children, for example, does great things for children with disabilities regardless of their ability to pay.
1.14.4. Con: If killing a child at the age of 5, 10, 18, or 21 years because they are a financial burden is not acceptable, so it should not be acceptable in the womb.
1.14.4.1. Con: As soon as a child enters the world, s/he becomes an individual human being with rights, and it is not acceptable to kill an individual. A fetus in the womb is not an individual. The carrier of the fetus should have full rights to her own body, including anything that is feeding off her body. It can be argued, if a fetus is developed enough to live outside of the womb \(prematurely at 22+ months\), then an abortion should not be allowed after that. [www.newsweek.com](https://www.newsweek.com/babies-born-22-weeks-can-survive-medical-care-new-study-finds-329518)
1.14.4.2. Con: -> See 1.6.1.
1.15. Pro: If a family does not wish to have a disabled child, it would be better for the child not to be born than to live feeling unwanted by his/her family.
1.15.1. Pro: Approximately [30 percent](https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/09/15/abandoned-state/violence-neglect-and-isolation-children-disabilities-russian) of children in Russia with disabilities end up living in closed institutions away from their families.
1.15.1.1. Con: Having a life in an institution is better than not being born at all.
1.15.1.2. Con: That only means we have to improve the status of disabled people in Russia, as we already did elsewhere.
1.15.2. Con: There are several accounts of children with disabilities being loved, respected, an inspiration, and enhancing the lives of  adoptive parents and other family members.
1.15.3. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.15.4. Pro: Abortion should not have restrictions at all. If a woman or couple want to give birth to a child and to raise him, they obviously want a healthy child. The idea of most parents is to raise a "normal" person and not a disabled one. They would save the disabled child all the suffering the child would live if it was born.
1.15.4.1. Con: The fallacy consists in regarding the child as defined solely by its disability, when in fact it possesses many desirable and undesirable qualities, which may render it more welcome than certain healthy children.
1.15.4.2. Con: Everyone suffers not only the disabled.
1.15.4.3. Con: This state that life of a of Homo Sapiens \(as not everybody agree unborn child is human\) is worth less than another Homo Sapiens comfort / wish and any other value of low importancy.
1.15.5. Con: A family's feelings can change upon the delivery of a baby. This is often the case when [a mother holds her infant](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/forming-a-bond-with-your-baby-why-it-isnt-always-immediate#1) for the first time.
1.15.6. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.15.7. Pro: There are several accounts of children with disabilities being abandoned or abused by their families. Abortion can save them from experiencing this.
1.15.7.1. Con: If the parent is immoral, he will abuse healthy children too.  He is not likely to choose abortion out of concern for the child either. The solutions are adoption and prosecution. Not abortion.
