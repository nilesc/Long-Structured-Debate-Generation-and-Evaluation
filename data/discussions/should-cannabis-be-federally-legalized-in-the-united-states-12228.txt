Discussion Title: Should Cannabis Be Federally Legalized In The United States?

1. Cannabis should be federally legalized in the United States
1.1. Pro: Restricting use of marijuana violates [bodily integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodily_integrity), which is considered a human right.
1.1.1. Pro: For people suffering from certain illnesses for which marijuana can help, not allowing it to be legal violates the right to a healthier body.
1.1.1.1. Pro: One terminally ill woman was [denied medical marijuana](https://cei.org/blog/dying-woman-denied-right-take-medical-marijuana), even though it was recommended by a physician to save her life when other drugs failed.
1.2. Con: Cannabis can negatively impact health.
1.2.1. Con: Any minor negative health impacts are not enough justification to forcibly imprison hundreds of thousands of peaceful citizens, depriving them of their ability to support themselves and their families. This should be reserved for actual criminals who violently harm others.
1.2.2. Pro: There are negative health claims that marijuana is bad for the heart.
1.2.2.1. Con: So are cigarettes and alcohol but we aren’t making those illegal. Cigarettes have tons of carcinogens in them when the marijuana that is most often smoked has barely any.
1.2.2.2. Con: There are negative health claims that [Tylenol can cause liver damage](https://www.medicinenet.com/tylenol_liver_damage/article.htm#is_it_safe_for_me_to_take_tylenol) too. Clearly that is not justification for imprisoning people who use it for a headache.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Scientists discovered that people with established heart disease who are experiencing stress [develop chest pains quicker](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/marijuana-and-heart-health-what-you-need-to-know) if they were smoking marijuana than they would have otherwise.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: They found that cannabinoids, the active compound in marijuana has a complex effect on the cardiovascular system, such as raising resting heart rate, dilating blood vessels, and making the heart pump harder.
1.2.2.3.2. Con: The negative impact on specific groups should not mean that marijuana should remain illegal at the federal level. It only means that those specific groups shouldn't use marijuana.
1.2.3. Con: Individual health choices should not be a major concern of the government, therefore we can't not keep something illegal based on individual effects on health alone.
1.2.4. Con: While cannabis can negatively impact a person's health, it can be a better alternative than more harmful substances like opiates which are commonly prescribed to manage pain.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Recreational cannabis is an alternative to tobacco and alcohol.
1.2.5. Con: Legalisation would facilitate medical research into the health benefits and detriments of cannabis.
1.2.6. Con: Cannabis is safer than other recreational drugs with no independently associated mortality. CDC statistics show cannabis does not significantly statistically increase mortality when combined with alcohol & driving \[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5816577/\])
1.2.7. Con: Having a negative impact on health has not resulted in the banning of other substances, and therefore should not influence the legality of cannabis.
1.2.7.1. Pro: Alcohol can negatively impact not only health, but also social behavior and quite severely so. Still nobody would suggest to resurrect the prohibition.
1.2.8. Pro: Marijuana smoke is an [irritant](https://www.thoracic.org/patients/patient-resources/resources/marijuana.pdf) to the throat and lungs, which can lead to inflammation and increased risk of respiratory issues, like pneumonia.
1.2.8.1. Con: You don't need to smoke it. You don't need to use it all, consumer should be free to choose.
1.2.9. Con: Throwing otherwise peaceful people in prison has a [much greater negative impact](https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/psychological-impact-incarceration-implications-post-prison-adjustment) on their physical, emotional and economic health than cannabis use.
1.2.10. Con: A sedentary lifestyle can have negative health impact too, but no one suggests prison time for people who sit for more than an hour a day.
1.3. Pro: Legalization gets rid of the black market involvement.
1.3.1. Con: [Black market](https://priceonomics.com/the-most-expensive-and-cheapest-cities-to-buy/) is often cheaper than legal cannabis, thus there will always be a demographic to sell to.
1.3.2. Con: Many drugs are legal, yet available via black market, such as [opioids](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=213020).
1.3.3. Con: Reduces the black market \(does not eliminate, at least not in any historical instance to date\).
1.4. Pro: Legalizing marijuana will free up space in courtrooms and prisons.
1.5. Pro: Cannabis has many positive medical applications.
1.5.1. Pro: Cannabis can be legalized to eat or take in refined forms, such as CBD/THC oil, pills, et cetera. These are healthy medicines and/or recreational chemicals.
1.5.2. Pro: Cannabis can help reduce the opioid epidemic in the US.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The cannabinoid and opioid receptors in the brain rely on [common signaling pathways](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana-medicine), including the dopamine system that is vital to dependence, drug tolerance and addiction.
1.5.2.2. Con: Substituting one drug for another may simply transfer addictions to another substance.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: [Cannabis withdrawal](https://luxury.rehabs.com/drug-detox/marijuana-withdrawal-symptoms/) is similar to withdrawal from [coffee](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-withdrawal-symptoms-top-ten), whereas opioid withdrawal is worse than withdrawal from [alcohol](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/alcohol-withdrawal-symptoms-treatments#1).
1.5.2.2.1.1. Con: If used frequently, [cannabis](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/marijuana-rehab/withdrawal/#Withdrawal) withdrawal can exhibit some of the same symptoms of [opioid](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments/opiate/) withdrawal.
1.5.2.2.1.1.1. Con: People suffering from indigestion can also exhibit some of the same symptoms  which can occur with opioid withdrawal.  This does not seem like a valid reason to prohibit onion rings.[Opioids](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments/opiate/)   [Indigestion](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/indigestion/article_em.htm#what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_indigestion)
1.5.2.2.2. Con: When treating a chronic pain patient, risking marijuana addiction should be considered before risking opioid addiction.
1.5.2.2.3. Con: At the very least, Cannabis is healthier for the body.
1.5.2.2.4. Con: A substance which has no historical incidence of fatal ingestion vs. one that kills daily in the United States.
1.5.2.3. Con: [Opioids can be cheaper](http://kuow.org/post/high-cost-medical-marijuana-causes-pain-vermont) than cannabis with some insurance, and thus likely to be utilize more for health conditions. Its not likely that cannabis can be used widely enough to effectively reduce the epidemic.
1.5.2.4. Pro: A [study](https://www.sciencealert.com/93-of-patients-prefer-cannabis-over-opioids-for-managing-their-pain-according-to-new-study) shows that 93% of patients prefer cannabis over opioids for pain management.
1.5.2.5. Con: Current evidence is purely anecdotal.
1.5.3. Pro: Other currently legal substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and prescription opioids have far less positive impact on users health.
1.5.3.1. Pro: The illegality of cannabis is hypocritical to the legality of alcohol, considering [lower addiction rates](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-truth-about-pot/) of cannabis and the famous alcohol death toll compared to 0 deaths recorded from cannabis alone.
1.5.4. Pro: Cannabis, including hemp, has many applications in well-being, nutrition, construction, and textiles. Despite corporate propaganda and defamation, [natural cannabinoids](https://shop.northspur.co/blogs/news/guide-to-hemp-cannabinoids) have therapeutic value.
1.5.5. Pro: Cannabis is useful in treating epilepsy.
1.5.5.1. Con: There are [clinically proven medications](https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/news/20070322/best-first-choice-drugs-epilepsy-idd#1) that are just as beneficial in treating epilepsy.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: Processing resources usable in other medicaments to make a substance that has natural substitite with comparable effects does not seem reasonable.
1.5.5.1.2. Con: Some of those medications, statistically, [will be intolerable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28931473) to patients who have epilepsy, and marijuana may provide options for those patients.
1.5.5.2. Pro: [Terry Parker](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11365283) claimed it reduced his seizures in 1980:  families with epileptic children have moved to Colorado to seek medical asylum and pharmaceutical companies such a GW Pharmaceuticals has moved cannabis-based epilepsy treatment drugs past Phase 3 trials \(Epidiolex\).
1.5.5.3. Pro: Medicinal cannabis [decreased seizures](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/treating-seizures-and-epilepsy/other-treatment-approaches/medical-marijuana-and-epilepsy) by 54% on average in one study.
1.5.6. Pro: Several claims have been made throughout social media and blogs for the medicinal benefits.
1.5.7. Pro: Cannabis has been effectively used medicinally for thousands of years.
1.5.7.1. Pro: In 2737 B.C. marijuana was reportedly [first utilized](https://www.medicaldaily.com/brief-history-medical-cannabis-ancient-anesthesia-modern-dispensary-370344) medicinally by Emperor Shen Neng.
1.5.8. Con: Cannabis use can [increase risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3221171/#sec1-4title) of schizophrenia.
1.5.8.1. Con: This Longitudinal study indicates that the link may be correlative not causative. The conclusion ends with "The nature of the association between cannabis use and schizophrenia awaits further elucidation from research Into the biology of schizophrenia, but, at this point In time, based on the available evidence, it seems premature to claim that cannabis use causes schizophrenia."[Interpreting the association between cannabis use and increased risk for schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181719/)
1.6. Pro: Cannabis users do not risk physical addiction.
1.7. Pro: Cannabis use after the age of 16 does not permanently harm brain development. [brainhealth.utdallas.edu](https://brainhealth.utdallas.edu/starting-age-of-marijuana-use-may-have-long-term-effects-on-brain-developme/)
1.8. Pro: The prohibition on marijuana has led to negative outcomes.
1.8.1. Pro: Prohibition only generates more crime. Take, for example, the [alcohol prohibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States) in the United States during the 1920's and 30's. Banning alcohol created an entire new black market for crime. Today, a ban on alcohol would just seem crazy. I believe the same case for Cannabis.
1.8.2. Pro: There are [racial disparities](https://www.aclu.org/report/report-war-marijuana-black-and-white?redirect=criminal-law-reform/war-marijuana-black-and-white) in the enforcement of laws regarding marijuana sale and use.
1.8.3. Pro: Outlawing the sale of marijuana has [benefited cartels](http://www.newsweek.com/2018/01/19/mexican-drug-cartels-taking-over-california-legal-marijuana-775665.html).
1.8.4. Pro: Hemp is a versatile material which cannot be produced in the United States. This forces the United States to import a material it can make, which unduly puts America at an economic disadvantage.
1.8.5. Pro: Prohibition on marijuana has contributed to prison overcrowding. Nearly [14% of all inmates were convicted of marijuana charges.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/10/war-on-drugs-prisons-infographic_n_4914884.html)
1.8.5.1. Con: There are lesser punishments that can be implemented here in place of imprisonment, such as community service.
1.8.6. Pro: Prohibition on marijuana is a [gateway to harder drugs](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/inge-fryklund/prohibition-is-the-real-g_b_8210802.html).
1.8.7. Pro: Profits from illegal cannabis fund criminal organisations which use the money to commit other crime.
1.9. Pro: Cannabis is already legal in a majority of the states, medicinally and for recreational use.
1.9.1. Pro: In states that are fully recreational, there are great financial and tax benefits occurring.
1.9.2. Pro: Medicinal cannabis use is legal in [29 states](https://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881).
1.10. Pro: The legalization of marijuana has shown many benefits where it has been enacted. [chicagotribune.com](http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-colorado-marijuana-industry-20161031-story.html)
1.10.1. Pro: Legalizing cannabis has opened more job opportunities.
1.11. Con: Cannabis is a gateway drug into more hardcore drugs.
1.11.1. Con: It is unethical to imprison people for what they might do rather than for what they have actually done. We should not imprison someone before they use heroin, just in case they might do so later.
1.11.2. Con: In the same way that a tricycle is a gateway vehicle into motorcycles. It is only logical that people interested in altering their consciousness with a drug start with the least risky one. This doesn't mean that someone who uses marijuana is more likely to use other drugs because of their marijuana use. The relationship is incidental, not causal.
1.11.3. Con: Opioids found in doctors offices and medicine cabinets are the most hardcore gateway drugs, according to studies.
1.11.3.1. Pro: In [2016 alone](https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/about-the-epidemic/), 42,249 people \(116 people a day\) died from opioid overdose while 11.5 million people misused prescription opioids. In comparison, there have been [no known deaths](https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/drug_data_sheets/Marijuana.pdf) attributed to the use of cannabis.
1.11.4. Con: This is a widely accepted as a [myth.](https://www.thechristiantreatmentcenter.com/blog/myth-gateway-drugs/)
1.11.5. Con: -> See 1.11.3.1.
1.11.6. Con: [A study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/dar.12323) shows 87% of medical marijuana users in Canada used cannabis in place of alcohol, illicit drugs or prescription drugs, suggesting it is more of a gateway 'out' than a gateway 'in'.
1.11.7. Pro: Cannabis is easily accessible which may open access to drugs that are not as easily obtainable.
1.11.7.1. Con: Actually, the opposite is true. When cannabis is available at the local state regulated weed store people will have less incentive to seek out dangerous drug dealers who may offer other substances. There is no reason to risk buying weed from a gun toting gang banger when you can just buy it from the friendly legal pot shop.
1.11.8. Pro: If someone enjoys the feeling experienced with cannabis, they may become curious about other drugs.
1.11.8.1. Con: Curiosity is not a crime.
1.11.8.2. Con: There is no basis to back up this claim. A well educated society would know the differences between cannabis and a dangerous drug \(e.g. an opioid such as Fentanyl\) just as we see a difference between alcohol and severly dangerous drugs \(e.g. Fentanyl\).
1.12. Pro: Legalization would allow cannabis consumers to participate in a well-regulated market.
1.12.1. Con: Restrictions on legal marijuana purchases drive some consumers to additionally buy from black market dealers.
1.12.1.1. Con: Some people buy credit card numbers from the black market, but that doesn't mean credit cards should be outlawed.
1.12.2. Pro: In a legal cannabis market, the States gain large tax revenues. "The emerging industry took in nearly $9 billion in sales in 2017, according to Tom Adams,..." [money.cnn.com](http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/31/news/marijuana-state-of-the-union/index.html)
1.12.3. Pro: Legalizing cannabis allows users to choose a product that is both clean and regulated for thc content. If you want a lighter or stronger high, user has control.
1.13. Con: Legalizing marijuana lets children think it's Ok to use at any age.
1.13.1. Con: This creates a teaching moment for parents to talk to their children about the benefits of Cannabis.
1.13.2. Pro: Legalizing it may take the stigma away, allowing children who otherwise wouldn't use it, to give it a try.
1.13.2.1. Con: When its seen as rebellious and adventurous, cannabis does not have a stigma with children. Quite the opposite. When its commonplace and normalized children are less compelled to try it out of youthful rebellious disobedience.
1.13.2.1.1. Pro: In places where it is legal, underage use has decreased.[seattletimes.com](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/marijuana/more-washington-kids-arent-using-pot-even-though-its-legal-new-study-says/)
1.13.2.2. Con: Children still \(generally speaking\) view cigarettes and alcohol with a stigma, since it is still illegal for children to use them. Therefore it is not reasonable to claim that the stigma of cannabis will vanish for children.
1.13.3. Con: Legality does not imply that its use is unregulated. Alcohol and tobacco are legal and regulated.
1.13.4. Con: Children lose trust in authority figures when they learn that prohibition and government sponsored anti-marijuana campaigns are not truthful/accurate.
1.13.5. Con: Children understand that there are many activities reserved for adults.
1.13.6. Con: Children need to be taught. Today, they believe cannabis is okay to use because they have easier access to it than most adults. Parents must teach children.
1.13.7. Con: With legalization, we can promote education. Education has been proven to reduce underage use of substances like alcohol and tobacco.
1.13.8. Con: Childrens' thoughts should not be the basis for the legal persecution of peaceful adult activity. If that were the case then we could justify banning adult sex because it is not ok for children to have sex at their age.
1.14. Con: Legalizing cannabis increases cost for the tax payer.
1.14.1. Con: The Netherlands gain[€400 million a year](https://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/2008/may/09/europe_dutch_marijuana_tax_reven) from marijuana.
1.14.2. Con: Costs of law enforcement would decrease by not having to incarcerate or arrest users of cannabis.
1.14.3. Con: If cannabis can help with health challenges, its cost may offset what is saved in medical tax.
1.14.4. Pro: Tax costs for cannabis is some states range from [2.75% to 15%.](https://taxfoundation.org/state-marijuana-taxes-2018/)
1.15. Con: Legalizing cannabis will increase deaths and accidents of those under the influence.
1.15.1. Con: Cell phone use much more dramatically increased traffic fatalities. [25% of all traffic accidents](https://www.edgarsnyder.com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics.html) are a result of texting while driving. Yet no one suggests that we ban cell phones and imprison anyone who sends a text message at any time, even when they are not driving.
1.15.1.1. Con: The comparison to cell phones is totally off base; we don't suggest banning cell phones because they are a crucial part of most people's everyday modern lives, unlike marijuana.
1.15.1.1.1. Con: For those with medical issues, such as PTSD or epilepsy, cannabis is a crucial part of their lives.
1.15.2. Pro: Unlike alcohol, a reliable roadside test for THC or other cannabinoids has not been well-established.
1.15.2.1. Con: Officers are trained and can be better trained to identify signs of intoxication.
1.15.2.2. Con: Blood alcohol levels correlate very well to the degree of driver impairment. This is not the case with THC where tolerance varies a lot between users. Police should assess driver impairment rather than setting an arbitrary limit, as is the case for prescription medication, driver fatigue etc
1.15.3. Pro: Marijuana-related [traffic deaths](https://www.rmhidta.org/html/FINAL%202017%20Legalization%20of%20Marijuana%20in%20Colorado%20The%20Impact.pdf) increased 66% in Colorado in the 4 years following legalization \(pg 13\).
1.15.3.1. Con: Page 17 of the source states that the 66% growth is a growth of 80 people per year. Though all humans lives are important, this argument is weak considering there are many other deaths  that are more controllable such as distracted driving and driving under the influence of alcohol.
1.15.3.2. Con: Only some coroners test for THC, the primary active ingredient in cannabis, and therefore the true rates of cannabis involvement in vehicle accidents both prior to and following legalization are unknown. Following legalization, it likely became more common to test for it. [\(Denver Post, see p. 28\)](https://www.rmhidta.org/html/FINAL%202017%20Legalization%20of%20Marijuana%20in%20Colorado%20The%20Impact.pdf)
1.15.3.3. Con: The increase in the proportion of marijuana-related traffic deaths could merely mean that more people are using the drug -- not necessarily that more people are under the influence of marijuana when involved in fatal traffic accidents. [The definition of “marijuana-related” in the report makes it difficult to draw conclusions from the traffic fatality data](https://www.factcheck.org/2016/08/unpacking-pots-impact-in-colorado/)
1.15.3.4. Con: The American Public Health Association has a study that concludes. " Three years after recreational marijuana legalization, changes in motor vehicle crash fatality rates for Washington and Colorado were not statistically different from those in similar states without recreational marijuana legalization. Future studies over a longer time remain warranted."[Crash Fatality Rates After Recreational Marijuana Legalization in Washington and Colorado](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2017.303848)
1.16. Con: Organized crime and marijuana black market benefit from legalization.
1.16.1. Pro: In Colorado, where marijuana use is legal for medicinal and recreational use, the illegal market for it is [thriving](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/07/30/inside-colorados-flourishing-segregated-black-market-for-pot/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.378a1068161a).
1.16.1.1. Pro: State and sales tax is approximately 30%, leaving those in lower income brackets to buy at a more affordable price, even if it is illegal.
1.16.1.1.1. Con: This is not an argument against legalization. It is actually an argument in favor of legalization, because the black market must keep prices low to compete with the legal market. That means the black market supply chain makes less money.
1.16.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.12.1.
1.16.1.3. Con: This indicates a need to modify laws to allow the market to function rather than a need to keep it illegal.
1.16.1.4. Con: The entire black market supply chain \(growers, distributors, dealers\) has been weakened because it has had to reduce prices in order to compete with the legal supply chain. [forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/debraborchardt/2017/01/31/marijuana-prices-fall-in-2016-as-growers-flood-the-market-with-pot/#6d73e0c22f7f)
1.16.2. Pro: Buying from a black market dealer can be more convenient.
1.16.2.1. Pro: Some black market dealers offer discrete delivery services that make [acquiring](https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/economy/black-market-weed-keeping-legal-market-afloat/) the product easy and private.
1.16.2.1.1. Con: In Washington [many](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=marijuana+delivery&find_loc=Seattle%2C+WA) legal weed stores also deliver cannabis to your door, just like pizza \(which you may also need for the munchies\).
1.16.2.2. Con: Anything a black market dealer does to make purchases convienant, can also be done by legal dealers.
1.16.2.2.1. Pro: Legal dealers can also provide a delivery service for customers to offset travel.
1.16.2.3. Con: In Washington you can walk three blocks from almost anywhere and find a store that contains 100 varieties of flower, extracts, edibles in solid and liquid, topical creams, vaporizers and glassware, vape pens, and pre-rolled joints all labeled and scientifically tested in a lab for potency and quality at reasonable prices. This is much more convenient than choosing from two or three bags of whatever-weed that a black market dealer might have at any one time.
1.16.3. Pro: In parts of Washington, the Cannabis Patient Protection Act \(SB-5052\) requires [medical dispensaries](http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/four-years-after-legal-weed-seattles-black-market-still-thrives/) obtain a I-502 license to offer recreational products. After issuing only 222 licenses, many medical dispensaries had to turn to black market to obtain their marijuana.
1.16.3.1. Con: The medical model in Washington state is no longer in operation. It was [replaced](http://mrsc.org/getdoc/8cd49386-c1bb-46f9-a3c8-2f462dcb576b/Marijuana-Regulation-in-Washington-State.aspx) by a fully recreational market where anyone over 21 can buy a wide assortment of cannabis products. Clearly, the solution was greater permissiveness, not less.
1.16.4. Con: Increased competition from legal providers will reduce prices, for both illegal and legal products.
1.16.5. Con: Legal providers have the advantage of being able to research openly, recruit skilled chemists, and distribute openly.  Black market producers have a disadvantage against that, causing them to fall behind.
1.16.6. Con: -> See 1.3.
1.16.7. Con: Organized crime would not benefit from legalization because they cannot be the source for the marijuana in question. Without that control, they are essentially competing with legal sources, and this would actually push them out of the market.
1.16.8. Con: High tax rates on legal cannabis can create a boom for black market business.
1.16.9. Con: Benefiting the black market is not a justification for legally convicting people for simply consuming THC.
1.16.10. Con: Drug cartels want cannabis to be illegal. The black market profits most when there is no legal alternative. [Legalizing Marijuana Would Hurt Mexican Drug Cartels More Than Trump's Border Wall](https://reason.com/blog/2017/02/03/legalizing-marijuana-could-hurt-mexican)
