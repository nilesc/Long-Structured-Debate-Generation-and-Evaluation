Discussion Title: Should Laptops be Allowed in University Classrooms?

1. Laptops should be allowed in the classroom.
1.1. Pro: The use of laptops and other devices is already an integral part of today's education experience. The clock cannot be turned back on this reality.
1.1.1. Pro: Surveys show that nine out of ten American college students already own a laptop and use it for college work; three out of four do so every day \([Pearson, p. 21, 27, 31](http://www.pearsoned.com/wp-content/uploads/2015-Pearson-Student-Mobile-Device-Survey-College.pdf)\).
1.1.2. Pro: According to surveys, half of all American college students name a laptop for their favorite device to do homework or projects with other students, far ahead of other devices and analog means \([Pearson, p. 28](http://www.pearsoned.com/wp-content/uploads/2015-Pearson-Student-Mobile-Device-Survey-College.pdf)\).
1.1.3. Pro: The prevalence of laptops and other devices outside schools shapes how students interact with information. Schools should not reject this reality but capitalize on it.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The use of laptops in class not only teaches students how to use the devices but also how to use them simultaneously with face-to-face interaction. In many professions this kind of multitasking is of growing importance.
1.1.4. Pro: Computers and the internet are widely credited with advancing or even revolutionizing education. It would be absurd to keep these benefits out of the classroom.
1.1.5. Con: Just because laptops are now integral to activities like accessing learning resources or completing assessments, it does not follow that they cannot be put away for classroom activities.
1.1.5.1. Con: But putting they away from classroom activities does follow not accessing those learning resources during those activities
1.1.6. Pro: I teach in a university. Students nowadays use electronic devices in their everyday lives, so it would be pointless for me to expect them not to bring them to class. I have to find ways of a\) keeping the lesson interesting and interactive so students don't end up looking at Facebook and b\) using these devices for learning in the classroom.
1.1.7. Pro: If you ban laptops from the college classroom, then the students will simply use their phones to do the same thing.
1.1.7.1. Con: Typing lecture notes on a phone is not the same as on a laptop. Transcribing on a keyboard of a phone is very difficult and time-consuming where-as typing on a laptop is much more efficient. Therefore there is no reason to assume that students would use their phone for this purpose if laptops would be banned.
1.1.7.2. Con: Phones are a less capable and less efficient tool than laptops.
1.1.7.3. Pro: Phone are, by their nature, more engaging and reinforce heavier dependencies. Therefore, using them instead of laptops can lead to more distraction
1.2. Pro: Laptops allow students with learning preferences and requirements different from those encouraged by traditional means to thrive without interfering with the learning of those who do not use laptops.
1.2.1. Con: Laptops can be distracting to other students as well as the teacher.
1.2.1.1. Con: There are ways to mitigate this problem, for example by placing laptop users in a separate section of the classroom.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The authors of one study restricted laptop use to one side of the classroom. In a survey, students attitudes towards this zoning policy improved after experiencing it in action; the majority supported it \([Aguilar-Roca et al., p. 1305](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512001236)\).
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Internet access could furthermore be limited to minimize distraction, for example by blocking certain sites.
1.2.1.1.3. Pro: One professor banned laptops in the front rows of her classroom and cites the generally positive responses by students \([McCreary, p. 1083](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1280929)\).
1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: As the author of the referenced paper describes, the two front rows of her class were therefore laptop-free and the remaining six rows occupied mostly by laptop-users. The majority of students are therefore still exposed to the view of other students' laptops \([McCreary, p. 1083](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1280929)\).
1.2.1.2. Pro: Especially powerful laptops tend to be audible due to their fan noise, which can be distracting.
1.2.1.3. Con: These kinds of distractions resemble many other real-world environments - for example office settings - and thus provide a chance to learn how to cope with them for affected students.
1.2.1.4. Con: Students have no problem working in libraries where many are typing away on their laptops.
1.2.1.5. Con: This problem can be mitigated if the professor announces to students when they can utilize their laptops in class and when they are asked not to do so.
1.2.1.6. Con: Its important that students \(teens/young adults\) are able to learn to control themselves and stop distractions rather than rely on a "larger force" to do it for them.
1.2.1.7. Pro: The noise of typing on keyboards can be distracting and annoying.
1.2.1.7.1. Con: The scratch of pens and rustle of paper can be just as loud as modern laptop keyboards.
1.2.1.7.2. Con: In office settings, pretty much every other source of noise is described as more distractive than keyboards, and especially so other peoples' conversations \([Banbury/Berry, p. 31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15764304)\).
1.2.1.7.3. Pro: Seven out of ten students in one survey named keyboard tapping as the reason for why they get distracted by other students' laptop use \([Borbone, p. 50](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/record/uuid:705bbc3f-c9aa-4c22-b947-a61eda4ee570)\).
1.2.1.8. Pro: Many students, and especially those who do not use laptops, support the segregation of laptop users into a specific zone of the classroom \([Aguilar-Roca et al., p. 1306](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512001236)\).
1.2.1.9. Pro: In one survey, almost half of all students indicate that they are bothered, annoyed or distracted by the laptop use of other students \([Borbone, p. 55](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/record/uuid:705bbc3f-c9aa-4c22-b947-a61eda4ee570)\).
1.2.1.10. Pro: The bright screens of laptops and the contents they display can be distractive, and especially so when classrooms are darkened, for example during presentations.
1.2.1.10.1. Pro: This problem is exacerbated as laptop screens - in contrast to many other sources of distraction - do not lie flat on the table and are therefore visible to students sitting behind the laptop user \(see [Yamamoto, p. 488](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1078740)\).
1.2.1.10.2. Pro: Especially students who do not use laptops themselves tend to get occasionally distracted because they look at the laptop screens of other students \([McCreary, p. 1029](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1280929)\).
1.2.1.10.3. Pro: Seven out of ten students in one survey named curiosity as the reason for why they get distracted by other students' laptop use \([Borbone, p. 50](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/record/uuid:705bbc3f-c9aa-4c22-b947-a61eda4ee570)\).
1.2.1.10.4. Pro: The academic performance of students who were exposed to students \(by sitting behind them\) who are using a laptop and multitasking on it was worse than the performance of students without a laptop in sight \([Sana et al., p. 29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002254)\).
1.2.1.10.5. Pro: Many law students in one survey described the laptops used by other students as a source of distraction, especially due to non-class-related activities \([Yamamoto, p. 487-488](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1078740)\).
1.2.1.11. Pro: No other factor has been described by students themselves as more distracting in classroom lectures than the laptop use of other students, including the talking and fidgeting of other students and one's own laptop use \([Fried, p. 911](http://cpr.molsci.ucla.edu/cpr/data/library/400242/resources/res012/file/Computer%20Laptops%20Interfere%20with%20Lecture%20Learning.pdf)\).
1.2.2. Pro: Surveys indicate that about eight out of ten students would like to use a laptop a lot during the next school year, indicating students' appreciation of the technology in classroom settings \([Pearson, p. 47](http://www.pearsoned.com/wp-content/uploads/2015-Pearson-Student-Mobile-Device-Survey-College.pdf)\).
1.2.2.1. Con: In one study, students indicate that they utilize a laptop in class regardless of what they believe their preferred learning style is. This implies "relatively uninformed decisions" about whether laptop use serves their learning \([Murray, p. 217](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761358)\).
1.2.2.1.1. Con: That students gravitate towards using laptops as a learning tool could equally suggest that laptops are an effective learning tool regardless of preferred learning style.
1.2.3. Pro: Many college students, as digital natives, type faster than they can write on paper \([Horne et al., p. 7](https://www.lucid-research.com/documents/research/paper_jrnl_EducationalAndChildPsychology11_ComputerisedAssessmentOfHandwritingAndTypingSpeed.pdf)\).
1.2.3.1. Con: The speed of taking notes is in no way a reflection of the benefits laptops could bring to note-taking or learning. Taking more/faster notes is not equal to taking better notes \(quantity/quality\). In some studies it is shown that students who note by hand take better notes \(in regards to learning results\) than digital note-takers \([2014, Mueller, Oppenheimer](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614524581)\).
1.2.4. Pro: Tools for in-class use can allow students to ask questions without disrupting the lecture and without so doing in front of others, for example if they are shy \([Shaw at al., p. 9](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/rlt.v23.27197)\).
1.2.4.1. Pro: In addition, laptops create the opportunity for students to participate in an anonymous fashion which can encourage those who are shy or insecure - or hold contentious views - to engage with teachers and other students.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Beyond that, the questions students ask and the discussions they have via laptops are usually saved and can be accessed later, thus making them valuable beyond the time spent in the classroom.
1.2.5. Pro: Software-based testing and instruction can more effectively adapt to the needs and pace of each individual student.
1.2.5.1. Con: This is a different form of teaching and would not necessarily take place in a class-room environment. MOOCs can indeed be followed on a laptop but this should not be done in a lecture-environment as this is a very different didactic method.
1.2.6. Pro: Students with disabilities can use laptops to overcome problems they might otherwise have in the class room. Examples are programs for blind people that read documents to them as well as Speech synthesizers.
1.2.6.1. Con: Just like students with disabilities are accommodated in other ways, so could they be except from any general ban of laptops in classrooms.
1.2.7. Con: This assumes that learning is an individual and isolated activity. It doesn't properly take into account when laptops become a distraction for students from engaging with others in participatory learning through group activities.
1.2.7.1. Con: Not using a laptop does not ensure engaging with others
1.2.8. Con: Learning preferences \(visual, aural, etc.\) [have been debunked](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0098628315589505) for the vast majority of adult learners.
1.2.9. Con: The majority of students using laptops do not have requirements for their use other than \(perceived\) personal ones.
1.3. Con: Laptops distract their user from the classroom lecture.
1.3.1. Con: Several studies indicate that, though laptops encourage class-unrelated activities, students also perceive their use in combination with programs designed for classes to benefit their attention and engagement \([Samson, p. 15, 16](http://serc.carleton.edu/files/NAGTWorkshops/online2010/discussions/deliberate_engagement_laptops_.pdf); [Shaw et al, p. 8](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/rlt.v23.27197); [Zhu et al., p. 2](http://www.crlt.umich.edu/sites/default/files/resource_files/CRLT_no30.pdf)\).
1.3.2. Con: While students disagree about whether a laptop ban makes them more attentive, they answered in one study that it does, at least, not harm their attention \([McCreary, p. 1034](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1280929)\).
1.3.3. Con: As students attend university voluntarily and pay for it, is is their prerogative to make the mistake of letting themselves get distracted during class.
1.3.4. Con: If students want to distract themselves, they can do just as well using their phones, a book or some printed text that they want to read. Distractions in class have been available long before laptops came along.
1.3.4.1. Con: A book or printed text are not comparable to the distractions that come from internet-connectivity \(or the pressure people feel nowadays from being connected to social media\). The treshold for starting an activity like reading while in class is a lot higher than 'guickly' glancing or checking at your screen. Reading is considered to be more of an activity you need to concentrate for while 'checking' social media or the internet is seen much more as a momentary, small task.
1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.
1.3.6. Con: If students feel that they are distracted from the class because of their laptop, they can always choose to not use it.
1.3.6.1. Con: It is enormously difficult to forgo short-term distractions and pleasures. Students engage in a lot of behaviors that they know that their might go against their interests in the long-term, for example not doing their homework.
1.3.6.2. Con: The issue of banning laptops in educational settings is related to the concept of [nudging](https://behavioralpolicy.org/what-is-nudging/) which aims at directing people's behaviour away from actions that might be detrimental for them even though they might enjoy a certain activity. Of course there is always free will but assuming the student takes a class to obtain a diploma and the 'will' for a diploma is greater than that of wanting to see the latest cat video, nudging might be an acceptable practice.
1.3.7. Con: The use of laptops for distraction is not the problem but a symptom of a problem.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Especially in the context of colleges, where tenured professors have few incentives to teach in an engaging style, laptops and the distractions they provide to students can be a measure for the quality of teaching.
1.3.7.2. Pro: This is especially true in the context of university settings where students attend voluntarily and pay. Naturally, this gives them an incentive to make the most of their time - yet many find laptops apparently more appealing than what is on offer in class rooms.
1.3.7.3. Con: Lectures are not for entertainment purposes and the urge to distract oneself is therefore unavoidable. Laptops makes it easier to act upon this urge.
1.3.7.3.1. Pro: As a law school professor puts it, his lectures "can never rival the entertainment value of the web" \([Yamamoto, p. 487](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1078740)\).
1.3.7.4. Pro: In a surveys among law students, up to half of those who use their laptops for non-class-related purposes cite boredom as the reason \([McCreary, p. 1023](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1280929); [Murray, p. 210](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761358)\).
1.3.7.5. Pro: More than half the students in one survey named boredom as the reason for why they get distracted by other students' laptop use \([Borbone, p. 50](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/record/uuid:705bbc3f-c9aa-4c22-b947-a61eda4ee570)\).
1.3.8. Pro: Students themselves name no other factor as comparably distracting during classroom lectures as the use of a laptop, either by oneself or other students \([Fried, p. 911](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131506001436)\).
1.3.8.1. Pro: In a study of MIT engineering students equipped with laptops, the distractive potential of laptops was cited among the disadvantages of their use in class by 15% of students \([Barak et al, p. 253](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15391523.2006.10782459)\).
1.3.9. Con: The negative aspects of using laptops can be mitigated by providing an environment conductive to that, for example by turning off the WiFi.
1.3.9.1. Con: Students can easily bypass this kind of restriction, for example via [tethering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethering) and the creation of a WiFi hotspot with their phone.
1.3.9.1.1. Con: It is possible for sure, but that would entail a very deliberate, conscious act to create WiFi, which students know will cause distraction. Students this eager to be online, could be addicted and need more specialized help as they will also face problems later in life if they cannot be disconnected for a couple of hours.
1.3.10. Con: Studies indicate that the majority of students believe that a laptop ban would either have no effect on their own class involvement or affect it negatively \([Borbone, p. 64](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/record/uuid:705bbc3f-c9aa-4c22-b947-a61eda4ee570)\).
1.3.11. Con: If students suffer from boredom in class, it is arguably better they distract themselves with a laptop than by distracting other students, for example by talking.
1.3.11.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.3.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.4.
1.3.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.5.
1.3.12. Pro: The use of laptops results in students' multitasking.
1.3.12.1. Con: There an upside to the distraction that laptops provide: they teach multitasking, a skill that is of ever more importance in many professions.
1.3.12.1.1. Pro: Especially the discipline to manage the instant gratification on offer via laptops and paying attention to more complex and dry matters is an important trait to acquire.
1.3.12.2. Pro: It is incredibly disrespectful to the teacher when students use their laptops during class to surf the web or engage in other non-class related activities.
1.3.12.3. Pro: In surveys, the majority of laptop users report surfing the web during lectures, and nine out of ten that they are checking their emails \([McCreary, p. 1020](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1280929), [Borbone, p. 46](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/record/uuid:705bbc3f-c9aa-4c22-b947-a61eda4ee570); [Murray, p. 210](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761358)\).
1.3.12.3.1. Pro: These numbers are corroborated by another survey where only 25% of participating students indicate that they use their laptop only for note-taking \([Risko et al., p. 279-280](http://libproxy.snu.ac.kr/9dd806d/_Lib_Proxy_Url/ac.els-cdn.com/S0360131513001218/1-s2.0-S0360131513001218-main.pdf?_tid=78f870d8-15ec-11e7-9857-00000aacb35d&acdnat=1490949284_4f3734ee4962e8c5333536d59709e913)\).
1.3.12.3.2. Con: At the same time, the vast majority of the students who participated in these surveys state that they also go online for class-relevant materials \([McCreary, p. 1021](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1280929), [Borbone, p. 43](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/record/uuid:705bbc3f-c9aa-4c22-b947-a61eda4ee570); [Murray, p. 211](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761358)\).
1.3.12.3.3. Pro: These numbers are likely to be even higher as other research indicates that students tend to under-report their laptop use that is not class-related \([Kraushaar/Novak, p. 249](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ893903)\).
1.3.12.4. Pro: Students indicate that email checking and the use of social networks as well as instant messaging services is what they see most commonly on other students' laptops, far ahead of class-related activities \([Borbone, p. 52](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/record/uuid:705bbc3f-c9aa-4c22-b947-a61eda4ee570)\).
1.3.12.5. Pro: According to one survey, two out of three windows that a student opens on a laptop during class can be classified as distractive \([Kraushaar/Novak, p. 249](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ893903)\).
1.3.12.6. Con: As researchers of students' laptop use admit, there is limited and mixed evidence that this kind of multitasking impedes academic performance \([Kraushaar/Novak, p. 249](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ893903)\).
1.3.12.7. Pro: Based on the time spent by students on multitasking and non-class-related activities, researchers see the potential for them to be "seriously distracted from learning the lecture material" \([Kraushaar/Novak, p. 249](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ893903)\).
1.4. Pro: Laptops are an easy method for students to organize their work. Allowing students to use a laptop makes it easier to keep all work in one place and frees up time for studying or other activities.
1.4.1. Con: Laptops are only easy for students to organise their work if they have good digital literacy skills. Not all students do. If they have limited digital literacy skills, a laptop is a poor device for organising work.
1.4.1.1. Con: Those students can simply use another tools to organize their work
1.5. Pro: Laptops allow for better note-taking.
1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.5.2. Pro: Handwritten notes are difficult to share among students. Notes written on a laptop can though easily be shared and compared.
1.5.2.1. Con: There is no proof that sharing of notes results in better academic performance. Therefore the argument that claims digital notes are easier to share is irrelevant to the reason why laptops should be banned from universities \(as they harm learning activities\).
1.5.3. Pro: Taking digital notes doesn't use paper and avoids the need to print out lecture notes/handouts, which is better for the environment.
1.5.3.1. Con: Environmental claims are not that easy. The electricity used for powering the batteries and the electricity/resources used for producing a laptop are also causing tremendous harm to the environment. Although the reduced use of paper can be beneficial, the entire result of this claim is uncertain and up to now we are not able to calculate the total extend of 'environmental damage'.
1.5.4. Con: The notes students take with laptops are worse than those they write by hand as they tend to transcribe lectures verbatim instead of processing them. Consequently, this hurts their learning \([Mueller/Oppenheimer, p. 1159](http://libproxy.snu.ac.kr/7ce359d/_Lib_Proxy_Url/journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614524581)\).
1.5.4.1. Con: Processing content involves connecting new content to old content. This is more easily done on a laptop, where previous notes can be amended and added to, than on paper.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: Structuring of notes taken during lectures is an important process of the learning/processing cycle and therefore should not be done simultaneously with absorbing new content. Attention that needs to be given to the 'structuring' is taken away from listening attentively to the lecturer, therefore causing harm to the intention of the lecture-environment.
1.5.4.2. Con: In some courses, for example with a focus on law, complete notes can be necessary as fragmentary ones are not sufficient for test preparation.
1.5.4.3. Con: As critics of this argument point out, different students may have different styles of note-taking and learning. Laptops allow those who prefer verbatim notes to effectively take them during class \([Murray, p. 202](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761358)\).
1.5.4.4. Con: In a study among law students, seven out of ten stated that they are not taking verbatim notes but rather processing and summarizing class contents \([Murray, p. 204](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761358)\).
1.5.4.4.1. Con: [Self-reported evidence](http://www.creative-wisdom.com/teaching/WBI/memory.shtml) is nowhere close to an accurate form of data-collection. The students might think their note-taking is not verbatim, this does not mean their notes are actually processed or summarized in a learning-advancing way.
1.5.5. Con: Students self-report that they utilize a laptop for note-taking first and foremost out of convenience. Those who are primarily interested in learning outcomes tend to take notes on paper \([Aguilar-Roca et al., p. 1304](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512001236)\).
1.5.6. Pro: Note-taking on a laptop allows the convenient revision and structuring of notes, and the linkage of notes with other materials, for example links to relevant online materials \(see [Murray, p. 205](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761358)\).
1.5.6.1. Pro: Tools like OneNote and Evernote help students to organize their notes, back them up and synchronize them across multiple devices.
1.5.6.2. Pro: If a lecturer uses PowerPoint presentations, laptops allow students to conveniently add comments to the slides.
1.5.6.2.1. Con: You do not need a laptop to annotate PowerPoint presentations, the presentations could also be printed beforehand and annotated by hand.
1.5.6.3. Con: Attention that is given to note-structuring during lectures is taken away from listening to what/how the teacher is giving the lecture. Therefore students will need to 'multitask' which will decrease the efficiency of both processes that are taking place.
1.5.6.4. Con: While listening to a lecture, it is quite impossible to focus on finding relevant online materials unless attention is divided and the scope/impact of the lecture will be diminished.
1.5.7. Pro: Students seem to appreciate laptops for the purpose of note-taking. In one survey, nine out of ten laptop users stated that they use the device for this purpose \([Murray, p. 211](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761358)\).
1.5.7.1. Pro: In one survey, three out of four laptops users self-reported that their lecture notes were not as good as usual in classes that ban laptops \([McCreary, p. 1035](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1280929)\).
1.5.7.1.1. Con: [Self-reporting](http://www.sciencebrainwaves.com/the-dangers-of-self-report/) is known to have many biases so it cannot be used as a solid argument.
1.5.7.2. Con: Students generally also appreciate nice weather, still they are advised to put on sun-block as sunlight might cause them harm \(sunburn, skin cancer...\). In this case, the banning of laptops is done because they might cause harm to their learning processes; irrespective of their 'feelings' toward the use of laptops.
1.6. Pro: There is little support for a laptop ban in classrooms among students.
1.6.1. Con: This is not necessarily an informed opinion. The use of laptops lowers students' satisfaction with their education.
1.6.1.1. Pro: In one study among business students, those using laptops reported a lower satisfaction with their education than those not using laptops \([Wurst et al., p. 1774](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131508000808)\).
1.6.1.2. Con: Studies pointing in this direction usually caution that these effects might grow weaker as students grow accustomed to and proficient in working with the new technologies at their hands \([Wurst et al, p. 1774](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131508000808); [Kay, p. 1278](http://faculty.uoit.ca/kay/files/pubs/emotions/Kay_2008_CAE_Emotions_ComputerKnowledge.pdf)\).
1.6.2. Pro: Surveys indicate that students prefers to do their homework and to work collaboratively on projects with other students with the help of laptops, and much more so than with other devices or without electronic devices \([Pearson, p. 28](http://www.pearsoned.com/wp-content/uploads/2015-Pearson-Student-Mobile-Device-Survey-College.pdf)\).
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.6.4. Pro: In one survey, less than 10% of students supported a laptop ban, regardless of whether they themselves use one to take notes or not \([Aguilar-Roca et al., p. 1306](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512001236)\)
1.6.5. Con: According to one study, about half of the students who generally do not use a laptop support restrictions on their use, and about a third a laptop ban \([McCreary, p. 1307](http://file:///C:/Users/Max/Downloads/43ValULRev989.pdf)\).
1.6.5.1. Con: In the same study's sample, almost 80% of participants state that they always use a laptop. The number of students who support a ban is, as a share of the total sample, therefore less than one in ten \([McCreary, p. 1018](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1280929)\).
1.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.
1.7. Con: The use of laptops in class negatively correlates with students' academic success.
1.7.1. Pro: One study has established a negative correlation between the length of students' web-browsing on their laptops in class and their academic success \([Grace-Martin/Gay, p. 102](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.92.4102&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\).
1.7.1.1. Con: At the same time, this study notes that laptop use does not necessarily impede academic success. The number of web-browsing sessions during class, for example, correlated with higher academic performance \([Grace-Martin/Gay, p. 102](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.92.4102&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\).
1.7.2. Pro: A study conducted among students in several economics classes, some of which were allowed to use laptops or tablets, some of which were not, concluded that computer devices seem to have a "substantial negative effect on academic performance" \([Carter et al, p. 25](http://seii.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SEII-Discussion-Paper-2016.02-Payne-Carter-Greenberg-and-Walker-2.pdf)\).
1.7.2.1. Pro: As the study emphasizes, these results hold even true for cases in which devices are used in a manner that allows the professor to monitor them, e.g. by having tablets lying flat on the desk \([Carter et al., p. 26](http://seii.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SEII-Discussion-Paper-2016.02-Payne-Carter-Greenberg-and-Walker-2.pdf)\).
1.7.3. Pro: A study among students in a psychology course concluded that the "success in the class was negatively related to the level of laptop use" \([Fried, p. 911](http://cpr.molsci.ucla.edu/cpr/data/library/400242/resources/res012/file/Computer%20Laptops%20Interfere%20with%20Lecture%20Learning.pdf)\).
1.7.4. Pro: A study of various laptop-optional classes at a school that requires students to own a laptop concluded that there are indications that laptop "use significantly worsens academic performance" \([Patterson/Patterson, p. 16](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/ilr.cornell.edu/files/CHERI%20WP173.pdf)\).
1.7.4.1. Pro: As the authors emphasize, they consider their study to be among the first to allow for conclusions about the causal linkage between laptop use and academic success \([Patterson/Patterson, p. 5](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/ilr.cornell.edu/files/CHERI%20WP173.pdf)\).
1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.
1.7.6. Con: If students feel that their academic success is in jeopardy because of laptops, they can always choose to not use them.
1.7.6.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.1.
1.7.6.2. Con: This fails to account for when students are unaware that laptop use is diminishing their academic performance, and that student instead attributes their diminished performance to their individual abilities.
1.7.7. Con: -> See 1.3.9.
1.7.8. Pro: Among students in a biology class, the percentage of laptop users earning A's was significantly lower than that of students not using a laptop \([Aguilar-Roca et al., p. 1306](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512001236)\).
1.7.9. Con: Studies that correlate laptop use with academic success are generally unable to establish a causal connection, as even the authors admit \([Aguilar-Roca et al., p. 1304](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512001236); [Fried, p. 911](http://cpr.molsci.ucla.edu/cpr/data/library/400242/resources/res012/file/Computer%20Laptops%20Interfere%20with%20Lecture%20Learning.pdf); [Carter et al., p. 25](http://seii.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SEII-Discussion-Paper-2016.02-Payne-Carter-Greenberg-and-Walker-2.pdf); [Kraushaar/Novak, p. 249](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ893903); [Murray, p. 221](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761358)\).
1.8. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.9. Con: The use of laptops in classrooms impedes students' learning.
1.9.1. Con: Students in a study on the use of laptops in combination with programs designed for class purposes indicated that they believe their learning benefited and that they learned more than they would have otherwise \([Samson, p. 17, 18](http://serc.carleton.edu/files/NAGTWorkshops/online2010/discussions/deliberate_engagement_laptops_.pdf); [Zhu et al., p. 3](http://www.crlt.umich.edu/sites/default/files/resource_files/CRLT_no30.pdf)\).
1.9.2. Pro: Using a laptop for non-class-related activities results in paying less attention to the lecture \([Risko et al, p. 279](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131513001218)\).
1.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.12.3.
1.9.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.12.4.
1.9.3. Con: Surveys indicate that more than half of all students believe that they learn best with the help of laptops and that they enjoy it the most compared to the use of other devices or the use of no electronic devices at all \([Pearson, p. 29](http://www.pearsoned.com/wp-content/uploads/2015-Pearson-Student-Mobile-Device-Survey-College.pdf)\).
1.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.9.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.
1.9.6. Con: If students feel that their learning suffers because of laptops, they can always choose to not use them.
1.9.6.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.1.
1.9.7. Pro: The memory performance of students using laptops in the classroom is worse than that of students not using laptops \([Hembrooke/Gay, p. 9](https://www.ugr.es/~victorhs/gbd/docs/10.1.1.9.9018.pdf); [Wood et al, p. 369](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131511002077); [Risko et al., p. 281](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131513001218)\).
1.9.7.1. Con: At the same time, this relationship is anything but clear. As researchers emphasize for example, this effect can be observed for Facebook use - but not for answering emails \([Wood at al., p. 372](http://libproxy.snu.ac.kr/9dd806d/_Lib_Proxy_Url/ac.els-cdn.com/S0360131511002077/1-s2.0-S0360131511002077-main.pdf?_tid=8fad2ea0-1451-11e7-a429-00000aab0f26&acdnat=1490772799_b304cbc6799d8d3a8ba0955d5277f433)\).
1.10. Pro: Laptops allow for more effective and engaging forms of tuition.
1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.10.2. Pro: Studies on the use of laptops with programs designed for use in classes indicate that students perceive them to improve the student-teacher relationship \([Shaw et al., p. 9](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/rlt.v23.27197)\).
1.10.3. Con: Laptop use harms the interactions between students and teachers.
1.10.3.1. Pro: Laptop screens block eye-contact between the lecturer and students \([Yamamoto, p. 489](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1078740); [McCreary, p. 995](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1280929)\).
1.10.3.1.1. Con: Students looking down at paper for notes are also not making eye-contact. Indeed touch-typing may mean that students using laptops make more eye-contact, rather than less.
1.10.3.2. Con: -> See 1.10.2.
1.10.3.3. Con: Laptops allow the real-time collection of data from students in class that can improve the communication with teachers.
1.10.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.10.3.3.2. Pro: Laptops make it easy for students to provide feedback on the activities of the teacher as well as those of other students, for example after presentations \([Weaver/Nilson, p. 8](http://web.mit.edu/jrankin/www/laptops/NDTL_Weaver.pdf)\).
1.10.3.3.2.1. Pro: Additionally, this can be done in an anonymized fashion which makes it easier to speak out and provide honest feedback.
1.10.3.3.3. Pro: Laptops make it easy for teachers to collect basic information from all students, for example about their majors, future career aspirations, reason for taking the course, expectations of the course, etc. \([Weaver/Nilson, p. 8](http://web.mit.edu/jrankin/www/laptops/NDTL_Weaver.pdf)\).
1.10.3.4. Con: Laptops, especially when used with special teaching tools, allow students to directly connect with other instructors or TAs during the class time \([Zhu et al., p. 3](http://www.crlt.umich.edu/sites/default/files/resource_files/CRLT_no30.pdf)\).
1.10.3.5. Con: Allowing laptops in class signals that teachers trust students and their judgments. This improves the relationship between them and does not create feeling of mistrust or paternalism.
1.10.3.5.1. Pro: Even educators [have branded](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/06/AR2007040601544.html) the idea of imposing a laptop ban as "paternalistic, authoritarian or worse" .
1.10.4. Pro: Teaching methods that allow students to interact with laptops during class and utilize them to engage with the subject at hand \(e.g. programming exercises\) have the potential to put the student and his/her progress at the center, not the teacher's lecture \([Barak et al, p. 255](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15391523.2006.10782459)\).
1.10.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.10.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.10.7. Pro: Laptops provide students with a convenient and fast way to look up information they do not have, for example the meaning of words or definitions of concepts, or simply to check facts they encounter in class.
1.10.8. Pro: Some teachers also like to keep their classroom environment interactive. By using laptops in class, students can take part in polls, surveys or other participatory activities in a way that is usually quicker and easier to organize. So, after hearing all of that, don’t you think laptop use in class is a marvelous idea?
1.10.9. Pro: Greater integration of technologies into classroom contexts takes the burden off instructors to produce engaging and informative lessons, and places that burden on the technology. This saves money, as it allows universities to employ less skilled and less experienced facilitators.
1.10.10. Con: If laptops aren't mandatory, teachers can't rely on using them for their class - that would be bad for the students who happen not to bring laptops.
1.10.11. Pro: Laptops help students with understanding material especially when they are not able to comprehend teacher.
1.10.12. Pro: Software-based testing and instruction can make use of rich media and interactivity which can lead to students gaining more insight into complex ideas.
1.10.12.1. Pro: Laptops enable the use of contents such as [learning objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_object) that allow students to learn by manipulating and observing instead of by merely watching a teacher's explanations \([Weaver/Nilson, p. 11](http://web.mit.edu/jrankin/www/laptops/NDTL_Weaver.pdf)\).
1.10.12.2. Pro: Among the benefits that engineering students at MIT cited after participating in a laptop-based programming class was that it allowed them hands-on real-world practice with the skills they learned \([Barak et al, p. 253](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15391523.2006.10782459)\).
1.10.12.3. Con: Digitalisation of the class-room also creates many problems and do not automatically lead to students gaining more inside as the distractiveness of digital media often overpowers the instructed content \([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/therootdc/post/the-problem-with-technology-in-schools/2013/01/28/cf13dc6c-6963-11e2-ada3-d86a4806d5ee_blog.html?utm_term=.7f27538ee4e7)\)
1.11. Pro: Laptops have the side effect of teaching students how to be productive with computers.
1.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.11.2. Con: If laptops mean less interactivity of students in the classroom, this has the side effect of reducing opportunities to learn and practice communication skills.
1.11.2.1. Con: Those opportunities may be fewer in number than the opportunities to learn and practice communication skills on-line.
1.11.3. Pro: Most students will be utilizing computers for the rest of their careers. Growing proficient with their use is therefore highly important.
1.12. Con: Laptops are either expensive for the school or for the student; requiring money that may be more critically needed elsewhere.
1.12.1. Con: Students being able to use laptops in class does not require that they do so.
1.12.2. Con: The expectation that students submit typed assignments, do research online and receive instructions and information via email and learning management systems functionally already requires students to have access to a computer.
1.12.2.1. Con: Computers used for these tasks need not be laptops that are brought to class. These computers can equally well be desktops students use at home or at a dedicated computer lab at the university, or computers borrowed from flatmates in the evening.
1.12.3. Con: According to surveys, nine out of ten students own and use a laptop already. Few would therefore feel any pressure to buy one \([Pearson, p. 20, 21](http://www.pearsoned.com/wp-content/uploads/2015-Pearson-Student-Mobile-Device-Survey-College.pdf)\).
1.12.4. Pro: Even outfitting a class of two dozen students with a 'cheap' [laptop aimed at education](https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/hp-chromebook-11-g5-deluxe-education-notebook-116-touch-intel-celeron-n3060-4gb-32gb-ssd-hp/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=product_listing_ads&gclid=CJGc2o_uvtMCFQ1hvQodKKkAWA) uses would cost nearly $10,000 USD.
1.12.4.1. Con: In most higher education systems, such a price doesn't have much impact on the total cost of the education fees.
1.12.5. Con: Most students nowadays use laptops for their personal use as much as for their studies, if not more. It is likely that not allowing laptops in classrooms wouldn't prevent them from purchasing one, and therefore wouldn't have a real impact of this outlay of money.
1.12.6. Con: Nevertheless, laptops could allowed. This doesn't necessarily means that students are required to bring in one, they just could.
1.12.7. Pro: This problem may be exacerbated by social pressure to bring a laptop. As one study indicates, many students decide to bring a laptop because their classmates do so and because this appears to be the norm \([Murray, p. 215, 216](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761358)\).
1.13. Pro: Adult students who pay for the education they receive should be able to make the decision of whether they want to use laptops in class on their own.
1.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.3.5.1.
1.13.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.13.3. Pro: Most college students can decide to buy a gun or enroll in the military if they want to. Prohibiting them from using a laptop in class is thus disproportionate.
1.13.4. Con: Enrolling in a course does not mean the student can make decision over the running of that course. They do not decide what curriculum is set, or how they are assessed, because it is assumed that teachers are better at judging these matters than students are. Why should it be different with the use of technology in the classroom?
