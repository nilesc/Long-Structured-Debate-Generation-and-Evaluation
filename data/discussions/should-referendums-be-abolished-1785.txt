Discussion Title: Should Referendums Be Abolished?

1. Democracies should not use referendums for policy decisions.
1.1. Con: Decisions taken via referendums tend to be perceived as more legitimate and find more acceptance in the population than decisions derived in other ways.
1.1.1. Pro: People are more willing to accept a result when they feel they had a role in making it.
1.1.1.1. Pro: In group experiments, decisions reached through participatory measures - for example deliberation, but especially voting - had a much higher perceived legitimacy than those without \([Persson, p. 393](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-political-science-review/article/effects-of-direct-voting-and-deliberation-on-legitimacy-beliefs-an-experimental-study-of-small-group-decisionmaking/940FC64F77F0AF646852DF16C0C979F0)\).
1.1.1.2. Con: There is evidence that participation in decision-making processes does not necessarily lead to a higher perceived legitimacy of the outcome. Among the factors that can affect the perceived legitimacy is, for example, whether one's participation had a visible effect \([Caripini et al, p. 322f.](http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1064&context=asc_papers)\).
1.1.1.3. Con: People also participate in elections, and thus indirectly have a role in all political decisions, even those made by politicians.
1.1.2. Pro: Referendums provide an important check on political decision-making between elections by ensuring that key changes only take place with popular support.
1.1.3. Con: Referendums are unable to capture the complexity of [non separable preferences](https://academic.oup.com/pan/article-abstract/9/2/95/1548180/Nonseparable-Preferences-Measurement-Error-and), which many voters might have. Therefore referendums may produce unstable collective choices that are opposed by a significant amount of voters \([Lacy/Niou, p.26](https://sites.duke.edu/niou/files/2011/06/referendum-JTP.pdf)\).
1.1.4. Pro: The people are the final source of legitimacy in a democracy. Thus, decisions made by them have greater legitimacy than decisions made for them by representatives.
1.1.5. Con: More 'legitimacy' can lead to the dogmatic believe that what the majority of voters voted for is the \(only\) right choice while this 'legitimacy' is solely based on an 'ad populum' fallacy.
1.1.5.1. Con: Democracy is based on a government acting out the will of the people. If the majority of the inhabitants want something that is "wrong" than the government should still do it. That is not an 'ad populum' fallacy but how the government should work.
1.1.6. Con: Referendums do not enable compromises, as only one side wins. This can lead to a political division of a country.
1.1.6.1. Pro: The ["Brexit" referendum](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron) created animosity between supporters and opposers.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: During the campaign in the run-up to the referendum, Remain campaigners reported being called [traitors and liars](http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2016-06/brexit-abstimmung-strassenwahlkaempfer-grossbritannien/seite-2) while canvassing in London, or not daring to openly wear Remain stickers in the North of England, where support for Brexit was high.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Some observers argue that the hateful rhetoric employed during the campaign divided the country so deeply that some people felt empowered to use violence, as evidenced by the [murder of MP Jo Cox](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/opinion/jo-cox-brexit-and-the-politics-of-hate.html), who supported Remain.
1.1.6.2. Pro: The search for compromise, tedious as it may be, has the potential to satisfy more stakeholders and overcome partisanship, neither of which referendums can achieve.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Referendums cannot create compromise because they only ask for approval and rejection. Political philosophers like Max Weber therefore [rejected them](http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/parlament-und-regierung-im-neugeordneten-deutschland-8127/7) as an element of democratic governance; he saw compromises as the foundation of most laws in modern states.
1.1.6.2.1.1. Con: There are plenty of examples of referendums that offered more than two binary options to voters \([Emerson, p. 163](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JQ5C5nazfjEC&pg=PA163&dq=%22The+world%27s+first+multi-option+vote%22+Emerson&hl=en&sa=X&ei=G2cQT4yNCMeyhAfDteWGAg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22The%20world's%20first%20multi-option%20vote%22%20Emerson&f=false)\).
1.1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Referendums that offer more than two binary options could be [easily misused](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000008414/multiple-choice-referendum-would-be-open-to-manipulation) to influence the outcome by confusing voters.
1.1.6.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: There is a lot of [controversy](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julio-pabon/statehood-vote-in-puerto-_b_2094586.html) about the 2012 Puerto Rico referendum. It has been argued that the only reason for more options on the referendum was to reach the outcome that the government wanted: statehood.
1.1.6.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Binary referendums can be equally manipulative, for example by wording their question in certain ways, as [was the case](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-05/hungary-s-manipulative-referendum) in the Hungarian referendum on refugees in 2016.
1.1.6.2.1.1.2. Con: Even referendums with more than two options are usually able to capture only part of the complexity of many issues.
1.1.6.2.1.1.3. Con: It does not matter how many options a referendum contains: In the end, only one side wins and the others lose.
1.1.6.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Simple maths argues that multiple options will split votes. Even if the options are balanced the voters could well end up voting in minority for one option that is contested by a majority of voters who split their votes yet the minority option still prevails.
1.1.6.2.1.1.4. Con: New Zealand used a multiple referendum process to debate having a new flag. This move has been widely attacked for not delivering options the voters would have actually supported. [Results show that the flag referendum was a 'major failure'.](http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2016/03/results-show-flag-referendum-a-major-failure---opposition.html)
1.1.6.2.1.1.5. Pro: Sweden held a [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_nuclear_power_referendum,_1980) in 1980 in which multiple policies regarding the country's nuclear power plants were proposed: two in favor of nuclear power, one against.
1.1.6.2.1.1.6. Pro: New Zealand decided in 1992 through a [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_reform_in_New_Zealand#1992_electoral_system_referendum) \(that was non-binding\) about its future election system. Voters could decide whether to replace the current system, and if they wanted to do so, between four alternatives.
1.1.6.2.1.1.6.1. Con: Even so, what sounded appealing on paper to the electorate has not necessarily translated into a system the electorate then embraces. NZ opted for the MMP \(Mixed Member Proportional\) system but [voter participation has been on decline despite this.](https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/322503/voter-participation-on-decline-despite-mmp)
1.1.6.2.1.1.7. Pro: Newfoundland decided in 1948 through a [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_referendums,_1948#Referendums) about its political future in relations to Canada and Great Britain, and whether it wanted to be independent from the two.
1.1.6.2.1.1.8. Pro: A decision about Finland's prohibition of alcohol was made in 1931 through a [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_prohibition_referendum,_1931). Voters were able to choose from complete prohibition, prohibition with exceptions for weak drinks and the abolition of prohibition.
1.1.6.2.1.1.9. Pro: The people of Puerto Rico decided in a [referendum in 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_status_referendum,_2012) about the territory's political status. Voters who decided in a first question for a change of the political status could then choose from three options: statehood within, independence from or free association with the United States.
1.1.6.2.1.2. Con: There are a number of issues that are just binaries e.g. whether or not same sex marriage should be legal, whereby compromising or finding a middle ground is impossible. This is true regardless of whether these issues are decided by referendum or traditional representative structures.
1.1.6.2.1.2.1. Con: Very few issues leave no room for at least some level of compromise. To continue the example of same sex marriage: civil unions have been used as a compromise \(e.g. Civil Partnerships in the UK\), and there are provisions in the Marriage \(Same Sex Couples\) Act that offer assurances to religious groups which represent a non-binary compromise.
1.1.6.2.2. Con: If the ruling party has a governing majority, it is unlikely that they will seek compromise instead of simply pushing through their preferred agenda.
1.1.6.2.2.1. Con: If one ruling party has the absolute majority, compromises are not sought in parliament between the political parties, but inside the faction of the ruling party. Large political parties often consist of many deputies with slightly different attitudes and convictions.
1.1.6.2.2.1.1. Pro: Although the Republicans have the majority in the American Congress, they have a hard time to disestablish Obamacare because of[factional disagreements](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/04/politics/health-care-vote/) between moderate and conservative party members.
1.1.6.2.2.1.2. Con: In Australia, the governing Liberal party combined moderate and conservative factions. The direction of the party caused conservative member Cory Bernardi to [quit](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-07/cory-bernardi-formally-quits-liberal-party/8247402) and form his own party instead of coming to a compromise.
1.1.6.2.2.1.3. Con: Political diversity within majorities, both within governing parties and within coalitions, can lead to extremism rather than compromise, as those from the center of the political spectrum have to appeal to the more extreme forces on either side to gain support.
1.1.6.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: Thus, the only way to achieve compromise is through the opposition party, and if the governing party has a majority, the opposition will lack any influence.
1.1.6.2.2.1.3.2. Pro: For example, [far-right parties in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/israel-coalition-deal-hard-right-government-avigdor-lieberman) dominate the agenda of the centre-right coalition, and Tea Partiers within Congress push mainstream Republicans to the right on [healthcare](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/04/politics/health-care-vote/).
1.1.6.2.2.1.3.3. Con: If someone in the center finds support from both extremes, they will pull both sides closer to the center. If they can only get support from one side, they probably weren't the center.
1.1.6.2.2.2. Con: Most governments are intrinsically reliant on compromises as they base their parliamentary majority on a coalition. As of 2015, [only three](http://www.cityam.com/215578/which-countries-eu-have-left-wingright-wing-governments-and-which-have-coalitions) out of the 27 European democracies were not governed by a coalition of parties.
1.1.6.2.2.2.1. Con: Negotiations with coalition partners do not necessarily result in what would traditionally be seen as "compromise." Rather, they often give disproportionate influence to small parties, who are allowed to monopolize certain areas of policy in exchange for their partnership.
1.1.6.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: In Israel, small far-right parties are often given control over [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naftali_Bennett#Political_career) or [settlement law](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21714355-more-choice-good-thing-within-limits-too-many-parties-can-spoil-politics) in exchange for their service as coalition partners.
1.1.6.2.2.3. Pro: Even if a government is based on a coalition, this simply means that two or three parties instead of one can push through their preferred agenda. If the coalition is stable, there is no need for them to engage in compromise with opposition parties.
1.1.6.2.3. Pro: Complex and potentially irreversible decisions are oversimplified by framing issues in the binary and asking voters to choose just one or the other.
1.1.6.2.3.1. Pro: Referendums tend to reduce the decision to yes/no \(in/out, legal/illegal\) options, failing on complex issues like Brexit: [iitm.be](http://iitm.be/changevsbrexit) . The simplification inherent in referenda decision is ideal for populists, who strive at "simple" answers.
1.1.6.2.3.2. Pro: Binary frames leave the public without influence on the implementation of the issue's outcomes.
1.1.6.2.3.2.1. Pro: The Brexit referendum offered almost no guidance on the actual [terms of Brexit.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-has-voted-to-leave-the-eu-what-happens-next)
1.1.6.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.3.1.
1.1.6.2.3.2.2. Con: At least referendums enable every voter to contribute to the initial decision before implementation. This still enables more participation than a political system without referendums, where those decisions are made by the tiny minority of people who are in government.
1.1.6.2.3.2.2.1. Con: The problem with this is that it gives an illusion of legitimacy to the decision. In actual fact, the politicians still have all the power of implementation.
1.1.6.2.3.2.3. Con: This problem exists with or without direct democracy. In both scenarios, politicians have to implement the policy.
1.1.6.2.3.2.4. Con: This is potentially a problem of there not being enough referendums rather than there being too many. If voters were also asked to vote on the details of Brexit this would have allowed a more nuanced answer on what Brexit actually should mean.
1.1.6.2.3.2.4.1. Con: If multiple referendums were necessary to determine the intricacies of policy, it would be unmanageable and unworkable.
1.1.6.2.3.3. Pro: Whoever has the power to define the question has the capacity to shape its outcome. For instance, there was [great controversy](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-21245701) about the wording of the question and the options for the 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum.
1.1.6.2.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.1.
1.1.6.2.4. Con: Even if this is true, it is sometimes the case that compromise simply cannot be reached, and in those cases a referendum would be preferable to a ruling party imposing a unilateral decision that is outside its mandate.
1.1.6.3. Con: In politics, it is always true that one side wins. The implementation of policies allows for some concessions to be made which can still happen with referendums.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: This may not be the case when, for example, slim victories are interpreted as a mandate for extreme implementations, as is the case with the demand for a "[hard Brexit.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/15/theresa-may-uk-is-prepared-to-accept-hard-brexit)"
1.1.7. Pro: When the majority vote is decisive, it gives the government a clear mandate to act in accordance with the referendum decision.
1.1.7.1. Pro: If the political opposition attacks a government policy that is based on a referendum, the government can refer to the popular vote to justify its decision.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Unsatisfied citizens can more easily protest against politicians' decisions and accuse them of illegitimacy than against decisions made by the people.
1.1.7.3. Pro: In democratic systems, political legitimacy is derived from [democratic approval](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimacy/#PubReaDemApp). A referendum decision expresses such democratic approval, which renders corresponding policy decisions politically legitimate and delegitimises critics.
1.1.7.4. Con: The same could be said of decisive victories in national elections.
1.1.7.5. Con: This assumes the vote is decisive. Given that referendums are often controversial, they frequently lead to quite close votes \(see [Brexit](http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results), [Australian republic](http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/referendums/1999_Referendum_Reports_Statistics/Key_Results.htm)\).
1.1.8. Con: If participation in a referendum is low its result can be seen as illegitimate.
1.1.8.1. Pro: The [median turnout](http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21699146-direct-democracy-spreading-across-europe-not-always-good-thing-referendumania) for nationwide referendums in Europe has fallen from 71% in the early 1990s to 41% in the past years.
1.1.8.1.1. Con: This is correlated heavily with the increasing number of referendums. Arguably, then, this simply reflects the fact that once you have more referendums, the marginal referendums are less important and therefore draw lower turnout, meaning that median turnout is lower. So even though median turnout has fallen, turnout could still be high for major referendums, eg [Brexit](http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results).
1.1.8.1.1.1. Pro: Additionally, public opposition to referendums could simply be opposition to these marginal extra referendums, rather than to the concept in general.
1.1.8.2. Pro: After the Brexit referendum, people called [for a second referendum](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-petition-second-eu-referendum-latest-news-vote-leave-a7104076.html), referencing low turnout.
1.1.8.3. Con: By this standard, the results of hardly any referendum can be labeled as legitimate in the sense that the majority of eligible citizens support its outcome.
1.1.8.3.1. Pro: Even a referendum like the one on Scottish independence in 2014, which had a [turnout of 85%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014) and a decisive victory for the no-side, saw only 46% of all registered voters supporting the result.
1.1.8.3.2. Pro: In the case of the Brexit referendum, only [about a third](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016) \(37%\) of eligible voters expressed their support for the result.
1.1.8.4. Con: By this standard, most elected governments are illegitimate as they do not have the expressed support of the majority of citizens eligible to vote.
1.1.8.4.1. Pro: Ever since popular vote numbers have been recorded, [not a single](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_by_popular_vote_margin) US President received the support of more than 42% of eligible voters.
1.1.8.4.2. Pro: Even a dominant coalition government like Angela Merkel's, which won [67% of votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_federal_election,_2013) in 2013, has the support of only 48% of registered voters.
1.1.8.4.3. Pro: The average member of the German parliament who got their seat through a direct mandate has the support of merely a third of the voters in their respective district \([Vehrkamp, p. 6](http://www.wahlbeteiligung2013.de/fileadmin/Inhalte/Studien/EINWURF_02_2013.pdf)\).
1.1.8.5. Con: In Switzerland, the difference between voter turnout for referendums and elections is marginal. For example, average turnout for national elections is [48.5%](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/politik.html), while turnout for national referendums is usually [around 45%](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_eidgen%C3%B6ssischen_Volksabstimmungen).
1.1.8.5.1. Con: Switzerland is a special case: the country has [more than a dozen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_referendums,_2016) referendums in many years, hence not all of them can be expected to be so relevant to large parts of the population that they elicit high turnout.
1.1.8.6. Con: This problem can be solved by introducing a minimum voter turnout for a referendum to be valid.  \([Gay, p. 14](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN02809#fullreport)\).
1.1.8.6.1. Pro: This was seen in a 2016 referendum on EU immigration in Hungary, where the results were considered [void](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/hungarian-vote-on-refugees-will-not-take-place-suggest-first-poll-results) due to a turnout of under 50%, despite 98% of those who turned out voting 'no'.
1.2. Con: Referendums strengthen the voters' position and therefore the foundation of democratic systems.
1.2.1. Con: Referendums are dominated by certain demographic and social groups, thereby giving them disproportional influence over political decisions. Politicians, on the other hand, can try to represent the people as a whole in their decisions.
1.2.1.1. Con: Politicians also typically have to respond to the influence of lobbyists for particular industries or groups that may have funded or backed their campaigns in other ways. This means they can be captured by even narrower interests than referendums.
1.2.1.2. Con: The fact that certain voter groups dominate referendums is hardly an argument against referendums as the alternative, that is: elections, equally suffers from this problem.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The voter turnout in Germany's general election in 2013 was higher in areas with a high levels of formal education, high income and little unemployment. Thus, the election's results were "not socially representative anymore" \([Schäfer et al., p. 4](http://www.wahlbeteiligung2013.de/fileadmin/Inhalte/Studien/Wahlbeteiligung-2013-Studie.pdf)\).
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: In American elections during the past decades, voter turnout has [reliably correlated](http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/demographics) with age \(the older, the more likely to vote\), education \(the more formal education, the more likely to vote\) and race \(Hispanics are less likely to vote\).
1.2.1.2.3. Pro: In the UK's 2015 general election, older people were [much more likely](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3575/How-Britain-voted-in-2015.aspx) to vote than younger people and voters of a high social class were much more likely to turn out than voters of a low social class.
1.2.1.2.4. Pro: In American elections, the turnout rate of white and black voters is usually above 60%, whereas that of Hispanic and Asian voters usually is below 50% \([Brookings. p. 7](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SOC2016report.pdf)\).
1.2.1.2.5. Pro: Higher turnout by older voters is observed in with [elections as well](http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/demographics), and is not a phenomenon specific to referendums.
1.2.1.2.5.1. Con: Older people are more likely to turn out because they have more time - i.e. are less likely to be working on election day, and are more stable in their jobs \(and so more able to take time off to vote if they are working\). When elections are relatively rare, younger people are more able to make the effort to get to the polls - regular referendums quickly exhaust their ability to do so.
1.2.1.2.5.1.1. Con: In many countries, elections and referendums are held [on weekends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_day) to ensure that a maximum number of citizens are able to participate.
1.2.1.2.5.2. Con: At least in the context of general elections there will always be a chance for younger voters to change things in a maximum of five years time. This is very rarely the case with referendums.
1.2.1.2.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.3.
1.2.1.2.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Voters from the working class are less likely to vote than voters who belong to higher classes.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: In the case of the Brexit referendum, there was a [correlation](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/how-did-turnout-affect-the-eu-referendum-result/) between social class and voter turnout, with people belonging to lower classes being less likely to vote.
1.2.1.4. Pro: Older people are significantly more likely to vote in referendums than younger people.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: In the Brexit referendum of 2016, elderly people were much more likely to vote and thus over-represented. Depending [on the](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/06/how-did-different-demographic-groups-vote-eu-referendum) [source](https://twitter.com/stephen501/status/746806362986975233), the turnout of voters aged 55-64 was 2.3 to 2.9-times as high as that among voters aged 18-24.
1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Turnout for the referendum was [higher than the last national election](http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results), so the result was arguably more representative of the public's will than the government is.
1.2.1.4.1.2. Con: Youth turnout in the Brexit referendum was [higher](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/09/young-people-referendum-turnout-brexit-twice-as-high) [than](http://www.if.org.uk/archives/6576/how-high-was-youth-turnout-at-the-2015-general-election) it was in recent national elections.
1.2.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.5.
1.2.1.4.3. Pro: According to surveys, voter turnout in the referendum on Scottish independence in 2014 was generally higher in older age brackets \(except for those aged 16-17\). Turnout among those in their 60s was 96% compared with 54% among those aged 18-24 \([Electoral Commission, p. 11](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/179807/Scottish-referendum-Public-Opinion-survey-ICM-Report-WEBSITE.pdf)\).
1.2.1.5. Con: While the demographics of the participation in referendums might not always be representative, all voters have at least the chance to participate. This is not the case for decisions made by parliament.
1.2.1.5.1. Con: All citizens have their chance to participate by voting at each election.
1.2.1.5.1.1. Con: This is a much more indirect form of participation than direct input on the topic being discussed.
1.2.1.6. Con: Politicians are not necessarily interested in representing the nation as a whole but, primarily, their constituents who vote for them. Their decisions can therefore equally be dominated by considerations of some demographic groups depending on the demographic composition of their constituents.
1.2.1.6.1. Pro: Some members of the US Congress [represent](http://proximityone.com/cd113_demographics.htm) an electoral district with a median annual income of 110.000$, others with a medium annual income of less than 24.000$.
1.2.1.6.2. Pro: Some members of the US Congress [represent](http://proximityone.com/cd113_demographics.htm) an electoral district where almost 70% of people have at least a Bachelor's degree, others where only 8% have one.
1.2.1.6.3. Pro: The vast majority of electoral districts in the East of Germany are far less rich than the average electoral district and face shrinking populations dominated by men. None of these problems are present in the electoral districts in the country's South \([Berlin Institut, p. 27, 29, 32](http://www.berlin-institut.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Die_demografische_Lage_2011/D-Engagement_online.pdf)\).
1.2.1.6.4. Pro: Many political decisions affect people in certain areas in different ways than people in other areas, hence the representatives of these people can hardly be expected to represent the nation as a whole.
1.2.1.6.4.1. Pro: In Germany, for example, the search for a nuclear waste depository has been [dragging on for decades](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-curse-of-gorleben-germany-s-endless-search-for-a-nuclear-waste-dump-a-672147.html), in part because no one wants it in their vicinity.
1.2.2. Pro: In countries that allow for legislative initiatives via referendums, legislators or other policy-makers often respond to the threat of referendums by being more responsive to popular demands.
1.2.2.1. Pro: There are a number of laws in the US that were passed due to pressure from citizens filing legislative initiatives, including laws making funding available for Medicaid, and restricting water pollution caused by toxic chemicals  \([Schmidt 1989, p. 26](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Citizen_Lawmakers.html?id=3L6kQgAACAAJ&redir_esc=y)\)
1.2.2.2. Con: Politicians already have to act according to popular demand as they can be voted out at the next election. There is equal ability to ignore these threats under both scenarios.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: It is questionable whether politicians are actually held responsible by voters. The percentage of members of the US Congress running for re-election who are defeated usually lies around 5% \([CRS, p. 6](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41545.pdf)\).
1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: This low turnover in Congress is especially puzzling as Congress' public approval rating is usually below 20%. Additionally, a third of Americans believe that their member of Congress is corrupt and about half believe that their member is out of touch and serves special interests \([Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx)\).
1.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: This low turnover exists despite the fact that [72%](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/april_2014/72_think_it_would_be_better_if_most_in_congress_are_not_reelected) of Americans said in 2014 that most representatives should not be re-elected, and only [25%](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/archive/mood_of_america_archive/congressional_performance/new_low_only_25_think_their_member_of_congress_deserves_reelection) said that their own representative deserves another term in office. This clearly shows the lack of accountability for members of the US congress.
1.2.2.2.1.3. Con: Even if there is some lack of turnover in Congress, there is at least the capability for accountability if they make awful decisions. This simply does not exist for individual citizens.
1.2.2.2.1.4. Con: Even though voters are oftentimes not informed about the precise voting behavior of their representatives, they manage to infer it - and, crucially, to hold their representatives accountable in elections \([Ansolabehere/Jones, p. 596](http://www.pejones.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ansolabeherejones_responses.pdf)\).
1.2.2.2.2. Con: Specific policies may only have marginal impacts on the chances of electoral success of a particular party, so politicians are only very indirectly accountable for their particular policies. By contrast, referendums provide a more direct mechanism of accountability.
1.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Referendums are mostly held on very major policies, meaning that if the government makes an unpopular decision on one of those policies, they may lose a few percentage points of popular support, which is often enough to tip the results of an election. Fear of this gives them an incentive to conform to public opinion.
1.2.2.2.3. Con: While voters are assumed to hold incumbents accountable for their whole term, they tend to have a short term memory. US voters, for example, vote based on how incumbents performed in the [year before the election](https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/in-looking-back-four-years-voters-have-short-memories/).
1.2.3. Pro: Referendums take decision-making power away from the party apparatus.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Without referendums, citizens have little leverage to effectively exert pressure on politicians between elections, since they can not be voted out of office.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: In extraordinary situations, citizens can always take to the streets and oust politicians through peaceful public pressure.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: In 2016, [hundreds of thousands](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/08/south-koreans-are-showing-the-world-how-protests-can-work/?utm_term=.2428aba51072) of South Koreans took the streets to demand President Park Geun-Hye's resignation. This pressure led to a successful [impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Park_Geun-hye) vote in parliament
1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: While public pressure initiated the process, it would not have been able to oust the President; Park's impeachment had to be based on her violating the law and/or the constitution, which the Constitutional Court [had to confirm](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/world/asia/park-geun-hye-impeached-south-korea.html?_r=0).
1.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: In 1972, Austrian civil society [stood up against the activation of the first Austrian nuclear power plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nuclear_movement_in_Austria) in Zwentendorf on the Danube. As a result of this pressure, the Chancellor announced a referendum on nuclear power, which resulted in a narrow majority against the Zwentendorf plant.
1.2.3.1.1.3. Pro: In 2009-2011 [the Icelandic financial crisis protests led to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Icelandic_financial_crisis_protests) the resignation of government officials and new elections. The newly elected government was supportive of the protestors, initiated a reform process and held several referendums to ask citizens about whether to pay the debt of their banks.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: Citizens should choose who to elect into office, and speak with their candidates about important issues.
A politician's career depends on being re-elected, so this is a viable and less expensive way to guide politics as a mere citizen.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Referenda enable a people to challenge the power structure in their country. In a lot of countries, all main-stream political parties share some interests. Referenda enable the voters to challenge these interests.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Referendums are based on single issues, so people are less likely to vote according to their usual political allegiance.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: A lot of people will take their cue from the opinions of politicians and other leaders they identify with. This is often easier than becoming informed themselves.
1.2.3.3.1.1. Con: Even if this is true, the result may still be deviations from political orthodoxy, as there may be divided opinion within a particular party - for example, consider both the [Labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Leave) and [Conservative](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/02/which-tory-mps-back-brexit-who-doesnt-and-who-is-still-on-the-fence/) parties with relation to the Brexit referendum.
1.2.3.3.2. Pro: Deliberation surrounding the Brexit referendum was concerned with trade, immigration, and national sovereignty, issues on which opinion does not vary solely along ideological lines.
1.2.3.3.2.1. Pro: Anti-immigration sentiment is traditionally associated with conservatism, but [many Labour voters](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/23/labour-traditional-voters-progressive-values-working-class-ukip) voted for Brexit out of a desire to restrict immigration.
1.2.3.3.3. Con: Much political science research suggests voters often use referendums as [as an opportunity to punish the ruling party](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/research/microsites/epop/pdfs/Laycock_-_The_Distinctiveness_of_Referendum_Voting.pdf) by voting them down, indicating that political allegiance can be extremely important for the way people vote in them.
1.2.3.4. Pro: Without referendums, party politicians are the only people who can put issues onto the political agenda.
1.2.3.4.1. Con: Various other actors can be successful in putting issues on the political agenda, from NGOs to lobbying groups, through innocuous processes such as [the provision of information](https://academic.oup.com/jleo/article/32/4/762/2503114/Informational-Lobbying-and-Agenda-Distortion#55067309).
1.2.3.4.2. Pro: For years, the German conservatives managed to [block a vote](http://www.newsweek.com/same-sex-marriage-lgbtq-germany-gay-rights-angela-merkel-630234) on legalising same-sex marriage using their parliamentary influence, despite popular approval \(83%\) and a parliamentary majority \(393-226\) for passing a corresponding bill.
1.2.3.4.3. Con: Political parties also have to be responsive to the electorate. If the electorate is agitating for a policy, then governments will follow up on those regardless of whether that society has referendums.
1.2.3.4.3.1. Pro: Even though most of them were non-democratic, almost two dozen African countries saw popular calls for political, social and economic reforms during the early 1990s and subsequent reforms \([Bratton/van de Walle, p. 419](https://www.jstor.org/stable/422153?sid=primo&origin=crossref&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\).
1.2.4. Con: Simultaneously, other important actors in the democratic system are weakened by referendums. This can undermine democracy.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Referendums destabilise and undermine political parties, an important institution of representative democracies.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Party members may take opposing sides in referendums and electors may ignore or even defy the party lead where it is given. This often leads to interparty schisms \([Kobach 1993, p. 132](http://www.ditext.com/kobach/referendum.html)\)
1.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: The Brexit referendum created significant splits within both the [Conservative](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2016/04/05/the-conservative-party-split-on-brexit/) and the [Labour Party](http://www.politico.eu/article/labour-split-over-attitude-to-brexit/).
1.2.4.1.2. Con: Even in Switzerland, arguably the country closest to a direct democracy, political parties [steadily remain](http://www.andreasladner.ch/dokumente/aufsaetze/West_European_Politics_2001_al.pdf) [a central actor in Swiss politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Switzerland#Political_parties_and_elections).
1.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: The introduction of the referendum in 1874 radically altered the Swiss system, from a radical single-party domination to a consensus system with four ruling parties. This fostered stabilization based on negotiation and compromise. \([Linder, p. 5](http://www.wolf-linder.ch/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Strengths-and-weaknesses-of-direct-democracy.pdf)\).
1.2.4.1.3. Con: The "destabilisation" of political parties forces them to be more responsive to the wishes of voters, which is a good thing.
1.2.4.1.3.1. Pro: Jeremy Corbyn's history of [euroscepticism](http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/661410/Jeremy-Corbyn-What-Say-EU-Past-Eurosceptic-Views-on-European-Union) was not much discussed by voters until the Brexit campaigning season forced him to take a public stance. When he expressed only lukewarm support, there was a swift [backlash](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-jeremy-corbyn-peter-mandelson-remain-campaign-eu-referendum-7176551.html). Thus, the referendum campaign forced the public to come to terms with aspects of his views.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1. Con: Despite this, Corbyn was not voted out, so the only result of the referendum was further [division](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-contest-opponents-failures) within the Labour Party.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Referendums weaken parliaments and [parliamentary sovereignty](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/sovereignty/), a central institution of democracy.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: If the executive could point towards referendums to justify actions than run counter to the parliament's intentions, this could effectively prevent parliament from keeping the executive in check.
1.2.4.2.2. Pro: Referendums detract from the legislative competence of parliament as decisions surrounding law or policy are made by the citizens instead of by their elected representatives.
1.2.4.2.2.1. Pro: The fact that referendums are mostly about fundamental political questions further downgrades the legislative role of parliaments as they are relegated to deciding only the least important issues.
1.2.4.2.3. Con: In systems with parliamentary sovereignty, referendums will only occur if parliament has at some point made a provision for it, for example the [European Referendum Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Referendum_Act_2015) of 2015.
1.2.4.2.3.1. Con: Although the parliamentary provision is a formal requirement, parliaments as political actors depend on public support. As a result, parliaments unlikely act against the will of the public in order not to lose reputation.
1.2.4.2.3.2. Con: If politicians control the availability of referendums, the benefits of referendums in terms of increasing popular sovereignty disappear entirely.
1.2.4.2.4. Pro: The "Brexit" referendum strengthened the [sovereignty of the people](https://www.ft.com/content/9b00bca0-bd61-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080) in the UK to the disadvantage of parliamentary sovereignty. Although there is no legal requirement, parliament is effectively subordinate to the people's will.
1.2.4.2.4.1. Con: The Brexit win was in large part driven by the desire to increase the power of the UK parliament by taking back the power it had seceded to Europe.
1.2.4.2.4.2. Con: As the UK Supreme Court [ruled](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38720320), the actual Brexit process has to be approved and initiated by parliament. In that sense, the popular will did not override the sovereignty of the parliament.
1.2.4.2.4.3. Con: Parliament itself [passed the bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Referendum_Act_2015) in 2015 that required the Prime Minister to hold a referendum on the UK's membership to the European Union by the end of 2017. The legislature, thus, enabled the referendum and was not undermined.
1.2.4.2.5. Con: Referendums do not necessarily override parliamentary sovereignty, even if they are used to arrive at policy decisions.
1.2.4.2.5.1. Pro: The British Supreme Court [ruled](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/24/supreme-court-brexit-ruling-parliament-vote-article-50) that Parliament must approve Brexit, despite the referendum result.
1.2.4.2.5.1.1. Con: The Brexit case represents an exception as leaving the EU entails revoking the [European Communities Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Communities_Act_1972_\(UK\)), an act of parliament. The decisions of other referendums would not require parliamentary approval.
1.2.4.2.5.2. Pro: Even though a majority of Greeks rejected austerity measures in a [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_bailout_referendum,_2015) in 2015, the parliament [supported](http://www.ibtimes.com/greek-parliament-backs-bailout-was-greek-referendum-completely-pointless-2004142) their implementation a few months later.
1.2.4.2.5.2.1. Con: This extraordinary and questionable case can hardly serve as a model for referendums in general.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Referendums can lead to disorder in governments and cause perplexity as well as resignations.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: Politicians often voluntarily attach the future of their careers to the results of referendums, or are forced by public pressure to resign after losing.
1.2.4.3.1.1. Con: Politicians resign after referendums as they do not want to implement decisions they do not associate with. They do not take responsibility for these decisions thereby; after all, they were not the ones making these decisions.
1.2.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: Matteo Renzi said in the run-up to Italy's constitutional referendum of 2016 that he [would step down](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/17/matteo-renzi-repeats-vow-quit-italian-pm-loses-referendum) in case of a loss as he would not want to continue dealing with a "decrepit system that does not work".
1.2.4.3.1.1.2. Pro: The [generally assumed reason](http://www.economist.com/blogs/bagehot/2016/06/prime-minister-resigns) for why David Cameron resigned after his loss in the Brexit referendum was that he "would not have wanted to stay on and make the disaster a reality", and lost the support of his party.
1.2.4.3.1.2. Pro: Matteo Renzi made clear his intention to resign if he lost the referendum, and [indeed resigned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/matteo-renzis-future-in-the-balance-amid-high-turnout-in-italy-referendum) when he did.
1.2.4.3.1.3. Pro: David Cameron, after campaigning vigorously for the "Remain" side of the Brexit referendum and then losing, [resigned](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cameron-loses-his-big-brexit-gamble-1466740195).
1.2.4.3.2. Con: If politicians are sufficiently out of touch with the desires of the public, that they support the minority position on a very major issue, it is arguably good that they are forced out of office.
1.2.4.3.2.1. Con: By this logic, all supporters of remain during the Brexit vote should have resigned. This ignores the fact that government should be representative of the whole and not just the majority.
1.2.4.3.3. Con: If an unexpected event like a referendum result throws a government into disarray, this is likely due to deeper issues with the political situation or government, not because of the nature of referendums.
1.2.4.3.3.1. Pro: The Brexit referendum brought to light [deep disagreements](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/map-eu-europe-tory-party-conservatives-split-divided-two-a6892611.html) within the Conservative party about what Britain's place within Europe ought to be.
1.2.4.4. Pro: The results of referendums can limit the scope of action of important political actors which can hinder progress.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: In California, taxation and budgets are determined separately. This means that referendum votes lead to a [conflict in decision](http://www.economist.com/node/13649050)-making, with voters opting for increased spending but voting against the tax increases that are necessary to pay for it. This practice has contributed to multiple [budget crises](http://www.economist.com/node/18563638) over the years.
1.2.4.4.1.1. Con: A study found no evidence that voter initiatives are the reason for the California budget issues \([Matsusaka, p.8](http://www.iandrinstitute.org/docs/Matsusaka-CA-Budget-and-Initiatives-IRI.pdf)\).
1.2.4.4.1.2. Con: This is not a feature that is unique to direct democracy. Due to concerns about reelection, politicians sometimes cut taxes while increasing services, which can lead to large deficits.
1.2.4.4.1.2.1. Con: When politicians do this, they at least have to answer for the resulting budget crises. When voters do it, there is little available recourse.
1.2.5. Con: While it might appear as if referendums strengthen the voters' position and participation, in fact, referendums [only include citizens at the end](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379415000384) of a decision.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Citizens are mostly not included in the decision about whether to hold a referendum in the first place.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Referendums are [used most frequently](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402380108425432?journalCode=fwep20) in countries where they can be initiated from below. This means that citizens participate from the beginning in a significant number of referendums worldwide.
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: The Turkish constitutional referendum of 16th of April 2017 was [initiated by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2017#Background) the then-Minister of Justice and backed by then-Prime Minister Erdogan. The proposal for a referendum had to be accepted by the Turkish parliament, which it was.
1.2.5.1.3. Pro: Until now New Zealand held ten referendums, [seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendums_in_New_Zealand) of which were initiated by the government.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Citizens are not included in the decision about the wordings of referendums and which options to include.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: It has been argued that only including two options in the Brexit referendum \(Leave/Remain\) prevented it from actually representing the popular will since it forced [supporters of a soft and a hard Brexit](https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/ksjppl/2017/03/05/97/) to vote for the same option. This is a consequence of not involving voters in the decision on the options included in a referendum.
1.2.5.2.2. Con: The wording of referendum questions and the available options is usually the product of a consultative process that involves citizens' representatives, independent actors, and public debate.
1.2.5.2.2.1. Pro: The wording of the Brexit referendum and its options was revised after [concerns voiced](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/01/eu-referendum-cameron-urged-to-change-wording-of-preferred-question) by the UK's Electoral Commission, an independent body set up by parliament. Studies of the public reaction to various referendum wordings preceded the its advice \([Electoral Commission, p. 9](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/163282/EU-referendum-question-assessment-report.pdf)\).
1.2.5.2.2.2. Pro: The wording of the referendum on Scotland's independence from the UK was changed after the UK's Electoral Commission [raised concerns](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-21245701). This advice was based on research that involved public opinion, the input from experts and from political parties \([Electoral Commission, p. 4](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/153691/Referendum-on-independence-for-Scotland-our-advice-on-referendum-question.pdf)\).
1.2.5.3. Con: This is still a significant improvement over the status quo in most representative democracies where voters have no say on particular issues but merely vote for representatives.
1.2.6. Pro: In parliamentary democracies, changes to a constitution that are required to be ratified by referendum can be a useful check and balance.
1.2.6.1. Pro: If people wish there to be some type of social change, referendums are a very useful way of showing what the general population wants.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Like everything this comes with caveats, but referendums should be used to help guide legislative bodies so they more accurately understand the needs of the public.
1.2.6.1.2. Pro: Referendums would ensure enacted policies better represent the wants of the people, which is an important factor of a democratic society.
1.2.6.2. Con: That can be true in some cases, but assumes that voters understand the details of the issues at hand. In many cases, referendums are crafted by interested parties in such a way as to be [intentionally difficult to understand](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/opinion/election-night-2016/why-are-many-ballot-measures-so-confusingly-worded).
1.2.7. Con: Referendums have no accountability. Neither side is forced to enact views they argue for, nor are they judged on whether the things they promise come to pass.
1.2.8. Con: Referendums give voters the power to decide on issues, but as the implementation depends on the government, the outcome might still be unsatisfactory.
1.2.8.1. Con: Referendums are only disliked and looked down on by the side that looses. E.g Ireland approves same sex marriage first country to do so by plebiscite and its rightly celebrated. UK leaves EU, loosing side upset with the results try to discredit the process rather then address the fact the people did not support their policy position.
1.2.9. Con: The decision to hold referenda is in the hands of those who have a vested interest in the outcome. They also control timing. This creates a bias as they can frame the questions and the event to suit their desired outcome.
1.2.9.1. Pro: Referendums are commonly initiated by those with an interest in the most likely outcome.
1.2.10. Pro: When elected representatives run for office, they run on a variety of issues. Many votes don't agree on every issues with the candidate that they vote for and have to choose their highest priorities. This means that there is a fairly high likelihood that the consensus of the current representatives on a particular issue doesn't reflect the consensus of the public on that issue. Referendums are a way of overriding that.
1.2.11. Con: Strengthening voters through referendums undermines the accountability of political representatives, another foundation of democracy: As the policy decision is made by voters, referendums free politicians from being held accountable for the decision and its consequences.
1.2.11.1. Con: As governments are often responsible for the initiation and implementation of referendums, they are indirectly accountable for their outcomes and the resulting consequences.
1.2.11.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.3.1.
1.2.11.2. Pro: Governments can organize referendums to avoid shouldering the accountability for difficult, potentially unpopular decisions \([Setälä, p. 700](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00630.x/full)\).
1.2.11.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.11.1.
1.2.11.2.2. Pro: It [has](http://theconversation.com/a-plebiscite-on-same-sex-marriage-would-be-a-failure-of-parliaments-responsibility-55289) [been](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-21/steketee-governments-have-to-govern/6715386) [argued](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/why-parliament-should-decide-on-same-sex-marriage) that the proposed referendum on gay marriage in Australia was an attempt by Parliament to avoid the responsibility of a parliamentary vote on the issue.
1.2.11.2.3. Con: It [has been argued](https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2016/06/29/richard-ekins-the-legitimacy-of-the-brexit-referendum/) that it can be appropriate for the government to delegate responsibility in some cases. Certain decisions warrant asking the people as a whole, especially if the outcomes are potentially irreversible and have large-scale consequences, as was the case for the Brexit referendum.
1.3. Pro: Referendums can lead to a [tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority).
1.3.1. Con: Just because the tyranny of the majority is a possible outcome makes it neither likely nor inevitable. This warning therefore represents a [slippery slope fallacy](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/slippery-slope.html): just because a bad outcome can happen does not mean that it will happen.
1.3.1.1. Con: It does not necessarily mean that it will not either. The fact that the potential of a slippery slope exists should be warning enough, in the presence of better mechanisms that do not carry that risk.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Majority rule does not necessarily turn into a tyranny of the majority; democracies have safeguards that help prevent this.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: The rights and freedoms of minorities are usually protected by the constitution, laws and courts that can be appealed to.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: The US Supreme Court has been described as "[counter-majoritarian](http://lsolum.typepad.com/legaltheory/2012/09/legal-theory-lexicon-the-counter-majoritarian-difficulty.html)" due to its ability to permanently overrule decisions made by the majority of democratically elected lawmakers in Congress.
1.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: Since the adoption of the [Charter of Rights and Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms) in 1982, Canada has been described as a system in which constitutional supremacy reigns over parliamentary supremacy, and where this paramount law trumps even a democratic majority \([Supreme Court, par. 72](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1998/1998canlii793/1998canlii793.html)\).
1.3.1.2.1.3. Con: If the constitution itself is subject of a referendum the majority can change it according to its conception.
1.3.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Many constitutions contain so-called [eternity clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternity_clause) that rule out the amendment of elements of the constitution, such as provisions about the nature of the state and the protection of human rights. Examples for countries with eternity clauses are Germany, the Czech Republic, Greece and Italy.
1.3.1.2.1.3.2. Con: Most entrenched constitutions cannot be amended through a simple majority referendum. For example, the US Constitution [requires three quarters of states to vote for any amendment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution) Non-entrenched constitutions can be amended more easily, but are also less powerful in the first place.
1.3.1.2.1.3.3. Pro: In [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_minaret_referendum,_2009) 57.5% of the participating voters decided to create a constitutional amendment in order to prohibit the constructions of minarets. This is a limitation of a minority's freedom of religion.
1.3.1.2.1.3.3.1. Con: Those who perceive themselves as victims of the decision are free to challenge it in court, for example at the European Court of Human Rights \(where only non-victims challenged the ban so far, which the court [dismissed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_minaret_referendum,_2009#Aftermath_of_the_referendum_and_implementation_of_the_ban)\).
1.3.1.2.1.3.3.1.1. Con: The individuals who appealed were "non-victims" in the sense that they did not literally intend to build a minaret at that time. They were still affected in that the law was a signal of hostility towards their rights and their religious group. Given that the court dismissed the case, perhaps it is not sufficiently well-placed to protect minorities against these sorts of laws.
1.3.1.2.1.4. Con: Many countries \(eg [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom), [New Zealand](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11693717), [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Laws_of_Israel)\) have non-[supreme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause) constitutions, meaning that they have no substantial legal force and are therefore unable to effectively protect minority rights.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: Except in the UK those safeguards are intentionally watered down, because referendums are supposed to be treated as advisory.
1.3.1.2.3. Pro: Minority rights are protected. For example, if a southern state  in the US held a referendum to bring back slavery, it wouldn't matter if 99% of voters say yes because an outcome like that wouldn't stand.
1.3.1.2.3.1. Con: That might be true in that specific case, but that doesn't hold up well to those facing the prospect of seeing their families split by Brexit or UK citizens losing EU citizenship.
1.3.2. Con: Referendums can equally lead to a tyranny of the minority when relatively small segments of society wield disproportionate influence over politics.
1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.4.
1.3.3. Pro: The uncompromising character of referendums favors the majority to the disadvantage of minorities.
1.3.3.1. Pro: In the Brexit referendum of 2016, the people of Scotland and Northern Ireland [voted in favour of](http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results) remaining in the EU. That they were outvoted made parts of the two countries' populations angry and led to [calls](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/how-would-brexit-affect-northern-ireland-and-scotland/) to leave the UK.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: This is just a by-product of being part of the United Kingdom and not a referendum-specific problem. Neither Scotland nor Northern Ireland voted for the current Conservative government either.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Representatives of minorities are able to influence political decisions during the legislative process, negotiate and object their concerns. Referendums omit this option.
1.3.3.3. Con: Referenda do not need to be uncompromising. Multiple options could be placed on a ballot, or a past decision mediated by a subsequent proposal.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.1.
1.3.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.3.3.4. Con: If a person with many unpopular opinions can be elected by a minority, and thereby gain vast influence and power — as happened with [Trump in 2016](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-polarization-analysis/trump-won-with-lowest-minority-vote-in-decades-fueling-divisions-idUSKBN13I10B) — then referendums stand out as a crucial tool for deciding policy that meets the criteria of majority rule.
1.3.3.5. Pro: The democratic argument cannot be stated as “the people should decide in every major political issue of the community”. That mechanism ultimately tends to harm minorities' position, because if minorities have to contend in terms of sheer numbers, of course they will lose every political battle. If it was up majorities and consensus, eg LGBTQ rights would never come to happen.
1.3.3.5.1. Con: In Ireland [same-sex marriage](https://www.theguardian.com/global/live/2015/may/23/counting-underway-for-irelands-referendum-on-marriage-equality) got legalized by popular vote in 2015. This clearly shows that the majority can foster minorities' rights.
1.3.3.5.1.1. Pro: This is despite the fact that Ireland is [one of the most religious Western democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland#Demographics), illustrating the extent to which minority rights can still be successfully defended through referendums, despite a seemingly hostile environment.
1.3.3.5.1.2. Con: Many Irish LGBT people and their families found the Irish Marriage Equality referendum [especially tough](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/irish-gay-marriage-referendum-campaigner-warns-malcolm-turnbull-and-mps-against-plebiscite-20160823-gqz0o8.html), even though it passed, because they effectively had to beg the country for their human rights. It would have been more appropriate to have dealt with the issue through parliamentary legislation.
1.3.3.5.1.2.1. Con: There's no guarantee that parliament would represent the interests of minorities any better than Ireland's citizenry could.  MPs could have easily dismissed their concerns, or worse, they could have shunned them over reelection fears.
1.3.4. Pro: Especially in large countries, any vote being based purely on approval of the majority is dangerous, given it could sway votes in favor of populations that are cluttered in small areas. Therefore, it acts mostly in favor of a segment of the population usually not in touch with the rest.
1.3.5. Con: Allowing referendums and risking the dominance of a majority is a lesser problem than abolishing referendums and silencing the majority.
1.3.5.1. Con: Reducing or abolishing referendums does not silence the majority.  They still vote to determine who their elected officials are, can still lobby their elected officials, etc.
1.3.6. Pro: In diverse communities people may vote on referendums that don't directly affect their lives but do affect the autonomy and justice experienced by others. All whilst looking like democracy has been enhanced with an extra voting exercise.
1.3.7. Con: -> See 1.3.3.5.1.
1.3.8. Con: If a referendum only has a small regional application, it will be more targeted and less prone to a "tyranny of the majority".
1.3.9. Con: Any democracy can lead to a tyranny of the majority - if people wanted to they could vote into power a political party that would oppress minorities without a referendum.
1.3.9.1. Pro: And unlike a political party, referendums usually only represent a narrow range of policy, greatly reducing the potential damage of tyranny by the majority.
1.3.9.2. Con: However, consensus-building elements of electoral processes in democracies would make this very difficult.
1.3.9.2.1. Pro: The necessity of forming coalition governments with smaller parties would have a moderating influence on any extremist tendencies of the main governing party.
1.3.9.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.2.2.1.
1.3.9.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.2.1.3.
1.3.9.2.1.3. Pro: Small parties would be unwilling to associate with parties that oppress minorities, for fear of tainting their longterm brand.
1.3.10. Pro: Referendums ignore minority rights in favour of populist sentiment.
1.3.10.1. Con: Populist sentiment can get even worse if the perception is that it hasn't gotten a hearing and that politicians are ignoring the people. Brexit occurred after decades of EU expansion which people had no say on, and arguably the lack of referendums in these situations made the populist anti-establishment movement all the more potent.
1.3.10.1.1. Pro: The resulting populist anger can also end up empowering populist political parties; so not only does the bad policy end up getting passed, but governments shift position on other policies as well to accommodate the growing strength of populist policies.
1.3.10.1.1.1. Pro: The past few years have seen the rise of various political forces that rail against tone-deaf elites who govern without consideration of the population at large. Among them are the [Alternative for Germany](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/success-of-afd-populists-akin-to-revolt-against-merkel-a-1083147.html), [Donald Trump](http://www.npr.org/2017/04/26/525551816/trumps-efforts-to-drain-the-swamp-lagging-behind-his-campaign-rhetoric) with his promise to "drain the swamp" and [Marine Le Pen](http://time.com/4755192/france-le-pen-election-2017/) in France.
1.3.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.1.3.3.
1.4. Pro: Referendums are inefficient and time-intensive.
1.4.1. Pro: According to the economic principle of division of labor, it is substantially more efficient when some specialists do politics instead of a mass of laymen \([Matsusaka, p. 2](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~matsusak/Papers/Matsusaka_DD_PC_Encyclopedia.pdf)\).
1.4.1.1. Con: At the same time, the specialization of a political class further detaches those who are supposed to be represented by politicians.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: In the United States, less than 20% of voters approve of the work Congress does, half believe that most of its members are corrupt, 70% that they serve special interests and 80% that they are out of touch \([Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx)\).
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: In Germany, half of all voters believe that politicians are out of touch, three out of four have little or no trust in political parties, and 40% are not satisfied with how democracy works in Germany \([infratest dimap, p. 12-14](http://www.infratest-dimap.de/fileadmin/user_upload/dt1610_bericht.pdf)\).
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: As of 2010, [more](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2453/Satisfaction-with-the-way-Parliament-works-19952010.aspx) British voters were dissatisfied than were satisfied with how their parliament works; and as of 2009, [83%](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2443/MPs-Motives-19942009.aspx) of them believed that their representative served first their own interests or those of their party; rather than those of their constituents or the country as a whole.
1.4.1.1.4. Pro: There is a disconnect between the political positions of voters and their elected representatives. For instance, the political polarization of representatives in the US is not reflected in their electorate \([Fiorina/Levendusky, p. 71](https://sites.sas.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/mleven/files/fl_brookings_volume.pdf)\).
1.4.1.2. Con: The harmful logical extension of this claim about specialization is an abolishment of democracy and the introduction of a technocracy.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Democracy is a superior system in part because of the recognition that the correct public policies are difficult to empirically discern and the aggregation of as many opinions as possible can be a better heuristic than reliance on the opinion of a few technocrats.
1.4.1.3. Con: The occasional referendum can coexist with parliamentary democracy and so does not preclude a division of labour. Even in Switzerland, the country which utilises referendums the most, most governance and politics are carried out by specialists.
1.4.2. Pro: Referendums about [international treaties](http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21699146-direct-democracy-spreading-across-europe-not-always-good-thing-referendumania) would strongly complicate the related negotiation process and make it increasingly hard to agree on transnational policies.
1.4.2.1. Pro: [Minorities of voters](http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21699146-direct-democracy-spreading-across-europe-not-always-good-thing-referendumania) in smaller countries may be able to stymie Europe-wide policies, especially when the turnout is rather low.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: This is due to the peculiarities of the necessary approval processes for EU treaties. This blocking of European policies could equally have happened if it was an elected government that refused to assent to the policy.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Governments may be more in touch with EU politics and may therefore be held accountable for obstinate actions which obstruct the progress of continent-wide agreements. Voters are far less in touch with these considerations.
1.4.2.2. Con: Allowing diplomats to negotiate international treaties without direct popular scrutiny can lead to businesses having [disproportionate lobbying power](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-tpp-lobbying-idUSKCN0PX2JO20150723) and the creation of [intensely](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/12/obama-trade-deals-congress-trans-pacific-partnership) [unpopular](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11635635) [clauses](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kill-the-dispute-settlement-language-in-the-trans-pacific-partnership/2015/02/25/ec7705a2-bd1e-11e4-b274-e5209a3bc9a9_story.html?utm_term=.cc4ed90579c6).
1.4.2.3. Pro: Requiring international peace treaties \(and domestic peace treaties also\) to go to popular vote would be especially difficult, and would entail the added risk of jeopardising peace should the referendum fail.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: This is not necessarily true. When the initial peace deal between Colombia and FARC was rejected in a referendum, the two parties managed to reach a new agreement [quite soon after](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/01/colombias-government-formally-ratifies-revised-farc-peace-deal) the failed referendum.
1.4.2.4. Con: Arguably, some international treaties need popular legitimacy. Part of the reason the [Good Friday agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement) has been so strong and enduring is the overwhelming popular support it received in referendums. This made it much more difficult for dissidents to undermine it since they could not claim they were representing a majority in any community.
1.4.2.5. Con: The fact that making some policy decisions through referendums causes inconvenience is not proof that referendums shouldn't exist at all.
1.4.3. Pro: Referendums often negate the chance at compromise that is supposed to occur within the elected body. They also depend upon the electorate being motivated to research and understand.  The ability for the electorate to understand the immediate and strategic consequences of referendums is questionable.
1.4.4. Con: Referendums provide a way to settle contentious issues when elected officials are unable to make a decision.
1.4.4.1. Pro: The best way to decide whether or not to abolish referendums would be through a referendum, as any restriction of power should be decided by an equal or higher forum \(in our case, the highest, the electorate\). Which proves the necessity of at least one type of referendum.
1.4.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.4.4.3. Pro: If the issue was not a part of the ruling party's initial platform, they may not have any clear mandate either way and are therefore unable to decide.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: Modern democracies are usually not based on [imperative mandates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mandate) that allow representatives to do only what was explicitly approved in elections. Instead, they have a degree of freedom in representing the people.
1.4.4.3.1.1. Con: Although formalised imperative mandates do not exist anymore, politicians cannot simply do what they want. Political mandates in modern democracies are more informal: politicians derive authority from properly representing the wishes of their voters. When they veer too far beyond these wishes, their actions might be perceived as illegitimate and they risk political ramifications.
1.4.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: In 2010, the British Liberal Democrats ran on a platform of opposing tuition fees and were supported by many students. Between 2010 and 2015, they were part of a coalition government that significantly raised tuition fees, thus doing the exact opposite of the political mandate they had received from their electorate. In the 2015 election, [students voters punished](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/general-election-2015-students-being-put-off-voting-for-lib-dems-over-tuition-fees-u-turn-10188327.html) the Liberal Democrats by not voting for them anymore.
1.4.4.3.2. Pro: Referendums occur when politicians are uncertain about who their supporters are and what they think. It is a way of resolving a problem that [may be a major vote loser](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/political-science/2016/oct/06/why-referendums-are-problematic-yet-more-popular-than-ever) in an election.
1.4.4.3.3. Pro: [Referendums arose after](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/political-science/2016/oct/06/why-referendums-are-problematic-yet-more-popular-than-ever) the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the Second World War, and the fall of communism. Times of crisis create uncertainty and make it more difficult for politicians to gain or excise a mandate.
1.4.4.4. Pro: Entrenched partisanship may mean there is no clear consensus for or against a particular issue. A referendum can clear this up.
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: Often, partisanship among elected officials is not reflective of similar circumstances among the general population: for example, there is [broad bipartisan](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/10/05/is-the-gun-lobby-still-invincible/bipartisan-support-on-gun-restrictions-partisan-divide-on-legislation) support among American voters, but not elected officials, for background checks on gun purchases.
1.4.4.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.
1.4.5. Pro: Referendums mean that politicians have to campaign once more and are taken away from performing their day to day work.
1.4.5.1. Con: It is beneficial that politicians are occasionally forced to publicly justify their side of a significant issue to voters, rather than working in relative obscurity within government.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: Citizens have easy and direct contact to their government officials due to increased access via online platforms and during regular open consultation-hours in their offices and thus can easily confront them.
1.4.5.1.1.1. Con: While this may be the case in theory, public opinion points in a different direction. In countries like the US and Germany, about half or more of citizens consider their representatives as out of touch \([Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx), [infratest dimap, p. 12](http://www.infratest-dimap.de/fileadmin/user_upload/dt1610_bericht.pdf)\).
1.4.5.1.1.2. Pro: Voters have been [increasingly making use](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/03/politics/congress-phone-calls/) of these avenues of contacting politicians.
1.4.5.1.1.3. Con: In a lot of places, [a majority of voters](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-22555659) are unable to name their local representative, let alone have access to them. Regardless of potential access, most politicians do still work in obscurity.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Referendums effectively stall governments by ensuring that all their political capital is used on one issue.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: The civil service and politicians not directly involved in the campaign still carry out all the normal functions of government.
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: This is because other policies will often be impacted by the change proposed by the referendum. Consequently, there is an incentive for politicians to stall ongoing political legislative processes until it is clear how the referendum decision will be implemented.
1.4.5.2.2.1. Con: If the decision is made by politicians, presumably it will still take time to negotiate and reach a position, so most of the same costs will be incurred.
1.4.5.2.2.1.1. Con: The outcomes of parliamentary votes are usually predictable; the results of referendums are far harder to predict and thus give more incentives to "wait and see".
1.4.5.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Almost all [conventional polls](https://qz.com/717016/one-form-of-polling-was-dead-accurate-on-brexit-and-its-changing-how-we-predict-elections/) were wrong about the Brexit referendum's outcome.
1.4.6. Pro: Referendums interrupt the way representative democracies are meant to function.
1.4.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.
1.4.7. Con: In combination with the benefits of [E-democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-democracy) the costs can be decreased and the efficiency increased.
1.4.7.1. Con: The primary costs accrue from lengthy campaign processes, not the literal collection of votes.
1.4.7.2. Pro: The convenience of voting online also has the potential to increase voter turnout. After the referendum on Scottish independence in 2014, more than half of those who did not vote said that the option to vote online would have made it more likely for them to vote \([Electoral Commission, p. 18](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/179807/Scottish-referendum-Public-Opinion-survey-ICM-Report-WEBSITE.pdf)\).
1.4.7.3. Con: Electronic voting is still in its infancy, and liable to fraud and technical [problems](https://www.eff.org/issues/e-voting).
1.4.7.3.1. Pro: With an eye on the threat posed by outside interference, the Netherlands [reverted back](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/02/02/amid-hacking-and-false-news-fears-dutch-hand-count-vote/97387582/) to paper ballots and vote counting by hand for the recent general election.
1.4.7.3.2. Con: These are engineering problems which can be solved. They are not grounds to reject the idea, only perhaps to delay it.
1.4.7.3.3. Con: "Instant communication" does not necessarily mean electronic voting, but rather easy communication between representatives and their constituents, perhaps through social media or phone communication.
1.4.7.3.3.1. Pro: Establishing effective communication between the government and the governed is about a million miles away from the idea of referendums. 
It is exactly what we should be moving towards.
1.4.7.3.3.2. Con: The main obstacle to a true plebiscite on every political issue is the need for every citizen to physically go to a polling station and fill out a paper-ballot. As long as the voting process remains paper-based, technological change will not make plebiscites more practical.
1.4.7.3.4. Pro: The German hacker collective CCC argues that electronic voting is [inherently less secure](https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2006/ptb-bestaetigt-nichteignung) and more liable to fraud than paper ballot based voting, since it eliminates the possibility of verifying results by recounting the physical ballots. This would mean that a transition to electronic voting will never be possible.
1.4.8. Pro: Instead of resolving political problems, referendums often prolong the existing arguments or even create new ones, especially when one side wins by a slim majority and the other side demands a recount or new referendum.
1.4.8.1. Con: The creation of new topical political issues is not necessarily a bad thing - perhaps it just means the public is more thoroughly probing all the important issues in society.
1.4.8.2. Pro: Ireland had to hold repeat referendums on both the [Nice](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/18/eu.politics1) and [Lisbon](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/5579684/Ireland-to-hold-second-referendum-on-Lisbon-Treaty.html) EU treaties because in both cases the first referendum did not successfully resolve the matter.
1.4.8.3. Pro: The 2016 referendum on the UK's membership in the EU by no means put a decisive end to the debate about this issue. In the referendum, a [small majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016) voted to leave the EU. By now, polls indicate that almost six out of ten British citizens think that this was a mistake \([YouGov, p. 3](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/rnz6ummmks/TimesResults_170518_Scotland_WestminsterVI_W.pdf)\).
1.4.8.4. Con: It is unclear whether this is because of a referendum or the fact that it is a controversial policy. If these decisions were instead made by politicians, it is likely that the same calls would exist given the number of people unhappy with the decision.
1.4.8.4.1. Pro: If policies pass by very slim parliamentary majorities, similar challenges can be made to their legitimacy. For example, the AHCA passed by an [incredibly slim](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/watch-democrats-break-out-song-ahca-passes-obamacare-republicans-vote-aca-healthcare-2017-5?r=US&IR=T) majority and its legitimacy has been [angrily questioned](https://mic.com/articles/176705/the-gop-rep-who-ensured-the-ahca-would-pass-faced-angry-constituents-at-a-town-hall#.mnpKiKqjx).
1.4.8.4.2. Pro: If the decision was instead made by politicians, the resulting disagreement could be even more bitter, as those opposed to the policy feel that the democratic process has not sufficiently represented them.
1.4.9. Pro: Referendums create additional steps in the legal procedure of the political system.
1.4.9.1. Con: Normal legislation also follows lengthy approval processes. Referendums mean we can dispense with many of the normal features of the legislative process.
1.4.9.1.1. Pro: In New Zealand, the lengthy [select commitee](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/) is designed to ensure public input on any proposed law. Legislation passed by referendum would not require this, since a referendum is the ultimate form of public input.
1.4.9.2. Pro: In case of ["Brexit"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016#Legislation), the referendum draft had to pass both houses of parliament with several readings before the months lasting campaigning could begin. After the result, both houses of parliament had to vote again on the actual implementation of the referendum's proposal.
1.4.10. Con: In political decision-making, efficiency and speed are less important than the quality of policies produced. Otherwise, not only referendums, but also elections and democracy as a whole would have to be called into question.
1.4.10.1. Con: Even if efficiency and speed are secondary in theory, sometimes it is required that politics is able to react fast to unexpected or urgent events without protracted procedures.
1.4.10.1.1. Con: There is no reason why a system which includes the option of referendums should not be able to react to unexpected events. They would still retain the option to resolve the problem quickly through government if that was deemed to be necessary.
1.4.10.2. Con: Efficiency and speed are vitally important, regardless of the policy - if it is implemented more quickly, it can begin providing benefits earlier, and therefore have a greater overall impact.
1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.3.
1.6. Con: -> See 1.4.4.
1.7. Con: Referendums for policy decisions should be an option, but their use should be constrained, with high thresholds to get on the ballot and constraints on the types of policies they can control.
1.8. Con: The people, as the sovereign, must have the right to directly influence political decisions.
1.8.1. Pro: Political philosophers have advocated referendums as necessary for democracy to work.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Sun Yat Sen [advocated](http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/ps/cup/sun_yatsen_democracy.pdf) his "Four Powers of the People" which were supposed to give them not only power over the government via elections, but also over legislative processes via the power to initiate and conduct referendums. Only in this way can direct control of the people over the governance of the society be ensured.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Jean-Jacques Rousseau took the [radical position](http://www.constitution.org/jjr/socon_03.htm#015) that the people's general will cannot be represented, for example because election results usually ignore the losing side. His conclusion: "Every law the people has not ratified in person is null and void — is, in fact, not a law."
1.8.1.2.1. Con: Referendums similarly ignore the opinions of those who voted for the losing option, so it is not clear why they are an improvement in terms of democratic legitimacy. If anything, elections are superior in that regard, since an opposition party that loses narrowly still possesses a great deal of political power.
1.8.1.2.2. Con: Rousseau's position is extremely radical - he claims the basic concept of a "representative" is incomprehensible, and that governance can only happen through referendums. This is a suggestion that is clearly impractical given the number of decisions modern states make every day, so we should reject Rousseau's principles.
1.8.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.
1.8.1.4. Con: Even [Amartya Sen](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/22/amartya-sen-brexit-trump-press-freedom), a philosopher and great champion of public reasoning and democracy, does not believe that referendums necessarily represent the public will effectively.
1.8.2. Pro: The introduction of referendums makes a political system more intrinsically democratic: instead of having one or few policy makers, everyone can partake in political decision-making.
1.8.3. Con: Although people have the fundamental [inalienable right](http://www.unfpa.org/resources/human-rights-principles) to participate in the political decision-making process, this does not necessarily need to happen through referendums. While the former right is inalienable, the latter can be forfeited.
1.8.3.1. Con: This would only be legitimate, in the context of a democratic political system, if the forfeiture was a rational and informed choice made by the population.
1.8.3.1.1. Con: Democracies are historically grown political systems and it is accepted that voters decades ago could make procedural decisions for their descendants, regardless of whether that decision was rational and informed.
1.8.3.1.2. Con: It is impossible to determine whether a popular decision was informed and rational – that is why democracies use majority decisions as proxies. To ensure that momentous decisions like the forfeiture of rights are not made lightly, they require a higher threshold.
1.8.3.1.2.1. Pro: Constitutional amendments, which often change political rights or how they are exercised, require a much higher threshold than other policy decisions, such as overwhelming majorities in two of the following three: [all houses of parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendments_under_the_French_Fifth_Republic), [federal states](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution), [a referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_96_of_the_Japanese_Constitution).
1.8.3.1.3. Con: It is impossible to determine whether the decision of the population to vote in favor of a forfeiture of rights was rational since rationality is always subjective and cannot be defined objectively.
1.8.3.1.3.1. Pro: Voter decisions may often seem ignorant to outside observers due to a lack of information, while actually being perfectly rational from the voters' own perspective.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: Voters' interests cannot be determined objectively because they depend on what voters actually value, not what analysts or politicians think they should value.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: In many cases, there is no obvious right or wrong in political decision making.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Decisions based on values that are society-oriented with the greater good in mind are better for society than decisions based on individual interests.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Democracy requires voters to decide according to their interest. If they value their personal interest over the societal interest, there is nothing wrong with that.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Society's interests are just the sum of individual interests. What determines the greater good is itself determined by the collection of individual's values.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Many referendums are on fundamental issues such as secession or [peace and justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombian_peace_agreement_referendum,_2016), which turn more on moral judgements than practical ones. In these cases, the moral priorities of voters principally ought to be what guides political decision-making.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: Many decisions are based on values - where politicians are unlikely to have an advantage over the average citizen. Conservatives and liberals put different emphasis on particular moral considerations in their world views \([Graham et al., p. 1029](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jessegra/papers/GrahamHaidtNosek.2009.Moral%20foundations%20of%20liberals%20and%20conservatives.JPSP.pdf)\).
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: It has been argued that everyone cares about equality as a value, yet it has different meanings to different people.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Amartya Sen [argues](http://www.ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Sen-1979_Equality-of-What.pdf) that liberals interpret equality in terms of equality of well-being, resources, or capability, whilst conservatives interpret it in terms of equality of liberty.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Left-leaning voters tend to understand fairness in terms of equality; right-leaning voters in terms of proportionality \([Haidt, p. 138](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ItuzJhbcpMIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Righteous+Mind:+Why+Good+People+Are+Divided+by+Politics+and+Religion&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwidu7meu47SAhVFi7wKHQ1rAkIQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.1.4. Pro: The consequences of many decisions are next to impossible to predict. The outcome of a Brexit, for example, is dependent on countless decisions inside and outside the UK that could not be known prior to the referendum.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Even if certain outcomes of a choice are unpredictable, it is still possible to make a prediction about whether the consequences of that decision are on aggregate more likely to be good than bad.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.1.5. Con: The question is not whether the citizens are making the 'right' decision, as there would be no referendum if one choice was obviously correct. Instead, the concern is that citizens vote without understanding the outcome of their choices.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Referendums frequently occur over policies that are either deeply flawed, questionably constitutional or obviously beneficial. There is no functional barrier to this in most countries, and so no reason to believe that this would change.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.2. Con: When voters profess to value certain goals, and then vote in ways which clearly undermine those goals, it can be assumed that they're acting irrationally.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: For example, many voters oppose free trade or immigration with the professed aim of protecting domestic workers. Yet [in reality](http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf), trade and immigration help domestic workers by raising the number of available jobs and making products cheaper.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.3. Con: There are some broad concerns shared by voters in most countries, even if the importance afforded to them varies from election to election. Security and economics are two such widely shared concerns.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: For example, German voters in 2013 care about [wages and pensions](https://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2013-09-22-BT-DE/umfrage-wahlentscheidend.shtml), French voters in 2017 cared about [security, identity and unemployment](http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/10/15/election-presidentielle-securite-identite-et-chomage-les-grands-themes-en-vogue-2536352-6121.php) and US voters in 2016 cared about the [economy, terrorism and foreign policy](http://www.people-press.org/2016/07/07/4-top-voting-issues-in-2016-election/). Economics were and issue of concern in all three elections.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.4. Pro: The Brexit vote was widely [considered](http://uk.businessinsider.com/thaler-brexit-shows-irrational-behavior-2016-6?r=US&IR=T) [irrational](http://www.vox.com/2016/6/25/12029786/brexit-uk-eu-immigration-xenophobia) because analysts assumed that a weaker economy was objectively bad. However, many voters voted according to issues other than the economy such as [their British identity](https://www.ft.com/content/b6da366a-39ca-11e6-a780-b48ed7b6126f) or [who makes their laws](http://www.comresglobal.com/polls/sunday-mirror-post-referendum-poll/).
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.4.1. Con: Large parts of the [British public](https://www.rt.com/uk/346342-brexit-voters-ignorance-misinformation/) had a misguided perception of the EU, mainly due to ignorance and misinformation, and thus voted for leave.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Interested and informed voters could have easily found out that the populists' [numbers](https://www.rt.com/uk/346342-brexit-voters-ignorance-misinformation/) and "facts" about the EU are wrong.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: If more than the majority of citizens did not take use of such a possibility, it seems that this option was not so obvious and easy after all.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.4.2. Con: National identity and sentiment are essentially irrational as they are based on emotions.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: [Strong emotions](http://justgotdiagnosed.com/resources/emotions-leading-you-around-by-the-nose/) connected to national sentiment like fear and anger can cloud the ability to think clearly and lead to emotional-fueled decisions that can be opposed to the individuals' self-interests.
1.8.3.1.3.1.1.4.2.2. Con: Psychological research indicates that rationality and emotions are not opposites. In fact, rationality depends on emotions as many of our preferences - upon which we can act rational - are based on emotions \([McDermott, p. 699f.](http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/McDermott/papers/rationality2004.pdf)\).
1.8.3.1.3.1.2. Pro: Voters and legislators alike take the path dependency of their decisions into account: Even if a policy that is in their interest is enacted today, it may [limit their choices in the long run](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/epenn/files/A_Model_of_Farsighted_Voting.pdf). In some cases, they may decide that they prefer keeping their options open, and their decisions may appear irrational in the short term despite being rational in the long term.
1.8.3.1.3.1.2.1. Con: The average citizen is not capable of predicting the complex social, political and economical long-term consequences of their vote and voting accordingly.
1.8.3.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: When many US states banned gay marriage after the 2004 presidential elections, many gay rights groups [refrained from challenging these laws](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/epenn/files/A_Model_of_Farsighted_Voting.pdf) in court. While it may have been in their interest to have discriminatory laws repealed, courts upholding them would establish a legal precedent and entrench them even further.
1.8.3.1.3.1.3. Pro: Assuming that voters' interests are economic, they are better placed than anyone else to decide what will improve their economic situation.
1.8.3.1.3.1.3.1. Con: Most people lack basic [financial skills](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/05/the-danger-of-financial-ignorance-do-you-understand-money/361851/) and understanding.
1.8.3.1.3.1.3.2. Pro: Most people and [many politicians](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-agency-payday-lenders_us_57502482e4b0eb20fa0ccd7f) assume that it is always irrational to take out payday loans \(short-term, high-interest loans\). However, low-income individuals [often use them](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/payday-loans/) to overcome short-term unexpected financial shocks.
1.8.3.1.3.1.3.2.1. Con: It is questionable whether taking out payday loans illustrates economic prowess. Payday loans oftentimes lead into [cycles of debt](http://www.npr.org/2015/03/26/395421117/payday-loans-and-endless-cycles-of-debt-targeted-by-federal-watchdog). Google even refuses advertisement for them, [classifying them](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/11/google-ban-payday-loan-ad) as dangerous products in line with weapons, tobacco and explosives.
1.8.3.1.3.1.3.3. Pro: Many discussions of a [universal basic income](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/6/14007230/kenya-basic-income-givedirectly-experiment-village) argue that unconditional cash payments to poor people are the best way of improving their welfare and that they know better than anyone else which investments make sense for them.
1.8.3.1.3.1.3.4. Con: A major survey that asked Americans various questions on economics and finance issues assigned the average adult a grade of C; almost a third received an F \([Harris, p. 11f.](http://www.councilforeconed.org/cel/WhatAmericansKnowAboutEconomics_042605-3.pdf)\).
1.8.3.1.3.1.3.5. Pro: While the government may think that recipients of welfare should spend a certain amount of money on food, recipients may decide that it is worth skipping a few meals to buy status symbols \(e.g. clothes\) that [signal respectability](http://tressiemc.com/2013/10/29/the-logic-of-stupid-poor-people/) and yield long-term benefits, such as increasing job opportunities.
1.8.3.1.3.1.3.5.1. Con: However, some governments recognise that people do not always make good choices and make their own external decisions regardless of the desired choices of the affected citizens.
1.8.3.1.3.1.3.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.1.3.1.3.1.
1.8.3.1.3.1.3.5.1.2. Pro: For example, the government sometimes uses targeted aid through the [SNAP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program) program.
1.8.3.1.3.1.3.5.2. Pro: There is [a](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/welfare-reform-direct-cash-poor/407236/) [wealth](https://www.princeton.edu/~joha/publications/Haushofer_Shapiro_UCT_2016.04.25.pdf) [of](http://www.economist.com/news/international/21588385-giving-money-directly-poor-people-works-surprisingly-well-it-cannot-deal) [evidence](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2013/10/25/240590433/what-happens-when-you-just-give-money-to-poor-people) that simply giving poor citizens money is much more efficient for improving their economic situation than transfers tied to a government-determined purposes.
1.8.3.1.3.2. Con: Rationality can uncontroversially be objectively defined as \(at a bare minimum\) choosing the course of action that will best fulfill one's desires. Insofar as voters' choices are clearly contrary to their own desires, it can objectively be said that they are acting irrationally.
1.8.3.1.3.2.1. Con: Political decisions usually involve conflicting desires, and it is impossible to determine externally which desire is the strongest.
1.8.3.1.4. Con: A democratically reached decision does not have to be rational to be legitimate.
1.8.3.1.4.1. Con: If voters succumb to irrationality and do not vote in accordance with their interests and desires, the purpose of democracy - to accurately represent the wishes of voters - is ruined and the decision is therefore not legitimate.
1.8.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: Democracy is most frequently [justified](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democracy/#Ins) on the basis that it tends to produce policies which best serve the interests of voters.
1.8.3.1.4.1.2. Con: This presumes that individuals do know how their interests are best served, which is often not the case.
1.8.3.1.5. Con: The idea of humans as rational actors is "psychologically unrealistic", hence there is little point in making rational behavior a requirement for democratic participation \([Kahneman, p. 1470](https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/Publications/Maps_bounded_rationality_DK_2003.pdf)\).
1.8.3.1.5.1. Pro: As the concept of humans as rational actors depends on assumptions such as unrestricted cognition and thinking, the alternative concept of bounded rationality was introduced to situate human reasoning within the cognitive and psychological limits of the human mind \([Selten, p. 13, 16](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=dVMq5UoYS3YC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=bounded+rationality+unrealistic&source=bl&ots=p-8o_LKK_W&sig=plnzNGL2V9gr85q_Ed0RAB3z6zw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjfib_gz4nUAhWIoJQKHYECCHYQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=bounded%20rationality%20unrealistic&f=false)\).
1.8.3.1.5.2. Pro: The rejection of the belief in human rationality has been widely accepted in fields like Economics. [Behavioral economics](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/BehavioralEconomics.html#abouttheauthor), which takes into account the work of cognitive and social psychology, has been established as an alternative to the traditional, rationally-focused approach.
1.8.3.1.6. Pro: Public animosity towards referendums is likely an expression of a temporary period of irrational anger or apathy that is shaped by the recent political context, rather than a reasoned rejection of the right to a referendum.
1.8.3.1.6.1. Con: The results of democratic elections cannot be invalidated because they're supposedly based on "temporary irrationality." If citizens want to reject democracy or their political rights, we should respect their decision.
1.8.3.2. Pro: [Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternity_clause) and basic principles of equality are considered inalienable in most democratic states. However, rights associated with how democracy is implemented such as the right to hold referendums can be changed or forfeited if there is enough popular support.
1.8.4. Con: A democratically electoral system where the individual votes for a political party and where anyone can start a political party or become a political reprehensive already gives freedom of choice to the people negating the need for referendums.
1.8.5. Con: It is a legitimate and widely-established practice for voters to voluntarily delegate some of their decision-making power to representatives.
1.8.5.1. Con: It is hard to determine if the delegation of decision making power is voluntary, as most citizens have never been asked about that.
1.8.5.1.1. Con: Most people have not been asked about the majority of the procedural features of modern democracy; this does not make them illegitimate.
1.8.5.2. Con: The delegation of political power in the hands of a few individuals can cause negative consequences for citizens, as [power corrupts](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/200908/how-power-corrupts-leaders).
1.8.5.2.1. Pro: There are many cases of corrupt popular and top-ranking politicians in democracies around the world, e.g. [Dilma Rousseff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilma_Rousseff), [Ehud Olmert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Olmert#Corruption_and_bribery_criminal_investigations) and [Najib Razak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najib_Razak#Corruption_accusations).
1.8.5.3. Pro: Even in a perfect direct democracy, resources, time, logistical and other constraints would prevent citizens from all participating to the same degree. This would undermine equality as a fundamental principle of democracy.
1.8.5.3.1. Pro: For example, having elections on weekdays \(such as [US presidential elections](http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/05/news/economy/poor-people-voting-rights/)\) increases costs for voters with lower socioeconomic status and [reduces their turnout](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/income-gap-at-the-polls-113997).
1.8.5.3.2. Pro: Referendums create internal or “decision-making” costs for the citizens, e.g. the time spent on becoming informed and then voting \([Matsusaka, p. 2](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~matsusak/Papers/Matsusaka_DD_PC_Encyclopedia.pdf)\).
1.8.5.3.2.1. Con: We should not conceive of time spent researching politics purely as a cost. There are many benefits that come from doing so.
1.8.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: Political deliberation can have positive flow-on effects such as fostering critical thinking skills and making voters more informed about issues affecting them. This should be considered a benefit, not a cost.
1.8.5.3.2.1.2. Pro: Political discussions among the general public have [various social signalling functions](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/05/political-signaling-theories.html) - for example, people become well-informed so they can appear intelligent in casual discussions of politics, or to signal that they are dedicated citizens who care about the world.
1.8.5.3.2.1.2.1. Con: For many people these signalling functions are probably of little relevance. [More than half](http://www.journalism.org/2015/06/01/political-interest-and-awareness-lower-among-millennials/) of all Americans and three out of four Millennials do not consider politics among their top-three interests; most do not talk about it even at least a few times every week.
1.8.5.3.2.2. Con: No one is forced \(mostly\) to vote on any given issue, nor to become informed before voting.
1.8.5.3.2.3. Pro: In a cost analysis of a proposed referendum in Australia, more than half the predicted cost would incur through the time it takes people to vote, travel and not spend their time otherwise \([PwC, p. 4](https://www.pwc.com.au/publications/pdf/marriage-equality-plebiscite-report-march-2016.pdf)\).
1.8.5.3.2.3.1. Con: This is vastly lessened when referendums are held at the same time as general elections \(as tends to happen in the USA\).
1.8.5.4. Pro: The basic principle of democracy is that all citizens are free participants in political decision-making. Hence, they are also principally free to make the choice of delegating their decision-making power to representatives.
1.8.6. Con: The citizens of democracies do not show much interest in exercising this right through referendums.
1.8.6.1. Con: Referendums are actually [on](https://uweserdult.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/national-level-referendum-frequencies-worldwide-by-continent-with-switzerland-singled-out-1792-2010/) [the](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/21/europes-referendum-mania-brexit/) [rise](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/political-science/2016/oct/06/why-referendums-are-problematic-yet-more-popular-than-ever) as an increasingly popular tool of political decision-making. Scholars estimate that while there were around 10 referendums every year in the 1960s to 1980s, this number is now closer to 50 worldwide.
1.8.6.1.1. Pro: In countries like Germany, about [three out of four](http://www.infratest-dimap.de/umfragen-analysen/bundesweit/umfragen/aktuell/hoher-zuspruch-fuer-bundesweite-volksentscheide-groessere-vorbehalte-bei-plebisziten-ueber-fluechtlingsp/) citizens would like to see more national referendums. In Great Britain, a [slight majority](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/poll-theresa-may-boris-johnson-britains-most-popular-politician-a7188871.html) and in the United States a [solid majority](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163433/americans-favor-national-referenda-key-issues.aspx) of citizens would like to be asked through referendums about major political decisions.
1.8.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.
1.8.6.3. Con: The fact that someone does not exercise a right does not imply that they are voluntarily forfeiting that right; someone who never attends a political protest does not lose their right to public assembly, or their right to free speech.
1.8.6.4. Con: The fact that few citizens participate in referendums does not necessarily indicate a revealed preference against the existence of referendums.
1.8.6.4.1. Pro: It is entirely possible that most voters are glad that referendums exist and glad that many people vote in them, but do not vote because they know that the chance of their vote making a difference is very small.
1.8.6.4.1.1. Con: If the entire point of referendums is that they are more directly representative, this purpose is eroded when few people are willing to participate in them, and therefore the principled justification for them is weakened.
1.8.6.4.2. Pro: In Switzerland, turnout for [referendums varies](https://uweserdult.wordpress.com/2012/10/31/average-annual-turnout-for-swiss-referendum-votes-1879-2011/) depending on how imminently relevant a topic is for voters and how competitive the political system is at a given time. If they do not care about a topic or think the difference between the different options is marginal, they often decide not to vote. However, they turn out again when these conditions change.
1.8.6.4.2.1. Pro: In these instances, low turnout is actually evidence of democracy working. Since only those with intense preferences about the result of the referendum vote, the result is a better aggregation of everyone's preferences.
1.8.6.5. Pro: There has been [increasing animosity](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-referendum-should-they-be-banned-a7194966.html) in Britain towards referendums as a concept.
1.8.6.6. Con: Participation in elections has been [declining](http://www.e-ir.info/2012/09/27/why-is-turnout-at-elections-declining-across-the-democratic-world/) across the democratic world in recent years. Yet using this as an argument that democracy as a political system should be abolished seems dubious.
1.8.6.6.1. Pro: The legitimacy of democratic is based on the fact that the coercive exercise of power by government requires the [consent](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democracy/#NonInsVal) of the governed - and not on the public support for democracy as a form of government.
1.8.6.6.2. Pro: If democracy can be justified on grounds independent of public support, then referendums can plausibly be justified in a similar way.
1.8.6.6.2.1. Pro: If public consent is a vital part of political legitimacy, then it can be argued that referendums are a necessary form of expression of public consent.
1.8.6.6.3. Con: If citizens don't believe in democracy then perhaps the best democratic outcome is to abolish it.
1.8.6.6.3.1. Con: The desires of current citizens aren't the only considerations that affect the choices a democratic government makes. Governments also frequently consider the lives of future citizens and those who are unable to make choices. Insofar as future generations will most likely desire to live under a democracy, we have a duty to preserve it as a political system for them.
1.8.6.6.3.1.1. Pro: Even though environmental policy is often harmful to the immediate productivity of society, governments still try to fight climate change for the sake of intergenerational equality.
1.8.6.6.3.1.2. Pro: The best short term economic policies for citizens would be no taxes with lots of services \(while governments rack up huge debts\). However this would be terrible for future generations which is one reason why the government doesn't do this.
1.8.6.6.3.1.3. Con: Insofar as the current generation dislikes democracy, this could indicate that future generations are likely to distrust it as well.
1.8.6.6.3.1.3.1. Con: Given that confidence in democracy has been strong for decades or even centuries in many modern democracies, it is likely better to treat current public mood as a temporary outlier, rather than thinking it is indicative of a trend that will continue into the future.
1.8.6.6.3.1.4. Con: Even if this logic is sound, and justifies preservation of democracy in the face of public opposition, the same does not apply to referendums. It is possible to temporarily abolish referendums, without denying future generations the opportunity to reintroduce them through a representative democracy.
1.8.6.6.3.2. Pro: There is something paradoxical about undemocratically imposing democracy as a political system.
1.8.6.6.3.2.1. Con: There is simultaneously something paradoxical about using a democratic justification for abolishing democracy.
1.8.6.6.4. Pro: Just because a right is not exercised does not mean that it is not valued. Else everybody who does not speak out in public would have to be assumed to oppose free speech rights.
1.8.6.7. Con: -> See 1.1.8.5.
1.8.7. Pro: Abolishing referendums would take away the population's only means of directly influencing political decision-making processes in representative democracies.
1.8.8. Pro: When the principles of modern democracy were being established, a true plebiscite was wholly impractical, necessitating the trustee model. Since modern technology allows instant communication with even the most remote citizens, referendums seem a more equitable means of decision making.
1.8.8.1. Con: The ability to vote remotely does not guarantee access to information necessary to understand one's vote. Having one without the other can undermine the referendum's intent to reflect the will of the people.
1.8.8.2. Pro: Referendums were not technologically possible when the current system was set up, so the fact that we have a trustee model under the status quo is not, in itself, evidence of what we value.
1.8.8.3. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.
1.8.8.4. Con: Even new models of e-democracy such as Liquid Democracy need to enable voters to [delegate their votes](http://www.tdcommons.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1092&context=dpubs_series) as a precondition for operating on a large-scale.
1.8.9. Con: While the people as the sovereign should be able to directly influence decisions in principle, this principle is impractical and cannot be implemented without limitations.
1.8.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.4.
1.8.9.2. Con: We should strive to reach an ideal state, even if it is ultimately unattainable.
1.8.9.2.1. Pro: A world without murder is presumably practically unfeasible, but that does not mean that perfect justice does not require the absence of murder.
1.8.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.5.3.
1.9. Con: Referendums encourage more popular political engagement.
1.9.1. Con: Given that there are other political mechanisms that can generate increased political engagement, it is not necessary to bear the many auxiliary costs associated with referendums.
1.9.1.1. Pro: [Deliberative democracy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/deliberative-democracy) is an approach that is superior to referendums because it typically attempts to reach consensus through consultation at every stage of the process, whereas the majoritarian focus of referendums has no such aims and is necessarily polarising.
1.9.1.1.1. Pro: A deliberative model of democracy [stresses the importance of voice.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379415000384) Referendums, on the contrary, prioritize votes.
1.9.1.1.1.1. Con: Deliberative processes are usually [biased in favour of powerful agents](https://www.ucalgary.ca/peacestudies/files/peacestudies/young-day-2.pdf) and risk entrenching existing power structures in society that e.g. afford more credibility to some participants based on their gender or way of speaking. While not as nuanced, simple voting processes treat every participant equally.
1.9.1.1.2. Pro: In 2012, the Irish government established a [constitutional convention](https://www.constitution.ie/Convention.aspx), a body made up of ordinary citizens, to deliberate on and recommend changes to the constitution. This process was generally considered to be [a success.](https://politicalreform.ie/2014/02/26/the-irish-constitutional-convention-completes-its-work/)
1.9.1.1.3. Pro: Theorists of [sortition](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/let-s-reimagine-democracy-replace-elections-with-lotteries-1.2870438) argue that bodies of citizens, selected randomly and frequently by lot, should be empowered to make important political decisions. This would function similarly to jury duty, but on a much larger scale.
1.9.1.1.3.1. Con: Just like juries, these bodies would risk perpetuating existing [structures of discrimination](http://www.ncsc-jurystudies.org/~/media/Microsites/Files/CJS/What%20We%20Do/Elek%20%20Hannaford-Agor%202015%20-%20Implicit%20bias%20and%20the%20American%20juror.ashx), especially since they cannot be held accountable for discriminating behaviour like politicians can.
1.9.1.1.4. Pro: A model which allows citizens to contribute at every stage of the policy making process rather than just the end is more democratic.
1.9.1.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.9.2. Con: Frequent referendums lead to voter fatigue and make elections seem less important, thereby [harming voter turnout.](https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=RESConf2016&paper_id=1009)
1.9.2.1. Pro: Although Switzerland holds [more referendums](http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2014-09-18/6-things-you-need-to-know-about-referendums/1369335) than any other country, its voter turnout in elections \(at around 50% or less\) is among the lowest in the OECD and has been low for decades \([OECD, p. 97](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/8111041ec029.pdf?expires=1486943091&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=705611406CD6C9EC244F6B9C3BE4B9BB)\).
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: Researchers have established a persistently negative correlation between referendums and the participation in elections for the case of Switzerland \([Freitag/ Stadelmann-Steffen, p. 479](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026137941000048X)\).
1.9.2.1.2. Pro: Voter fatigue and the perception that individual elections do not matter have been proposed as the link between the high number of referendums and the low voter turnout in Switzerland \([Blais, p. 526](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spsr.12116/abstract); [Franklin, p. 98](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=plYRx0sFT-cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Voter+Turnout+and+the+Dynamics+of+Electoral+Competition+in+established+Democracies+Since+1945&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Voter%20Turnout%20and%20the%20Dynamics%20of%20Electoral%20Competition%20in%20established%20Democracies%20Since%201945&f=false)\).
1.9.2.1.3. Con: The low voter turnout in Switzerland has not only been linked to issues relating to the country's frequent referendums, but also the "extraordinary complexity of the political system" \([Blais, p. 526](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spsr.12116/abstract)\).
1.9.2.1.4. Con: A country having a low turnout for elections need not necessarily be a bad thing in the context of a country like Switzerland where voters will maintain the power to influence policy precisely because there are so many referendums.
1.9.2.2. Pro: The number of referendums in European countries has been [steeply rising](https://uweserdult.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/national-level-referendum-frequencies-worldwide-by-continent-with-switzerland-singled-out-1792-2010/) during the past decades. At the same time, voter turnout has seen a steady decline \([IDEA, p. 26](http://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/voter-turnout-trends-around-the-world_0.pdf)\).
1.9.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.
1.9.2.2.2. Con: The existence of a correlation between the two does not prove any causation. The decline in voter participation has been linked to many other potential factors, among them the rise of [negative campaigning](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00522.x/full).
1.9.2.2.2.1. Con: While the negative correlation between the number of referendums and voter turnout in elections does not point to a causation, it nevertheless shows that there is no reason to assume that referendums encourage voting in elections.
1.9.2.3. Con: The effect of voter fatigue can be diminished by holding referendums on the same day as elections, thereby ensuring that people who turn up primarily to vote in referendums will probably also end up voting in elections.
1.9.2.3.1. Con: In many countries this would significantly decrease the number of opportunities to hold referendums. In Germany, for example, national elections take place only every four years.
1.9.2.3.1.1. Con: To mitigate that, Germany could arrange to have decisions worthy of a referendum be held midway between national elections. That way, elections would be infrequent enough to avoid fatigue, but more frequent than four years.
1.9.2.3.2. Con: Holding election and referendum campaigns at the same time will result in citizens being less informed about each vote individually as news coverage will be split between the two campaigns.
1.9.2.3.3. Pro: In the United States, research suggests that state-level [ballot initiatives](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_initiative) attached to Presidential and Midterm elections increased voter turnout \([Tolbert/Smith, p. 283](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X04271904)\).
1.9.2.3.4. Con: The combination of election and referendum has a higher risk that [protest votes](http://aceproject.org/electoral-advice/archive/questions/replies/579640459) against a government have a spillover effect on the referendum, and as a consequence distort the referendum's outcome.
1.9.3. Con: Referendums provide space for people already interested in politics to become active but do not engage with voters who have little interest in the first place \([Donovan/Karp, p. 684](http://www.jkarp.com/pdf/pp_2006.pdf)\).
1.9.3.1. Con: Though this is true of many referendums, campaigns for referendums on particularly emotive issues, [such as Ireland's vote on equal marriage](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/why-young-voters-mobilised-for-same-sex-marriage-1.2223723), can often be extremely successful in engaging with new voters, especially young ones.
1.9.3.1.1. Pro: This was also the case for the Brexit vote which had an above average turn [out of the electorate](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/23/high-turnout-for-eu-referendum-vote-could-break-uk-records/).
1.9.3.1.1.1. Con: The rates of voter turnout in the UK's [Brexit referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016) and its [parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Kingdom_general_elections) of the past decades were not markedly different.
1.9.3.2. Con: This is a feature, not a bug. Those who wish to make their voice heard are amplified by it, and those content to allow themselves to be silenced are provided less of an excuse to be dissatisfied with the result.
1.9.3.3. Pro: The patterns of those who vote in referendums and those who don't are identical to those seen in general elections.
1.9.3.3.1. Con: Referendums tend to mobilize voters who usually do not participate in ordinary elections.
1.9.3.3.1.1. Pro: Voter turnout in the Scottish referendum on its membership in the UK was about [70% higher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014) than in [parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Scotland#Scottish_Parliament) during the past 15 years.
1.9.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: Furthermore, [the Scottish Independence Referendum](http://www.referendumanalysis.eu/eu-referendum-analysis-2016/section-8-voters/did-the-eu-referendum-boost-youth-engagement-with-politics/) boosted, at least temporarily, the political engagement of the politically apathetic youth \(18-24 years olds\).
1.9.3.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.8.5.
1.9.3.3.1.3. Con: A direct comparison between the turnout for, or interest in, referendums and elections is not valid. Whereas most elections have no consequences of obvious and immediate impact, referendums usually concern policies of self-evident, high and long-term relevance.
1.9.3.3.1.3.1. Con: Even if it is just because the referendum issues are of high and obvious relevance, the very fact that voters now get a say in those issues increases engagement far more than if a non-responsive government were making decisions about them.
1.9.3.3.1.3.2. Pro: Additionally, even if the turnout for referendums is higher, that is likely to decrease if more referendums are used.
1.9.3.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.
1.9.3.3.1.4. Pro: Research conducted in Switzerland indicates that referendums contribute to a political culture in which young people feel confident to vote, and in which young people therefore participate to a higher degree in politics \([Kunz et al, p. 12](http://www.nccr-democracy.uzh.ch/publications/workingpaper/pdf/wp_56.pdf)\).
1.9.3.3.1.5. Con: -> See 1.9.3.1.1.1.
1.9.3.3.2. Pro: Older people are generally [more interested](http://www.journalism.org/2015/06/01/political-interest-and-awareness-lower-among-millennials/) in politics and more likely to vote, be it in referendums or elections.
1.9.3.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.
1.9.3.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.3.
1.9.3.3.2.3. Con: In the case of the Scottish referendum on independence in 2014, [surveys](http://www.democraticauditscotland.com/the-independence-referendum-shows-that-young-people-can-be-mobilized-politically-given-the-right-circumstances/) indicate that it sparked a rise in young peoples' political interest, engagement and activism.
1.9.3.3.2.4. Con: Surveys [show](http://www.referendumanalysis.eu/eu-referendum-analysis-2016/section-8-voters/did-the-eu-referendum-boost-youth-engagement-with-politics/) that the Brexit referendum of 2016 "stimulated the political interest of Britain’s young people to an extent not seen for some years".
1.9.3.3.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.1.2.
1.9.4. Pro: Referendums on local issues are necessary to the democratic process. The process of local ballot initiatives could eventually, with existing voting impediments removed, create better informed, more engaged voters. Although there is little evidence to support the claim currently, they could also increase voter turnout as they have in California in some cases. 

[THE EFFECTS OF BALLOT INITIATIVES ON VOTER TURNOUT IN THE AMERICAN STATES](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.525.7827&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

[Ballot Measures: American Direct Democracy at Work](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/opinion/campaign-stops/ballot-measures-american-direct-democracy-at-work.html)
1.9.5. Pro: The electorate is more likely to turn out and vote for particular subjects they care about than for general political elections.
1.9.5.1. Con: -> See 1.9.3.3.1.3.
1.9.5.2. Pro: In the [Scottish referendum](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/06/daily-chart-16) on independence in 2014, turnout was 85%, the highest for any vote in Britain since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1928.
1.9.5.2.1. Con: Referendums on independence are a unique case as they affect the future of a nation, its politics and economics, and the identity of its citizens like few other decisions.
1.9.5.2.1.1. Pro: Other referendums on independence, too, had a voter turnout far higher than what is usually the case. In [Eritrea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrean_independence_referendum,_1993) in 1993 it stood at 99%, in [Quebec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_referendum,_1995) in 1995 at 95%, in [East Timor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timorese_independence_referendum,_1999) in 1999 at 99%, in [Montenegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegrin_independence_referendum,_2006) in 2006 at 87%, in [South Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudanese_independence_referendum,_2011) in 2011 at 98%, and in [Puerto Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_status_referendum,_2012) in 2012 at 80%.
1.9.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.3.3.
1.9.5.4. Con: -> See 1.1.8.5.
1.9.6. Pro: Having regular referendums, or at least the knowledge that they might occur, encourages people to be informed on major issues, as they might have to weigh in on them.
1.9.6.1. Con: If referendums become a routine occurrence, their special status will diminish and many citizens will stop preparing for them.
1.9.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.
1.9.6.2. Con: Considering that major referendums are relatively rare and unpredictable, it's doubtful that the possibility of a referendum will be sufficient to encourage voters to be informed about a particular topic.
1.9.6.2.1. Con: Even if they are relatively rare, they tend to be scheduled well in advance giving lots of time for citizens to become informed on the required issues.
1.9.6.2.1.1. Con: Although announced [on time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016), large parts of the [British public](https://www.rt.com/uk/346342-brexit-voters-ignorance-misinformation/) were not well prepared for the "Brexit" referendum and had a misguided perception of the EU, mainly due to ignorance and misinformation, and thus voted to leave.
1.9.7. Pro: By forcing politicians to appeal directly to voters at times other than elections, referendums increase public engagement with government.
1.9.7.1. Pro: In Switzerland, the federal government developed procedures to consult interest groups about new legislation to ensure that policy proposals would not face referendum challenges \([Geber & Hug 2001, p. 91](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9781403900968_5)\)
1.9.8. Pro: Referendums result in more interest in politics.
1.9.8.1. Pro: Surveys conducted one and a half years after the referendum on Scottish independence in 2014 [indicate](http://www.natcen.ac.uk/news-media/press-releases/2016/april/scots%E2%80%99-interest-in-politics-reaches-all-time-high/) that it has led to a significant and sustained rise in Scottish population's interest in politics.
1.9.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.3.3.1.1.1.
1.9.8.2. Con: -> See 1.9.3.3.1.3.
1.9.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.3.3.2.4.
1.9.9. Con: Engagement does not necessarily increase [satisfaction](http://www.gallup.com/poll/196388/satisfaction-remains-low-leading-election.aspx) with politics. If the referendum campaign is marred by populist appeals rather than reasonable discourse, it can instead reduce public happiness.
1.9.9.1. Con: Dissatisfaction with politics is often driven by the perception that political elites are unresponsive to the wishes of voters. Referendums provide a unique kind of engagement where the wishes of voters are necessarily respected, and so can combat dissatisfaction.
1.10. Pro: Referendums create enormous costs for a variety of actors.
1.10.1. Con: In a democracy, the cost of decision-making is not the proper standard to judge procedures. Otherwise, not only referendums, but also elections and democracy as a whole would have to be called into question.
1.10.1.1. Con: Nevertheless, it is necessary to question whether each and every expenditure in the service of democracy is necessary - for example the widely-loathed, expensive "[travelling circus](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/10565686/The-farce-of-the-EU-travelling-circus.html)" of the European parliament.
1.10.2. Con: Referendums can be held on the same days as elections. This leads to significant [cost reduction](http://aceproject.org/electoral-advice/archive/questions/replies/579640459), since ballot papers can be distributed at the same time, the same voters lists can be used, polling place personnel can be employed once instead of twice, voter information packages can be put together with information about both events and postage can be saved by sending it out only once.
1.10.2.1. Con: -> See 1.9.2.3.1.
1.10.2.2. Con: Despite overall savings, the practical, logistical and economic [burden](http://aceproject.org/electoral-advice/archive/questions/replies/579640459) on a country will be enormous as certain things will take longer, e.g. counting and reporting, and be more complicated and costly, e.g. voter information campaigns.
1.10.3. Con: The fact that people are willing to incur the costs of spending time voting and becoming informed shows that they value the ability to participate in a referendum more than they value those costs. Getting rid of referendums would therefore be socially harmful.
1.10.3.1. Con: Even participation in regular elections has been [declining](http://www.e-ir.info/2012/09/27/why-is-turnout-at-elections-declining-across-the-democratic-world/) across the democratic world in recent years. It is not clear why voters would be willing to bear these costs for referendums if they already refuse to do so on the rare occasion of general elections.
1.10.3.2. Con: -> See 1.9.2.
1.10.4. Con: -> See 1.4.7.
1.10.5. Con: The cost of a referendum is not a reason to not hold it. If it is deemed necessary for an effective democracy, it should be held regardless of cost.
1.10.6. Pro: -> See 1.8.5.3.2.
1.10.7. Pro: The large direct and indirect monetary costs of referendums use up resources that may be needed in other parts of the democratic system.
1.10.7.1. Pro: In the case of a proposed referendum in Australia on same-sex marriage, it was estimated that NGOs would spend tens of millions of dollars on campaigns, thus diverting funding from people who would profit from it \([PwC, p. 3](https://www.pwc.com.au/publications/pdf/marriage-equality-plebiscite-report-march-2016.pdf)\).
1.10.7.1.1. Con: The money spent by LGBT groups on the proposed referendum would have been well spent given the policy's great benefits for LGBT people.
1.10.7.2. Pro: During the run-up to the Brexit referendum, more than [6.4 million Pounds](http://www.politico.eu/article/eu-referendum-brexit-leave-has-more-cash-than-remain/) were given to campaign groups by financial backers. This money could have been spent elsewhere.
1.10.7.2.1. Con: There is no guarantee that this money would have been put to good use if the referendum might not have happened. Donors might have just kept it in their bank accounts.
1.10.7.2.2. Con: If the campaign served to further educate and engage the public, money spent on it should not be considered wasted.
1.10.7.2.2.1. Con: The Brexit campaign was notorious for [spreading misinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/brexit-cps-considers-complaint-that-leave-campaigns-misled-voters) instead of actually informing voters.
1.10.7.3. Pro: In Italy a [referendum](http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21699146-direct-democracy-spreading-across-europe-not-always-good-thing-referendumania) in April 2016 on whether or not offshore oil rigs should continue operating, did not reach the 50% turnout required—but still cost around €300 million \($340 million\).
1.10.7.3.1. Con: This is an argument for making voting in referendums mandatory, not that they should not exist at all.
1.10.7.3.1.1. Con: Compulsory voting is arguably a violation of civil liberties, so it is not a viable solution to problems with turnout.
1.10.7.3.1.2. Pro: -> See discussion #1692: Citizens in democratic states should be required to vote or be fined.
1.10.7.4. Pro: The 2016 [Brexit Referendum](http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/659345/EU-Referendum-2016-Cost-How-Much-Spent-Government-Campaigns-Political-Parties) cost an estimated total of £142.4 million for running more than 41,000 polling stations, counting votes, organizing postal voting and providing polling cards.
1.10.7.5. Pro: A proposed referendum in Australia about the legal status of same-sex marriages has been estimated to cause direct costs of about $244 million \([PwC, p. ii](https://www.pwc.com.au/publications/pdf/marriage-equality-plebiscite-report-march-2016.pdf)\).
1.10.7.6. Pro: The British government spent [£9.3 million](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/06/eu-referendum-taxpayers-to-fund9m-leaflet-to-every-home-warning/) on a leaflet to every UK home only to warn about the potential dangers of a "Brexit".
1.11. Pro: Referendums create or deepen political divisions within a society.
1.11.1. Pro: Referendums shift the burden of partisanship from politicians to members of the public.
1.11.1.1. Pro: [One in four families](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/19/kevin-mckenna-scottish-referendum-family-divided) in Scotland experienced family arguments as a result of the independence referendum in 2014.
1.11.1.1.1. Con: If there was a rift between those families like suggested then it obviously existed long before the referendum.
1.11.1.1.2. Con: At the same time, the vast majority of voters -[about 90%](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/20/scottish-independence-lord-ashcroft-poll) - expressed that they would have no problems to tell friends, family or colleagues about how they voted. Thus, any arguments resulting from this were likely not very severe.
1.11.1.2. Con: Individual displays of partisanship are not exclusive to referendums and their outcomes. Elections have the same potential.
1.11.1.2.1. Con: Arguably, referendums focus on tangible issues that evoke more passions and polarization than elections, which are only about the choice of representatives and are without clear-cut and immediate consequences for individual citizens.
1.11.1.2.1.1. Con: The chance that an individual policy does not affect a particular citizen is far higher than the chance that all policies in the coming term of government do not.
1.11.1.2.2. Pro: The election of Donald Trump divided the whole of [American society](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/after-trumps-election-there-are-two-americas-now/2016/11/21/12fa26c8-acec-11e6-8b45-f8e493f06fcd_story.html?utm_term=.d188ae7c158f), [families](http://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2016/12/28/trump-divided-my-family-viceland-helped-bring-us-back-together) and even [relationships](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/us/political-divide-splits-relationships-and-thanksgiving-too.html).
1.11.1.2.3. Con: Whilst referendums are optional in a democracy, elections are not. The division caused by referendums is therefore avoidable \(by abolishing them\) in a way that the division caused by elections is not.
1.11.1.2.3.1. Con: This would also be an argument for holding less frequent elections. Decisions have to be made in a democracy, and that requires division.
1.11.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.11.2. Con: Referendums provide a way of [overcoming political and partisan divides](http://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-direct-democracy-trouble-with-referendums-eu-leave/) by letting people decide based on issues rather than party allegiance.
1.11.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.
1.11.2.2. Pro: Brexit united supporters of the [Conservative Party \(58%\)](http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/), Labour \(37%\), the Greens \(25%\), the Liberal Democrats \(36%\) and the SNP \(36%\) – parties which hardly ever see eye to eye in everyday politics.
1.11.2.2.1. Con: A different interpretation of these numbers is that voting took place along partisan lines, after all. A majority of the Conservatives voted for Brexit; about two thirds of all other parties' supporters voted against it.
1.11.2.3. Con: As the options in many referendums are linked with certain personalities, voters can still orient themselves with politicians they like or dislike. For example, voters followed Boris Johnson's in the Brexit campaign or Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the Turkish referendum on constitutional reform.
1.11.2.3.1. Pro: In the Brexit referendum in 2016, having a [positive view of Boris Johnson](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/05/04/why-britain-voted-to-leave-and-what-boris-johnson-had-to-do-with-it/) or Nigel Farage increased voters' likelihood of voting Leave.
1.11.3. Pro: Referendums provide an additional stage on which class and social divisions can be emphasized. New awareness of these divisions can then be used to differentiate between "us" and "them" or to assign blame for political outcomes.
1.11.3.1. Pro: In the Brexit referendum, [70% university graduates](http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/06/britains-great-divide/) voted to remain, whilst 68% of those with only the lowest level of high school qualification \(GCSE\) voted to leave.
1.11.3.2. Pro: In the Brexit referendum 62% of the highest social classes [voted to remain](http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/06/britains-great-divide/), whilst 63% of the lowest social classes voted to leave.
1.11.3.3. Pro: If voters have a very negative view of other political parties due to populist campaigning during a referendum, they are much more likely to disapprove of compromises with those parties in the future.
1.11.3.3.1. Pro: Post-Brexit discussions closely [reflect the divisive rhetoric](http://ukandeu.ac.uk/brexit-negotiations-are-likely-to-drive-a-wedge-between-already-fractioned-groups-of-british-society/) employed by the campaigns before the referendum.
1.11.3.4. Con: Political party affiliation [cleaves closely](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.1959.5.3.337?journalCode=prxa) to social class. It is unclear why position on an individual policy would make the political differences that are associated with class and income any more obvious than it already is.
1.11.3.5. Pro: The fact that voters usually use referendums as a means to [punish the ruling party](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/research/microsites/epop/pdfs/Laycock_-_The_Distinctiveness_of_Referendum_Voting.pdf) shows that voter choice in referendums reproduces existing divisions instead of voting for people's actual opinion.
1.11.4. Pro: The all-or-nothing nature of referendums incentivises campaigns to present the issue as a zero-sum game, where winning or losing are the only two possibilities and where compromise is not an option.
1.11.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.11.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.1.
1.11.5. Con: Referendums don't create the divisions, they at most highlight the divisions that already exist.  And knowing the truth of things is almost always good.
1.11.5.1. Con: While it's true referendums don't directly create division, where the premise of a referendum question is "simple", support becomes significantly more polarised towards either side of the divide.
1.11.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.11.6. Con: Referendums help settle the divides of the public in a way that is final. The public agrees to hold the referendum and respect its result, making the decision acceptable even by opponents.
1.11.6.1. Con: In referendums in countries such as the UK the people do not have a legal right to invoke a plebiscite. So it is not 'their' contract but a contract given them by the state. In those circumstances the idea that a referendum result is respected is not endorsed by the will of the people. This is why afterwards everyone argues about the implications, meanings, interpretations etc. The divides of the people actually end up becoming entrenched behind bitter lines rather than settled.
1.11.6.2. Con: Referendums are often not final. If the "powers that be" do not like the result, they can often put the issue up again and again \(with very minor differences\) until they get the desired result.
1.11.6.2.1. Pro: The citizens of Denmark rejected the Maastricht Treaty in a referendum [in 1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Maastricht_Treaty_referendum,_1992). One year later, in 1993 and after some concessions by the European Union, [another referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Maastricht_Treaty_referendum,_1993) on the same issue took place and was successful.
1.11.6.2.1.1. Con: Denmark won significant concessions between the two votes through the [Edinburgh Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Agreement_\(1992\)). Voters did therefore not decide about the exact same policy twice.
1.11.6.2.2. Pro: The citizens of Ireland voted [in 2001 and 2002](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/18/eu.politics1) on the EU's Treaty of Nice, first rejecting it, then accepting it.
1.11.6.2.2.1. Con: Between the two referendums the government of Ireland and the leaders of the European Union agreed on the [Seville Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville_Declarations_on_the_Treaty_of_Nice) that signaled to voters that Ireland would not easily be drawn in EU military operations.
1.11.6.2.3. Pro: After rejecting the European Union's Treaty of Lisbon in a referendum [in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-eighth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_Bill_2008_\(Ireland\)), the citizens of Ireland were asked to vote again on the same issue [in 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-eighth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland).
1.11.6.2.3.1. Con: The EU made [several concessions](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ireland-set-to-win-lisbon-treaty-concessions-1708995.html) to Ireland between the two referendums that were meant to protect the country's sovereignty in various areas.
1.11.7. Con: But they also open up debate. The Scottish independence referendum, for example, got people in the country discussing politics in a way they never had before
1.11.8. Con: A bargain or decision made by the elites without public consultation or endorsement only strengthens the division between the political elite and parts of the citizens.
1.11.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.1.1.1.
1.12. Pro: The average citizen, unlike a professional politician, is not able to make well-grounded decisions about complex political subject matters.
1.12.1. Con: While individual citizens might not be well-informed, referendum decisions benefit from the [wisdom of the crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd) through which individual deficiencies are cancelled out.
1.12.1.1. Pro: Politicians, in contrast to millions of voters from different walks of life, are more prone to mistakes due to their small numbers and their relative sameness in many regards.
1.12.1.1.1. Pro: The members of the American Congress are much wealthier than the vast majority of American citizens.
1.12.1.1.1.1. Pro: As of 2015, more than half of all members of Congress had net worth of [more than one million dollars](http://1,029,505/56,355). That's more than 18 times the net worth of the average American household.
1.12.1.1.1.2. Pro: The median net worth of American families has declined by a third between 2007 and 2013. The average member of Congress, at the same time, saw his/her net worth [increase by 20%](http://1,029,505/56,355) over the same time span.
1.12.1.1.2. Pro: As of 2015, a third of British members of parliament had attended a private school \(which is the case for only 7% of the general population\); a quarter had studied in either Oxford of Cambridge; and there is a strong bias towards politicians with a previous background in business, finance, law and politics \([Hunter/Holden, p. 2](https://smithinstitutethinktank.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/who-governs-britain.pdf)\).
1.12.1.1.2.1. Pro: A disproportionate number of the English political elite not only went to Oxford, but studied the [same degree](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university-degree-that-rules-britain) there.
1.12.1.1.3. Pro: Regardless of whether one looks at OECD members, EU members or high income-countries in general, the average share of female members in parliaments is [below 30%](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SG.GEN.PARL.ZS?year_high_desc=true).
1.12.1.2. Pro: Political philosophers have argued that individual voters' ignorance [does not matter](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08913811.2015.1111669) because they are part of a larger system that makes decisions collectively.
1.12.1.3. Con: The "wisdom of the crowds" depends on individuals making [independent decisions](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140708-when-crowd-wisdom-goes-wrong) that balance each other out. This is usually not the case for referendums where opinion polls influence individuals and draw them towards the winning side through [bandwagon effects](https://theconversation.com/how-political-opinion-polls-affect-voter-behaviour-60554).
1.12.2. Pro: Voters behave irrationally.
1.12.2.1. Con: -> See 1.8.3.1.3.1.
1.12.2.2. Con: If voters behave irrationally, there is no reason to assume that politicians who represent them behave any more rationally, or that parliamentary decisions are superior to referendums.
1.12.2.2.1. Con: Politicians usually work in an institutionalized context, such as that of political parties with voting discipline, where the influence of impulsive decisions and factors such as short-lived moods hardly play a role.
1.12.2.3. Pro: Voters are susceptible to influences in their decision making that make it difficult to perceive them as rational.
1.12.2.3.1. Pro: Voters in American Presidential elections evaluate politicians based on events beyond their control. For example, voters punish the incumbent party for the economic losses incurred by tornadoes regardless of the actual policy response. This has been [interpreted as irrational](http://myweb.lmu.edu/ahealy/healy_malhotra_random_0310.pdf).
1.12.2.3.2. Pro: The American presidential election in 2000 between George Bush and Al Gore was close until the last days when the sheer volume of Bush's advertising campaign led to an advantage for him. That voters are susceptible to this hardly qualifies as rational \([Jonston et al., p. 184-6](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=HNqu79LXIqkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+2000+Presidential+Election+and+the+Foundations+of+Party+Politics&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjG7JHayPrTAhVOv5QKHRRxAk4Q6AEIITAA#v=onepage&q=The%20typical%20forecast%20placed%20Gore%20some%20eight%20points%20ahead%20of&f=false)\).
1.12.2.3.3. Pro: A famous example illustrating this point is the way in which American voters punished the incumbent President Wilson in 1916 for a series of random effects beyond politicians control that were seen as negative for voters' subjective well-being: shark attacks \([Achen/Bartels, p. 24f.](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/research/CSDI_WP_05-2013.pdf)\).
1.12.2.3.3.1. Con: The paper that made this argument has been [called into question](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/28/do-shark-attacks-swing-elections/?utm_term=.b1363aefa320) due to methodological flaws. Adjusting the analysis accordingly reveals that the effect of irrelevant events on voting behavior were overblown.
1.12.2.3.4. Pro: Research [indicates that](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/29/12804.full) even the results of college football games can influence voting behavior, with wins leading to increased support for incumbents.
1.12.2.3.4.1. Con: The study behind this argument has been [called into question](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/45/13800.full.pdf) as it might represent a false positive based on bad luck in the data selection. Other evidence points to no causal relation between football results and voting decisions.
1.12.2.3.4.2. Pro: These results received cautious confirmation from [another study](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jnd260/pub/Irrelevant%20JOP.pdf) that linked the positive mood resulting from football wins to a rise in presidential approval ratings. As the authors caution, this result is based on a small sample and shows only short-lived changes in approval.
1.12.2.3.4.3. Pro: Similar results were found by [a study](https://b2998732-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/mkmtwo/Miller-Sports.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cqu1Y-PknbqcHAc3_VFKWcg49bDAj6_RtC0NAukOducN07TE9rJHLUzn9u3eWejtyHf2JriCLK8-Zwu8sjARKXTiG6l7kW5eKcC4VjltZYCLFs6lj1zWJ0aWY9_2NX6_Uakn0pfH4kllPKGQlqUzOvWZtBiP6t6O1_oskPFW24mCy8Za5n4NBZ1mi-vYaqzXod4up4GX8XxyAvBdHNICvGYm4Ns9w%3D%3D&attredirects=0) on the effects of sports results of professional teams on mayoral elections in several dozen American cities over a period of six decades.
1.12.2.3.5. Pro: Instead of selecting candidates based on the policies they advocate, voters select them for other reasons, among them party affiliation or even appearance. Once a favorite candidate has been chosen, "voters often adopt that candidate's policy views" \([Lenz, p. 18](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=5AJEAqd4XAAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Follow+the+Leader?&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiu8o7uzPrTAhWKnZQKHSF2AL0Q6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=%22for%20other%20reasons%2C%20such%20as%20performance%20advantages%2C%20party%2C%20or%20superficial%20traits%20such%20as%20appearance%22&f=false)\).
1.12.2.3.5.1. Con: The subject matter and policy focus of referendums would strongly mitigate the voters' superficial focus on specific persons.
1.12.2.3.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.11.2.3.
1.12.2.3.5.2. Pro: The infamous presidential television debate between Kennedy and Nixon in 1960 [illustrates](http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/kennedy-nixon-debates) how the performance and even the appearance of a candidate can shift the public opinion about an otherwise even-handed debate. Referendums do not suffer from this effect.
1.12.2.3.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.11.2.3.
1.12.2.3.5.2.2. Pro: Arguably, Al Gore lost the 2000 election because he came off as  [arrogant and condescending](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/25/us/politics/george-w-bush-al-gore-2000-presidential-debate.html) in his first televised debate against Bush, despite possessing far superior policy knowledge.
1.12.2.3.6. Pro: Voters decide by the looks of politicians. Studies show that baby-faced politicians are perceived as [less competent](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103109001383) and that [good looks](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727270900142X) can translate into electoral success.
1.12.2.3.6.1. Pro: The results of elections can even be predicted [by asking children](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5918/1183.full) to choose candidates based on photos. They may not have political knowledge but apparently pick candidates in the same way as do voters.
1.12.2.3.6.2. Con: This can also be explained with the apathy that voters feel under the current circumstances. It causes them not to pursue information - and when they are confronted with an electoral choice, they decide based on superficial factors.
1.12.2.3.7. Pro: Psychology interferes with rational decision making. Exposure to disgusting or disturbing information, for example, led the participants of a study to express stronger convictions and harsher moral judgments \([Ben-Nun Bloom, p. 510](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12053/abstract)\).
1.12.2.3.7.1. Pro: These effects can even be replicated for incidental, non-conscious influences. In [a study](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611414726), brief exposure to images of an American flag led to a shift in voting preferences towards Republican positions for participants regardless of their prior attitudes and believe that this would not happen.
1.12.2.4. Con: If voters behave irrationally, elections are not any better than referendums as both suffer from voters' irrationality.
1.12.2.4.1. Pro: In fact, elections exacerbate the impact of irrationality as they involve decisions about people rather than subject matter and are influenced by all the sympathies and antipathies that make inter-human relations hardly rational.
1.12.2.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.3.5.2.
1.12.2.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.11.2.3.
1.12.2.4.2. Con: The introduction of referendums increases the number of occasions, apart from elections, in which voters' irrationality shapes political outcomes.
1.12.2.5. Con: As voting is considered to be an [irrational act](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/07/voting-irrational-emotions-politics-ideology) in general \(since the probability of affecting the outcome is virtually nonexistent\), citizens behave irrationally every time they go to the polls, no matter how rationally they decide. Thus irrational behavior cannot be an argument against democratic decision making.
1.12.2.5.1. Con: Voting is [not irrational](http://www.philosophyetc.net/2016/07/the-instrumental-value-of-one-vote.html). If we assume that one party is substantially better than the other, the expected value of voting is [positive](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/probdecisive2.pdf), because the costs of having a bad party are very high. Therefore, irrationality is not inherent to the act of voting, and rationality is a valid measure for assessing voter behaviour.
1.12.2.5.2. Con: Voting may be irrational if seen strictly from the perspective of the individual. But it becomes rational to vote once it is taken into account that democratic systems would collapse if each and every voter would act - according to this logic - rational and not vote.
1.12.2.6. Pro: According to the theory of [Rational Irrationality](http://www.owl232.net/irrationality.htm#4), voters adopt irrational beliefs as the costs of becoming informed \(time, mental effort\) exceed the benefits.
1.12.2.6.1. Pro: In contrast, professional politicians have an incentive to stem the high costs of rational beliefs as their careers depend on a rational-acting image in the media.
1.12.2.6.1.1. Con: Even if politicians were able to act in more rational ways than voters, they would still have to appeal to these supposedly irrational voters in order to secure their own position. This eliminates the incentive to put a premium on rationality.
1.12.2.7. Con: The [lack of a single agreed-upon definition](http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396577/obo-9780195396577-0175.xml) of rationality shows how controversial the definition of rationality is. This implies that it is impossible to objectively determine whether a single act is irrational.
1.12.2.7.1. Con: Even though we lack a single agreed-upon definition, there is a general understanding of what constitutes rational behavior. And while one can disagree about the rationality of specific actions, there is little dispute about the observation that voters do not live up to the standard of fully rational behavior.
1.12.2.8. Pro: Voters do not act in accordance with their own opinions and stated preferences. This clearly is a case of irrational behavior.
1.12.2.8.1. Pro: The American Congress usually has a public approval rating of below 20%; a third of voters believe that their representative is corrupt, half that they are out of touch and serve special interests \([Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx)\). Yet only about 5% of the members of Congress who run for re-election in any given year are voted out of office \([CRS, p. 6](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41545.pdf)\).
1.12.2.8.1.1. Con: This behaviour is rational if voters equally believed that their representative's opponents are equally corrupt, out of touch, or subservient to special interests.
1.12.2.8.2. Pro: Right before the presidential elections that kept Clinton, Bush and Obama in office for another four years, a [majority of voters](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1669/general-mood-country.aspx) were dissatisfied with the general direction the country was heading into - yet they chose to reelect the incumbent.
1.12.2.8.2.1. Con: It is questionable whether this data can tell us much. The last time a majority of Americans was actually satisfied with the direction of the country [was in 2003](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1669/general-mood-country.aspx). Voter satisfaction thus seems generally low.
1.12.2.8.2.2. Con: This preference set is not irrational. It's perfectly reasonable to think that the country is heading in a bad direction, but that the incumbent is nevertheless the better of two bad options.
1.12.2.9. Con: -> See 1.8.3.1.5.
1.12.3. Pro: Politicians are held responsible for their decisions and thus have an incentive to be well-informed. Conversely, it [has been argued](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/10/the-dance-of-the-dunces-trump-clinton-election-republican-democrat/) that most voters are ignorant or misinformed as they pay no price for it, and as there is no direct benefit for making an effort at educating themselves.
1.12.3.1. Pro: The exact reason we elect representatives in the first place is to act as "trustees." We empower them to make decisions so that most people do not have to concern themselves with the intricacies of national policy, rather they choose someone to do that on their behalf.
1.12.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.12.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.8.8.
1.12.3.1.3. Con: Looking at the nature of trustees in democracies, it is questionable whether they actually represent the characteristics of the populace and, subsequently, can represent its interests. Referendums do not suffer from this problem.
1.12.3.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.1.1.2.
1.12.3.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.12.1.1.3.
1.12.3.1.3.3. Con: Referendums are not necessarily representative of the composition and characteristics of the populace either.
1.12.3.1.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.4.1.
1.12.3.1.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.
1.12.3.1.3.4. Pro: Citizens without a high level of formal education are under-represented in most parliaments.
1.12.3.1.3.4.1. Pro: As of 2016, all members of the American Senate and 94% of the members of the House had at least a Bachelor's degree \([CRS, p. 4](https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/c527ba93-dd4a-4ad6-b79d-b1c9865ca076.pdf)\). Among the general population this share stands at 33% \([US Census Bureau, p. 1](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p20-578.pdf)\).
1.12.3.1.3.4.2. Pro: As of 2010, [eight out of ten](http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1314/43rdParl) members of the Australian parliament had a post-secondary education degree. The share in the general population meanwhile stood at less than half that \([OECD, p. 2](https://www.oecd.org/edu/Australia_EAG2013%20Country%20Note.pdf)\).
1.12.3.1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.12.1.1.1.
1.12.3.1.4. Con: Referendums [do not abolish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum#Rationale) representative democracy, but serve as an addition when current elected officials may not have the legitimacy to decide, for example in case of [constitutional revisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_constitutional_referendum,_2016) or decisions with wide-ranging, long-term consequences, for example on [national independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_referendum).
1.12.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.
1.12.3.3. Con: The claim that voters pay no cost for false opinions may not be true. Under [signalling theories](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/05/political-signaling-theories.html) of political discussion, for example, appearing well-informed boosts social status and signals intelligence, giving voters an incentive to retain quality knowledge.
1.12.3.3.1. Con: Signalling considerations can also incentivize behaviors other than truth-seeking - for example, wanting to appear contrarian, or within the range of reasonable opinion, or signalling membership of a particular group. All of these considerations may cause people to espouse claims regardless of their truth-value.
1.12.4. Con: Even if politicians were more educated than voters, they would still have to appeal to them and presumably act in their interest in order to keep their job. Hence, concerns of voters influence politicians, even if they happen to be based on a lack of understanding or information.
1.12.4.1. Pro: [Half of all Americans](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/04/public-views-on-climate-change-and-climate-scientists/) believe that climate change is either not happening or happening because of non-human causes. This takes away incentives from politicians to promote a clear climate change agenda, even if they follow the scientific consensus on the issue.
1.12.4.2. Con: Most voters are unaware of the individual decisions made by individual politicians. It is only on high profile issues where they become more generally aware \(and they still may be unaware of the way their own representative voted\).
1.12.4.2.1. Pro: Even when it comes to recent or especially prominent policies, only a small minority of voters is aware of how their own representative voted \([Clinton/Tessin, p. 26](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/joshclinton/files/2011/10/CT_WP2008.pdf)\).
1.12.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.4.
1.12.4.3. Pro: In 2016, Donald Trump was elected on a platform of positions - against free trade and against immigration - that [appealed precisely to](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/10/the-dance-of-the-dunces-trump-clinton-election-republican-democrat/) badly informed voters and went against the positions of well-informed voters.
1.12.5. Con: Democracy comes with the freedom to be uninformed and to make bad or wrong decisions.
1.12.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.1.2.
1.12.5.2. Con: Democracy comes with the duty to be informed.
1.12.5.2.1. Con: The larger the democracy, the more intractable and inefficient it is for every citizen to be informed. In addition, the means by which information is disseminated is unreliable.
1.12.5.2.2. Pro: In a democracy, the people constitute the sovereign. This gives them a duty to act accordingly by making informed decisions.
1.12.5.3. Con: A bad choice of elected representatives has less impact on societies than a bad decision about direct subject matters.
1.12.5.3.1. Pro: Politicians work within political systems with checks and balances that limit their power and influence.
1.12.5.3.2. Pro: As elections take place at regular intervals, citizens have the opportunity to vote bad politicians out of office. Compared to that, bad subject matter decisions are usually long-term oriented, and sometimes irreversible.
1.12.5.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.3.
1.12.5.3.3. Pro: Referendums can be used to change the constitution; something that is very hard for politicians to do. Constitutional changes can have a tremendous impact on the institutional system of a democracy as well as on society.
1.12.5.3.3.1. Pro: In [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2017) a referendum was used to strengthen the competences of the president. This will [enduringly change](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/04/16/rip-turkey-1921-2017/) the political system of the country.
1.12.5.3.4. Con: In presidential systems, the head of state and government has wide overarching powers. In the wrong hands, they can cause great harm to a country. For example, the President of the United States, as Commander-In-Chief, can authorize a [nuclear attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Codes).
1.12.5.3.5. Con: Representatives are usually elected for multiple years and influence hundreds of decisions over this time period. Referendums, on the other hand, usually focus on single issues.
1.12.5.3.6. Con: Even policy decisions made by referendum are still mediated through and implemented by elected politicians. They have the power to make a terrible decision bearable or implement good decisions in a damaging way.
1.12.5.3.6.1. Pro: After the Brexit referendum, there was [considerable uncertainty](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37500140) about how exactly the UK would leave the European Union. Ultimately, this decision was up to the politicians that formed the British government.
1.12.6. Con: The problem is more that the voters aren't given the full information as opposed to a lack of capacity.
1.12.6.1. Pro: Politicians have access to research and information services that ordinary citizens do not have.
1.12.6.1.1. Con: In many countries, the analyses and reports by parliamentary research services are mostly available to the public and for free, for example in [Canada](http://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/About/Library/VirtualLibrary/ResearchPublications-e.asp), [Germany](https://www.bundestag.de/analysen), [Australia](http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs),the [UK](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/) and in the case of the [European Parliament](https://epthinktank.eu/topical-digests/).
1.12.6.1.1.1. Con: Due to time constraints or lack of interest, it is unlikely that a substantial percentage of registered voters actually access this information.
1.12.6.1.2. Pro: In most countries, the access to classified information [is restricted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information) by law or regulation. Information classified ‘For Official Use Only’ is not accessible by the wider public.
1.12.6.1.3. Con: This is why direct democratic tools are important so that knowledge that is important for the future of a society is not hidden away. In Switzerland where public votes and referendums are common, the authorities are required to create a [Abstimmungsbüchlein](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstimmungsb%C3%BCchlein) \(voter information booklet\) as part of the voting documents to list pros and cons of the coming vote. In addition to this, there is the "Arena" on TV where the political parties discuss the coming vote.
1.12.6.1.4. Con: The notion that representatives have a significant knowledge gap over the general populace is certainly true for a large majority of the functions of government. However, decisions that could be brought to referendums are the most important issues, ones which we should expect people to know and be informed about.
1.12.6.1.4.1. Con: These important issues are oftentimes of a scope that makes informing oneself and considering the potential consequences next to impossible.
1.12.6.1.4.1.1. Pro: Italy's constitutional referendum in 2016 had unclear implications and has received [various interpretations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/30/italy-referendum-all-you-need-to-know-about-renzis-crunch-vote) as merely a package of legal revisions, as a plebiscite on the prime minister's future, and by some even as a step towards an Italian exit out of the European Union.
1.12.6.1.4.1.2. Pro: At the time of the British decision to leave the European Union in 2016, neither the political details of the Brexit nor its impact on issues like trade, migration and national security were foreseeable for anyone.
1.12.6.1.4.2. Pro: Sometimes, the only information needed by voters is their personal view on the issue and how it affects them directly.
1.12.6.1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.1.3.1.1.1.
1.12.6.1.4.2.2. Con: People's personal views on other decisions \(like same-sex marriage or abortion\) may be ill-informed or poorly thought out, and politicians may have an advantage in this area as well.
1.12.6.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: For example, voters may be more susceptible to [false stories](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/09/carly_fiorina_lied_about_planned_parenthood_video_gop_debate_fact_checking.html) on abortion-related topics.
1.12.6.1.4.2.3. Con: In many cases, even calculating the impact on oneself is difficult - for example, with the Brexit referendum, a huge number of possibilities would have to be computed and evaluated.
1.12.6.1.4.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.6.1.4.1.2.
1.12.6.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.6.
1.12.6.1.4.4. Pro: In addition to becoming informed, referendums also give citizens an incentive to care because they feel that they have a direct say on the outcome.
1.12.6.1.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.9.6.2.
1.12.6.1.4.4.2. Con: -> See 1.9.3.
1.12.6.1.4.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.6.
1.12.6.1.4.4.4. Con: -> See 1.9.2.
1.12.6.1.4.4.5. Pro: When citizens care, they are more likely to criticise their elected representatives when they make poor decisions.
1.12.6.1.5. Pro: The US Congressional Research Service responds to tens of thousands of emails and calls every year and publishes more than a thousand issue-specific reports, many of which aren't publicly accessible \([CRS, p. 2](https://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/about/crs15_annrpt.pdf)\).
1.12.7. Pro: Compared to professional politicians, citizens have a narrow political perspective. As a result, they are often not aware of the consequences their decisions cause.
1.12.7.1. Con: Listening to professional politicians speaking on issues, they too are often closed-minded, seeking only to push their particular views, without considering that they may be wrong.
1.12.7.2. Pro: Compared to large parts of the political elite, citizens are too narrow-minded to look beyond the domestic level and end up neglecting the international perspective. This can harm international relations.
1.12.7.2.1. Pro: After Donald Trump was elected US president on a highly nationalistic platform, his administration has [negatively affected](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/17/rex-tillerson-south-korea-fatigue-denial)  [its relations](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/11/donald-trump-mocked-awkward-handshake-japanese-prime-minister/) [with a number](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-uk-visit-theresa-may-john-bercow-parliament-president-state-a7577126.html) of [important allies](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-times-bild-interviews-angela-merkel-germany-catastophic-mistake-refugees-a7528926.html).
1.12.7.2.2. Con: If voters care more about national than international issues, this is entirely legitimate and should be reflected by their country's politics.
1.12.7.2.2.1. Con: Nationalism harms both a country's own citizens and others in the long run. If a democratic decision is clearly harmful and contrary to the interests and priorities of voters, it should not be implemented.
1.12.7.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.8.3.1.3.1.1.
1.12.7.2.2.2. Pro: It is paternalistic to insist that elites necessarily know more about the moral perspectives that ordinary people should adopt than those people themselves.
1.12.7.2.3. Pro: The rise of [right wing parties](http://time.com/4504010/europe-politics-swing-right/) in Europe indicates that parts of the population strictly think in national perspectives. If asked, those citizens would hinder the process of further international integration.
1.12.7.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.12.7.2.2.
1.12.7.2.3.2. Con: Since 1972, a total of 48 [referendums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendums_related_to_the_European_Union) have been held by EU member states, mainly on the subject of whether to become a member of European Union as part of the accession process, or the ratification of new EU treaties. The grand majority of the outcomes were positive. This shows that the majority of the population supports the European project.
1.12.7.2.3.2.1. Pro: As surveys show, more than half of the European Union's citizens feel attached to the European Union and about 60% to Europe. At least six out of ten support more decision-making power for the EU in various policy areas \([Eurobarometer, p. 4](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/Survey/getSurveyDetail/instruments/STANDARD/surveyKy/2137); [Eurobarometer, p. 119](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/Survey/getSurveyDetail/instruments/SPECIAL/surveyKy/2131)\).
1.12.7.2.3.2.2. Con: New, major events over the past decade \(primarily the handling of the Greek debt crisis, and the existence of the refugee crisis\) have [drastically shifted](https://www.ft.com/content/1740f3a6-2cc2-11e6-bf8d-26294ad519fc) public support for the EU, such that referendum results from decades ago are not proper indicators of public opinion.
1.12.7.2.3.2.3. Con: In numerous instances in European countries, the first vote on an EU treaty resulted in a No, and the second vote, held shortly afterwards, [resulted in a yes.](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2015/10/19/asking-the-public-twice-why-do-voters-change-their-minds-in-second-referendums-on-eu-treaties/)
1.12.7.2.3.2.3.1. Con: The change in vote result was not due to the random whims of the population, but to the renegotiation of [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Agreement_\(1992\)) [aspects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville_Declarations_on_the_Treaty_of_Nice) of the agreement. Thus, the holding of multiple referendums was productive and improved the terms of the ultimate agreement.
1.12.7.2.4. Pro: \(Political\) elites are more enthusiastic about European integration than the general public and thus support the project of European integration more intensively \([Hooghe, p. 18](http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/24618/ssoar-2003-hooghe-europe_divided.pdf?sequence=1)\).
1.12.7.2.4.1. Con: That is merely an over-simplification: The rise of pro-European citizens movements like [Pulse of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_of_Europe) point in a different direction.
1.12.7.3. Pro: Voters tend to look at issues [in isolation](http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21699146-direct-democracy-spreading-across-europe-not-always-good-thing-referendumania) and may approve measures that conflict with each other and lead to incoherent policies.
1.12.7.3.1. Pro: Since they work in government, politicians necessarily possess a more holistic understanding about how various laws and policies fit and work together.
1.12.7.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.4.1.
1.12.7.3.3. Con: It is rare that referendums are sufficiently frequent, and on matters that are sufficiently related, to result in conflicting policies.
1.12.7.3.3.1. Con: Frequent referendums are not needed: the approved measures can conflict with governmental strategies.
1.12.7.4. Con: Politicians are also short sighted as they must always think about reelection.
1.12.7.4.1. Pro: Politicians become more daring when they know that they have nothing to lose because they cannot be reelected.
1.12.7.4.1.1. Pro: President Obama tackled contentious issues such as [gun control](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiesola/2016/01/06/obama-gun-control/#1d783f533f36) and [giving legal status](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/11/19/your-complete-guide-to-obamas-immigration-order/) to a large number of individuals illegally in the US. This shows the substantial influence that concerns about reelection have on policy-making.
1.12.7.4.2. Con: This is exactly why term limits exist in many countries: They enable politicians to put short-term concerns aside in their last term, which is when they can be much more farsighted than voters.
1.12.7.4.2.1. Con: The vast majority of political offices, aside from the very highest ones, have no term limits.
1.12.7.4.2.1.1. Pro: In the United States, no rules prohibit decades-long careers in Congress. The average member of the American senate has been a Senator for over a decade and, before that, sat for half a decade in the House of Representatives \([CRS, p. 4, 11](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41545.pdf)\).
1.12.7.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: The current US Congress has [14 members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_United_States_Congress_by_longevity_of_service) that have been in either Senate or House of Representatives for than 35 years without interruption.
1.12.7.4.2.2. Con: There is nothing to suggest this actually solves the problem. Given that they also hold strong beliefs, these politicians have a strong incentive to ensure that someone with similar views is elected in their place which still encourages short term thinking.
1.12.8. Con: If this were true, the same would count for all kind of elections.
1.12.9. Pro: Societies that require a certain level of money for even basic living standards, while also allowing underpayment of employees and not providing support systems to offset this, lead to overworked citizens with little time or inclination to consider the complexities around referendum questions.
1.12.10. Pro: A significant share of the population doesn't care a bit about politics or policy and is not willing to even spend time to make a well-grounded decision
1.12.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.6.2.1.1.
1.12.11. Pro: -> See 1.12.6.1.
1.12.12. Pro: Voters are chronically misinformed.
1.12.12.1. Pro: Most people [vastly overestimate](https://borgenproject.org/us-foreign-aid-spending/) the percentage of a country's budget devoted to foreign aid.
1.12.12.2. Pro: It is only rational for voters to remain ignorant and uninformed - and this is unlikely to change anytime soon. As individual votes have no chance of swaying decisions and as the costs of becoming informed can be enormous, there is little incentive to do so \([Rauch/Wittes, p. 5](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/more-professionalism-less-populism.pdf)\).
1.12.12.3. Pro: Citizens of Western countries routinely [over-estimate](https://www.theguardian.com/society/datablog/2016/dec/13/europeans-massively-overestimate-muslim-population-poll-shows) the share of Muslims among the population, for example by a factor of 17 in the US and a factor of three in the UK.
1.12.12.4. Pro: Citizens routinely over-estimate the share among the population that finds homosexuality unacceptable, for example in the Netherlands by a factor of seven and in Germany by a factor of four \([Ipsos MORI, s. 10](http://perils.ipsos.com/slides/)\).
1.12.12.5. Pro: Citizens of many countries over-estimate the share of GDP spent on health services by a factor of two to five \([Ipsos MORI, s. 20](http://perils.ipsos.com/slides/)\).
1.12.12.6. Pro: Citizens routinely [over-estimate](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3587/Hearts-and-Minds-misperceptions-and-the-military.aspx) the share of their country's GDP spent on the military, for example in France by a factor of six and in the UK by a factor of 2.
1.12.12.7. Con: There is little reason to assume that politicians' opinions are necessarily more informed than those of average voters.
1.12.12.7.1. Con: -> See 1.12.6.1.
1.12.12.7.2. Pro: Politicians neither pass a special education nor is there a minimal education requirement e.g. in the [USA](http://goingpolitical.com/qualifications-to-be-a-politician/).
1.12.12.7.2.1. Pro: In [New Hampshire](http://www.straighterline.com/blog/should-there-be-a-minimum-education-level-for-politicians/) only 53% of the state legislators have a college-degree.
1.12.12.7.2.1.1. Con: A college degree says little about the competence of a politician, especially if this degree was earned in a field unrelated to political day-to-day activity.
1.12.12.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: Various former and current heads of state have degrees that are probably of little use for their work, for example Angela Merkel's [doctorate in physical chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel#Early_life).
1.12.12.7.2.1.1.2. Con: Irrespective of the field of study, college students learn to deal intensely with complex subject matters and develop a structured working method. This skill set is important for politicians.
1.12.12.7.2.1.1.2.1. Con: These skills can also be obtained in many fields of employment; a college education is not necessarily vital.
1.12.12.7.2.1.1.2.2. Con: It is unclear whether these sorts of abstract skillsets are actually substantially beneficial in terms of making judgement about concrete economic and social questions.
1.12.12.7.2.2. Con: A low level of formal education does not preclude politicians from being well-informed about political issues.
1.12.12.7.2.3. Pro: Politicians are mostly elected based on ideological and emotional appeal, not on actual competence. An assessment of their competence only becomes possible once they are in their elected role.
1.12.12.7.2.3.1. Con: A large portion of this competence assessment happens prior to election day. In order to appear on the ballot, they generally need to get the support of a party machine and subsequently win preselection.
1.12.12.7.3. Con: Politicians are generally required to adhere to the policy position of their party. Their personal opinions, however well-informed, are more often than not irrelevant.
1.12.12.7.4. Con: Between job, family life and other concerns, many voters do not have time to read about political events in detail. For politicians, rather than being an added burden, informing themselves is part of the job they do during normal working hours.
1.12.12.7.4.1. Pro: Studies estimate that citizens spend [only about 15 minutes](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/01/global-newspaper-readership-zenithoptimedia-media-consumption) a day on reading newspapers.
1.12.12.7.4.2. Con: Members of the American Congress usually spend [their full work day](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/01/14/the-most-depressing-graphic-for-members-of-congress/?utm_term=.57776cc35f75) on calling donors, meeting constituents, work in committees and on the floor, and strategic outreach. This leaves little time for them to inform themselves.
1.12.12.7.4.2.1. Pro: Candidates who spend more time campaigning or making connections and less time gathering information are more likely to be reelected, so there is a clear incentive for them to do so.
1.12.12.7.5. Pro: As of last year, [a third](https://thinkprogress.org/most-americans-disagree-with-their-congressional-representative-on-climate-change-95dc0eee7b8f#.ghff9qph6) of the members of the US congress were denying the man-made nature of climate change, against the overwhelming scientific evidence.
1.12.12.7.5.1. Con: A reason for many US politicians' denial of man-made climate change is very [effective lobbying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial#Lobbying) and not the general lack information and knowledge.
1.12.12.7.5.2. Pro: Parts of the Republican Party regard the protection of fossil energy as an [ideological goal](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/why-republicans-still-reject-the-science-of-global-warming-w448023). Therefore, they reject the scientific evidence of man-made global warming.
1.12.12.8. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.1.3.1.1.4.1.
1.12.12.9. Con: If it was true that voters are chronically misinformed, the government's priority should be informing people, not excluding them from decision-making.
1.12.12.9.1. Con: There is no effective and proven strategy for meaningfully improving citizens' level of information, governments have tried and failed in the past. Hence, this is not a realistic alternative to abolishing referendums.
1.12.12.9.1.1. Pro: Education is a commonly solution for political ignorance, yet US American have [remained just as ignorant](http://Education is often named as a solution for political ignorance, yet US American have remained just as ignorant as levels of education improved.) about politics as levels of education improved in the recent past.
1.12.12.9.2. Con: As governments are no disinterested actors they have no incentive to provide fully neutral information.
1.12.12.9.3. Con: -> See 1.12.5.
1.12.13. Con: -> See 1.12.12.7.
1.12.14. Con: Regardless of policy outcomes, the fundamental principle of democracy is not to have those who are best informed decide, but to have everyone participate in the political process on an equal basis.
1.12.14.1. Pro: Some philosophers consider democracy as having an intrinsic value regardless of policy outcomes, since its process embodies the values of [liberty and equality](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democracy/#NonInsVal).
1.12.14.2. Con: Electing representatives does not violate the democratic principle of equality: every citizens' vote counts equal and every citizen has the possibility to become a politician. On top of that, it prevents misinformed citizens from gaining too much influence.
1.12.15. Pro: The content of political subject matters and referendum proposals overburden citizens.
1.12.15.1. Pro: According to surveys, more than half of British voters felt that they did not have enough information about what would happen in case the Brexit referendum of 2016 would result in the UK leaving the EU \([Electoral Commission, p. 46](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/215279/2016-EU-referendum-report.pdf)\).
1.12.15.2. Pro: The issues surrounding the 2016 Italian referendum to amend the Italian constitution was deemed so [complex](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/17/start-up-offers-pricey-non-biased-lessons-to-understand-the-ital/) that a company was charging €145/hr to help explain it to voters.
1.12.15.3. Pro: Citizens with low socio-economic status in particular feel overburdened by complex proposals.
1.12.15.3.1. Pro: In Switzerland citizens with a low level of education, low incomes and in lower status occupations often feel overburdened by complex proposals and as a result, they participate noticeably less \([Linder, p. 6](http://www.wolf-linder.ch/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Strengths-and-weaknesses-of-direct-democracy.pdf)\).
1.12.15.3.2. Pro: Researchers emphasize that in the US a lack of knowledge about parties' political positions especially hinders voters of low socio-economic status to translate their preferences into vote choices \([Fowler/Margolis, p. 100](http://libproxy.snu.ac.kr/9dd806d/_Lib_Proxy_Url/ac.els-cdn.com/S0261379413001522/1-s2.0-S0261379413001522-main.pdf?_tid=908f0174-f5c8-11e6-8861-00000aacb361&acdnat=1487415425_b120ecf41e6e0d050394a9f4693bf967)\).
1.12.16. Pro: Citizens are easily manipulated and controlled.
1.12.16.1. Pro: Politicians often reframe referendum issues into [simplistic, straightforward narratives](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/world/americas/colombia-brexit-referendum-farc-cameron-santos.html?_r=0) which distances voters from the actual policy question and leads to a contest between abstract values or narratives.
1.12.16.2. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.3.6.
1.12.16.3. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.3.2.
1.12.16.4. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.3.7.
1.12.16.5. Con: The vast amount of information available online gives everyone the means to form their own opinions.
1.12.16.5.1. Pro: Online tools such as [FullFact.org](https://fullfact.org) are available for voters to fact-check arguments made by both sides.
1.12.16.5.1.1. Con: Many voters distrust [fact-checking](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/september_2016/voters_don_t_trust_media_fact_checking) sites.
1.12.16.5.1.2. Con: Only a [minority](http://www.npr.org/2016/09/27/495233627/do-fact-checks-matter) of people who are already more politically knowledgeable and interested in politics are actually interested in fact checking politicians' statements.
1.12.16.5.2. Con: The internet is also a perfect platform for manipulation, agitation and spreading false facts.
1.12.16.5.2.1. Pro: Fake news sites have [recently proliferated](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38168281).
1.12.16.5.2.2. Pro: Often, the internet can actually be worse for manipulation as people tend to exist in an online echo chamber without any presence of dissenting opinions.
1.12.16.5.2.3. Pro: Many voters simply [do not know](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/11/23/503129818/study-finds-students-have-dismaying-inability-to-tell-fake-news-from-real) how to assess the credibility of a news source.
1.12.16.5.2.3.1. Con: Better education around assessing credibility on the internet could rectify this problem, without necessitating the abolition of referendums.
1.12.16.5.2.4. Con: People are far more vulnerable to being misled or misinformed in person, since they have no access to information which they can use to measure the accuracy of what they are being told.
1.12.16.5.2.5. Pro: The great amount of information available makes it infeasible for people to assess the credibility of everything that they read online.
1.12.16.5.2.5.1. Con: False or unreliable information can easily be avoided by sticking to simple heuristics - for example, only reading news articles from mainstream, reputable news organisations.
1.12.16.5.2.5.1.1. Con: In the age of social media, most voters do not deliberately seek out specific and reliable media. Instead, what their friends post on [social media](http://www.journalism.org/2015/06/01/facebook-top-source-for-political-news-among-millennials/) becomes a central source of what they consume online.
1.12.16.5.2.5.1.2. Con: Even reputable news organisations tend to lean towards a certain political persuasion. They can distort facts to suit their position.
1.12.16.5.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: Many of the most reputable news sources in the world are still mildly ideological. The Economist is libertarian-ish, the New York Times and The Guardian are centre-left, The Wall Street Journal is centre-right.
1.12.16.5.2.5.2. Con: People only consume a finite quantity of that large amount of information. It is easy to fact-check what few articles you read every day.
1.12.16.5.2.6. Pro: A [Twitter bot army](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2017/01/20/twitter-bot-army/#.WKEqQWWK9d0) of 350.000 fake accounts has been discovered recently. It is used to artificially inflate the number of followers a profile has, send spam and manipulate online sentiment.
1.12.16.6. Pro: In Switzerland an analysis indicates that a part of the voters follow simple propaganda \([Linder, p. 7](http://www.wolf-linder.ch/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Strengths-and-weaknesses-of-direct-democracy.pdf)\).
1.12.16.6.1. Con: The analysis also indicates that the influence of propaganda varies from referendum to referendum and does not have much impact on referendums on so called pre-disposed issues,  where voters apply their own experience, moral convictions and interests \([Linder, p. 7](http://www.wolf-linder.ch/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Strengths-and-weaknesses-of-direct-democracy.pdf)\).
1.12.16.6.2. Con: The analysis also finds that a considerable part of the Swiss population makes good use of the information available to them \([Linder, p. 7](http://www.wolf-linder.ch/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Strengths-and-weaknesses-of-direct-democracy.pdf)\).
1.12.16.7. Con: This is not an argument against referendums as such, but for stricter rules and regulations for the campaigning for referendums, such as a prohibition of fake news that agitate the public.
1.12.16.7.1. Con: Freedom of the press is of great importance for democracies and a fundamental part of their constitutions.
1.12.16.7.1.1. Pro: The [First Amendment](http://www.lincoln.edu/criminaljustice/hr/Speech.htm) to the U.S. Constitution prohibits the Congress to create law that abridges the freedom of speech, or of the press.
1.12.16.7.2. Con: Fake news are only one among many factors through which voters can be manipulated. The vast majority of them cannot be tacked by legal measures.
1.12.16.8. Pro: The [United Kingdom European Union membership referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016) played to fears of [increased immigration](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/voting-details-show-immigration-fears-were-paradoxical-but-decisive) from the Leave camp and fears of an increase in aggressive nationalism from the Remain camp.
1.12.16.8.1. Pro: The Leave campaign frequently employed [false statistics](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/27/uk-statistics-chief-vote-leave-350m-figure-misleading) and [misleading pledges](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-result-nigel-farage-nhs-pledge-disowns-350-million-pounds-a7099906.html) in its campaign.
1.12.17. Con: -> See 1.8.3.1.3.1.1.1.
1.13. Pro: Referendums give more political influence to the media, actors who lack the legitimacy of elected representatives.
1.13.1. Con: In democratic states, political legitimacy is based on [democratic approval](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimacy/). Hence, the media's influence can be seen as legitimate when people read and share their content, i.e. pay a lot of attention to them - this widespread attention is the closest proxy for democratic approval that exists for media.
1.13.1.1. Con: The way the media obtains legitimacy is not compatible with the principle of an equal and general election.
1.13.1.2. Con: Giving democratic legitimacy to profit oriented private companies harms democracy.
1.13.1.2.1. Pro: Unlike governmental institutions, media corporations do not owe accountability to citizens and mainly follow their private interests, to create profits and sell units.
1.13.1.2.2. Con: Media companies that are not able to attract public interest, approval and revenue to at least some extent are unable to prevail.
1.13.1.2.3. Pro: Private companies influence political decisions without the checks and balances of the official political process. This is both inherently undemocratic and democratically illegitimate.
1.13.1.2.3.1. Con: Private actors, too, are held in check by controls such as the rule of law, by state-run oversight and internal structures, for example [supervisory boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisory_board). Compliance with these legal requirements is [one definition](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/legitimate) and source of legitimacy.
1.13.1.3. Pro: Large newspapers are attracting [more and more subscribers](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/04/why-newspaper-subscriptions-are-on-the-rise/) online. This is an indicator of public approval and, by extension, these newspapers' legitimacy.
1.13.1.3.1. Pro: After relying on advertisement in the past, newspapers like The New York Times now make [more than half](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/business/media/new-york-times-q4-earnings.html) of their revenue through circulation and subscriptions.
1.13.1.4. Con: Simple popularity does not legitimate actors to disproportionally influence political processes.
1.13.2. Pro: More influence for the media gives more potential to influence the public discourse to a very small group of companies and individuals that control large parts of the media in most countries.
1.13.2.1. Pro: According to a worldwide study across 30 countries, the top four companies own on average 79% of the media platforms that distribute content and 40% of the media that produces content \([Noam, p. 8](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=kDfuCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Who+Owns+the+World%27s+Media?:+Media+Concentration+and+Ownership+around+the+World&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjb7KGz3eHTAhVDjLwKHZkZDlQQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=Who%20Owns%20the%20World's%20Media%3F%3A%20Media%20Concentration%20and%20Ownership%20around%20the%20World&f=false)\).
1.13.2.1.1. Pro: Large parts of the American media is controlled by only [five large companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_cross-ownership_in_the_United_States#Owners_of_American_media) and a [number of billionaires](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katevinton/2016/06/01/these-15-billionaires-own-americas-news-media-companies/#159590ef660a).
1.13.2.1.1.1. Con: Several of the most prominent newspapers in the US are not owned by large conglomerates, for example [The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times#Ownership), the [Chicago Tribune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune#Zell_ownership_and_bankruptcy) and the [Los Angeles Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times#Ownership).
1.13.2.1.1.2. Con: The largest news agencies active in the United States, such as [Reuters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_Reuters), [Bloomberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News) and [Associated Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press), are not owned by any large media conglomerates.
1.13.2.1.1.3. Con: Several of America's most popular news sites are owned by independent companies, for example [Yahoo](http://www.nasdaq.com/de/symbol/yhoo/ownership-summary) and [MSN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN).
1.13.2.2. Con: The internet makes it easier than ever before to access a wide variety of media, small and large, from near and far.
1.13.2.2.1. Con: Researchers caution that although individuals have more media to choose from, their actual media consumption happens on a select few platforms owned by a handful of companies \([Noam, p. 9](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=kDfuCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Who+Owns+the+World%27s+Media?:+Media+Concentration+and+Ownership+around+the+World&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjb7KGz3eHTAhVDjLwKHZkZDlQQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=Who%20Owns%20the%20World's%20Media%3F%3A%20Media%20Concentration%20and%20Ownership%20around%20the%20World&f=false)\).
1.13.2.2.2. Pro: Due to its diversity of platforms the internet enables the rise of alternative information sources, such as [citizen journalism](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/11/rise-of-citizen-journalism).
1.13.2.2.3. Con: In many countries, Google [absolutely dominates](https://www.statista.com/statistics/220534/googles-share-of-search-market-in-selected-countries/) the market for search engines and thereby has a significant influence on what many people find when they look up political information. The power to decide which of the endless information online people access is therefore highly concentrated.
1.13.2.3. Pro: This is especially stark when it comes to social media, which are an important aggregator of information for many voters. Excluding Chinese platforms, four of the [five largest](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/) social networking services worldwide are owned by Facebook.
1.13.2.3.1. Pro: [Two out of three](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/11/11/social-media-update-2016/) Americans use Facebook - and [two thirds](http://www.journalism.org/2016/05/26/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2016/) of them use the network to get news. For Americans under 50 it is even the [most important](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/archive/mood_of_america_archive/congressional_performance/new_low_only_25_think_their_member_of_congress_deserves_reelection) source of news.
1.13.2.3.1.1. Con: Depending on the country and the survey, these numbers vary significantly. In Germany, only 20% of internet users state that they use social networks to get the news \([Bitcom, p. 5](https://www.bitkom.org/Presse/Anhaenge-an-PIs/2017/02-Februar/Bitkom-Charts-PK-Fake-News-02-02-2017.pdf)\).
1.13.2.3.2. Con: Facebook does not provide content itself but merely provides a platform to share it.
1.13.2.3.2.1. Con: Inside Facebook, the claim that the platform does not play a role in political discourses, is neutral and not an enabler of problems such as fake news, [has been questioned](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/14/technology/facebook-is-said-to-question-its-influence-in-election.html).
1.13.2.3.2.2. Con: The algorithms based on which Facebook presents content to users are [suspected](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/09/how-facebooks-algorithm-could-influence-us-election-result) [to wield](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/10/could-google-influence-presidential-election) potentially significant political influence.
1.13.3. Con: Given that the media is already undergoing a crisis of legitimacy, any added influence they gain is likely going to be marginal.
1.13.3.1. Pro: Across the European Union, citizens in a majority of countries tend to mistrust the print and online media with only the radio being a generally trusted source of information \([EBU, p. 6](https://www.ebu.ch/publications/trust-in-media-2016)\).
1.13.3.2. Pro: In a survey conducted in 28 countries, barely half of the respondents expressed trust in the media \([Edelman, p. 4](https://de.scribd.com/doc/295815519/2016-Edelman-Trust-Barometer-Executive-Summary)\).
1.13.3.3. Pro: [Only a third](http://www.gallup.com/poll/195542/americans-trust-mass-media-sinks-new-low.aspx) of Americans have a great deal or a fair amount of trust in the media. [Even fewer](http://www.people-press.org/2008/08/17/media-credibility/), on average, believe all or most of what the media reports.
1.13.3.4. Con: This crisis of media legitimacy is by no means a universal phenomenon and depends on the perspective one takes.
1.13.3.4.1. Pro: Almost 60% of Germans perceive the German media as trustworthy. Almost 90% rate the media offerings in Germany as good or very good \([WDR, p. 5, 7](http://www1.wdr.de/unternehmen/der-wdr/unternehmen/studie-glaubwuerdigkeit-download-100.pdf)\).
1.13.3.4.2. Pro: Surveys indicate that the majority of the informed public in most countries does actually have trust in the media \([Edelman, p. 5](https://de.scribd.com/doc/295815519/2016-Edelman-Trust-Barometer-Executive-Summary)\).
1.13.4. Con: Citizens are free to ignore the media.
1.13.5. Pro: In referendums, media can directly influence a particular political decision by influencing the electorate. Elections only allow the media to influence the public concerning a nominee or a political party.
1.13.5.1. Con: The media are still directly influencing the votes of the public, and assuming that elected representatives respond to the public will, can control them while they are in power.
1.13.5.2. Pro: According to surveys, about half of British citizens felt that the Brexit referendum of 2016 was "not covered in a fair and balanced way" by the media \([Electoral Commission, p. 48](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/215279/2016-EU-referendum-report.pdf)\).
1.13.6. Con: The media is already extremely influential in modern democracies. Introducing referendums will not add much to that.
1.13.6.1. Con: Among those who do not inform themselves about political events like upcoming elections through the media, [half say](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/04/half-of-those-who-arent-learning-about-the-election-feel-their-vote-doesnt-matter/) their vote does not matter. Referendums might change that perception due to their direct influence and motivate these voters to inform themselves via the media.
1.13.6.2. Con: The media is undergoing a crisis of legitimacy.
1.13.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.3.1.
1.13.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.13.3.2.
1.13.6.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.3.3.
1.13.6.2.4. Con: Additionally, based on the logic that a lack of trust and legitimacy in an actor makes a powerful role of that actor problematic, power should be taken from politicians via referendums. Politicians are in a legitimacy crisis much more severe than the media.
1.13.6.2.4.1. Pro: In the UK, [about 80%](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/02/17/leave-voters-are-less-likely-trust-any-experts-eve/) of the population do not trust what politicians say. The majority does not trust their own representative's talk.
1.13.6.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.1.
1.13.6.2.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.2.
1.13.6.2.4.4. Pro: According to a survey of 28 countries, an average of 41% of citizens trust their government. In three out of four countries, the majority does not trust the government. This level of trust is even lower than that of the media \([Edelman, p. 12, 13](http://www.edelman.com/global-results/)\).
1.13.6.2.5. Con: -> See 1.13.3.4.
1.13.6.3. Pro: For the vast majority of citizens, media and news agencies are the only source of information about political events.
1.13.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.13.2.2.2.
1.13.6.3.2. Pro: Nine out of ten voters learn about events like upcoming elections in a given week through the media, and seven out of ten do so from more than three kinds of media, according to [surveys](http://www.journalism.org/2016/02/04/the-2016-presidential-campaign-a-news-event-thats-hard-to-miss/) in the United States.
1.13.6.4. Con: Your argument suggests media's influence on a referendum would be proportionate to it its influence in the current political process. In a referendum, however, the typical institutions and stakeholders of the democratic process are non-existent or severely muted, and so the media exerts a disproportionate influence on those debates.
1.13.7. Pro: In regular political decision-making, the effects of media bubbles are mitigated by representatives that must cross party lines to pass laws. If decisions are made by voters directly, this bipartisan process is bypassed and the influence of the media is heightened.
1.13.7.1. Con: This is an argument in favor of support and incentives for better journalism and more discussions among citizens, as well as citizens and the government. It is not, however, a general argument against referendums.
1.13.7.2. Con: It is better to have a polarized discussion than no discussion at all.
1.13.7.2.1. Con: Polarization [produces policy gridlock](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/12/22/why-polarization-matters/), degrades public discussion, likely contributes to social and economic inequality, it segregates people of different opinions, undermines trust and thwarts empathy. Given these negative effects that undermine societal coherence and prevent effective policy-making, it would be better to not have the discussion at all.
1.13.7.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.3.
1.13.7.2.2. Con: This assumes that less media influence leads to less public discussion. While this might be true quantitatively, the most relevant public debates happen in parliament, irrespective of the media.
1.13.7.2.3. Pro: A significant characteristic of democracy is the principle and practice of solving differences through dialogue and discussion. The media, and especially social media, are an expression of this principle, as they enable and foster discussion.
1.13.7.3. Pro: According to the [limited‐effects theory](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/sociology/contemporary-mass-media/the-role-and-influence-of-mass-media), people generally decide which content to consume based on what they already believe and thus are trapped in a filter bubble of their own convictions.
1.13.7.4. Pro: This is particularly true for individuals who use social media for news consumption. There is a higher risk of becoming trapped in a "[collective social bubble](http://news.indiana.edu/releases/iu/2015/12/social-media-bubbles.shtml)".
1.13.7.4.1. Pro: According to a Pew Research [report](http://www.journalism.org/2015/06/01/facebook-top-source-for-political-news-among-millennials/), 61% of millennials in the US get their political news on Facebook, as do 51% of Generation X. Facebook feeds are personalized based on past clicks and likes behavior, so without realizing it, users develop tunnel vision and continually reinforce their own biases.
1.13.8. Pro: The media is considered to be a powerful political actor without accountability - and therefore at times referred to as the '[Fourth Estate](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/oct/06/importance-free-press-alan-rusbridger)'.
1.13.8.1. Con: [Unlike politicians](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/oct/06/importance-free-press-alan-rusbridger), the lack of accountability enables the media to act independently. This is beneficial for democracy.
1.13.8.1.1. Pro: Journalists are not restricted by a party book, the fear of reelection, or the need to find compromises with other political actors. Therefore they can address issues freely.
1.13.8.1.1.1. Con: As the media are businesses, they have to earn money and are restricted by that. As a result, they likely publish content that sells best regardless of its relevance for society.
1.13.8.2. Pro: By campaigning for one side and discrediting the other, the \(mass\) media can influence the outcomes of referendums.
1.13.8.2.1. Pro: A study [showed](https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/may/23/study-confirms-that-the-national-press-is-biased-in-favour-of-brexit) that of the articles about Brexit published by the British press, there were two times as many pro-Brexit as pro-Remain articles.
1.13.8.2.2. Con: The mass media already influences elections by supporting one candidate over others.
1.13.8.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.13.5.
1.13.8.2.3. Pro: This is particularly true for [uninformed](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yoani-sanchez/from-information-to-actio_b_8546858.html) citizens as well as those with [low education](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/misinformation-government-campaign-iranian-physicist-assassination/).
1.13.8.2.4. Con: It is possible to regulate the media in such a way so as to limit their advocacy for only one side in a referendum, for example a law could be passed to ensure balance, as currently exists for many state owned media outlets.
1.13.8.2.4.1. Pro: When the Brexit Referendum was announced by the British Government, the BBC drafted its 2016 EU Referendum [Guidelines](https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourbeeb/oliver-daddow/what-are-bbc-guidelines-on-eu-referendum) following a public consultation in order to ensure impartiality of its broadcasts.
1.13.8.2.4.1.1. Con: This is an example of a public broadcaster voluntarily self-imposing a set of standards, not regulation or censorship of the private press.
1.13.8.2.4.2. Con: Regulating the content of the press is an action most liberal democracies would be highly uncomfortable with undertaking, given its totalitarian connotations.
1.13.8.2.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.16.7.1.
1.13.8.2.4.3. Con: In practice, neutrality clauses can prevent media from critically covering both sides of an issue for fear of appearing biased.
1.13.8.2.4.3.1. Pro: The implementation of the BBC's impartiality guidelines has been heavily criticised. For example, many remain supporters accused it of [not properly holding the Leave campaign to account](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/03/bbc-impartiality-skewers-evidence-based-facts) for fear of audiences mistaking critical coverage for bias.
1.13.8.2.5. Con: The media is not a uniform actor but composed of entities with different political leanings, business models and target audiences. Therefore, it does not uniformly promote a certain policy direction.
1.13.8.2.5.1. Con: The diversity of the media landscape does not affect the possibility of the media to influence citizens in general.
1.13.8.2.5.2. Con: Despite some diversity in the political leanings of publications, the demographics of media work can lead to political bias. For example, in the US, of politically aligned journalists, Democrats outnumber Republicans [4-to-1](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/05/06/just-7-percent-of-journalists-are-republicans-thats-far-less-than-even-a-decade-ago/?utm_term=.5f11b3c6cd6a) \(though a majority of journalists identify as political independents\).
1.13.8.2.5.2.1. Con: According to the same data set, two thirds of American journalists associate themselves with neither party.
1.13.8.2.5.3. Pro: Describing the media as one homogenous actor is misleading. There are almost always mainstream media institutions on either side of any referendum.
1.13.8.2.5.3.1. Pro: During the Brexit referendum debates, the two extreme views were illuminated by left leaning Guardian UK in the 'Remain' camp and The Sun Newspaper in the 'Leave' camp. There were even instances, such as with The Times \(Remain\) and The Sunday Times \(Leave\) where newspapers under the same parent company promoted [opposing views](http://www.dc4mf.org/en/content/british-press-split-over-brexit-7878).
1.13.8.2.5.4. Con: Media organisations are often owned by extremely wealthy individuals who have a shared incentive to advocate for a referendum outcome that benefits them but not the majority of the population. Due to their superior resources, they can often crowd out smaller media organisations who do not have the same vested interests.
1.13.8.2.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.2.3.
1.13.8.2.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.13.2.1.1.
1.13.8.2.5.4.3. Con: The internet has made it much easier for small, infant media companies to compete with larger ones, especially if the quality of content of the larger ones is being corrupted by vested interests.
1.13.8.2.5.4.3.1. Con: The internet is also dominated by large media companies. In 2011, [two-thirds of the top 25 websites](http://www.journalism.org/2011/05/09/top-25/) that people in the US use to access news were legacy news organizations.
1.13.8.2.5.4.3.2. Con: Network effects mean that the content of large media organizations spreads much more quickly, as shares and likes compound on each other. Large companies therefore have even more of an ability to dominate small ones.
1.13.8.2.6. Pro: During the Brexit campaign, the British media published a series of [significantly misleading](http://www.clearlypr.co.uk/how-the-media-manipulated-the-brexit-vote/) articles about immigration in favor of the leave camp.
1.13.8.3. Pro: According to the agenda-setting theory, the media is able to determine the subjects the public debates about. Politicians have to react to these topics \([Amodu, Usaini, Ige, p. 4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308120682_The_Media_as_Fourth_Estate_of_the_Realm)\).
1.13.8.3.1. Pro: The media are thus capable of controlling which issues come to a referendum in the first place.
1.13.8.3.2. Con: The relationship between media discussion of a topic and public interest in it is [far more complex](http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/01/how-much-influence-does-the-media-really-have-over-elections-digging-into-the-data/) than simple one-direction causality.
1.13.8.3.2.1. Pro: There is clearly causality in the other direction as well: the media intentionally covers issues which the public has a preexisting interest in, or which the media thinks would interest the public.
1.13.8.3.2.1.1. Pro: Most media companies are private, profit-maximising entities. They are thus incentivised to respond to public interest. They have no incentive to malevolently shape public discussion.
1.13.8.4. Con: Just like regular citizens, the media are subject to legal restrictions - varying by country - such as [anti-defamation laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_defamation_law) or [laws against holocaust denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial), so they are not entirely without accountability.
1.13.8.5. Con: In some countries, the media have established voluntary and collective forms of accountability such as the [German Press Code](https://www.presserat.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Downloads_Dateien/Pressekodex13english_web.pdf). This code serves as a basis for official complaints and creates social pressure to comply with basic ethics rules.
1.13.8.6. Con: By calling out and providing alternatives to bad reporting by other publications, the various entities that constitute the media hold each other accountable.
1.13.8.7. Con: The market holds the media accountable since consumers punish bad reporting or conduct by not paying for the respective publication anymore and turning to higher quality competitors instead.
1.13.8.7.1. Con: Fake news is a [huge business](https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo?utm_term=.woaPOArAB#.qjya8vPv4). During the 2016 US presidential elections young Macedonians were paid to spread fake news about Hilary Clinton and create pro-Trump webpages.
1.13.8.7.2. Con: Readers do not always want to read the truth. Some news agencies [have shifted](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-02-24/holmes-truth-may-not-always-sell/3849254) from investigating the truth, to writing about issues that fit the preferences of their readers.
1.13.8.7.3. Con: Consumers do not seem to punish bad reporting. [In the 2016 US presidential election](http://www.vox.com/2016/11/16/13626318/viral-fake-news-on-facebook), fake news was shared more often and reached a greater number of people.
1.13.8.7.4. Con: -> See 1.12.16.
1.13.8.7.5. Pro: Brand reputation is essential for the success of media companies. They would therefore want to avoid any potential of a scandal which tarnishes their brand.
1.13.8.8. Pro: -> See 1.12.16.5.2.5.
1.13.9. Pro: If referendums establish themselves as a democratic institution and take place repeatedly, this expands the opportunities for the media to influence people's opinions \(and thereby political outcomes\).
1.13.9.1. Con: For most Western democracies there is no clear indication that referendums are habit forming and become part of what voters expect from their democracy \([Butler/Ranney, p. 3](https://books.google.de/books?hl=en&lr=&id=GXV-HFnk_9wC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=referendums+outcomes+higher+legitimacy&ots=JFPear4dgQ&sig=SDXLmYAX0gR1nqoFtcbCleMvwME#v=onepage&q=referendums%20outcomes%20higher%20legitimacy&f=false)\).
1.13.9.2. Pro: While elections typically take place every four or five years, referendums are held three or four times a year in [Switzerland](http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/the-swiss-vote-more-than-any-other-country/8483932).
1.13.10. Con: The media is supposed to play an integral role in democracies.
1.13.10.1. Con: If the ultimate impact of the media playing this central role is negative, the media should not play such a central role in our political decisionmaking processes.
1.13.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.13.6.3.
1.13.10.3. Pro: That the media is commonly referred to as the "[Fourth Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Estate)" indicates that it is meant to keep the other organs of democratic governance in check.
1.14. Con: Referendums are an effective measure to reduce the influence of private interests and lobbying.
1.14.1. Con: The influence of private interests is not intrinsically negative for democracy.
1.14.1.1. Pro: The large number of interest groups aiming at different and often competing goals cause a balancing effect and prevent a single minority from imposing its will on the majority.
1.14.1.1.1. Con: A large number of interest groups with different and competing goals is by no means assured. The dominance of few or even single interests is equally possible.
1.14.1.2. Pro: Private interest groups function as a link between those who govern and those who are governed.
1.14.1.2.1. Pro: Private interest groups inform and consult the government about society members' interests, the needs of the economy, and social, political and environmental grievances.
1.14.1.2.1.1. Pro: As democratic policy decisions are a result of an exchange of those influences, interest groups help to create well-balanced law.
1.14.1.2.2. Con: These links tend to be based on financial resources rather than voter count, giving the richer a disproportionately high influence in government.
1.14.2. Con: The Brexit debate in which their are numerous solid reasons to leave, eg [10 reasons to leave ther EU,](https://www.capitalandconflict.com/brexit/ten-reasons-to-leave-eu/)became reduced to  [3 reasons](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnmauldin/2016/07/05/3-reasons-brits-voted-for-brexit/#24969dd51f9d). These were all influenced by the media campaigns of the Leave camp.
1.14.3. Pro: It is harder to influence millions of individual voters than the small number of politicians that can be sufficient to swing a vote.
1.14.3.1. Pro: Many laws are maintained through lobbying groups which act largely out of the sight of the public, and exclusively target politicians. See [agricultural subsidies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy) in many countries, or[pharmaceutical industry lobbyists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_lobby).
1.14.3.2. Pro: Despite the public lobbying efforts of the NRA, a [vast majority](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-agree-with-obama-that-more-gun-buyers-should-get-background-checks/) of Americans support background checks for gun ownership, yet NRA lobbying which targets politicians has been extremely effective at [blocking legislation](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/20/politics/senate-gun-votes-congress/).
1.14.3.3. Con: Just because there are more of them does not necessarily mean it is harder to influence individual voters. Given the ability of the media to target huge swathes of the population at once, these people can easily be swayed.
1.14.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.16.
1.14.3.3.2. Con: Most people would ignore media articles written by groups with obvious vested interests, so the only medium available to interest groups who want to influence the public is advertisements. Since these are necessarily brief, it is less simple to convey substantial argumentation for the position of the interest group.
1.14.3.3.2.1. Pro: Lobby groups spend vast quantities of money on [advertisements](http://time.com/3668128/lobbying-advertising-public-relations/), most of which are [short TV ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzVrURNdPss&amp;list=UUiCz8w_VYuGxsve-ZdbP8YQ) rather than detailed pitches.
1.14.3.3.2.2. Pro: It is much easier to give a targeted, detailed pitch to a single individual than to try to transmit that information in a digestible format to millions of people.
1.14.3.3.2.3. Con: This assumes that people are good at noticing when an article has evident vested interest. However, if the article reinforces their belief or resonates in some way, they are likely to believe it.
1.14.3.3.2.3.1. Pro: Rather than neutral articles, readers tend to seek out publications that [confirm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) their [existing beliefs](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds).
1.14.3.3.2.3.2. Pro: There are many instances where vested interests can manifest themselves very subtly - for example, when the company with a vested interest is a donor to the news site publishing the article. Vested interests in these cases may be difficult for the average person to detect.
1.14.3.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: American billionaire Robert Mercer [funded](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/us-billionaire-mercer-helped-back-brexit?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other) a Facebook Leave campaign during Brexit which targeted swing voters with highly individualised and subtle advertisements.
1.14.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.14.3.3.2.2.
1.14.4. Pro: When citizens decide about a political issue, back room negotiations between politicians and lobbyists are vastly less influential.
1.14.4.1. Pro: Secrecy allows lobbyists to make direct self-interested appeals to politicians, or invoke other distasteful reasons. These options are not available to them when they must lobby publicly.
1.14.5. Con: Instead of convincing politicians, interest groups can simply relocate their efforts and start campaigns in order to win the masses.
1.14.5.1. Pro: Such misleading referendums can trick voters into supporting apparently innocuous referendums that would have significantly harmful consequences. Politicians, on the other hand, have the time and resources to become informed on each bill, and so are harder to trick.
1.14.5.1.1. Pro: Indeed, false flag referendums are a genuine problem in the US, such as a \(failed\) [Florida measure](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/science/florida-solar-power-referendum.html) that purported to support solar energy proliferation, but would actually have significantly discouraged its uptake.
1.14.5.1.2. Con: The problem is not that politicians are tricked into believing things that are not true, but rather that powerful interest groups often have economic leverage \(e.g. via [campaign donations](http://www.cfinst.org/pdf/papers/02_Powell_Influence.pdf)\) which they can use to influence politicians.
1.14.5.2. Con: -> See 1.14.3.
1.14.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.12.16.
1.14.6. Con: Private interest groups were successfully able to influence the Brexit referendum's outcome according to their preferences.
1.14.6.1. Con: The Brexit referendum was seen as a [repudiation of the influence of elites](http://www.vox.com/2016/6/25/12023532/brexit-rejection-britains-governing-elite), rather than a concession to their desires.
1.14.6.1.1. Con: "Elites" here is conceived broadly as being "educated, higher-income segments of society." It is entirely consistent with this statement to say that certain super-rich individuals or corporations manipulated the result of the vote to suit their interests.
1.14.6.2. Pro: More than half the donations made in the recent [Brexit referendum](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-referendum-donations-ten-wealthy-political-donors-make-up-half-vote-leave-remain-nigel-a7348321.html) campaign came from just ten wealthy donors who framed the debate on either side to suit their own views or business interests.
1.14.6.2.1. Con: It is unlikely that pro-Brexit donations arose from self-interest, given the likely harmful economic consequences of Brexit, particularly for large corporations. It is more likely the donations were ideologically based, and it does not seem clear that ideologically motivated donations are wrong or undesirable.
1.14.6.2.1.1. Con: Even if the donations were ideologically based, it is harmful and unjust that the wealthy can have their opinions disproportionately represented through large donations.
1.14.6.2.1.2. Con: Theoretically speaking, it is not impossible that corporations and therefore wealthy individuals could stand to gain financially from Brexit. For example, if Brexit results in more protectionist measures and therefore an advantage for domestic companies over foreign ones in domestic markets, then companies whose revenue and production are largely domestic could stand to gain.
1.14.6.2.1.3. Pro: A pro-Brexit donor's company's market value [dropped 400 million pounds](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-referendum-donations-ten-wealthy-political-donors-make-up-half-vote-leave-remain-nigel-a7348321.html) immediately after the referendum \(though it later returned to normal\).
1.14.6.3. Con: There was a correlation between higher income and voting in favor of remaining in the EU. If the wealthy and educated would have in fact been able to manipulate the referendum, it should have never taken place or not resulted in a Brexit. After all, the elites apparently opposed this outcome \([CSJ, p. 2](http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/core/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/LEGJ4799_Brexit_report_0916_WEB.pdf)\).
1.14.7. Pro: Politicians are more responsive to direct incentives, for example to [campaign donations from lobbyists](https://www.publicintegrity.org/2006/01/18/6546/lobbying-faq).
