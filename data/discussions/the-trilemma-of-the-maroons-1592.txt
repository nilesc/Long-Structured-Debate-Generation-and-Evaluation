Discussion Title: The Trilemma of the Maroons

1. The Trilemma of the Maroons.
1.1. Option "One":
Agree and then honor the agreement. Become the slave police.
1.1.1. Pro: We will be the more humane slave police.
1.1.1.1. Pro: We can do it as honorably as it can be done, which is a lot better way to live \(and lead and raise our children\) than being dead or a cheat.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: If we are the slave police we have greater discretion in implementing the policy, such as choosing between life and death.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: If we are met with resistance or violence during capture, we may have no choice but to respond in a matter that causes harm to them to avoid harm coming to us. Thus, mistreatment may be inevitable depending on the circumstances.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: We are less prone to maltreat slaves as we can empathise with them in ways the British cannot.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: From the British perspective this might make us worse at being the slave police as our work would have less of a deterrent effect on slaves who consider escaping.
1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: It is not our obligation to calculate out the benefits of the agreement to the British. If they are unhappy with our interpretation, they can revisit the agreement. But until that time, we need not consider whether our implementation is satisfactory or not.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: While it is not our obligation to care about the British response, it is in fact in our interest. If they are unhappy and decide to kill us, then that is an undesirable outcome.
1.1.1.1.4. Con: It is highly likely that the returned slaves face severe punishment or even death. How they are treated prior to their return thus makes not much of a difference.
1.1.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.
1.1.2. Con: By supporting the British, we would help prop up a regime that is cruel to a large portion of the population.
1.1.2.1. Pro: We are living in the mountains, an area that is difficult to control by the British. Our support is essential for achieving full territorial coverage.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: As a result, the British would be vastly less effective without us. In this way, we in fact make the regime even worse.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: The plan here is only to work with the British to the minimum extent required. Thus, we are minimizing any future harm also.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: However, this still has the optics of us supporting the British which makes them look stronger than they necessarily are. Any potential resistance might be dissuaded by this apparent strength.
1.1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: The British forces look insurmountable already. Marginal increases are unlikely to matter.
1.1.2.2. Pro: If slavery were abolished \(or the British left\) this would leave us in a position where we would likely face the resentment and possibly attacks of the previous slaves.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: It would be easy for us to blend in with newly freed slaves.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: If we help them overthrowing the British we will be seen as partners.
1.1.2.2.3. Con: We can probably explain to the other Maroons the choice we had. Given their dealings with the British, it is likely that they would be sympathetic to our choice.
1.1.2.2.3.1. Con: Explaining other Maroons the choice we had is a risk in itself. The British will surely watch us closely and might also have agreements with other Maroons to spy on us.
1.1.2.2.3.2. Pro: Given that the British are enslaving them, the slaves are unlikely to think positively of the British.
1.1.2.2.3.3. Pro: The other slaves are likely to realise that faced with a similar choice, they would also choose survival.
1.1.2.2.4. Con: In Haiti those who collaborated turned out to be the leaders of the independent state \([Blackburn, p. 243](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=JndLInWWjx4C&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=slaves+overthrow+plantation&source=bl&ots=PicqvOeb9y&sig=8_-M9_XdpYfTQo-SRWp37f-InnI&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQr9HSgcbRAhWImpQKHcVdBn8Q6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&q=collaborators&f=false)\).
1.1.2.3. Con: Our continued existence and independence is a proof of British weakness as we survived after confronting them.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: [Integrity](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/integrity/) is a moral value that sometimes requires us to take a more active stance against evil than merely minimizing it.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: It is unclear why seeing a group which hates the British instead working with them will make the British look weak. If anything, it will make them look strong as they can subjugate even their strongest foes. The British can frame this as a sign of strength.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: The British are shown to be unable to dominate the interior of the island without our help.
1.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: The British have shown that they do not only have military but also diplomatic persuasive force.
1.1.2.3.3. Pro: This demonstrates that the British cannot be completely successful in their slave endeavors without assistance from us.
1.1.2.3.4. Con: Even if we are highlighting British weakness, we are doing it through cooperation. Other groups are less likely to resist in that case, but also try to cooperate.
1.1.2.3.4.1. Con: Even if we die our example will inspire other slaves to follow in our footsteps.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1. Pro: Our example provides learning effects that makes future resistance easier.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.1. Con: These learning effects could be of a deterring nature and convince others that resistance is futile.
1.1.2.3.4.1.2. Pro: The knowledge that we died a quick death and did not suffer a worse fate, for example torture, will relieve the anxieties of others.
1.1.2.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: Uncertainty about the cruelty of an execution might be more effective in preventing rebellion than just to know they are going to die. Knowing that one is not going to be tortured makes death a punishment to fear less.
1.1.2.3.4.1.3. Pro: It is conceivable that so far no one ever thought of the possibility to rebel.
1.1.2.3.4.1.4. Con: This assumes that other slaves actually know about our rebellion. They alternatively might believe - or be told by the British - that we were killed without ever being given a choice or the chance to rebel.
1.1.2.3.4.1.5. Pro: In the Barbados Rebellion of 1816 a small group of rebels were joined by slaves from around 70 plantations \([NLJ, p.5](http://www.nlj.gov.jm/history-notes/The%20Emancipation%20Wars.pdf)\).
1.1.2.4. Pro: Due to our support, the chances that runaway slaves are returned are greater. This will make slave ownership more appealing and financially rewarding.
1.1.2.4.1. Con: The costs of runaway slaves are already built into slavery and it is lucrative nevertheless. Our impact is likely not bigger than that of a bad season.
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: This may make it less likely that slave owners will use lethal force to prevent an escape.
1.1.2.4.2.1. Con: Brutal and often lethal force is a [common form of punishment](http://abolition.e2bn.org/slavery_69.html) for many infractions on a plantation. There is no reason to expect that our cooperation will change this fact.
1.1.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: This is because there would still be a strong desire to provide a disincentive to slaves from running away. This is true regardless of whether the owners are likely to get the slaves back.
1.1.2.4.2.1.2. Pro: Slave owners used brutal punishments, such as whipping, mutilation, dragging and branding as a way to assert their [dominance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_of_slaves_in_the_United_States), discouraging future escapes.
1.1.2.4.2.1.3. Pro: Bad treatment, to some extent, can increase productivity.
1.1.2.4.3. Pro: The reduced chances of success deters escape attempts. This frees resources on preventing escapes and makes owners better off.
1.1.2.4.4. Pro: Slavery is an unjust institution. What is regarded as a harm to a slaveowner should be regarded as a good to anyone who wants to end the practice of slavery.
1.1.2.4.4.1. Pro: This is especially true when we are part of a group who have been enslaved in the past. It is dangerous to prop up the slave trade when it could be subjected upon us once more.
1.1.2.5. Con: It is likely that if we do not agree and abide by the agreement the next group of Maroons will be offered it as well. So nothing is gained by us refusing to become the slave police.
1.1.2.5.1. Con: This assumes that other groups of slaves will have the same chance. Regardless of whether we reject the deal or cheat on it, the British are unlikely to offer the same deal if it does not benefit them \(due to our rejection or cheating\).
1.1.2.5.2. Pro: If the next group accepts the slave police will still exist; it just wont be us because we will be dead.
1.1.2.5.3. Pro: The next group of Maroons are likely to honor the agreement as they will also want to save their community.
1.1.2.6. Pro: In becoming the slave police, we will raise our children in a system which does not call out injustice. They will become socialised into thinking that a society which is built around slavery is normal.
1.1.2.6.1. Pro: When our children see us collaborating with the British, they are likely to internalise the norm of slavery. They would be unlikely to fight against it in the future as they have grown up around it.
1.1.2.6.1.1. Pro: This is especially true if we find ourselves in a position of privilege due to slavery. It will become harder to fight against it when we directly benefit from it.
1.1.2.6.2. Con: Even though we might acquiesce with this arrangement in terms of our behavior, our thoughts and speech can oppose it. We can therefore teach our children that this deal is an injustice that we would oppose if only we could.
1.1.2.6.2.1. Pro: Slavery may limit slaves' physical freedoms, yet it does not necessarily limit their mental freedom. As opponents of the Nazi regime in Germany sung: "[Die Gedanken sind frei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Gedanken_sind_frei)" \[the thoughts are free\].
1.1.2.6.2.1.1. Con: The material condition under which we live will not be easy to overcome and affect our perception and thinking, as, for example, Karl Marx famously [argued](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/ch03.htm).
1.1.2.6.2.1.2. Con: We are forced into a [habitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitus_\(sociology\)) which reflects on our thoughts.
1.1.2.6.2.1.3. Pro: This theory of mental freedom that persists even in enslavement is supported by the philosophy of [Stoicism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/).
1.1.2.6.2.2. Con: We cannot oppose slavery to our children in the presence of the British. This is likely to be seen as a form of 'mental rebellion' and will subject ourselves and our children to harm, such as being whipped into submission.
1.1.2.6.2.2.1. Con: The British promised to let us live free in the mountains. Hence, they will not be close enough to our community to notice these acts of 'mental rebellion'.
1.1.2.6.2.3. Con: Regardless of what we teach our children, the fact that they see us collaborating with the British is likely to be the strongest influence upon them.
1.1.2.6.3. Con: Our survival is more important than any higher cause, even the fight against slavery.
1.1.2.6.4. Con: Children are few and mortality rates high. This makes the socialization of our children into slavery less significant than if there would be more children.
1.1.2.6.4.1. Pro: Fertility rates of slave societies were quite low in general \([Black, p. 30](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=NMsqBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=fertility+rate+and+slave+trade&source=bl&ots=au6qGWpGta&sig=aEra7kSRayDxgVM1ILetEGGunYk&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVo6_79obRAhUGVbwKHaa1AikQ6AEIXTAJ#v=onepage&q=fertility%20rate%20and%20slave%20trade&f=false)\).
1.1.2.6.4.2. Con: Even if there are only a few children, they still represent the future of our community. So it is still critical to consider how they are likely to be brought up
1.1.2.6.4.3. Pro: Many children will die of tropical diseases.
1.1.2.7. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.
1.1.3. Pro: Agree and do what is necessary to survive. When the British impose their cultural practices upon you, appropriate them. When the British introduce the sport of cricket to you, make yourself so good that centuries later your cricket team will terrify and embarrass your old colonial masters in England. History will forever hold your cricket team as the best ever and you will have shown the world how a once small, downtrodden nation can ascend greatness! [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indian_cricket_team_in_England_in_1984)
1.1.4. Pro: We would become more powerful if we agree and gain more control over our circumstances.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The alternatives to accepting the British deal would certainly not equip us with more power in the long run. Either we would be dead or cheat on the British and live in permanent fear of them discovering our treason.
1.1.4.2. Con: Increases to our strength are marginal at best given our position of inferiority.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: Even marginal increases in power are beneficial.
1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Marginal improvements in defense structures allows more weak members of society to escape in case our community is attacked.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: Some people in the tribe will benefit, e.g. some people will be tasked with returning slaves or strengthening defensive positions.
1.1.4.2.3. Pro: Militarization is unlikely to be of much use against a military world power like the British.
1.1.4.2.3.1. Pro: The British have a practically unlimited supply of advanced weapons and ammunition. We, in contrast to that, will have a hard time procuring either of them.
1.1.4.2.3.2. Con: The ability of the British to project power against us is highly limited. This mediates Britain's status as global military power.
1.1.4.2.3.2.1. Pro: The British might have trouble in other parts of their empire and not be able to reinforce soldiers on our island.
1.1.4.2.3.2.2. Pro: Our island is relatively far away from London making communication and troop logistics fairly difficult.
1.1.4.2.3.2.3. Pro: We are living in the mountains. These are hard to reach for the British.
1.1.4.2.3.2.4. Pro: Britain does not have many soldiers garrisoned on our island.
1.1.4.2.3.2.4.1. Pro: There is no substantial population that requires guarding nor allows for recruiting of a native colonial force.
1.1.4.2.3.2.4.2. Pro: The only mission is to guard the slaves rather than to establish a change in social order.
1.1.4.2.3.2.4.2.1. Pro: Similar guarding missions, such as those in [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_forces_of_Australia#British_garrison), were staffed with not more than several hundred soldiers.
1.1.4.2.3.3. Con: We may not have access to the same kinds of military weaponry as the British. Even so, enhancing what we have now is likely to be more beneficial to us in the long run than nothing at all.
1.1.4.2.3.3.1. Con: The British will likely notice and preemptively strike against any attempts at militarization on our side.
1.1.4.2.3.3.1.1. Con: A preemptive strike would be the end of the agreement. This would jeopardize the benefits it brought to the British; they will therefore consider these before striking preemptively.
1.1.4.2.4. Pro: While the deal might give us power in the short run, it might have negative side-effects that limit our power in the long run.
1.1.4.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.4.2.4.2. Pro: This act would create a divide between our community and other slaves.
1.1.4.2.4.2.1. Pro: Maroon communities may develop as newly-escaped slaves find shelter in areas where neither the British or us can find them. These communities would likely see us as enemies.
1.1.4.2.4.2.2. Pro: The arrangement would encourage immoral acts in our community, for example encouraging slaves to escape only to return them for profit. Morally, we will be on a slippery slope.
1.1.4.2.4.2.2.1. Con: It seems unlikely that slaves would agree to do this given they would be punished harshly upon return. This is especially likely as they would quickly catch on to the fact that they are not actually being offered freedom and refuse to go with us.
1.1.4.2.4.2.2.2. Pro: This kind of moral hazard would make it very difficult for us to continue fighting against slavery into the future as we would tie our financial success to slavery. This would perpetuate the institution of slavery into the future.
1.1.4.2.4.2.3. Pro: Returned slaves would most likely inform other slaves about our policing. This would disincentivise them from escaping or resisting as the prospects for success would be even smaller.
1.1.4.2.4.2.4. Pro: Future escaped slaves will not trust us, which might result in violent behavior against our community.
1.1.4.2.4.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.1.4.2.5. Pro: This power exists only within the tight confines dictated by the British. It does not allow for any kind of self-determination and thus is the mere illusion of power.
1.1.4.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.
1.1.4.2.5.2. Pro: By considering the power that we would gain by accepting the British deal, we are already playing into their hands as we focus on the power we can yield over those who are even weaker instead of asking who wields power over us.
1.1.4.3. Pro: Over time we can enhance our defenses and military might.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.3.3.1.
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: We can buy weapons and gunpowder or other products we cannot produce on our own.
1.1.4.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.3.
1.1.4.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.3.3.1.
1.1.4.3.3. Pro: Living in mountainous territory allows us to become familiar with the area and helps us to identify potential locations for hideouts, traps or tunnels.
1.1.4.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.3.
1.1.4.4. Pro: We enhance our power within the social hierarchy of the colony.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: Plantation owners will value our services. This will potentially benefit our community later.
1.1.4.4.1.1. Con: However, they will see us merely as tools for the British and thus it is ultimately the British that they will thank.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: These two things are not mutually exclusive. It is possible for them to largely see us as tools for the British while also understanding that without our efforts, it would not be possible to return slaves.
1.1.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: Plantation owners know that the British effectively forced us into this deal and therefore they will credit the British with any benefits they receive.
1.1.4.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: In many colonies, such as [Jamaica](http://www.discoveringbristol.org.uk/slavery/people-involved/traders-merchants-planters/caribbean-plantation-development/plantation-owners/), plantation owners who resided on the island were required to take part in local government. As a result, they are aware of the details of the deal.
1.1.4.4.1.2. Con: We should not care how plantation owners regard us.
1.1.4.4.1.2.1. Con: If the plantation owners are more amenable to us, they may engage with us favourably in the future, potentially benefiting our community as a whole.
1.1.4.4.1.2.2. Con: If we do not care about plantation owners they may pressure the British to kill us/deprive us of our freedom.
1.1.4.4.1.2.3. Pro: Plantation owners were our former masters and did harm to us.
1.1.4.4.1.3. Pro: In the long-term, our service will help increase plantation profits by supplying more workers and reducing the amount of labor lost. This is of high value to the plantation owners.
1.1.4.4.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.2.1.
1.1.4.4.2. Con: We might gain a bad reputation beyond other slaves in the colony as a whole as well as those who sell out to their enemies and turn against their brethren, thus becoming moral outcasts.
1.1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Other observers, such as traders, are perhaps not aware of the the coercive nature of the deal. They will see it as a sign of untrustworthiness that we are selling out our folks.
1.1.4.4.2.2. Pro: White traders do already disregard black people as [racially inferior](http://discoveringbristol.org.uk/slavery/after-slavery/wider-world/black-white-in-britain/racist-ideas/). Adding to this that we are traitors is likely to make them more suspicious.
1.1.4.4.2.3. Con: Traders will deal with us not because they like us but because they want to make profit.
1.1.4.4.3. Pro: We will establish trading relationships with other actors in the colony.
1.1.4.4.3.1. Con: Looking at our situation, it is unlikely that we will be able to gather or produce much that we can actually trade with.
1.1.4.4.3.1.1. Con: With the reward we receive for returning slaves we can buy products.
1.1.4.4.3.2. Con: Any such trade will be at the mercy of the British.
1.1.4.4.3.2.1. Con: The Caribbean is filled with smugglers and pirates willing to circumvent the British to make contact with us.
1.1.4.5. Pro: We gain strength from having power over life and death.
1.1.4.5.1. Pro: Having powers over others causes positive psychological effects.
1.1.4.5.1.1. Pro: Those equipped with power are more efficient in [executive functions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18466404). These are needed to administer our community the best way possible.
1.1.4.5.1.1.1. Con: Having power creates [illusory control](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/11639/illusory_control.pdf) over outcomes that are beyond the individual's reach. Thus, our judgement suffers from overconfidence.
1.1.4.5.1.1.2. Con: The [study linked here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18466404) establishes a connection between power and efficiency in the context of doing one and the same task \(p. 442\). In the situation given here, on the other hand, it is not clear whether power over other slaves would translate into more efficient leadership within the Maroon community.
1.1.4.5.1.2. Pro: There are emotional benefits for those who feel powerful, for example when [power-posing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20855902) or being a senior [civil servant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1674771).
1.1.4.5.1.3. Pro: Enhanced power can lead to higher [aggression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19818043). This is beneficial for a community ready to fight.
1.1.4.5.1.3.1. Con: In our situation, this might equally backfire as aggression might lead to provocations - and thus to a violent response from a more powerful enemy.
1.1.4.5.1.3.2. Con: In a community like ours that is highly dependent on each member, a higher level of aggression might equally lead to internal discord and weaken the group as a whole.
1.1.4.5.1.4. Con: Power can increase [egocentricity](http://faculty.london.edu/einesi/assets/documents/Galinsky_Magee_Inesi_Gruenfeld_2006\(1\).pdf). This is to the disadvantage of us as we need to pay attention to our enemy's moves.
1.1.4.5.1.5. Pro: With increases in power comes an ability to [objectify](http://faculty.london.edu/einesi/assets/documents/Gruenfeld_Inesi_Magee_Galinsky_2008.pdf) other humans. This reduces our pity with the British once we are in a situation to kill them.
1.1.4.5.1.5.1. Con: It is not clear whether reduced pity for one group of people \(here: other slaves\) translates into reduced pity for another group of people \(here: the British\).
1.1.4.5.1.6. Con: Power creates stress for those who decide over life and death of runaway slaves as their decisions will be closely monitored by the rest of the community.
1.1.4.5.1.7. Con: As power is tempting some in our community might seek to get more control over other aspects even they do not merit these positions, such as defense or food distribution.
1.1.4.5.1.8. Con: Having power makes us less likely to accept [opinions](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550614566857) of others. This is a critical weakness as it neglects knowledge resources in our community.
1.1.4.5.2. Pro: Knowing that we treat escaped slaves better than the British - even though we don't have to - allows us to differentiate ourselves from the British and bond over it.
1.1.4.5.3. Con: This power is unconscionable when it comes at the cost of others' lives.
1.1.4.5.3.1. Con: Power does not need to be conscionable to be useful.
1.1.4.5.4. Con: The British still regard the runaway slaves as their property and will not look fondly upon us appropriating or exploiting their property. Exercising this power is thus dangerous.
1.1.4.5.5. Con: This drives a wedge into the community of former and current slaves and creates a two-class society of those who have power and those who live at their mercy. This hurts both the social climate of our community and the anti-slavery struggle.
1.1.4.5.5.1. Con: We do not need to care about fellow Maroons opinion as we will need to exploit them, too, in order to launch a successful guerrilla battle for survival.
1.1.4.5.5.1.1. Pro: Successful guerrilla warfare entails raiding plantations, killing settlers and cattle, abducting slaves and setting fire to cane fields. This will hurt fellow Maroons as well.
1.1.4.5.5.1.2. Con: A split community is unlikely to benefit any attempt at guerrilla warfare.
1.1.4.5.5.1.3. Con: Collaboration with other Maroons would likely be more effective than exploitation.
1.1.4.6. Pro: Becoming the slave police will create new income for us because of the bounty for returning runaway slaves.
1.1.4.6.1. Con: We have no need for money as we are living independently in the mountains.
1.1.4.6.1.1. Con: With money we can buy things we cannot produce.
1.1.4.6.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.3.
1.1.4.6.2. Con: Two pounds for each returned slave translates into roughly [150 pounds](http://inflation.stephenmorley.org/) today. Thus, the income is not substantial.
1.1.4.6.2.1. Con: This would be a significant source of income in an impoverished community.
1.1.4.6.2.2. Pro: It would presumably also require a reasonable amount of resources to catch each slave thus diminishing the value of the bounty further.
1.1.4.6.3. Pro: As Maroons who are under the thumb of the British, this additional income could be incredibly important for members of our community as the foundation of our future livelihood.
1.1.4.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.
1.1.4.6.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.4.2.2.
1.1.4.7. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.2.
1.1.4.8. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.4.2.4.
1.1.4.9. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.4.
1.1.4.10. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.5.
1.1.5. Con: To collaborate with injustice is to bear some of the responsibility for it. This is not worth doing, even on pain of death.
1.1.5.1. Pro: As Socrates argues in the [Crito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crito), it is worse to have one's soul corrupted than to die.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: This is a matter of some philosophical debate. There would be a large number of our community who would prefer to live regardless of how it might affect their soul.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: There are some things worth dying for. Liberty is one such thing.
1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: Accepting the British proposal would ensure almost complete liberty for our community.
1.1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: Accepting a proposal from our enemy does not ensure anything for our community but being under the constraints of the British. This is not liberty.
1.1.5.1.2.1.2. Con: We will not be free to return to our homelands in Africa.
1.1.5.1.2.2. Con: No liberty is created or preserved by dying. This would not be a death in favor of liberty therefore.
1.1.5.1.2.2.1. Con: The liberty to determine the course of one's life \(and death\) is preserved by saying no to the British demands. They, after all, are trying to exert total control over us.
1.1.5.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Our decision to die would emphasize to the British that, ultimately, they cannot gain total control over us. This would strengthen our position, or at least that of our brethren who are still alive.
1.1.5.2. Con: This is the only way to stay alive. Principal responsibility lies with the British, who are forcing us into this agreement under the threat of death.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: Full collaboration is not the only way to stay alive. Cheating, after all, is an option.
1.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Given that this option exists, we would therefore be morally complicit for our actions as we chose to pursue a life as the slave police despite the alternatives.
1.1.5.2.1.2. Con: On a balance of risks, full collaboration is much more likely to lead to our survival in the long run.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Regardless of the difficulty of the alternatives that were offered, this confers moral complicity as these actions directly contribute to others' suffering.
1.1.6. Pro: Our primary duty is to ensure the survival of our community members.
1.1.6.1. Con: By considering our community as encompassing only the Maroons, not all current and former slaves, we are ignoring our brethren still in the hands of the British.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: While it is true that we have shared interests with other slaves, the simple fact is that we do not speak for them. As leaders of a particular set of Maroons, we need to prioritise our Maroons over others.
1.1.6.1.2. Con: The slave community is highly diverse given the different regions of Africa from where we were imported. There is no common bond among slaves.
1.1.6.1.2.1. Con: Independent of our origin, we face the same situation and a common enemy. This provides us with plenty to form a bond.
1.1.6.1.2.2. Con: Irrespective of where we all came from, our common experiences in Jamaica quickly lead to common cultural bonds. Indeed, the process of [creolization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creolization) predates our plight.
1.1.6.1.2.3. Con: Even if there is no bond between us, it is more effective to act as one united group because we can more effectively band together against the British in this way.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Complying with the demands of the British is the most likely option to ensure the safety of every community member.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: It is conceivable that the British will just kill us after we surrender to the agreement.
1.1.6.2.1.1. Con: Under this agreement, our assistance in capturing runaway slaves is too valuable for the British to not honor their word.
1.1.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: This is proved by the fact that they made the agreement with us in the first place.
1.1.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con: While it might be beneficial for them in the short term, the British are not reliant on the agreement and can always break it if it seems more beneficial.
1.1.6.2.1.1.2. Con: The British do not value our lives or the services we can provide, otherwise our death would not be an option.
1.1.6.2.1.1.2.1. Con: If we do not cooperate we do harm the British. This gives our lives value in their perspective.
1.1.6.2.1.1.3. Pro: We are the more effective slave police.
1.1.6.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Because of our history and our links to the slave community, we are more likely to know where escaped slaves have gone which means we will be more effective at capturing them than the British would be.
1.1.6.2.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: If the British saw that we were more effective than them at this, they would be likely to respect us more because they can see our skills.
1.1.6.2.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The British also have seen our skills working on farms, yet this did not increase their respect for us.
1.1.6.2.1.1.3.2. Con: The British are better equipped for this job, for example because they can rely on horses and bloodhounds to trace, hunt and capture escaped slaves.
1.1.6.2.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Runaway slaves are likely to hide out in the mountains given our successful example. There, horses and bloodhounds are less effective.
1.1.6.2.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: While horses may not be helpful in the mountains, bloodhounds are well-equipped for tracking and hunting in rough terrain. Therefore, hiding from the British in the mountains may not be effective.
1.1.6.2.1.1.3.2.2. Con: Tropical illnesses pose a significant threat to the British in the mountains.
1.1.6.2.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.6.2.1.1.5. Pro: We bear the costs of being the slave police in inaccessible territory instead of the British.
1.1.6.2.1.1.5.1. Pro: There are many diseases endemic to tropical jungles, such as malaria.
1.1.6.2.1.2. Pro: The British punished escaped slaves who were caught with horrible torture to act as a deterrent for other slaves. There is no indication that they will act differently since we are classified as runaway slaves as well.
1.1.6.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.1.2.
1.1.6.2.1.3. Pro: The British military will be pressured by plantation owners not to let us have a peaceful life as this would weaken their deterrence.
1.1.6.2.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.
1.1.6.2.1.4. Con: It is unclear why this is worse than accepting death when first presented with the option by the British. Given that we would die in both cases, it isn't worth considering that risk when deciding what to do.
1.1.6.2.1.4.1. Con: It would add an element of deceit to our deaths. Dying with pride and for a cause is arguably better than a death involving duplicity.
1.1.6.2.1.5. Con: The fact that the British offered us the agreement in the first place suggests this is probably not the case. They had the means to kill us on the spot if they wanted to.
1.1.6.2.1.5.1. Con: The British calculus might be that it would be easier to kill us once we put down our weapons and do not expect an attack on our lives.
1.1.6.3. Con: Our community would not like living in the mountains.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: Nevertheless, being constrained to this environment is better than the alternative: death.
1.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: Our only choice is between death and living in the mountains. We should choose to live while we can and look to improve our situation in the future.
1.1.6.3.2. Pro: With no access to the coast, we will be cut off from the outside world.
1.1.6.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.3.
1.1.6.4. Con: Living with the moral weight of our decision to serve the British slavers may be more injurious to our health and happiness than risking war with the British again.
1.1.7. Pro: No deals are permanent. Accepting and abiding by this deal now is a way of strengthening our position during later interactions with the British.
1.1.7.1. Con: Even though the deal might not be permanent, it might have long-lasting negative externalities.
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.4.2.
1.1.7.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.7.1.3. Con: While our decision may cause negative externalities for other people, this is not a consideration we need to consider as all of our lives will be saved.
1.1.7.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Every future option is better than to stand and fight now.
1.1.7.3. Con: Once our society and economy adapts to this role, there will be a process of positive feedback that will make it difficult for us to change the deal later.
1.1.7.3.1. Con: In contrast, the deal might also result in increasing dissatisfaction and moral outrage once our community sees the nastiness of what it agreed to do, leading to calls for a change of the situation.
1.1.7.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.6.
1.1.7.4. Con: The nature of the deal being an ultimatum makes it unlikely that it contains provisions that would allow our community to grow stronger.
1.1.7.4.1. Con: Benefits for our community might be an unintended side-effect of what the British propose.
1.1.7.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.
1.1.7.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.
1.1.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.1.8. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.4.2.
1.1.9. Pro: By accepting the agreement we are proving to the British that we are people who can be reasoned with and will thus at some point be accepted as their equals.
1.1.9.1. Con: We will not gain equal rights as the British will give us our complete freedom only in the mountains.
1.1.9.1.1. Con: This may well be a gradual transition. Freedom in the mountains is at least an improvement on our previous position. It is fair to assume we would be granted even more freedom in the future.
1.1.9.1.1.1. Con: This is only likely to be the case if we continue to treat with the British in good faith. If we were to break this contract, they would certainly not grant us this additional freedom.
1.1.9.1.1.2. Con: The British have no interest in granting us greater freedom.
1.1.9.1.1.2.1. Pro: Granting us greater freedom will enhance the potential damage that could be done by cheating.
1.1.9.1.1.2.2. Con: Greater freedom can look like access to more land, or better supplies with which to survive. It is probable for the British to grant these types of freedoms, as they help us in our efforts to capture runaway slaves by helping us stay alive.
1.1.9.2. Con: If we violate the terms of the agreement later this will enhance the distrust of the British for us and will not make us respectable in their eyes.
1.1.9.2.1. Pro: Cheating on the deal makes it unlikely that the British will enter into agreements with other tribes in the future as they will assume they would also break it. Instead, they would resort to just killing them.
1.1.9.2.2. Con: The British are most likely aware that the rejection of their proposal is more due to unwillingness than due to inability. Our rejection will most likely not lead them to the conclusion that we cannot be reasoned with in principle.
1.1.9.2.2.1. Con: This only makes it more likely that they would never deal with us again in the future.
1.1.9.2.2.2. Pro: The British will likely be prepared for us to reject this option, as it is asking us to police our own people.
1.1.9.2.2.2.1. Con: If they thought it was likely we would break the agreement, they presumably would not have offered it in the first place.
1.1.9.2.3. Con: A contract agreed to in these circumstances can't be considered binding anyway, as it is coerced. So no reasonable party would take our behavior under these circumstances to be generalizable to contracts.
1.1.9.2.3.1. Con: The legal requirements of contracts are not relevant. The British will view it as binding and will respond with force if we break it.
1.1.9.3. Con: If we did become their equals, it will have been on the back of slavery which makes us morally equal with the British as well.
1.1.9.4. Con: By cooperating with the enemy and going against our own flesh and blood, we are proving to the British that we do not have any higher ideals, nor honor. They would thus never accept us among their midst.
1.1.9.4.1. Con: Even so, the idea of compromise and dealing and wheeling in order to get to what you want, in this case, surviving, is one that the British themselves have been exercising for hundreds of years and nothing particularly un-British in itself.
1.1.9.4.1.1. Pro: The British are likely to admire this pragmatism and view us more positively for it.
1.1.9.4.1.2. Con: Just because the British admire this in themselves does not mean that they will admire it in other groups. After all, then it goes against their self-interest.
1.1.9.4.1.3. Con: Racial prejudice may make it difficult for the British to see our wheeling and dealing as akin to their own behaviour instead of as another example of our untrustworthiness and barbarism.
1.1.9.4.2. Pro: We are showing the British we can easily be divided as a people.
1.1.9.5. Pro: By working with the British we will win their trust and use this to our own advantage.
1.1.9.6. Con: By accepting, we are also proving to the British that we are easily persuaded to do their bidding.
1.1.9.6.1. Con: At least we will be alive for those future negotiations. That is better than being killed on the spot.
1.1.9.7. Pro: By agreeing, we may be afforded other rights and resources to improve the quality of life for our community.
1.1.9.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.
1.1.9.7.2. Pro: Most slave owners provided their slaves with better clothing, food items, and other useful tangible goods as compensation for good behavior [\(Olwell, p.204\)](https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqNIPg69NIkC&pg=PA204&dq=slaves+rewarded+for+good+behavior&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXkYqN0JnRAhWJTSYKHTbdCNcQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.1.9.8. Con: The British will not treat us as equals due to their status as colonial masters.
1.1.9.8.1. Pro: The British have had similar relationships with innumerable colonies, and never have they accepted them as their equals.
1.1.9.8.1.1. Con: The British often work with "[dominant minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_minority)" because it serves their own needs. These dominant minority groups do enjoy favored relationships with the British in exchange for doing much of the "mid-level" management of imperialism.
1.1.9.8.1.1.1. Con: Being confined to mid-level management illustrates how the British do not accept minorities as equal.
1.1.9.8.2. Pro: The relationship with the British remains that of a principal and an agent. Once the agent does not provide a service anymore, there is little incentive to sustain the current arrangement. This is anything but equalizing.
1.1.9.8.2.1. Con: This is simply a hypothetical harm in the future. We have to consider the immediate future of the tribe; this is a question that we can deal with if we are confronted with it.
1.1.9.8.2.1.1. Pro: In doing utilitarian calculations, we are justified in weighting more proximal effects higher than more distant ones, as they are more certain to happen.
1.1.9.8.3. Pro: It seems unlikely that the same group that enslaved us will begin to treat us as their equals simply because we acquiesce.
1.1.9.8.3.1. Pro: Although we made an agreement, the British are still our enemy, and are likely to be distrusting of us as a people. This makes equality highly unlikely.
1.1.9.8.3.1.1. Con: While it is true that they are our enemies in the short term, there is no reason why we cannot improve our relation with them by cooperating with this deal.
1.1.9.8.3.1.1.1. Pro: The British regard us as their enemy because our interests do not line up. To the extent that cooperating with them changes this, we will be their enemy to a lesser degree.
1.1.9.8.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The British not only act based on how their interests relate to ours, but also based on other, more fundamental factors, for example racism.
1.1.9.8.4. Con: Even if they don't treat us as equals, their attitude towards us may improve to some extent.
1.1.10. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.
1.1.11. Con: Agreeing to the deal has the potential to cause disunity in our community.
1.1.11.1. Con: As individual Maroons are aware of their high dependency on the community, they are unlikely to threaten its integrity because of disagreements.
1.1.11.2. Pro: There will surely be community members whose family and friends are still enslaved.
1.1.11.3. Pro: This could lead to a revolt among some of our community who are unwilling to abide by the choice that we have made.
1.1.11.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.
1.1.11.3.2. Con: There will be members of the community who are unhappy with our choice regardless of the decision that is made. It is our duty to act in a way that represents the majority of our people.
1.1.11.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.2.
1.1.11.4. Pro: The escaped slaves may attempt to overthrow the Maroon leadership in order to prevent their return to the plantations.
1.1.11.4.1. Con: Escaped slaves would not have the opportunity to organize or seriously threaten the existing Maroon population.
1.1.11.4.1.1. Con: Anti-slavery portions of the Maroon community may fight with the returned slaves against those who want to collaborate with the British.
1.1.11.4.1.2. Con: Given that the alternative for these slaves is returning to severe punishment or even death, they will be desperate to avoid this happening. Desperation can give people huge strength beyond what would otherwise be expected.
1.1.11.4.1.2.1. Pro: In these situations, it is likely that the recaptured slaves could harm individuals in our community in a bid to avoid being returned.
1.1.11.4.1.2.2. Con: Individual runaway slaves are in no position to challenge the integrity of our small community given the numerical differences.
1.1.11.4.1.2.3. Con: Individual runaway slaves are likely to be exhausted once they made their way through the jungle while we are well rested.
1.1.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.
1.1.13. Pro: Being an arm of law enforcement for the British colonial state is an honorable profession. We should embrace it.
1.1.13.1. Con: A profession is only honorable so long as we are viewed that way for doing it. From the perspective of the British, we are still treated as inferior people outside of their state.
1.1.13.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.8.
1.1.13.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.1.3.
1.1.13.3. Con: Policing is not universally regarded as a noble profession.
1.1.13.3.1. Pro: In ancient Greece, the police force was drawn from [slaves](http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/05/30/the-police-in-ancient-greece/).
1.1.13.3.2. Pro: Policing has often been seen as a function of citizenship rather than as a profession, [as for example in early Germanic custom](https://historicromance.wordpress.com/2010/11/25/the-origins-of-policing-and-law-enforcement-in-england/).
1.1.13.4. Con: The profession of law enforcement is only as honorable as the law being enforced. Enforcing slavery laws is not honorable.
1.1.13.4.1. Pro: Colonial Britain exploits peoples all around the world. Becoming complicit in exploitation is not a source of honor.
1.1.13.5. Pro: There will necessarily be some manner of police in the state, who will enjoy special privileges. It may as well be us.
1.1.13.5.1. Con: Keeping in mind that we are coerced into working for the British, we can hardly call our position and reward a privilege.
1.1.13.5.2. Con: The level and effectiveness of policing is by no means given. Without us, the British control over escaped slaves may be lower than it is through our cooperation.
1.1.13.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.1.3.
1.1.13.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.13.5.4. Pro: As the police force, we will enjoy access to the tools the British provide us to aid them.
1.1.13.6. Pro: Slaves broke the law by running away. We are helping to enforce this law.
1.1.13.6.1. Con: There is nothing honorable about enforcing slavery laws.
1.1.13.7. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.13.8. Con: By policing escaped slaves, we are dishonoring our community and all anti-slavery efforts.
1.1.14. Pro: Cooperating allows us to gain strength and trust that can be used to fight back if an opportunity arises and the British are weak.
1.1.14.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.1.14.2. Pro: At some point, we may get access to resources and information that can help us overthrow the British.
1.1.14.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.3.2.1.
1.1.14.4. Con: -> See 1.1.7.4.
1.2. Option "Two":
Agree but cheat on the agreement, as best we can.
1.2.1. Con: Making a pact with the British will compromise us in the eyes of our fellow Maroons \(who wouldn't know what choice we had\).
1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.4.2.
1.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.5.5.1.
1.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.3.
1.2.1.4. Pro: We would presumably have to catch at least some slaves lest the British become suspicious.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: The expectation of this agreement is that we will actively help the British catch slaves. If slaves keep escaping but we don't catch any, the British will either assume we have cheated or else decide we are useless; in both cases, they are likely to respond by destroying us.
1.2.1.5. Pro: Assuming that there are other resistance organizations, it is unlikely that they would want to collaborate with or trust us as we support the British \(even if only to some degree\).
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: If we cooperate to the point where the British are not suspicious of us then it is also likely that other resistance organisations will assume we are cooperating fully.
1.2.2. Con: The extent to which cheating can help current slaves is limited.
1.2.2.1. Con: Better limited than no help at all.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: If the risks we bring upon our own community stand in no reasonable relationship to the benefits of cheating, limited help is not worth it.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Our cheating can harm other slaves.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: The British will make punishments harder as to enhance deterrence effects.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: As a reaction to cheating the British can rotate slaves among plantations to reduce bonding and therefore trust among slaves.
1.2.2.2.3. Pro: The British might kill or punish other slaves.
1.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.4.
1.2.2.4. Pro: The fact that we will have to police ourselves to keep law and order in the face of resistance within our Maroon community will drain resources from effectively helping current slaves.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: It will not be very difficult to police each other but more a by-product of the small size of our community which allows to know each other very well. On the island [Santa Cruz del Islote](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/01/05/how_people_live_on_the_most_crowded_island_on_earth.html), for example, there is no police because the community polices itself.
1.2.2.5. Pro: As escaped slaves whom we do not return to the British have nowhere to go, they would most likely want to join our community. As runaway slaves join our community this would put an ever greater burden on us.
1.2.2.5.1. Pro: We would likely be reliant on the payments by the British for our livelihood. These do not necessarily scale with the size of our community and might quickly become insufficient.
1.2.2.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.6.1.
1.2.2.5.1.2. Con: Being runaway slaves we already survived independently from the British before ending up in the cul-de-sac. We are not reliant on the British for our livelihood.
1.2.2.5.2. Con: The greater population for our community would not be a burden. If anything it would make us stronger.
1.2.2.5.2.1. Pro: The additional people act as a disincentive to the British to taking further action against us because they make us seem stronger.
1.2.2.5.2.1.1. Con: A growing size of our community might leave the British with the impression that they are losing control of the situation and might thus provoke a preemptive strike.
1.2.2.5.2.1.1.1. Con: The ability of the British to monitor our Maroon community is questionable.
1.2.2.5.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: As we are confined to the mountains, it will be difficult for the British to keep track of us.
1.2.2.5.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: The information and communication technology of the eighteenth century British colonies will make it difficult to monitor us.
1.2.2.5.2.2. Pro: A larger community means a greater prosperity for us because there are more people to generate wealth.
1.2.2.5.2.2.1. Con: It is unlikely that we will have many means of creating wealth under the prospective circumstances.
1.2.2.5.2.2.2. Pro: A greater number of people allows us to more efficiently collect food, water and building materials.
1.2.2.5.2.2.2.1. Con: At the same time, the terrain that we are in is rather inhospitable and won't sustain too large of a population.
1.2.2.5.2.2.2.1.1. Con: The low productivity of our terrain is mitigated by the number of people we have at our disposal.
1.2.2.5.3. Pro: With greater population comes an increasing risk of British attacks.
1.2.2.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.5.2.1.1.
1.2.2.5.3.2. Pro: With more people living in the community, this increases the possibility of the British attacking us as they realize that we have broken the agreement. This decreases the net benefit of cheating as it comes with great risk.
1.2.2.5.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.5.2.1.1.1.
1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.2.4. Pro: Agreeing and cheating is the only of the three options that helps slaves. If you agree and become the slave police, you hurt slaves. If you fight to the death, you're dead and useless to them. If you agree but renege, and help only one slave, you've helped someone.

Fighting to the death, or agreeing and following the promise would be done out of a sense of honor. To prioritize your individual honor over the suffering of slaves is selfish vanity masquerading as morality.
1.2.4.1. Con: This only helps the slaves and could possibly damage our own society.
1.2.5. Con: Any form of lying or cheating is immoral.
1.2.5.1. Con: This has to be viewed relatively in comparison to the immorality of propping up the slave trade. It is necessary to trade off the morality of lying for the sake of defeating a greater harm.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: We have to make moral trade offs all the time where we sometimes have to accept a lesser evil to prevent a greater one. This is merely one of these on a larger scale.
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: Lying does not do significant harm to anyone in this case.
1.2.5.1.2.1. Con: Lying, in this situation, actually endangers lives. If our behavior were to be discovered by the British, they would certainly punish and possibly murder us.
1.2.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: If we do not follow their orders, they will kill us anyway.
1.2.5.2. Con: In this situation, lying is a form of protecting lives. Just like killing [can be justified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justifiable_homicide) if done for this purpose, so does it justify lying here.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.1.
1.2.5.3. Pro: As long we do not cheat or lie, we at least do not lose the moral high ground in relations with the British.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: The British will not be able to accuse us of lying or cheating in the future, which eliminates one source of conflict and punishment.
1.2.5.3.1.1. Con: Claims someone would be lying are easy to fabricate. The British can just make them up.
1.2.5.3.2. Con: There is no moral imperative not to lie when resisting brutal oppression. Thus, lying and cheating to the British will not affect our moral standing.
1.2.5.3.3. Con: Our moral standing is less important than the outcomes of our actions. If our actions are on balance good, then we don't need to worry about the moral high ground.
1.2.5.4. Con: There is the possibility of cheating on any agreement by the British so we cannot fully trust them ourselves.
1.2.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.1.
1.2.5.4.2. Pro: The British have no incentive to be reliable partners as they will not suffer any future sanctions by breaching the agreement.
1.2.5.4.3. Pro: The character of the British whom we are dealing with is untrustworthy.
1.2.5.4.3.1. Pro: Because of a feeling of [white supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy) the British do not value us as an equal negotiation partner.
1.2.5.4.3.2. Pro: The British have a history of not upholding their written agreements; it's unlikely they will uphold their verbal agreements as well.
1.2.5.4.3.2.1. Pro: The British immediately violated the terms of [Treaty of Paris 1783](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\(1783\)#Consequences). We could suffer from an equally swift violation by the British.
1.2.5.4.3.2.2. Pro: The British preferred to not stipulate a slave code on Jamaica to retain arbitrary power \([Patterson, p. 291](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27856434?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\).
1.2.5.4.3.2.3. Con: Singular examples for broken treaties are not necessarily representative. The vast majority of treaties signed by the British were most likely not breached.
1.2.5.4.3.2.3.1. Con: How the British have acted with respect to all treaties is likely not the most relevant data point. The question is how they act in those treaties where it is advantageous for them to break it and they also believe they can do so without significant repercussions.
1.2.5.4.3.2.4. Pro: The British did not uphold the agreement set forth in the [Treaty of Portsmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Portsmouth_\(1713\)#Aftermath) of 1713 with the Eastern Abenaki tribe.
1.2.5.4.3.2.5. Con: As runaway slaves we are unlikely to be aware of other agreements the British broke.
1.2.5.4.3.3. Pro: It is likely that the British previously offered some sort of bounty on us, as they did with runaway slaves in [Virginia](http://history.org/history/teaching/runaway.cfm).
1.2.5.4.4. Pro: From the British perspective we cheated on them once we ran away. This might encourage the British to give tit for tat.
1.2.5.4.4.1. Con: We had never agreed to our enslavement. There is thus no meaningful sense in which we cheated.
1.2.5.4.4.1.1. Con: How we regard the way we ended up in slavery is unimportant for how the British form their perspective.
1.2.5.4.4.2. Pro: [Overseers](http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/f/franklin-slaves.html) already perceived it as cheating by slaves when they worked slowly.
1.2.5.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.
1.2.5.5. Con: One is not bound to an agreement coerced under the threat of annihilation of one's tribe. We should therefore choose to cheat on the agreement instead.
1.2.5.5.1. Pro: Given the coercive nature of the agreement, the British can have no reasonable expectation of us upholding our word.
1.2.5.5.2. Pro: If your own survival is on the line, you do not have an obligation to resist injustice openly, but you should still try to do so covertly, to the extent that it is possible.
1.2.5.5.2.1. Pro: We have a positive moral duty to resist an evil like slavery to the extent that we can reasonably be expected to.
1.2.5.5.2.1.1. Con: When the punishment for disobedience may well be death, we do not have any moral duties beyond doing what is best for our community.
1.2.5.5.2.1.2. Con: While we have a positive moral duty to resist an evil like slavery, that positive moral duty is over-ridden by our stronger moral duty to self-preservation.
1.2.5.5.2.1.2.1. Con: There is no moral duty to self-preservation. There is only a desire for ourselves. That desire needs to be weighed against moral considerations of the place of slavery in our society.
1.2.5.6. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.
1.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.
1.2.7. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.
1.2.8. Pro: We take part in working towards the end of slavery if we agree and cheat.
1.2.8.1. Con: Our cheating will not support the cause against slavery in any meaningful way. That is, the best we might be able to hope for is harm minimization.
1.2.8.2. Con: By creating the outward impression that we are working for the British, future acts of resistance and escape attempts by current slaves might be discouraged, thus harming the anti-slavery effort.
1.2.8.2.1. Pro: Knowledge about the cheating cannot be allowed to spread too far, for example among the current slaves, as every additional confidant is another risk factor.
1.2.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.
1.2.8.4. Pro: The prospect of joining our community might encourage other slaves to escape, lead them into a better life and strengthen the resistance against slavery.
1.2.8.5. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.2.8.6. Pro: Escaped slaves are certainly better off in a community that can support them than on their own in a hostile land.
1.2.9. Pro: Cheating will be easy for us as we will be under minimal control of the British.
1.2.9.1. Pro: Given the inaccessibility of the mountain regions, the British have to assume that we will make contact with only a fraction of escaped slaves.
1.2.9.1.1. Con: It is likely that the British offer us the agreement only because they believe we will get in touch with a significant number of escaped slaves.
1.2.9.2. Pro: The British are most likely expecting many escaped slaves to die in the hostile environment without anyone knowing about their fate.
1.2.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.1.5.1.
1.2.9.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.1.
1.2.9.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.5.3.2.
1.2.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.5.2.1.1.1.
1.2.9.6. Con: As the British have little reason to trust us, they will most likely keep tight watch over our activities.
1.2.9.6.1. Pro: Slaves were most likely [branded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_branding#Branding_in_American_slavery). This makes it easy for the British to keep track of us.
1.2.9.6.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.5.2.1.1.1.
1.2.9.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.5.2.1.1.1.2.
1.2.10. Pro: Our community survives if we agree and cheat.
1.2.10.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.
1.2.10.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.2.10.3. Con: We can be discovered and punished or even killed.
1.2.10.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.6.
1.2.10.3.2. Pro: It is likely that the British would subject us to additional pain before killing us as a disincentive to others for disobeying them. This ultimately makes this option worse than dying in the first place.
1.2.10.3.2.1. Con: Suicide before we are captured is always an option.
1.2.10.3.3. Con: There is a chance of not being caught.
1.2.10.3.3.1. Con: It is quite likely that we would eventually be caught as the British would likely notice if we failed to catch any runaway slaves for them.
1.2.10.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.5.2.1.1.1.
1.2.10.3.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.
1.2.10.3.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.2.
1.2.10.3.3.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.1.
1.2.10.3.3.6. Con: -> See 1.2.2.5.3.2.
1.2.10.3.4. Pro: If discovered, we may be sold into slavery as punishment. This is undoubtedly an undesirable and miserable outcome.
1.2.10.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.8.2.1.
1.2.10.3.5. Pro: This will undoubtedly be painful for our community to watch, and will certainly deter any efforts to cheat in the future.
1.2.10.4. Pro: Living free on our own land in the mountains is enjoyable.
1.2.10.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.
1.2.10.4.2. Con: We will live in fear of being caught and punished by the British. This makes for a unpleasant and dangerous life.
1.2.10.5. Con: -> See 1.2.10.4.2.
1.2.10.6. Pro: This option will maximize the number of lives saved and minimize the suffering caused. Minimizing suffering and the loss of lives is always desirable.
1.2.10.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.2.10.6.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.2.10.6.3. Pro: By agreeing to the terms of the British, we save our own lives. At the same time, by not actually complying with the demand to help track down slaves, we minimize the suffering of slaves.
1.2.10.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.
1.2.10.6.4. Pro: The more of us who live the higher our aggregate utility and welfare.
1.2.10.6.4.1. Con: Given the unpredictability of our future happiness, it is hard to know whether death will ultimately be a happier outcome for our community.
1.2.10.6.4.2. Pro: Fighting to the death will minimize our aggregate future happiness.
1.2.10.6.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.10.6.4.1.
1.2.10.6.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.5.3.2.
1.2.10.7. Con: -> See 1.2.2.5.
1.2.11. Con: The British are likely to take action against us if we cheat and they find out.
1.2.11.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.
1.2.11.2. Con: The British can only punish us if they find out. We can be clever in how we resist.
1.2.11.2.1. Con: If we do not return any slaves to the British they will notice that we cheat. It is difficult to do this in a 'clever' way.
1.2.11.2.1.1. Con: If we can conceal the fact that escaped slaves come to us, then the British will assume they've slipped away elsewhere in the remote mountains.
1.2.11.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.1.
1.2.11.2.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.
1.2.11.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.5.2.1.1.1.2.
1.2.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.3.2.
1.2.11.4. Con: Minor breaches of the agreement are unlikely to lead to significant repercussions.
1.2.11.4.1. Pro: Setting up a new army to fight us will require significant resources by the British for gains that are minor.
1.2.11.4.1.1. Con: They don't need a new army to catch us. After all, they managed to catch us in the current situation so it seems probably that they would be able to do so again with relative ease.
1.2.11.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.
1.2.11.4.2. Con: From historical experience it is easy to imagine that minor breaches are followed by massive force. For example, minor breaches of the first Maroon treaty lead to a second Maroon war.
1.2.11.4.3. Con: It seems strange to suggest that this would be a minor breach. If the entire agreement is premised on catching slaves then this breach would dissolve the agreement as a whole.
1.2.11.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.
1.2.11.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.
1.2.11.4.6. Con: If the British thought that we could easily break the agreement and get away with it, then they would have been unlikely to offer it in the first place. The fact that they did points to the fact that they are confident in their ability to destroy us either way.
1.2.11.4.7. Pro: The British offered us a deal knowing we could cheat.
1.2.11.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.4.6.
1.2.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.
1.3. Option "Three":
Fight to the death \(and kill at least one of the British\).
1.3.1. Con: This is a particularly bad tactical situation. Even if one prefers to go down fighting, one should wait for better circumstances.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Appearing to cooperate allows us to gain strength and trust that can be used to fight back if an opportunity arises and the British are weak.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: One opportunity would be to engage in guerrilla war, which is a possible scenario for defeating the British.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: We are living in mountain territory that is suitable for protracted guerrilla warfare.
1.3.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: This would give considerable protection if the British ever decided to break our agreement.
1.3.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.1.5.1.
1.3.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Protracted guerrilla warfare is not possible without access to supply lines which are at the coastal areas.
1.3.1.1.2.1.3. Con: A state of warfare is a worst-case scenario, especially against an opponent superior in manpower, equipment and training like the British.
1.3.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: While not desirable, a state of warfare is not the worst-case scenario; slavery and death are worse than war.
1.3.1.1.2.1.4. Con: Guerrilla warfare often depends on convincing local population to support us. As we operate in uninhabited territory this is not the case.
1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: There is no long-term success to expect based on the current situation which will wipe us out.
1.3.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Guerrilla war is [asymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare). Our strategy can be successful in the long-term even if the British have an overwhelming military strength in absolute terms.
1.3.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: British forces are virtually endless.
1.3.1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.3.2.
1.3.1.1.2.2.3. Pro: The population of slaves, which represents our maximum striking force, is controlled by the British.
1.3.1.1.2.3. Pro: The terrain is on our side as it allows us to trade space for time and launch attacks only when victory is certain.
1.3.1.1.2.4. Pro: Our cultural heritage which focused on fighting with spears, hunting and camouflage helps our cause.
1.3.1.1.2.5. Pro: Knowledge of botany, herbal medicines and foods from Africa allows us to better sustain operations in inaccessible territory.
1.3.1.1.2.5.1. Pro: For slaves all over the Americas their botanical knowledge became what was labelled "[the incubators of African survival](http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520269965)".
1.3.1.1.2.5.2. Pro: Slaves brought with them knowledge that was useful in the new territories of colonies, such as in applying irrigation systems in South Carolina \([Gold, p.6](https://ricediversity.org/outreach/educatorscorner/documents/Carolina-Gold-Student-handout.pdf)\).
1.3.1.1.2.5.3. Pro: Medical knowledge they acquired in their homelands helped slaves to survive in the colonies, such as in Georgia \([Fett, p. 83](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/35653603_Body_and_soul_African_American_healing_in_southern_antebellum_plantation_communities_1800-1860)\).
1.3.1.1.2.6. Pro: The British are highly sensitive to tropical illnesses, such as malaria, and depend on their supply lines that stretch not far from coastal areas.
1.3.1.1.2.6.1. Pro: It has been argued that the repeated exposure of African slaves to malaria has created innate immunities \([Esposito, p. 8](http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/36118/MWP_2015_09.pdf)\)
1.3.1.1.2.6.2. Con: The British can fairly easily protect themselves from malaria by drinking [quinine](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/foreigners/2013/08/gin_and_tonic_kept_the_british_empire_healthy_the_drink_s_quinine_powder.html).
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: The British trusting us will allow us to feed the resistance intelligence about the British.
1.3.1.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: We can spy on their defense and supply lines.
1.3.1.1.3.3. Pro: We can pay British traders to give us information on global events, such as rebellions in other colonies.
1.3.1.1.3.4. Con: This assumes that the British trust us enough for us to glean valuable information. This seems unlikely given the asymmetry of the agreement.
1.3.1.1.3.5. Con: This assumes that there is an organized resistance to which we are connected.  But that isn't necessarily true.
1.3.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.7.4.
1.3.1.1.5. Con: The British have been ruling over Jamaica and running their slavery regime [since 1655](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica#British_rule_.281655.E2.80.931962.29); there is little reason to assume that this rule will end in the near future.
1.3.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.2.
1.3.1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.3.2.1.
1.3.1.1.8. Con: This will most likely only work once; the British will never again agree to this kind of arrangement. Attacking them while they are weak is thus not a good option as it would hurt our larger struggle against slavery.
1.3.1.2. Con: Better circumstances are not guaranteed to us. Therefore, our tactic has to be to fight and cause some harm to the British.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: It is unlikely that we would find worse circumstances than being trapped in a cul-de-sac. As a result, the worst case if we try and wait for better circumstances is that we get into the same situation.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: It is better to die and cause some harm than to be faced with the possibility of being physically and/or emotionally tortured for the rest of our lives.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.
1.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.1.2.
1.3.1.2.2.3. Con: Other, better opportunities for resistance might come along. The fate we choose by not fighting is most likely not permanent.
1.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.2.2.
1.3.2. Pro: If our population is wiped out, future escaping slaves will find a relatively sparsely-inhabited mountainous region where they can live and hide from the British.
1.3.2.1. Con: The absence of established social support structures, like families helping each other, will make it difficult for newly-escaped slaves to survive in the mountains.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Newly runaway slaves will easily form these social support structures because they are dependent on them.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Social support is crucial in safeguarding mental and physical [health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921311/).
1.3.2.2. Pro: The British would have little incentive to search the mountains to find a small number of escapees, so the next group to escape will have a better chance of avoiding recapture by the British.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: While there may be fewer escaped slaves in the mountains, the British would now be able to travel through the mountains without fear of attack by the Maroons. This freedom of movement will make escaped slaves more likely to be recaptured, not less.
1.3.2.3. Con: The British have established knowledge about the territory and logistical supply lines in the fight against us. The next group of runaway slaves will face a different scenario to ours.
1.3.2.4. Con: The size of the Maroon community never went beyond a few hundred individuals. There is no reason why both we and the runaway slaves would not be able to simultaneously live in the mountains.
1.3.3. Pro: Dying a heroic death in battle is desirable.
1.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Stories of heroic self-sacrifice against impossible odds are often [mythologized](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9781137362537_5#page-1) and can be the basis for strengthening our common identity.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: One of the most repeated stories in human history is the [Battle of Thermopylae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae) renowned for the brave fight of the Spartans.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: The Spartans are remembered because they actually put up a fight. We would be slaughtered.
1.3.3.2.1.2. Con: Also the 300ish Spartans are actually not remembered for the true account of their sacrifice but a very much glorified version of it. That account actually helped authoritarian regimes justify their accounts of violent and oppressive. So in our current trilemma who says that it is not the story of the one British soldier we kill that will be told that way as a heroic story?
1.3.3.3. Con: Our death would not protect anyone, hence we will not be remembered for it.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: Deaths for a noble cause may be remembered even if no one is aided by it.
1.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: Los Ninos Heroes \(["The Boy Heroes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C3%B1os_H%C3%A9roes)\) are still remembered in Mexico for their deaths, despite the fact that they had no impact on the Mexican-American war.
1.3.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Of all the fallen ones during the Mexican-American war, next to none are remembered, which proves the point that even though some are remembered, the chance of us being one of those lucky few, is absurdly small.
1.3.3.3.1.2. Con: History is written by the victors, and as the British will be victorious in this battle, there is little reason to assume that history will remember us and if so, fondly.
1.3.3.3.1.2.1. Con: This does not mean that the actions of small groups of resistance cannot also be remembered for their feats.
1.3.3.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Even if they are remembered, they are usually portrayed as what they are: insignificant opposition to those in power.
1.3.3.3.2. Pro: If we protect no one there will be no one to spread our heroic story with the fervor to achieve myth status.
1.3.3.4. Con: Interpretations of heroic deeds change over time and so will we be remembered less for what we did but more for how useful it is in any given political context.
1.3.3.4.1. Con: This is not necessarily a reason against a heroic fight. If future societies take a stance against slavery, we might be remembered for our sacrifice.
1.3.3.5. Con: This honor will be of no use for anyone as we will be dead, and as there will be no place for future runaway slaves to go.
1.3.3.6. Con: Given the British are killing people like us all over the world our sacrifice will just be drowned out in the abundance of sacrifices around the world. We are just one of thousands.
1.3.3.7. Con: The chance of anyone becoming immortalized in history, even for the most famous of us, is next to zero, given a long enough time horizon and a continuing popping up of famous people.
1.3.3.8. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.2.
1.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.
1.3.5. Pro: We should be a part of the resistance to slavery in this small but significant way.
1.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.
1.3.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.6.3.
1.3.5.3. Con: Fighting to the death hurts the resistance to slavery as escaping slaves will no longer have an obvious place to go.
1.3.5.3.1. Con: All alternatives to this scenario involve the acceptance of the British agreement. Consequently, they also deprive escaping slaves of a place to go to.
1.3.5.3.2. Con: This would only be true if we were the only community of Maroons. But there are likely others.
1.3.5.4. Con: Fighting to the death hurts the resistance to slavery as the fate of the Maroons will discourage future resistance.
1.3.5.5. Con: -> See 1.2.8.
1.3.5.6. Pro: This will show the British that even through their system of slavery they cannot impose total control over us.
1.3.5.6.1. Con: There can be no negotiation or realization that slavery does not work if we are all dead. The British will most likely believe they have won.
1.3.5.6.2. Con: We should expect that other escaped slaves will be self-interested and will choose life for themselves and for their children. The British also know that. So our sacrifice would be in vain.
1.3.5.6.2.1. Con: Even if not everyone agrees, the fact that there are some people who are willing to die instead of become controlled sends a strong message to the British.
1.3.5.6.3. Pro: Increasing the cost of slavery will make certain slavery operations economically unfeasible and will thus reduce the total amount of slavery.
1.3.5.6.3.1. Con: The costs of crushing small rebellions are probably seen as inevitable in the context of maintaining a system of slavery. It would therefore not call the system in question.
1.3.5.6.3.1.1. Con: The costs of resistance in the context of slavery have been described as a "significant drain" on slaveholder's expected income, especially once lost work days, broken tools and other side-effects are taken into account \([Rodriguez, p. xli](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=h86YKfO-9RgC&pg=PR41&lpg=PR41&dq=slavery+cost+rebellion&source=bl&ots=0E-qAJrrrf&sig=LqGBk6hRnTgoZIlv2xMiSNsLvz4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje8Ii317jRAhWMw7wKHYitBqcQ6AEINTAF#v=onepage&q=slavery%20cost%20rebellion&f=false)\).
1.3.5.6.3.1.2. Pro: There were many slave rebellions in [Jamaica](http://abolition.e2bn.org/resistance_54.html) and elsewhere in the [Caribbean](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/caribbeanhistory/slavery-negotiating-freedom.htm). The British most likely became used to it.
1.3.5.7. Pro: Even if we die, we can still inflict some harm on the British.
1.3.5.7.1. Pro: Although we will die, we will at least weaken the number of British, and thus weaken their future efforts and resources.
1.3.5.7.1.1. Con: The battle would undoubtedly hurt the Maroons' military more than the British. Whatever damage done to the British forces will be more than offset by the easing of the military threat to Britain's interests on the island. This frees up resources for Britain's future endeavours.
1.3.5.7.2. Pro: These deaths would have the additional benefit of harming the morale of the British.
1.3.5.7.3. Con: The British have superior equipment and training and will likely suffer only insignificant damages and losses.
1.3.5.7.4. Con: The result would be even more animosity and the lust for revenge on the side of the British, and thus even more suffering for those slaves still alive.
1.3.5.7.4.1. Con: Plantation owners have no incentive to treat their slaves badly out of rage as they consider them assets to lose.
1.3.5.7.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.1.3.
1.3.5.8. Con: Our death will not guarantee that other runaway slaves will not be caught.
1.3.5.8.1. Con: Our death may not guarantee that other slaves will not be caught, however fighting will likely cause some injury to the British after which they will need time to recuperate and regroup. This may be create enough hindrance for some slaves to effectively escape.
1.3.5.8.1.1. Con: The few British we kill will not make a major difference as it was mostly [plantation overseers](http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai/enslavement/text4/text4read.htm) who controlled slaves and not soldiers.
1.3.6. Pro: If the only way that we can continue living is by acquiescing to slavers, then life is not worth living.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Insofar as we consider self-actualization and mental freedom part of a fulfilling life, a life spent serving another against your will is not worth living.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: Self-actualization and mental freedom require both the freedom to think as you wish and the ability to act freely on those beliefs.
1.3.6.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.6.2.1.
1.3.6.1.2. Con: Serving another against our will is a necessary sacrifice to save as many enslaved people as we can. We are ensuring the 'good life' for them and their descendants.
1.3.6.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.6.2.1.
1.3.6.1.4. Con: It is entirely possible to find worth in living even if you are coerced in one aspect of life.
1.3.6.1.4.1. Pro: People are constantly coerced — whether by their financial constraints or by laws — yet they can still be happy.
1.3.6.1.4.1.1. Con: A life under legal and financial constraints is certainly better than one in a racist environment and under the British coercion to work for them.
1.3.6.2. Con: As long as we have the hope that we can improve our lot later, that hope can sustain our continued living, even if it means temporarily acquiescing to the British.
1.3.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.5.
1.3.6.3. Con: -> See 1.3.6.1.4.
1.3.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.2.
1.3.7. Con: Fighting makes no sense from a utilitarian perspective.
1.3.7.1. Con: If fighting leads to other people not being enslaved, then it would maximize aggregate happiness and would make sense from a utilitarian perspective.
1.3.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.8.
1.3.7.2. Pro: Our death can only be useful once, for whatever it's worth. Then we are useless to ourselves, to our Maroon community and to the larger effort to oppose slavery.
1.3.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.6.4.
