Discussion Title: Is Popular Protest Productive?

1. Popular protest is a productive tool in a democracy.
1.1. Pro: Popular protest and civil disobedience have historically been agents of political change.
1.1.1. Pro: Some believe that violent protests, including armed force, is necessary to overthrow a tyrannical government. [Violent Protests Are Justified in Some Cases.](http://theconversation.com/is-violent-political-protest-ever-justified-72630)
1.1.1.1. Pro: Riots are seen by some as the only available mechanism to overthrow tyrannical government since it it the ultimate expression of protest. [Riots Are Justifiable Mechanisms of Protest.](http://time.com/3951282/riot-violence-use-american-history/)
1.1.1.2. Con: The conduct of popular protesters often compromises their message.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Popular protesters may participate in vandalism or other harmful activities, thus alienating would-be supporters.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: The conduct of protesters can be seen as passion, commitment to their cause, or equally as irresponsible and reckless. Sometimes it is more important for protesters to behave in an impolite way in order to be heard, than to be considered well-behaved.
1.1.1.2.3. Con: [Peaceful protesting](https://share.america.gov/peaceful-protests-bring-social-change/) is the norm in America.
1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Violent protests aren't the norm everywhere, but gain the most publicity.
1.1.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: In [South Africa](https://mg.co.za/article/2016-06-07-new-stats-show-that-nine-out-of-11-protests-a-day-are-peaceful), for instance, 9 out of 11 protests a day are peaceful.
1.1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Since January 2017, the US has seen about [4,296 protests](https://www.bu.edu/research/articles/counting-american-protests/), most of which had no reports of violence.
1.1.1.2.3.2. Con: Protests can involve violence, whether intentionally, or due to a loss of control during an originally-peaceful protest.
1.1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Violent protests are counterproductive to achieving the stated goals. [psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pop-psych/201702/why-non-violent-protests-work)
1.1.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Violent protesting is a distraction from the real issue. Peaceful protesting is much more effective. [theodysseyonline.com](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/five-reasons-why-violent-protesting-is-not-the-answer)
1.1.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.3.2.
1.1.2. Con: Political change is not always good, as in case of [Russian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution).
1.2. Con: Few pieces of legislation can cite a popular protest as a its primary source.
1.2.1. Con: Protests can be valuable in helping move along the process that creates legislation. Protests can create a political incentive to pass legislation, by demonstrating that citizens want their representatives to take action on a particular issue.
1.2.1.1. Con: This same effect can be accomplished with reasoned appeals \(i.e. phone calls, letters, social media\).
1.2.1.2. Con: A protest is only an incentive to pass legislation insofar as a specific piece of legislation is the target of a protest. More often than not, this is not the case. Protests target internalized prejudices of the public or perceived institutional injustices, not specific pieces of legislation.
1.2.2. Con: The [Civil Rights Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#Origins) is an example of law that was passed after many protests.
1.3. Con: In exercising their own free speech, popular protesters can infringe upon the free speech of others.
1.3.1. Pro: This is particularly true on university campuses, where ideological minorities can be silenced by popular protesters.
1.3.1.1. Con: Those who feel silenced on university campuses are often ideological minorities who have traditionally held positions of power. They may not be silenced, but instead are experiencing a shifting/ redrawing of power, where they have less voice because others, previously silenced, have a voice.
1.4. Pro: Popular protest gives voice and visibility to groups who would otherwise go unheard.
1.4.1. Con: Would-be protesters have many other platforms on which to promote their message, including social media and organized events.
1.4.1.1. Con: Contribution on other platforms are frequently a tree falling in the forest when nobody is watching.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Arguably, the sheer amount of protests that take place can make protests 'a tree falling in the forest when nobody is watching'. Protests only have knock-on impacts if they are lucky/ well organised in attracting attention on \(social\) media.
1.4.2. Pro: Not all groups within society are equally educated, politically active, empowered to voice their opinions, or have equal access to the political classes. Protests do not require good education, or other barriers, that people may face in trying to voice opinions in other settings. The act of protesting is in itself declaring an opinion and making it visible to others.
1.4.2.1. Con: This is exactly why popular protests are ineffective, even dangerous. Popular protests encourage a mob mentality or outrage that is justified not by factual evidence gained through education, but is instead justified by personal experience.
1.5. Pro: Popular protest reveals popular support both for and against issues.
1.5.1. Con: Such support is revealed every day on social media, television, and even in personal conversations. Popular protests are unnecessary to reveal something as simple as an opinion.
1.5.1.1. Con: We often choose to surround ourselves with like-minded friends, consume media that interests us, and live among people who are of similar educational/ economic status to us. This may make some opinions/ topics seem far more normal or acceptable than others. Popular protests force us to confront the size and scope of other viewpoints within society.
1.5.2. Pro: For highly controversial topics, there are often counter-protests, e.g. a [pro-life rally](https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/prochoice-protesters-clash-at-prolife-rally/news-story/172d2b7fbf8a9548000e85fa4be4ca94?nk=ce7308f9f0797a1d5e9cff97dc8bbf14-1534693188) will see a pro-choice 'response', or far right rallies [experience](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/01/riot-in-portland-as-far-right-marchers-clash-with-anti-facists) an 'anti-fascist' response.
1.5.3. Pro: Changes in numbers of protesters at rallies for particular causes are often used as an indicator of social support for that cause.
1.5.3.1. Pro: This is particularly important with the rise of discussion online, as public turnout may both reflect public opinion \(possibly more accurately than 'likes' online\) and influence public opinion through media coverage.
1.6. Con: There are more effective means of change available to the public, such as the right to petition.
1.6.1. Pro: In democracies, citizens have many political tools at their disposal -- including the franchise, petition, interaction with representatives, etc.
1.7. Pro: Popular protest gives adherents opportunities for networking, interaction, and fundraising for their cause.
1.7.1. Pro: Getting to meet others who are interested in the same cause can be very energising for activists. Protests can also create a focus for this energy, allowing the adherents to pool their skills and connections and capitalise on any goodwill/ public interest/ media coverage arising from the protest.
1.7.2. Con: The same opportunities are easily generated through information evenings, public meetings and other forms of gathering, without civil disobedience or public inconvenience being required.
1.8. Pro: Protests are a mechanism through which citizens can hold their political representatives to account.
1.8.1. Con: Often, such political representatives care little about the actions of popular protesters. Such reactions are becoming so common, political representatives have become numb to their occurrence.
1.8.2. Pro: Democracy means the rule of the people. That is, the people's will is paramount. One of the central defining features of a democracy is that you have a *right* to protest. A democracy that denies the right to popular protest is no longer a democracy.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.10. Pro: Popular protest convinces many people that they can do something positive to bring about social change. This facilitates further political activity, including running for office.
