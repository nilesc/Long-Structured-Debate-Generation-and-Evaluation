Discussion Title: Capital Punishment in the US: Inhumane or Just?

1. Capital punishment should be abolished in the United States.
1.1. Pro: Death penalty generates too many ethical difficulties for those involved in the process.
1.1.1. Pro: Medical professionals will often be forced to violate their individual code of ethics, in order to administer or supervise the death penalty.
1.1.1.1. Con: There are methods of execution that do not require a doctor, such as electrocution, hanging, lethal gas and firing squad.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: All of these methods have severe flaws, which is why they are no longer used: Hanging is unreliable and causes a painful and slow death by strangulation, which is why in 1886 a bill was passed to find alternatives. The alternative discovered was electrocution - which even when it works causes a horrific and painful death. And often it doesn't; there have been 84 botched electrocutions in US history.  [Gas, similarly, often fails](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/some-examples-post-furman-botched-executions). Lethal injection is actually even *less* reliable.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: At present, lethal injection is the most [common method](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/methods-execution) of execution in the US.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Lethal injection requires medical personnel being directly  involved in killing. This is a fundamental contravention of medical ethics.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Death penality undermines a basic ethical foundation of medicine — first, [do no harm.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath#.22First_do_no_harm.22)
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: This can be seriously doubted, if one thinks of euthanasia. Physicians there act in the best interest of their patients  which is particularly not to preserve their life.
1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: However, a physician preparing lethal injection would not be acting in the best interest of their patient \(the soon to be executed man lying before him\), but only in the best interest of the state.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: The obligation to practice death penalty forces doctors have to violate the [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath), which protects the right to life.
1.1.1.3. Con: Doctors have no right to break the law because of personal values and beliefs. This would be highly unprofessional.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: Participating in killing a human is highly unprofessional, to a doctor. The doctor's oath does not say "do no harm unless the state really really wishes I would".
1.1.1.3.2. Con: The American Medical Association prohibits doctors from being involved in executions. This has led to lower standards in choosing the members of the execution team, and means that the executions pose additional, unjustified danger to the condemned. This has led the doctor who developed the modern lethal injection protocol to say "It never occurred to me when we set this up that we’d have complete idiots administering the drugs."
1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: That is not a valid argument against capital punishment -- it's \(at best\) an argument against using lethal injection if it requires skilled doctors and the AMA has chosen to take a political position against it. If instead, we used firing squads, hanging, or other methods, no doctors would be needed. So, if lack of skilled doctors is the problem, the solution is to change the method of execution, not eliminate the punishment these people deserve.
1.1.1.3.3. Con: Doctor's don't need to break the law to avoid executions; they can simply refuse to participate. That means that executions strongly select in favour of doctors who *don't* take their professional ethics as seriously.  The procedure is therefore [often performed by less-competent medical personnel](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-execution-medical/troubled-u-s-executions-raise-questions-about-doctors-in-death-chamber-idUSKBN0FU26C20140725), who have no idea how to intervene when something goes wrong.
1.1.1.4. Con: The American Medical Association [disallows](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/1775) its members from participating in executions. When they do not participate, the ethical conflict is avoided.
1.1.1.5. Pro: It is not ethical to make another human being carry the weight of killing someone the legal way. [Dr. Allen Ault](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2566327/I-nightmares-Former-prison-commissioner-supervised-executions-Georgia-confesses-deaths-haunted-him.html) was in charge of death penalties until the 90's when he resigned. He was interviewed in 2014 by BBC in the "HardTalk", and he still cannot find something that will ease those memories, one particular quote that always get me is the following: "His head snapped back, and I knew I had killed another person".
1.1.1.6. Pro: The top medical officer for Washington State's Department of Corrections [resigned](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/washington-prison-doctor-quits-over-death-penalty-1/) prior to the 2008 execution of Darold Ray Stenson believing that participation in executions violated his professional ethics.
1.1.1.7. Con: Not necessarily. Historically, medical professionals have not been required to conduct executions. A hangman or head-chopper does not require a Doctorate in Medicine.
1.1.1.7.1. Con: Historically, those methods of execution which did not require medical expertise were rejected as gruesome, torturous, unreliable and abhorrent.

There are reasons we no longer perform hanging or decapitation.
1.1.1.7.2. Pro: In the US currently, all executions are done via lethal injection. The American Medical Association [prohibits](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/05/death-penalty-lethal-injections-untrained-doctors/) its members from participating in lethal injections.
1.1.2. Pro: [Some jury members](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/15/us/juries-reject-death-penalty-in-nearly-all-federal-trials.html?mcubz=1) are reluctant to convict if it means putting someone to death.
1.1.2.1. Con: The very basis of our legal system is that you are innocent until proven guilty beyond any reasonable doubt. Jury members being reluctant to sentence a man to death unless they're absolutely sure he's guilty is how the system is supposed to work.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: While jury members being reluctant to condemn a man to death unless proven unequivocally guilty is how it is "supposed" to work, it is difficult, nigh on impossible, to weed out the various secret motivations that might lead a juror to prematurely condemn someone \(racial hatred, sadistic streak, psychopathy\).
1.1.3. Con: Many enforcers of death penalty view themselves as [protectors](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/the-enforcers-of-the-death-penalty/379901/), not murderers.
1.1.4. Pro: Even in carrying out the death penalty, the person\(s\) who carries out the execution and the state that authorizes it suffers a continued injury to their own conscience. In this way, everyone affected by carrying out the death penalty is negatively affected and on these grounds, it is inhumane and unjust.
1.1.4.1. Pro: As it is always wrong to kill another human being, the executioner commits a crime and the state does the same by authorizing it. So in effect, it only serves to create more criminals.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: It is not always wrong to kill. There are many justified killings each year by people defending themselves or others. The state's right to seek justice even by killing is sanctioned in law. It is not murder.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Murder is usually morally wrong. Homicide can be justified, I.e times of war, self-defense, capital punishment.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: The state can break the cycle of violence initiated by the murderer by taking a stand against execution, thereby demonstrating that killing is wrong.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Death penalty does not decrease violence in society; in fact, the opposite is the case.
1.1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: States have both the [right and the moral obligation](http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/osjcl/files/2012/04/8.-DeGirolamiFinal-4.24.pdf) to punish offenders, and such punishment is not only intrinsically good or right, but also sufficient to justify punishment.
1.1.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: We can all agree that killing is morally wrong, and in a democracy, such as in the USA, the institutions are a representation of the people, therefore using the capital punishment is a moral fault that has to be carried by the integrality of the population. This is unfair because it makes us all responsible for the murder of someone.
1.1.4.1.2.1.2. Pro: States, where the death penalty is still legal, have [higher murder rates](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/deterrence-states-without-death-penalty-have-had-consistently-lower-murder-rates) than those that have abolished it.
1.1.4.1.2.1.2.1. Con: That does not necessarily contradict the death penalty as a deterrent to murder. It is plausible that states with higher murder rates are motivated by that fact to support stronger anti-crime measures including capital punishment, resulting in reduced gaps between their states and other states.
1.1.4.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Given the death penalty is not being introduced ab initio in the US - rather, there is a trend towards abolition - this is unlikely.
1.1.4.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: This suggests that such places culturally believe violence is an effective method of resolving problems. If someone from such a society feels the law has failed to kill someone worthy of death, they may be tempted to take it upon themselves to do so.
1.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: A similar phenomenon can be seen in the brutal crackdown of drug offenders in the Phillipines, alongside vigilante killings that go unpunished by law enforcement.[Duarte's War on Addicts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atuqx5Ubr5o)
1.1.4.1.2.1.2.3. Pro: [FBI data](https://www.amnestyusa.org/files/pdfs/deathpenaltyfacts.pdf) show that all 14 states without capital punishment in 2008 had homicide rates at or below the national rate.
1.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: In the US more murders take place in states where capital punishment is allowed.
1.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.1.1. Con: The association between a high murder rate and the death penalty does not necessarily speak to the ineffectiveness of capital punishment. The number of murders might be what made the death penalty so necessary, and without it, might have been higher.
1.1.4.1.2.1.2.4. Pro: The death penalty is not a deterrent. The murder rate in states employing the death penalty is up to double that of non-death penalty states. [deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/6287)
1.1.4.1.2.1.2.5. Con: There are sets of states to cherry-pick to support either argument, but that assertion is false because there are many states having a death penalty that are less murderous. For example, the rate per 100,000 in 2016 of murder and non-negligent manslaughter was 5.4, 5.3, 4.9, and 5.5 in FL, TX, CA, and AZ. These have a death penalty statute. In IL, DC, NM, and MD, however, the numbers were 8.2, 20.4, 6.7, and 8. These areas do not have a death penalty statute. [ucr.fbi.gov](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/tables/table-2)
1.1.4.1.2.2. Con: The state already does much to break the cycle of violence by including due process, equality under the law, maintaining a legal monopoly on violence, and other niceties of an impartial system.
1.1.4.1.2.3. Con: If the state accepts that soldiers and police may kill in the course of their duties, then it is hypocritical to claim that killing is inherently wrong.
1.1.4.1.2.3.1. Con: Correct, but hypocrisy exists due to its link to practicality. Sometimes the state \(or any justice seeking system\) will need to do things that are against their believes and still, they need to be done for the greater good.
1.1.4.1.2.4. Pro: The capital punishment is the major demonstration of the state promoting the killing of the human being.
1.1.4.1.3. Con: With death penalty being a legal measure, neither the executer nor the state become criminals by applying it under national legislation.
1.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Legality is a construct of the state. If the state apparatus decides that the death penalty is legal, then in that jurisdiction it is legal.
1.1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: We are debating the morality of capital punishment, not it's legality. A democratic principle is a moral concept, which can \(and should\) influence the making of laws.
1.1.4.1.4. Pro: The person who injects the murderer is himself a murderer.
1.1.5. Con: Justice is a whole topic generates difficult questions. To suggest that we should not act in the face of ethical problems is not pragmatic. Should we incarcerate people at all? To what end, reform or punitive measures ect.
1.1.6. Con: With modern technology, death penalty can and eventually will be more automated than ever.
1.1.6.1. Con: New technologies and automation of execution still require a human being to impose the death penalty upon another human being. Therefore, the ethical difficulties remain.
1.1.6.2. Con: It does not matter whether an individual has to inject a deadly substance or to order an automated execution machine; both actions cause the death of a human being and as such make this individual responsible for this death.
1.1.6.3. Con: Automation only translocates the responsibility from the executer to the engineers and coders.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: A machine used for execution need not be expressly designed for that purpose. Therefore the Engineers and coders would be oblivious and exempt from implicit or explicit responsibility.
1.1.7. Pro: Killing humans is against religion. Only god is able and allowed to judge life.
1.1.7.1. Pro: The [Union for Reform Judaism](https://www.thoughtco.com/branches-of-judaism-reform-2077051), which represents the majority of American Jews, has called for total abolition of the death penalty since 1959.
1.1.7.1.1. Con: The Union for Reform Judaism does not speak for all Jews.
1.1.7.1.2. Con: This position is not rooted in any of the [Rabbinical Laws set forth in the Torah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_and_corporal_punishment_in_Judaism#In_Rabbinic_Law).
1.1.7.2. Pro: Jesus ended the death penalty. "He who is without sin cast the first stone." This means that Jesus gave us instructions that only one without sin can give somebody the penalty of death. The only sinless being in existence is God, and God alone. Jail is the rightful place for dangerous criminals.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: Jesus [did not cast the first stone](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A7-20&version=KJV), thereby disobeying his own command. As such, Jesus should not be viewed as authoritative on the subject.
1.1.7.2.2. Con: Jesus [did not change any of the Abrahamic law](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Matthew%205%3A18).
1.1.7.2.3. Con: The biblical passage in which Jesus says, "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone," [is not original to ancient manuscripts](https://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/complete-interview-with-bart-ehrman/Content?oid=1214629).  The story, which is only found in the Gospel of John, is not found in the oldest manuscripts available.  Arguments against capital punishment should not be based upon forged passages.
1.1.7.2.4. Con: Religious doctrine is not a reasonable foundation for law in the U.S., because our form of government is not a theocracy.
1.1.7.3. Con: Religion is not demonstrably true.
1.1.7.4. Con: Not listening to holy men, being gay, working on Sunday, or not believing are considered [capital offences](http://www.evilbible.com/evil-bible-home-page/murder-in-the-bible/) in the Bible. Christianity has no problem with killing people, as long as they are "the right people".
1.1.7.5. Con: Religion is not objective, nor is there concensus about it on this or any point.
1.1.7.5.1. Pro: [Christians](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/capitalpunishment_1.shtml) continuously argue both for and against capital punishment.
1.1.7.6. Pro: God created life. We as humans, are not qualified to be judges of those who are worthy to keep it or not.
1.1.7.6.1. Con: False premise: god is fictional.
1.1.7.6.1.1. Con: God [exists](https://www.kialo.com/existence-of-god-2629/2629.0=2629.1/=2629.1).
1.1.7.7. Con: Old testament of the Bible says "[one eye for one eye](http://biblereasons.com/eye-for-an-eye/)".
1.1.7.8. Pro: The Bible asserts, “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image." \(Genesis 9:6\) One of the commandments, given to Moses by God tells us, "Thou shall not kill." \(Exodus 20:14\).  God doesn't open any loopholes in said law for "very bad criminals."  When we execute a criminal, we kill the potential for forgiveness and redemption.
1.1.7.9. Pro: The death penalty denies the criminal the time he/she may need to repent and reconcile with God.
1.1.7.10. Con: To say that the Abrahamic religions have a ban on killing humans is risible. From the Christian Crusades and pogroms to modern day Islamic Jihad these religions have been murdering other humans since their inception.
1.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.2.
1.1.9. Con: Only for some specific people who we have mandated be involved in the process. Execution could be carried out by hanging or firing squad by volunteers who would have no ethical qualms.
1.1.9.1. Con: Deferring such a delicate procedure to individuals who might not only claim no qualms but might actively seek the thrill of the occasion is a deeply disturbing prospect.
1.1.10. Pro: The death penalty affects a victim and their families negatively when appeals are filed. Further, some states have automatic appeals in place for death row inmates. These appeals force victims and their families to re-live whatever horrible atrocity they suffered during an appeal process which can span many years. This is akin to torture for these people who have already gone through something horrible. Far better to get rid of the death penalty and leave dangerous people in prison for life.
1.1.11. Con: We are smart enough to negotiate \(for want of a better term\) these many ethical difficulties.
1.1.11.1. Pro: The study of ethics, itself defined either as moral principles that govern a person's behaviour or the conducting of an activity, or the branch of knowledge that deals with moral principles, is sufficiently advanced to enable us to negotiate difficulties generated in death row cases. We need a robust and detailed model of the many ethical issues involved that could be used to derive a solution to each difficulty.
1.2. Con: Some criminals deserve the death penalty due to the severity of their crimes.
1.2.1. Pro: Serious felons \(murderers, terrorists, etc.\) have revoked their right to be part of society through their criminal acts and they deserve to die.
1.2.1.1. Con: Under the cover of combating terrorism mainly the civil rights are being cut. Furthermore a lot of "innocent terrorist suspects" are being tortured to death especially in Guantanamo, but also worldwide.
1.2.1.2. Pro: A murderer deserves death penalty because they have trespassed against the whole society by killing one of its members.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Following that logic a burglar deserves death because he has stolen from a member of society and by that stolen from society.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Everyone in the society feels the gruesome impact of the worst murders. We are all feel the shock and fear the recent Las Vegas shooting, or the story of a serial killer, or a murder/suicide. Our world is more frightening because these horrors are in it, and we don't need to personally know the victim to lose some part of our sense of security to the violence.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: It is not the fact of the murder that changes the perception of risk but the transportation of this via the media. Statistically [the world is getting safer](http://www.npr.org/2016/07/16/486311030/despite-the-headlines-steven-pinker-says-the-world-is-becoming-less-violent) but the fear is rising because of media coverage of crimes.
1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: It's not all about risk. Some of it is about the ugly extremes a tiny fraction of humanity is willing to go to.
1.2.1.2.2.2. Con: By studying the murderers action, we can help keep the event from happening again, making us safer in the long run, as legislators, and law enforcement close the holes that let the murder take place.
1.2.1.2.3. Con: The murderer has not harmed the whole of society by killing one of its members, but has harmed only those immediately affected by the loss of life.
1.2.1.3. Con: Revoking the right to be part of society could be realized by expulsion.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: There are logistical concerns when it comes to moving exiled criminals. It is not clear where they would be sent, for one.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: Expulsing highly dangerous criminals is not a sensible solution.
1.2.1.4. Pro: Your actions have corresponding consequences, protecting someone from the consequences of their own actions is irresponsible and leads to the belief that you can do anything you want without fear of equal retribution.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: By this argument, it would be morally reprehensible to keep a baby from drinking bleach.
1.2.1.4.2. Con: By this argument, it would be morally reprehensible to intervene in an attempted suicide.
1.2.1.4.3. Con: By this argument, it would be morally reprehensible to put up any kind of warning sign, or signal, nor to take safety precautions against personal injury.
1.2.1.4.4. Con: The dead don't learn.
1.2.1.4.4.1. Con: Capital punishment serves as an example to other would-be criminals, to deter them from committing murder or terrorist acts.
1.2.1.4.4.1.1. Con: The death penalty has not decreased crime rates.
1.2.1.4.4.1.2. Pro: When laws are stringent, they act as a severe reminder of consequences of committing a crime, especially among potential criminals.
1.2.1.4.4.1.3. Con: Since criminals committing severe offenses are often [self-destructive](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/10/us/san-bernardino-school-shooting/index.html), the death penalty does not deter them.

In particular, familial murders are often [murder-suicides](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37011767). This is an extremely common form of murder - averaging more than ten a *week* in the US according to a recent [Violence Policy Centre study](http://www.vpc.org/studies/amroul2015.pdf). That's more than a thousand victims a year murdered by people who then immediately commit suicide.

If a killer is planning suicide, the death penalty is no deterrent.
1.2.1.4.4.1.4. Con: There are more effective ways to deter would-be criminals than execution.
1.2.1.4.4.1.4.1. Pro: Life in prison with little freedom and poor quality of life is a better punishment and deterrent to criminals than death row.
1.2.1.4.4.1.5. Con: Crimes punished by death \(e.g. terrorist acts\) are in most cases thought through before and carried out despite the risk of prosecution or in awareness of it.
1.2.1.4.4.1.5.1. Pro: Many terrorists expect, and plan, to die committing their crime.  The prospect of possibly being sentenced to die years later is hardly going to deter them.
1.2.1.4.4.1.6. Con: The number of death sentences executed is too low as to be able to count as a deterrence against the high number of committed murders.
1.2.1.4.4.1.6.1. Pro: [According to FBI figures](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/tables/table-11), there were 16,470 murders in the US in 2016, and well over a million violent crimes generally.

For comparison, the US executed 20 people in 2016.

So even a murderer faces less than 0.15% chance of execution.
1.2.1.5. Con: Murderers and terrorists are people who have decided they have the power to decide who "deserves to die". How do you condemn them for taking that power, while taking it upon yourself? By definition, capital punishment is murder, and it's hypocritical to endorse one murder when you get to decide the victims, and not when someone else does.
1.2.1.5.1. Con: It is not merely whether a determination is made that someone deserves to die that determines whether our conscience is offended. It is mostly in how that determination is made. If it is determined unilaterally, without oversight or a fair hearing of arguments in defense, our offense has greater justification. An unaccountable terrorist killing people he doesn't even know without warning offends conscience to a much greater extent than an execution for cause by an impartial system.
1.2.1.5.2. Con: [Murder is defined](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murder) as "the crime of unlawfully killing a person." [Execution is defined](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/execution) as "a putting to death especially as a legal penalty." Putting to death as a legal penalty is mutually exclusive with unlawfully killing a person. Execution is by definition a [homicide](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/homicide), "a killing of one human being by another."
1.2.1.6. Con: The human right to life is [universal and inalienable](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/); even the worst offenders cannot be deprived of this right.
1.2.1.6.1. Pro: If [human life](https://tragicfarce.com/tag/immanuel-kant/) is the most precious thing, then letting a murderer live is morally acceptable since doing so protects from further loss of life.
1.2.1.6.1.1. Con: Letting a murderer live does not protect against further loss of life. Unless the life you hope to protect is that of the murderer you are jeopardizing human life.
1.2.1.6.2. Pro: A state should not have the power to either give life or take away somebody’s life.
1.2.1.6.2.1. Con: A state has the responsibility to ensure safety for the citizens in the country.
1.2.1.6.2.1.1. Con: The state can protect its citizens independent of whether or not it has the power to conduct executions.
1.2.1.6.2.1.2. Pro: A permanent threat to society can only be eliminated through execution.
1.2.1.6.2.1.3. Con: As a norm the least restrictive measure should be used. That is not execution.
1.2.1.6.2.2. Pro: If governments were empowered to choose which people in society were valuable and execute them accordingly, it would likely lead to major human rights abuses of minorities and the targeted elimination of political opponents.
1.2.1.6.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.1.1.
1.2.1.6.2.4. Pro: There is a [categorical imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative#The_Second_Formulation:_The_Formula_of_Humanity) not to kill people. This applies to evil people as much as the rest of us. If you don't believe in murder you shouldn't ordain state murder.
1.2.1.6.2.4.1. Con: Capital punishment does not stringently violate the categorical imperative \(Kant\): A fair court procedure, and an appropriate sentence depending on the severity of the committed crime can very well be principles for [universal law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative#The_Second_Formulation:_The_Formula_of_Humanity).
1.2.1.6.2.4.1.1. Con: Fair court procedures that meet Kant's requirements have never existed in the US. In Kant's formulation, a court system that fails to punish violations of the law is weak therefor illegitimate, and a system that punishes the innocent is worthless and unable to establish guilt.
1.2.1.6.2.4.1.2. Con: For capital punishment to be supported by the categorical imperative, there must be a crime severe enough to justify the death penalty.
1.2.1.6.2.4.1.3. Con: For capital punishment to be supported by the death penalty, a reason for responsive punishments must be shown to follow good will.
1.2.1.6.2.5. Con: Prisoners [do not have full constitutional rights](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/prisoners_rights). Therefore, the government should have the right to decide what to do with you.
1.2.1.6.2.5.1. Con: Not having "full constitutional rights" does not equal having no rights at all. Prisoners are in fact still protected by the 8th Amendment \(which arguably challenges the concept of capital punishment\).
1.2.1.6.2.5.2. Con: Some of these revoked constitutional rights \(like the right to vote\) are also subject to social critique and debate. Their mere existence does not validate capital punishment to be a part of them.
1.2.1.6.2.6. Con: This would include abortion laws as well, which are regarded as a right-to-life-issue.
1.2.1.6.2.6.1. Con: Abortion is not conducted by the state. Thus it cannot be compared.
1.2.1.6.2.7. Pro: The state should not be involved in premeditated killing.
1.2.1.6.3. Con: Murderers have not respected the value of the lives of others, therefore it is just to end their lives.
1.2.1.6.3.1. Pro: Murderers don't agree human life is valuable, due to the nature of their crime, and therefore they can not defend the value of their own lives without being in a contradiction.
1.2.1.6.4. Con: The government should prioritize the interests of all persons in society. Therefore, the value of murderer's life and experience should not be protected if it jeopardizes the safety of others.
1.2.1.6.4.1. Pro: It is wrong for the interests of an individual who has proven to be dangerous to society to overrule the interest of society in protecting itself from that individual
1.2.1.6.5. Con: Human life has no specific, objective value. It is valuated differently by any number of philosophical, spiritual, and ethical ideologies.
1.2.1.6.5.1. Con: Barring evidence to the contrary, it is generally safe to assume most of these value human life pretty highly, if not equally.
1.2.1.6.6. Con: Removing the ultimate punishment \(death\) for the ultimate crime \(homicide\) cheapens the value of human life.
1.2.1.6.6.1. Con: Lower murder rates in non-death penalty nations show that murder rates have less to do with the value of human life than the general morality that exists within any one society.
1.2.1.6.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.1.2.
1.2.1.6.7. Con: There are many reasonable circumstances in which it is acceptable to deliberately ignore someone's right to life, such as in war. Therefore, there is no absolute right to life, only a conditional right depending on the circumstances. If someone commits an egregious offense, their right to life should not be considered absolute.
1.2.1.6.7.1. Con: In every scenario where it is acceptable to deliberately ignore someone's right to life, one only does so to directly ensure someone else's right to life. The death penalty does not adhere to this criterium.
1.2.1.6.7.1.1. Con: War does not adhere to this criterium, yet it is justified if there is sufficient purpose.
1.2.1.6.7.1.2. Con: If the death penalty leads to a more just society due to the deterrent effect of preventing future crimes or the spectacular effect of defining what is evil and reinforcing moral norms, then it will ensure fewer deaths and injustices in the future. Depending on these benefits, it could be said to adhere to this criterium.
1.2.1.6.7.2. Pro: A person's right to life is conditional.  For example in the case of self-defense, one's right to life is forfeit if one attacks another person and threaten's their life i.e. one's right to life is conditional upon one's actions.  It is logical to extend this conditional principal beyond the individual to many individuals or society, which means that capital punishment is not necessarily a violation of human rights if there is sufficient justification.
1.2.1.6.8. Con: -> See 1.2.1.6.7.2.
1.2.1.6.9. Con: Moral philosophy justifies capital punishment under certain preconditions.
1.2.1.6.9.1. Pro: [Immanuel Kant](http://tragicfarce.com/tag/immanuel-kant/) said that a society that is not willing to demand a life of somebody who has taken somebody else's life is simply immoral.
1.2.1.6.9.1.1. Con: This is an [appeal to authority](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority); Immanuel Kant saying so does not, by itself, make it so. Particularly in this case, where his opinion on the death penalty was exactly that - an opinion.  He failed to back it up by construction from the system of ethics he developed - a system from which one can rationally argue exactly the opposite position just as easily.
1.2.1.6.9.1.1.1. Con: Not many people are familiar with Kant's work today unless they specifically know about the theory of human dignity, so this 'appeal to authority' would not be very effective.
1.2.1.6.9.1.1.1.1. Con: It's hard to prove a negative, all that can be really said to support this is personal experience.
1.2.1.6.9.1.1.2. Con: An appeal to authority is only fallacious if it has not been demonstrated that the person is not an authority on the subject. Immanuel Kant is a noted philosopher.
1.2.1.6.9.1.1.2.1. Con: On the contrary, an appeal to authority is useless when there is no expert consensus. In this case, the expert is from over two hundred years ago and specialized in metaphysics, long before we had empirical studies of criminal behavior or sociology. Not to mention that the vast majority of his philosophy has been taken in different directions by subsequent philosophers.
1.2.1.6.9.1.1.2.1.1. Con: We still use Hypocrisies when we speak of the Hippocratic oath, even though we have changed it very greatly, even reversing some parts of his oath, like the right to know, times have changed, but he, like Kant, is still an authority.
1.2.1.6.9.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: This is true, but it was never argued that Kant is not an expert. That medicine \(and the oath\) has changed in the two millennia since the Hippocratic corpus was assembled only furthers the point that one cannot merely quote the name of an expert from the past to prove what should be done in the present \(which is what the original appeal to authority did\).
1.2.1.6.9.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The [original argument](https://www.kialo.com/capital-punishment-in-the-us-inhumane-or-just-801/801.0=801.1-801.1441+801.1504+801.1509+801.142-801.1715) is indeed not proof, but it still has weight, it is still something to consider, although other factors, like different moral systems, various facts, or even different interpretations of Kant's moral system, could outweigh the importance of that point, the point is still a valid one to make.
1.2.1.6.9.1.1.2.2. Pro: Kant is an authority on ethics: He established the influential and reputable [Kantian ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantian_ethics).
1.2.1.6.9.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Kant was an expert on one particular branch of ethical philosophy when he wrote the Metaphysics of Morals \(1775\): [deontological ethics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/#DeoTheKan) \(see 2.4\). Some other ethical approaches: [virtue ethics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/), [consequentialism/utilitarianism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/), and [metaethics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaethics/), with their own subcategories. A simple reading through the above links will show that there is no expert consensus, and that the field has developed significantly in the two hundred years since Kant. It would be misguided to cite him as the final word.
1.2.1.6.9.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: This is true, and a very valuable point, but even though these thinkers did not agree, they did not ignore each other's work either, in fact, Kant's work was, in part, a response to some of these theories.
1.2.1.6.9.1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Kant does not need to be the end all be all to be an authority, it is hard to think of a time when anyone should be treated as the end all be all authority.
1.2.1.6.9.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: [Kant](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/625356?id=625356) is even used to represent this philosophy in video games, speaking on it as an authority.
1.2.1.6.9.1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Kant has many philosophical views. Being used in a video game is irrelevant to one's status as an authority, and merely demonstrates popularity.
1.2.1.6.9.1.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: In this case, his popularity in connection with the development of prominent moral philosophies, so it does help a bit.
1.2.1.6.9.1.1.3. Con: Although this somewhat goes against the grain of Kant's theory of intent instead of consequences, he did have a method for evaluating morality, the [categorical imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative).
1.2.1.6.9.1.2. Con: Although Kant might have felt that way, it's hard to support killing innocent people under his philosophy.
1.2.1.6.9.1.3. Con: Most sane people would agree that killing a helpless person is bad, these people, using [Kant's philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantian_ethics) would argue that is enough grounds to say it's always bad, and even if you can find a case where it might provide some benefit, the rule should stick.
1.2.1.6.9.1.4. Pro: Kant said: "However many they may be who have committed a murder, or have even commanded it, or acted as art and part in it, they ought all to suffer death; for so justice wills it,"  [\(Science of Right \(1790\) by Immanuel Kant\)](http://www1.american.edu/dgolash/Kant_on_Punishment.htm)
1.2.1.6.9.1.5. Con: Kant's own ethical system has some controversial issues: the most well-noted is that were a murderer to show up at your house looking for an intended victim that you were hiding, you would [not be allowed to lie to the murderer](https://philpapers.org/rec/KANOAS-2) \(even though your silence would be an admission\). Hence subsequent philosophers have had to reconcile this with the rest of his ethics.
1.2.1.6.9.1.5.1. Con: Every moral philosophy, at least, ever one humans could create is flawed, this does not by any means make them useless.
1.2.1.6.9.1.6. Con: This argument in no way accounts for cases of self defense or accidents. An abused woman should not be put to death for defending herself from harm. The argument becomes irrelevant to justice if it is not to be applied to every case.
1.2.1.6.9.1.6.1. Con: The assumption herein is that all laws apply evenly to all crimes, which is obviously not true.  We know and accept that not all crimes are the same and that not all punishments are delivered equally.
1.2.1.6.9.1.7. Con: This does not account for the people who carry out the death penalty. With this absolutist philosophy, the executioner's life is also forfeit.
1.2.1.6.9.1.7.1. Con: I think society elects to give a free pass to executioners, delaying their punishment until after death, which conveniently accomplishes the same objective. This is why we don't blink at folks who [kill out of self defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-your-ground_law), or protection of societies during warfare.
1.2.1.6.9.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.6.1.
1.2.1.6.9.3. Pro: According to [Jeremy Bentham](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bentham/#PenLawPun), capital punishment is morally acceptable, as it benefits society and provides safety for many to the cost of few criminals: The happiness of many outweighs the suffering of a very small number of individuals.
1.2.1.6.9.3.1. Con: Mob happiness is no justice. Consider a thought experiment where an angry townspeople demand the burning of a "witch". If she is burned for her supposed crimes, the townspeople are very happy. However, she is obviously innocent.
1.2.1.6.9.3.2. Con: The are too many variables and and human life is too subjective an experience to measure unit happiness from each participant in this equation. Is the limitation of my freedom equal to the happiness aroused in one other by my incarceration? Two others? Three others and so on.
1.2.1.6.9.4. Con: Allowing the death penalty expresses a moral maxim that seems to contend with the moral maxim of "it is wrong to kill"
1.2.1.6.9.5. Con: Murder is illegal because it is morally wrong. Murdering a murderer suggests that murder is not, in fact, morally wrong, and therefore, the offender is being held to a different societal standard as a result of his/her actions.
1.2.1.6.9.5.1. Con: Killing is separate from murder. Murder is specifically illegal killing. Ethically/morally, there is still a difference. Usually delineated by whether or not a killing was justified \(i.e. cold-blooded vs self-defense\).
1.2.1.7. Pro: Punishment should reflect the crime. In the case of many crimes, the victims' rights can be restored and later the criminal can have his rights back. In the case of murder, since the victim can never have rights back, the criminal must be deprived of his life as punishment. He/she can never have their rights back either.
1.2.1.8. Con: Losing the right to be part of society comprises such rights as the right of freedom or the right to vote. One cannot lose the most basic right: the right to life.
1.2.1.8.1. Con: Once someone violates an individuals right to life they forfeit their rights, so they deserve the death penalty.
1.2.1.8.2. Con: Losing one's civil also includes protection under the law. Thus society also gives up the responsibility to protect your life.
1.2.1.8.3. Pro: The nature of human rights is that they must apply to all humans. They are unconditional, and among those rights is the right to life.
1.2.1.8.4. Con: The right to life can be forfeited by severe criminals who commit atrocious crimes such as child murders or torture murders. [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_murder)
1.2.1.9. Con: Crimes--unless treasonous--do not revoke an American's citizenship, which guarantees them certain unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
1.2.1.9.1. Con: Prison itself is a restriction on liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and people don't think that prison is unnecessary. Thus, punishment for crimes aren't obligated to maintain the unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.6.9.
1.2.3. Pro: The retributive philosophy of an "eye for an eye" is the most just form of punishment.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Retributive punishment is one of the oldest forms of justice, and has historically been accepted by societies as necessary.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.6.9.1.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: Being old and historically-accepted doesn't make it moral or just.
1.2.3.2. Pro: It is the only efficient way to obtain retribution on behalf of the victims.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: One of the main principles of punishment and the judicial system is that the penalty fits the crime.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: Punishment is not supposed to equal the crime, but to make amends for society.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: The purpose of criminal punishment is not to enact vengeance, and such an attitude should not be advocated for.
1.2.3.2.1.2. Con: The death penalty delivers a 'double punishment'; that of the execution  and the preceding wait in jail. This a mismatch to the crime.
1.2.3.2.1.2.1. Con: As a recent case shows, keeping convicts on death row for a long time ensures possible acquittal after evidence is produced for their innocence. The case also shows, how easily innocent men can be sentenced to murder, given certain unfavorable circumstances. \([nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/us/2-convicted-in-1983-north-carolina-murder-freed-after-dna-tests.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&bicmp=AD&bicmlukp=WT.mc_id&bicmst=1409232722000&bicmet=1419773522000&_r=1)\)
1.2.3.2.1.3. Pro: If someone violently murders another individual or numerous people, then it makes sense for the punishment to be death.
1.2.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: If the crime is deemed worthy of capital punishment by jurors, then it would be wrong for some third-party to arbitrarily bar that form of punishment, because jurors are whom determine what penalty fits the crime.
1.2.3.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Jurors and their sentencing are subject to the Rule of Law, and if laws ban capital punishment, they are in no position to sentence it.
1.2.3.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Many types of punishment are banned by law.
1.2.3.2.1.3.2. Con: An eye for eye mentality is anachronistic.
1.2.3.2.1.4. Con: If the crime is murder and the penalty is death, then the State is no different from the murderer since they both committed the same act: taking the life of another. Life is either sacrosanct or not, regardless of whether the punishment supposedly fits the crime.
1.2.3.2.1.4.1. Pro: If an individual does not have the right to determine who should die \(murder is always illegal\), then the State should not be granted that right either.
1.2.3.2.2. Con: There can be no restitution provided to the victim or their family if the criminal is executed.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: There is no possibility of acquiring financial aid from the criminal if they are executed, whereas life imprisonment includes the possibility of the criminal working from prison, etc.
1.2.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Financial compensation is an insufficient form of restitution for a victim of violent crime, or the victim's family.
1.2.3.2.2.1.2. Con: It is legal in the USA for prisoners to be forced to work without pay as part of their punishment, and not all prisoners have access to any work. A living prisoner is no guarantee of financial aid.
1.2.3.2.2.1.3. Con: A prisoner's will may be of some financial benefit to the family.
1.2.3.2.2.2. Con: There is no reason for restitution to be provided to the family if the criminal is executed.
1.2.3.2.3. Con: Death penalty provides insufficient retribution. While life imprisonment without parole causes much more suffering to the offender than a painless death after a short period of imprisonment.
1.2.3.2.4. Con: Retribution, designed to re-establish justice, can easily be distinguished from vengeance and vindictiveness.
1.2.3.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.1.1.
1.2.3.2.4.2. Pro: Retribution is used in a unique way in the case of the death penalty. Crimes other than murder do not receive a punishment that mimics the crime, e.g. rapists are not punished by sexual assault.
1.2.3.2.4.3. Pro: The idea of punishment as revenge is antiquated. Modern penal systems aim at ways for felons to repay the damage done to society.
1.2.3.2.4.3.1. Con: This affirmation does not support the previous. You have to show why revenge mentality don't advance society.
1.2.3.2.4.3.2. Pro: [Finnish prisons](https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-04-15/finlands-open-prisons-inmates-have-keys) without gates and guards have a track record of being highly efficient.
1.2.3.2.4.3.2.1. Con: That depends entirely on one's definition of "efficiency". I see nothing to suggest they're effective at deterring crime or at rehabilitating.
1.2.3.2.4.3.2.2. Con: That would obviously not work in the US.
1.2.3.2.4.3.3. Con: There is no evidence that punishment as revenge is antiquated. Nor is there any individual or institutional authority who can independently assert it to be antiquated.  So it is not antiquated.
1.2.3.2.4.3.4. Con: ‘Antiquated’ does not necessarily mean ‘wrong’. An antiquated concept could be wrong but it’s wrongness may or may not have anything to do with how old it is.
1.2.3.2.4.3.5. Con: The felon arrested for murder / rape / etc. can never actually repay the damage done to society.
1.2.3.2.4.3.5.1. Con: However, little the felon can do to repair the damage, it is more than they will accomplish if they are executed.
1.2.3.2.5. Pro: The death of a criminal gives closure to the victim's families.
1.2.3.2.5.1. Con: Although this is a common conception, empirical studies show that victims' families do not actually get peace or closure from the death of the criminal.
1.2.3.2.5.1.1. Pro: [20% of victims' families](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18064972)explicitly reported that the sentence of capital punishment did not bring them closure.
1.2.3.2.5.1.2. Pro: [A study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19025285) on revenge showed that while people expect to feel better for exacting revenge on an offender, in reality those who do not call for punishment move on faster than those who do.
1.2.3.2.5.1.3. Pro: [A study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18064972) showed that only 2.5% of victims' families reported feeling a sense of closure after the perpetrator had been sentenced to capital punishment.
1.2.3.2.5.2. Con: If society was really worried about closure, it would actively provide free long-term mental health care and other services to the families of murder victims, instead of vengeance.
1.2.3.2.5.2.1. Con: Some victims services organizations do this already.
1.2.3.2.5.3. Con: Not all people affected by murder crimes demand death penalty for their perpetrators.
1.2.3.2.5.3.1. Pro: A lot of personally [affected people](http://www.californiacrimevictims.org/), such as victims families, oppose the death penalty.
1.2.3.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: [A poll](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/04/26/globe-poll-shows-diminishing-support-for-death-penalty-for-tsarnaev/S3GMhFlGj5VUkZrmLzh1iN/story.html) showed that 85% of Boston residents, including the parents of an 8-year old who died in the attack, did not want the perpetrator responsible for the Boston marathon bombing to be given the death penalty.
1.2.3.2.5.3.2. Pro: Many family members who have lost loved ones to murder feel that the death penalty will not heal their wounds nor will it end their pain; the death penalty can actually [prolong](http://www.deathpenalty.org/article.php?id=56) the agony experienced by the victims' families.
1.2.3.2.5.3.2.1. Pro: Many offenders are kept 'waiting' on death row for a very long time. In the US the average wait is [10 years.](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/time-death-row)
1.2.3.2.5.3.2.1.1. Con: This is an argument against death row rather than the death penalty specifically. It is possible to have a death penalty and to have a very short window between sentencing and execution. This was commonly how the death penalty was enacted across much of Europe during the 2nd Millenium. Indeed, the contemporary American system where the convicted spend decades on death row is a historical anomaly.
1.2.3.2.5.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The very short window between sentencing and execution vastly increases the likelihood of an innocent person being executed for a crime they are later exonerated of.
1.2.3.2.5.3.2.2. Pro: The death penalty process is a traumatizing experience for families, often requiring them to relive the pain and suffering of the death of their loved one for many years.
1.2.3.2.5.3.3. Con: [But](http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/07/akron_child_killer_ronald_phil_1.html) [some](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/24/us/arkansas-execution-victims-families/index.html) [do](https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/victims-family-emotional-after-ohio-child-killer-executed/).
1.2.3.2.5.3.3.1. Con: [The Akron man's death by lethal injection Wednesday was "too easy"​](http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/07/akron_child_killer_ronald_phil_1.html)["We couldn't move on and have that closure because they \(the state\) wouldn't let us," Jones, 38 of Little Rock, Arkansas, said Sunday. "It's like they trapped us ... thinking about it and going to clemency hearings, and telling them one more time 'Yes, we still want you to finish this.' "](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/24/us/arkansas-execution-victims-families/index.html),when said out loud, these statements sound horrible.
1.2.3.2.5.3.3.2. Con: This appears to be a small amount of the population of victims families, a small number of the total population are murderers, maybe we are seeing the murderers who's victims just happen to also be murderers.
1.2.3.2.5.4. Con: The death penalty instills vengeance disguised as closure.
1.2.3.2.5.5. Con: At the same time, it gives grief and suffering to the criminals' family.
1.2.3.2.5.5.1. Con: Parents apparently made mistakes in educating the child. For their failure an individual had to die. They have to suffer as well.
1.2.3.2.5.5.1.1. Con: Implying that the only form of education and nurture a person gets is through his/her parents, and therefore are entirely to blame for his/her actions, is simplistic and outright false.
1.2.3.2.5.5.1.2. Con: Family does not only include parents. Possible children, siblings, or other aspects of family would suffer as well.
1.2.3.2.5.5.2. Con: In some cases, the criminals' actions have distanced them sufficiently from the family that the family favors execution or is neutral on the matter. The execution of family annihilation killers commonly do not offend the family, for example.
1.2.3.2.6. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.2.3.2.7. Pro: One of the foremost responsibilities of government is to enforce justice. Mistakes and faulty systems are not a reason to forego justice. When the sanctity of human life is violated, it is not revenge, but the need of an equal to satisfy justice. The only equal to a life taken by the accused, is to give their life.
1.2.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.2.
1.2.3.4. Con: Society must move away from a mentality of revenge if civilization is to advance.
1.2.3.4.1. Con: While this argument holds a strong emotional appeal, civilization has continued to advance throughout a mentality of revenge. History conflicts with this argument.
1.2.3.4.1.1. Con: History only shows what has happened, not what should. It's not enough to simply say "we've done it before, we should keep doing it" but rather the efficacy of any policies should be proven to be considered for continuation. This hasn't happened with Capital Punishment. An act in and of itself is no proof that it works.
1.2.3.4.2. Con: Many supporters of capital punishment don't have a mentality of revenge. Many see it as more of a prophylactic against the most heinous crimes.
1.2.3.4.2.1. Con: Basing punishments on crimes that have not yet been committed is unjust.
1.2.3.4.3. Con: It is not clear what kind of advance this claim talks about, it makes some sense only if is a moral kind.
1.2.3.4.4. Pro: Justice should not look and feel like revenge.
1.2.3.4.4.1. Con: Your feelings or perceptions of capital punishment do not demonstrate either its intent or its effects.
1.2.3.4.5. Con: This is a statement of opinion with no stated facts to back it up.
1.2.3.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.4.3.
1.2.3.5. Con: The lack of any tangible, objective measurement for "justness" means that this claim is subject to individual interpretation, and only represents one possible opinion, rather than a reasonable claim.
1.2.3.6. Con: There are many 'eye for an eye' comments and retributive ideas; these ideas fail to consider the reality that, in consideration with psychology, there are a lot of offenders \(regardless of severity\), who[suffer from mental illness](http://www.livestrong.com/article/99456-causes-sociopathic-behavior/). If one considers the ideas of antisocial and other Cluster B behaviors, as well as sociopaths, you will see that a lot of people who commit crimes that can result in death penalty were once victims themselves, often of abuse.
1.2.3.6.1. Con: This would imply that those that suffer from mental illness, whether formally diagnosed or not, should be pardoned or serve lesser punishment.
1.2.3.7. Con: An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth leaves the world blind, and toothless. One person wrongs another, and on their behalf, a new wrong is commented right back, and soon you've got a feud like the [Montagues and Capulets](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/romeo_juliet/full.html) [Hatfields and McCoys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield%E2%80%93McCoy_feud). It's hard to imagine an outcome so detrimental to everyone could be the result of morality or justice.
1.2.3.7.1. Con: The state's legal monopoly on violence breaks the cycle by allowing no retribution. There is no person to enact revenge against, only an impartial system.
1.2.3.7.1.1. Con: It puts a layer of distance up, but many who feel wronged, or that the system is not impartial, will still find targets. The person they believe accused them, the arresting officer, the judge, the jury, the person they think bribed any of the above.
1.2.3.7.2. Con: This claim presupposes that the act of punish does not bring justice by supposing that the punishment is wrong. An Euclidean principle can be used "if something can be claimed without proof, than it can be refuted without proof" so a refute your supposition that punishment is wrong.
1.2.3.7.2.1. Con: Punishment is wrong, because it achieves no goal, in fact, as was just shown, it instigates more violence, and hurts people.
1.2.3.7.2.1.1. Con: This claim relies on the claim that punishment achieves no goal, that is false, since for a non empty set of individuals to punish is an objective itself in pursuit justice in certain cases. For these individuals to punish is a necessary condition to achieve their primary objective, justice. Then it is a secondary objective.
1.2.3.7.2.1.2. Pro: As you can not teach a children to not beat other by beating they, you can not punish violence by violence.
1.2.3.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.7.2.1.
1.2.3.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.7.
1.2.3.9. Con: Capital punishment is a contradictory form of justice. The government is basically punishing the culprit with the same offence the culprit committed to start with. Role of the government should be to educate, regulate and be an example for its own citizens, not be a source for revenge.
1.2.3.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.4.
1.2.3.9.2. Pro: It is oxymoronic to claim that killing people under the guise of justice proves that killing people is wrong.
1.2.3.10. Pro: If it is true that retribution is unjust, than it must be true that a criminal is justified in arguing against a retributive punishment. One can not be justified in arguing if it is in a contradiction. All criminals are in contradiction, given that to argue against an equivalent act he or she would have to defend that the act itself is unjust, therefore a contradiction due to both acts being equivalent [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_contradiction). Therefore they are not justified in arguing a retributive punishment.
1.2.3.11. Con: Often murder is considered a crime deserving of capital punishment. This is essentially Hammurabi’s code. If we write our laws with an equal punishment for equal crime model, does that mean we should have the state rape rapists? Or beat perpetrators of assault? If this seems assanine, how can one then justify murder for murder?
1.2.3.12. Con: The "[eye for and eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_for_an_eye)" rule was intended to restrict retributive violence to put a final point to it, not to establish a just form of punishment.
1.2.3.13. Con: A retributive justice system can only last so long against the deluge of science concerning the brain, its development, and how we make decisions. If there was a pill that magically removed someone's murderous tendencies forever and had 0 side effects, capital punishment would be totally obsolete.
1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.
1.2.5. Con: Morality is ever-changing, thus we cannot trust today's execution-worthy offense to be tomorrow's.
1.2.5.1. Con: People's views on morality change, but that's not proof that moral imperatives change.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: It's people's views of morality that make up moral imperatives. Moral imperatives are not immutable.
1.2.5.2. Con: Murder is the most consistently condemned crime across a broad variety of cultures and eras. Societal condemnation of it is not likely to change.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: The parent claim is not suggesting we are suddenly going to allow murder, but that the penalty for that crime may change, as we start to think of capital retributions as immoral
1.2.5.3. Pro: The state can't legitimately decide morality and shouldn't engage in revenge killing.
1.2.5.3.1. Con: Innumerable laws \(from those governing animal cruelty to insider trading\) clearly punish offenders based on their moral misconduct. Thus, governments already decide what is moral and what is not and punish their citizens accordingly.
1.2.6. Con: That a criminal deserves to die is necessary to justify capital punishment, but not sufficient. It may be the case that a criminal really does deserve to die, but there are still good reasons not to kill them, for example, it might be very expensive.

So even if we accept unconditionally that some criminals deserve to die that does not prove that it is a wise idea or a good use of public funds to kill criminals. It merely proves that it would not be immoral to kill them.
1.2.6.1. Pro: The financial cost of putting people to death, considering extra appeals, additional procedures etc, can often be more than the cost of putting a criminal in prison for life.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Appeals procedures and additional, often complicated, requirements for death penalty cases clog the court system.
1.2.6.1.1.1. Pro: [North Carolina's Racial Justice Act](http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/8086772/) enables persons charged with a crime that could lead to capital punishment to raise a claim of racial bias, which slackens court procedures.
1.2.6.1.1.2. Pro: As the example of [Montana](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/new-voices-death-penalty-too-expensive-overburdened-courts) shows, death penalty cases are very complicated: Double the number of attorneys and experts are involved, the jury selection process is very time-consuming and more working hours are spent for preparation than for other cases. Once the sentence has passed, appeals can prolongate for many years and keep the courts busy.
1.2.6.1.1.3. Pro: [A new study](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty-cases-colorado-take-six-times-longer-life-sentences) of the cost of the death penalty in Colorado revealed that capital proceedings require six times more days in court and take much longer to resolve than life-without-parole \(LWOP\) cases.
1.2.6.1.2. Pro: In 2000, the Oregon Department of Administrative Services found that the Oregon Judicial Department alone would save [$2.3 million a year](https://oadp.org/facts/13-reasons) if the death penalty were eliminated.
1.2.6.1.3. Pro: Across the country, seeking the death penalty imposes an average of [approximately $700,000 more](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty) in case-level costs than not seeking death.
1.2.6.1.4. Pro: It is a known fact that it costs more to execute someone than for them to live life in prison. 3x as much to execute them\(in the state of Texas\), rather than keeping them alive. Considering that Texas has the highest numbers of executions, it would be a fair assessment to say it doesn't make fiscal sense to kill them. [madpmo.org](http://www.madpmo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DP-Costs-Texas.pdf)
1.2.6.1.5. Pro: Capital punishment statistically costs more to administer, in terms of lost legal precidents, safety precautions, and administrative process.

The study counted death penalty case costs through to execution and found that the median death penalty case costs $1.26 million. Non-death penalty cases were counted through to the end of incarceration and were found to have a median cost of $740,000- [deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty)
1.2.6.1.6. Con: To put someone in jail for 50 years costs around [$3 million](http://www.prodeathpenalty.com/dp.html) while an execution after 6 years on the death row costs $1.8 million; both including trial and appeal expenses.
1.2.6.1.6.1. Con: The costs of executions and life imprisonments differ by state, though conservative numbers across the nation recognize that each execution costs at least [$1 million more](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2014/05/01/considering-the-death-penalty-your-tax-dollars-at-work/&refURL=&referrer=) than a sentence of life imprisonment.
1.2.6.1.6.2. Con: To put someone in jail for 50 years is a poor basis of comparison, since it greatly exceeds the *average* life sentence. \(A 50 year term would require someone to commit their capital offence at an age of around 20 - very rare.\)

To pick a state at random, [Florida reports](http://www.dc.state.fl.us/oth/deathrow/) an average age at time of capital offence of about 28, with age at execution averaging around 45.

So life incarceration by no means costs an extra 50 years of jail costs; it's closer to 20-30.
1.2.6.1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.5.3.2.1.
1.2.6.1.7. Pro: The greatest costs associated with the death penalty occur prior to and during trial, not in post-conviction proceedings. Even if all post-conviction proceedings \(appeals\) were abolished, the death penalty would still be more expensive than alternative sentences.
1.2.6.1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.3.
1.2.6.1.7.2. Pro: Defending a death penalty case costs about four times as much as  defending a case where the death penalty is not sought, according to a new study by the Kansas Judicial Council.
1.2.7. Con: There is no means to objectively define which circumstances warrant death and which do not.
1.2.7.1. Pro: Some criminals do indeed deserve to die, however, no person, or government is ultimately capable of making that judgement.
1.2.7.2. Pro: Even the worst criminals are byproducts of genetics, psychological development, and chance circumstances. Justifying punishment assumes on the part of the criminal a magical agency to transcend the factors that caused them to commit their crimes.
1.2.7.2.1. Con: This argument is only valid under the assertion that one believes free will is an illusion. Since there is no definitive answer to whether free will is true or not, it is sufficient to say that one cannot use it to justify capital punishment or vice versa.
1.2.7.3. Con: Governments create laws to encourage good behavior and discourage bad behavior. Part of discouraging bad behavior is making laws to punish people after the crime has been committed. It is a society's role to determine the severity of the punishments. Society is the objective moral arbiter.
1.2.8. Pro: To say that the death penalty is never acceptable is to say that a person who has raped and murdered small children deserves to live. This is morally abominable.
1.2.8.1. Con: What is the least crime for which the death penalty can be implemented? Why is it different from a crime slightly less bad not also included? If we keep at it in this fashion, we should find either all crimes deserving of death, or none of them.
1.2.8.2. Con: While extremely unacceptable behavior of that sort is terrible and all related words, life imprisonment with absolutely no possibility of parole is arguably a worse sentence.
1.2.8.3. Con: This argument is an [appeal to emotion](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/29/Appeal-to-Emotion).
1.2.9. Pro: Putting a criminal to death for the atrocious he/she committed can help victims and their relatives "heal". If you or your family go through such a traumatic episode in your life, it must be incomprehensible to find out that the person who harmed you might walk free again if he behaves well in prison etc... Being able to forgive such things is a gift, there is no shame in wanting proper justice \(very subjective term\) and not being ever ready to forgive.
1.2.9.1. Con: The "healing" benefits that vengeance might have does not make it any more moral, or just.
1.2.10. Con: Some may argue that living a life without freedom is more of a punishment than death.
1.2.10.1. Pro: Conscience is innate, and even the worst criminal can eventually realise what they have done. Forcing someone to live with a crime on their conscience can often be a more terrible punishment than death.
1.2.10.2. Pro: The assumption that a penalty of death is more extreme than a penalty of life imprisonment is, itself, arguable. From a secular humanist perspective, death is no more than an escape from a prolonged state of suffering. From this perspective, life imprisonment actually has the potential to be more punitive, and execution would therefore serve no logical purpose as the paramount penalty.
1.2.10.2.1. Con: Even if life in prison were more punitive, which is unclear, the pursuit of justice has on its basic principles the principle of equivalence, therefore, it is not true that death penalty would have no logical purpose in this context.
1.2.11. Con: There are irrevocable consequences to execution, such as wrongful conviction.
1.2.11.1. Pro: The execution of an innocent person in light of exculpatory evidence is [not necessarily a violation of constitutional protections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrera_v._Collins). If innocent people are not protected by the 8th amendment under a writ of habeus corpus then ultimately we should get rid of the death penalty as it cannot be just.
1.2.11.1.1. Con: Just because errors are made should not discount the practice altogether.
1.2.11.1.1.1. Con: Because errors will always be made, and the cost of making errors in the instance of capital punishment is to high to be acceptable, capital punishment can not be allowed.
1.2.11.1.1.2. Pro: The cost of repeat offenders who would otherwise have been killed via capital punishment makes it well worth the cost of the small, decreasing rate of wrongful execution.
1.2.11.2. Con: Even though wrongful conviction is an obvious judicial system problem; it should not be used as an excuse to forego punishing convicted felons. You can't just avoid punishing everyone until the system gets repaired.
1.2.11.2.1. Con: Not executing someone is not the same as foregoing punishment, as there are other forms of punishment.
1.2.11.2.2. Con: A person who is wrongfully imprisoned may be released and compensated. Capital punishment is irreversible. You can't bring people back from the dead.
1.2.11.3. Con: Irrevocable consequences cannot be an impartial motivation for the abolition of capital punishment. Irrevocable consequences are supposed to be possible in all human action and this can not be a justifiable impartial reason for abolishing all human action. For example, it is possible that a doctor causes someone's death and this possibility is not supposed to be a justification for the abolition of medicine or the abolition of all medical practices.
1.2.11.3.1. Con: The fact that people may be wrong does not mean that the possibility of remedying an error should be removed.
1.2.11.3.2. Con: The example suggests a parallel between an accidental death and deliberate killing. It is not a fair example and does not carry the argument.
1.2.11.4. Pro: If it is wrong to commit murder \(aka kill an innocent person\), then capital punishment could only be moral if there was zero chance of wrongful conviction.
1.2.11.4.1. Con: If we reserve capital punishment for the worst of crimes with 100% proof then there is no risk of wrongful punishment.
1.2.11.4.1.1. Con: Is practically impossible to determine what is 100% proof.
1.2.11.4.1.2. Con: Since humans are fallible, the risk of executing the innocent can never be eliminated.
1.2.11.4.1.2.1. Con: The inevitability of a mistake should not serve as grounds to eliminate the death penalty, rather, the trial system should be improved.
1.2.11.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Creating a perfect system is nearly impossible. You could lower the probability of a mistake, but you could never prevent them completely.
1.2.11.4.1.2.1.2. Con: If a mistake is inevitable, as stated above, no amount of adjustment to the trial system could completely rule out the execution of an innocent individual.
1.2.11.4.1.2.1.3. Con: It is, however, grounds to call the death penalty unjust until such a time as trial systems are perfected. The debate shouldn't be whether the death penalty could ever be just, it should be about whether it is unjust in current society.
1.2.11.4.1.2.2. Pro: It has been [proven](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.full) that judges make more favorable decision after they had a meal.
1.2.11.4.1.2.3. Pro: Factors surrounding personal beliefs such as racist ideologies and opinions about people involved in the case \(the victim, victim's families, and public opinion\) could possibly, if not probably, affect decisions made by juries and judges. There is no such thing as a blank slate.
1.2.11.4.1.2.3.1. Pro: Judges are not immune to unconscious racism, and juries have [frequently demonstrated racism](http://www.nationalmagazine.ca/Articles/July-2015-Web/Who-are-you-calling-racist.aspx)in [conviction](http://time.com/4949761/keith-tharpe-death-penalty-supreme-court/) and sentencing.
1.2.11.4.1.3. Pro: Sometimes there are cases where there is irrefutable evidence that somebody has committed a crime where that person is clearly unable/unwilling to be rehabilitated \(examples like [Jeffrey Dahmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer), etc.\). In these situations, a life sentence is a waste of resources.
1.2.11.4.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.
1.2.11.4.1.3.2. Con: Even if a conviction appears 100% solid, it can still turn out to be wrong. For example, if someone is successfully framed, or in cases of corruption, or false confessions. Such a conviction could mistakenly be determined to have been carried out with absolute certainty of the defendants guilt.
1.2.11.4.1.4. Con: There have been many examples of wrongful convictions in recent history. See this list just from the state of Texas alone: [innocencetexas.org](https://innocencetexas.org/our-work). Since 1989 there have been 354 convicted men and women exonerated by DNA evidence: [www.innocenceproject.org](https://www.innocenceproject.org/dna-exonerations-in-the-united-states/).
1.2.11.4.1.4.1. Pro: This includes [20](https://www.innocenceproject.org/dna-exonerations-in-the-united-states/) prisoners who were sentenced to death.
1.2.11.4.2. Pro: To kill an innocent deliberately is murder. Thus, it follows that execution of the innocent is murder. The justice system would be a murderer, and thus subject to capital punishment.
1.2.11.5. Pro: The possibility of a wrongful claim of guilt whose punishment cannot be rescinded in the case of capital punishment is not just an obstacle to defending the punishment in almost all cases; it actually makes it inhumane in proper theory too. Because uncertainty is the norm in human life, it should be incorporated in our theories of what is just and unjust too. It leads to dangerous results to adopt the principle hypothetically lest the practical reasons against it be forgotten.
1.2.11.6. Con: In some cases, the guilt of the convicted person is beyond any doubt.
1.2.11.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.4.1.
1.2.11.6.2. Con: Still, that is difficult to decide. A lot of [people get convicted](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jailed-innocent-record-number-people-exonerated-2015-n510196) on very little evidence. We hear all the time about innocent people who did [20+ years](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11485165/Americas-longest-serving-innocent-prisoner-receives-1m-for-39-years-in-jail.html) in prison.
1.2.11.6.3. Con: Those cases are rare. Many convicts claim to be innocent.
1.2.11.7. Con: Society is willing to accept some limited individual injustices where the system fails in order to protect the overall functioning of justice for most people. As the saying goes: "perfection is the enemy of the good." There are many cases where society accepts some risk of individual deaths in order to protect the public good, such as in the medical system where the risk of accidental death is tolerated, or in traffic safety systems or air travel which tolerate some level of lethal risk, etc.
1.2.11.7.1. Con: Blackstone's formulation is a cornerstone of the modern justice system that "It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer". This is especially true for capital punishment. If perfection is the enemy of the good then perfection should always triumph over good even if that means a guilty person is set free.
1.2.11.8. Pro: Capital punishment ignores the plausibility that eventually exonerating evidence may come to light. It therefore undermines justice by exacting a punishment that cannot be undone and/or satisfactorily compensated.
1.2.11.8.1. Con: Executions never take place immediately. In fact, there is an average of 15 years between conviction and execution in America. Wrongful convictions have a large window in which to be appealed. \([deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/cp12st.pdf) - table 10\)
1.2.11.8.1.1. Con: There have been cases of wrongful convictions which have taken longer than 15 years to be exonerated, such as [Mark Maxon \(23 years\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Maxson).
1.2.11.8.1.2. Con: That's nice. And we do find a few people in this window. It is highly unlike, and irresponsible to think that, we get every one of them.
1.2.11.8.1.3. Con: If that 4.1% deserving-of-release rate is true of death row inmates that are executed, and we only actually release 1.6%, we can expect 2.5% of death row inmates to be innocent. We actually execute 16.8% of death row inmates, suggesting 8 or 9 [current death row inmates](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row-inmates-state-and-size-death-row-year) will be executed when they ought to be exonerated. Based on [individual states' execution rates](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions-death-sentence), that's probably 3-4 in Texas, 0-1 each in Alabama, Florida, Ohio, and Oklahoma, and 0-3 in the rest of the country combined.
1.2.11.8.1.3.1. Con: [That study](http://pnas.org/content/111/20/7230) looks at death row inmates whose sentences are changed to life-in-prison, and judges that some of them would walk out of prison entirely if they had remained on death row where the efforts to defend them are greater. It does not offer any evidence that any executed inmate was deserving of exoneration. It doesn't look at executed inmates at all.
1.2.11.8.1.4. Con: This claim fails to address the considerably large number of people later exonerated by the Innocence Project who were executed prior to being shown they were innocent.
1.2.11.8.1.5. Con: This claim tethers justice to the variable efficiency of the justice system and not fundamental justice or the rightness of the act.
1.2.11.9. Pro: [Wrongful convictions are rampant in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wrongful_convictions_in_the_United_States). With such a flawed system, the death penalty should not be used.
1.2.11.9.1. Pro: Until now it is known that more than 4% of death row inmates [were innocent](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/death-penalty-study-4-percent-defendants-innocent); with a high probability of more undetected cases.
1.2.11.9.2. Con: If there would not be so many wrong convictions, capital punishment would be \(more\) acceptable. Therefore, the method of punishment is irrelevant, the method of discovering the truth is to be questioned.
1.2.11.9.3. Pro: A study estimates that if all death-sentenced defendants remained under sentence of death indefinitely, [at least 4.1%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/death-penalty-study-4-percent-defendants-innocent) would be exonerated due to discrepancies in DNA, testimonies, and biased juries. If we abolish the death penalty, it allows time for innocent people to be exonerated.
1.2.11.9.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.8.1.3.
1.2.11.9.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.11.8.1.3.1.
1.2.11.9.4. Pro: Mentally ill patients may be put to death.
1.2.11.9.4.1. Con: For egregious crimes where recidivism is non-zero, even mentally ill patients should be put to death.
1.2.11.9.4.2. Con: [Mentally ill](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-30316117) convicts are only put to death, if it can be assessed that they have a rational understanding of their crimes and their punishment for those.
1.2.11.9.4.2.1. Con: The [National Association of Mental Health](https://www.amnestyusa.org/files/pdfs/deathpenaltyfacts.pdf) has estimated that 5 to 10% of those on death row have serious mental illness.
1.2.11.9.4.2.2. Con: The [Ford v. Wainwright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_v._Wainwright) decision, however, left the determination of sanity up to each state.
1.2.11.9.4.2.2.1. Pro: Texas declared a man [sane](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/02/texas-execution-mentally-ill-history-scott-panetti) enough for execution even though there were considerable indications that he was not.
1.2.11.9.4.2.3. Pro: Independent consultants are reliable in identifying who has a "rational understanding" for his or her deeds
1.2.11.9.4.2.4. Con: Criteria to assess "rational understanding" change over time
1.2.11.9.4.2.4.1. Pro: The IQ threshold which demarks the mentally sane and insane in some rulings might vary or be interpreted as cutting or shallow edge
1.2.11.9.4.3. Pro: Numerous [capital inmates](https://www.aclu.org/report/report-mental-illness-and-death-penalty?redirect=mental-illness-and-death-penalty) suffering from serious mental illnesses have been executed.
1.2.11.9.4.4. Con: In [Ford v. Wainwright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_v._Wainwright) \(1986\), the US Supreme Court banned the execution of inmates who were insane.
1.2.11.9.4.4.1. Con: In legal terms,[Insanity](http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=979) is defined as "mental illness of such a severe nature that a person cannot distinguish fantasy from reality, cannot conduct her/his affairs due to psychosis, or is subject to uncontrollable impulsive behavior." Therefore, the Ford v. Wainwright ruling does not protect all mentally ill convicts/suspects.
1.2.11.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.4.1.4.
1.2.11.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.2.2.
1.2.12. Con: Morality is absolute, not relative. It is morally wrong to kill someone, irrespective of the morality of that individual.
1.2.13. Con: Felons have a right to rehabilitation \([Rotman](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6540&context=jclc), p. 1067/1068\).
1.2.13.1. Pro: A rehabilitated criminal could make a morally valuable contribution to society.
1.2.13.1.1. Con: In most cases convicted felons are stigmatized and hence often unable to reintegrate or even contribute to society.
1.2.13.1.1.1. Con: There are methods of imprisonment that enhance socialization rates.
1.2.13.1.1.2. Pro: This is especially true due to the freely accessible '[Inmate Release Information database](http://www.dc.state.fl.us/offendersearch/Search.aspx?TypeSearch=IR)', by which everyone can check if their neighbor is a former inmate. This stigmatizes former criminals.
1.2.13.1.1.2.1. Con: This should be seen as an argument against social stigmatization, or the very existence of the Inmate Release Information database. It shouldn't \(and doesn't\) discourage the rehabilitation attempt.
1.2.13.1.1.3. Con: Life without parole solves this dilemma, and doesn't violate felons' right to life.
1.2.13.1.2. Con: People sentenced to death are charged with severe crimes, which are the result of a personal[lack of empathy](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0185106315000074) or other social disorders.
1.2.13.1.2.1. Pro: [A study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898494/) concluded that violent offenders' emotion recognition capabilities are reduced compared to healthy controls.
1.2.13.2. Pro: As long as rehabilitation and reintegration remain goals of the prison system, the purpose of incarceration is not to await death. As long as such goals remain possible, the worst of criminals are just as entitled to that opportunity as any other criminal.
1.2.13.3. Con: Rehabilitation is not a right. It is sought after byproduct of the justice system. The right belongs to society to not have criminals among it, to ensure that right the justice system has an obligation to rehabilitate people prior to releasing them on civilization.
1.2.13.4. Pro: Everyone has the potential to be rehabilitated. Capital punishment denies them this option.
1.3. Con: The death penalty is an effective deterrent, preventing serious crimes from occuring in the first place.
1.3.1. Pro: Most crimes are committed as a result of a cost-benefit analysis, therefore increasing the penalty would increase the associated costs of committing the crime and make the crime less likely to occur.
1.3.1.1. Pro: As the vast majority of individuals want to avoid their lives to be taken, it is very likely that death penalty works as an effective deterrent.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Death is often referred to as "paying the ultimate price," underscoring the societal consensus that death is the worst thing that could happen to a person.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: Some criminals embrace death or view it as inevitable.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Some criminals turn themselves in, or confess to a crime, embracing punishment as part of their psychological motivations.
1.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: Suicidal personalities are sometimes [found](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/science/the-mind-of-those-who-kill-and-kill-themselves.html?_r=0) among those who commit murder.
1.3.1.1.3. Con: Death is not a top fear for most people.
1.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: In a survey, only [21.9%-16.8%](https://blogs.chapman.edu/wilkinson/2015/10/13/americas-top-fears-2015/) of respondents answered that they were "Afraid" or "Very Afraid" of dying.
1.3.1.1.4. Con: Certain high-profile mass shootings, such as the 2017 Las Vegas Strip shooting and the Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting ended with the perpetrator taking their own life
1.3.1.2. Con: We cannot assume that in a cost benefit analysis, everyone would see death as a greater cost than life imprisonment.
1.3.1.3. Con: Homicides are often crimes of passion, and therefore insusceptible to rational deterrence.
1.3.1.4. Con: Some research has shown that increasing the *severity* of a punishment does not have much effect on crime, while increasing the *certainty* of punishment does have a deterrent effect.
[Deterrence in Criminal  Justice  Evaluating Certainty vs. Severity of  Punishment](http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/Deterrence%20Briefing%20.pdf)
1.3.1.4.1. Pro: 1/3 of murders go unsolved in the US. [npr.org](https://www.npr.org/2015/03/30/395069137/open-cases-why-one-third-of-murders-in-america-go-unresolved)
1.3.1.5. Con: This assumes humans to be totally rational beings, dispassionately weighing the options.
1.3.1.5.1. Con: The word "most" in the expression "most crimes" turns the affirmation weaker, in the sense that all it supposes is most part of time human are rational.
1.3.2. Pro: Abolishing the death penalty may show that society is taking a softer stance on crime.
1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.
1.3.2.2. Con: If the end goal is less crime, and a society achieves that goal with "softer punishments" and "stronger rehabilitation attemps", who cares how it "looks"?
1.3.2.3. Con: The assumption the parent is making is that nothing else changes.  If the luxuries found inside of a prison were removed, such that they became harsher places to stay, and incarceration was indefinite \(finite sentences and parole abolished\), and release contingent on rehabilitation, then a failure to execute prisoners would not be viewed as "going soft on crime".  Crime would be de-incentivized and we can have greater confidence in non-repeat offenders.
1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.4.4.1.
1.3.4. Con: The death penalty does not fight the causes of crime, but only the symptoms.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Investment in education, social workers, drug education programs would make more sense.
1.3.4.2. Pro: While jailing tries to deal with the causes in its aftermath through re-socialisation, the death penalty literally eradicates the symptons.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: Re-socialisation is not really an integral part of the American justice system, as [Vera Institute of Justice study finds](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2013/11/why-america-has-mass-incarceration-problem-while-germany-and-netherlands-dont/7553/). It is much more focussed on retribution.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Con: The American justice system should have re-socialization and as integral part, then.
1.3.4.3. Con: Penalty and prevention cannot be seperated regarding crimes. The preventive part of the death penalty is to discourage and therewith fight the "cause of crime".
1.3.4.3.1. Con: Reactionary sentencing, in any case of crime, doesn't prevent people from committing crimes. Understanding the [psychological processes](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/addressing-mental-illness-criminal-justice-system) in what drives people to do things that some deem worthy of capital punishment is the means to provide help to these individuals to prevent the next crime from occurring; and thus will prevent the next victim as well.
1.3.5. Con: Public policy that allows for the death penalty [weakens the social principle against killing people](http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~unger/articles/deathPenalty.html).
1.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Leaders do influence attitudes and values that people have.  Hitler influenced his followers to do horrible deeds. Similiarly, government leaders who advocate for killing people \(execution\) unintentionally encourage people to kill others.
1.3.6. Con: There remains [no evidence](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/13363/deterrence-and-the-death-penalty) that capital punishment effectively deters violent crime.
1.3.6.1. Pro: If capital punishment were a highly effective deterrent, murders would not exist. As people still murder, death penalty has been ineffective to stop it.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: There is no reason to expect any deterrent to be absolute.
1.3.6.2. Pro: [A review](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/discussion-recent-deterrence-studies) of three decades of studies on the effects of capital punishment on deterring crime concluded that research up to date cannot offer any conclusive information on the link between capital punishment and its effect on homicides.
1.3.6.3. Pro: There is [no significant correlation](https://fullfact.org/news/do-countries-death-penalty-have-higher-homicide-rates/) between capital punishment and homicide rates:

"Ranking all 147 countries for which data was available in terms of homicide rate, and comparing this to whether the penalty existed or not, yielded a weak positive correlation of 0.2.** This means that there is some correlation between imposing the death penalty and having higher homicide rates, but this correlation is in fact weak to bordering on insignificance."
1.3.6.3.1. Pro: Standard practice in hard sciences is that a correlation must exceed 0.95 to be considered significant. In soft sciences, it is more like 0.4 or 0.5. 0.2 is never significant.
1.3.6.4. Pro: Top criminologists do not believe the death penalty acts as a [deterrent](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-about-deterrence-and-death-penalty) to homicide.
1.3.6.4.1. Pro: In a survey of 70 current and former presidents of three professional associations of criminologists, 85% of the experts agreed that the empirical research on deterrence has shown that the death penalty never has been, is not, and never could be superior to long prison sentences as a deterrent to criminal violence \([Radelet & Akers 1996](http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6901&context=jclc)\).
1.3.6.4.2. Pro: As two of the U.S.'s most experienced deterrence researchers conclude after their review of recent scholarship, "The available evidence remains 'clear and abundant' that, as practiced in the United States, capital punishment is not more effective than imprisonment in deterring murder" \([Bailey & Peterson 1997, p.155](http://www.jstor.org.tkc.idm.oclc.org/stable/223436)\).
1.3.6.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.
1.3.6.4.4. Pro: [A UN survey](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/capitalpunishment/against_1.shtml) of 1988 failed to provide scientific proof that executions have a greater deterrent effect than life imprisonment.
1.3.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.1.2.
1.3.6.6. Con: "Recent research on the relationship between capital punishment and homicide has created a consensus among most economists who have studied the issue that capital punishment deters murder." --Paul Rubin, Professor of Economics and Law at Emory University, [Written Testimony for the Senate Judiciary](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237588087_Statistical_Evidence_on_Capital_Punishment_and_the_Deterrence_of_Homicide) Committee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Property Rights, February 1, 2006.
1.3.7. Pro: Execution is a 100% effective prevention of additional crimes by that particular offender. Even life in prison is not 100% effective, as crimes between prison inmates do happen.
1.3.7.1. Con: High effectiveness in this case can be misleading, as reducing the human population to 1, by executing all but oneself, would also be a 100% effective deterrent of additional crimes, but would be morally indefensible.
1.3.8. Con: Crimes of passion are seldom deterred by any potential form of punishment.
1.3.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.3.9. Con: If this were true, the death penalty should be made as public and as gruesome as possible, as was done in ancient times. As it is, we compromise capital punishment's presumed efficacy as a deterrent by conducting executions privately by "humane" means.
1.3.9.1. Con: That which is feared most is that which is unknown. The death should be secret not public, even the methods and means should be kept relatively unknown.
1.3.9.2. Pro: The [head ripping off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfsMMVgIToA) machine as an option which is gruesome and very scary, it would make capital punishment an effective deterrent.
1.3.10. Con: The death penalty in US has been rendered useless by [16+ years average time](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/time-death-row) before sentence carried out, endless motions & appeals by taxpayer funded lawyers. More [die of old age / sickness](http://articles.mcall.com/1997-12-07/news/3169299_1_death-row-death-sentences-death-warrants) on 'death row' than are ever executed.  If had 1 year limit on time, would be far more effective as would be 'fresh' in public memory, not from their parents time when murder was done. In days of electric chair, gas chamber, etc., it was far more effective.
1.3.11. Con: Many perpetrators of capital crimes that may result in a death sentence, like terrorism and public shootings, willingly accept their own death as a probable outcome. Thus, capital punishment is not a deterrent to them.
1.3.12. Con: The death penalty leaves scares on the families from which the criminal comes, potentially alienating them from the justice system.
1.3.13. Pro: Capital punishment is a spectacle that serves to communicate to society what actions are heinous and deserving of the most extreme form of punishment. Thus it serves to strengthen moral norms and thereby leads to a more just society.
1.3.13.1. Con: Punishment may weaken moral ill-norms; that is not the same as strengthening norms. Kicking the odd cyclist in the head doesn't promote the use of helmets, so to speak.
1.3.14. Con: Capital punishment is inhumane and out of fashion. US can explore other options to reduce or discourage serious crimes such as courageous gun control law and correction-led tough punishment for serious crimes.
1.4. Con: Capital punishment protects public safety by ensuring that convicted criminals do not ever offend again.
1.4.1. Pro: A dead criminal cannot commit another crime.
1.4.1.1. Con: A dead criminal or terrorist can become a martyr or a reason of revenge by fellow criminals, family members, religious brothers, etc, thus make sure others will continue to carry on crimes in the criminal or terrorist' spirit.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Individual Justice means that each person is held to account for their own choices. Each person who commits further crimes will be held responsible for their own actions, even more so because they have seen and understood the consequences already.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Many of them who are "only incarcerated" continue to [arrange & indirectly commit crimes](http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2015/sep/24/federal-indictments-say-prison-gangs-used-cellphones-run-crime-rings/326926/) through associates on the outside.
1.4.1.3. Con: A reformed and well-integrated criminal will not commit other crimes.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Some criminals are so morally corrupt that taking them out of the civilian and prison population indefinitely is the only way to guarantee safety of individuals found in both systems.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: Long prison sentences do not prevent convicted criminals to frequently offend in jail, as the high number of crimes in prisons, such as[jail murders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/07/23/how-often-do-prisoners-die-behind-bars/?utm_term=.77bf77439248), indicates.
1.4.1.4.2. Con: One can be taken out of the civilian and prison population in other ways than through death \(e.g. exile on deserted island\).
1.4.1.5. Con: A dead wrongfully convicted felon cannot contribute to society. That life is wasted. An innocent person murdered by his government is a greater tragedy than a career criminal spending the rest of his life in prison.
1.4.2. Con: Life without parole can also make sure that a convicted criminal does not ever offend again.
1.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.4.1.
1.4.2.3. Pro: A criminal threat is already eliminated from society by incarceration. The only purpose the death penalty can serve is to exact revenge, not justice.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: Some crimes are so heinous that justice requires revenge/punishment in the form killing the perpetrator.
1.4.3. Con: The risk of recidivist murders is low.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Among those whose death sentences were commuted in 1972, only about one percent went on to kill again\([Marquart & Sorenson, p. 28](http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1612&context=llr)\)
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Punishments are typically commuted for low-risk prisoners, who are unlikely to reoffend. This may not be true of the general group on death row.
1.4.4. Con: Death row inmates are under a lot of stress, because of this they are more likely too snap and seriously injure and/or kill guards and/or other inmates. the death penalty could potentially put innocent lives in serious danger.
1.4.5. Con: The death penalty severely endangers the public by removing the possibility of a criminal "digging himself in deeper".

A criminal who believes they will be executed for one crime they've already committed has no reason to avoid further or worse crimes, because there can be no greater punishment than he is already due.
1.4.5.1. Con: Same could be claimed about any highest punishment, for example life imprisonment, because once a criminal is facing any strictest sentence, there is no greater punishment than he or she is already due. Abolishing the death penalty would not decrease this risk.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: This is not true at all, because the justice system has wide latitude in the nature and terms of imprisonment.

Even in a life sentence, quality of life can vary hugely.
1.4.6. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.4.7. Con: The execution of criminals hinders the ability to understand the motivations of why crimes were committed, reducing the amount of tools used for prevention
1.4.7.1. Con: A death row inmate waited an average of [178 months](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/capital-punishment-2010-statistics) \(14 years 10 months\) before execution. That seems like plenty of time to determine anything that can be determined about their motives and nature.
1.4.7.2. Pro: Killing a perpetrator deprives us of chance to ever fully understand the nature of the crime and its socioeconomic context. What do we, as a society, have to change in our system to produce less people prone to crime? Capital Punishment is actually pushing the problem under the carpet.
1.4.8. Con: That is a statement of fact, but is not an argument for why capital punishment is just. Technically, capital punishment can also be used to against people who drive over the speed limit, but we understand that there are more humane methods of punishment.
1.4.9. Pro: The law is there to protect the innocent. As long as someone dangerous to the public is locked up, that is all that is needed.   If someone dangerous to the public manages to repeatedly escape, then the death penalty might be considered as the only alternative.
1.4.10. Pro: There are individuals who are not suited for the community, cannot or will not ever benefit the community - at least not in any way that could possibly equal the harm they have done.  We should not be forced as a community to pay for them to live comfortable for the rest of their days when they will never contribute meaningfully no repay the debt.  Life in prison is what should be abolished.
1.4.10.1. Con: To determine a person's "right to live" by his "contribution v. cost to society" is a dangerous slippery slope. It could lead to minor crimes convicts, people on welfare, or people with a lot of debt, to have fewer rights than the majority, which is not \(and should not be\) the case in a Democratic society.
1.4.11. Pro: Some of the worst criminals can inspire copycats by spreading there ideas whilst inside with access to internet, or from their public exposure which immortalises them and causes people to idolise them.
1.4.11.1. Con: Execution can turn criminals into glorified martyrs.
1.4.12. Con: Crime isn’t solved by the death penalty though. In other words, if it were effective at protecting the public, crime should decrease. It doesn’t.
1.4.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.1.2.
1.4.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.
1.4.13. Con: Considering the number of wrongful convictions, and the racially biased nature of capital punishment convictions, it cannot be said that public safety is ensured by capital punishment.
1.4.14. Con: The rehabilitation of a serious criminal is much more useful to the protection of society than a dead, serious criminal. They would be most convincing in redirecting others going down a similar path toward a serious crime.
1.4.15. Pro: Kary Mullis, Nobel Prize-winning American biochemist, uses the analogy of a rock rolling down a hill towards a town in his book, "Dancing Naked in the Minefield". You would destroy the rock if you could, right? You wouldn't seek to rehabilitate the rock. A serial killer is the rock in this case, a force of nature that destroys -- the rock may not have a will towards destruction and the murderer might be compelled by similarly invisible forces.
1.4.16. Pro: Society has an absolute right to protect itself with the execution of killers who have committed premeditated murder and so are apt to kill again.  In such instances of premeditated murder, since the penalty suits the crime, society should not be obligated to incur the extraordinary expense as well as the hazard of a life sentence in lieu of the death penalty.  Such obligations -- the extraordinary cost and hazard -- in effect penalize society rather than the murderer who committed the crime.
1.5. Pro: The death penalty is often applied in an arbitrary \(discriminatory; inconsistent\) manner.
1.5.1. Pro: Inadequate legal representation is a factor leading to wrongful conviction, this affects mostly uneducated and poor people.
1.5.1.1. Pro: [A study](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/00/06/lawStudy.html) by Columbia university found that 68% of convictions were reversed on appeal, with poor representation cited as the main reason for the reversal.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Out of all offenders who are sentenced to death, [three quarters](https://politicalpromise.wordpress.com/2011/08/01/the-death-penalty-unhelpful-immoral-and-dangerous/) of those who are allocated a [legal aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_aid) lawyer can expect execution, a figure that drops to a quarter if the defendant could afford to pay for a lawyer.
1.5.1.3. Con: The law is blind, i.e. disregards ethnicity, race, religion, sex, or social background in its sentences.
1.5.1.3.1. Con: The law is only blind in theory, not in practice. It is an ideal we aim for, not something we have actually achieved.
1.5.1.3.1.1. Pro: There is extensive evidence indicating that in actual practice, the law is extremely racist, moderately sexist, and discriminates very strongly in favour of rich people and against poor people.

See \(two random examples from a VERY long list\):

Bobo, Lawrence D.; Thompson, Victor \(2006\). "Unfair By Design: The War on Drugs, Race, and the Legitimacy of the Criminal Justice System". Social Research. 73: 445–472.

Locking Up Youth: The Impact of Race on Detention Decisions \([journals.sagepub.com](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/000312240406900201)\)
1.5.1.3.1.2. Pro: Since the entirety of society still has issues with bias and perception of race, those prejudices do not suddenly vanish in the courtroom.

It is not a coincidence that the states which keep execution alive today are the ones where lynching was most prevalent a century ago; one has increased to replace the other.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: The [percentage of black inmates on death row](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/05/03/308370643/whos-waiting-on-death-row) \(41%\) is disproportionate to the general population of black people in the US \(13%\).
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: The relevant proportion is percentage of black inmates on death row to the proportion of black, guilty convicts.
1.5.1.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.4.1.2.3.1.
1.5.1.3.2. Con: When the human factor is applied, people have free will to assume anything they want, including police officers.
1.5.1.3.3. Con: In the US criminal cases are tried by a jury, which may be swayed by current prejudices in the society.
1.5.1.4. Pro: The death penalty punishes the poor. If you can't afford good legal representation, you are more likely to end up on death row. In the United States, in 2007, according to the [Equal Justice Initiative](http://www.worldcoalition.org/media/resourcecenter/EN_WD2017_FactSheet), 95% of people on death row have disadvantaged economic backgrounds. A defendant who does not have the financial capacity to hire a private lawyer will have to rely on free legal aid provided by the government. Such attorneys, however, are often underpaid and unprepared for death penalty cases.
1.5.1.4.1. Con: This makes it a problem with the quality of state legal representation, not social status.
1.5.1.5. Con: This claim isn't particularly relevant to the death penalty more that any other penalty. Injustice can occur with any sentence. Should all punishments be abolished because of the risk of innocent people being charged? At what point do we decide the suffering of an innocent person becomes an acceptable risk? The problem here is injustice, not the death penalty.
1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.
1.5.3. Pro: The death penalty might be imposed on political grounds.
1.5.3.1. Pro: The death penalty can be imposed in the US [for treason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_the_United_States_federal_government#Capital_offenses), which can be politically abused.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: There is a danger that a change of government brings with it a change in national mood and suddenly some individuals will find themself to be the enemy of the state. There is a short distance then to death penalty just because one thinks differently and their beliefs become wrongful.
1.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.
1.5.3.3. Pro: The government being given, essentially, control over your right to life has potentially disastrous implications. If a law is passed that makes capital punishment applicable to homosexuality, for instance, then there is no recourse to respond saying 'the death penalty is illegal in our constitution', because it's not.
1.5.3.4. Pro: Politicians use the death penalty as a vote catcher and nobody should have to die to further a prosecutors career.
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: In many states, judges are elected by the citizens of their states, from District Courts to Supreme Court positions, in[partisan or non-partisan elections.](https://ballotpedia.org/Judicial_selection_in_the_states) Such elections often incite candidates to promise "harsh sentences" to satisfy and sway vindictive \(and bias\) electorates.
1.5.4. Pro: Race continues to play a strong role in US death penalty cases.
1.5.4.1. Pro: The death penalty is disproportionately applied to Black offenders.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Throughout the history of the United States, executions were disproportionately used to punish Black Americans. The death penalty [perpetuates the tradition of bias](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/05/the-inhumanity-of-the-death-penalty/361991/) and evokes the history of abuse.
1.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: During the Civil War, black soldiers were significantly more likely to be court-martialed and [executed](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/05/the-inhumanity-of-the-death-penalty/361991/) than white soldiers.
1.5.4.1.1.2. Pro: According to law professor Elizabeth Hillman, in World War II, "African-Americans comprised 10 percent of the armed forces but accounted for [almost 80 percent](https://books.google.com/books?id=hyA0T8qMITMC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=civil+war+colored+troops+%22more+likely%22+court+martialed&source=bl&ots=tTu05mGOcO&sig=WkytImvOoFZRXTiuyp4kmpz4vww&hl=en&sa=X&ei=v8lwU6T0F8-gsATLzoCwBg&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=civil%20war%20colored%20troops%20%22more%20likely%22%20court%20martialed&f=false) of the soldiers executed during the war."
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: In the case of [Furman v. Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman_v._Georgia), the US Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty, as it stood in 1972, included a racial bias against defendants and was cruel, unusual, and unconstitutional.
1.5.4.1.2.1. Pro: Although the white execution rate declined after the 1600s, the Black execution rate did not demonstrate a similar downward trend \([Allen and Clubb, 31-32](http://www.sunypress.edu/p-4608-race-class-and-the-death-penalt.aspx)\).
1.5.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.2.1.
1.5.4.1.4. Con: To the degree that's true, that's a problem with the court system, NOT with capital punishment. You could have a similar relationship between race and parole, but you probably wouldn't conclude that parole was immoral.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Those who kill white people are [considerably more likely](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/PierceRadeletStudy.pdf) to be sentenced to death than those who kill black people.
1.5.4.3. Pro: As of 2007, [over half](https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/hrpolicy/Publications/dinj_2010_en.pdf) of those on death row in the US were people of color or belonging to an ethnic minority.
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: Even though blacks and whites are murder victims in nearly equal numbers of crimes, 80% of people executed since the death penalty was reinstated have been executed for murders involving white victims. \([amnesty.org](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/AMR51/046/2003/en/)\)
1.5.4.3.2. Con: If they were legitimately convicted of committing crimes, then these statistics have no bearing.
1.5.4.4. Pro: President Barack Obama has ordered Attorney General Eric Holder to [review](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/03/us/flawed-oklahoma-execution-deeply-troubling-obama-says.html) the application of the death penalty in the US, following the failed execution of [Clayton Lockett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_of_Clayton_Lockett) in Oklahoma in 2014. The President noted concerns about innocence and racial bias.
1.5.4.4.1. Con: The fact that a politician takes a partisan act related to an issue of interest to his political base says absolutely nothing about the justice of capital punishment.
1.5.4.5. Pro: More than 20% of black defendants who have been executed were convicted by all-white juries. \([amnesty.org](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/AMR51/046/2003/en/)\)
1.5.4.6. Con: The problem here then is racism, not the death sentence. Unjust sentences due to race are not restricted to the death penalty. Extending this logic would mean that any kind of punishment should be abolished in case people of colour are convicted.
1.5.4.6.1. Con: The difference is that any other unjust punishment can be vacated, and those unfairly convicted compensated.  Innocent people convicted of crimes have successfully cleared their names after years or decades in jail, and then made new lives. It's difficult to compensate someone for being wrongly executed.
1.5.4.6.1.1. Con: This is a strong argument of eliminating racism in policing, prosecution, and sentencing practices, and not an argument against the death penalty per se.
1.5.5. Con: This an argument to reform the justice system, as arbitrary condemnation is against the principles of the constitutional state; not to abolish capital punishment per se.
1.5.6. Pro: Capital punishment should be abolished only because our justice system cannot guarantee uniformity among all the states in its application. We are incapable of making it "just" for society.
1.6. Con: Absent capital punishment life imprisonment would be the only choice. This is equally or more cruel.
1.6.1. Con: This does not account for the fact that many death row prisoners spend decades in prison between sentencing and execution while appealing. The ever present threat of being put to death would add to the equation.
1.6.1.1. Con: For those who have committed utterly heinous crimes, they don't necessarily merit an easy trial/process/ultimate death.
1.6.2. Con: If the convicted person would prefer death over a life sentence that would be a pro argument for euthanasia \(voluntary and supported death\) but not for involuntary capital punishment.
1.6.3. Pro: Some criminals may consider life in jail, which is still a death sentence, as more inhumane than capital punishment. Therefore, the option should not be totally abolished for all.
1.6.3.1. Con: A prisoner who is displeased with incarceration would probably be able to kill himself, without the help of someone else.
1.6.3.2. Con: If you wanted to listen to the reasoning of the criminals, they would have you set them free. Criminals do not carry out the death penalty, the state does and thus the state's mind needs to be changed.
1.6.3.3. Con: Death must be seen as the most severe form of punishment, because only then is it rationally viable as a capital form of punishment. Life in prison cannot be held as a higher form of punishment than death.
1.6.3.3.1. Con: Then maybe it is not rationally viable as a capital form of punishment. We have to decide first which one is the most severe form of punishment, and call that the capital form of punishment, not the other way around.
1.6.3.4. Con: The death penalty provides an escape for those who committed crimes from having to face long-term consequence from their actions.
1.6.3.4.1. Con: Death's a fairly long-term consequence.
1.6.3.5. Con: -> See 1.6.2.
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.2.
1.6.5. Con: Life imprisonment vs. capital punishment is the option many criminals go for hoping that somehow they will eventually regain their liberty. In the meantime, life in prison guarantees the criminals three nutritious meals a day, medical care, education, entertainment and other benefits for FREE, something the majority of Americans only dream of.
1.6.6. Pro: There is no point abolishing the death penalty if life without parole is the alternative since it is simply the death penalty by stealth. The executed prisoner and the lifer without parole both suffer and die in prison. It's just the process that is longer.
1.6.7. Pro: Capital punishment is more humane. It is inhumane to expose society members to convicted terrorists, murderers, etc. after their crimes against humanity are proven. That includes exposing them to other inmates and guards. In essence, enabling them to commit, promote, or enable future atrocities.
1.6.8. Con: There is another solution: help the criminals. Because to kill someone, you must be suffering a lot. That's the beginning of the problem. Just leave the killers in prison is useless. They must be healed.
1.7. Con: There is a public satisfaction knowing that a known convicted, and professed guilty perpetrator is no longer alive, no matter how much it costs. Some people are willing to accept the cost for that satisfaction.
1.7.1. Pro: Death penalty reduces the need some could have to deliver "justice" themselves.
1.7.1.1. Con: Vengeance is not a social good, nor is ensuring individuals do not engage in individual acts of vengeance by engaging in proxy acts of vengeance by the state.
1.7.1.2. Con: If a society judges capital punishment to be immoral, the prospect of civilians committing murder does not make it any more moral or just. Allowing the State to rob people would not discourage people from "revenge-robbing" others.
1.7.2. Con: The purpose of law is to determine and protect human rights, not satisfy some "public satisfaction".
1.7.2.1. Con: Human right laws are voted on by people who were elected by the public. That's "public satisfaction."
1.7.2.1.1. Con: The US Constitution is particularly [hard to change \(amend\)](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2014/05/amending_the_constitution_is_much_too_hard_blame_the_founders.html?via=gdpr-consent) and thus elected representatives rarely vote on constitutionally provided human right laws.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Con: Yet, the Constitution \(written by members selected by the public\) clearly [states](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/death_penalty) death is a suitable punishment if done correctly through the court. Besides, nothing is cemented if the public can still vote on it, notoriously hard or not.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.3.13.
1.9. Pro: The purpose of the justice system should be to rehabilitate offenders and to attempt to right wrongs, not to punish or to satisfy a desire for revenge. The death penalty precludes the possibility of rehabilitation.
1.9.1. Con: The death penalty also precludes the possibility of further crime being commited by the offenders.
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.
1.9.3. Con: The purpose of the justice system is to apply the legally established punishment for committed crimes.
1.9.3.1. Pro: The legally established punishment itself indicates whether the end goal of the law is rehabilitation, punishment, or vengeance.
1.9.4. Con: There are subjects in this world who will not in any case rehabilitate - more than probably, they will commit again and over again the same felonies.
1.10. Pro: The death penalty violates human rights.
1.10.1. Pro: The death penalty violates several articles of the [UDHR](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) and other international conventions on human rights by abridging the right to life.
1.10.1.1. Pro: The Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights to Abolish the Death Penalty mandates an inalienable respect for life and [bans the death penalty.](http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-53.html)
1.10.1.1.1. Con: Despite its name, the treaty does not involve the US as a ratifying signatory, and its anti-death-penalty provisions are contentious broadly, as they also apply to abortion.
1.10.1.2. Pro: The United Nations has adopted resolutions condemning the death penalty based on [Article 3](http://www.manskligarattigheter.se/en/human-rights/what-rights-are-there/right-to-life-the-death-penalty) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that “everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person”.
1.10.1.2.1. Con: Both [Articles 1 and 6](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx) of the treaty allow for "lawful orders" and provisions that death penalty countries can employ such methods "in accordance with the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime"
1.10.1.3. Pro: According to [Article 6](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx) of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the right to life is to be protected by law. The same Article prohibits states from arbitrarily depriving persons of their lives.
1.10.1.3.1. Con: [Article 6](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx) states "In countries which have not abolished the death penalty, sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law in force"
1.10.1.4. Pro: [Article 2](https://rm.coe.int/1680063765) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms protects right to life.
1.10.1.4.1. Con: The US is not a signatory to this treaty.
1.10.1.4.1.1. Con: The existence of the treaty, and the time, effort, and popularity required to create it, suggest that it might have some good ides.
1.10.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Many European countries are critical of ECHR and some have made efforts to scrap it altogether.
1.10.1.4.1.1.2. Con: In [many polls](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/08/13/capital-punishment-50-years-favoured/) Europeans disagree on the position of the ECHR. It is far from universally popular on this issue.
1.10.1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: It is popular enough with popular lawmakers to remain law.
1.10.1.4.1.1.3. Con: Lots of time and effort can be spent on bad laws.
1.10.1.4.1.1.3.1. Con: Most of the time, when time and effort are put to work on a law, any negative consequence it may produce are not created as the result of the intended measures, but out of a careless oversight, or lack of understanding of scope, if there is effort behind an end, and that end is the goal, it's probably valuable.
1.10.1.5. Pro: The European Convention on Human Rights \([Protocol No. 13](https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/187)\) bans the death penalty for all crimes, including in times of war.
1.10.1.5.1. Con: The US is not a signatory to this treaty
1.10.1.5.1.1. Con: The fact that a whole continent says it's a bad idea suggests that it might not be the best idea.
1.10.1.5.1.1.1. Con: There are numerous debates in European countries about the lack of ability to deal with criminals owning to the ECHR being seen as too prohibitive for states. For instance, [the current British government wanted to scrap the human rights act](http://www.theweek.co.uk/63635/will-the-human-rights-act-be-scrapped)
1.10.1.5.1.1.2. Con: The whole continent does not say it's a bad idea. While it may be codified, [many polls](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/08/13/capital-punishment-50-years-favoured/) shown strong support from Europeans for the reintroduction of the death penalty
1.10.1.5.1.1.3. Con: This argument is fallacious. Simply because a position is [popular is not evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) in itself. For example, lots of people thought the Spice Girls were good, this doesn't mean that they were.
1.10.1.6. Con: The [UDHR](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) contains provisions in both articles 1 and 6 for "lawful orders" and death penalty countries.
1.10.1.7. Con: [Universal declaration of human](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) rights is obsolete document that was never since it publication in December 10, 1948 updated. Also this document suffers many unacceptable flaws, such as omission of fundamental rights, considers religion and culture as protected part of human rights. It does not declare when and how one may lose them. It does not declare when and how does someone qualifies/disqualifies as human with rights.
1.10.2. Pro: Capital punishment is a form of [torture](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx), which is a recognized violation of human rights.
1.10.2.1. Pro: A lot of things can go wrong during the execution and lead to enormous pain and suffering.
1.10.2.1.1. Con: Simply because an execution method may result in pain, either by accident or as an inescapable consequence of death, does not establish the sort of 'objectively intolerable risk of harm'.
1.10.2.1.2. Con: "Possibility does not imply necessity" - it is possible that a capital punishment causes pain and be "torture-like", but is not necessary that capital punishment is torture-like. For example, it is possible that you are a murderer, but it is not necessary that you are. So, the claim does not support the previous premise.
1.10.2.1.3. Pro: With hanging, an option still available in [Washington and Delaware](http://deathpenaltycurriculum.org/student/c/about/methods/hanging.htm), if the rope is too long, the inmate could be decapitated, and if it is too short, the strangulation could take as long as 45 minutes.
1.10.2.1.4. Pro: No one knows how long electrocuted individuals retain consciousness.
1.10.2.1.5. Pro: Lethal injection can lead to complications.
1.10.2.1.5.1. Pro: An Ohio man [survived a botched execution](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/lethal-injection/ohio-inmate-romell-brown-who-survived-2009-execution-appeals-high-n636311), raising ethical concerns over the practice of capital punishment.
1.10.2.1.5.2. Pro: It may take a prisoner some time to die after receiving a lethal injection, making the practice a cruel form of punishment. [An Arizona man](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-nn-arizona-execution-20140723-story.html) was still breathing two hours after being given lethal injection drugs.
1.10.2.1.5.3. Pro: In Alabama, a man had to suffer [for three hours](http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/death-row-inmate-survives-botched-lethal-injection/) in the execution chamber due to unsuccessful lethal injections. Finally, he left the chamber injured and bruised, but alive.
1.10.2.2. Pro: Lethal injection can cause an incredibly painful death.
1.10.2.2.1. Pro: One inmate [executed in 2014](http://nation.time.com/2014/01/10/oklahoma-convict-who-felt-body-burning-executed-with-controversial-drug/) was heard to say, "I feel my whole body burning."
1.10.2.2.2. Con: This is irrelevant; the fact that one method of capital punishment may result in a painful death does not in any way lead to the conclusion that all forms of capital punishment are torture.
1.10.2.3. Con: There are painless methods of execution, such as [inert gas asphyxiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_gas_asphyxiation), which occurs without the painful and traumatic feeling of suffocation. Accidental inert gas asphyxiation deaths occur without the person realizing anything is wrong.
1.10.2.4. Con: To be considered torture it would be necessary that the main objective was to cause pain due to some nonaccidental motivation \(there is no such thing as accidental torture\). Most death punishments don't fully fill this necessary condition. Therefore, most of the death punishment is not torture.
1.10.2.5. Con: You are making a baseless claim. There is no correlation between the death penalty and torture.
1.10.2.5.1. Pro: According to [the definition](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/torture?s=t), it isn't. Torture is used to extract information, not to punish criminal activity.
1.10.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.10.4. Con: When a criminal violates someone else's human right \(i.e. to life\), they revoke their own right to those same human rights.
1.10.4.1. Con: Rights are not negotiable or dependent on conduct. Humane, civilized societies do not deprive citizens of rights, except in the interests of protecting others.
1.10.4.1.1. Con: Most rights, in practice, are not inalienable. Convicts lose their right against search and seizure while in prison, where random searches are common. Their right to vote is commonly suspended during incarceration as well. Some loss of rights as punishment for duely convicted crime is normal, even in humane and civilized societies.
1.10.4.1.1.1. Con: While most of the parent claim's examples do fit under the "protecting others" argument, suspending a convict's right to vote is very arguably unjust \(but also [another subject](https://www.kialo.com/should-felons-lose-the-right-to-vote-1470/1470.0=1470.1/=1470.1)\). Thus the inalienability of the "right to live" can and must be argued.
1.10.4.1.2. Con: Capital punishment is arguably to protect others from dangerous criminals, and thus fits the "protecting others" exception described.
1.10.4.1.3. Con: IIt is important to remember that rights are granted based on an agreed set of behaviors and obligations, with the expectation of mutual respect and cooperation. A right, therefore, is not just a law that allows individuals or governing bodies to do or say anything they wish. .... Every right manifests itself through a series of obligations or duties that flow outward from the central law, like ripples on water. 
[From: http://www.differencebetween.net](http://www.differencebetween.net/language/difference-between-rights-and-responsibilities/)
1.10.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.10.4.3. Pro: Criminals never give their victims humanitarian choices whether they want to be killed or not, and if they prefer brutal or fast death, or if they want to be raped or not, so we do not have to give them the choice as well.
1.10.4.3.1. Pro: A human such as a sadistic paedophile who has committed offences with intent does not have the same human rights as others.
1.10.4.4. Pro: A serial murderer is essentially a weapon of meat. To use or brandish a deadly weapon against your own society is a criminal act. By allowing a murderer to live is to become a murderer yourself. This would not apply to crimes of passion but "sport murderers" ...even if insane.
1.10.5. Con: This is based strictly on codified international human rights law and ignores [customary international law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/customary_international_law) - which is also considered a primary source of international law. Today more than 58 countries are death penalty retentionists and billions of people are within capital punishment jurisdictions. This weakens the argument that right to life is therefore a human right.
1.10.5.1. Con: Because billions live in death penalty jurisdictions, the fundamental right to life should not be called into question. Numbers do not determine whether something is, or is not, fundamentally right.
1.10.5.1.1. Con: While numbers don't help define the fundamental right in any abstract sense, they do help define it lawfully. This therefore goes some way to helping us determine what our codified human rights are
1.10.6. Con: If the death penalty is legal, then it in fact does not violate human rights. Rights exist in law and are not inherent to the universe's nature.
1.10.6.1. Con: Human rights are '[universal](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)'; every human being has these these rights irrespective of the national legislation.
1.10.6.2. Con: While law can \(and in true democracies, must\) be related to ethics and human rights, the opposite is not true. That's why laws are usually being modified and fixed, while there is no need to amend the UDHR.
1.10.7. Pro: The death penalty is incompatible with human dignity.
1.10.7.1. Pro: The act of killing another human leads to a detriment of what it means to be human. This act violates [human dignity](https://kantphilosophy.wordpress.com/kants-ethics/the-good-will/) as laid out by Immanuel Kant, and others that follow that philosophy.
1.10.7.1.1. Pro: Imagine a world where people could walk up to people, and kill them for some perceived slight, without offering them a chance to defend themselves, is this not a repulsive idea? It is hard to see how the death penalty differs from this.
1.10.7.1.1.1. Con: They did have a chance to defend themselves in court. Their defense failed. That is different than having no opportunity to defend themselves.
1.10.7.1.1.1.1. Con: They also had a chance to defend themselves by resisting arrest, but both these opportunities are in the past.
1.10.7.1.1.2. Con: The phrase "perceived slight" understates the high standards of proof and severity of the charge associated with capital punishment in modern America.
1.10.7.1.1.2.1. Con: From consequential points of view, yes, but Kant was not so concerned with consequences. His philosophy was in part a reaction to the consequential views of utilitarianism, and social contract, and how those systems broke down.
1.10.7.1.1.3. Con: Any random person acting independently is a different moral situation from an institution of oversight, professional ethics, and independent verification performing the same act.
1.10.7.1.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.10.7.1.1.2.1.
1.10.7.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.6.9.1.
1.10.7.1.3. Con: Morals, as philosophy, tend to be relative. Would you consider killing someone to relieve them from their pain \(e.g: eutanasia\) a detriment of what it means to be human? I think of it as quite the opposite.
1.10.7.2. Pro: Even if death is deserved for the nature of the crime, it does not mean that anyone has the right to kill another. No human being has the authority to intentionally kill criminals.
1.10.7.2.1. Con: In the case of enforcing law and self-defense, the use \(or at least threat\) of lethal force is essential to protect an individual's right to life. If no human being has the right to kill another, and this is accepted as a universal principle, then we must logically conclude that humans have a right to life, but not the right to protect that right.
1.10.7.2.1.1. Pro: [Good Samaritan laws](https://blog.uslawshield.com/texas-good-samaritans-what-can-you-legally-do/) are another example of a time when it is legal to take another person's life.
1.10.7.2.2. Con: We do, however, have the authority to defend ourselves. This is a preemptive defense of ourselves.
1.10.8. Con: Placing the life of a murderer on a scale and weighing it against the value of my daughter's life, \(Imagining she is a victim\) it would be clear my young daughter is of more worth. Life is not an infinite worth, just a high worth, yet we must protect the purer specimen \(virtuous or useful to society\). It is like keeping a purer diamond. Also, even if you argue \(foolishly\) that they are of equal worth, nothing makes his life more worthy of protection than my daughter's. We then are at an impasse.
1.10.9. Con: Human rights--and the protection we afford them--follow from the social contract. If anyone inflicts violence on another person, he has defied that contract and "declared war" on broader society; society may then use \(proportionate\) force in self-defense. Granted, capital punishment isn't always proportionate to the offense committed, but that doesn't make it wrong in principle.
1.10.10. Con: This is a circular argument since human rights are a consequence of what's right and what's not, and not vice versa.
1.10.11. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.6.
1.11. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.
1.12. Pro: Most major democracies have abolished and condemned the death penalty. The US should not be different.
1.12.1. Pro: The US carries out more executions than any other liberal democracy in the world. This is incompatible with the US' status as "world's greatest democracy".
1.12.1.1. Pro: Out of all the countries commonly referred to as "the west", the USA is the only country to still actively use the death penalty for crimes such as murder. Despite this, it has literally multiple times the amount of prisoners per capita than any other similarly defined country. [BBC: World Prison Populations](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/uk/06/prisons/html/nn2page1.stm)
1.12.1.2. Con: The US being the "world's greatest democracy" is a myth. If the poor had the same voting power as the corporate lobbies, [socioeconomic inequality would have decreased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States).
1.12.1.2.1. Con: "Proving" that the US is not the greatest democracy, does not justify having more execution. The US \(and every country\) should AIM to be the greatest democracy, and abolishing capital punishment is part of that progress.
1.12.1.3. Pro: 2012 the USA took a spot behind China, Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia for the  [most executions in the world](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130412-death-penalty-capital-punishment-culture-amnesty-international/), sitting ahead of Yemen and the  Sudan. Shameful.
1.12.1.4. Pro: Capital punishment is an antiquated form of punishment. The penal system was widely reformed in Western societies during the process of liberalization in the 18th century. The US seems to have missed out in this reform.
1.12.2. Pro: The death penalty contradicts the democratic principles of the US Constitution.
1.12.2.1. Pro: Different Supreme Court justices have different interpretations of cruel and unusual punishment. Determining whether a statute violates the Eighth Amendment is therefore difficult \([Kasten](http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=uauje), p. 13\).
1.12.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.2.
1.12.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.3.1.
1.12.2.4. Con: Whether or not the Death Penalty is humane is irrelevant. We follow the rule of law in the United States, not the rule of morality. The Fifth Amendment allows for the death penalty, where the government can take away your "life, liberty, or property" after a trail by jury. Also, the Eight Amendment "no cruel and unusual punishment" is not a valid reason to end the death penalty. The Supreme Court ruled in ["Gregg v. Georgia"](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1975/74-6257) that the death penalty does not violate the Eight Amendment.
1.12.2.4.1. Con: The subject of this discussion is literally "Capital Punishment In The US: Inhumane Or Just?" Morality and humane acts are at the debate's epicenter, whose conclusions would suggest a change in US laws.
1.12.2.5. Pro: Death penalty constitutes "cruel and unusual punishment," which is prohibited by the [Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)
1.12.2.5.1. Pro: In the state of California death sentence was recently ruled [unconstitutional](http://www.laweekly.com/news/californias-death-penalty-is-unconstitutional-federal-judge-says-4861573).
1.12.2.5.2. Con: -> See 1.12.2.1.
1.12.2.5.3. Pro: Judges must interpret the Constitution according to [evolving standards of decency.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/death_penalty) As society in the US becomes [increasingly uncomfortable](https://www.economist.com/blogs/lexington/2013/02/democracy-and-death-penalty) with the idea of executions being a public phenomenon, interpretations of the 8th Amendment must reflect that.
1.12.2.5.3.1. Con: [Popular support for the death penalty](http://news.gallup.com/poll/1606/Death-Penalty.aspx) in the USA is high, and ebbs \(1955-1966, 1994-2008\) and flows \(1966-1994\) over time with no consistent long-term trend. Standards of decency may never evolve to reject the death penalty.
1.12.2.5.4. Con: Solitary confinement for decades, including force-feeding and restraining you when attempting to end your life, is even more cruel than death.
1.12.2.5.4.1. Con: The existence of even more cruel punishments does not legitimize the death penalty.
1.12.2.5.4.2. Con: It is difficult to determine with absolute certainty what is more or less "cruel," since individuals can respond differently to the same situation.
1.12.2.5.5. Pro: The death penalty as a whole violates the 8th Amendment because it is [unreliable, arbitrary, slow and rare](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/opinion/is-the-death-penalty-unconstitutional.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fwilliam-baude).
1.12.2.5.5.1. Con: That characterization from a Supreme Court dissent backed by only two justices is criticized by [the same article](https://nytimes.com/2015/07/07/opinion/is-the-death-penalty-unconstitutional.html) when it says, "We should not be too quick to embrace Justice Breyer’s thinking. If his conclusion is something other than a personal moral intuition, it rests on deeply contested claims about the accuracy, goals and costs of the death penalty." In short, it's a poor and non-binding legal argument.
1.12.2.5.5.2. Con: The fact that it's slow and rare simply points out other problems in our legal system and says nothing relative to the justice of the death penalty.
1.12.2.6. Pro: From 1972 until 1976 the US Supreme Court had already put a halt on capital punishment due to its conflict with basic rights.
1.12.2.6.1. Con: In the Gregg decisions the death penalty was reinstated
1.12.2.6.2. Con: But the Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be per se unconstitutional.
1.12.2.6.3. Pro: In the case "[Furman v Gerogia](http://kids.laws.com/furman-v-georgia)" the US Supreme Court found that the death penalty was being imposed in an unconstitutional manner, on the grounds of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the 8th amendment.
1.12.2.7. Con: Given that it is unconstitutional, it is ironic therefore that the death penalty has been in use since the birth of the nation.
1.12.2.8. Con: The US Supreme Court has not deemed the death penalty unconstitutional. In fact, they have confirmed its constitutionality.
1.12.2.8.1. Pro: The Supreme Court found the [death penalty](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/death_penalty) not to be a violation of the 8th amendment.
1.12.2.8.2. Pro: [Baze v Rees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baze_v._Rees) determined by 7-2 that use of the lethal injection often used in capital punishment is not unconstitutional.
1.12.3. Con: It is a fallacy to argue that because other democracies abstain from an act, all democracies should. Every country faces its own unique challenges, some requiring different laws than other in order to achieve their aims.
1.12.3.1. Con: In the modern globalised world no country is isolated from others and thus, no country is truly unique when it comes to moral views.
1.12.3.2. Con: While I agree that the "majority" argument is invalid, morality and justice are universal, centralizing concepts. Therefore, democratic countries face similar moral challenges, and should conclude to similar lawmaking.
1.12.3.3. Con: A challenge met by violence is not a challenge well met.
1.12.3.3.1. Con: That depends entirely on what the challenge is. If a murderer enters your home or workplace, starts killing people, and there is no possibility of escape, then meeting this 'challenge' with violence may be the best solution, with any other solution resulting in your death.
1.12.3.3.2. Con: This is a slogan, not an argument. Some challenges require violence. Gandhi’s methods would not have stopped the holocaust. Only war could have put an end to it.
1.12.3.3.3. Con: Sound logic: a challenge met by violence is not a challenge well met, but not irrevocable. This assumes that all challenges arise in a caring, socially democratic environment. They do not. We are still biologically governed by fight or flight. If 'fight' has to happen then there will be violence.
1.12.3.4. Pro: We should base our laws on the will of the people and the precepts of the constitution, not on a popularity contest among other nations. How the Dutch, English, etc conduct their legal system, faced with very different populations and issues is their choice. How we deal with our issues, is ours.
1.12.3.5. Pro: The argument above further assumes that democracies are by nature morally good and that a morally good society is one that disallows capital punishment.
1.12.4. Pro: A total of [104 nations](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/death-penalty/), more than half of the world, abolished the death penalty by 2017.
1.12.4.1. Con: The majority of earth's population does not live in a country where death penalty is abolished, despite 100 states having abolished it.
1.12.4.2. Con: How many countries have abolished it is relatively irrelevant for a single countries' individual decision to abolish or introduce capital punishment.
1.12.4.3. Pro: The UN introduced a resolution during the General Assembly's 62nd sessions in 2007 calling for a universal ban.
1.12.4.4. Pro: In 1966, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was adopted by the [UN General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly). In Article 6 it says: "Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life."
1.12.4.4.1. Con: "Arbitrarily" is the key word. After a trial, conviction, and sentencing, a sentence of execution can hardly be considered arbitrary.
1.12.5. Pro: A new emphasis on the value of the individual and human life, as demonstrated by the institutionalized global human rights regime, [drove](http://www.jstor.org.tkc.idm.oclc.org/stable/10.1086/669507) the reform movements against capital punishment.
1.12.5.1. Con: A stronger belief in the value of the individual and human life doesn't preclude capital punishment. It emphasizes the significance of capital punishment in those strict cases in which it is warranted.
1.12.6. Pro: The United States should take a good look at the list of other Nations that allow for a death penalty. North Korea, Iran, China, Cuba, etc.  We condemn almost every Nation on the list for human rights violations. It amazes me that the United States of America practices this barbaric form of justice. We are the only Nation in all of North and South America that has a death penalty. In Europe, only Belarus - often dubbed "Europe's last dictatorship" - has a death penalty. Shame on us.
1.12.7. Con: The US was founded on "[being different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_exceptionalism)" from other nations. That is a big part of why we exist in the first place--as well as why so many people desire to immigrate and live here.
1.12.7.1. Con: We are different, but today the difference is not nearly so pronounced as it once was. In 1783, we were the only democratic republic in the West. Britain was a constitutional monarchy, France an absolutist monarchy, Germany as a unified state did not exist. Today, however, France, Germany and a score of Western European nations are set up as democratic republics and England’s monarchy is only a figurehead.
1.12.8. Con: Democracy is about diversity and freedom, not about sheepish behaviour and compliance.
1.12.8.1. Con: Being different for its own sake is not enough to justify the use of the death penalty.  Claiming we’re different because we’re a democracy has little to no bearing on capital punishment.
1.12.9. Con: There are other very successful democracies which carry out the death penalty, such as [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Japan) and [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_country#Industrialized_countries).
1.12.10. Pro: If government derives its legitimacy from the consent of its governed, the government killing individual citizens can never be justified.
1.12.10.1. Con: We have juries, a subset of the governed using your terms, determine guilt in a crime.  [In some cases, namely capital punishment, they also determine sentencing.](http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-procedure/sentencing-law-faq.html)  Your premise is false.
1.12.10.2. Con: Democratic Governments derive their legitimacy from the consent of the majority, as opposed to the entirety.
If the majority deem capital punishment to be acceptable then that is the only qualification that is needed.
1.12.10.2.1. Con: Always going with the majority opinion would allow us to violate the rights of minority groups, as we have in the past, like with [Japanese internment camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans), done to 'protect us', and prisoners stripped of [voting rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_disenfranchisement), done because 'they are evil'. Minority rights must be protected from majority tyranny. The will of the people, and even something that seems like a worthy goal, aren't enough to justify this.
1.12.10.2.1.1. Con: In its simplest form, democracy is based exactly on determining where a majority of the population stands. An accepted consequence of this system \(which is how most Western countries are governed\) is that there will always be a minority. That is very different from tyranny.
1.12.10.3. Con: Deadly force is [used in Law Enforcement around the world](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/heres-when-cops-around-the-world-are-allowed-to-use-force-2014-11) in order to protect the lives of law enforcement agents and potential victims of violent crime. Its prominence world wide is evidence that killing individual citizens is not antithetical to the legitimacy of consent. This alone is not proof that death penalty is justified, but demonstrates that lethal measures are not proof of illegitimacy.
1.12.11. Pro: It shows United States' mercy and intelligence to find another way to discipline his citizens.
1.12.12. Con: It's disingenuous to claim that "most major democracies" have abolished the death penalty. Their governments might have. But their citizens might not have actually consented. "Democracies" today impose plenty of laws hostile to their citizens. Even when those citizens are explicitly opposed to those policies. Massive, unwelcome immigration into the majority of "democracies" is a prime example.
1.12.12.1. Con: The majority of modern democracies are 'representative democracies' rather than 'direct democracies'. Decisions are not made by the people, they are made by elected representatives chosen by the people to govern them. This is by design as the popular decision is often not the right decision.
1.12.12.2. Con: Human Rights should be always considered first upon laws or "what citizens want" \(this usually represents what far right media wants you to think citizens want\). That's why racist, homophobic or murderer regimes have to be condemned, because it's the right thing.
1.12.12.2.1. Con: There is no universal standard of what is right vs. wrong. Groups of people \(from tiny villages to coalitions of nations\) merely accept certain behaviors. In fact, history suggests that what was accepted in the past might not be accepted in the present. Similarly, what is accepted by a certain group might be frowned upon by another - even to this day. If humanity agreed on absolute right vs. wrong, all governments would align, conflict would disappear, and progress would stop.
1.12.12.2.1.1. Con: Even if there were an agreed upon standard of right vs. wrong, people \(and, logically, governments\) could still elect to ignore that and act in a purposely wrong manner. For example, a tyrannical government could be set up by a group valuing their self-interests more than what is universally agreed upon to be right. Therefore, conflict could exist even with globally accepted standards of right vs. wrong.
1.12.13. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.4.
1.13. Pro: The death penalty is not efficient in terms of costs and procedure.
1.13.1. Con: Capital punishment contributes to solving the problem of overpopulation in the prison system.
1.13.1.1. Con: That would mean that you have to kill every inmate if you cut back on number of prisons. One can easily claim it's more humane and efficient to build more prisons to end overpopulation.
1.13.1.2. Con: There are not enough executions to have any significant effect on prison populations. Texas, famous as it is for its high execution rate, has [executed 543 people](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/number-executions-state-and-region-1976) since 1976. Compare that to a current [prison population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_incarceration_and_correctional_supervision_rate) of over 221,000.
1.13.1.3. Pro: The lack of carried-out death sentences is a major source of [prison overpopulation.](http://www.latimes.com/local/crime/la-me-ff-death-row-20150330-story.html) The result? The "lesser of two evils" is released back into society.  This defeats the purpose of justice, generally speaking.
1.13.2. Pro: Rehabilitation at least opens up the possibility of turning a convict into an economically productive member of society. Capital punishment does not.
1.13.2.1. Con: An economically productive member of society who repeats offenses \(ex. serial killers\), particularly with egregious crimes \(ex. murder, rape, etcetera\), is not worth the economic increment received.
1.13.2.1.1. Con: Even when rehabilitation is impossible, indefinite imprisonment is an option, if a person does not reform, we are not required to release them back into the public.
1.13.2.2. Con: The cost of rehabilitation may be greater than the economic increment received.
1.13.2.3. Con: The convict has already deprived the state of the economic product of the murdered person.
"Cutting your losses" is applicable here.
1.13.2.4. Pro: When someone commits the most severe crime, death punishment is not the solution as the solution is to teach them why, how it was not acceptable. Teach them to make amendment.
1.13.2.5. Con: -> See 1.9.4.
1.13.3. Pro: Keeping heinous offenders alive affords us the opportunity to learn from what makes them the way they are, and to find ways to improve our ability to rehabilitate them,as well as minimize the factors that produce them in the first place.
1.13.3.1. Con: Egregious crimes with high recidivism rates outweigh the benefits of rehabilitation. For example, consider a psycho killer who is released after rehab and kills another person. Any benefit that psycho killer could possibly have provided society after rehabilitation would not be worth the second life lost.
1.13.3.2. Con: While those on death row are condemmed to die, they have not had their rights stripped from them, notably their right to remain silent.
Death row inmates are not lab rats.
1.13.3.3. Pro: This is intuitively true. Note the criminological, sociological and psychiatric fraternity must be able to have access to those inmates to interview them.
1.13.4. Con: The death penalty eliminates unneeded waste of resources \(prison space, consumption of food, modern conveniences\) by eliminating societally unwanted individuals.
1.13.4.1. Con: [Enacting the death penality costs a lot of money.](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty)
1.13.4.2. Pro: In the United States, prisons are over capacity and absorb more federal funding that could be better spent elsewhere. The death penalty as an institution could be in-effect for convicted felons that show no sign of remorse, change/willingness to change. Example: Serial Killers, mid-high ranked Gang/Cartel/Mafia members.
[www.slate.com](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/everyday_economics/2010/10/true_crime_costs.html)
1.13.5. Con: The death penalty can be made more efficient in terms of cost and procedure. Costs should decrease with economies of scale. Procedures will become more efficient if we incentivize innovation.
1.13.5.1. Con: We probably shouldn't incentivize people to be overly creative when it comes to killing people, because that is exactly what will happen, and probably not only were it is intended too.
1.13.5.1.1. Pro: [We have a need to complete things](http://reflectd.co/2013/08/14/the-zeigarnik-effect-the-tendency-to-complete-things-that-were-left-incomplete/), leaving execution plans as mere plans might eventual be to much for some people.
1.13.5.1.2. Pro: [We are curious by nature](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201608/curiosity-the-good-the-bad-and-the-double-edged-sword), and that's not always a good thing, it's easy for the itch for knowledge to become an obsession, especially when one's life naturally revolves around a topic, even when that topic is ending one's life.
1.13.5.2. Con: We should not have mass executions, because that encourage manipulating the judicial process to have 'batches' of convicts, and/or to increase our use of the death penalty.
1.13.5.2.1. Con: The costs can be reduced to the cost of one bullet and 5 minutes if society was so willing.
1.13.5.3. Con: We should not have mass executions because such an impersonal practice is most defiantly inhuman, even if nothing else can be agreed upon, we can at least agree that end of life practices are inherently personal in nature, and should be treated as such.
1.13.6. Con: High costs of execution introduce unnecessary, avoidable arguments about what should be a moral conversation.
1.13.7. Con: -> See 1.13.5.2.1.
1.13.8. Con: -> See 1.2.11.4.1.3.
1.13.9. Pro: Replace it with life sentencing where prisoners have to work for their keep.
1.13.10. Pro: There has been a [shortage of lethal injection](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/14/us/pfizer-execution-drugs-lethal-injection.html?mcubz=1) drugs lately. This implicates practical problems for the future.
1.13.10.1. Con: A shortage would only result in longer death rows.
1.13.10.1.1. Con: Several states have recently executed many people in an effort to use their existing stockpile of chemicals prior to their being banned.
In the short term, this has actually lessened the average length of time on death row.[nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/opinion/arkansass-rush-to-execution.html)
1.13.10.2. Con: Current shortages don't necessarily imply future shortages.
1.13.10.3. Con: Only [China, Guatemala, Taiwan, Thailand, United States, and Vietnam](http://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/methods-of-execution.cfm) uses injection as a standard method. Alternatives are therefore readily available.
1.13.10.3.1. Pro: Firing squad would be the most humane alternative.
Once the heart has been stopped, unconsciousness is instantaneous.
The inmate feels no pain, and in the event of a 5-man firing squad the possibilities for all 5 to miss their shots is remote.
1.13.10.4. Con: The market should provide if a shortage of a good is faced.
1.13.10.4.1. Con: Many, [including the biggest](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/14/us/pfizer-execution-drugs-lethal-injection.html), pharmaceutical companies have blocked their products from being used in lethal injections based on either business or moral reasons.

Thus, the free market is not willing or able to provide the required drugs in the amounts that are needed.
1.13.10.5. Con: A bullet in the head is extremely effective and pain-free, not to mention very, very economical.
1.13.10.5.1. Pro: On top of that, [execution by firing squad](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-the-firing-squad-more-humane-than-lethal-injection/) is considered to be more humane than legal injections and the preferred method of some convicts.
1.13.10.6. Pro: Countries have stopped selling the "safe" lethal injections to the US; this has now caused the US to create [cocktails](http://www.livescience.com/51389-why-lethal-injection-is-getting-harder.html) that are even less safe, but make the final moments of the inmate dreadfull.
1.13.10.6.1. Pro: There have been several botched executions.[cen.acs.org](https://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i21/Botched-Executions-Put-Lethal-Injections.html)
1.13.10.6.2. Con: The Supreme Court on hearing medical evidence ruled that "[the sedative had not been proven more "cruel and unusual" than the alternatives](https://www.livescience.com/51389-why-lethal-injection-is-getting-harder.html)."
1.13.11. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.6.
1.13.12. Pro: Maintaining each death row prisoner costs [taxpayers](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty) $90,000 or more per year than a prisoner sentenced to life without possibility of parole in a max security prison.
1.13.12.1. Con: Several states have lowered that cost by [speeding up the pace to capital punishment](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2013/06/18/some-states-speed-up-death-penalty).
1.13.12.1.1. Con: The proposed plans include limiting people's ability to appeal. We should ask ourselves how much value these safeguards hold, and if it is worth the potential economic saving.
1.13.13. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.
1.13.14. Con: The benefits of public safety far outweigh the costs associated with the death penalty.
1.13.14.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.13.14.2. Con: "The additional cost of confining an inmate to death row, as compared to the maximum security prisons where those sentenced to life without possibility of parole ordinarily serve their sentences, is $90,000 per year per inmate." [deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty)
1.13.15. Pro: By the time criminals are executed, decades have passed since their crimes. They are no longer a threat to the public, and should be released instead.
1.13.15.1. Con: A dead person is not a threat to the public.
1.13.15.1.1. Con: The difference between a living person that won't kill you, and a dead person who won't kill you is not sufficient to justify the death penalty.
1.13.15.2. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that time alone reduces a persons violent instincts / mental abnormalities
1.14. Con: A majority of Americans are in favor of capital punishment, and their opinions should be reflected in the law.
1.14.1. Pro: According to a 2014 poll, most Americans [favor](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/25/death-penalty-poll_n_4661940.html) the death penalty as a punishment for people convicted of murder.
1.14.1.1. Pro: With the exception of 1967 all years since the beginning of recording in 1937 the majority was [in favor](http://www.gallup.com/poll/178790/americans-support-death-penalty-stable.aspx) of capital punishment.
1.14.1.2. Con: [Polls](https://theconversation.com/can-opinion-polls-ever-be-accurate-probably-not-61097) are rarely accurate representations of the [truth](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/11/08/what-opinion-polls-teach-us-about-data-versus-truth/#152700ca749f).
1.14.1.3. Con: Support for the death penalty has been falling over time.[deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/national-polls-and-studies)[statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/262929/opinion-of-us-citizens-on-the-death-penalty/#0)
1.14.1.4. Con: Taking into consideration the margin of error in polls, and the current \(2017\) ‘majority’ being 55%, this claim is untrue. [ropercenter.cornell.edu](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/support/polling-fundamentals-total-survey-error/)
1.14.2. Con: Majorities are not necessarily right.
1.14.2.1. Pro: Slavery was supported by a majority of the population for many centuries, prior to its abolition.
1.14.2.2. Pro: Capital punishment is a complex issue that many may be misinformed about. As such, the majority may not be best placed to make decisions of such magnitude.
1.14.2.2.1. Con: If public ignorance can be used as a reason to justify government overriding public opinion, then virtually all democratic processes could potentially be overridden. Case in point, the election of a president.
1.14.2.2.1.1. Con: The US democratic system has already, since its inception, been about finding a balance between public opinion and rules that govern legislation. The founding fathers knew that democracy could end in a tyranny of the majority if a group of voters takes power. Hence there are safeguards implemented along the way. In other words, we have always lived with rules that override public opinion \(these can be changed but it is more difficult to do so\), so this is an incorrect slippery slope.
1.14.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: As suggested, here is a link to the Federalist papers [on government checks and balances](https://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/primary-source-documents/the-federalist-papers/federalist-papers-no-51/) and preventing tyranny of the majority, which is an important part of American history.
1.14.2.3. Con: In our quest for the best possible correctness, a measured rule of majority values is the best system we have to get close to "right."
1.14.2.4. Pro: Truth and goodness can't be determined by consensus, they must be weighted against facts and virtue.
1.14.2.5. Pro: Bandwagon fallacy. A law does not always reflect the common morality of a country. Being popular doesn't inherently make you right.
1.14.2.6. Con: When it comes to opinions, it is difficult to determine who has the "right" one.
1.14.3. Con: Although a majority may still be in favor, support for capital punishment rapidly [declining](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/the-death-penalty-becomes-unusual/390867/). Legalizing capital punishment may not represent the majority opinion for much longer.
1.14.3.1. Pro: In 1996, 78% of Americans supported the death penalty. In 2015, [only 56%](http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/16/less-support-for-death-penalty-especially-among-democrats/) \(barely a majority\) were still in favor.
1.14.3.1.1. Con: When it comes to American politics, 56% is not "barely a majority." Presidents have been elected with slimmer margins.
1.14.3.2. Pro: In 2016, [recent polls](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/YearEnd2016) showed that support for the death penalty was at a 40-year low while support for alternative punishments was rising.
1.14.3.2.1. Pro: [A poll](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/5787) found a majority \(52%\) of Americans prefer life without parole as punishment for convicted murderers, with just 42% preferring the death penalty.
1.14.3.2.1.1. Pro: While a majority of Americans favor the death penalty rather than no death penalty, given the choice between the death penalty and life without parole, less people choose the former than do the latter.
1.14.3.3. Con: Laws can be changed back and forth. Legalizing something now does not mean it will never again be made illegal \(and vice versa\). As times change, so do laws.
1.14.4. Con: -> See 1.12.10.2.1.
1.14.5. Con: While the laws are definitely influenced by public opinion, it was never the intent that they always reflect them exactly. Power was given to Congress, elected by the people to make laws on their behalf. [The powers of Congress belong to Congress,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei) and not directly to the people, by design. Many other factors come into play when making a law as well.
1.14.6. Con: The majority must be taken into account when regarding politics, not the law. Decisions in law are reserved for those with legal training.
1.14.7. Con: Sometimes positive changes need to be introduced by leaders with a vision against the opinion of the general population. The death penalty was abolished in France in 1981 against the will of 62% of the French population. Public opinion later shifted.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_France)
1.14.7.1. Con: The role of politicians is also to educate the general public, and in cases of diffuse ingiustice they have a duty to intervene, even if this goes against the polls.
1.14.8. Con: A majority in a poll is not the same as a just decision making process.
1.14.8.1. Con: The majority view is the basis of democracy.
1.14.8.1.1. Con: The USA is a democratic republic.
1.14.8.1.2. Con: For the US version of democracy, this was considered untrue by the writers of the constitution. Their wariness of [tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority) is part of the reason that a pure/direct democracy was not used for the US. While the majority view might be the basis for a pure/direct democracy, it is not the case for the US version.
1.14.9. Pro: The Constitution was written and designed to protect minority interests from the encroachment of the majority. When legal policy, such as the death penalty, does not violate Constitutional protections, the will of the majority should prevail in establishing American law.
1.14.9.1. Con: Protecting minority interests is not the only constitutional protection. Protections against being "[deprived of life, liberty... \[without\] due process of law](https://www.aclu.org/united-states-bill-rights-first-10-amendments-constitution)" could be seen as protecting citizens from the death penalty, if the process of law can be proven flawed/imperfect \(as has been the case for those on death row who had convictions overturned\).
1.14.10. Pro: Commonly held notions of justice are the ultimate foundation of our justice system, and the measure by which its success should be judged. If a justice system diverges from the majority opinion of right and wrong, then it loses its moral force. A justice system with diminished moral force is diminished in itself.
1.14.10.1. Con: On the contrary, a justice system can *gain* moral force by diverging from the majority opinion of right and wrong.

At the time the UK government and courts ruled capital punishment impermissible, the majority public opinion was still in favour. The decision being correct in hindsight has only bolstered the authority of the justice system.
1.14.10.1.1. Con: Most Britons would not agree with this statement - so it is not true in regards to Britain.
1.14.10.2. Con: Applying morality to law is an infringment on religious freedom.
