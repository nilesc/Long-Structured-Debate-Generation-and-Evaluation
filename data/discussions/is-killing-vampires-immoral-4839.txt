Discussion Title: Is killing vampires immoral?

1. Killing Vampires is immoral.
1.1. Con: Vampires are a perversion of nature and so it is moral to kill them.
1.1.1. Con: If vampires were to exist it could only be because of a natural process, so they are therefore natural.
1.1.2. Con: This is dangerously close to eugenics. It is immoral to kill those who do not have 'ideal' or 'preferred' genetic makeups.
1.1.3. Con: It is a perversion of nature to be commenting on a newly formed internet forum called Kialo.
The perception of the 'Natural order of things' give no indication of morality.
1.1.4. Pro: [The Bible says "If any one of the house of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn among them eats any blood, I will set my face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from among his people."](http://www.inquisitivechristianity.com/index.php/faq/paranormal-faq/vampire-faq?id=155) There's really no other way but killing them.
1.1.4.1. Con: The bible is a *fictional* book and as such can not and does not provide justification for the needless murder of a sentient creature that has hopes and dreams and feelings.
1.1.4.2. Con: This passage makes no sense in this context. The narrator is describing THEIR actions without saying whether they are good or bad or prescribing what anybody ELSE should or shouldn't do.
1.1.4.3. Con: Vampires may or may not live in Israel. The value of a vampire's life should not depend on whether or not they live in or are from Israel.
1.1.4.4. Con: Of course, you can "cut" somebody "off from among his people" in all sorts of ways that don't involve killing them!
1.2. Pro: This depends on where the vampire stands on the issue of hunting for human blood. If the vampire does not believe in it, they should be allowed to live. If they do, it may be permissible to kill them. Regardless, all vampires can not be killed.
1.3. Con: Vampire movies would be boring if it weren't for the action, brought to us through the fights between vampires and some sort of hero.
1.3.1. Con: Morality isn't based on how entertaining something is.
1.3.1.1. Con: Under utilitarian ethics, this is not true. Entertainment increases ones well-being, thus it has utility, thus entertaining things are more morally valuable than boring ones. If enough people were enjoying violence against vampires, it may balance out the suffering of vampires, making the killing of them moral.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The more entertaining something is the more people will feel better. As such it enhances the collective wellbeing.
1.3.1.2. Con: Recent morality imposes itself on movies, as the ban of [Kevin Spacey](http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/upcoming-movies/staggering-cost-of-replacing-kevin-spacey-in-new-film/news-story/df1ef6c42f80b770268b40212f997978) from a recent movie after immoral conduct illustrates. Vampire movies would not be entertaining anymore because immoral conduct wouldn't be permissible.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Morality is its own branch of philosophy and therefore isn't related to entertainment. Hazing or bullying someone is entertaining for some people but is not morally right.
1.4. Con: In the case of self defense, one should be able to kill a predating vampire.
1.4.1. Con: One is also allowed to kill humans in self defense, but still most of us agree that killing humans is immoral.
1.4.2. Pro: In human law, homicide is [justifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justifiable_homicide) if there is sufficient evidence to prove that it was reasonable to believe that the offending party posed an imminent threat to the life or well-being of another. There is no reason why this law should not also apply to the murder of predatory vampires.
1.4.3. Pro: Assuming a vampire is approximately equally sentient to a human, vampires can be incorporated into normal moral principles.
This would allow "stand your ground" and other principles to apply. Therefore, a vampire could be killed in the same 'self defence' situations as a human could be killed.
1.5. Con: Killing sentient beings that kill humans saves humans and so is moral.
1.5.1. Con: Killing sentient beings no matter what they have done to humans is morally wrong.
1.5.2. Con: There are other options besides killing sentient beings.
1.5.3. Con: In the presence of a species or creature that is \(or may be\) equally sentient to a human, there is no reason to assume humanity is atop a moral hierarchy or the point of morality.
Therefore, the existential risk a vampire species may pose to humanity is insufficient moral justification for killing them.
1.5.4. Pro: Vampires' typically will murder multiple times in their life, even if they try not to. They are thus a danger to society and more lives would be saved if they were killed than if they remained alive.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Even when vampires try to lead moral lives, they are constantly struggling against their 'true' murderous nature.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Vampires in some fiction are shown to experience slips in self-control when bloodlust becomes too much, and end up killing or nearly killing humans regardless of whether this matches their ethics.
1.5.4.1.1.1. Con: Slips in control typically only happen to starving, 'young' or newly 'vegetarian' vampires. If older vampires who have become experts in self-control are allowed to live, they can guide younger ones down the same path with low risk to humans.
1.5.4.1.1.2. Pro: In the Twilight Saga, Jasper tries to [attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzmS7k5KTUE) Bella when she accidentally gives herself a paper cut and he smells her blood.
1.5.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Jasper is relatively [new](http://twilightsaga.wikia.com/wiki/Jasper_Hale) to the 'vegetarian' lifestyle adopted by the Cullens, hence why he is the only one who truly lacks the self-control required not to attack.
1.5.4.1.2. Con: Vampires who are committed to preventing harm become better and better at self-control over time. The longer they are allowed to live, the less danger they pose to humans.
1.5.4.1.2.1. Pro: [Carlisle](http://twilightsaga.wikia.com/wiki/Carlisle) Cullen \(from the Twilight Saga\) has never killed a human, and perfects this self-control over several centuries.
1.5.4.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.1.2.
1.5.5. Con: A vampire, which is naturally immortal and therefore has the potential for an eternity of existence and experience, is actually more morally valuable than humans for this reason, under some utilitarian and some consequentialist models of morality.
1.6. Con: Nothing means anything; there is no morality. Conflict between humans and vampires would be 'ecology as normal'; a completely amoral circumstance in which two species compete for space and resources.
1.6.1. Pro: We would not say that it is immoral that a lion kills an antelope, merely that it is the circle of life and a natural part of any harmonious ecosystem. Vampires hunting humans is no different.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Equally, a human defence mechanism of 'first strike' -- hunting vampires -- would also just be 'ecology as normal'.
1.6.2. Con: The ability to abstractly comprehend consequences and value \(which humans can\) begins to derive moral responsibility. Therefore, there are such a thing as morals, and human activity should not be considered simply 'ecology as normal'.
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.1.
1.6.4. Con: Since vampires are arguably human-like in their levels of intelligence and their potential for empathy and morality, it is not amoral to hunt and kill them.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Unlike a human hunting an animal, the vampire is aware of their own existence, aware of their future and capable of having a moral consciousness; this makes human-vampire violence less akin to the circle of life or humans killing animals, and more akin to a human-human violence.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: Some animals, like elephants, dolphins, and some primates, are self aware like humans are.
1.7. Pro: Killing sentient beings robs them of their right to live.
1.7.1. Con: Not all sentient beings have a right to live.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Beings like vampires are not truly alive, so cannot have a right to live regardless of whether they are sentient.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Although a "right to life" might not be the correct right to discuss, Vampires could still have their 'right to the pursuit of happiness' or the 'right to a family' or the 'right to a trial'.
1.7.1.2. Con: "Rights" may be the wrong perspective to answer the question posed by the motion.
"Rights" are a sociopolitical phenomenon, and we only recognise our sociopolitical system as including humans. We, therefore, decide what rights we would \(hypothetically\) protect for vampires.
It is therefore 'begging the question', either way, to equate the morality of killing vampires with their protected right to life.
1.7.1.3. Pro: Those who are sentenced to capital punishment lost their right to life.
1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.
1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.1.1.
1.8. Pro: Vampires can be turned into humans.
1.8.1. Pro: In the game the [Elders' Scrolls](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Sanguinare_Vampiris) vampires can be cured by shrines and potions.
1.8.2. Con: In many other vampire mythologies, once a newly-turned vampire has drank human blood, there is no turning back. \(According to [Supernatural](http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/index.php?title=Vampires) and others\).
1.8.2.1. Pro: There seems to be a moral component: Once a human has been harmed the remnants of humanity are gone.
1.8.3. Pro: In [the Blade trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_\(film_series\)), humans that had been turned into vampires were able to be turned back into humans.
1.8.4. Con: In [the Blade trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_\(film_series\)), born vampires weren't able to be converted into humans.
1.9. Pro: Vampires look like humans. This might lead to humans killing other humans accidentally.
1.9.1. Pro: In the Twilight Saga, Carlisle's human [father](http://twilightsaga.wikia.com/wiki/Carlisle) and other pastors led hunts for  vampires; however, these groups would often end up killing innocent citizens.
1.9.2. Con: Vampires don't look like humans in other mythologies.
1.10. Pro: There are solutions other than killing vampires to allow humans and vampires to coexist.
1.10.1. Pro: One solution could be that humans donate/sell blood and vampires buy the blood like humans buy their food.
1.10.1.1. Pro: If the vampires can't get sick \(like the ones from the Twilight series or the Vampire Diaries\), then it would be beneficial to use blood that isn't available to other humans, such as HIV-positive blood or [men who have sex with men](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/24/gay-men-donating-blood-discrimination-sex-lgbt-equality)'s blood. That way, they won't take away from human's blood, but still be fed enough and won't get too thirsty.
1.10.1.2. Con: This would take away from humans' blood - in other words, what if a human needs blood and can't get it because the vampires have bought it all?
1.10.1.2.1. Pro: Big nations such as the USA are constantly reporting major donated blood [shortages](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117954&page=1). Vampires cannot be catered for as well as humans.
1.10.1.2.2. Con: If we give vampire life the same value as human life, this situation would be no different than if a human could not get any blood because it had been used by other humans in need.
1.10.1.2.2.1. Con: Vampires can get blood from other sources than just humans; humans cannot get blood transfusions from any other source than other humans.This means that humans should be given priority over vampires when it comes to obtaining human blood.
1.10.2. Pro: Vampires \(such as the [Cullens](https://people.southwestern.edu/~bednarb/su_netWorks/projects/richards/MasculineRoles.html) in the Twilight saga or [Stefan Salvatore](https://people.southwestern.edu/~bednarb/su_netWorks/projects/richards/MasculineRoles.html) in The Vampire Diaries\) can learn to repress their bloodlust and practise self-restraint, so as not to present a danger to humans they share a community with.
1.10.3. Con: Will vampires adhere to those rules and solutions? They are pretty immoral because of the whole being vampires thing.
1.10.3.1. Con: Humans also have a long track record of backing out of solutions... that doesn't mean we shouldn't try.
1.11. Con: Vampires are inherently evil so there is no other solution for humans and vampires to co-exist other than killing them.
1.11.1. Con: Vampires such as the Cullens in the Twilight Saga and Stefan Salvatore in The Vampire Diaries display compassion towards human beings and a strong desire not to cause harm to them, thus suggesting that not all vampires are inherently evil.
1.11.1.1. Pro: The Olympic and Denali covens in the Twilight Saga all choose to hunt [only](http://twilightsaga.wikia.com/wiki/Vegetarian) animals, despite the fact that they would be more satisfied feeding on human blood. This is due to their sense of morality.
1.11.2. Con: Many vampires in various literature and film have not always been vampires, and started out life as humans. Their human attributes remain with them, to at least an extent, in their vampire life; they cannot therefore be inherently evil.
1.11.2.1. Pro: [Esme](http://twilightsaga.wikia.com/wiki/Esme_Cullen) Cullen, the adoptive mother of the Cullen 'children' in the Twilight Saga, is a vampire whose defining characteristic in human life was her ability to love; in her vampire life, she is portrayed as even more compassionate and loving.
1.11.3. Pro: A vampire's purpose is to drink humans' blood, which can kill humans. Killing humans is wrong, therefore they are wrong.
1.11.3.1. Con: Some vampires have been shown to drink non-human blood.
1.11.3.2. Con: How is this different from humans killing animals for sustenance?
1.12. Pro: Vampires are not inherently evil, and therefore there are other solutions that would allow humans and vampires to co-exist.
1.12.1. Pro: Vampires are put in a position - either socially or economically - that strongly encourages vampires to kill humans.
1.12.1.1. Pro: Most movies show vampires killing humans. Young vampires watching this will be socialized accordingly.
1.12.1.1.1. Con: [Carlisle](http://twilightsaga.wikia.com/wiki/Carlisle_Cullen) Cullen in the Twilight Saga creates and welcomes vampires to his coven and converts them to a compassionate lifestyle in which they never feed on humans. They all follow his lead.
1.12.2. Pro: There is no proof that they are inherently evil.
1.12.3. Con: Vampires across the board do have a track record of killing humans. This makes them evil.
1.12.3.1. Con: Human beings kill other animals to survive. If they are not considered evil because of this, it would be hypocritical to consider vampires evil.
1.12.3.2. Con: Pop-culture has plenty of vampires that sustain themselves using animal blood, synthetic blood or voluntary blood donations. Judging ALL vampires by the actions of the subset that kills humans is racist.
1.12.4. Con: When starving a vampire will eat humans.
1.12.4.1. Pro: They have in the past.
1.12.4.1.1. Pro: Vampires who are low on energy and have not been fed for a while are consistently depicted in films as having less self-control and being therefore more likely to give in to their primal instincts, killing humans to quench their thirst.
1.12.4.1.1.1. Pro: In the Twilight saga, "when a vampire becomes extremely thirsty they will do just about [anything](http://twilight.neoseeker.com/wiki/Eye_colour) to get blood of any type".
1.12.4.2. Con: Most species will eat other members of their species in the extreme case of starvation, that doesn't make them evil.
1.13. Con: A vampire killed my family member, so now all vampires need to die.
1.13.1. Con: Personal vendettas do not provide enough justification to kill all vampires.
1.13.2. Con: Personal vendettas do not provide enough justification to kill an entire species or group of beings.
1.13.2.1. Pro: A human may murder another human, that does not give anyone justification to end all of humanity.
1.14. Con: As vampires are already dead it is impossible to kill them.
1.14.1. Con: Since vampires meet the definition of [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life) , they are not dead. Scientific term is undead.
1.14.2. Con: It depends on how you define life and death.
1.14.3. Con: Viruses are technically not alive, but it is said that the immune system can "kill" them.
1.14.3.1. Con: When a biologist or doctor says that a virus has been killed they don't mean it literally.
1.14.4. Con: Moral concern may be more closely related to capacity to experience things than "life".
1.15. Con: Vampires don't exist, so this is all irrelevant.
1.15.1. Con: There is no proof that vampires don't exist.
1.15.1.1. Pro: Vampires appear in many works of literature, so there is reason to think they might have existed.
1.15.1.1.1. Con: Dragons, fairies and other mythological creatures also appear in works of literature.
1.15.2. Pro: There is no proof that vampires do exist.
1.16. Pro: Under utilitarian ethics, killing vampires is unethical.
1.16.1. Pro: Because they live longer, vampires have more potential for positive experience, and therefore killing them is worse then killing a human.
1.16.1.1. Con: Vampire lives are miserable as a result of their undeadness. Undead, including vampires, are in some mythologies implied to have no \(or just minimal\) positive emotions.
