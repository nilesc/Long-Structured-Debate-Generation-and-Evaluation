Discussion Title: The international community should work towards recognizing an independent Kurdish state

1. The international community should work towards recognizing an independent Kurdish state
1.1. Pro: An independent Kurdish state could help defuse ethnic conflicts involving their people across the region in the long term.
1.1.1. Con: It could also aggravate them and cause occasional flareups to turn into potential inter-state wars.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Kurdish forces from across the region have already showed the willingness to fight for fellow Kurdish liberty when Iraqi Kurdish fighters supported Syrian Kurdish fighters.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: The looming threat of an ISIS takeover in both countries was much more than just a flareup of ethnic tensions. It would have been absurd for the populations in both countries not to help each other during such a time.
1.1.1.2. Con: After years of civil war, the military capabilities of Iraq and Syria are depleted. Inter-state wars involving those actors are unlikely.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: The regimes Turkey and Iran however are always itching to craft and enemy and deepen a conflict to distract from dissatisfaction at home. A small scale war against a non-nuclear Kurdistan seems like just the kind of thing they'd go for.
1.1.2. Pro: A Kurdish independent state gives its people who constitute minorities in other countries additional protection, decreasing the likelihood of violent persecution.
1.1.3. Pro: An independent Kurdish state gives Kurdish minorities in other countries a palatable option other than violent resistance: migration to a country of their own.
1.1.4. Con: The borders of an independent Kurdish state need yet to be defined. Even the [Kurdish Project](https://thekurdishproject.org/kurdistan-map/) just maps the major population centres.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Erdogan in particular can be counted on to act aggressively and overbearingly in any sort of attempt to settle this matter amicably, while Assad might just go fully genocidal.
1.1.4.2. Con: This is probably the most important area for the international community to exert influence and where international pressure would be most warranted and most effective.
1.2. Pro: The Kurds have thus far generally demonstrated a sincere aspiration towards democracy and cooperation with the international community. A Kurdish state with these precepts could become a stabilizing force and productive regional partner.
1.2.1. Pro: Syrian Kurds in [Rojava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rojava#Community_government) do have direct democratic elections.
1.2.2. Pro: The Kurds directly assisted with the war on terror by going on the offensive against ISIS.
1.3. Pro: The state of Iraq failed to fulfill its obligation to protect its citizens in the face of the ISIS onslaught. This failure voids the social contract between that state and the people, giving a moral and legal justification for independence.
1.3.1. Pro: Historical persecution of the Kurdish people in countries in which they constitute minorities lends credence to the necessity of a Kurdish state.
1.3.2. Con: This assumes social contract theory; and social contract theory is false.
1.3.2.1. Con: International law gives people the right to chose who governs them
1.4. Con: The window of opportunity for Western support diminished with Assad's victory in Syria and Iraqi seizure of Kirkuk.
1.4.1. Pro: Iraqi and Turkish forces plan to conduct [maneuvres](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/iraq-turkey-forces-joint-drills-kurdish-vote-170926090905754.html) on their border.
1.4.2. Con: It merely depends on political will. While the Peshmerga are armed and organized and continue to hold the military and moral high ground, foreign support can still make a huge difference.
1.4.2.1. Con: Peshmerga fighters have received substantial foreign support which hasn't made a difference. [Germany](http://defence-blog.com/army/german-government-plan-to-give-peshmerga-forces-more-armored-vehicles-and-anti-tank-missiles.html), for example, send armored vehicles to help fight ISIS.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Pouring more armaments into the situation doesn't seem to be a wise approach going forwards.
1.4.2.1.2. Con: It has made a difference. The Kurds were one of the most effective, and earliest, forces fighting ISIS, in part thanks to foreign support.
1.4.2.2. Con: In Germany, there is political will to grant Kurdish activists a voice. A 17.000 [strong demonstration](http://www.dw.com/en/german-government-accused-of-toeing-turkish-line-over-kurdish-pkk-images/a-40609132) in favor of Abdullah Ocalan was allowed for example.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Turkey seems sure to use its status as a NATO member and key regional player, in particular in regards to the refugee crisis, to prevent foreign involvement with their ongoing ethnic conflict against the Kurds.
1.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: Turkey has threatened to end the [migrant deal](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39294776) before.
1.4.2.2.2. Con: Germany's massive and notoriously conservative Turkish population puts them in a more difficult situation in this regard, meaning they have to be really careful what they say and do, not only for foreign relations. This does not apply for other countries.
1.4.2.2.2.1. Con: Germany's Turkish population votes predominantly left wing. [76%](http://www.dw.com/en/how-will-turkish-germans-vote-in-the-countrys-upcoming-election/a-40229374) voted either for Social Democrats or the Green Party.
1.4.2.2.2.1.1. Con: But [60% of Turks in Germany supported Erdogan](http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/turkey/14052017) in the last election.
1.4.2.2.2.2. Con: Even though [Erdogan](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-21/german-election-will-tayyip-erdogan-swing-any-votes/8968872) called on German Turks to vote against Angela Merkel, Merkel was re-elected. This shows how unsucessful Erdogan's influence is.
1.4.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Though the Turkish population in Germany is large, it isn't large enough nor united enough to completely alter the course of a domestic election.
1.4.2.2.2.3. Pro: German Turks [vote](https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2017-03-23/turkish-campaign-germany-rising-tensions-between-berlin-and) for Erdogan in Turkish national elections.
1.5. Con: A move towards independence at the current time would likely prolong and intensify conflict in the region by sparking another civil war in Iraq.
1.5.1. Pro: A Kurdish military fight for independence would likely destabilize neighboring regions in Syria and Turkey.
1.5.2. Con: The Iraqi government has shown itself to be corrupt, undemocratic and heavy handed. Negotiating a peaceful Kurdish independence without the current position of strength  at a later date is illusory.
1.5.3. Pro: The Kurds themselves would suffer if civil strife and violence continued in Iraq.
1.6. Con: Kurdish forces themselves left Kirkuk. If the forces themselves do not want to fight for independence, foreign support cannot help.
1.6.1. Con: Leaving Kirkuk was probably the right choice in light of massive Iraqi firepower.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Strategic retreats are intelligent, not weak or apathetic.
1.6.2. Con: That's IF they didn't decide to retreat to avoid an outbreak of open hostilities and create more time for negotiations. The city wasn't part of the Kurdish Autonomous Region pre-ISIS.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Delaying and securing more time for diplomatic solutions is a logical move. Pursuing diplomatic solutions, and foreign support is the only chance the Kurds will have at creating an independent state. Escalating the violence prematurely will only hurt their chances.
1.7. Pro: The Kurds are a distinct national group and therefore deserve a state of their own.
1.7.1. Con: This assumes the antecedent, therefore is circular. The debate over whether Kurdistan deserve sovereignty is identical to the debate over whether they are a distinct national group.
1.7.2. Pro: There is a distinct [Kurdish language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_languages) which is a sign for a distinct nation according to [linguistic nationalism](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004365.html).
1.7.3. Pro: The [al-Anfâl genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfal_genocide) turned into a [lieu de memoire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Lieux_de_Mémoire) for the Kurdish nation in which historiy illustrate the continues oppression of the group.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Leiux de memoire are a common feature of groups that share a common memory of historical trajectories, such as [Germans](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erinnerungsort).
1.7.4. Pro: The [Kurdish Diaspora](http://www.tamilnation.co/selfdetermination/nation/kurdish-diaspora.pdf) clearly identifies with the ethnic group
1.7.5. Pro: Kurds hold the symbols of nationhood such as a [flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Kurdistan) and [anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2VPAJmz8qA).
1.7.6. Con: There is no affordance in international law that ethnicity, race, or religion is basis for a state
1.8. Con: The Kurdish forces oppress non-Kurds in the region and frequently commit acts of violence against them. The Kurdish state should fix their human rights record before they seek international legitimacy. \[1-2\]

1.9. Pro: Will allow Iran and Iraq more governable due to a reduction in the demographics of their populations.
1.10. Pro: Turkey's invasion of Afrin this week demonstrates that without a defined and defensible state of their own, the Kurds will continually fall foul of recurring attacks by regional powers when their influence wanes - now ISIS is mostly defeated, for example, losing the interest of the US - and when local rulers need to stir up hatred of Kurds for their own political ends - as currently with Erdogan.
1.11. Con: Rojava doesn't want to challenge the existing state boundaries of Syria, but marginalises state power and establish a democratic federational system, coexisting with the state of Syria. These ideas are based on writings of Abdullah Ocalan and inspired by Murray Bookchin. [thenational.scot](http://thenational.scot/news/15921458.Why_we_must_stand_up_for_the_hope_of_Rojava/)
1.12. Con: No third party country should interfere in internal affairs of another state. History proven us it never ends up well. An exception might be considered if international community considers Kurdish people to be mistreated in their origin country, in such case, countries that sign for it should protect that ethnicity by accepting them as refugees.
1.13. Con: Both Turkey and Iran are powerful neighbors with a vested interest in preventing the existence of an independent Kurdish state. Their involvement would likely lead to a dramatic escalation of violence.
1.13.1. Con: This simply reinforces the responsibility of the international community to step in and protect the Kurds from their hostile neighbors.
1.13.2. Pro: Both Turkey and Iran are in their own way key strategic players in their region and therefore necessary evils that must be "given some space" for the sake of maintaining working relationships.
1.13.2.1. Con: The cost of giving them "space" in this instance is unacceptably high.
1.13.2.2. Con: The authoritarian governments of these countries will profile themselves as and propagandize against "anti-imperialists/interventionists" no matter what the rest of the world does, so we might as well use our force and influence to do some good.
