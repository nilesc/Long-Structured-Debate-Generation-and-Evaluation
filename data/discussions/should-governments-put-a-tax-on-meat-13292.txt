Discussion Title: Should Governments Put A Tax On Meat?

1. Governments should put a tax on meat.
1.1. Pro: Since the price of meat does not reflect its true cost \(due to [subsidies](https://www.perc.org/2011/02/14/big-meat-and-big-government/)\), taxes would fill in to make the retail price closer to this.
1.1.1. Con: The subsidies mentioned are to help crop farmers.
1.2. Con: Adding a tax on meat would their prices cheaper yet, [due to dumping and predatory pricing](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/free-market-dumping.asp) pushing out domestic industries from the market. This would be detrimental, as foreign conditions are not as regulated as the US.
1.3. Con: Tax alone would not help the issues around meat. It should be combined with education about the problems of meat, an increase in lobbyists against meat, and so forth.
1.3.1. Con: [Tariffs decrease consumption of goods](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/tariff-trade-barrier-basics.asp), which would help to decrease consumption of meats \(due to the higher price of them\).
1.4. Pro: Meat production creates significant [greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.skepticalscience.com/how-much-meat-contribute-to-gw.html) which contribute to climate change.
1.4.1. Con: Meat as a whole food from pasture systems is carbon neutral or negative. It is just about the most sustainable food source we have. [holisticmanagement.org](https://holisticmanagement.org/feature-story/diet-best-planet/)
1.4.1.1. Con: The carbon emited from animals is not the primary factor which make meat an inefficient and unsustainable source of energy for the human body. The resources required to maintain, feed, house, transport, etc. make meat one of the least efficient and unsustainable means of delivering energy to the human body.
1.5. Con: In especially poor countries, people need the easiest access to all types of food. Tax would add costs to food production and decrease the country's food security.
1.6. Con: The meat tax is likely to have a greater impact on ethical providers of meat \(as their products are already more expensive\), while meat factories will still be able to compete in the market, causing an overall decrease of life conditions for livestock.
1.6.1. Pro: The increase in price will cause decrease in meat demand. This is accompanied by lower supply. Those suppliers, who provide more ethical environment for animals and consequently have lower margins, may not be able to compete anymore. On the other hand meat producing factories will be able to provide cheaper meat that will be preferable over the sustainably produced because with higher prices consumers are more price-sensitive.
1.7. Pro: Global soil health is being [devastated by grain and soy monocultures](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/16/meat-eaters-soil-degradation-over-grazing) used to feed most animals currently being raised for food.
1.7.1. Pro: Elsewhere, governments have put taxes on ecologically damaging business. ex\) [carbon tax](https://www.carbontax.org/where-carbon-is-taxed/) [oil tax](http://www.ey.com/gl/en/services/tax/global-oil-and-gas-tax-guide---country-list)
1.8. Con: Regenerative agriculture produces both meat and [environmental benefits](http://www.worldwatch.org/regenerative-animal-farming), but would be deterred by a meat tax.
1.9. Pro: Reduced demand for meat would slow or reverse the process of [deforestation](https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/deforestation).
1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.10. Con: Many people already find it difficult to afford food, and a [regressive tax on food](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/eating-meat-is-not-a-sin-that-should-be-taxed/article37465661/) would impose an additional burden.
1.10.1. Con: The money from taxes doesn't get burned, other taxes \(dependent on the location\) can be changed to "give" money to people who have difficulty paying their groceries.
1.10.2. Con: The additional burden could be only as small as changing your food consumption pattern.
1.10.3. Pro: Taxation is theft. Theft is immoral.
1.10.3.1. Con: By extension of this, no modern democracy is moral.
1.10.4. Con: Other sources of protein are currently cheaper than meat, providing alternatives to this added burden
1.11. Pro: North American citizens consume [more meat](https://www.elementascience.org/articles/10.12952/journal.elementa.000116/) than dietary guidelines recommend.
1.11.1. Pro: Curbing meat consumption would [reduce health care costs](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/03/the-economic-case-for-worldwide-vegetarianism/475524/).
1.12. Con: A tax on meat could actually reduce tax revenues by harming multi-billion industries that currently pay corporate taxes.
1.12.1. Pro: Since meat is subsidized, focus should start there first.
