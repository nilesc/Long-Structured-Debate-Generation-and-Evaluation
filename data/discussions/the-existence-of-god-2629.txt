Discussion Title: The Existence of God

1. [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism) exists.
1.1. Con: The [classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism) definition of God is contradictory or incoherent, and thus God cannot in principle exist.
1.1.1. Con: It is not contradictory to be all powerful, all knowing, and perfectly good. One is about ability to act, one is about ability to know, and one is about moral evaluation of actions or character.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Having abilities to act does not restrict knowledge or constitute moral flaws, having abilities to know does not restrict abilities to act or constitute moral flaws, and while moral goodness may lead one to not act some way, it does not make one unable to act in any way or know anything. No contradiction
1.1.1.1.1. Con: This inadvertently minimises the claim by leaving out the omni aspect.
'Having abilities to act' is an imperfect claim that falls short of omnipotence.
Omnipotence restricts knowledge and restricts moral perfection.
Being able to perform anything means one cannot know what they are incapable of performing \(reduction in knowledge\), it also means they are less morally perfect than a being incapable of evil \(reduction in moral perfection\).
The interaction between the three generates contradiction.
1.1.1.2. Pro: It is coherent and consistent to be perfectly good. It means, at least, that all actions performed by the perfectly good thing are morally permissible. All these concepts are clear and coherent, and being so for every action is not any more incoherent than doing good in some single action.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: To presume perfect good is to presume a complete picture of morality is known, which it is not, and this is not a problem that can be skirted by the bald assertion of perfection.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: A question to highlight the competing tensions within omnipotence.
Is god perfectly just or perfectly merciful?
Being just means individuals get what they deserve.
Being merciful means leniency is shown.
Any increase in justice decreases mercy, and the converse.
It cannot logically be both.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Omniscience means to know the truth value of all \(non-devious\) propositions. Some propositions like, "This proposition is false" make for interesting puzzles in philosophical logic, but do not impact omniscience. If there is some truth to be known, something omniscient knows it. If not, then it doesn't.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: An omniscient being would not know how it feels to be ignorant. While it is logically possible to experience one's ignorance, God is incapable of ignorance. This is an essential contradiction.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Omniscience deals with knowledge, while impassability deals with experience. One can certainly have knowledge of things without having experienced them.
1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: I can have the knowledge of women, yet I fail to experience how does it feel to be one. The parent claim specifically says that this first hand experience is what God lacks. Impassability is about having the experience but not being affected, or "touched" by it, but then that "touch" is just one step away experience that God lacks.
1.1.1.3.1.1.2. Con: The parent claim introduced ignorance as emotion. I mentioned fear as the experience of an emotion. Your argument should move one level up.
1.1.1.3.1.1.3. Pro: As human beings, some knowledge is only available to us via experience since it's impossible to accurately describe emotions and we cannot predict accurately how something will feel. This is where God differs as he can predict perfectly what would be the emotions attached to an experience without living it.
1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: According to his own claim, Jesus is God incarnated as human, and thus would have experienced ignorance.
1.1.1.3.1.3. Con: The concept of omniscience in Hinduism associated with the God as the Supersoul \([Paramatma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramatman)\) incorporates the limits of knowledge through the notion of omnipresence.
1.1.1.3.1.4. Con: The paradox created by an omniscient God being unable to know ignorance does not make omniscience logically impossible, it merely provides further evidence that paradoxes are common in nature.
1.1.1.3.1.5. Con: This assumes that "you have to be one to know one", that is, that to know what an experience is like you need to have had that experience. While it may be hard for people to gain knowledge of what others' experiences are truly like, there is no contradiction in the idea of such knowledge.
1.1.1.3.1.6. Con: This confuses knowledge how and knowledge that. Omniscience only means to know all true propositions, but it says nothing about having particular experiences, such as experiencing ignorance.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: God cannot know if there is something that he does not know. Thus his knowledge must be incomplete contradicting omniscience.
1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: For God to know what He does not know that He does not know, He would have to know what He does not know that He does not know, which is self-contradictory. Therefore, whether such thing exists, its existence is fundamentally unknowable no matter how much God knows.
1.1.1.4. Con: Assuming morality of "good" and "evil" behaviors exists, an entity possessing complete knowledge must be be immoral, not just moral-good as knowledge of experience of only good would be incomplete knowledge.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: This presents a misunderstanding of omniscience. Omniscience is typically defined as "knowing every true fact". This does not require experiential knowledge of immorality.
1.1.1.4.2. Con: God is not subject to any external standard of morality. As the ultimate metaphysical reality and the creator of all things created, His character and behavior is the very standard of morality by which all actions by moral agents are judged to be good or evil. 

Therefore, God is not technically "good", as that phrasing implies that He conforms to an external standard of goodness. Rather, He is Goodness Personified.
1.1.1.5. Con: The contradiction comes from the interaction between two or more omni characteristics. If you have perfect ability to act a realm of knowledge is restricted \(knowledge about your limitations to act\), also your moral character is reduced \(you are less morally perfect than something incapable of evil\). This contradiction can be expressed from the perspective of any omni claim.
Add another omni such as omni-present same contradictions. One omni, logically consistent. Two or more, inconsistent.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: A being that is both omniscient and omnipotent would not be lacking knowledge about their limits, but rather would have a perfect knowledge that they have no limits.
1.1.1.6. Con: Any moral reasoning comes from a compilation of traditions. As the word, from latin \<\<mores\>\> means "A set of norms or customs derived from generally accepted practices rather than written laws" An omniscient, eternal entity can have no morality, nor set of customs compiled through practice.
1.1.2. Con: The logical inconsistencies of Classical Theism could simply be the result of faulty reasoning, in such a case God could still exist.
1.1.2.1. Pro: There is no clear classical definition of God, because the [attributes](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Classical_theism) of God are not well defined.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: The attributes of God were clearly defined in the parameters of this discussion. No other attributes are relevant to this discussion.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: All of the attributes of God have a proper definition.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Omnibenevolence cannot be properly defined because goodness cannot be objectively defined.
1.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Omnipotence means that God can actualize any possible world.
1.1.2.1.2.3. Pro: Omniscience means that God possesses knowledge of all possible and actual states.
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: There are multiple and sometimes contradicting versions of God between different religions, and even within religions people sometimes do not agree on a single definition.
1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The fact that people who disagree strongly about the nature of God, particularly across different cultures and history who agree on very little, can still agree on the existence of God tends to provide more evidence for the existence of God than against it.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Agreeing on the existence of gods of strongly distinct natures only provide an evidence that God is not a unified concept.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: It is perfectly coherent to believe that most religions simply have a flawed/incomplete/different experience or understanding of the same God, so it's not necessary to reject every doctrine of their belief or declare that they're entirely wrong. This belief is called [inclusivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusivism).
1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: That is effectively stating that either polytheists or monotheists are wrong, as to why, is irrelevant. Both cannot be right at the same time.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Prior to modern archeology, many cultures discovered dinosaur bones and called them dragons. The fact that they were wrong about many of the attributes of dinosaurs doesn't mean we have to completely reject their experience of fossils.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: There are many competing [interpretations of quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics#Summary_of_common_interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics), but the fact that only one of them can be entirely right doesn't mean that we are forced to reject all of them, or to reject quantum theory itself.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.3.1. Con: All interpretations of quantum mechanics are "true" in that they all explain the same laws of physics, so they are compatible with each other.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.4. Pro: God may have revealed Himself in different ways to suit different cultures, and to help them with their specific spiritual journey.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: That would in fact be what a God who was good as defined by the classical definition would do. We know that problems are very different and require different approaches and solutions.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.5. Con: There's no value in an unknowable God. By saying many/all religions have a flawed/incomplete/different understanding of the same god it brings humanity no closer to understanding God - if anything it makes it harder because you'd have to sift through many or all beliefs looking for bits of truth.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1.2. Con: "Agreeing on the existence of gods" is only proof of individual choices. In other words, this is only proof of humanity's free will and the fact that people may choose what to believe in. This is not "evidence". This is "belief" and people choose their own beliefs without proving anything else then their own possibility of choosing what to believe.
1.1.2.1.3.1.2. Con: For this to be true, you need first to define God. The term is highly subjective and interpreted differently by everyone. If I say God is a teapot and you say God is a prime number divisible by 6, then obviously my God exists and your doesn't, which says nothing about some universal definition of God.
1.1.2.1.3.1.3. Con: People agree on the existence of God because they have something in common - paranoia - innate cognitive bias to commit false-positive errors rather than false-negative errors, and thus overinfer personal, intentional, and animate forces behind otherwise perfectly natural phenomena. [Source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200803/why-do-we-believe-in-god-ii).
1.1.2.1.3.1.4. Con: Belief in a thing is not evidence of the thing's existence.
1.1.2.1.3.1.5. Pro: In science, a lot of knowledge is based on data that repeats over and over. The repetition of similar ideas and images from religions that have no connection to each other is common. Therefore, there must be some sort of being that is omnipresent into our reality.
1.1.2.1.3.1.5.1. Con: Just like languages borrow words from each other, many religions borrow concepts from older or concurrent religions and mythology. This can explain why ideas are sometimes repeated without necessarily being true.
1.1.2.1.3.1.5.1.1. Pro: The story of Noah's Ark borrows heavily from the [Epic of Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh_flood_myth).
1.1.2.1.3.1.5.2. Con: This data could just as easily support a claim about humanity itself and a psychological impulse to explain the unknown.
1.1.2.1.3.1.5.2.1. Pro: That psychological impulse is, in other words, "innate cognitive bias to commit false-positive errors rather than false-negative errors" \([Satoshi](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200803/why-do-we-believe-in-god-ii)\).
1.1.2.1.3.1.6. Pro: Perhaps each of these religions is partially correct, some of them more correct than others but none of them absolutely correct. Those accounts which are common among all religions can be thought to be very likely true.
1.1.2.1.3.1.6.1. Con: If God could communicate truth there would be no reason to have much difference at all between religious claims. Even supposing that at some point that truth got distorted, God could still correct us. Therefore, people having to compare religions and decide what comes \(or does not come\) from God is evidence that there is no God that communicates.
1.1.2.1.3.1.6.1.1. Con: Communication is dependent on both the sender and the receiver. The existence of a perfect sender does not imply perfect communication when sending to an imperfect receiver.
1.1.2.1.3.1.6.1.1.1. Con: The communicating is not just sending information, it includes the reception of information. The existence of such a perfect sender would certainly imply better transmission and reception than wildly inconsistent revelations.
1.1.2.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: If done today would imply a perfectly received message, which would be recorded and passed on without relevant change, as is the case with any minimally competent youtuber.
1.1.2.1.3.1.6.2. Con: If God could communicate He could also correct people. People having to compare religions and decide that comes from God makes it unlikely that there is any God communicating.
1.1.2.1.3.1.6.2.1. Con: The conclusion doesn't follow from the premise; parents are often ignored by children who simply do not want to be corrected.
1.1.2.1.3.1.6.2.2. Con: Those holding this position must show that God would want to "correct people" in the precise way that they have in mind. Perhaps God does correct persons, but in a different manner. 

For instance, Christianity holds that God has given and preserved His word in the Bible, and that scripture is available to correct us. Hindus adherents would hold that Karma serves as a corrective or retributive force.
1.1.2.1.3.1.7. Pro: Many religions that describe God with different natures may be looking at different beings.  For example most Monotheistic religions see a creator God, while the polytheistic religions describe spirits of powers, much like the Angels and Demons are described in Monotheistic religions.  Individual reported experiences could be true but mis-understood.
1.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: The God of the Bible is contradictory, as God's character, wishes, directions, laws and outlook all change between the old and new testaments.
1.1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: Between the old and new testament, it's not God that changes, but people and their perception of him.
1.1.2.1.3.2.1.1. Con: This is not scripturally true. The nature of God varies even throughout the old testament. The story of Noah is probably the most well-known example thereof. \[Genesis 8:20\]
1.1.2.1.3.2.2. Con: The New Testament begins with the arrival of Jesus Christ who is the tool used to change God's systems of worship, repentance, and redemption. God's character, wishes, and outlook do not change. The purpose of His law changes, but not the laws themselves. His directions change as necessary according to the fulfillment of Christ's mission \(a holy life, death, burial, resurrection, and identification after resurrection.\)
1.1.2.1.3.3. Pro: There is no consistency between religious texts, different sects and anecdotal experiences.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1. Pro: As a believer of any religion, you have to believe that you are right while all the contradicting religions are wrong. There is no evidence to support such statements, as the evidence for most religions is of similar value, individual experiences and \(old\) man-written texts.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Most people believe that all faiths, besides theirs, are wrong. Thus, on average, all religions are being rejected by all people, besides the individual believers of a particular faith.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: As an example, as a Catholic you have to believe that the Protestants are wrong, both cannot be right at the same time. But there is no way of evaluating which one is truer.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: There are many ways of evaluating the relative correctness of any given religion.

Historicity, authority, logical coherence, practical results, and anecdotal experience are just some of the ways to evaluate which one is more correct.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Most religions contradict themselves in their own texts, so that is a poor measure of comparison.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: As an example, the Bible contradicts itself in hundreds of [locations](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/08/19/an-incredible-interactive-chart-of-biblical-contradictions/).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The different books of the Bible were written by many independent authors, and it's perfectly coherent to believe that many or all of them were mistaken about certain specific facts.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The vast majority of cited biblical contradictions are not true contradictions in the sense that they plainly state both X and ~X.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Two biblical passages do not contradict only because they are hard to understand together and need further study in order to reconcile.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: True contradictions occur only when there is no possible way for two separate statements to be true at the same time and in the same way.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: It is impossible to ascertain that Catholicism is more correct than Judaism.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: It is possible through historical research to determine with reasonable accuracy whether or not Jesus rose from the dead.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Historical research is often done to evaluate the claims of the Gospel accounts.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: If a religion contradicts itself then that is a mark against the correctness of that religion. Therefore, logical coherence is a factor that can be used to evaluate relative correctness.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: A monotheist must believe that all polytheistic religions are wrong.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.3. Pro: As a polytheist you have to believe that all monotheistic religions are wrong.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.4. Pro: Some believers hold that those of other faiths are unknowingly worshiping the God of their own faith.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.4.1. Con: Believers of certain faiths disagree with the nature of gods of other faiths because of what they accept as positive proofs for the nature of their god, rather than simply making a positive statement about the non-existence of the others' god.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.4.2. Con: The testimony of men can disagree on the full nature of a god which they believe they have witnessed holds more weight on the argument for that god's existence than any number of men who simply say that they saw nothing yet.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.5. Con: Atheism is rejected by people of almost all other faiths and beliefs. Thus, Atheism is rejected by more people, throughout history, than any other faith.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.5.1. Con: Atheism is not a faith. Atheism is, by definition, a lack of belief. Believing in something doesn't make it true, and yet deep-seated beliefs tend to be strongly defended. Atheism is a rejection of deep-seated, unreliable beliefs.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.5.1.1. Con: The claim that "atheism is not a faith" is a thinly-veiled attempt to avoid having to defend one's own position. Denial of one truth claim necessarily entails the embrace of other truth claims. Indeed, this very claim calls theism "unreliable"... a claim that, it must be assumed, the claimant believes.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.5.1.2. Con: The proper term for one who simply lacks belief is "agnostic"... literally "no knowledge". The term "atheist" literally means "no God", and implies at a minimum an affirmation that God indeed does not exist.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.6. Con: The strong, nearly universal debate about the nature of a thing, tends to more confirm the existence of that thing in some form than to confirm that it does not exist. It implies at the very least that there are many people who suppose they have a reason for that belief.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.7. Con: The fact that many people believe something says nothing about the truth value of that thing. To presuppose so is the fallacy of [argumentum ad populum](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Argumentum_ad_populum).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Believers of one faith, just like atheists, have no way of proving a negative, unless blatant contradictions are made in specific faiths \(e.g. the world will end and it doesn't..\)
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: It is impossible to prove that there is no deist God who created the world and then turned their back on it.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.2.2. Pro: It is impossible to prove that there are no fairies.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.2.3. Con: A specific failed claim does not invalidate the entire basis of a faith. It is possible that those making the claim \(i.e. that the world would end in 1912\) were mistaken. The rest of the claims of the faith must be evaluated on their own terms.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4. Con: The evidence in favor of different religions differs wildly. Thus, there is reason to believe one religion is correct and the others are wrong.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.1. Pro: If a true God would not allow his religion to die, then it is necessarily the case that all the myriad pagan religions which have died off are false, and one of the currently existent religions must be true.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.1.1. Con: There is no reason for us to belive that a true God would not allow his religion to die and, as it stands, it is a mere speculation.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Most religions have a "free will" notion which would not be possible if God "would not allow" his religion to die as that would be violation of the free will.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2. Pro: There is good evidence to support belief in Christianity.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: Jesus [fulfilled 108 Old Testament prophecies](http://christinprophecy.org/articles/applying-the-science-of-probability-to-the-scriptures/) regarding the Messiah.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: It is extraordinarily unlikely that any single person, let alone one who claimed to be the Messiah and is still believed to be to this day, would fulfill all of these prophecies by pure chance.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: One estimate for the likelihood of meeting only 48 of the 108 Messianic prophecies Jesus fulfilled [places it at 1 in 10^157](http://christinprophecy.org/articles/applying-the-science-of-probability-to-the-scriptures/), which is much larger than the total number of Jews, or even humans, ever born.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.1.2. Con: We have not established that Jesus existed, let alone fulfilled any “prophecies”.  One book containing fragments of stories pieced together years after the events, does not constitute reliable evidence.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: The Bible provides historical evidence for the existence of God.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1. Con: Nearly all ancient history contains mentions of miracles and gods, regardless of how accurate it is considered otherwise. The typical method of historians is to accept the testimony regarding the more mundane events but reject the miracle claims.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1. Con: If accounts of miracles are systematically rejected, rather than assessed on their individual merit, then the method of investigation would fail to identify miracles even if they genuinely did occur. Any method that systematically rejects miracles \(or any truth claim\) is therefore inadequate to the task of determining the truth of the claim.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: While that may be valid, there is no reason why for example Greek or Roman Gods aren't just as valid as the Christian God, according to Homer's Odyssey and many others.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Miracle claims can be investigated on their individual merit and either accepted or rejected based on evidence in the same way as any other historical claims. There is no need to accept all miracles as soon as you're willing to accept any of them.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: There exists historical evidence for Jesus's divinity outside of simply the claims made about him.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: There are many historical events, which are accepted to have happened by the majority of scholars regardless of whether the New Testament is reliable, which are better explained by the resurrection of Jesus than by any competing naturalistic hypothesis.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many people believed that they had some sort of experience of Jesus after his death.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: This is attested to by multiple independent sources, including Josephus, Paul, and all four Gospels and Acts. This is also preserved in earlier creeds, such as 1 Corinthians 15:3-7.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: It is possible that belief in the resurrection was due to hallucinations.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Most postmortem appearances were to multiple witnesses at once, with at least one report of a large group appearance \(to 500 people at once\). Group hallucinations are incredibly rare, with no known formally documented case, so this is unlikely to have happened multiple times.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Witnesses reported seeing, hearing, and sometimes touching the resurrected body. Hallucinations typically only influence one sense, with simultaneous hallucinations in many senses \(such as these\) being incredibly rare, so this is unlikely to have happened multiple times.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3. Con: If all the witnesses of the resurrected body of Jesus were hallucinating, it's unlikely that their accounts of what he said and did would agree to the extent that they do, since his words and actions would be created independently in each of their minds.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.4. Con: If the witnesses of the resurrected body were hallucinating, they likely would have concluded that it was only a vision rather than a bodily resurrection, since we know that both their culture and the specific individuals involved had a concept of spiritual visions.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.4.1. Pro: In Acts 12:14-15, a servant tells members of the early Church that Peter had escaped from prison, and she is dismissed with the claim that it was only his angel. This shows that the early Church wasn't quick to assume that the appearance of someone is necessarily their physical presence.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: It's possible that early belief in the resurrection was fabricated by later generations.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: None of the written accounts of Jesus' life, death or supposed resurrection are first-hand accounts \(in fact, they were written decades after his death by people who never met him or saw him in person\). While they might be useful as supporting evidence, they aren't valid as primary sources.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: The authorship of the New Testament books is debated by historians, with some evidence that they were written either by eyewitnesses or by scribes based on the stories of eyewitnesses.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The authorship of the Gospels \(matching the names attached to them today\) is attested by many different members of the early Church from across the ancient world, despite no internal clues to their authorship and at a time when there was no central leadership of the Church to enforce such a doctrine.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Mark and Luke were companions of Peter and Paul, respectively, but are not themselves relevant to the Gospel narrative. If the Church was just assigning authors to the Gospels, they would have chosen more important authors \(such as Jesus's original disciples\), like the Gnostic Gospels did, rather than unknown names like these.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.3. Pro: The authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews was debated within the Church at least as early as the third century AD. If the Church simply assigned authors to New Testament books without reason, it would have done so to Hebrews as well and there wouldn't have been such a debate.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.4. Pro: There is no known claim from the time, either within or outside the Church, that disputes the commonly attested authorship of the Gospels.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.5. Pro: It is almost universally accepted by historians that most of the letters attributed to Paul were indeed written by the apostle Paul, who claims to be an eyewitness to the resurrected body.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Most if not all of the books of the New Testament are dated within the lifetime of eyewitnesses \(even by conservative scholars\), meaning they could be interviewed about their experiences and would likely notice any discrepancy with what they experienced.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.3. Con: The amount and dates of extant accounts of Jesus's ministry and resurrection are outstanding in ancient history, where writing by eyewitnesses is not common, expected, or required when questioning ancient historical events.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: The first surviving account of Alexander the Great's life came ~200 years after his death, with the next not appearing until ~200 years after that.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.4. Con: It is typically accepted by historians that the Gospel narratives were preserved by [oral tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_gospel_traditions) in the time between Jesus's death and the writing of the four Gospels.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.4.1. Pro: Oral tradition was much more reliable at the time, when reading and writing were uncommon, and especially among Jewish communities. This tradition is even continued into this day, with sections of the Torah being memorized and recited for bar mitzvahs.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.5. Con: The date of New Testament books is debated by historians, with some evidence that they were written fairly early, and some portions such as [the creed in 1 Corinthians](https://beliefmap.org/bible/1-corinthians/15-creed/date/) being reliably and uncontroversially dated to within a few years of Pentecost.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.5.1. Pro: Many secular historians date the book of Mark to after 70 AD because it contains a prophecy of the destruction of the Second Temple, which occurred that year. However, this assumes not only that Jesus couldn't have made a correct prophecy, but also that it couldn't simply be apocalyptic language echoing the earlier destruction of the temple.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.5.1.1. Pro: Atheist historian Maurice Casey argues that Mark was written in the AD 40's by correlating Mark 13:14 with the Caligula crisis when the emperor threatened to set up his statue in the Temple, proposing that Mark’s translations of Aramaic sources was still unrefined, and insisting that Mark assumes Torah observance before major debates on the issue \(e.g. Jerusalem Council\).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.5.2. Pro: Many secular historians argue that Mark must have been the first Gospel to be written, since it is the shortest, and later Gospels were based on it. However, this idea is not universally accepted, with many arguing that [Matthew came before Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustinian_hypothesis#Modern_position_in_detail).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: There is insufficient evidence that Jesus Christ existed at all.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Virtually all New Testament scholars and Near East historians, applying the standard criteria of historical investigation, find that the historicity of Jesus is effectively certain.

See [details on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Christianity started with the belief in a new deity, named Jesus, "who was later historicized" in the Gospels, which are "essentially allegory and fiction".

See [details on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_myth_theory)
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.2. Con: There are [multiple early sources](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/jesus-historical-jesus/did-jesus-exist/) outside of the Bible \(and outside of Christian sources\) that refer to Jesus.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Jesus is not God in the sense of [classical theism​](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.2.2. Con: Historical Jesus is not necessarily "the son of God". The existence of a certain man doesn't verify the existence of God. Any man could claim to be the son of God.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.3. Con: [An ossuary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ossuary) has been discovered that bares the name of St. James, and mentions Jesus by name, thus providing [archaeological evidence](http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=43671) for his existence.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.3.1. Con: There were a lot of people named James and Jesus at that time.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.3.1.1. Con: Professor Camil Fuchs of Tel Aviv University has concluded that at the time [there would be ~1.71 people](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/news/brother-of-jesus-proved-ancient-and-authentic/) in Jerusalem named James with a brother named Jesus and a father named Joseph, making it very likely that the inscription refers to St. James.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.3.1.2. Con: [Only one other ossuary](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/news/brother-of-jesus-proved-ancient-and-authentic/) has been discovered with the brother of the deceased mentioned, meaning such a mention was likely reserved for notable/famous relatives.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.4. Pro: [On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26355865M/On_the_Historicity_of_Jesus)  by Richard Carrier provides evidence that Jesus Christ did not exist.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.4.1. Con: Carrier's claims have been [repeatedly](https://historyforatheists.com/2017/05/did-jesus-exist-the-jesus-myth-theory-again/) [criticized](https://historyforatheists.com/2016/07/richard-carrier-is-displeased/).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.5. Pro: No current living being has directly seen Jesus Christ.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.5.1. Con: No currently living person has seen Abraham Lincoln, but few people deny that he ever existed.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.5.1.1. Con: Evidences for the existence of Abraham Lincoln are more reliable and recent that clues of the existence of Jesus Christ.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Evidence for the existence of Jesus Christ are more numerous, recent, and reliable than those for the existence of Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, or any other given figure from antiquity. Rejecting Jesus requires rejecting nearly all of ancient history.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.6. Pro: Historical evidence can be very vague, altered or outright be completely fake. Just because the old/new testament says Jesus existed doesn't mean that it's true. It becomes humanly impossible to trace back every historical evidence that mentions someone who could have been Jesus. The only possible solution would be to digitize everything and let a super computer build a web of correlations between evidence.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.6.1. Con: There are a number of disciplines \(history, geography, archeology, anthropology, philology, palaeography and more\) which aim to determine historical evidence's validity and set standards which the sources must meet in order to be considered reliable and useful.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.6.1.1. Con: The fact that disciplines aim to trace back sources does not guarantee that they succeed in it with high enough standards.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.5.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: It's possible that Jesus didn't actually die on the cross, instead falling unconscious and awakening later.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Crucifixion involved running nails through the victim's hands and feet, as well as a wound from a spear to ensure death before being removed. Even if Jesus didn't die from the execution itself, he would have bled out before he awoke inside the tomb.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.2. Con: After crucifixion it was common for a soldier to thrust a spear into the victim's side to ensure that they are dead, making it unlikely that it would go unnoticed if Jesus was still alive.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.3. Con: We have no records of anyone surviving crucifixion without immediate medical care.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.4. Con: If Jesus did survive the crucifixion, he would likely be too weak and injured to move the rock at the entrance to the tomb.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.5. Con: The accounts of Jesus's postmortem appearances don't imply that he was weak, visibly injured, or in need of help after being found alive, although this is what we'd expect if he survived his crucifixion.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Skeptics came to believe that Jesus was risen from the dead, despite not following his ministry while he was alive.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: James, the brother of Jesus, did not believe Jesus's claims during his life, but was converted by postmortem appearances and went on to become a leader in the Church and ultimately be martyred for his faith, according to Josephus.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: It is unlikely for someone to willingly be killed for something that they know to be false.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: A more accurate statement would be "It is unlikely for someone to willingly be killed for something that they 'believe' to be false."
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.2. Con: Those who believe in God don't realize that their love for god blinds them, preventing them from logically assessing the decision to be a martyr.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.3. Con: Being willing to die for a belief has no bearing on the truth of said belief. It only shows that the person likely believes said claim.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.4. Con: There are examples of people dying for false beliefs, as is the case with [various breatharians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmuheen#Deaths_of_followers).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.5. Con: There was a breatharian who offered herself to die on record for 60 Minutes for a belief that was proven false and which would have been impossible for her not to know it was false: [Jasmuheen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnCuzUd4eC0).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.6. Con: How unlikely it is that someone would be willing to be killed for a false belief depends on the perceived risk of being killed, the possible rewards and the tolerance of the individual to risk.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2. Pro: It's unlikely that early Christian writers would claim that a prominent leader in the Church was once a nonbeliever if it wasn't true.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.3. Pro: It is unlikely that someone would lie about their belief in the resurrection, since the early Church was persecuted and largely powerless from the beginning, with no personal gain to be had.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.4. Pro: The Apostle Paul was an enemy of the early Church, but was converted a postmortem experience of Jesus and went on to become a leader in the Church and ultimately be martyred for his faith.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.4.3. Pro: Paul's testimony that he was once an enemy of the Church meets the [criterion of embarrassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_of_embarrassment).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.4.4. Pro: Paul was a respected scholar and was making a name for himself by persecuting the Church, so he would have nothing to gain by joining the Christians.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.3.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.5. Con: This is begging the question - without first establishing the new testament is factual without doubt we cannot reasonably assume a story about skeptics changing their mind \(Paul, James\) is true.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The Apostles preached the resurrection immediately in Jerusalem, where the Jewish and Roman authorities were already prepared to combat them, rather than waiting or beginning their ministry elsewhere.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: The Roman historian Tacitus mentions that after Jesus's death, Christianity first began to rise in Judea.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: Cults are typically formed far away from or long after the events they preach, to avoid being persecuted or disproven.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Following Jesus's death, the tomb he was buried in was discovered to be empty.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: If the tomb was not empty, Christianity would have fallen apart when someone other than the Disciples went to check the tomb and found Jesus's body.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: The Gospels report that Jesus was buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, a member of the Sanhedrin. The location of his tomb would be known, making it easy for the Jewish authorities or anyone in Jerusalem to look for Jesus's body.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Second Temple Jews had [a tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossuary#Jewish) of removing the bones from a tomb after the body has decomposed and placing them in an ossuary. As such, the location of bodies was very important to them and unlikely to be forgotten.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2. Con: This underestimates the power of wishful thinking. People make decisions to believe based on leaps of faith. Even when presented with incontrovertible proof that they are incorrect, faithful believers tend to double down and do not deny their faith. See, for example, modern examples of those who predict the end of the world on a particular date.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2.1. Con: While wishful thinking may apply to the Disciples themselves, if the fact that Jesus's body was present in the tomb was advertised \(as the Roman and Jewish authorities would likely do in reaction to a perceived threat such as Christianity\) then they would be unable to amass other followers.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2.2. Con: Many of the supposed eyewitnesses to the resurrected body went on to be martyred for their faith.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2.2.2. Con: Dying for one's belief does not prove a separate phenomenon as fact
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2.2.3. Con: There are [no confirmed](http://freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/A_Silence_That_Screams) "eye-witnesses" to the resurrection of Jesus.  There are no known references in any outside literature confirming those claims.  The only testimony that is known is from scroll fragments that appear to be anywhere from 70-300 years after the supposed time of the event.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2.2.3.1. Con: Scrolls that are confirmed to be from 70 years after is far better than any other written document of antiquity can claim. When you reject that evidence, you may as well reject the existence of any written document besides very few stone tablets and buildings.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2.2.3.2. Con: Some of the scrolls preserve letters of Peter, who claimed to be an eyewhitness of the resurrection and died for his faith.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2.2.4. Pro: There are in fact [confirmed](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76) [witnesses](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110) of the [resurrection](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138) of [Jesus](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11) in [modern](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1) day times and who [died](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/135) with that testimony. The [death](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/17) for a testimony indicates that one is [willing](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1) to give their life for what they [learned](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/bofm/alma/11) which shows the [importance](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3) of the [knowledge](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/bofm/morm/8) even over their own lives and their [eternal](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/bofm/ether/15) [perspective](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/bofm/alma/41) than deny what they [know.](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/bofm/morm/5)
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.2. Con: It's possible that Jesus was not actually buried in a tomb.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.2.1. Con: [The Greek word for "bury"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/θάπτω) used in the early creed found in 1 Corinthians 15:3-7 implies a proper burial in a tomb.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.2.2. Con: [Josephus records](http://lexundria.com/j_bj/4.317/wst) that even victims of crucifixion were given a proper burial according to Jewish law.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.2.3. Con: We have [archaeological evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehohanan) that victims of crucifixion were given a proper burial according to Jewish law.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.2.3.1. Con: The remains of a single victim of crucifixion, out of perhaps tens of thousands of crucifixions throughout the ancient world, cannot establish any sort of pattern or standard practice. From this piece of evidence, we cannot determine whether burial of crucifixion victims was the rule or the exception.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: There is no evidence to indicate how long [Jehohanan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehohanan) was left on the cross before being placed in a tomb. He may have been left to rot for days, as was typical Roman practice. So, these archaeological remains -- a single ankle bone -- provide no evidence that Jesus' body was taken down from the cross and placed in a tomb on the day of his death, in accordance with the timeline suggested by the Gospels.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.2.3.2. Con: The tomb of Jehohanan shows signs that the owning family was aristocratic. Jesus' family would not have had the clout to procure a tomb for him, especially considering he was executed as an enemy of the Roman state, and so the Romans would have been unlikely to comply with requests for a proper burial. Part of the punishment of crucifixion was the humiliation of one's corpse being left to decay on the cross.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.2.4. Con: Jesus's burial meets the [criterion of embarrassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_of_embarrassment), since it admits that the Disciples couldn't afford a tomb for Jesus's body and had to resort to using the tomb of a member of the Sanhedrin, the same group that had called for Jesus's execution.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.3. Pro: The Gospels report that the tomb was discovered empty by Jesus's woman followers, which meets the [criterion of embarrassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_of_embarrassment), since the testimony of women was not considered valid in that time and culture.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.3.1. Pro: The tomb's discovery by women was mocked by Christianity's enemies. Celsus in particular said: "\[A\]fter death he rose again and showed the marks of his punishment and how his hands had been pierced. But who saw this? A hysterical female, as you say..." \(C. Cels. 2.55\)
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.4. Pro: It was claimed by the enemies of Christianity that the Disciples stole Jesus's body, which tacitly admits that the body could not be found.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.4.1. Pro: Justin Martyr records in Chapter 108 of his [Dialogue with Trypho](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-dialoguetrypho.html) that this claim was made.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.4.2. Pro: The [Nazareth Inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazareth_Inscription) is a ruling made in that area not long after Jesus's death, declaring that grave-robbing would be punishable by death. This may have been a response to the supposed theft of Jesus's body.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.4.3. Pro: Matthew 28:13-15 records that this claim was made.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.5. Con: It's possible that the Disciples stole Jesus's body.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.5.1. Con: The tomb containing Jesus's body was located in the wealthy district of one of the largest cities in the ancient world, and the theft reportedly happened near Passover, when Jerusalem would be full of pilgrims. It is unlikely that the Disciples would be able to steal and hide the body without ever being seen.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.5.2. Con: According to [Matthew 27:65-66](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+27%3A65-66), a guard was posted at Jesus's tomb, making it unlikely that the Disciples would be able to steal his body.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.5.2.1. Con: Most modern historians doubt the account of the guard at the tomb.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.5.3. Con: The Christians repeated the claim that the body was stolen, which is unlikely if they actually did so, since they wouldn't want the rumor to spread any further.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.4.3.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.5.4. Con: After Jesus's death, the Disciples were scattered and in fear of persecution, making it unlikely that they'd conspire to commit grave-robbery and potentially add to their troubles if they got caught.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.3.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.6. Con: It's possible that the Disciples and authorities looked for Jesus's body in the wrong tomb.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.7. Con: It's possible that Jesus's body had already decomposed by the time the tomb was checked.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.7.1. Con: No significant decomposition would have occurred if the tomb was checked less than three days after Jesus's death, as the Gospels claim.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.7.2. Con: Even if the tomb was left unopened for long enough that the body decomposed, Jesus's bones would still be present in the tomb.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.7.2.1. Pro: Remains from that time period, and even much earlier, still exist today.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.7.3. Con: There is no evidence that the tomb was left undisturbed for long enough that the body decomposed.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.8. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.9. Con: It is possible that the tomb was a fake, or meant for someone else.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.10. Con: The only supporting evidence for this is the New Testament, which has not been established as a reliable source.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.11. Con: This is highly implausible. Given what we know about Roman punitive practices, Jesus' body would have been left on the cross for a few days to rot and be picked apart by scavenging animals, then tossed into a common grave. As an enemy of the state, the Romans would not have cared to provide him with a proper burial, let alone to cater to provincial Jewish customs.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2.2.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.6. Con: Naturalistic observations show dead people have the tendency of staying dead.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1. Con: Circular argument. The resurrection is given as evidence for a God who can change reality. Therefore the unchangability of reality is no valid argument.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: When a miracle is by our current understanding of the world impossible and illogical, there needs to be a crushing evidence to accept that miracle as real.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: If the existence of God is plausible, and His interference in the world if He exists is plausible, then there is no reason to consider miracles impossible.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Assuming a priori that miracles are impossible is a circular argument, since it assumes God's nonexistence to discount evidence for His existence.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Miracles are not assumed to be impossible, they are known to be impossible as they are in direct contradiction with prescriptive rules about real events.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Assuming a priori that miracles are plausible because God is plausible is a circular argument, since it assumes God's plausibility without any evidence or prescriptive reasoning at all.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Miracles, by their definition, are events that defy the standard natural order and/or laws of physics, and thus should be rejected.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Miracles don't necessarily defy the laws of physics, but are simply an external force contributing to the world. As an analogy, if you have full understanding of physics and all related objects, you can predict the path of a billiards ball when it is shot. However, if I reach in and pick up the ball, that path won't occur. That doesn't mean that I broke the rules of physics, only the rules of billiards.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: As such, miracles count as evidence more for an external force than for an arbitrary cessation of the natural order, and thus evidence for God.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: This external interference is equal in improbability to a cessation of natural order. Therefore it should not be accepted without overwhelming evidence, which does not exist in the cases being discussed.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Picking a billiards ball does not mean you broke the rules of physics because you didn't. However, a miracle that does defy the rules of physics \(for example feeding 5000 people with 5 loaves and 2 fish\) is impossible in this universe.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Interference by an external omnipotent force could account for such miracles by inserting extra matter/energy, in the same way that the energy of someone removing a billiards ball wasn't accounted for originally. Such an act of interference is certainly logically possible.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.2. Con: The natural order and laws of physics are based on experience and observations, and as such any observation that appears to violate them should be investigated and our understanding of the world adjusted to match, rather than simply denying unexpected results as impossible.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.2.1. Con: The current observation is that such a miracle is impossible and, while any miracle claims are being investigated, the matter should be seen in this way.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.2.2. Con: The claim is true, in the sense that this is exactly what happens when we: i\) observe something happening which is supposed not to happen, and ii\) independent sources duplicate and re-affirm the result through experiment or scientifically controlled, i.e. precisely measured, observation. This unfortunately means that all biblical mentions of miracles are, by default, non-scientific, and basically a multi-corroborated hearsay, coming from an non-scientific age with minimal deciphering abilities.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.2.1.3. Con: The claim that there is an external force acting on something does not show that such force is related to the existence of a God.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.2.1.4. Con: Miracles being talked about are the ones that defy the laws of physics.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.2.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.3. Pro: The Bible is no more evidence for the existence of God than Egyptian Hieroglyphs are evidence for Anubis.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.2. Pro: The Bible itself is a collection of multiple sources by different authors. The life of Jesus was narrated by four separate people. As such there are multiple corroborating sources.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.2.1. Con: The gospels partly share same source. They were written by non-witnesses and not in Jesus's language. They were written years later and include impossible acts \(walking on water, etc.\) They are highly unreliable.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.2.2. Con: Number of people involved is not a proof of objectivity.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.2.3. Con: There are several books and authors that talk of Zues, Thor, and countless of other gods, however few people believe they were real.  Books and believers do not make something real.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.2.4. Con: Many notable occurrences referenced in those texts however lack extra-biblical evidence. For example the release of a prisoner by Pilate each passover. The fact that historians of the time who documented so much of Pilate's actions would overlook this and other events brings into question their authenticity.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.2.5. Con: The canonical Gospels may well be corroborative, but they are also collaborative in that much of their material is evidently derived from a source or sources that they shared in common. In some cases, one Gospel appears to have copied one of the other Gospels verbatim. Therefore, these are not independent, disinterested sources; they are interdependent sources written by authors who had a vested interest in making their theological claims more persuasive.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.3. Pro: There are a [number](https://inspiringphilosophy.wordpress.com/2015/08/15/41-facts-confirmed-in-the-new-testament-from-william-paley/) [of](http://truthbomb.blogspot.com/2012/01/84-confirmed-facts-in-last-16-chapters.html) [facts](http://truthbomb.blogspot.com/2012/02/59-confirmed-or-historically-probable.html) mentioned in the New Testament which are corroborated by external sources.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.2.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.3.2. Pro: It is unlikely that a later forger would be this accurate, especially at a time when history, record-keeping, and archeology weren't formalized/readily available.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.3.2.1. Con: Given the assumption that history and record keeping weren't formalized/readily available - how do we know the external sources claimed are valid? If anything this undermines the idea that we should trust the external sources of the time.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.3.2.2. Con: A forger would have access to the popular dogma and previous writings of the day and could easily expand on it.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.3.2.3. Con: Later editors could easily edit out discrepancies as the books are copied, and there is evidence of such editing.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.3.3. Con: That the bible gets some other facts right does not support the claim that it is correct on the existence of God. Most works of fiction borrow elements from history. That does not make their fictional part more true.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.4. Pro: There is copious [internal evidence](https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/gp/gp1_authenticity_stein.pdf?) for the reliability of the Bible.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.4.1. Pro: The Bible contains a number of [undesigned coincidences](https://calumsblog.com/undesigned-coincidences/), which imply that it is reliable.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.4.1.1. Con: A few internal consistencies prove nothing. There is an overwhelmingly greater number of inconsistencies, such as the four gospels not agreeing on basic aspects of the crucifixion.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.4.1.2. Con: To say a coincidence is undesigned requires us to know a lot more about the bible authors and their intentions than we are able to.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.4.2. Con: Internal evidence does not afford proof. As an example, there is copious evidence for the existence of [Spider-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.4.3. Con: The majority of literature containing fictional elements will also contain writing describing the real world too. This helps to allow the reader to immerse themselves in the context and makes the fictional elements more acceptable.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.4.4. Con: There's also unreliable statements like [Matthew 3:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+3%3A2&version=NIV), [Mark 9:1](http://biblehub.com/mark/9-1.htm) and [Luke 9:27](http://biblehub.com/luke/9-27.htm) claiming Jesus would return as ruler \(the Kingdom of God\) within the lifespan of those who lived in Jesus' time.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.4.4.1. Con: This is a misinterpretation of the meaning of the Kingdom of God in these passages.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.5. Con: As the Bible cannot be proven historically accurate, it cannot be used as proof of anything.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.5.1. Con: The documents that make up the Bible are among the most well preserved ancient documents.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.5.1.1. Con: The physical condition of an ancient document does not provide a reliable basis for a reasonable judgement on the reliability of the information contained within.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.5.2. Con: There are less well preserved ancient documents than those that make up the Bible that we use to draw historical conclusions.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.5.3. Con: Civilizations have been discovered, the existence of which were first known about through Biblical stories.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.6. Con: The Bible merely provides evidence that people wrote about a creature called God. Not that he really existed.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.7. Con: Using written stories that were originally [oral tradition](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/origins-written-bible.html) as evidence is the equivalent of 'hearsay' in a court setting. Since the authors of the Bible collected oral tales and pieced them together, it is essentially the same \(or worse, depending on the distance from the original story\) as a second-hand account, which is [not admissible as evidence](http://dictionary.findlaw.com/definition/hearsay-rule.html) due to the unreliability of the claim, except under certain circumstances.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.7.1. Con: Historical evidence is not held to the same standard as legal evidence.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.8. Con: The Quran provides contradictory claims, and there is no reason to prefer one over the other.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.9. Pro: The Bible is a reliable historical document.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.9.1. Pro: The Bible is the most accurately preserved ancient document in existence.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.9.1.1. Con: The bible was assembled by a group of people that voted on a collection of cannons to represent the final result.
It was later adjusted by the King James version by finding commonality between the various version.  Today we still have several version often conflicting with each other.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.9.1.2. Con: There are other well-preserved ancient texts, some of which predate the Bible, for example  the [Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas) and [Puranas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puranas).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.9.1.2.1. Pro: This also applies to the [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran) of Islam and the [Kitáb-i-Aqdas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit%C3%A1b-i-Aqdas) of Bahaaism.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.9.1.3. Pro: It may be the case that the Bible is historically accurate, but that it contains misconceptions and superstitions that were prevelant at the time. These may account for the notable errors and oddities found in it.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.9.1.3.1. Con: A source is either reliable, or it is not. It can not be simultaneously a perfect and accurate historic record we can trust every word of, and have a few flaws here and there. As such, if the bible might have some errors in it, it is not sufficiently accurate to prove the existence of God.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.9.1.3.1.1. Con: Asserting that the Bible is either completely inerrant, or otherwise cannot be trusted at all, is an example of the [nirvana fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy). Given that all humans are fallible, all documents contain some amount of error, and in order to hold all records to the unattainable standard of inerrancy we would be forced to abandon the entire field of history.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.9.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The claims made in the bible are regularly extraordinary, and do not line up with our understanding of the universe without an incredible amount of work. Given the fantastic nature of the work, it seems it's only claim to legitimacy is it's supposed accuracy, when that is undermined it may be possible to show the bible, or parts of it are true, but it does not make sense to presume this.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.9.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Like the bible, the legend of King Arthur reference many historical events with some degree of accuracy. This does not support the existence of green knights who can walk around without their heads.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.9.2. Pro: The Bible is supported by archeological evidence.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.9.2.1. Con: Truths and lies can be in the same document. Accurate historical accounts do not validate unverifiable "testimony of God".
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.10. Con: Religious scriptures can be considered as an equivalent of children stories used as stories for explaining moral compass for the general purpose. But the ancients may have instilled this too much into their kids that they thought it was the way of life.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.3. Con: This is an impertinent statement about the plot of the Bible. Unrelated to the fact or historicity of it's contents. 

In the 1999 film "The Matrix", Neo, the protagonist fulfils a series of prophecies regarding "the one". 

The prophecies and the fulfilment thereof are in the same book. As such, the prophecies at the start, and their fulfilment at the end, put it on the same evidentiary level as any fictional film \(as well as many other [religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_comparative_mythology)\) containing the same idea.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.3.1. Con: The Old Testament and the New Testament were written by a different set of authors.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.3.2. Con: There is good evidence that the [prophecies](http://christinprophecy.org/articles/applying-the-science-of-probability-to-the-scriptures/) regarding the Messiah predated Jesus's life, and as such the connection couldn't have been fabricated.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: The Dead Sea Scrolls contain many of these fulfilled prophecies, and [likely predate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls#Age) Jesus's ministry.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.3.2.2. Con: Most accounts of the life of Jesus are from centuries after his existence, the fabrication is in these accounts of Jesus' life not in the original prophecies.

1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.3.2.2.3. Con: Even conservative New Testament scholars date all of the Gospels to [within a single century of Jesus's death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_the_Bible#Table_IV:_New_Testament).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.3.4. Pro: There is ample [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls) to suggest the canonical Bible was selectively compiled omitting works such as the [gnostic gospels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nag_Hammadi_library) and their "inconvenient" contents.  This created a narrative compatible with the Church of the times.   However even after editing there remain hundreds of contradictions and inconsistencies in a work that is claimed to be the literal word of an infallible god.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.3.2.1.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.5. Con: This number has to be compared to the total number of Old Testament prophecies, and the resulting ratio has to be compared to probability of fulfilling any of these prophecies by chance. There are contradictory prophecies \(the first coefficient\) and vague prophecies \(the second coefficient\).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.6. Con: The new testament also claims fulfillment of prophecies that don't exist.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.6.1. Pro: John 7:37-38 "If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.  He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water" No prophecy like this appears in the old testament.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.6.2. Pro: Matt 2:23 "And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene." 

The words Nazareth and Nazarene don't exist in the OT/TANAKH.  You could easily claim spoken meant verbally, thus making it not verifiable, yet Matthew uses the word spoken other times to refer to written text. \(e.g. matt 4:14-16\)
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.7. Con: At least some of the claimed fulfillments of prophecy are based on questionable understandings of the text. For example Matthew 1:22 generally is considered to refer to Isaiah 7. The story is about Ahaz and an impending war, Isaiah came to give him a sign which was fulfilled in the story about the young woman giving birth to a child named Immanuel. It is illogical that Jesus being born hundreds of years later would be a sign to Ahaz.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.7.1. Pro: Harper's Bible Dictionary concurs \(185 printing, page 419\): "It is clear, however, that... Isaiah 7:14 did not speak of the miraculous birth of Jesus centuries later.... The sign of Immanuel offered by the prophet to Ahaz had to do with the imminent birth of a child, of a mother known to Ahaz and Isaiah, and signified God's presence with his people...."
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.8. Con: Fulfillment of prophecy is a hotly contested matter. For example those who practice Judaism deny Jesus fulfilled prophecy, while Christians believe Jesus fulfilled prophecy from the TANAKH/Old Testament. Mormons believe Jesus then fulfilled more prophecy from the New Testament, which Christians deny.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.9. Con: Messiah is simply one anointed by God. Messiahs are actually common in the TANAKH/Old Testament - for example the term is used with a Jewish king, Jewish priests and prophets, the Jewish Temple and its utensils, unleavened bread, and a non-Jewish king \(Cyrus, King of Persia\).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.10. Con: The Bible has been edited and modified well after Jesus' death in order to fit the narratives of the early church. Verses have been added to the Bible as much as 300 years after Jesus death. [Mark 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_16)
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.3. Pro: Religions that have been present for a longer period of time have tradition on their side, which newer religions lack.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.3.1. Con: Tradition carries no weight in arguments, as something being assumed in the past is not sufficient reason to believe it is true. Neither is the fact that something was done in the past evidence that it is the best option. In fact, history is littered with examples of erroneous traditions.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: It can be true that "something being assumed in the past is not sufficient reason to believe it is true," while at the same time being also true that "tradition carries weight in arguments."

This is because though tradition is not a sufficient reason for belief, it can be an important part of a set of reasons, and often is a necessary condition for belief.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.3.1.1.1. Con: If there are a set of reasons something was believed in the past, the reasons themselves should be presented, instead of the fact that they were believed in the past.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.3.2. Con: Human societies had the tradition of not granting people equal rights, but the West abandoned that practice as being wrong. Thus, something being a tradition is thus not of importance.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.4. Con: The acts committed by adherents to Christianity over time are evidence against them representing God as they include some of the most [murderous](http://www.badnewsaboutchristianity.com/gh5_atrocities.htm), [rapacious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases), [abusive](http://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-24.htm), [oppressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_HIV/AIDS) and unethical institutions the Earth has ever seen.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.5. Con: [Which one?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations) For every commitment one makes to belief one tenet of one form of christianity, one is becoming an atheist with regard to other Christian gods. Unless god can represent different to different people, in which case there's no reason to be Christian in the first place.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.7. Con: Many claims in the Bible are provably false. For example it can easily be proven by geology that there has never been a global flood. This is an observable fact about the earth. Yet the Bible says clearly that there was a global flood. This is just one example of the Bible making claims that are provably untrue.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.7.1. Pro: Genesis is false.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.7.1.1. Pro: God creates Eve after Adam already existed and had even named things, which is contradicted by anthropology and evolution that show that genders existed before humans and that humans evolved male and female along side each other from other species.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.7.2. Pro: The Bible gets simple facts wrong.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.7.2.1. Pro: The mustard seed is not the smallest of all seeds \(as claimed in[Matthew 13:31-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A31-32&version=NIV)\), rather there are many seeds smaller \(orchid seed, poppy seed, ...\).
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.8. Pro: The Scripture \(as well as other fundamental texts about God in other religions\) contains sentences which assert their own provability, also known as Henkin sentences. From[Lob's theorem](http://www-users.math.umd.edu/~laskow/Pubs/713/Lob.pdf) we know that Henkin sentences are true.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.8.1. Con: To be a Henkin sentence, the statement has to assert its own provability in a strong enough and formal enough way. Sentences like 'Verily, verily I say unto you that there exists a proof of my words' are not Henkin sentences.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.8.2. Con: Truthfulness of some sentences in the Scripture does not imply truthfulness of the other sentences in the Scripture.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.8.3. Con: The original argument is about the God of Classical Theism. Invoking any scripture of any particular religion necessarily entails a particular type of theism rather than Classical Theism which makes no claims aside from god being "the supreme metaphysical being". Insofar as I know, scripture either references the Torah, New Testament, or the Quran which all claim omnipotence, omnipresence, or more in their monotheistic conceptions.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.3.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.5. Con: Even if the evidence or source of authority of most religions were questionable, that doesn't affect [classical theism](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Classical_theism), since it isn't a religion but a philosophical view.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.6. Con: As a believer of Atheism, one must believe that his belief or religion is right while all the other contradicting religions and beliefs are wrong. And yet, it lacks any evidence, not even having individual experiences nor ancient texts which some of the other religions can suggest as proof of validity.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.6.1. Pro: A belief in Atheism, unlike weak agnosticism, is a positive belief in the non-existence of a thing. As such, it is a belief about a god similar to how Theists have beliefs about a god.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.6.2. Pro: A belief in a god is a part of a larger world view, rather than an idea that stands on its own. It answers questions about the meaning of existence, the purpose of our actions, the cause of physical phenomenon, and other questions necessary to functioning well as a human. Removing that single belief does not remove the need for the larger system. Such a system would be a religion, whether Atheist or Theist, formalized or unspoken.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.7. Con: Saying that the evidence for different religions is similar because they all use individual experiences and/or texts as evidence is a critique of the type of evidence, not the content. It is similar to saying that because witnesses are called to testify in trial, both the plaintiff and defendant have the same evidence. What remains is to assess an individual religion's evidential claims.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.8. Con: This claim is self-defeating.  Consider this:

"As a believer in this claim, one has to believe they are right while all contradicting claims are wrong. There is no evidence to support such statements."

Truth is, by definition, exclusive. If one claim is true, an infinite number of contradictory claims are necessarily false.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1.9. Con: It is important to differentiate the existence of something \(a God in this case\) and the beliefs of a given doctrine \(in this case, religion\). Religion is in fact only a theoretical approach to the idea of God, but that people may have a wrong idea of something does not mean it does not exist.
1.1.2.1.3.3.2. Con: With a big enough 'God' there need not be consistency. The problem is with the religions rather than with individual people or with 'God'.
1.1.2.1.3.3.3. Con: Religious texts, sects and anecdotal experiences could be likened to the different paths climbing a single mountain. People who start from the north would describe a very different geography while travelling - inconsistencies in narrative - from those starting from the south. The ultimate destination, however, remains the same.
1.1.2.1.3.3.3.1. Con: The basis of most religions is morality, yet many different sects have completely different points of view \(e.g. on abortion, LGBT people\) and different systems \(e.g. in Catholicism the current pope decides the church's views\). The "geography" is an integral part of the journey. Some Catholics believe even non-Catholic Christians are destined for hell.
1.1.2.1.3.3.4. Con: Conflicting claims by a group of people cannot demonstrate that the all of the claims are false. One person's claim may be correct, while all of the others are incorrect.
1.1.2.1.3.3.4.1. Pro: 2+2 has exactly one correct answer, namely 4. It has an infinite number of incorrect answers.
1.1.2.1.3.3.4.2. Con: There would be no material way to differentiate a false description of God from a correct one.
1.1.2.1.3.3.4.3. Con: While this is theoretically correct, in context, there is no evidence other than anecdotal evidence. The only way it could have any bearing on the conversation would be if there were in fact a consensus.
1.1.2.1.3.4. Pro: If there were one true God they would pass down the definitive knowledge of who they were to the exclusion of all others.
1.1.2.1.3.4.1. Con: If there were only one true God, and it was the God of the bible, he has passed down that knowledge of who he is multiple times throughout the scripture.  Jesus Christ was a perfect example of what God was like since it is written that the son and the Father are one.
1.1.2.1.3.4.2. Con: It is not reasonable to claim to know what an all powerful, all knowing entity would do.
1.1.2.1.3.5. Pro: The non-existence of God is consistent with widely accepted views on the deities of dead, or fringe religions. If all other gods are mythological and created by man, then likely all gods are.
1.1.2.1.3.6. Con: Popular consensus is not a necessary nor efficient means of arriving at truth \(e.g. whether a claim conforms with reality\).
1.1.2.1.3.6.1. Con: Popular consensus is the alternative left by a God supposedly communicated using large numbers of witnesses, but does not communicate to individuals that require it.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2. Pro: Disagreements about the definition of something is hardly evidence that something doesn't exist.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.1. Pro: People disagree with what defines life yet no one would argue life does not exist.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.1.1. Con: The phenomenon of life can be observed, measured and experimented with. This is in direct contrast to the concept of God which can be none of the above mentioned. For definition of life, the disagreement is about technicalities, for definition of God, the disagreement is about its very nature and existence. These are hardly analogous.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Life cannot exist. Certain entities, like animals for example can be alive, but life in itself does not exist, or rather, if it does, we may call it God.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.1.2. Con: There is evidence of people who believe life does not exist: [why life does not exist](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/brainwaves/why-life-does-not-really-exist/)
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.6.2.1.1.1.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.2. Con: Some of the definitions are mutually exclusive, so it is not possible for God to exist according to all definitions.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.2.1. Con: It isn't necessary for God to exist according to all definitions.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.2.1.1. Con: If there are multiple definitions and only a small part of them is true \(and we don't know which part\), then the term is ill-defined. This means we cannot use the term 'God' in well-formed sentences, since we don't know what 'God' is.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Neither an entity nor it's definition is affected by our knowledge \(or lack thereof\) of either. Our incomplete knowledge invalidates neither the entity, or the proper definition of the entity.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.2.1.2. Pro: Some "definitions" may simply be wrong or inaccurate.  In such cases, it is the definition, not the object, that should be discarded.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.3. Con: We cannot establish a test for or against a claim without first accepting the definitions.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.3.1. Con: If God exists, then it would only seem logical that God could never be defined for he is Alpha and is Omega therefore he is, but also isn't from a philosophical point of view. It takes a whole lifespan in order for a certain individual to define himself, therefore God is self explanatory because it takes the entirety of creation to explain Himself.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.4. Pro: People disagree on what defines marriage, and yet no-one would deny that it exists.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.3.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.6. Pro: The versions of God are human approximations of a being more vast than the people writing the stories. Since they're human perspectives, contradictions are almost inevitable. For someone reading about it... Put it this way. Imagine a lit candle in the centre of a room, surrounded by a huge number of curved and bent and flat and twisted mirrors. If you had to draw a picture of the candle using only the reflections, it would almost have to be a composite, and dependent on where you were standing.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.7. Pro: The object may seem different to all observers but is fundamentally the same object. This is the nature of truth and perhaps the reason we have so many religions.
1.1.2.1.3.6.3. Pro: There are conflicting views and definitions on Quantum Theory, but still all of them believe the equations to be true.
1.1.2.1.3.7. Con: If all religions shared an identical understanding of God, this would then necessitate that humans could not freely make up their own minds about him.  Without multiple possible choices, freedom does not exist.  Therefore disagreements about the nature of God are only able to be evidence for humanity not understanding him.
1.1.2.1.3.7.1. Pro: The morality of major religions has changed drastically over time, in line with the Zeitgeist and cultural mores of the time. For example slavery was deemed perfectly moral by most religions 600 years ago, eg. by Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism as well and non-theist  ideologies like Buddhism.
1.1.2.1.3.7.1.1. Con: This does not show a change in morality, but a change in man's perception of morality. 

If it was actually morality itself that changed, then slavery was actually moral in the Southern United States in 1840. In fact, many persons recognized that slavery was immoral during the founding of the nation, and fought to limit its practice in the new country.
1.1.2.1.3.7.2. Con: When something actually exists before us, we are not free to choose its characteristics.
1.1.2.1.3.7.2.1. Con: One may take his painting and change the nature of his painting in any way he chooses therefore this argument is invalid
1.1.2.1.3.8. Pro: There exist many different religions and beliefs for which God has different goals, attributes and properties, etc. For example see a [list of Chistian denominations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations) and their different conceptions of God.
1.1.2.1.3.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.
1.1.2.1.3.9. Con: This argument has nothing to do with God - it is a comment on man's autonomy and man's intellect. It is a non-argument in the context of the debate. God's role in this confusion is explained as being of His divine design in response to man's idiocy in [Genesis Ch. 11 v.1 to v.9.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11&version=NIV)
1.1.2.1.3.10. Con: This is not an argument that supports the non-existence of God, but an argument that says "Humans cannot yet see beyond contradictions."
1.1.2.1.3.11. Con: All Religions are branches of the same tree. All are different and contradictory but all of them are fundamentally the same: methods of following God...which is the purpose of all of them. Such as man is different no matter the person, such is the nature of Religions for all humanity, no matter the cultural differences must have a Religion that is fit for them and their understanding, even in the case of fundamentally different people from any and all points points of view.
1.1.2.1.3.12. Pro: -> See discussion #3371: What [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) should people follow?
1.1.2.1.3.13. Pro: Anyone who believes in a religion will only ever follow one single religion,so if out of the tens of thousands different versions of every religion, that each follower solely follows that particular religion,means that religious believers doubt as many religions as an atheist except from one religion. So it’s impossible to determine whether there is any validity to any religion, evidence shows that some have used others to start there own religion, so doubt in any must apply to all without proof
1.1.2.1.3.14. Con: For the purposes of this debate, God has been defined the way [classical theists](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Classical_theism) define God.
1.1.2.1.3.14.1. Con: Classical theists encompass a broad group of religions which do not agree on the definition of God.
1.1.2.1.3.14.1.1. Con: Classical theists do agree on many key aspects of God, even if there are other aspects they disagree about. As such, we are using the widely-agreed-upon [definition](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Classical_theism) for this debate.
1.1.2.1.3.14.1.1.1. Con: Classical theists would say that if God is defined then that God does not exist. See theologians such as AW Tozer, Brennan Manning, etc.
1.1.2.1.3.14.1.2. Pro: Not only do they not agree, the adherents kill each other.
1.1.2.1.3.14.2. Pro: If a debate stipulates a definition, it is entirely irrelevant whether there is disagreement on the definition outside of the debate.
1.1.2.1.3.14.2.1. Con: The disagreement exists within the definition stipulated in the debate.
1.1.2.2. Pro: A transcendent God would naturally be difficult to describe with language, so an inconsistent definition is not a failure but a reasonable attempt to describe a transcendent concept.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: An inconsistent definition does not allow for a rational discussion.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: God's infinite existence can be discussed - even proven - without defining that existence with the kind of precision reserved for humanly-knowable, finite objects. Indeed, any being that can be precisely defined by finite human language is not the truly existing infinite God. And this is no theological or philosophical cop-out. Science runs into the same kinds of problems even when it is dealing with finite objects.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Not having a consistent definition of an object or phenomenon doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, reality exists independently of out concepts and definitions. A better definition may be possible.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: Truth claims that cannot be falsified by evidence, or truth claims that are self-contradictory are false. Thus, an internally inconsistent definition of something does mean that thing does not exist.
1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: I define God as a force that cannot be defined. That being is  conceivable, in spite of not possessing the attribute that you want to imply upon Him. Also, quantum physics discovered that an electron is both a wave and a particle, which are still two opposite concepts, so a workaround had to be introduced.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: Not having a consistent definition of an object or phenomenon prevents claims about its existence from having any impact or meaning.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: First, there is no consistent definition of a spin in quantum physics, but that does not mean that it does not exist. Next, does it mean that if there is a consistent definition, then a defined object must exist. Then I will define a four-legged pink unicorn, etc...
1.1.2.3.2.2. Con: A word has it's meaning before we give it a definition; so neither the absence of a coherent definition nor the difficulty in finding such a definition, strictly entails a term to be meaningless.
1.1.2.3.3. Pro: It is coherent to conjoin logically independent individually coherent properties.
For example, while a square circle is contradictory, it is not incoherent. We know what a square circle is like: It is square, and it is circular. Nothing can be such, but we understand what it would take for something to be such.
Hence, the classical definition of God is not incoherent.
1.1.2.3.3.1. Con: We do not in fact have any notion as to what would be required to make something both square and circular, as one property necessarily excludes the other by definition.
1.1.2.3.3.2. Pro: Some phenomena modeled in Quantum Mechanics are logically inconsistent, yet they still exist. This shows that contradiction of a phenomena has no negative impact to the reality of phenomena.
1.1.2.3.3.2.1. Con: Dual particle nature is not an inherent contradiction, only an apparent one, demanding elaboration of theory not abandoning of it.
1.1.2.3.3.2.1.1. Con: The problem is not with QM theory, but with human mind being unable to cope with the practical results. With QM, physics knocked on the doors of metaphysics. "If someone says 'I understand QM', then that one does not know what QM is." There is an inherent contradiction in human mental abilities. And it did not arise from contradictory concepts, or ideas but due to real life facts.
1.1.2.3.3.2.1.2. Con: Likewise, God contradiction is just apparent one, demanding elaboration of theology.
1.1.2.3.4. Con: Each holy text of the 3 major monotheistic religions gives its own definition of God. If that definition appears to be incoherent or self-contradictory, the problem with suggesting "a better definition may be possible," is that each religion inherently asserts "no better definition than ours is possible."
1.1.2.4. Con: If we cannot reasonably establish a definition of all powerful, all knowing, and all good, we cannot establish that god in the classical sense exists.
1.1.2.4.1. Con: The existence of a concept is not dependent on our ability to define it. At best, this would imply that we cannot know whether God exists, which is not the same as implying that God does not exist.
1.1.2.5. Con: Suggesting something could exist does not support that it does.
1.1.2.5.1. Con: Suggesting that something could exist weakens the arguments claiming it can not exist.
1.1.2.6. Con: An argument for faulty reasoning within Classical Theism actually begins to discredit the resulting theistic claim that a God exists through degrading the reasoning capabilities of those responsible for Classical Theism.
1.1.2.6.1. Con: "Faulty reasoning" is proposed as an "alternate pathway" defeater and is not intended to be taken as fact supported by evidence, but only to show that the claim it counters is not necessarily true.
1.1.2.6.2. Con: Per [wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism), most monotheists agree on three qualities of God: all-knowing, all-capable and completely good. Qualities attributed to god in Classical theism are a superset of these, and considering this superset faulty does by no means discredit \(mono\)theism as a whole.
1.1.3. Pro: The classical definition of God is contradictory in that God is said to be all powerful \(omnipotent\) but also unable to do certain things.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The definition of God is self-contradictory in that he is omniscient but also omnipotent. If God is omniscient, God cannot be omnipotent since God would not be powerful enough to change the known future. If God is omnipotent, God cannot be omniscient because God would be able to change the future and therefore not be certain about knowing it.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: The idea of omniscience and omnipotence are not mutually exclusive, as the knowledge could simultaneously change through action.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: If the actions of a god change its knowledge, it cannot have been omniscient previously.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: God's knowledge is always up to date.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If knowledge needs updating, then it's by definition not all-encompassing.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Knowledge base is ever increasing. In order to know everything, God need to be instantly ever updated. This means omniscience is interactive.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: God is not discovering things at the same rate we are, just like a parent already knows so much more than his newborn child.
1.1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Classical theism does not claim that God's actions changes His knowledge. Rather, He knows the results of all actions before they are done.
1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: The modern term is "interactive". Everything is changing, so actions are always adapting to the changes in environment. In physiology it is called biofeedback.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: God could know the future because He is the one who created it and decided what it will be like \(including the decision to give humans free will\). That decision was possibly made out of time.
1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: If a god creates the future, he automatically negates any chance of free will
1.1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: According to [compatibilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism), free will is possible even if the world is deterministic.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Compatibilism holds that for every individual there exists a hypothetical exhaustive list of preferences and tendencies called their nature, which is not freely determined by the individual \(and thus determined by something external to them\). That individual then wills \(makes decisions\) in a way that predictably follows from their nature and other data, and acts in a way that predictably follows from their will. It's unclear how any change to this formula would make an individual more free.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The ability to contradict or determine one's own nature is what Plantinga calls [maximal autonomy](http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/2013/janfeb/bait-and-switch.html?start=2) - something that is both distinct from free will and, as he argues, logically impossible, since it would require an infinite regress.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Consider the instance when a entity without libertarian free will has weighed two options as equally good, and there is urgency, meaning there is no time for further evaluation, without the ability to make decisions outside of their evaluation, they would freeze, and take the usually worse default action, as we can make these decisions, we know libertarian free will exists.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The lollipop shown [here](http://www.candyconceptsinc.com/assets/images/flower-pop-floor-display-1.png) are all of 4 distinct, types, but otherwise entirely identical, and it's set up so that to get a lollipop, one must choose which lollipop they want, but the display doesn't cause confusion, people don't scan the lollipops for defects until they have ruled out all but one, they just make a decision, and go.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Even when choosing to pick blindly, the individual is choosing according to his nature given the external conditions.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: We can see the ability to make decisions quickly as opposed to rationally that we developed to avoid dangerous indecision in the form of bad decisions, like impulse buys.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: An individual being limited to choose either quickly or rationally is a false dichotomy. Many factors influence a decision \(availability of time, emotions, personal preferences, affordability\) even if the individual isn't concious of them at the moment.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: An individual being limited to choose either quickly or rationally is only a false dichotomy when there is more then a split second to make a decision. Many, many events exist in which this is not the case, and our mind must be able to cope with them.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: In these situations, there is not enough time to even subconsciously evaluate how much time there is to make a decision, but there might be time to review it if it is not a pressing matter.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: The only thing that changes in the decision making process by adding urgency is the given conditions. The individual still chooses according to his nature given the external conditions \(either by taking any of the options or doing nothing\).
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: No mainstream philosopher - compatibilist or incompatibilist, determinist or indeterminist - argues that humans have maximal autonomy.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: The existence of a "nature" as a hypothetical exhaustive list of what an individual will choose is tautological - since any free individual makes choices, there must be a source for those choices. That source, whatever its properties, is what is called their nature.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Importantly, an individual's nature doesn't need to be predictable, unchanging, known by the individual themself or anyone else, or even knowable in order for compatibilism to be valid. It only needs to exist in each moment and be the source of their preferences and tendencies.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.2.2. Con: If every source that could influence choice making is covered under the umbrella of nature, the parts that change one's nature must also fall under this umbrella, this doesn't resolve the problem of free will, it just moves it down from a discussion about the mind to one of nature.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: It's trivial that a hindrance to an individual's ability to act based on their will constitutes a reduction in freedom. If someone decides to do something, but is then restricted from doing so, then they are clearly not free. So being able to act predictably following one's choices is required for free will.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The entire argument of composition, besides semantics they invented to support their point, seems to be that if someone doesn't make a choice they were per-programed to make, they are not free. The ultimate, and certain example of soft-deterministic free will is not man, but the computer it so perfectly manipulate to serve it's needs, yet it is quite obvious that a human is freer then a computer.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.3.2. Con: An unpredictable being is uncontrollable, slight hindrances to the easiest route to a goal are nothing compared to avoiding being turned into a mindless gear in a machine.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: It's unclear how an individual would be freer if their choices didn't predictably follow from their preferences and tendencies \(nature\), combined with their thoughts, judgments, observations, physiological needs and desires, mood, etc.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Any obstruction in the predictability of their choices \(given all the relevant data\) would have to result from some external source \(randomness, demonic possession, etc\), not determined by the individual's will. The interjection of such an external source, though making the individual less predictable, would arguably make them even less free, since it would restrict their ability to choose according to their nature.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Saying that if a person makes a choice, it must be do to an external source, therefore they can't make a choice, therefore making a choice is impossible, is circular reasoning.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Librarian free will isn't librarian free will, in fact, libertarian free will directly contradicts the idea of libertarian free will, because the only possible way it could exist is if it somehow impeded part of the decision making process.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1.2. Con: Under compatablism, the individual is nothing but an equation with the outside world as variable, every action is determined solely by external forces.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1.2.1. Con: In compatibilism the individual's actions are determined by his own \(internal\) nature deciding upon the external conditions given.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Under compatablisum, what that nature is has been predecided. At best, it ignores the past, and calls the present free will.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: this is a violation of the definition of free will, which requires the decision making process to be made at least partly without the influence of past experiences.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1.3. Con: Under the branching model of the universe, every time there is an opportunity for a declension, the individual makes all decisions available to them, each choice making a new universe where the events are carried out, no external force needed.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1.3.1. Con: In each hypothetic universe the same individual would only make one decision according to his nature in that universe. In other alternative universes that same individual's nature would be different and he would act acordingly in each one.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: Until the decision is made, the other universes do not exist. There is only one universe going in, only one 'nature' going in, but many going out.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1.4. Con: The person is the 'external force', they 'posses' themselves.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1.4.1. Con: A person can not act externally over oneself, the closest to that would be a crazy person \(who by its own influence loses control over its own actions\).
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1.4.2. Pro: One example of how it might be that one is external to themselves is [mind-body dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism).
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1.4.2.1. Con: Mind-body dualism doesn't claim that one's will acts externally over one's decision.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1.4.3. Pro: The 'external force' is not an external force, people are capable of libertarian free will.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.2. Con: People's choices do very often follow from their preferences and tendencies, combined with their thought, judgments, observations, physiological needs, desires, mood. etc. but many times that only narrows it down to a set of options from which a choice must be made.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.5. Con: Compatibilism ignores the "make" part of "makes decisions", or 'makes choices', if these things were indeed made, then they did not exist before.
1.1.3.1.2.1.2. Con: Considering God, who is out of time it is not true - such God possibly is not creating future, he has already already created it. He is out of time, therefore in act of creation all of it was made out of bonds of time, but it's possible that God is not choosing what would be, he created some starting point and taken action at only some points.
1.1.3.1.3. Con: There is no known future, since there is nothing to be known.
1.1.3.1.4. Con: This is an attempt to fit an infinite concept into a finite set of restrictions. An omni-being by denotation cannot be limited in any way.
1.1.3.1.5. Con: Knowing the future does not preclude being able to change it. That would only be the case if 'the future' was all powerful/ God.
1.1.3.1.6. Con: According to the [Westminster Confession](https://www.creeds.net/Westminster/c03.htm), God is not bound by what he foreknows in the future, but determines all that comes to pass. Saying that omniscience cancels omnipotence assumes that God does not determine what comes to pass, but that the events of history somehow came about apart from the determination of God. This is an assumption that much of historic Christianity outright rejects, and is therefore a misapplication of how omniscience and omnipotence have been historically understood.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Omnipotence is inherently contradictory. Either an all-powerful being cannot create a stone so heavy that the being cannot lift it, or if such a stone is created it is an object the being isn't powerful enough to lift. In either case the being's power is limited.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Classical theists do not believe that omnipotence was ever meant to include logical impossibilities. There is no thing which God cannot do, and logical contradictions are not truly things but inconsistent bugs in language.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: "A stone that can't be lifted by an omnipotent being" isn't a thing that God can't create because it's not a thing, only a series of words that have been put in a certain order. This only defeats God's omnipotence in the same way as His inability to create a married bachelor.
1.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: [Omnipotence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence) is the quality of having unlimited power, not the ability to do anything. There are some actions which God may be unable to do, but not due to a lack of power - and so they don't contradict His omnipotence.
1.1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: The universe, by virtue of containing all possible actors, can do anything that is possible, knows everything that is knowable, therefore, under this line of reasoning, the universe is God, and since whatever God is is good, that's the last point checked off. Since the universe is not God, something we've assumed must be wrong, omnipotence without agency, or God being morality seem like the most likely candidates.
1.1.3.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: There is no place, other then outside of space and time, that the universe could exist, every where, and when is part of the universe.
1.1.3.2.1.2.2. Con: Power and ability are related, and therefore an unlimited amount of power means an unlimited ability.
1.1.3.2.1.2.3. Con: Quoting from the cited link, "The term omnipotent has been used to connote a number of different positions. These positions include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. A deity is able to do anything that it chooses to do."
1.1.3.2.1.2.4. Con: If God was not able to eliminate some of the suffering that is happening in today's word, because it would be impossible for him to do so, that implies that the suffering must be necessary. Given that some suffering is really unnecessary, this seems illogical in itself.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.1. Pro: An omni-benevolent, omniscient and omnipotent God would never have created a world where [30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage)-[75%](https://www.easybabylife.com/miscarriage-statistics-by-week.html) of all fertilized soul-imbued eggs are being miscarried.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Unbaptized babies might very well not go to [heaven](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2015/november/do-babies-go-to-heaven.html). "The Catholic Catechism says infants might be saved without baptism, but stops short of affirming that all will be—though John Paul II, in his EvangeliumVitae, implies that unborn children would be."
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: The lack of clarity in the positions of one \(of hundreds\) of religions does nothing to disprove the existence of God.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.1.2. Con: Not all classical theists believe that unborn children have souls or can experience pain.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.1.3. Con: Job 33:4, it states: “The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.”, so the soul is not imparted until the first breath.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.1.4. Con: As the giver of life, God has the prerogative to take life at any time in whatever manner he chooses.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.2. Pro: An omni-benevolent, omniscient and omnipotent God would never have created a world where extremely sick babies are being born, just to have them suffer for a couple of hours before dying.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: They did not come to Earth by their own volition, but were made by two adults, so this cannot be attributed to babies' free will.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.2.2. Pro: If God wanted to bring them to heaven, he could have other means than letting them perish on Earth before bringing them to him.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.4.1.1.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.2.4. Con: The vast majority of infant mortality occurs in underdeveloped countries due to poor health care and low resources. In the modern world there is plenty of resources to take care of all of humanity. As such, infant mortality is largely due to negligence by humans, rather than by God.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.2.4.1. Con: An all powerful, all good god would both want and be able to prevent such suffering, no matter the cause.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.2.5. Con: This is an [appeal to emotion](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-emotion). Humans may find it hard to imagine a reason for such an event, but our justifiable horror at such an event does not constitute evidence that God could not, would not, or should not have allowed it to happen.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.3. Pro: An omni-benevolent, omniscient and omnipotent God would never have created a world where children are born into war- and famine-stricken places, just to be raped and die of starvation.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.3.1. Con: In a sense, none of the Abrahamic religions say that that world is the one God created: human evil was a later edit on God's creative work.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.4.2.4.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.4.2.5.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.4. Pro: An omni-benevolent, omniscient and omnipotent God would never have created a world where more than six million Jews had to die in the Holocaust.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.4.1. Con: He would if he felt that mankind should be allowed to have free will.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.4.2.5.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.5. Pro: An omni-benevolent, omniscient and omnipotent God would never have created a world where billions of people never had the chance to follow his religion and ascend to heaven, because they lived in places that had never heard of the Bible.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.5.1. Con: It is entirely possible that he has some other plan that will allow them to learn of it and accept it or not.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.6. Con: We are not in a position to know whether particular sufferings are unnecessary from God's position because our understanding of the vast web of causes and effects of particular sufferings could not reasonably be expected to measure up to an all-knowing God's.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.6.1. Con: If God's morality is beyond our comprehension, even given our imperfect being, we must act on the information that we have, because it is the only information we have, and thus what God wanted us to see. If we see God's morality as subjective, it is God's will that we interpret it as such.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.6.1.1. Con: It is circular reasoning to assume our limited view and reasoning is God's will for our understanding of eternal truth... but our limited view and reasoning is precisely what prevents us from fully understanding eternal truths.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.6.1.1.1. Con: It is tautological to assume we know God's will without basis. This can be remedied either by denying God's existence, or assuming he desires us to know what we do. A third option does not readily present itself, so we should assume what we can deduce.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.7. Con: The idea that the greatest good is the reduction or complete avoidance of suffering is not true. There are greater goods that result from suffering. For example: perseverance and sacrifice.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.7.1. Con: Neither perseverance, nor sacrifice are valuable on their own, they are only valuable as a means to an end. For example, we don't go around killing ourselves to promote the good of sacrifice, nor do we compel other too.
1.1.3.2.1.2.5. Con: It is generally accepted that God sets the rules for the universe. If God sets the rules for what is paradoxical and what is not, then God can change the rules if God is so inclined.
1.1.3.2.1.2.6. Pro: One might consider logically incompatible actions such as creating a round square, or a married bachelor, as not within the grasp of omnipotence, as they by definition cannot exist.
1.1.3.2.1.3. Pro: [Omnipotence](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/omnipotence/) is sometimes defined as "maximal power," which includes the ability to do anything possible, but does not include the ability to do anything impossible or paradoxical.
1.1.3.2.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.4.
1.1.3.2.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.5.
1.1.3.2.1.4. Pro: Logic and order in the universe follow from the logic and order of the Creator. While He might be able to create such a rock by His omnipotence, being consistent, it is unlikely He would.
1.1.3.2.1.4.1. Pro: Not only due to being consistent, logically it may also be due to have an ever-increasing potency. If perfection of God is a dynamic concept, then His potency is not fixed at some point, but is always striving towards infinity. Then it would be possible for Him to create with His maximum, and at the next moment He might as well exceed that maximum.
1.1.3.2.1.4.2. Con: To affirm even the theoretical possibility that God "might" be able to do logical inconsistencies makes the concept of God a contradiction.
1.1.3.2.1.4.2.1. Con: An example of such inconsistency would be considered a "miracle". Generally such are thought to be consistent with the concept of "theistic god".
1.1.3.2.1.4.2.2. Con: It is reasonable to assume an omnipotent God could refashion the laws of nature and logic to suite such a hypothetical. So to suggest that he "might" is not necessarily a contradiction to the notion of God.
1.1.3.2.1.4.2.2.1. Con: Logic cannot be hacked. 2+2 is always 4, some principles must be followed. As far as we know, there is no example when logic goes bananas. Logic may be a limited tool, which cannot grasp the reality in total, but is an accurate one. We must follow this rule in order to have a meaningful debate, unless we are shown how exactly laws of logic can be refashioned in some possible reality and what are the consequences of that intervention, meaning change in any parameter may  be logically compensated.
1.1.3.2.1.5. Pro: God also constrains himself with his own attributes. That is, his love cannot invalidate his justice, his justice invalidate his grace, and his grace invalidate his requirement of righteousness.
1.1.3.2.1.5.1. Con: Justice and Grace and \(arguably\) love are specifically Christian claims on the nature of God that are not necessarily entailed by the classical theist conception of Pure Act that is omniscient, omnipotent, and benevolent.
1.1.3.2.2. Con: The answer to your conundrum is that there is a way for him to do anything, the contradictions exist because we as finite beings cannot grasp the complexities and magnitude of any reality outside of our space-and-time existence.
1.1.3.2.3. Con: This argument can be resolved by noting that God has not created this stone he supposedly could not lift.
1.1.3.2.4. Con: This argument could be resolved by noting that a rock could be in a position where it can not be lifted, like in orbit.
1.1.3.2.4.1. Con: Time and space are relative, so despite the fact that it was in orbit, it could be "lifted" from a relative position.
1.1.3.3. Pro: It is inconsistent for an omnipotent, kind, and perfect God to create a world with sin, and either be unable or unwilling to eliminate it.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: The Christian God [created homosexuality](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/largest-ever-study-into-the-gay-gene-erodes-the-notion-that-sexual-orientation-is-a-choice-9875855.html), and yet simultaneously calls for its [lethal punishment](http://www.evilbible.com/evil-bible-home-page/murder-in-the-bible/).
1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Verses condemning homosexuality are [misinterpreted](http://www.wouldjesusdiscriminate.org/biblical_evidence/leviticus.html) and do not actually call for discrimination.
1.1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: [Leviticus 20:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20%3A13&version=KJV)
13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

Not much to misinterpret there.
1.1.3.3.1.2. Con: It is theoretically possible that homosexuality arose via evolution-linked changes to genetic structure, which could be considered a deviation from God.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1. Con: This still presents a contradiction, as only God would be able to create evolution, or the means of its existence. Either God is not in charge of God's plan, or God is still on the hook for creating people in a way they condemn.
1.1.3.3.1.3. Con: This argument is very narrow, because it follow a very particular idea of what God is. Regardless of whether homosexuality is immoral, relativism allows for one to view it or any other sin in that way and still love homosexuals. Perhaps God is in this way similar to the parent of a criminal, who would continue to love their child even though they have done wrong.
1.1.3.3.1.3.1. Con: In this analogy, the parent forced the child they supposedly love into a life of crime.
1.1.3.3.1.4. Con: If God of a cavemen allowed them to be cannibals, was that an accurate take on God? Is every concept of God authentic? Why would anybody assume that Bible is inerrant or Divinely inspired?
1.1.3.3.1.4.1. Pro: Not every human idea about God is worth considering. If we only can agree about true dogma, a divine revelation, so we can discuss only what God truly said about Himself. Most concepts about God are speculations.
1.1.3.3.1.5. Pro: There is [no evidence](https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2015/jan/08/homosexuality-gay-choice-psychology) that homosexuality, which some consider a sin, represents an expression of free will.
1.1.3.3.1.6. Con: God did not "create" homosexuality. The Christian God [tempts no man to sin](http://biblehub.com/niv/james/1.htm). \(v13-15\) 

Not every desire that men have are holy. LGBTQ persons and allies acknowledge this when saying that it is wrong to abuse people because of their orientation. Yet, some people do so. Even if some people are genetically inclined to do so, that doesn't make it right.

Neither does a genetic predisposition to homosexuality make it less of a sin. God has the prerogative to punish sin.
1.1.3.3.1.7. Con: Not all classical theists believe in the Bible. \(Though, admittedly, many of them do.\) Aristotle, for example, lived before the Bible existed, but is widely considered a classical theist. Thus, specifically Christian claims about hell, sin, and Jesus are outside the scope of this debate.
1.1.3.3.1.7.1. Con: Since the Christian God is a classical theistic god, evidence favoring Christianity constitutes evidence for classical theism.
1.1.3.3.1.7.2. Con: [Aristotle](https://www.biography.com/people/aristotle-9188415) did not predate [Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses#Historicity) and the beginnings of what we know as the Bible.
1.1.3.3.1.8. Con: Romans 3:23: "For ALL have fallen short of the glory of God."

The treatment of homosexuals is not different from everyone else. Scripture clearly depicts that we all deserve a just punishment of death, and yet God still sent Jesus for the sins of the world.
1.1.3.3.1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.7.
1.1.3.3.1.8.2. Con: "Fallen short of" and deserving of death are very different standards. One can fall short of eternal glory without deserving brutal murder.
1.1.3.3.2. Con: God may have created the universe but the Bible indicates that people later might have deviated from God's vision through free will.
1.1.3.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.7.
1.1.3.3.2.2. Pro: Initially, according to the Bible, there was no sin or death in God's creation. When [Satan fell](https://answersingenesis.org/angels-and-demons/satan/what-about-satan-and-the-origin-of-evil/) [\(fuller discussion\)](https://www.amazon.com/Fall-Satan-Bodie-Hodge/dp/0890516065) he tempted Eve to trespass the law of God by eating the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Eve offered this fruit to her husband Adam and he knowingly committed sin. Therefore, sin entered the world and death by sin. God gave man a free will and man brought evil into the world by improperly using that free will.
1.1.3.3.2.3. Con: Nothing in the Bible suggests that the physical nature of humans have been modified from the original design by God. Hence the biological nature of homosexuality, which is backed by a huge scientific consensus, is the will of God.[Diversity in human sexuality \(2015 meta-study by the Academy of Science of South Africa\)](http://www.assaf.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/8-June-Diversity-in-human-sexuality1.pdf)
1.1.3.3.2.3.1. Con: Most studies used as supposed evidence for homosexuality being determined biologically are misused.
1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: Many studies regard a correlation \(sometimes not even statistically significant\) between genetic, environmental or morphological traits as causal of sexual orientation.
1.1.3.3.2.3.1.2. Pro: There is a political agenda in spreading the idea that homosexuality is genetic or that it is solely determined by biological factors.
1.1.3.3.2.3.1.3. Pro: Generalisations or simplifications of the factors influencing sexual orientation and identity are asserted without sufficient evidence.
1.1.3.3.2.4. Con: In Matthew 9:11-12 Jesus [implies within his cultural context](http://www.wouldjesusdiscriminate.org/biblical_evidence/born_gay.html) that some people are born homosexual.
1.1.3.3.2.4.1. Con: This could be due to evil coming into world after it's creation.
1.1.3.3.3. Con: It is not contradictory to punish sin and to have created beings who sin, because the bible gives strong distinction between inclination and action. Many people are born genetically predisposed to alcoholism. Biblically, it's only a sin if you actually engage in the act of getting drunk. Desire to do something against the biblical God's way isn't wrong - the action of doing it is.
1.1.3.3.3.1. Con: This argument say it is perfectly fine to give someone a reason to do something, to urge them to do this, and then kill them for doing it. Offering a child some candy, for giving you a piece of bread, for example, just to turn around and kill them for giving you bread, then to blame them for it, is almost unbelievably evil.
1.1.3.3.3.2. Con: Jesus' sermon on the mount states that internal desires are just as condemning as overt actions.
1.1.3.3.3.2.1. Con: [Temptation is not sin](https://www.gotquestions.org/temptation-sin.html). E.g "\[Jesus\] has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin." [Hebrews 4:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+4%3A15) 

There is a distinction between being tempted to covet, lust, harbor anger, and allowing oneself to dwell and cultivate these things.
1.1.3.3.4. Pro: The definition of God is self-contradictory in that he is all-powerful and all-loving but allows for needless suffering.
1.1.3.3.4.1. Con: Suffering is not inherently needless.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1. Pro: The possibility of evil and pain are the necessary consequences to permitting true free human will under an all powerful and all knowing God.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.1. Con: There are many kinds of pain and suffering that do not facilitate free will. Debilitating genetic diseases that kill children in infancy and are of no fault of the parents or the child yet they still occur.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.2. Con: The possibility of evil cannot be justified by the greater  goodness of free will if free will is itself impossible. Free will depends on the abililty to make a meaningful choice. A choice cannot be both independant of the state of affairs and meaningful.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.2.1. Con: This argument seems to rest on an equivocation in the meaning of the word "free", shifting it from "not externally compelled" to "not externally motivated". Choice is free so long as it is not compelled, and can meaningfully take into account externalities without being compelled. There is no contradiction
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.3. Pro: Many classical religions offer people a choice between a "heaven" and a "hell", implying that God grants free will to his creations. The Adam and Eve story corroborates this by resulting in the pair learning good and evil. God clearly permits evil to happen, even if He Himself is completely good.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.4. Con: Intentonally making creatures capable of evil is in itself an act of evil and means that God is not omnibenevolent.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.4.1. Con: Unfree creatures who always make the "right" decision would not be doing any moral good, any more than an asteroid that hits the Earth and wipes out life would be doing moral evil. So while giving creatures free will does produce some evil, it also allows moral goodness to exist, and thus is justified on the whole.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.4.2. Con: The argument "making creatures with a capacity for evil is evil" is not actually a counterargument to the point that a just God would do so in order to create creatures with a capacity for free will so much as it simply denies the premise that free will is a supervening good making the capacity for evil itself a good because free will is impossible without the capacity to choose evil.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.4.2.1. Con: There are already various things that we cannot do. There is no justification to not make evil part of the things that we cannot do.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.4.2.2. Con: The claim that free will is a supervening good, directly implies in this context that the capacity for evil \(and therefore the existence of evil\) is a supervening good, which is self-contradicting.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.4.2.3. Con: -> See discussion #5685: There is no free will.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.5. Pro: In Genesis, suffering is explained as a failing on Man's part, not on God's.  He created man in the Garden of Eden without sin and asked only that they not partake of the knowledge of good and evil.  They did and as promised, eventually died, the knowledge of which was the first example of human suffering.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.6. Con: If it is so that a world without "free will" cannot be without evil, then it must follow that God created a world wherein this was the case. To assert that God could not possibly have done otherwise is to assert that God is not [omnipotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence). 

As such, this claim actually proves the problem of evil.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7. Con: An all powerful God does not need suffering to achieve any other goal than suffering itself, if he does then he is not all powerful.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.1. Con: That God might not need to use suffering to achieve his goals is not sufficient to defeat the parent claim.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.1.1. Pro: God may have chosen suffering in lieu of some other method of achieving the same goal that would actually be worse than the suffering that He permits.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.1.2. Pro: It is possible that God only permits suffering as necessary to achieve the greatest amount of good.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.1.2.1. Con: Thinking that God, a benevolent deity, has a plan is simply a coping mechanism, or a narrative to explain an incongruity in the light of seemingly meaningless suffering.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.1.2.1.1. Con: Without God, all suffering is meaningless.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: In an atheistic universe, there is no ultimate meaning. Any meaning we manage to create by definition arises from beings with no purpose, and is completely illusory.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: In an atheistic universe, in 200 years, the fate of the one who suffers, and the one who inflicts suffering is exactly the same. Both will be dead and consigned to oblivion forever.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: Our experience and evidence indicate that meaning cannot arise from meaninglessness, order cannot arise from chaos, nor can design arise from purposelessness. In an atheistic reality where there is no ultimate meaning, order, or purpose, this must happen for meaning, order, and design to exist.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.1.2.1.1.4. Con: One has the ability to not believe in any god, and still find [meaning, or a greater cause](https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/logotherapy) in their suffering.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.1.2.1.1.4.1. Con: The grandparent claim does not address, nor does it depend on one's belief in God, but in the actual existence of God, regardless of one's belief in Him, or lack thereof.
1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.2. Con: The conclusion reached in the claim is a non sequitur. Even if God requires suffering to achieve His goals, it does not follow that he is not omnipotent in the classic sense.
1.1.3.3.4.1.2. Pro: Pain and suffering are far more effective as motivators and teaching tools than many alternatives, and so are necessary for salvation.
1.1.3.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: It's very likely that in a world without pain, where all creatures are content at all times, there would be absolutely no motivation to change and grow. As such, creatures need to be motivated to avoid pain and pursue happiness.
1.1.3.3.4.1.2.1.1. Con: A world without pain does not at all imply a world without motivation. Humans are often motivated to learn about things that they find interesting or enjoyable, without any threats or pressure.
1.1.3.3.4.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.
1.1.3.3.4.1.3. Pro: Suffering may be inextricably tied to far greater good things, the loss of which would not be worth the abolition of suffering.
1.1.3.3.4.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.1.
1.1.3.3.4.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.
1.1.3.3.4.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.
1.1.3.3.4.1.5. Pro: Being all powerful, all knowing, with an eternal perspective, God may have determined that finite suffering \(however intense\) has eternal benefit. God calls us to trust him. \(See [Romans 8:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A28&version=NIV); [Psalm 66:10-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+66%3A10-12&version=NIV)\)
1.1.3.3.4.1.5.1. Con: The god of the Bible is not perfectly good and therefore does not meet the definition set forth by this debate.
1.1.3.3.4.1.5.1.1. Pro: According to [Judges 20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=judges+20&version=NIV), God commits genocide against the Benjaminites.
1.1.3.3.4.1.5.1.1.1. Con: This is either a deliberate and gross misrepresentation or completely ignorant account of God’s actions as they relate to Israel’s first civil war.
1.1.3.3.4.1.5.1.2. Con: The God of the Bible is attributed the property of goodness \(Psalm 34:8, Mark 10:18. Acts 14:17, James 1:17\).
1.1.3.3.4.1.5.2. Con: An all powerful God ought to be able to create good without suffering.
1.1.3.3.4.1.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.
1.1.3.3.4.1.5.2.2. Con: Of course God could have created a good world without suffering. However, to think that a world without suffering is the best possible world that God could have created given His purposes is an assumption. This cannot possibly be known without omniscience. The burden of proof is too high.
1.1.3.3.4.1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.
1.1.3.3.4.1.5.4. Con: [The bible is often incorrect](https://www.kialo.com/argument/2629.5824).
1.1.3.3.4.1.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.7.
1.1.3.3.4.1.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.7.
1.1.3.3.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.3.
1.1.3.3.4.3. Con: That suffering exists is not part of the definition of God, and thus it cannot be applied to whether the definition is internally consistent.
1.1.3.3.4.3.1. Con: Providing that suffering is bad, we could conclude, that allowing for suffering God created world which is not perfect; and while he is, he should have done a perfect one.
1.1.3.3.4.4. Pro: The [problem of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil) implies that God does not exist.
1.1.3.3.4.4.1. Con: If God is obliged to maximize the total surplus of goodness over bad, then God might be obliged to realize every possible world or state in which there is more good than bad, which includes worlds with a considerable amount of evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.1.1. Con: God could make duplicates of the best world or state without causing as much suffering.
1.1.3.3.4.4.1.2. Con: Being omnibenevolent \(or all-good\) is not equivalent to 'being obliged to maximize the total surplus of goodness over bad'. 
The problem of evil is an argument against an all-good god.
1.1.3.3.4.4.2. Pro: The [Inductive Problem of Evil](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/#IndVerArgEvi) makes it likely that God does not exist.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3. Con: Evil is a privation of Good, and does not exist in its own right. Thus God does not co-exist with evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.1. Pro: Cold is considered contrary to heat, yet cold does not exist in its own right, it is merely a privation of heat. Thus, that two concepts can be contrary says nothing about one being a privation of the other.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.2. Con: If evil can be defined as privation of good, then good can also be defined as privation of evil. We must either accept that both good and evil co-exist, or that neither exists.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.2.1. Pro: If good is defined as the level to which one resists and overcomes evil, then evil must be present to be resisted. "Good" cannot exist without "evil" any more than "hot" can exist without "cold". These are comparative concepts in nature, and thus require opposition to necessitate their existence.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.3.1.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.2.2. Con: This argument relies on a mis-understanding of the above argument.  It looks as good and evil as a subjective measure whereas this line of reasoning relies on it as an objective truth.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.2.3. Con: To borrow an analogy from [Dr. Frank Turek](http://www.crossexamined.org), if you take all of the rust out of the car, you have a better car; if you take all of the car out of the rust, you have nothing!

Goodness can exist without evil, but evil cannot exist without goodness.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.3. Con: Darkness is a privation. But according to Genesis, God said "Let there be light", and there was light.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.4. Con: To say something is a privation therefore it does not exist is non-sequitur. Unless one is asserting that it is a property of privations that they "do not exist".
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5. Con: Whether one calls it "co-existence" or simply permitting evil to exist, the contradiction within the problem of evil is that an omniscient, omnipotent and all-loving being, would not ALLOW the conditions for the sorts of suffering described in [The Problem of Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil).
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1. Con: If, as Christianity teaches, freedom of will actually exists, then God cannot override one's free will to force them not to rob, rape, or murder. Suffering therefore is not God's fault, but the fault of those who choose to walk away from His precepts.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.1. Pro: Mankind without freedom of will is incapable of love. A society of these robots could never do anything of moral significance for good or ill.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.2. Pro: The concept of "goodness" is unintelligible without evil. Evil \(technically, the deprivation of good\) must have at a minimum, the potential to exist for goodness to be meaningful.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.2.1. Con: The concept of "goodness" does not have to be intelligible in order for people to have the best possible life.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.3. Con: Being god all powerful, he could in fact abolish free will.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.3.1. Con: One can be overpowered and forced into compliance--this is called slavery, and we rightfully condemn the master for violating the rights of the slave.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.3.1.1. Con: If like in the bible slavery is not immoral and is within the right of a master, then no rights would be violated.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.3.1.2. Con: There would be need to overpower, just the cessation of free will would be enough.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.3.2. Con: The ability of humanity to do evil cannot be removed without also removing man's capacity to do good. True Goodness requires a choice. 

If the net amount of good in the world is actually greater than the net amount of evil, then God would be evil to remove mankind's capacity for evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.4. Con: Being God good he would want to impede the freedom to harm.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.5. Con: When an action infringes upon someone's free will, that person's free will is already compromised. Therefore, without free will being jeopardized any more than without His interference, the outcome of the situation could be improved by God's action.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.5.1. Con: The identities of the actors here are important.

God grants free will to both the aggressor \(A\), and the victim \(V\). It is not clear what would obligate God to revoke A's freedom because A intends to use that freedom to violate V's freedom.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.5.2. Con: This claim is subjective; it assumes that one has infinite knowledge to understand when divine intervention is objectively necessary.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.5.2.1. Con: Infinite knowledge is not necessary to understand when suffering could be avoided by an omnipotent and omniscient being - it takes at least some basic empathy, and at most: knowledge of the direct outcomes.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.5.2.1.1. Con: Most people would assume that the death of a child would be "unnecessary suffering". However, had that child's name been Adolf Hitler, his premature death might have saved the planet much more "unnecessary" heartache. Humans do not have sufficient knowledge to understand what changes small events will make over time.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.5.2.1.2. Con: We do not know whether God is working even now to minimize suffering in the world. The loss of one's child might seem an unbearable pain; however, the survival of that child might have indirect outcomes that would cause far greater evil to materialize.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.5.3. Con: God often chooses not to rescue, which would require interfering directly with a sinner's free will, but to redeem.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.5.3.1. Pro: God did not intervene in perhaps the greatest sin of all, the fall of Adam that brought every other sin into the world, but rather chose to send Jesus into the world as a sacrifice to redeem mankind to himself. This permits man to choose--freely--whether he wants to be redeemed, or to continue in his rebellion.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.6. Con: Our will is deterministic, therefore God can determine outcomes without infringing on any freedom of will.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.1.4.2.3.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.7. Pro: For God to be "good" he must, if free will is a "good", allow other beings to take actions that are not "good".  He can still be good and all powerful if he ultimately works towards a good end even if he allows non-good behaviour..
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.2. Pro: His creation subjects great suffering onto other aspects of his creation. Sometimes it's their [sole means of survival.](http://geekinthegambia.blogspot.com/2009/04/attenboroughs-eye-worm.html)
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.2.1. Con: Fiction writers are not considered evil for creating misery for their fictional characters to deliver experiences to the existent readers. Therefore, God would also not be evil for creating misery for his existent creatures to deliver experiences to his own transcendent perception.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.2.1.1. Con: God's \(if he existed\) creations aren't fictional, they/we actually exist.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.3. Con: Good parents often allow their children to experience limited suffering, knowing that a greater good will result. No child likes the pain of an immunization, or of a cancer surgery. However, these pains are permitted... even encouraged.... by benevolent parents in the hope of a greater good.

How much more so would an omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent God allow us to experience pain, intending to bring us a greater good through our suffering!
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.4. Con: Suffering is not evil. Suffering may sometimes be the result of evil, but is not a synonym for evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.4.1. Pro: Pain may be the result of love. 

When a parent scolds or disciplines a small child for running out into the road, the small amount of pain felt by the child is intended to prevent the larger pain of being ran over by a speeding car.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.4.2. Pro: Some pain provides a valuable feedback mechanism that we're doing something destructive, or that something has gone wrong in our bodies, and we need to seek medical attention.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.1.2.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.6. Con: Neither are good nor evil ontological categories. Neither exist on it's own. Both are consequences of discrimination, which borrows it's ontology from the observer.
1.1.3.3.4.4.3.6.1. Pro: If good and evil are derived from the ontology of the observer, an omnibenevolent god does not have a fundamental existence.
1.1.3.3.4.4.4. Pro: Needless suffering and evil exists in the world.
1.1.3.3.4.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.4.3.
1.1.3.3.4.4.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.4.2.
1.1.3.3.4.4.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.4.5.
1.1.3.3.4.4.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.4.1.
1.1.3.3.4.4.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.4.4.
1.1.3.3.4.4.4.6. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.3.
1.1.3.3.4.4.4.7. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5. Pro: There is no way an omnipotent all-loving god could co-exist with evil. The two are mutually exclusive by definition. Evil does not merely "imply" that God does not exist, it disproves his existence entirely.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.1. Pro: A solution would be the existence of an all-knowing, all-powerful but evil god; this strongly violates [classical theism's assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism).
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.1.1. Con: An evil god does not solve the problem of evil, because it is just as strongly disproved by the existence of good in the world as a good god is disproved by the existence of evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.3.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.1.3. Con: That is incorrect. It could also be that God has other purposes that we do not understand that are served by giving men free will, even if they use it horribly.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.1.3.1. Con: Any such purpose would imply that God either can't do away with evil or does not want to, which circles back to [the initial claim in this respect](https://www.kialo.com/the-existence-of-god-does-god-exist-2629/2629.0=2629.1-2629.4473+2629.3+2629.288).
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.1.4. Con: The "evil god" hypothesis assumes the existence of a higher standard of morality, and thereby recognizes that this so-called "god" is a pretender to the throne of the God whose nature and character is the very source of morality.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.1.5. Con: The "evil god" hypothesis imports our own definition of good and evil into that reality and does not evaluate the reality forged by that god on its own terms.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.1.5.1. Pro: By recognizing a standard of good and evil that supervenes even on other possible worlds, this claim acknowledges that good and evil are necessary objects. This provides evidence that God necessarily exists in our world and all possible worlds, and the standard of goodness set by his character exists in all possible worlds.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.3.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.3. Con: There is a way and it is called a free will. Free will is not a valid argument against the classical problem of theodicy, since nobody will wish an evil to himself. But in dharmic religions there is a concept of karma, which means that reactions to our actions are delayed. The purpose is to educate us about what is good and evil, by a personal experience of what is favorable and what is not. Karma explains why is there evil alongside with loving God.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.3.1. Con: There are many forms of suffering that cannot be attributed to karma. Terrible things happen to even the most innocent and good people.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.3.2. Con: If the purpose of suffering is to educate us then an omnipotent God could have just created us with that education in the first place, thereby avoiding the need for anyone to suffer.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.3.3. Con: Dharmic religions also have the concept of "Brahman"... the ultimate reality in the universe. According to Chandogya Upanishad 3.14.1, "This whole universe is Brahman. In tranquility, let one worship It, as Tajjalan \(that from which he came forth, as that into which he will be dissolved, as that in which he breathes\)."

If all is Brahman, evil and good are essentially identical. Karma cannot explain how to differentiate between two identical things.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.3.4. Con: According to the doctrine of Karma, all evil that happens to us is brought upon us by our own past evils.

This cannot describe how the first evil was done to us, before we had performed an evil deed. It requires an infinite regress of past lives, or a non-karmic evil to start the chain of karma, which denies the premise that all evil is the result of past evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.3.5. Con: Free will does not justify the ability to execute the will to cause harm, just like free will does not grant the ability to fly \(unaided\) to those who want to fly.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.4. Con: There is no reason they are mutually exclusive.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.4.1. Con: A good and able God would both want and be able to stop evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5. Con: The concept of evil could not exist without a moral standard. The existence of God creates a moral standard to define good and evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1. Con: The mere existence of God doesn't create a moral standard of good and evil. It would be God's words and actions that would define good and evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1. Con: It's possible that, through His nature, God embodies, rather than commands, what is right. In this view, God and morality are the same thing.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: If moral judgments have objective truth, there must exist an objective standard or anchor point to justify them. Such a morally perfect, objective, rational, and transcendent anchor would be considered God.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: The discipline of ethics shows that morality is considered a rational pursuit, that is that it requires reason to reach certain ethical conclusions. As such, any embodiment of the moral standard must also be rational.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Morality does not require embodiment, it just requires minds capable of reason to idealize those moral principles - thus it requires humans, not God.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Humans often idealize behaviors, situations and objects and those idealizations don't need to \(and perhaps never actually do\) correspond to reality.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The idea of a line does not correspond to anything real, it is an idealization based of real characteristics which are not a \[perfect\] embodiment of the concept of line.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: An abstract line doesn't measure anything. It has no dimension of width or height. It's length is infinite, so it is rather useless as a standard of measurement.

A meter stick on the other hand is useful precisely because it idealizes a standard for measurement.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Morality is not a list of rules, but a standard of behavior. Any standard is something by which another thing is measured, and must idealize the quality which it measures. Therefore, the moral standard must idealize the quality of behavior, which implies a person.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: You cannot measure the length of a line using color; rather, the standard used must have length. "24 blue" is meaningless with regard to the length of a line. "24 inches" is meaningful because the standard idealizes the quality of length.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: A standard is not subject to being measured in terms of the quality that it idealizes. In other words, it is illogical to say a meter is not a meter. It must be a meter by definiton.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Rationality itself is a sufficient source.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Without values, rationality only deals with what is, whereas morality is concerned with what ought to be/what we ought to do. [It isn't possible to derive "ought"s solely from "is"s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is–ought_problem).
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Economics, as an example, derives what ought to be from what is valuable, and possible.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Economics relies on a presupposition of value \(i.e. that property is valuable\). The field itself is concerned only with how best to obtain what is already considered to be valuable, but doesn't compel anyone to give personal value to property.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Some people - such as hermits and communists - don't consider property valuable nearly as much as others.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: All people consider property valuable, even hermits, and communists. Those groups just treat possession differently.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Economics only requires that each individual actor values something, not necessarily that they want the same things, or value them the same.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: This is still a presupposition of value, so economics fails to produce "ought"s with no presupposed "ought"s.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Value to the individual is objective, they have a need, and the thing they want can sait it, so this is an is, not an ought.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: [Natural law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law), is a body of philosophical thought that derives ought \(at least partially\) from is.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Secular conceptions of natural law still rely on axiomatic "ought"s - for instance, that one ought not infringe upon another's rights.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: All ethics is concerned partially with what is, using "is"s to supplement "ought"s and create more specific or complex "ought"s. However, no ethical system can successfully reach "ought"s without at least one axiomatic "ought" as its basis.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.3. Con: Natural law is a system that has done great harm to the world, by hindering the rights of women, trans individuals, and homosexuals, repeatedly come up with false conclusions, like that women should have no autonomy, and homosexuals are evil, and that is based on a false interpretation of reality, that things were created with a purpose instead of evolving to adapt to the world. It is by every measure a failed moral system. As such, it has not derived real 'oughts'.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.3. Con: Morality was observed before it was studied, those observations are the 'is's upon which we built our systems.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: In order for morality to be observed it must first exist. If morality exists, then the moral arguments hold true.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: The existence of morality is only one of the assumptions needed for the moral arguments to prove the existence of God.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.3.2. Con: Morality being built upon prior observations of morality is circular - it attempts to ground morality in itself.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: It was seen, then it was studied, once we saw it, we moved to figure out why it was, and how it worked, the observations are the starting point of moral studies, but not the bases of it.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.3.3. Con: Observations of what humans think is moral do not indicate that those humans are correct. The fact that I think it is good to exercise does not prove that it is good to exercise.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.3.3.1. Con: If morality was not observable, we would not know that it exists.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.3.3.2. Con: That morality exists, and that morality should be followed are two different statements.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.3.3.2.1. Con: Definitionally, morality is the means to determine what one should do. The statement "one should follow morality" is equivalent to "one should do what one should do," which is tautologically true.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: [morality: a doctrine or system of moral conduct](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/morality)
[moral: sanctioned by or operative on one's conscience or ethical judgment](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moral)
neither of these definitions disallow someone from acting upon another measure of what they should do, like their
[self interest](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/self-interest), or says that doing one is preferable to the other.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.3.4. Con: If morality is based solely upon an observation of what humans think is moral, then moral progress would be impossible, because it would never be possible to be more moral than what is currently thought to be moral.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.3.4.1. Con: We started with what we saw of morality, and built upon it, just as we did with science, learning it's in's and outs, and applying them to the world around us.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.4. Con: we have to use rationality to determine what values deserve to be valued.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.5. Con: Selection \(via survival\) favors a kind of morality that indicates as prescriptive certain norms and values: a moral framework which exists independently of any deities and independently of whether survival is right or not outside of said framework.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3. Con: If God is morality, then God can not choose what they do, as they must always do what is moral, and thus lacks libertarian free will, and is merely a force of the universe. As such, God would not be omnipotent, as they could not choose.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Since God under this definition would be just a force, we could manipulate, and control them, as we do other forces, which would ultimately make us more powerful then God. If we can be more powerful then God, God can not be Omnipotent.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: We don't manipulate or control other forces. For instance, we can only predict and work around gravity and electromagnetism, not change them - this kind of utilization certainly doesn't imply that we are more powerful than these forces.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: We can defy gravity, or harness it for our own ends, gravity in turn can only gravitate. We are thus the stronger.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Not all things that lack libertarian free will are "just a force".
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Even if He lacked libertarian free will, God could still think and act \(even if those thoughts and actions are determined\), making Him a conscious agent and thus greater than a force.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: If those thoughts and actions are all predetermined, then God would still be nothing more then an animal, or a machine.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.2.2. Con: Not all things that lack libertarian free will are forces, some are objects, animals, or machines, but as morality is an ever-present entity that acts upon us, it, and thus, under this definition, God, must be a force.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.3. Con: In order to utilize God in a way similar to electromagnetism He would have to be completely predictable in His actions. Lacking libertarian free will doesn't mean that something is completely predictable.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Basic quantum events are fundamentally unpredictable, but don't have "free will" in any meaningful sense.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.3.2. Pro: Since God is outside the universe and, at least to some extent, unknowable, it would be impossible to predict His actions even if He was unfree.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.3.3. Con: God in this instance is definite by the rules of an absolute morality, which is by it's nature perfectly predictable if you know the rules.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.3.3.1. Pro: It is do in no small part to morality that out civilization has grown so expansive, so if God is morality, then we are already using God to our ends.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.3.4. Con: A force doesn't have to be perfectly understood to be utilized, we were using compasses many years before we discovered electromagnetism.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2. Con: According to [compatibilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism), an individual will freely choose according to his nature. Therefore, given the same situation and the same individual, the same free choice will be made in all cases.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Compatibility would argue that a rock has free will, as it is not put under distress to make a choice, and that clocks choose what time they tell. Rocks do not have free will, and clocks do not make choices.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Free will is a quality only found in minds.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: By either definition of free will, it is conceivable that it would cover true artificial intelligence if such a thing would be developed, as an AI is not a mind in the traditional sense, a mind is not a necessary condition of free will.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: If such AI should be developed with all of a mind's faculties and fully independent it could be argued that it has a mind in the "traditional" sense.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It could be argued that an AI is just an over-complicated clock. Where the mind necessary for soft deterministic  free will begins is still a valid question.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: No such AI has been developed yet. Until then, it is not safe to affirm that AI's can have a mind.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: We can conceptualize such an AI, which is sufficient to judge whether or not they would be able to have free will.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: If it is conceivable, you should be able to conceive of it.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: In order to be able to make a choice, one must have certain qualities \(such as consciousness, perception, thinking, judgement\) essential to a mind.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.2. Con: Compatibilism exists as a response to incompatibility, and answers the dilemma posed to them by changing the definitions of choice and free will.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.3. Con: As Ted Honderich explained, the mistake of the compatibilistic definition of free will is to assert that nothing changes as a consequence of determinism, when clearly we have lost the life-hope of origination.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.4. Pro: Harry Frankfurt has shown that [alternate possible choices are not required for free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_cases).
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.4.1. Pro: Consider additionally a rock climber high up a cliff face whose harness breaks and whose footholds crumble. The climber is left hanging on by one hand, and with only one other handhold within reach - this limits the climber to either grabbing the other handhold, or plummeting to her death. She will definitely not choose to die, so she only has one possible choice - however, we don't say that she doesn't in that moment have free will. Therefore, many choices are not necessary for free will.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.4.1.1. Con: A rock climber with a broken harness at risk of falling to her death may appear to have no option but to climb up, but she has at least 3, let go, do nothing, or climb up, and internally, a myriad or options to choose as a motive for her choice. One of the 3 courses of action is clearly more preferential, at least from the information we have, but her choice is not certain, and her motives are not locked, what motive she chooses now will probably effect her in the future.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: Say, for example, she thinks of the face of one of her loved ones to find the strength to pull herself to safety,it is quite likely that after she recovers from this event, she will seek out that person, and bond with them as a result, of this occurrence, had she picked a different loved one, she would have instead been more likely to bond with the other loved one.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: Consider she thought of some goal in her life she wanted to accomplish, and used that to will herself to safety, she would probably, as a result, be more committed to that goal.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.4.1.1.3. Pro: Say she thought of how her passing would effect others, under this scenario, she would be likely to be more careful in the future, perhaps to a fault.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.4.1.1.4. Pro: Consider the scenario where she personified the cliff, and saw this as the cliff challenging her, defying her to conquer it, if she took this as a motive, she would likely feel more accomplished for her triumph, and push to tackle greater challenges in the future.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.4.2. Con: The Harry Frankfurt argument does not move to show that alternate possible choices are not required for free will, but instead argues that responsibility is not dependent upon choice. ["The best definition, by his reckoning, is this: "\[A\] person is not morally responsible for what he has done if he did it only because he could not have done otherwise.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_cases)
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.6. Pro: [Free will](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will) is the ability to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.6.1. Pro: The definition of free will doesn't include the need for different outcomes for the same individual in the same situation.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.6.2. Con: This view of  soft determinists, as coined by William James is nothing but an effort to create a quagmire of evasion by stealing the name freedom to mask it's underlying determinism. As Immanuel Kant pointed out, it is nothing more then wretched subterfuge, and jugglery. It is nothing more then attempting to treat the disease by masking, not treating, masking, the symptom.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.6.2.1. Con: Determinism isn't "underlying" in compatibilism, it is both admited and thought to be compatible with free will the way it has been defined.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.6.2.1.1. Con: The way it has been defined by compatablists, which is the way nobody else defines it. Pop-Culture is littered with examples of people exploring the concept of libertarian free will, or as they call it, free will, and how it conflicts with determinism, but nobody but compatablists uses the definition compatablitisest use.`
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3. Con: If God's nature is identical to morality, then God is not compelled by anything, since morality is simply defined as "what God would do." Under this definition, the statement is "God must always do what God would do," which isn't a compulsion, only a tautology.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.1. Con: If whatever God does is arbitrary defined as good, then morality is arbitrary, and no more valid then what any random individual does as the bases of what should be done.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2. Pro: An inability to contradict His own nature does not count against God's omnipotence.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.2. Pro: Freedom to defy one's nature is logically impossible, because an agent's decisions are necessarily the result of its nature. An agent couldn't decide to defy their nature, because that decision would itself be following its nature.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.2.1. Con: All observed creatures with free will \(humans\) have dual natures, which at least in part contradict each other, and can not universally be followed in all instances. For example, one's economic self interest, against moral behavior.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.2.1.1. Con: The conflict between desire for wealth and desire to behave morally is an example of contradicting desires, not contradicting natures. One's nature is what allows one to choose between conflicting desires.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con: The same individual in the same situation may very well make different choices, all factors equal.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Different choices being made in the same scenario doesn't demonstrate that a free agent contradicting their own nature is possible.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.2.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: A person's nature isn't any of their desires, in the same way that a sheet of piano music isn't any of the keys on the piano. Instead, the nature is how someone chooses between their desires - and without it, no such choice could be made.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.2.2. Pro: According to [Arthur Schopenhauer](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer), "Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills."
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.2.2.1. Con: People do consciously change their nature, alcoholics work hard to recover from their addiction, and so can racists, it's not easy, but it can be done.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.2.2.1.1. Con: People can consciously change their thoughts and desires, but they cannot change their nature consciously. Their nature is what allows them to make the decision to change their thoughts/desires.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.3. Con: God under this definition loses not only the ability to defy his nature, but the ability to determine it.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.3.1. Con: In order to change one's nature, one would have to defy one's nature first. The change would, by definition, oppose the agent's nature.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1. Con: If changing one's nature is defying it, then libertarian free will exists, as being able to defy one's nature must be possible, as people do change their nature as they grow.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1.1. Con: People's nature may change, but this change is not due to a conscious decision to change their nature.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: A change must be internal, or external. The change here is clearly not external, so it must be internal. Since the change is internal, the nature changed itself. It has previously been assumed that a nature could not change itself, and that to do so it would have to defy itself. Since the nature would, under these assumptions, defy itself, free will must exist.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.3.2. Con: God's nature is determined by necessity. He must be the way He is, otherwise He would not be God, leaving no room for modification.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.3.2.1. Con: If God's nature is determined by necessity, an act that does not allow them to be omnipotent, then God, as defined in this discussion, can not exist.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4. Pro: Free will only implies the freedom for one to act based on one's nature, not the freedom to defy one's nature. If perfect morality is a part of God's nature, it isn't necessary or expected that He be able to defy it.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4.1. Con: Freedom, the legal interpretation of free will, has long been referred to as the ability to make one's own mistakes.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4.1.1. Con: The legal interpretation of free will is irrelevant.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4.1.1.1. Con: the legal definition is tied to the actual definition, what one says tells us a lot about what the other says.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4.2. Con: Following commands is not free will, one's nature is a form of command, therefore, if one is only capable of following their nature, they do not have free will.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4.2.1. Con: Free will is only contradicted when one is constrained by commands external to oneself. One's nature is internal to oneself, and so following it doesn't contradict free will.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: My brain commands my fingers to move to type this sentence. I wouldn't be more free if my fingers didn't follow that command - in fact, I'd be less free, since I wouldn't be able to act upon my will.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4.2.1.1.1. Con: If one's finger acted independent of oneself, they would be less free, but their finger would be more free, the part is not the whole, and the whole is not the part.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4.2.1.2. Con: A computer holds many commands within itself, and acts upon the majority of them without external stimulation of any kind, but a computer does not have free will. As such, even internal commands are not sufficient to define free will.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4.3. Con: People have the ability to do things they were not instructed to do, or even instructed not to do, and that are against their best interest, not due to a mistake, not even only for a greater good, but simply because they can, an action that would require them to have libertarian free will. When we read the story of Pandora's box, or Eve, and the Apple, we don't blink an eye, we empathise with the characters, because it's not outlandish, it is the natural result of a creature with free will.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.7.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4.3.2. Con: The text of Genesis doesn't claim that the tree of knowledge was intended as a test of free will.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4.3.2.1. Con: The "tree as test" interpretation of the story, along with a similar one of Pandora's box, is somewhat popular.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4.3.3. Con: One example of free will making mistakes, doesn't show that making mistakes is a necessary requirement for free will.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4.3.3.1. Con: Everyone makes mistakes, so even with only one example, the evidence is in favor of the necessity.

1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.4.6. Pro: If we ignore the first sentence, then I agree that it is not valid to expect from one aspect of God's perfection to deny other perfection. That is a contradiction in logic, not in God.

1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.3.2.7. Con: To contradict one's nature is an ability. The lack of such an ability is a limit to God's power and therefore 'counts against' His omnipotence.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4. Pro: In order for morality to be objective, its source must also be objective and unchanging. The universe and all of its contents are contingent and therefore not objective. So it follows that the moral law-giver must be transcendent and necessary.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: The nonexistence of the universe is entirely possible and has, in fact, occurred.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: The Universe \(i.e. our universe or whatever multiverse of which it may be part\) began to exist \("began to exist" defined [here](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/scholarly-writings/the-existence-of-god/must-the-beginning-of-the-universe-have-a-personal-cause-a-rejoinder/) at definition A5\)
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: A universe like ours that did not begin to exist is philosophically incoherent because it implies the formation of a concrete actual infinity by successive addition of events in time
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: According to the [b-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-theory_of_time) of time, all time exists at once and therefore there is no need to traverse it.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #17746: A-theory or B-theory of time?
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: It is impossible to traverse an infinite number of past events of finite size. Consider:

A. If one started today to count an infinite number of days, they will never reach the end of that sequence. Every day counted would leave them an infinite number of days away.

B. In an infinitely old universe, a day must exist that is an infinite number of days prior to now. 

These two statements are mutually-exclusive and cannot both be true, yet both must be true in an infinitely old universe.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: A universe like ours that did not begin to exist is philosophically incoherent because it implies the concrete existence of an actual infinity
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Actual infinities are near-unanimously accepted as a legitimate concept of mathematics leaving no room to doubt the possibility that it could be instantiated in the real world
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Near-unanimous acceptance as a mathematical concept is irrelevant.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Strict logical or mathematical coherence is not identical to metaphysical possibility, which is restricted by additional intuitions, conceivability considerations, or various other things depending on your epistemology of modality
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.1.2. Con: There is not a consensus in mathematics. Intuitionism, constructivism, and anti-platonism all do not consider concrete actual infinities to be possible for one reason or another
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.2. Con: Actual infinities exist.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Continuum - If space is continuous, there are an infinite number of infinitesimal points in any space interval. If time is continuous, there are an infinite number of instants in any time interval. \(see [plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity/) for a scholarly summary and or [www.quora.com](https://www.quora.com/Is-a-line-made-up-of-infinite-points) for a popular summary\)
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: We can treat a line as logically proceeding its division into parts and points such that points only exist after we specify them and therefore will always be finite.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: This assumes a controversial view of space-time structure when space and time might be quantized \(see [www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-time-quantized-in-othe/) for a popular summary\)
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.2.1.3. Con: Though worded to describe physical things, these are examples of numerical infinites, not actual infinites.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Spacetime - the four-dimensional universe might be infinite in its 4D volume given that science suggests the universe will expand indefinitely into the future
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Scientific evidence can never justify the future being endless. All theories will fail to be predictive beyond some finite time in the future. Said another way, it will always be consistent with empirical evidence that the universe will come to an end given enough time
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.2.2.2. Con: This assumes a [B-theory of time](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time/#TheBThe) and would be undermined on an A-Theory of time
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.2.3. Con: An actual infinity could never be observed to exist in principle \(i.e. our experience can only be of finite things\), leaving only the usefulness of infinity in some theory to be potential evidence that one exists
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.3. Con: Actual infinities are entailed by theism.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: God’s omniscience involves an actually infinite number of thoughts in God’s mind or the grasping of an infinite number of propositions
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: God's thoughts are a unified whole and not something consisting of parts
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.3.1.2. Con: It is not apparent than there are an actually infinite number of true thoughts.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: The proposition "1 is less than 2" is a true and is a thought that one might have. The same goes for "2 is less than 3" and so on. If each of these is considered a single thought in the mind of God, than God has an actually infinite number of true thoughts given that the integers form an abstract actual infinity and God hold to all these thoughts.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.3.1.3. Con: It is not obvious how one would isolate one single thought so that it might be counted.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.3.1.3.1. Con: As a general claim for all sentient creatures this is false. The notion that humans can "focus" or "concentrate" implies that they have distinguishable thoughts that can be more or less paid attention to. Or consider how counting to 10 involves at least 10 separate thoughts entering one's mind. While an exact line cannot be drawn between thoughts, that doesn't imply the thoughts are not distinguishable enough to be numerable.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.3.1.4. Con: A thought is an immaterial entity; immaterial entities are not subject to the physical bounds of time and space which constrain actual infinities of physical entities.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Heaven is defined to be eternal and thus time in heaven must go on infinitely into the future. Nothing distinguishes such an infinite future from an infinite past in a relevant way. Therefore, accepting the possibility of the former implies one accepts the possibility of the latter.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: It is incorrect that an infinite past is the same as an infinite future. Past infinity is an absolute infinity; future infinity is only a potential infinity.

If the past is infinite, then an actually-infinite number of seconds has already elapsed. But if the past is finite and the future is infinite, then the total number of seconds elapsed will always be a finite \(albeit very large\) number.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: This must assume a controversial [growing block view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_block_universe) of spacetime \(i.e. an infinite past is a static actually-infinite block while the future doesn't exist\). On presentism and standard B-theory views of spacetime, the future and past are metaphysically identical, equally non-existent or equally real respectively. For these more mainstream views, the use of tensed language \(e.g. "has already elapsed"\) is not metaphysically meaningful. \(see [Wes Morrison paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d08b/f8e00b0cf4a9f61febf951cbf44778e074ee.pdf), [Bill Craig Rebuttal](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/scholarly-writings/the-existence-of-god/taking-tense-seriously-in-differentiating-past-and-future-a-response-to-wes/), [Wes Rebuttal](http://spot.colorado.edu/~morristo/reply2craig-forthcoming.pdf)\)
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.3.3. Pro: If infinities do not exist then God cannot be omnibenevolent nor omnipotent.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.3.3.1. Con: This commits a category error. Omnipotence and omnibenevolence are qualitative properties; an infinite regress of events is a quantitative property.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.4. Pro: The possibility of an actual infinity leads to absurdities as [various thought experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Paradoxes_of_infinity) can illuminate for any sincere inquirer \(e.g. Hilbert’s Hotel, Infinite Library, Benardete’s Big Read, various supertasks\)
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.4.1. Con: A thought experiment is not a stand-alone argument. An informative articulation of the source of the absurdity must occur \(e.g. formulate into a deductive argument\) instead of simply relying on vague gut reactions to a story
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.4.1.1. Con: These thought experiments are often paired with such articulations of the source. For example, one thing illustrated by the Hilbert's Hotel paradox is the following deductive argument: \(1\) If an actual infinity is possible, then set A being a proper subset of set B does not imply A is smaller than B; \(2\) A being a proper subset of B does imply A is smaller than B; \(3\) Therefore an actual infinity is not possible
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.4.1.2. Pro: Paradoxical ideas about actual infinities stem from their counter-intuitive nature and not from any actual/physical impossibility.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.4.2. Con: The examples, if they cannot be resolved, only exclude certain kinds of actual infinities and cannot be generalized to the type of infinity that an eternal past is or the types of infinity entailed by an eternal past, if it entails any other infinities at all.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.4.3. Con: [Thompson's Lamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson%27s_lamp) has a solution: the lamp is on or off randomly \(with a probability of 50%\) after being on and off at the same time \(via being turned on and off infinitely fast - ie. simultaneously\). Thus this paradox is one of either lack of information or erasure of information, and can have a logical solution while assuming the existence of infinities.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.4.4. Con: The [Ross–Littlewood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross%E2%80%93Littlewood_paradox) paradox has various solutions depending on the exact variant, but it has perfectly consistent solutions \(one for each variant or the problem\) when we turn to physics. It is therefore not a problem with infinities.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.4.4.1. Pro: After adding infinite objects  we will have infinite objects. After adding 2 objects and subtracting one over and over for an infinite time, we have infinite objects. After adding n objects, if we add and subtract an equal number of objects we end up with n objects. Thus all conclusions are self consistent and the paradox resides in equivocating different physical actions under the same abstract concept, which leads to the erring assertion that their outcomes should be the same.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.4.5. Con: The [Grand Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel) "paradox" is provably true, therefore not illogical \(and therefore only paradoxical in the sense of being counter-intuitive\).
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.4.6. Con: [Galileo's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo%27s_paradox) poses no issue with infinities, it just shows that they are unquantifiable \(which is perfectly in line with the meaning of infinite\). It also shows that some infinities are faster moving/growing than others \(ie. someone who runs forever will always be ahead of someone who walks forever\), which is compatible with our experience and with the definition of infinity.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.4.7. Con: [Zeno's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes) has been demonstrated fallacious \(and ends up not being paradoxical at all\) - as the sum of the infinitesimal quantities add up to a finite quantity disproving it's solution and achieving a solution which is perfectly compatible with our every day experience.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.4.7.1. Con: Zeno’s paradox shows that there really isn’t an infinite number of spaces between two points.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.4.7.2. Pro: Zeno assumes an infinite number of tasks cannot be completed in a finite amount of time. This assumption is false \([supertasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertask#Zeno)\).
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.5. Pro: An actual infinity is metaphysically absurd because its mathematical validity requires accepting the non-obvious [axiom of infinity](https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Infinity,_axiom_of) and rejecting the mundane notion of [proper subsets](https://mathinsight.org/definition/proper_subset) having a smaller [cardinality](https://brilliant.org/wiki/cardinality/)
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.6. Con: The Kalam argument presumes at least the causation principle \(in the same way science does\), which allows for infinite regress, even though this thought be abhorred.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.6.1. Pro: Democritus artificially introduced the atom to stop the abhorred infinite regress into ever smaller sizes, but atoms can be and have been split, showing at least this infinite regress to be possible.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3. Pro: [Big Bang theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang), the most widely accepted cosmological model, holds that the Universe began to exist.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.1. Con: Even if the age of the universe is finite \(which we do not know\), that would not suggest or support in any way the existence of a god.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.2. Con: The argument uses misleading language, as 'began to exist' does not mean what one would think it does.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.3. Pro: The [Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem](https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/gr-qc/pdf/0110/0110012v2.pdf) shows that any system which is, on average, expanding throughout its lifetime, must have had a temporal beginning in its past. This applies regardless of the system's properties.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.3.1. Con: The class of cosmologies satisfying [Borde-Guth-Vilenkin](https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/gr-qc/pdf/0110/0110012v2.pdf) are not limited to inflating universes. Of particular interest is
the recycling scenario  in which each comoving region
goes through a succession of inflationary and thermalized
epochs.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: In some versions of the cyclic model the brane spacetimes
are everywhere expanding, so [this theorem](https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/gr-qc/pdf/0110/0110012v2.pdf) immediately
implies the existence of a past boundary at which boundary conditions must be imposed.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.3.1.2. Con: In other versions, there are brief periods of contraction, but the net result of each cycle is an expansion. For null geodesics each cycle is identical to the others, except for the overall normalization of the affine parameter. Thus, as long as Hav \> 0 for a null geodesic when averaged over one cycle, then Hav \> 0 for any number of cycles, and [this theorem](https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/gr-qc/pdf/0110/0110012v2.pdf) would imply that the geodesic is incomplete.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.3.1.3. Con: When accounting for quantum phenomena the universe is predicted to have had [no beginning](https://phys.org/news/2015-02-big-quantum-equation-universe.html).
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.3.1.3.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.3.3. Con: The Universe is not necessarily expanding as once thought. There are other potential explanations for the red-shift in light that we observe from distant bodies.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.3.3.1. Pro: The Earth is moving spirally at a high velocity. The solar orbital velocity, 66,000 mph, must be added or subtracted to/from the galactic orbital velocity, 483,000 MPH, and the galaxy itself is moving at 1.3 Million mph. Our relative velocity cycles from 751 kmph - 1,849 kmph. [astrosociety.org](https://astrosociety.org/edu/publications/tnl/71/howfast.html)
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.4. Pro: If our universe was infinitely old it would have undergone heat death long ago, and it hasn't.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.4.1. Con: Our universe would not be heat dead if it didn't have activity for an infinitely long period of time \(ie. by being quantum mechanically infinitesimally probable to suffer any change during it's infinitely long initial stage\).
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.4.1.1. Con: "Infinitely long" implies that time was existent during this time, which is philosophically impossible.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.4.1.2. Con: This ignores [Brownian motion](https://www.britannica.com/science/Brownian-motion). If the assertion is that even Brownian motion did not happen, then it appears that the universe was already in heat death.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.4.2. Con: Our universe would not be heat dead if it undergoes a cycle that restores it to a state of low entropy.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.4.2.1. Con: Without an external source of energy, such a cycle would lose energy after every iteration, like a basketball losing energy after every bounce unless it is being dribbled.

After a long, but finite number of cycles, the universe would indeed suffer heat death. In an infinitely old universe, this would have happened an infinitely long time ago.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.5. Con: Cosmologists propose a beginning for the current timeline of the universe, not for the universe as a whole.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.5.1. Pro: The current timeline of the universe is defined as events which occurred since the rapid expansion. It is not known if the universe as a whole extend beyond this point. The current timeline is the universe as we know it today, whereas the universe as a whole may possibly extend past that point.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.5.1.1. Con: The "compact universe" before its expansion still needs a cause for its existance.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.5.1.2. Con: The universe's expansion requires a cause. Otherwise it would have stayed in its state.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.5.2. Con: It is unclear that there is a meaningful distinction between "current timeline of the universe" and "the universe as a whole."

1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.8. Pro: The [Gott-Li model \(Closed Timelike Curves\)](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9712344) does not hold that the universe began to exist.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9. Con: Multiverse theories fail by every philosophical measure.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.1. Pro: Multiverse theories have low explanatory scope, since they don't explain any data other than the fine-tuning of the universe. In contrast, theism explains the existence of the universe and of objective morality, as well as many miracle claims and subjective experiences.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.1.1. Con: The multiverse theory can be treated as part of a larger philosophy of naturalism that also aims to explain all things theism attempts to explain. Then they would have the same explanatory scope.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.2. Pro: Multiverse theories are very unparsimonious, since they posit a bafflingly large number of entire universes that cannot be observed. Theism only proposes a single extra entity.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.2.1. Con: This assumes parsimony concerns limiting the number of entities as opposed to the number of types of entities. God would represent a significantly distinct class of entities not present in naturalism. Many people's intuitions may consider this less parsimonious than adding more universes like our own.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.3. Pro: Multiverse theories are ad hoc, since the existence of causally disconnected universes isn't very plausibly supported outside of its use as an answer to fine-tuning. Theism is supported by other arguments, as well as by the subjective experiences of many.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.3.1. Con: Max Tegmark's [mathematical universe hypothesis](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1zt/the_mathematical_universe_the_map_that_is_the/) gives a philosophical framework for the nature of existence that implies a form of multiverse.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.3.1.1. Con: It's not clear that consciousness can be simulated by purely mathematical processes.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.3.1.1.1. Pro: [Quantum mechanics has shown](http://henry.pha.jhu.edu/aspect.html) that consciousness isn't describable by purely physical processes.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.3.1.1.2. Pro: The [Chinese room argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room) holds that simulating consciousness within non-conscious systems is impossible.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.3.1.1.2.1. Con: The Chinese room argument is a hypothetical scenario, and merely purports to show how the illusion of consciousness may not be actual consciousness, not that creating, or even simulating consciousness is impossible
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: By [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) \(parsimony\) there would be no need for the additional entity of conscious experience to explain the behavior of the machine or Room.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.3.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: There is no explanation for the behavior in the scenario, simple or otherwise.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.3.1.1.2.2. Con: The Chinese room thought experiment demonstrates an entity that is incapable of performing a task, speaking Chinese, can have components added that allow it to appear to perform this task. It extends this argument to say the same is true of computers that appear conscious. However, this ignores that the thing between the first entity, and the audience, is itself an entity. And this entity as a whole can perform this task, thus could be considered conscious.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.3.2. Con: Multiverse theories build on principles of cosmology developed and verified while explaining various phenomena within our universe. Therefore, extending these ideas to explain the phenomena of fine-tuning and the origin of our universe is motivated hypothesis building as opposed to pure ad hoc stipulation.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.3.3. Con: This assumes the existence of God is supported by other arguments \(see Cons for the head claim of this debate \(i.e. God exists\) as well as those underneath the Pros for the head claim\)
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.3.4. Pro: See the Pros for the head claim of this debate \(i.e. God exists\)
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4. Pro: Multiverse theories have low explanatory power: P1. A perfectly random system is more likely to produce simpler results than more complex ones P2. There are simpler possible universes than ours which contain conscious beings P3. We should expect to find ourselves in the most common situation that produces observers \(Copernican principle\) C. Under multiverse theories, our existence in this universe is unlikely
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1. Pro: By contrast to the multiverse theory, a conscious creator could have many valid reasons to create a more complex universe like our own.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1. Pro: Since God isn't limited in time, resources, or motivation, He would have no reason to prefer a simpler/smaller universe, and so simple created universes are no more likely than more complex ones.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1. Con: There is no reason God would make things unnecessarily complex, especially without taking full advantage of what has been created, of the two possibilities, simpler makes more sense.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.1. Con: It is possible that a simpler/smaller universe would result in fewer saved souls or overall less moral goodness in the world.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: An omnipotent being could save all souls if it wanted to, so it does not make sense that adding more would decrease the number of souls saved.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Salvation requires free choice by the saved. It is definitionally impossible to force a creature to freely choose something, so God would not be able to do this.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: an omniscient God that would be able to know that a bigger universe would mean less saved souls would be able to direct the universe in such a way that more souls were saved.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.2. Con: The complexity/size of the universe may have been intended to show the smallness and fragility of human life, encouraging humility.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: A huge inhabited universe would do this better, as there would be more life, more civilizations to show just how insignificant the individual was.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Insignificance of the entire human race may be preferred, to encourage humans to seek fulfillment in a larger purpose, rather than individual insignificance which can be remedied by economic or governmental power.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: More sentient life in the universe does not necessarily require more human life.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: The bigger things are the harder they are for someone to control through personal power in any form.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.2.2. Con: There is no need for such a Universe to achieve that effect. Plenty of mundane, earthly experiences encourage humility much more easily than exploring the cosmos.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.3. Con: The complexity/size of the universe may have been intended specifically to add weight to the teleological argument and bring more people to belief.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.4. Con: The complexity/size of the universe results in great beauty, which a perfect creator would prefer.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.4.1. Con: A creator would prefer a beautiful, densely inhabited universe more.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: There may be any number of reasons why an arbitrarily large number of inhabitants is not preferable to the creator.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Any reason why God would not value a large number of inhabitants works equally well for God not valuing any inhabitants.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: "I want the inhabitants to have an arbitrary large and unchallenged space to develop during eons" is a reason that works for valuing a single source of inhabitants and not for zero inhabitants.

1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.2. Con: The universe looks complex to us because we are a part of it, and one can't accurately, and completely model something they are a part of
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.2.1. Con: This doesn't show that the universe is not complex or that simpler, consciousness-producing universes cannot exist.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.2.2. Con: One doesn't need a complete or fully accurate model of something in order to judge its complexity.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.2.2.1. Con: If our brains were so simple that we could understand them, we would be so simple that we could not understand them, because this is an example of something trying to model itself. Any model that we could make would need to necessarily be quite crude, because an accurate one would need to be all encompassing, and anything we want to model that can model itself needs to be able to do other things.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.2.2.1.1. Con: This statement isn't true in all possible worlds. In a universe with different laws, much simpler intelligent systems are conceivably possible.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Suppose a computer has a total of N possible states. Suppose there is something outside of the computer in the universe, so the universe has at least N+1 possible states. With zero overhead, each state of the computer can correspond to a state of the universe, but since the universe has more states than the computer, some states of the universe will map to the same state of the computer, in which case the simulation will not be able to distinguish between them.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.3. Con: Just because there are simpler "possible" universes than ours does not mean that the universe is all that complicated. The rules guiding this universe are relatively simple.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.4. Con: A simpler model that allows for sentient beings has not been presented.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.4.1. Con: A [Boltzmann Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain) type universe allows for sentient beings and is simpler than the multiverse.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.5. Con: Multiverse models are not required to be completely random in the universes they generate. They can, in principle, have motivated constraints on the types of universes generated within the multiverse which would lead to universes like ours being among the most probable.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.5. Pro: Multiverse theories are unfalsifiable, since it is impossible by definition for a causally disconnected universe to interact with our own. Theism is at least possibly falsifiable, since God would be able to interact with the universe.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.5.1. Con: The multiverse theory [predicts](http://140.119.115.32/sa/pdf.file/en/e032/e032p066.pdf) that the vacuum energy is probably nearly as far from zero as possible for a universe capable of supporting sentient life, whereas a single finely-tuned universe ought to have it at exactly zero; this constitutes a testable prediction.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.5.1.1. Con: There is no reason to assume that a creator would be compelled to make the vacuum energy zero.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.5.2. Con: Most multiverse models allow for causal interaction between universes. At the very least there is interaction between our universe and the universe within/from which our universe arose. Depending on this process, various marks might be left on our universe to hint at what came before. No such evidence has been observed allowing us to falsify various multiverse models.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.10. Con: If there is a cosmological model of a universe with an infinite past, that is better supported by current evidence, it would replace the Big Bang as the mainstream theory.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.4. Con: [A5](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/scholarly-writings/the-existence-of-god/must-the-beginning-of-the-universe-have-a-personal-cause-a-rejoinder/) is not the natural definition of 'began to exist'. \(A1 is the natural definition\). Definition A5 was deliberately created so that the Kalam cosmological argument could retain its [appealing-to-common-sense form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalam_cosmological_argument#Form_of_the_argument).
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.4.1. Con: A5 may be philosophically technical but it has to be in order to capture all the various usages of phrases like "begins to exist", "the creation of", or "came into existence" that appear in various popular sources discussing cosmology as well as our mundane usage in everyday life. One can find this phrase being used in a non-A1 sense by [cosmologists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgpvCxDL7q4) \(skip to 5:40\) or [generic science blogs](https://www.space.com/13347-big-bang-origins-universe-birth.html) with no interest in the Kalam argument
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.2. Con: According to the [b-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-theory_of_time) of time the universe has always existed.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: No argument has been put forth for the impossibility of the universe's nonexistence. In the absence of such an argument, our default assumption should be that since the universe's nonexistence is conceivable it is logically possible, and therefore it is contingent.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.2.1. Con: The default position is "I don't know." Any other claim should not be the default position and requires its own support.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.2.2. Pro: The claim "x is logically possible" is equivalent to the claim "x contains no logical contradictions." Evidence cannot be given for a lack of logical contradictions, except by disproving any proposed contradictions.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.2.3. Pro: According to [Sankara's dictum](http://alexanderpruss.com/papers/Samkara.html), anything which is logically impossible should be imperceivable and inconceivable, even within our imaginations.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.2.3.1. Con: We can conceive of many things that are impossible. [Like an eternal staircase.](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTY6fwSBxH2BrGaaDTRHN_ugELsaBwpLpfuvea9rdwpODmVhhIL) Or [a shape with 3 prongs but only two bases, and no splits.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FfqcjGXTtKs/maxresdefault.jpg)
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Impossible-shape illusions can be drawn and seen as two-dimensional representations, but not perceived mentally as actual three-dimensional objects.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1. Con: The reason illusions are  illusion is because our mind has rendered the objects, we are very good at filling in missing or incomplete information, what we see is not the 2D image that is actual represented at all, but rather a 3D object created in our mind.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.2.3.2. Con: We can imagine a world without logic where 1+1=3.
It would be chaotic and nonsensical to us, but we can imagine things that are nonsense.
The idea that we can only imagine things that are possible or logically possible or coherent is evidently false.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.2.3.3. Con: If this dictum were true no one would ever make a logical error. If we can't imagine things that are logically impossible we'd never make a logical error.
People are certainly capable of conceiving things and discovering later that they are logically impossible.
Indeed they still capable of recalling them and why they thought them possible even after discovering they are not.

Sankara's dictum is obviously false.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5. Con: Morality can't be transcendent, because different moral standards apply to different historical contexts.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: Cultural relativism states that the morality of an action is determined solely by its cultural contexts.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Cultural relativism is supported by moral disagreements between cultures.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Widespread disagreement in morality undermines the idea of "universal morality".
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Scientific disagreement is also everywhere, but it doesn't follow from this that the outside world doesn't follow reasonable rules, only that some people are mistaken about scientific truths.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Scientific claims rely on observable, verifiable evidence. Moralistic claims rely on relativistic interpretation based on cultural references. Science is objective, whereas morality is subjective. 

The outside world, and its rules, are neither all reasonable nor all unreasonable. It's a mixture of both. Filled with both objective scientific truths and a mix of subjective and often conflicting moralities, it follows that people would have trouble reconciling scientific truths and their faith.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Most general statements on morality are universally agreed upon by healthy societies. For instance, unjust murder is always considered to be wrong, as is thievery. Even if morality on the whole isn't universal, these general statements still require explanation.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Humans all have many similar traits, it is therefore coherent that humans would also share many the same relative morals.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Morality must be something more than shared human opinion. In 18th-19th century America, slavery was widely considered to be moral. If morality is merely "shared relative morals", then in their time and place, slavery was in fact, moral. Yet we rightly consider those persons today to have been morally flawed, even in their own time.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.3. Con: Universal morality isn't required for the moral argument to hold, only that moral statements have truth value and things are objectively right or wrong.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Morality can have objective truth even if no one knows of it.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.4. Con: The fact that people might disagree on a further point does not mean that originally they felt the same inclination towards agreeing with \(or disagreeing with\) that moral point. It could be \(and probably often is\) that a person convinces himself/herself of a particular moral point, thereby then finding evidential arguments for their holding of that moral view.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.5. Con: Disagreement about a concept "A" is warranted if and only if A actually exists. Therefore moral disagreement supports, rather than undermines, the idea that objective morality exists.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.6. Con: Disagreement in morality often derives from factual, not moral, error. For instance, witch hunts were once conducted on the erroneous assumption that witches could have negative effects on others and the world.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.6.1. Con: The contentious issue of abortion demonstrates disagreement in morality.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.6.1.1. Con: The debate of the morality of abortion largely comes down to two points, one of which is clearly a factual disagreement, rather than a moral disagreement;

Is the fetus meaningfully alive?

The other question, which is debatable less factual in nature, is if a pregnant individuals right to choose outweighs the right to life the fetus may, or may not have, but many people consider rights to be based in facts.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.2. Con: The divide between cultures isn't clear or well-defined - as such, the decision of which cultural moral framework to follow would depend on overarching moral rules. Those rules separating cultures cannot themselves be decided by any culture, and as such, at least some objective moral standards would have to exist.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.3. Con: Under cultural relativism, the moral framework decided on by a culture is true, and anyone who defies it is morally wrong. However, we agree that certain figures such as Martin Luther King acted morally, even though they defied the moral framework of the culture they lived in. This is known as the reformer's dilemma.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.6. Pro: All attempts to generalize morality into uncontroversial and exceptionless broad rules have failed to match perfectly with our moral judgments. As such it seems likely that morality isn't simplifiable or reducible to general axia, and requires situational judgments. Therefore, if morality is objective, it must be contained in an external mind able to make such judgments - and such a mind would be considered God.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.6.1. Con: Situational judgments are made by the minds of people, thus do not require God.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.5.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.8. Con: Morality may not have "objective truth." For example, controversial issues such as abortion and ethical dilemmas such as trolley problems and Singer's drowning child demonstrate that humans greatly disagree on certain moral issues.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.2. Con: Embodiment of a characteristic is distinct from being the cause of it. Regardless of whether or not God embodies what is right, this concept of what is right can and does exist independently of God. Thus, there is no distinct proof for the existence of God based on the existence of morality. Ultimately, then moral arguments for God still fail.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.2. Con: Atheist also have moral standards. Morality is not founded upon religion alone.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.6. Con: It is impossible to know a priori whether an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God could co-exist with evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.6.1. Pro: To rule out a prior the compatibility of divine omnipotence, divine omnibenevolence, and real evil, one would need to prove that there are in principle no justifiable reasons for God to permit evil to exist. To know this would require knowing all possible outcomes of evil in the world, knowledge which no human has or can have.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.6.1.1. Pro: It's impossible to say with any acceptable certainty that the state of the world isn't justified from God's perspective.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.6.1.1.1. Pro: Any given "evil" circumstance has results that can continue to affect other circumstances long after, and far away from, the original circumstance. [Chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) shows that accurately predicting, and therefore judging the weight of, these consequences is far beyond the scope of human intelligence.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.6.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no reason that an all powerful god would have to utilize chaotic systems to realize a certain outcome.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.6.1.1.1.2. Con: If God is omnipotent then God can do anything. If God can do anything, then good does not have to come from evil unless God decides that it must be the case. If God is omnibenevolent, God would not allow evil. Therefore, God would not require evil for good.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.6.1.1.1.2.1. Con: It may not be possible, even in principle, to have a physical reality with good and without evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.6.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.5.2.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.6.1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.6.1.1.1.3. Con: These consequences are not beyond the scope of God's intelligence. And a kind explanation from God is not beyond the scope of human intelligence.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.6.1.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.5.2.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.6.1.1.2. Pro: We cannot know what God is thinking.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.6.1.1.2.1. Con: We can if He choose to share.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.6.1.1.3. Con: Moral standards should be acceptable, for making a sensible claim. If God bothered to give us moral standards, then He should have also told us why He violates them. Jesus taught by example and by explanation. God should explain the contradiction, why is He not the way He was supposed to be. Suspicious silence about Himself, while being vocal about human moral  issues raise a reasonable doubt, that there is no any justification at all.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.7. Pro: An uncaring God is compatible with the existence of evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.8. Pro: If a God is all knowing and good, it should also know the future. If it is the case and it gives free will to people, knowing already that people will do bad, and then punishes them, this is either sadistic or perverted, so not good.
1.1.3.3.4.4.5.9. Pro: A fictional, non-existent God is compatible with the existence of evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.6. Con: If God were to prevent Evil, this would disrupt the laws of cause and effect, and cause greater unimaginable harms.
1.1.3.3.4.4.6.1. Con: This doesn't satisfactorily challenge the problem of evil. If god chooses not to prevent all evil, then he is not all good or not all powerful, no matter his reasoning.
1.1.3.3.4.4.6.2. Con: The claim that preventing evil would disrupt cause and effect is unsubstantiated.
1.1.3.3.4.4.6.3. Con: If evil were prevented, nothing could be harmful \(by definition\).
1.1.3.3.4.4.7. Con: The concept of evil only works if God does exist to define right and wrong. Without that, it's only an opinion.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1. Pro: Evil is a problem for atheism as well, because it is not clear what an atheist's moral basis for calling something evil is in a purely physical world.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.1. Pro: The fact that people presuppose evil exists in the acceptance of using it to refute a particular god suggests that they presuppose an objective moral arbitration, which requires a god.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.1.1. Con: At least some of our morals are rooted in some goal, or valuable concept of value.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Opposition to a subjective goal is not an example of objective evil. The existence of activity which opposes some person's subjective goals would in no way be considered evidence for the non-existence of a classical theistic god.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no evidence to support the assumption that all forms of morality that don't really on God are subjective.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.1.2. Con: Kant's moral dignity, social contract, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics; these are just some moral theories that we have come up with that don't require a god.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.1.2.1. Con: Kant's moral theory explicitly necessitates practical belief in god.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.1.2.1.1. Con: You can accept most of Kant's theory without agreeing that it necessitates a belief in god.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.1.2.2. Con: The mere existence of theories about morality does not imply their correctness and applicability to the real world. Although these views might govern the morality of a possible world, they do not account for morality in the real one.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Moral theories do not make a claim to the authority of their ideas of morality. They merely suggest possible explanations to behavior that is already observable and operative in the world.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.1.3. Con: The existence of morality doesn't imply an objective or absolute morality. Subjective morality is still morality.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.1.2.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.3. Pro: Another problem related to this is how humans are surprised by pain or feel it doesn't fit, in an age and world were pain is a common certainty: even some young children are only a bit upset to see animals torn apart by other animals, but are annoyed at minor injustice like littering. We would not expect this from a car: we know it fails in good time. But we often apply perfect standards to moral issues. To me this indicates a desire not explained by natural selection without a perfect guide.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.3.1. Con: If anybody expects others to act perfectly moral at times, this belief will either be quickly corrected by experience, excepting others as who they are because they either can't afford not to, or because they morally realize they can't do anything about it, or they will become a monster, seeing corruption everywhere but in themselves, and generally act like Judge Claude Frodo from the Hunchback of Notre damn, because even major moral failing are everywhere.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.3.2. Con: A car doesn't have feelings like me. I do have feelings and I do feel pain, which can be fully explained by evolution.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.3.3. Con: Being surprised by pain is a matter of not being used to it.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.3.4. Con: People have more empathy for people, because we are more used to people's expressions and also because understanding other people is evolutionarily advantageous.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.3.4.1. Pro: Understanding other people's pain and identifying \(even feeling\) that pain drives us to help members of our populations, directly increasing the chances of survival.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.4. Con: Atheism does not have a problem in defining evil. Empathy - which enables us to determine how we would feel about the experience - can be used to evaluate actions as good and bad.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.4.1. Pro: In addition to atheists, many religions also derive a sense of morality from the same basic impulse - empathy - which is why these religions are similar to each other.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.4.2. Con: Empathy may be useful to discover the moral state of an action, but it does not provide an ontological basis for evil. It may explain what is evil, but it seems inadequate to explain why an action is evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.5. Con: The existence of evil does not require a moral law beyond man, simply morals.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.1.2.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.5.2. Pro: Even devoid of some system, someone can believe things right, or wrong, which in turn would mean there are good, and evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.5.3. Con: A Universal position held by all men, \(such as "murder is wrong"\), suggests a Universal Mind.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.6. Con: Evil is defined as that which goes against humanity by humanists who do not necessarily believe in a god.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.6.1. Con: Humanists do not have the moral authority to make such a distinction.
If morality is defined by man himself, then man himself is free to rewrite the rules of morality as he pleases, whether he cares for social contracts, utilitarianism, or any other social theory or not.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.6.1.1. Con: Those who claim to be acting morally without reason do so without authority, but Utilitarianism is based on reason, social contract is based on reason, Kant's work is based on reason, these systems, and many more draw there authority form the reason, and logic on which they were built.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.6.1.2. Con: Humanism is not defined by man himself. It is defined by a rational exploration of what hurts and helps humanity. It exists independent of any given mind.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.2. Con: Evil can be defined in terms of threats and degradation of human wellbeing. In the problem of evil. If you're enduring something avoidable and unpleasant, that is evil. 

Compare this to pain. Some people enjoy pain. So it's not suffering. It's actually thrilling or stimulating. Such people might not enjoy ice-cream. Thus being made eat some would be a low degree of suffering. It an objective description of subjective experience.

God doesn't define evil or suffering, our experience does.
1.1.3.3.4.4.7.3. Con: Indeed, it might just be an "opinion." Many atheists do not accept an objective moral standard. However, classical theists generally subscribe to such a standard, and this can still be used against them in an argument by contradiction.
1.1.3.3.4.4.8. Con: The description of the problem of evil leaves out all self-determining life besides God. If humans are created in God's image, that includes self determination and free will. For God to 'do away with all sin' requires limits to be placed on self determination, essentially changing life from 'created in God's image' to 'automatons obeying the will of God'.
1.1.3.3.4.4.8.1. Con: There is a distinction between a perfect agent and a perfect automaton. It is supposed that in heaven, humans will all maintain their free will while simultaneously being free of evil. God could have created humanity like that in the first place. In other words, rather than creating humans that can't sin, God could have created humans that won't sin.
1.1.3.3.4.4.8.1.1. Con: Those would not be free willed agents. They would be good because they know nothing else, not because of their choices. Humans are said to be created in God's image, requiring them to have the ability to choose. Access to heaven is contingent on sacred choices in the face of evil, not sacred choices in the absence of any other possibility.
1.1.3.3.4.4.8.2. Con: "Self-determination" and free will are illusions. All human behaviour emerges, ultimately out of things that were not "determined" or chosen by the human themselves. 

Genetics, upbringing, brain chemistry, literally the entire universe, is not chosen, they are determined by something preceding the "self" on every single occasion. 

This, doesn't change by the way with a "soul", you also don't choose your soul.
1.1.3.3.4.4.8.3. Con: This argument is self-defeating. If an inability to sin places limits on free will, then God has no free will. Hence he should be able to create humans without it too. If instead an inability to sin does not limit free will, then God should be able to create humans with free will and without sin.
1.1.3.3.4.4.8.4. Con: This ignores ['natural evil'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_evil) where natural disasters etc cause huge amounts of suffering.
1.1.3.3.4.4.8.5. Con: This condition is already set by classical theism's definition of God. An omniscient, omnipotent being must necessarily be the only morally responsible agent in existence. The freedom of other beings to exist or do anything at all is contingent upon the approval \(or ignorance\) of the one who can make and unmake at will.
1.1.3.3.4.4.9. Pro: The moral argument for the biblical god seems to run into the problem of the existence of evil. The god of the bible also does not set a good moral example, decimating cities and inciting people to dash out children's brains or asking them to sacrifice their children as a test of loyalty and many other torturous acts besides.
1.1.3.3.4.4.10. Pro: The Epicurean Paradox: If God is willing to prevent evil, but is not able to then he is not omnipotent.
If he is able, but not willing  then he is malevolent.
If he is both able and willing then whence cometh evil.
If he is neither able nor willing then why call him God? [Epicurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus)
1.1.3.3.4.4.10.1. Con: It is not true that an omnipotent, omnibenevolent God must always and at all times remove all evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.10.1.1. Con: The idea that god follows utilitarian theory is let down by babies and infants dying of medical conditions, such as cancer, where there is no societal benefit.
1.1.3.3.4.4.10.2. Con: Evil is anthropocentrically ill-defined and hugely subjective; things that we think are natural Evils to us \(like diseases, natural disasters and death itself\) serves themselves as Good to the world, abiding by the scientific laws that govern them.
1.1.3.3.4.4.10.2.1. Pro: God should not change the science of the world specifically for us; if the whole of Creation is good \(Genesis 1:31\) then God doesn't owe his sustenance to us, but equally to everything in His Creation, all of which are products of His designed Science.
1.1.3.3.4.4.10.2.2. Con: The Epicurean argument does not assume that some things are objectively evil. A subjective concept of evil is enough to make the argument work.
1.1.3.3.4.4.10.3. Con: God may be able and willing to stop evil, and may in fact be doing so in His own time and in His own way for reasons of His own.
1.1.3.3.4.4.10.3.1. Con: According to the standard christian doctrine of hell, God does not even terminate evil, ever.
1.1.3.3.4.4.10.3.2. Con: The Epicurean paradox is concerned with the prevention \(and not the termination\) of evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.10.4. Con: Some goods may only be actualizable by allowing the possibility of evil.
1.1.3.3.4.4.10.4.1. Pro: Love, to truly exist, must be given freely. It cannot be forced from someone. To permit love to exist, one must allow for it to be withheld.
1.1.3.3.4.4.11. Pro: -> See discussion #1960: Because of the existence of evil, there cannot be a monotheistic God \(as traditionally conceived\).
1.1.3.3.4.4.12. Con: This argument limits existence to duality but ignores that Reality is fundamentaly non-dual.
1.1.3.3.4.4.12.1. Pro: Light and darkness is dual experience, but darkness has no existential basis - it is just subjectively experiencing lack of light. This means that in reality there is just light and that means reality is non-dual.
1.1.3.3.5. Con: Humans are said to be made in God's image - as free willed, self determining creatures. Enacting limits on that self determination - such as 'eliminating sin' - requires God to limit free will. Of the two - the ability to choose for oneself, and the choice of divine over profane behaviour - the former is the more fundamentally 'divine' characteristic. Moreover, this world may be no more than a testing ground - where humans learn the consequences of choices via trial and error.
1.1.3.3.5.1. Con: Free will is already limited: just try really hard turning into a guinea pig.
1.1.3.3.5.2. Con: This answer suggests that 'sin' is something that needs to exist without God having a say in the matter. However if God created everything, \(s\)he could have \(and given omnipotence and omnibenevolence, would have\) created the 'set of possible actions in the world' such that 'sin' wasn't in it. In that case, 'free will' would not be compromised.
1.1.3.3.5.3. Con: This argument is self-defeating. If the inability to sin constitutes a limit on free will, then God himself has no free will, and the "ability to choose for oneself" is certainly NOT divine. If instead the inability to sin does not limit free will, then God certainly should have created humans without sin and eliminated all suffering in the world.
1.1.3.4. Con: Anything that God can't do isn't problematic as the only things that God cannot do are acts contrary to his nature.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: Omnipotence is a matter of having the power to do anything, whether or not one chooses to use that power. God's desire to do an act is irrelevant when considering his ability to do an act.
1.1.3.4.2. Con: If you claim that omnipotence is the ability to do anything within one's nature, any human could claim to be omnipotent. Can't lift a rock? No problem. It simply wasn't within the nature of the person to be that strong. Of course, one could argue that every being, including the classical gods, are omnipotent, but that rather defeats the purpose.
1.1.3.5. Pro: God cannot do what He does not will to do. Likewise, God can only do what He wills to do.
1.1.3.5.1. Con: This is contradictory, because people can manipulate their will, so to be held back only by your will is not to be held back at all.
1.1.3.6. Con: Examples of things that God cannot do are logically nonsensical and meaningless \(e.g. make a square circle\).
1.1.3.6.1. Con: If a square circle is illogical and meaningless, then so is God. as his very nature \(outside space & time\) is also logically nonsensical and meaningless.
1.1.3.6.1.1. Con: This is a [non-sequitur](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/136/Non-Sequitur). Square circles are impossible because the two terms are mutually exclusive.  The claim that God exists outside of space and time has no inherent contradiction.
1.1.3.6.1.1.1. Pro: Many things exist outside of space and time - numbers, for example, or pieces of music, stories, abstract properties.
1.1.3.7. Pro: God cannot be all powerful because he can't prove his own nonexistence.
1.1.3.7.1. Con: All powerful God might be able to prove false statements. This is contradictory. By [principle of explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion?wprov=sfla1), this would allow him to prove any statements.
1.1.3.7.2. Con: "His Omnipotence means power to do all that is \[possible\], not to do the \[impossible\].... meaningless combinations of words do not suddenly acquire meaning simply because we prefix to them the two other words 'God can.'... It is no more possible for God than for the weakest of his creatures to carry out both of two mutually exclusive alternatives; not because his power meets an obstacle, but because nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk it about God." -- C.S. Lewis, The Problem of Pain
1.1.3.7.3. Pro: If God was all-powerful and therefore could prove his own nonexistence, and his proof would be correct and realistic, he would not exist. This is a contradiction.
1.1.3.7.3.1. Con: The argument begs the question by assuming the conclusion. "If God... could prove his own nonexistence, and his proof \[is\] correct... he would not exist."

Of course if he correctly proves that he does not exist, he would not exist!
1.1.3.7.3.1.1. Con: No the claim does not assume its conclusion. Just because certain proofs exist doesn't mean the reality agrees with the proof. Nor does it mean the proof is correct. But due to that, each step of the proof must be explicitly stated and justified.
1.1.3.7.3.1.1.1. Con: That the proof is correct is a given in the grandparent claim.
1.1.3.7.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Actually that part had to be explicitly assumed, otherwise the claim would not be sufficiently justified. But this is not in any way circular.
1.1.3.7.3.2. Con: It has not been shown that an all-powerful being can do illogical tasks, such as proving their own non-existence.
1.1.3.7.3.2.1. Con: By definition of all-powerful, a being is not all-powerful, if there exists tasks which the being is unable to perform.
1.1.3.7.3.3. Con: It has not been shown that an omnibenevolent being could lie by proving their non-existence when they actually exist.
1.1.3.7.3.3.1. Con: The claim is about whether all-powerful entities can do certain contradictory actions. The claim is not about omnibenevolence, which is unrelated.
1.1.3.7.3.3.1.1. Con: The claim is about the God of classical theism, who is omni-benevolent and cannot lie. If the grandparent claim imagines that God can lie, then it fails because it addresses a straw man god, not the God of classical theism.
1.1.3.7.3.3.1.2. Pro: Only omnipotence of God is needed to prove the contradiction. Omnibenevolence cannot avoid this problem because every notion of God that assumes God is omnipotent would be subject to same proof by contradiction.
1.1.3.7.3.4. Con: Even if an all-powerful being can do illogical tasks, it does not follow that He would do illogical tasks.
1.1.3.7.3.4.1. Con: The God of classical theism is not simply an all-powerful being, but He is also the source of morality and cannot lie.
1.1.3.7.3.5. Pro: It is not necessary for the proof that God actually performs any illogical actions. If God is able to perform illogical actions, then these must be consistent. Even if God never actually does such actions. By [Compactness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactness_theorem?wprov=sfla1), If they are consistent with the universe then assuming their occurrence cannot cause contradiction.
1.1.3.7.3.6. Pro: Clearly the abilities of an all-powerful being would be limited, if he cannot do such illogical action. The definition of "[all-powerful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence?wprov=sfla1)" would reject such limitation by definition, at least in their most strong form. Therefore all-powerful entities that can perform all, even absurd, kinds of illogical actions cannot exist. Hence, a God that is in such sense all-powerful does not exist.
1.1.3.7.4. Con: An all-good God would not lie, and therefore would never attempt to prove his own nonexistence.
1.1.3.8. Con: A better understanding of God's omnipotent nature is that: God can do anything that can be done, and that anything that can be done cannot be limited to my understanding of it.
1.1.3.9. Con: This is not a contradiction in the definition of God, rather in \(some of\) the theological systems devised to support certain religions. God is not the same as religion.
1.1.4. Pro: God's interactions with the world is inconsistent with God's divinity.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The tone of many religious texts is inconsistent, simultaneously stating that God is a perfect being, and yet requiring that God is praised. A perfect being would not need praise.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: God could request praise for the sake of God's devotees, rather than God's own sake.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: There are conceptions of God in classical theology, such as in the flood story, when God is conveyed as imperfect, or as having the ability to make mistakes.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.7.
1.1.4.1.3. Pro: A perfect entity needs nothing as it is, by definition, totally developed and unchangeable.
1.1.4.1.3.1. Con: An unchanging permanence is the definition of a statically perfect \(complete\) entity. God can be viewed as a dynamically perfect 'entity' - such as the water cycle on Earth. Since the water cycle arises out of basic principles - the transition of a specific compound \(water\) between solid-liquid-gas states in response to changing energy levels \(temperature\) - it has existed for billions of years, but still incorporates constant change.
1.1.4.1.4. Con: Religious texts incorporate centuries of human politics, not to mention the inefficiencies of transcribing, printing and publishing such documents on a mass scale without the aid of machines. The King James Bible, for instance, is probably pretty different from the one \(ones?\) that existed around 500 AD. Also, in a lot of verses/ quotations/ scriptures \(and in many religions\), 'praise' could also be read as 'worship' - an injunction to practice the preaching.
1.1.4.1.5. Con: Classical theists would not say that God "needs" praise, but is utterly self-sufficient.
1.1.4.1.5.1. Pro: According to the Christian Bible, God does not need our praise. However it is the right response when we understand who we are in relation to God and what he has done for us.  \(See [Acts 17:24-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+17%3A24-25&version=NIV)\)
1.1.4.1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.5.1.
1.1.4.2. Pro: If God responds to prayer, then this undermines his transcendence \(total independence from all else\).
1.1.4.2.1. Con: The use of anthropomorphisms regarding God is a common practice throughout the Bible, probably used metaphorically to help readers understand some of God's actions and attributes, rather than as a literal description of God's nature.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: Most modern theologians agree that intercessory prayer isn't effective, since it relies on the assumptions that God can learn something new \(invalidating His omniscience\) and/or change His mind \(invalidating His perfection\) based on your request. As such the rejection of intercessory prayer does not impact the existence of God.
1.1.4.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.7.
1.1.4.2.4. Con: Prayer does not inform God or change God's mind. It is God's eternal unchanging will that prayers be rewarded.
1.1.4.2.5. Con: Transcendence does not equate to independence - it means to “go beyond” or surpass. Therefore God can transcend creation yet still be in relation to it
1.1.4.2.6. Con: Mercy is an attribute of God. So are consciousness and will.
1.1.4.3. Pro: The apparent definition of God negates God as an existent being.  If God is the creator of all things, then God cannot be in the same category of the things created.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: God isn't in the same category of created things \(contingent\). By definition, God is eternal and necesary.
1.1.4.3.1.1. Con: The logical string that God could not have failed to exist only works if you believe he created the universe. God must exist only if you believe in God. If you don’t believe in God it is wholly possible that he cannot exist.
1.1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: If there is no necessary being to give origin to contingent beings, then there is no way contingent beings could have come to existence. Since contingent beings exist, there must be a necessary being to bring them to existance.
1.1.4.3.1.1.2. Con: Not so. God could exist even if He did not create anything.
1.1.4.3.2. Con: Not everything that exist is created.
1.1.4.3.3. Pro: The definition of God is self-contradictory in that he is beyond space but also omnipresent.
1.1.4.3.3.1. Con: God may affect space, even if space may not affect God.
1.1.4.3.3.1.1. Con: If God affects space, then God reacts to space and, therefore, space affects God.
1.1.4.3.3.2. Con: Omnipresent does not mean existing "within" space.
1.1.4.3.3.2.1. Pro: Modern understanding of space is within a space-time continuum. They cannot be addressed separately. 'God is beyond space' is strictly what Abrahamic religions claim. Illustration for an alternative opinion can be found in another monotheistic religion, Vaishnavism, where God says that He Himself is time [Gita 11:32](https://asitis.com/11/32.html) . In modern language, God is space/time.
1.1.4.3.3.3. Con: "Beyond space yet omnipresent." These are different expressions conveying the same idea. God is to his creation as an author is to his novel. Nowhere, yet everywhere.
1.1.4.3.4. Pro: The definition of God is self-contradictory in that he is beyond time but also eternal.
1.1.4.3.4.1. Con: God may be linked in some way to time and also be beyond it in other ways.
1.1.4.3.4.2. Con: God created time. It's like saying a relational human is self-contradictory just because they created unfeeling robots.
1.1.4.3.4.3. Con: Being beyond, or outside of time implies being eternal.
1.1.4.3.5. Con: God is in his own category. Everything that exists does so in a hierarchy between similarity and dissimilarity with God. A rock is like God only in the fact that it exists. A human is much more like god in the fact that they reason. But God himself is inherent to reality and the only entity that is such.
1.1.4.3.6. Con: If God is assumed to be the universe itself \(an oft repeated claim in religious and spiritual documents\), then at the instant of the big bang, there was nothing but God - the physical and metaphysical laws that govern everything we know - and an enormous amount of energy. From that initial point, we have evolved to the universe of today, in which everything that we know to exist is a result of what appeared in that first instant. Thus God is both creator of all things and within everything.
1.1.4.3.7. Con: The claim of God being the creator of all things implies a degree of common sense in its understanding. Namely, God created all things other than himself. The Bible asserts that God is eternal: "from everlasting to everlasting"; without creation; and therefore not in the same category as created things.  \(See Psalms 90 verse 2\)
1.1.4.3.7.1. Con: This negates the creation of reality, itself. Either God is the creator of reality, and he was outside of reality during its creation \(i.e., is not real\), or was within reality, and thus not the creator of all things.
1.1.4.3.7.1.1. Con: Reality isn't a "thing" per se, but only a metaphysical concept - the property of being real. As has been stated, God could not create reality while also being real, so there's no contradiction in saying that God did not create reality.
1.1.4.3.7.1.1.1. Pro: Classical theism doesn't claim that God created every concept and entity, only that He is the necessary cause for all contingent things. This is consistent with metaphysical concepts such as reality not being created by God.
1.1.4.3.7.1.1.2. Con: Concepts are things. If God didn't create them, then he didn't create everything.
1.1.4.3.7.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.7.1.1.1.
1.1.4.3.7.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.7.1.1.1.
1.1.4.3.7.1.3. Con: God exists in at least 6 or 7 dimensions this claim only makes sense when bound to 3.
1.1.4.3.8. Con: In classical theism, God is not the creator of all things simpliciter, but of all contingent things.
1.1.4.3.9. Con: Classical theists do not believe that God is in the same category as things created, and even His existence is qualitatively different from all other kinds of existence. Thomas Aquinas, a famous classical theist, conceived of God not as "a being" but as "Being Itself."
1.1.4.4. Pro: There are many cases where God is defined as good but claimed by believers to have done things which those same believers would consider bad if done by anyone other than God \(or someone claiming to be doing God's will\).
1.1.4.4.1. Con: As the author and rightful owner of all creation it is God's prerogative to do things that us, mere members of that creation, may not.

As [Isaiah 45:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+45%3A9&version=NIV) says, "Does the clay say to the potter, ‘What are you making?’"
1.1.4.4.1.1. Con: A sentient being can not be owned.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: A sentient being can be owned if the entity owning the sentient being is as supreme as God is understood to be.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: There is no proper analogy between God's right as an "owner" of his creation, and our rights as "owner" of our creations.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: When we create something we create it from "borrowed" ingredients. Everything down to the smallest particle was made by God and for God. We can not make anything the same way He made everything.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The argument that 'when we create something we create it from "borrowed" ingredients. Everything down to the smallest particle was made by God and for God. We can not make anything the same way He made everything" is somewhat undercut by the fact that it is a thing created without the use of any of these particles purely by a human.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If the Christian God exists, then the power of reason and logic are part of his nature and can then be said to belong to him. When we use these capabilities we are borrowing from God.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If the Christian God does not exist, we can still use our faculties of reason and logic. It's just that we would not describe it as "borrowing from God".
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Believing in a God as a presupposition to justify using reason and logic is rationally worse that presupposing reason and logic directly. [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Colossians 1:16 explains that the Christian understanding of God is that "by him \[God\] all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him."
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: If the Christian God exists, then our mental substance \(whether material or immaterial\) was created by God and when we exercise this mental substance to formulate arguments and thoughts we are borrowing from God.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: If a person were to conjure a sentient sandwich from the void, it would still be immoral to eat it.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Saying 'God is a special case, we can't hold them to the same standard' is the logical fallacy of special pleading.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Special pleading is making an *arbitrary* exception to a rule. God is in a unique position of authority and supremacy to every other being. It is a case of equivocation to assume that God is merely a human in different clothes.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Special pleading is not an adequate defense of the practice of special pleading.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Positing a God with unique position of authority and supremacy is arbitrary, no matter how ancient the notion.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.2. Con: It is special pleading and a cope out to make an exception for God. In effect and in the absence of the contrary, no degree of "supremacy" can prevent a sentient being from being its own individual.
1.1.4.4.1.2. Pro: The only person who can rightfully play God, is God.
1.1.4.4.1.2.1. Pro: The popular colloquialism "don't try to play God" is evidence that there is an idea of a being called God that holds proper authority to do actions that other beings do not hold.
1.1.4.4.1.2.1.1. Con: What people say, when not backed by adequate reason, is not a sufficient reason to do things, as people say things like that a mirror being broken containing one's reflection is bad luck, or will damage one's soul.
1.1.4.4.1.3. Con: The contradiction is not in the authority or capability to do something but the good or the bad property of something.
1.1.4.4.1.4. Con: Either an action is good, or it is not, the doer of the deed does not change this fact.
1.1.4.4.1.4.1. Con: The doer of the deed does sometimes have an impact on the morality of the action.
1.1.4.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: For a doctor with the proper medical know-how, cutting into someone's chest to save their life is moral. If the average Joe does the same thing then it is recklessly immoral.
1.1.4.4.1.4.1.2. Pro: If a police officer, acting under authority of the State locks up a prisoner in a jail cell, it is moral. If an average Joe does it, it is kidnapping.
1.1.4.4.1.4.1.3. Pro: If a soldier in wartime situation kills an enemy combatant, it is moral. If an average Joe kills the same person on a street corner in peacetime it is murder.
1.1.4.4.1.4.1.4. Con: The only examples of 'the does' changing the morality of the situation involve factors that fundamentally change the situation, an enemy combatant is not comparable to some Joe on the street, nor is a criminal awaiting do process, and random flailing is a substantially different act then performing a surgery one is qualified to perform.
1.1.4.4.1.5. Con: Power is not authority.
1.1.4.4.1.6. Con: If the sandwich you made suddenly grew a mouth, and started talking and thinking, it would not be moral for you to eat it, even though that was the purpose it was made for. This is true even if you knew it would become sentient.
1.1.4.4.1.6.1. Con: Us making a sentient sandwich is not analogous to the  supremacy of God's power in creating us.
1.1.4.4.1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.4.4.1.6.2. Con: There is no clear reason to believe that sentience is the criteria for moral consumption.
1.1.4.4.1.6.2.1. Con: Almost every moral system values moral actors.
1.1.4.4.1.6.2.1.1. Con: Sentience does not automatically imply moral agency.
1.1.4.4.1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: If sentience does not, it is unclear what does.
1.1.4.4.1.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Some animals appear to be sentient in a rudimentary sense but are not considered moral agents \(e.g. certain high primates\).
1.1.4.4.1.6.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This does not address the problem, if sentience does not demonstrate value, it is unclear what does.
1.1.4.4.1.6.2.1.1.2. Con: Almost every moral system values moral actors in some capacity.
1.1.4.4.2. Con: "Goodness" and "badness/evil" are irrelevant if they are only subjective constructions. One may consider something "bad", but be mistaken. For the argument to succeed, the action must be objectively bad.

Objective moral values and duties cannot exist unless God exists.
1.1.4.4.3. Con: It is possible that God exists but did not do what some believers claim that He did.
1.1.4.4.3.1. Pro: Many of the [genocides](https://zippycatholic.wordpress.com/2014/09/13/literal-insanity/) attributed to God are actually commanded by humans \(such as Moses\), and carried out by humans, not God.
1.1.4.4.3.1.1. Con: In many cases where God does not explicitly order the genocide, he encourages it or does nothing to stop it. This still makes God complicit in these genocides.
1.1.4.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.
1.1.4.4.3.1.2. Con: In the particular case of Amalekites \(1 Samuel 15\) God is unambiguously responsible for the genocide.
1.1.4.4.3.1.3. Con: In their historical contexts, it is likely that the biblical accounts did in fact intent to attribute these commands to God.
1.1.4.4.4. Con: It is possible for an omniscient and benevolent being to do things which would be immoral for finite creatures because of His ability to see and guide all ends.
1.1.4.4.4.1. Con: The ends do not justify the means.
1.1.4.4.4.1.1. Con: Ends can justify means, so long as they are sufficient to do so.
1.1.4.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: In the Bible, Rahab told a lie to the Jericho soldiers to protect Israelite spies. She is later spared by God during the attack because of her help. Joshua 2
1.1.4.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: If Nazi's are banging on your door, lying to protect the Jews that are hiding in your basement is justified.
1.1.4.4.4.1.1.3. Con: No end can justify the things God does, like the ordering of genocides, commuting genocides, and eternal torture.
1.1.4.4.4.1.1.4. Con: Examples involving lying seem to only suggest that lying is a justifiable means, so long as the end is sufficient, or perhaps that lying on it's own is not immoral, but they do not show that in general, ends can justify means, so long as they are sufficient to do so.
1.1.4.4.4.1.2. Con: There is no ending to something that is not yet structured completely or completed.
1.1.4.4.4.1.3. Con: The morality of a "being" that is so much more than what the sum of all humanity could ever be could never be as simple as humanity's morality. This sentence is debating humanity's morality not God's morality and it does so from a humane point of view, for we are not God if God exists and we do not have his moral compass.
1.1.4.4.4.1.4. Pro: For a human, the ends should not justify the means.
1.1.4.4.4.2. Pro: Yet the end may not be known unless it's past is already known therefore predetermined.
1.1.5. Pro: The definition of God as absolutely good is contradictory because 'goodness' is relative to one's moral views and there cannot exist a person or character that would seem good to every sentient being.
1.1.5.1. Con: What "seems good to every sentient being" is not the same as "absolutely good".
1.1.5.1.1. Con: This is the precise reason why absolutely good doesn't exist. A calamity for humans is very good for the animals that they would consume. Also, a destroyer of the solar system could spurn the creation of another with other life forms. For them, the destroyer is a good thing.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: If you claim that the only "good" that matters is the "good" of humans \(for example\), absolute good could exist in that sense.
1.1.5.2. Con: For a sentient being to recognize that some things are "good" and some are "evil" implies a recognition of a moral standard by which to distinguish between the two. Only God's nature is sufficient to be that standard.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: Morals are, to at least some extent, evolutionary. As such, no standard is required.
1.1.5.2.1.1. Con: God would be complete, therefore not evolutionary. The whole spectrum of possible evolutions of morals would be contained in God.
1.1.5.3. Con: Seeming good and being good are two different things. I personally feel most vegetables taste awful, though I know for a fact they're good for me.
1.1.5.4. Con: Maybe if the definition was rephrased – god being the absolute good, not being absolutely good – one would not run into a relativistic aporia.
1.1.5.5. Pro: Any interpretation of a God's actions would have to be made by humans, who are fallible. No person would be truly privy to the mind of God.
1.1.5.5.1. Con: Human interpretation is, however, the filter through which we perceive everything. To dismiss such human ability is to dismiss - among everything else - the very possibility of knowing whether God exists and also whether God does not exist.
1.1.5.6. Con: The concept of relative morality is incoherent.
1.1.5.6.1. Pro: If morality is relative, then each person gets to decide what is moral. However, this renders each of us incapable of saying what is moral or immoral for someone else. Such a morality is incapable of informing us of how we should treat others--yet, how to correctly interpersonal relationships is a huge part of our moral framework.
1.1.5.6.2. Pro: Relative morality cannot explain why any person would ever consider something that they did to be immoral or wrong.
1.1.5.6.2.1. Pro: Subjective, relative morality requires that the correct answer to any moral question be found within oneself. For this to be true, no objective moral truth can exist to override the subjective moral opinion of the individual.
1.1.5.6.2.2. Pro: If one's subjective moral opinion is the ultimate arbiter of morality, then when a person believes they have done something "wrong" or "immoral", they have only violated their own internal standard.
1.1.5.6.2.3. Pro: Given subjective, relative morality, one's moral standard cannot be applied to anyone other than oneself. To do so would be to assert that said morality is objective and universal.
1.1.5.6.2.4. Pro: When a consistent moral relativist believes they have done something immoral, they can only mean that they have violated their own internal code. This raises the question of why they would ever believe any action \(especially their own action\) to be immoral to begin with. The value of a moral code that can only apply to oneself is questionable in the extreme. It is of little value to believe that oneself should behave in a given manner, while not holding others to any standard at all.
1.1.5.6.3. Pro: Relative morality cannot explain why, in the absence of an objective morality, one would even have a moral sense to begin with.
1.1.5.7. Con: The good suggested by classical theism is the creator of the universe, and as such, would be an objective arbiter of morality unlike entities within the created universe which would only have a subjective view.
1.1.6. Con: Possible contradictions in classical theism may appear from transcription difficulties and errors introduced over centuries of existence.
1.1.6.1. Pro: The source ideas for classical theism - the Bible, the works of Plato, Aristotle, etc - had already existed in documented form for centuries before the classical period. The oldest Bible, for example, [is from 330-360 AD](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/5749555/Worlds-oldest-Bible-published-in-full-online.html). The multiple rounds of transcription and retranscription that preserved those source documents over the thousands of years to today are likely to have introduced errors/ caused loss of subtlety in the original conceptions.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: The oldest document of the Bible is the Septuagint with fragments dating back to 300BCE. \(Of course consisting only of the Old Testament as the events of the New Testament have not yet happened\).
1.1.6.1.1.1. Con: The Septuagint is itself the [translation into Greek of a number of earlier texts in Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint). While there are fragments of \(Hebrew\) Biblical text dating back to 300 BC \([and before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible#Origins_of_the_Hebrew_Bible_and_its_components)\), the oldest complete Bible \(compared to the book in its current form\) would probably be one containing both Old and New Testament - hence the date of 300 AD. In either case, an older Bible makes an even stronger case for transmission/ transcription errors.
1.1.6.1.2. Con: The original domcuments of the Bible were transcribed in several different locations, by several different monasteries, each with detailed systems in place to ensure as accurate a transcription as possible. An error made in one transcription did not infect the others due to their isolation. Therefore, we can cross examine these documents to identify and eliminate errors.[thebibleproject.com](https://thebibleproject.com/podcast/making-bible-part-2/)
1.1.6.1.2.1. Con: Comparing multiple independent transcripts does help with scribal error, but it does not guarantee *perfect* transmission. Another possible problem comes from the choice of certain sources as more authoritative than others. The [Masoretic Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoretic_Text), for instance, is considered the source book for the Hebrew Tanakh \(Bible\). Though there may be good reason to choose that source as more correct than others, this also ensures that errors/ interpretations in the Text itself become part of future canon.
1.1.6.2. Pro: One apparent contradiction in classical theism is that of a theistic God changing its mind. God, per [Plato](http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/~davpy35701/text/plato-god-immutable.html), is changeless because a\) nothing can change God, and b\) God would not change, because it is already perfect. Parts of the Bible, like God repenting the creation of humanity, therefore seem to contradict theism. The problem might exist because today's Bible carries an edited version of the source documents of the Old Testament. 'Repent' might not carry the subtleties of the original text.
1.1.6.3. Con: An omnipotent God should be able to keep the record of itself clear enough for it to be not contradictory.
1.1.7. Con: Apparent contradictions in classical theism may appear from translation difficulties.
1.1.7.1. Pro: The ideas within classical theism come from a number of thinkers, including those as far back as Plato and Aristotle. These ideas were not developed in English, and even in their native languages, were reliant on the context of their times for the subtleties of meaning involved. The version of theism we’re debating, off Wiki, is already a compressed version of a complicated concept developed in multiple languages and over several centuries. It would be more extraordinary if there were no errors.
1.1.7.2. Con: In theory, a perfect God would be capable of communicating to man in such a way that all possible translations of the original message would still be accurate. In other words, He could make the "word of God" fool-proof; a message so utterly perfect, no man could ever misconstrue or spoil it.
1.1.8. Con: The possibility of God existing in another dimension allows for the possibility of both immanence and transcendence.
1.1.8.1. Con: An 'alternate dimension' implies a space which is causally disconnected from ours. Therefore, even if an omnipotent being exists in such a place, it would be impossible for it to interact with us; nor could we identify such a being or place.
1.1.9. Pro: Omniscience, omnipotence and omnibenevolence are mutually exclusive.
1.1.9.1. Con: Because we have no full concept and no experience of these terms, perhaps they could actually be contingent on each other. 'Knowing all' may require 'all-power', and 'omnibenevolence' could be decided upon by the entity that fits this description.
1.1.9.2. Con: "Science" and "potential" are two sides of the same coin: Being aware of phenomena versus directly affecting phenomena. These two are NOT mutually exclusive, rather they are complementary to each other, therefore omniscience and omnipotence \(all-knowing and all-powerfulness\), as the supreme forms of both attributes, relate to each other in the same way.
1.1.9.3. Con: God's omnibenevolence can be taken for granted.
1.1.9.3.1. Pro: God decides what is good, therefore God's goodness is uncontestable.
1.1.9.3.1.1. Pro: God only answers to God.
1.1.9.3.1.1.1. Con: This paints God as a weight-pushing authority figure, which doesn't coincide with the definition of God as being completely good and benevolent.
1.1.9.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.2.
1.1.9.3.1.3. Con: God does not decide what is good. This is one horn of the [Euthyphro dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma), and would make good and evil arbitrary.
1.1.9.3.1.3.1. Con: Everything is arbitrary to the ultimate God. Primary principles of omniscience, omnipotence and omnipresence ensure that. However, God doesn't change \(immutability\), and this results in the definition of an absolute point of moral reference.
1.1.9.3.2. Pro: God has unlimited knowledge to determine his own goodness eternally, and he has unlimited power to become absolutely good eternally, therefore God is absolutely good.
1.1.9.3.2.1. Pro: The human concept of "good" does not apply to God.
1.1.9.3.2.1.1. Pro: The human concept of "good" is conditioned by our limited knowledge of, and limited power over our environment, therefore fallacious when applied to the absolute.
1.1.9.3.2.1.2. Con: Yet God passed his word/law onto his people, and by following that law/those words he deems them "good" enough to achieve eternal salvation. God, in the hypothetical of him existing, created us and our understanding of "good".
1.1.9.3.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.
1.1.9.3.2.2. Con: A necessary being cannot "become". God, as a necessary being, is fully actualized, has no potentiality, and cannot change.
1.1.9.3.3. Con: God's omnibenevolence can be exaggerated.
1.1.9.3.3.1. Con: A maximally-great being would be the greatest possible good; therefore, it is impossible to conceive of any greater good. This allows no possibility of exaggeration.
1.1.9.4. Pro: If your actions have to be benevolent, then you are not capable of doing anything.
1.1.9.5. Pro: An omnipotent being would be able to create something "unknowable", even if just a 'secret'. This contradicts omniscience.
1.1.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.10.
1.1.10. Pro: It is logically impossible for God to be omnipresent and having been there when there was nothing yet. The quality of God would have to include both 'existing' and 'not existing' simultaneously, therefore God is simply non-existent.
1.1.10.1. Pro: The dilema of an absolute being that contains everything is a variation on the paradox of the irresistible force. It is a false dilema. In this case it is a false dilema that points out that the "existence" cannot possibly be an atribute of an all-containing being.
1.1.10.1.1. Con: Other than a few panentheistic religions, few would support the idea of God being "containing" in any fashion.
1.1.10.2. Pro: Existence as a definition cannot explain the qualities of both [immanence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanence) and [transcendence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_\(religion\)) inherent to the "classical" view of God.
1.1.10.3. Con: Our incapable minds are insufficient to comprehend the wonders of God, and just because we don’t understand something does not mean that it is false.
1.1.10.3.1. Con: If we do not understand something, we should approach everything we think we know about that something with a certain amount of doubt. This does not seem to be the prevalent approach to God, however.
1.1.10.3.2. Con: While it is certainly true that our incapability to understand something does not make it false, there exist simpler explanations and theories for God's \(non\)existence than assuming some mystical ways in which to exist and not exist makes sense, which we can then just label wonders of God and be done with it.
1.1.10.3.3. Pro: There are many things in this Universe that we do not understand yet and there is possibility that God is one \(or all\) of these things.
1.1.10.3.4. Con: Our incapable minds are insufficient to comprehend many things, but for everything else, there is evidence that we can look for or look at, experiments that we can try to gain more knowledge and so on.
1.1.10.3.4.1. Pro: The only testifiable and shareable piece of evidence for God's existence are words and books made of these words.
1.1.10.3.4.1.1. Pro: A lot of claims in, for example, Bible have been proven as false, such as the existence of global flood at some point in our history, the age of the Earth and the Universe and so on.
1.1.10.3.4.1.1.1. Con: The Bible makes no claims regarding the age of the Earth, nor the universe. Some interpretations argue for an old earth; some for a new earth, but the bible itself does not directly address the issue.
1.1.10.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The issue is directly addressed in the Bible. 
The gospel of Luke contains a [genealogy of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy_of_Jesus#Luke's_genealogy). Comparing with the [genealogy from Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogies_of_Genesis#Genesis_numbers), one finds that the Earth and the universe should be approximately 6000 years old.
1.1.10.4. Pro: One of the cornerstones of the classical God is that it is everywhere, though it 's nowhere. It exists yet you cannot point your finger at it. Existence is too human a term to define such a being, regardless it actually may or maynot be.
1.1.10.4.1. Con: Omnipresence excludes being "nowhere". Nothing in the classical definition of God says that God is nowhere.
1.1.10.4.1.1. Con: The fact that God is a creator implies that it was there before there was anything.
1.1.10.4.2. Con: Being present does not necessarily imply being visible. Oxygen is present in the air, yet you cannot see it.
1.1.10.5. Pro: For God to be both the ultimate and encompass everything, they would have to include both 'existing' and 'not-existing' simultaneously.
1.1.10.5.1. Con: It is incoherent to say that something exists and does not exist simultaneously. Nothing in the classical concept of God indicates that even deity is capable of a logical impossibility.
1.1.10.6. Pro: God's higher property beyond existence is probably unfathomable to the human mind. Existence is therefore an unadequate term to use when talking about God.
1.1.10.7. Con: When "there was nothing yet", there was no place in the universe for God to be. Omnipresence is the quality of being at all places at all times. It is not inconsistent with omnipresence to say that God is not in a location that does not exist.
1.1.10.8. Con: -> See 1.1.10.5.1.
1.1.10.9. Con: God both 'existing' and 'not existing' simultaneously is not a mere contradiction that implies his non-existence. It looks more like a quantum superposition. [Schrödinger's cat.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat)
1.1.10.10. Con: This is based on the assumption that God is part of the universe, rather than separate from it. That is a logical fallacy in and of itself, since it would result in causa sui.
1.1.11. Pro: The classical definition of God ignores the elephant in the room, that it describes a being that deserves belief \(rather than just belief in its existence\) and everything that implies.
1.1.12. Pro: Attempting to define God without referencing belief is absurd.
1.1.12.1. Con: One or more powerful beings may exist, but attributing spiritual importance to such is specious.
1.1.12.1.1. Pro: Because the classical definition of God implies that God is spiritually important, the classical definition of God is specious.
1.1.13. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.
1.1.14. Con: If God cannot in principle exist, we should not be able to believe God exists.
1.1.14.1. Con: Children are able to believe in Santa Claus and other fairy tale characters, despite their non-existence. The belief in something does not imply its existence.
1.1.15. Con: Gödel has proven that any axiomatic system is either incomplete or contradictory. Therefore it is proven that truth beyond logic is possible.
1.1.16. Pro: God is perfection in it's being by man's definition. Imperfection would have to exist to prove perfection. So God would have to be imperfect to need imperfection to exist with God's perfection. Imperfection could not be if there is a God. God would not have need of anything imperfect if God is perfect.
1.1.16.1. Con: This does not follow. Perfection \(a standard\) is required for imperfections to exist, even in theory; but a standard of perfection can theoretically exist without anything failing to meet that standard.
1.1.17. Pro: The definition of God is self-contradictory in that he is all-knowing \(omniscient\) but there are things that God cannot know.
1.1.17.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.17.2. Pro: Humans \(and perhaps animals\) have free will. For this to be true, God could not know what their actions were going to be in advance, otherwise it wouldn't truly be free.
1.1.17.2.1. Con: Norman Swartz contends that arguments using free will to deny omniscience commit the [modal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_free_will#Omniscience_and_free_will).
1.1.17.2.2. Con: If God is outside time, as is often understood, then God sees all of history at the same time. We mortals are yet to discover what we will freely decide - but it is all visible to God.
1.1.17.2.3. Con: Even if God's foreknowledge must result in a fully determined universe, this would not make free will impossible.
1.1.17.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.
1.1.17.2.4. Pro: Free-will means that humans are free to make choices, which necessarily implies that their choices cannot be known a-priori. If an all-knowing God knows every choice we make before we make it, then it cannot be said that we have free-will.
1.1.17.2.4.1. Con: According to [compatibilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism) free choices can be made even if God knows them beforehand.
1.1.17.2.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.6.
1.1.17.2.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.4.
1.1.17.2.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.
1.1.17.2.4.2. Con: If I have a son who I know has an anger problem and already know that if event B follows event A, then he will respond in a certain way, then I have foreknowledge of his actions, and he has the free will to take such actions or to not.  This is an example of human foreknowledge in relation to the reality of free will.  God trancends even this in that he creates each individual human with traits such as confidence, kindness, self-control and love.  He knows all things and allows us free will.
1.1.17.2.4.3. Con: A-priori here means in advance and refers to something that does not exist. In other words, a non-being. God knows all the being, meaning all there is to be known.
1.1.17.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.1.4.2.3.
1.1.17.2.6. Pro: We seem to have free will because we are conscious.
1.1.17.2.6.1. Con: Our consciousness seems not to require free will as it happens in deterministic settings \(ie. cells\).
1.1.17.2.6.2. Con: Consciousness does not seem to require free will, as sugested by the ever more complex digital intelligence and understanding which don't rely on free will at all.
1.1.17.2.6.2.1. Con: A simulation of consciousness does not imply consciousness. The "complex" digital intelligences we have today are [vastly inferior](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25560-sentient-robots-not-possible-if-you-do-the-maths/) to a human mind.
1.1.17.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.1.17.4. Pro: The definition of God is self-contradictory in that he is omniscient but also [impassable](http://www.theopedia.com/Impassibility_of_God). Either God has experiential knowledge of suffering \(which violates impassibility\) or does not \(which violates omniscience.\)
1.1.17.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.17.4.2. Con: Not all classical theists would agree that God is impassable.
1.1.17.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.
1.1.17.5. Con: God \(as recognized by the three largest monotheistic religions\) is a being of incomprehensible nature. To posit that a human can even fathom what it means that God "knows" is to admit to a fundamentally flawed understanding of omniscience
1.1.17.5.1. Con: That omniscience is something we cannot fathom is not a relevant or valid definition.
1.1.17.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.2.
1.1.17.7. Pro: Classical theists, like other varieties of theist, hold that god is both all-powerful and all-knowing.  All knowing, by any reasonable standard, would include knowledge of the future. The only way this can be accomplished is via determinism. The problem is that an all-powerful entity has no limits to what it can do \(besides logical impossibilities\). But if the universe is deterministic, then god has no free will; he can't even really make decisions.
1.1.17.7.1. Con: It's possible that God has both made His decisions in advance, and is spontaneously capable of changing His mind and doing something else.
1.1.17.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.7.1.3.
1.1.17.7.3. Con: Omnipotence only implies determinism for a certain account of freedom, namely that for a being to be free it must be able, all other things being equal, to do otherwise. If the free action of the creature is posited as one of the effects of God's deeds, then the creature is not free in this sense. However this definition of freedom is rejected by many classical theists \(cf Thomas Aquinas for whom freedom arises from intellectual universality\) and therefore the argument does not follow.
1.1.17.7.4. Con: Even if the universe is deterministic, God, as creator of the universe, is immune from such determinism.
1.1.17.7.4.1. Pro: The creator must be capable of existing without the creation.
1.1.17.7.4.1.1. Pro: If an eternal God requires the existence of His creation, then He could not have existed without it to have created it. This would make the universe either God, or a part of God. This is the god of pantheism or panentheism, not the God of classical theism.
1.1.17.7.4.2. Pro: If the universe is deterministic, then it is the creator who made it so. Because God is immutable, it follows that once God decided \(determined\) what would happen in the universe, He would not change his mind. In short, it is possible that God freely chose to create a deterministic universe.
1.1.17.7.5. Con: There is no contradiction between all-knowing and all-powerful, unless you mistakenly assume that God is an entity inside of the universe. Classically, he has been conceived of as "outside" of the universe, including time itself. If God is outside of time, then his knowledge of the future does not imply strict determinism.
1.1.17.7.5.1. Pro: God is outside the Universe in the same way a computer programmer is "outside" his program. He can control and affect the program and can see the beginning and end parameters. If the computer program is "artificially intelligent," it can be said to have a measure of "free will," even if the parameters are limited and/or predetermined.
1.1.17.7.6. Con: If the universe unfolds at each step according to the will of God; then the future is knowable by God as it is determined according to God's free will.
1.1.18. Con: Most believers do not adhere to the classical definition of God as presented here - they modify it just a little bit, by introducing the problem of free will, or by using a more nuanced definition of omnipotence. This whole part of the discussion is to a large degree a strawman.
1.1.18.1. Con: The existence of a god which embodies omniscience, and the existence of free will are contradictory. If a god is omniscient then it must know the outcome of the all peoples lives and choices before they have occurred, which must mean that they are predetermined. Thus people would not have free will.
1.1.19. Con: Arguing definitions is not the same as arguing about what they are referring to, it only leads to a need to refine the definitions
1.1.19.1. Con: Refining the classical definition of God would amount to denying that God, as classically defined, exists.
1.2. Pro: There is empirical evidence supporting the existence of God.
1.2.1. Pro: Historical evidence supports the existence of God.
1.2.1.1. Pro: There is historical evidence that Jesus Christ existed, thus there is historical evidence that supports the existence of God.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.7.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Jesus Christ presented  extraordinary evidence of his deity by resurrecting from death, with both his death and subsequent life between witnessed by many people.

\(See [1 Corinthians 15:3-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A3-8&version=NIV)\)
1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.7.
1.2.1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.
1.2.1.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.1.2.4. Con: Jesus's resurrection may be a lie. It is not a proven fact but a testimony contained in one book.
1.2.1.1.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.1.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.2.
1.2.1.1.2.4.3. Con: There is extrabiblical evidence for the resurrection as well as the evidence of a movement based on that occurence which is still existing today.
1.2.1.1.2.5. Con: Resurrection stories and claims of witnesses are not uncommon at that time in history. Attis of Phrygia, Horus, Krishna, etc are other such figures.
1.2.1.1.2.5.1. Con: None of them was documented in script less than half a century after it happened and sparked a movement similar to 1st century Christianity.
1.2.1.1.2.6. Con: Even as recently as 2014 people have been [buried alive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_burial#Unintentional_live_burial) unintentionally. A lack of medical understanding is a more likely reason that led people to believe that Jesus Christ was dead, in turn leading to stories of resurrection.
1.2.1.1.2.6.1. Con: The Romans were expert executioners. It is highly unlikely that they would fail to successfully execute a condemned man.
1.2.1.1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Before Jesus was even put on the cross he had received beatings considered equivalent to execution.
1.2.1.1.2.6.1.2. Pro: Jesus was put up on the cross and stabbed in the side with a spear so he would bleed out to ensure he was dead by the time he was taken down from the cross.
1.2.1.1.2.6.1.2.1. Con: [Rasputin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Rasputin) was poisoned with enough cyanide to kill several men, and shot three times before he died. He was presumed dead after the first gunshot wound and left alone for some time, before leaping up and attacking his assailants when they returned. The only thing the crucifixion of Christ proves is that some people are more resilient than others.
1.2.1.1.2.6.1.3. Con: Something that is highly unlikely is not impossible. Even if the probability of surviving a Roman Crucifixion were .01%, and Jesus Christ was the only one to ever survive it, and everyone assumed he was dead because no one had ever survived an execution before, it is still possible that it played out exactly that way.
1.2.1.1.2.6.2. Con: Under normal conditions, one who had suffered a Roman Crucifixion and then lain in a tomb for days without medical care could not inspire others to believe they had conquered death.
1.2.1.1.2.6.2.1. Con: The Gospel of John records that Nicodemus brought myrrh and aloes \[John 19:39\]. These healing plants, particularly aloe plants, are considered medicinal and applied to wounds.
1.2.1.1.2.6.2.1.1. Con: While herbs and aloes are medicinal, even today's modern medicine is not advanced enough to restore a victim of a Roman scourging and crucifixion to full or near-full health in such a short amount of time.
1.2.1.1.2.6.2.1.1.1. Con: The tale could have been wildly exaggerated to accentuate suffering and other characteristics of the protagonist of the story and basic medical care given to Jesus \(being the herbs and aloes indicative of medical care\).
1.2.1.1.2.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con: "Could have been" implies what is possible, but possibility does not equal probability. We have documentation attesting to the severity of Roman scourging, the [brutality](http://www.newsweek.com/how-romans-used-crucifixion-including-jesus-political-weapon-318934) [of](http://www.newsweek.com/how-romans-used-crucifixion-including-jesus-political-weapon-318934) [crucifixion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1420788/), and the efficiency of the [Roman](https://stephenmillerbooks.com/2016/03/crucifixion-in-naked-gritty-detail/) death squads to successfully fulfill their assignment.

Without supporting evidence, this claim is pure speculation.
1.2.1.1.2.6.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The probability of someone being effectively dead for a couple days and then miraculously coming back to life is still vastly inferior to the account having been wildly exaggerated.
1.2.1.1.2.6.2.1.1.2. Con: We could never know this unless we subject various people to beatings and nail them on a cross for a few hours. The claim seems subjective.
1.2.1.1.2.6.2.1.1.3. Pro: Crucifixion and scourging resulted in massive tissue \(and even organ\) damage, blood loss, and physical trauma. Modern medicine is often unable to save victims from car accidents and other severe traumatic events resulting in injuries that appear less severe than this. And the ones that can be saved from comparable trauma are in no shape in three short days to appear "victorious over death" in any meaningful way.
1.2.1.1.2.6.2.1.2. Pro: The idea that medicinal plants cured Jesus is not more preposterous than the idea that Jesus died and then was miraculously alive again.
1.2.1.1.2.6.2.1.2.1. Con: This is true, only when assuming that Jesus rose by naturalistic means. This is not the Christian assertion. 

Christianity holds that the God who created the universe and all that is in it raised Jesus back to life. To ignore this is to beg the question of the discussion by asserting that God does not exist.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3. Con: The theory that Jesus was not dead fails to account for other aspects of the passion story.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1. Pro: The Swoon theory fails to explain how or why the stone was moved from the door of the tomb.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1. Pro: Moving such a stone would be impossible for a recently-crucified man.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.1. Pro: Jesus lost voluminous amounts of blood from the scourging, the crown of thorns \(which pierced the scalp, a part of the body that bleeds freely\), the crucifixion itself, and finally, the spear. 

In addition, he had already lost blood while praying in the garden. By the time he died, he would have suffered from massive dehydration.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.2. Pro: The Roman scourging alone often caused death. It caused deep lacerations, torn and bruised muscles.

While Jewish law called for no more than 39 lashes, Roman law had no such limit, and was continued until the commanding officer chose to end it.

For a victim of such a scourging to be able to remove the stone from the door of a tomb less than a week later, having received no medical attention, would take a miracle, almost on the same level as the resurrection.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Leveraging, it can move mountains \(or at least a ton-heavy blocks\). \(Exaggeration also does miracles for a story.\)
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.3. Pro: The wounds from the nails in a crucifixion victim's hands and feet would make it impossible to exert enough force to move a stone from the door of a tomb.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.4. Pro: The stones used to seal burial tombs in ancient Israel could weigh more than 1 ton.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.5. Con: It is more likely that someone else moved the stone to assist Jesus, than it is that he moved it himself.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.5.1. Con: We have no historical accounts of anyone either overpowering the posted guard, or asking/bribing them to move the stone.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.5.2. Con: The women would have been unable to move the stone.

16 Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, that they might come and anoint Him. 2 Very early in the morning, on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. 3 And they said among themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?”

[Mark 16:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16&version=NKJV)
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.5.3. Con: The posted guard, the Jewish leaders and the Romans had no incentive to remove the stone.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.5.3.1. Pro: The guard were posted to ensure that no one stole the body. Keeping the tomb sealed was the very reason they were there.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.5.3.2. Pro: The Jewish Leaders had requested that the guard be posted so that the disciples wouldn't steal the body and claim that Jesus had resurrected.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.5.3.3. Pro: The Romans had crucified Jesus, in part, because the Jewish leaders had proposed that he was calling himself a king, and was a threat to Caesar. The last thing they would have wanted was to allow a Jewish rabbi who called himself a king to also become known as someone that Rome could not kill... or at least someone that wouldn't stay dead!
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.5.4. Con: The disciples are unlikely to have moved the stone.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.5.4.1. Pro: They were hiding in fear for their lives. It is not likely that they became brave enough to challenge the posted guard.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.5.4.2. Pro: Had they helped the battered Jesus from the tomb, they would have known that the resurrection was a lie--a lie for which most of them were later tortured and killed.

Men will often die for what they believe to be true; but never for what they know to be false.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.5.4.3. Pro: The disciples could not have removed the stone without knowledge of the guard that was posted explicitly to keep the body of Jesus in the tomb.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.2. Con: The Bible itself fails to explain how the stone was moved, only that [it was moved](http://biblehub.com/john/20-1.htm).
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: By all accounts, Jesus left the tomb, whether he was helped or not, which means the stone must have been moved and the guards either abandoned their post, or their duty had been fulfilled.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.5.3.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.6.3.1.1.5.4.3.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.2. Pro: The Swoon theory fails to explain where Jesus \(or his body\) went. 

While the Jewish leaders did claim that the tomb was empty because the body had been stolen, we have no evidence at all that anyone ever searched for the body of the dead Jesus, or the living Jesus who somehow survived execution, despite having a huge number of ancient manuscripts that document the event.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.2.1. Con: On the contrary, [research](http://www.reviewofreligions.org/6115/tracing-the-post-crucifixion-footsteps-of-jesus-christas/) has been conducted on this very thing.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.2.2. Con: The original source of those manuscripts might be a false tale.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.2.2.1. Pro: A story can be made up \(example: I was on Mars just yesterday\).
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.2.2.2. Con: Skepticism is not evidence. It proves too much, as it can be applied to anything, including itself! This claim might itself be a false tale.

The manuscripts in question are historical documents, and should be evaluated vis-a-vis history, not simply assumed to be false.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.2.2.2.1. Con: Unjustified skepticism can be applied to anything, however it is perfectly justified and reasonable to be skeptical of something that is admittedly highly unlikely.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.2.2.2.2. Con: If evaluated as historical documents, the phenomena which a skeptical might outright dismiss as clear exaggeration or invention would indeed be dismissed as per standard criteria: historical inquiry is bound by background information that is [bona fide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith) accepted without any [ad hoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc) assumptions \([celsus.blog](https://celsus.blog/2014/06/25/history-and-the-paranormal/)\).
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.2.2.2.3. Con: Skepticism does not require evidence from the skeptic, it requires evidence from the one making the positive claim.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.3. Con: There is hardly a less likely and less reasonable explanation than a person being thoroughly killed and magically coming back to life.
1.2.1.1.2.6.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.6.2.1.2.1.
1.2.1.1.2.6.4. Pro: There have been [numerous examples](http://www.cracked.com/article_20973_5-real-people-who-were-mistakenly-declared-dead.html) of people being in situations which were believed to cause there death, but in actuality did not.
1.2.1.1.3. Con: The idea that "God has made himself known by entering into the world as the person Jesus Christ" is an [unfalsifiable](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/178/Unfalsifiability) claim.
1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: The existence of Jesus and the truth of some of his miracle claims are historical claims, and as such can be falsified.
1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Jesus's resurrection is evidence for an external power that raised him. It seems most likely that that external power would be a theistic God, as he himself claimed.
1.2.1.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.1.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.
1.2.1.1.3.1.4. Con: The Bible is not a historical record. It is no more evidence for Jesus than Marvel comics are for the existence of Spiderman.
1.2.1.1.3.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.
1.2.1.1.3.1.4.2. Con: To my knowledge, all Marvel authors claim Spiderman to be fiction.  In Contrast, authors of the New Testament cannon writing about Jesus claim him to be nonfictional. Therefore New Testament authors at least should be regarded as "witnesses" to Jesus as nonfiction.  Marvel authors would be regarded as "witnesses" to Spiderman as fiction.
1.2.1.1.3.1.5. Con: The fact that someone made the claims can be falsified, the truth of the claims cannot.
1.2.1.1.3.1.5.1. Con: It's not clear why these particular historical events can't be investigated historically in the same way as the rest of the past.
1.2.1.1.3.1.5.1.1. Con: Whether the man Jesus existed can be ascertained with a sufficient degree of certainty. Whether he was the son of God and performed miracles, and there are many historical accounts of miracles that were never proven, is another issue.
1.2.1.1.3.1.6. Con: The existence of a man who claimed to be the son of god, and the fact that god sent the earth himself in the form of his son, are two distinct claims, with drastically different [standards of evidence.](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Extraordinary_claims_require_extraordinary_evidence)
1.2.1.1.3.1.7. Con: Just because someone witnessed something they did not understand at the time of it happening and declaring it a miracle, does not constitute prove that it really happened.
1.2.1.1.3.1.7.1. Pro: Eyewitness accounts are incredibly unreliable. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewitness_testimony) [2](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/) [3](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/eyewitnesses-arent-as-reliable-as-you-might-think/2015/01/30/fe1bc26c-7a74-11e4-9a27-6fdbc612bff8_story.html)
1.2.1.1.3.1.7.2. Con: Alternative attempts to explain the accounts of miracles and the resurrection of Jesus are unsatisfactory to this day.
1.2.1.1.3.2. Con: The Bible itself gives the conditions for falsifying the claims of Christ in 1 Cor 15:12-19.  If Jesus did not rise from the dead, Christianity is false.

"17 Unless Christ was raised to life, your faith is useless, and you are still living in your sins. 18 And those people who died after putting their faith in him are completely lost. 19 If our hope in Christ is good only for this life, we are worse off than anyone else." \(CEV\) [Read this passage on BibleHub.](http://biblehub.com/cev/1_corinthians/15.htm)

1.2.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.
1.2.1.1.6. Con: Unfortunately a vast number of beliefs in the world might fail to see it this way, and there has never been a way to disprove one religion over another. So your statement is speculative.
1.2.1.1.7. Con: Because this claim must be taken on faith, it is likely to lead to an incorrect conclusion.
1.2.1.1.7.1. Con: Jesus' deity must not be taken solely on faith. There is evidence of the deity of Jesus.

1.2.1.1.7.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.
1.2.1.1.7.1.3. Pro: Jesus performed miracles and taught that they evidenced his divinity.

1.2.1.1.7.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.7.
1.2.1.1.7.1.3.2. Con: There are no sources outside the Bible to prove this claim.
1.2.1.1.7.1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.2.
1.2.1.1.7.1.3.2.2. Con: There are non-biblical sources that refer to Jesus' miracles
Josephus \(37-101AD\): "he was a worker of amazing deeds"

Celsus \(175AD\): "he acquired certain \(magical\) powers"

See [this article](http://coldcasechristianity.com/2014/is-there-any-evidence-for-jesus-outside-the-bible/) that describes what can be learned about Jesus from non-biblical sources.
1.2.1.1.7.1.3.3. Con: Jesus might have been a sorceror whose magics appeared divine but were not actual miracles.
1.2.1.1.7.1.3.4. Con: Performing miracles is not the same as being omnipotent.
1.2.1.1.7.1.3.5. Con: Jesus did not claim that His miracles proved His deity, but that they proved he was the Son sent by the Father.
1.2.1.1.7.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.7.1.3.2.2.
1.2.1.1.8. Pro: There is more historical evidence that Jesus existed than of many other men who existed before the printing press. This same Jesus professed to be God.
1.2.1.1.8.1. Con: We have documentation of the existence of Jim Jones, who almost 1000 people professed to be God, but clearly the existence of Jim Jones is not evidence of the existence of God.
1.2.1.1.8.1.1. Con: Because one person's claim is a lie does not have any bearing on another's claim. This statement neither supports nor undermines the parent claim.
1.2.1.1.8.2. Con: Outside of the bible there are only two references \(josephous and tacitus\) both of which have been shown to be forgeries.
1.2.1.1.8.2.1. Con: [This is factually incorrect.](http://www.rationalchristianity.net/jesus_extrabib.html)
1.2.1.1.9. Con: Jeremiah 31 establishes others won't die for your sins. "But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge." This is confirmed by Ezekiel 18:4 "The soul who sins will die." Jesus could not die for the sins of others according to God.
1.2.1.1.9.1. Pro: This is further clarified in Ezekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself."
1.2.1.1.10. Con: Jesus Christ's existence in history is not evidence that a god exists. i.e.: If a woman bears a child, she can claim the father to be whomever she wants, that claim has no bearing on the actual father.
1.2.1.1.11. Con: Jesus Christ did exist, but there was a council \(The [First Council of Nicaea](https://www.livescience.com/2410-council-nicea-changed-world.html), in 325AD\) that decided on whether Jesus would be portrayed as human or divine \(was concluded as divine\). Therefore the existence of Jesus provides no direct proof of the existence of God.
1.2.1.1.12. Con: There is no evidence that Jesus Christ was a god.
1.2.1.1.12.1. Pro: Jesus is not a theistic god in the classical meaning of the word.
1.2.1.1.12.1.1. Con: Many Christians are classical theists, and they believe that Jesus is, in a nuanced way, a theistic God in this sense.
1.2.1.1.12.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.1.2.
1.2.1.1.12.3. Con: Jesus claimed to be God, and others agreed. Testimony is evidence.
1.2.1.1.12.3.1. Con: Many human beings with followers who enthusiastically agree have claimed to be a god. There's no clear reason to accept Jesus's divinity but reject the others.
1.2.1.1.12.3.1.1. Con: Considering the unique impact of the person of Jesus Christ in history there is absolute reason to consider him as entirely different from any other.
1.2.1.1.12.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.7.1.3.
1.2.1.1.12.5. Pro: Many people throughout history have claimed to be prophets, messiahs, gods, or otherwise, or been labeled so by others, but this does not make such claims true, regardless of the amount of people who believe it.
1.2.1.1.13. Pro: Jesus' disciples, who were witness to his life and miracles, identified him as being the Son of God. \(See Matthew 16 verses 13-17\)
1.2.1.1.13.1. Con: Nothing of Jesus' life that was written about him during his alleged lifetime has survived to this day.
1.2.1.1.13.2. Con: The disciples never wrote their own accounts of their experience of Jesus. The earliest copies of the books we now call the Gospels date to decades after the occurance of the proported events, and were not authored by the men whose names they are title after.
1.2.1.1.13.3. Con: Rather then reports of witnesses, what is provided is hearsay in the form of posthumously written texts.
1.2.1.1.13.4. Con: This testimony is only of a man performing some kind of miracles. There are [many examples](https://theconversation.com/tricking-the-brain-how-magic-works-56451) of miracles and other forms of magic being faked throughout history.
1.2.1.1.13.4.1. Pro: People today fake divine power and deeds on YouTube and Christian television shows.
1.2.1.1.13.4.1.1. Pro: Some [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqPc9btW1rM) have shown how fake healing shows generate illusory miracles.
1.2.1.1.13.4.2. Pro: Even in the information age, people people are still deceived by rather obvious and well known gimmicks \(for instance the [leg extention](https://youtube.com/watch?v=wW2IgE78qzQ) "miracles", which are [not miraculous](https://youtube.com/watch?v=wW2IgE78qzQ) at all\).
1.2.1.1.13.4.3. Pro: Even in cases where faking miracles is not intentional, a person's actions can be exaggerated and distorted by those who tell and retell the episode.
1.2.1.1.14. Con: Ultimately the role of God being fulfilled by Jesus doesn't even exist in the Bible and came about as a result of a conflict between the different sects of Christianity in ancient Rome.
1.2.1.1.14.1. Con: The Bible identifies Jesus as God. See [Hebrews 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+1%3A3&version=NIV), [Hebrews 1:6-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+1%3A6-9&version=NIV), John 14:8-11.
1.2.1.1.14.2. Con: The Bible identifies Jesus as being present and involved in the creation of the universe. See [Colossians 1:16–17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1%3A16%E2%80%9317&version=NIV), [John 1:1-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+1%3A1-5&version=ESV).
1.2.1.1.14.3. Con: The Bible identifies Jesus as having authority to forgive sins, while also qualifying that God forgives sins. See [Mark 2:1-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+2%3A1-12&version=NIV),  [Luke 7:47–50](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+7%3A47%E2%80%9350&version=NIV)
1.2.1.1.14.4. Con: The Bible identifies Jesus as being the judge of the living and dead. See [John 5:26-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+5%3A26-27&version=NIV), [Matthew 25:31-46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:31-46).
1.2.1.1.14.5. Con: There is no historical evidence that intrachristian conflict in Rome actually led to a perversion of what the first Christians and their Scriptural authors believed.
1.2.1.1.14.5.1. Pro: [Christians believed in the Trinity prior to the Council of Nicaea](https://historyforatheists.com/2017/05/the-great-myths-4-constantine-nicaea-and-the-bible/).
1.2.1.1.14.5.1.1. Pro: In John 8:48-59, Jesus tells the Pharisees, "Before Abraham was, I AM". \(v58\)  "I AM" is a reference to the name of God given to Moses at the burning bush. The Pharisees knew exactly what he was saying, for in verse 59, they take up stones to stone him for blasphemy. John included this affirmation that Jesus was God long before Nicaea.
1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.
1.2.1.3. Con: Historical and anecdotal evidence are both highly susceptible to bias, manipulation, tampering, accidental or purposeful translation errors, etc. This invalidates it for use in proving the existence of God.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: The Torah was originally written in Sanskrit and not in Hebrew. The God of the Torah does not exist because the Hebrew word for God is a mistranslation of Sanskrit words meaning the Lunar Dynasty of ancient India. [See David's Note](https://www.facebook.com/DavidWLundman/posts/1901710463426158)
1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Even if the Hebrew word for God is a mistranslation, it does nothing to prove that the Abrahamic God does not exist.
1.2.1.3.1.2. Con: There are religions other than those descended from Judaism that believe in the God of classical theism.
1.2.1.3.1.3. Con: Belief in the Torah, or in any particular religion, is not necessary for belief in a classical theistic God.
1.2.1.3.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.7.
1.2.1.3.1.5. Con: The view that the Torah was written in Sanskit is not a commonly accepted view, or at least not universal or conclusive enough to disregard the evidence it provides.
1.2.1.3.1.6. Con: Some parts of the Torah can be confirmed to be written in periods and cultures where Sanskrit would not have been written.
1.2.1.3.1.7. Con: Regardless of the supposed origin of a particular name, the actions described by the entity represented by it clearly represents traits which would qualify it as a classical theistic God.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: Universally ignoring historical and anecdotal evidence would imply an inability to learn anything from either history or eyewitness testimony.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: Being skeptical about historical and anecdotal evidence is not the same as ignoring it. From historical evidence of religious ideas we have learned much about culture, politics, and psychology.
1.2.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Historical evidence has a hard limit: scientific plausibility. When a story is based on a person with the ability to perform 'miracles', routinely counteracting well established laws of nature at will, this fact alone gravely demotes the historical value of the said story and turns it from historical source to a tale that, at best, may contain some grain of history in it, if we are lucky enough.
1.2.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: When the person is just any ordinary human, this may hold true. However, the stories of Jesus are written in a religious context where one might logically expect God to confirm His approval of the message with miracles.

To reject these claims out of hand is nothing more than an anti-supernatural bias. As the question before us is directly related to the claim "does God/the supernatural exist", we cannot simply dismiss such claims without begging the question. They must be critically evaluated.
1.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.6.1.
1.2.1.3.2.3. Con: There is a difference between:  \(1\) Being negative and saying no to everything, \(not science\), \(2\) being skeptical towards everything but accepting the scientific method \(repeated experiment and application of logic\) and \(3\) being skeptical of stories that involve : \(a\) counterexamples to the laws of physics commited by: \(b\) people whose historical existence has not been scientifically accepted without a great room for debate. That last part \(3\) is not even science, it is basic common sense.
1.2.1.3.3. Con: All evidence is susceptible to bias and manipulation, since it must be interpreted by humans. Scientific methods reduce but do not eliminate bias and manipulation. Historical and anecdotal evidence can be validated as proofs using scientific methods such as textual criticism, archeology and forensic psychology.
1.2.1.3.3.1. Con: This claim invalidates the point it tries to support. There is no forensic evidence supporting specific claims in many religions - Christianity included - and in a few cases, there is no historical consensus for the very existence of some of the [prophets](https://theconversation.com/weighing-up-the-evidence-for-the-historical-jesus-35319).
1.2.1.4. Con: Historical evidence for the existence of God is in the form of numerous stories and texts. While such things are important they should not be the basis of an argument and should only exist to support other evidence.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: Historical evidence in the form of stories gains weight through context.

E.g. anyone can author a story about miracles - however it is highly significant that the original witnesses to Jesus' miracles and resurrection \(and who would know their truth or falsity beyond doubt\) were willing to be executed \(and were executed\) for their testamony.
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Stories about God\(s\) are not evidence for God\(s\) any more than Star Trek is evidence for the existence of Spock.
1.2.1.4.3. Pro: There only exists folkloric stories about the claims of men thousands of years ago, pertaining to God and his plans for us. 

Such claims, being made today about new gods, by men claiming to know their will, or to have been sent by such gods would have more credibility given that we can at least confirm they were made first hand.
1.2.1.4.3.1. Con: Any claim about God interacting with man, whether ancient or modern, must be confirmed with valid evidence. For example, Christianity holds that Jesus validated his claims by literally and historically dying by crucifixion, and then rising from the dead three days later... something impossible for anyone other than deity.
1.2.1.4.3.2. Con: Confirming that a claim is made first hand does not ensure the validity of the claim. Therefore, this does not automatically grant them more credibility.
1.2.1.4.4. Con: The majority of history is only supported by texts and claims. We should inspect the likelihood of claims and how well they fit with existing data using historical methodology, rather than dismissing anything without physical evidence outright.
1.2.1.5. Con: There exists a wide-ranging human tendency to tell fictitious stories and build grand mythologies without the conveying of literal fact being the only consideration or intention.
1.2.1.6. Con: [Anthropological and historical evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_origin_of_religions) shows religion appeared and evolved and was not revealed by a higher power.
1.2.1.6.1. Con: Man's ability to create religion cannot be thought of as proof that God did not manifest himself first.
1.2.1.6.2. Con: Increased complexity found in archaeology could suggest simply that as memory of the initial manifestation of God grew dimmer that man made religion more complex to preserve the memory.
1.2.1.7. Con: God is the catch-all hypothesis that allowed rationality to take hold in primitive eras, when no alternative model was available \(why is there thunder? because the sky God is angry\). As time went by and knowledge grew, religion was replaced by philosophy, then by science. In other words, God is a necessary cognitive step in the genealogy of knowledge.
1.2.2. Pro: There are scientific reasons to believe that God exists.
1.2.2.1. Pro: There is paleontogical evidence that God exists. Phyla appear in [large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion#Uniqueness_of_the_explosion) out of nowhere and decrease in numbers as time goes by. While there are a small number of historical periods when phyla emerged, there are no fossils that support the alternative evolutionary hypothesis of gradual change.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: The evolution of Phyla can support theories that are incompatible with God's existence, then it does not support the existence of God.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: The absence of fossils does not prove the absence of ancient living beings gradually evolving. Their fossils may have been destroyed by natural catastrophes.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: The Cambrian period lasted 53 million years, so is hardly 'out of nowhere'. 
To give  an intuitive sense of how long this is, if the Cambrian explosion was as long as  a 100m athletics track, then for comparison Homo sapiens first emerged as a species 40-50cm away, and Jesus was born 4mm away \(less than the thickness of Usain Bolt's running shoe sole\).
1.2.2.2. Pro: Some of the [earliest and greatest scientists](https://www.famousscientists.org/25-famous-scientists-who-believed-in-god/) pursued their work because they believed that the universe was created by a rational mind, and could be interpreted by a rational mind.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: The scientists didn't believe for scientific reasons
1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Many, such as Antony Flew, were convinced by scientific evidence such as the fine-tuning of the universe for life.
1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con: To believe that universe is fine-tuned for life is a fallacy we commit as beings which exist in this universe.
1.2.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: What we see as fine-tuned is the only possible state for the universe to exist in a way that would lead to this very moment. It is not that Earth has miraculously been given atmosphere containing oxygen that we, conveniently, use to survive. We use oxygen because that's what we evolved to breathe because of how the universe turned out to be.
1.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: The scientists did not provide a valid scientific work proving the existence of God. I.e. a work with, at least, hypotheses, methods and results that respect scientific criteria of reproducibility and refutability.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Empirical \(or scientific\) proofs presuppose purely material phenomena, which, given that God is immaterial, means that there could never, even in principle, be a purely empirical proof of the existence of God.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: If God is pure actuality, then he cannot be material \(physical\), for matter always and necessarily contains an admixture of potentiality.

\(In fact, traditional Aristotelian understanding of matter is that it is pure potentiality, but agreement with this idea is not necessary for the statement about God to be true.\)
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Empirical proofs can be used if the immaterial entity interacts with a material entity. If a god is interacting with this world, we should be able to measure it with empirical methods.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: The concept of divine intervention assumes that the world runs or could run by itself, but classical theism denies this, instead holding that God not only created everything, but sustains everything in being from moment to moment.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3. Pro: The God claim and any possible proof of it is metaphysical therefore it may never be proven by experimentation, fixing it outside the knowable. This means that to believe in God one will always have to make a very large series of assumptions, which leaves the believer open to a wealth of inaccuracies. To not believe must be the default.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Science is not the only source of human knowledge. Indeed “science is the only source of knowledge” is not a scientific claim and therefore undermines itself.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Science is not a source of knowledge, it is simply one way to structure and interpret the information before our senses.  Knowledge can be accumulated from data that we collect, and we can use science to analyze the data.  Yes, there are non-scientific methods of data analysis, but those methods have not been proven effective.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2. Con: It is an error to presume that only that which is measurable can be shown to exist. The abstract number "1" exists. Yet we cannot measure the number 1 itself. Thus, although we may not have a way to measure a god, it does not necessarily follow that there is no reason to believe a god exists.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: 1 is a measurement. It does not require measurement. God is not a measurement and therefore should be measurable.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: The concept of "1" is used to comprehend measurements. The concept exists. But the concept itself cannot be measured.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Measurements are standardized. A god is not.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The classical definition of God is fairly standardized.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.1.1.2. Con: 1 can be defined as "a singular". Singulars exist. The term "1" is therefore measurable and testable.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Time can't be precisely measured in terms of gods.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.1.3. Pro: Morality can't be precisely measured in terms of gods.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.1.4. Pro: Knowledge can't be precisely measured in terms of gods.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.1.5. Pro: Power can't be precisely measured in terms of gods.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.1.1.1.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.1.7. Con: [Qualia](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Qualia) are another existing feature of reality that cannot be measured.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.2. Con: The number 1 has been tested. A god's existence has not been tested.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.2.1. Con: No physical test can be created to prove the existence of an abstract entity. The number 1 has not been empirically shown to exist in its own right. It can be logically demonstrated to exist, though.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.1.1.2.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.1.1.2.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.1.7.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.3. Con: Metaphysical means neither "beyond experimentation" nor "outside the knowable". It means beyond sensual. Senses are the common platform on which science is founded. This only means that objectivity of metaphysical cannot be verified by senses. But in religion there are also experiments, knowledge and the sharing of knowledge. Difference is in spiritual knowledge being subjective and beyond senses. Not a series,but a single assumption on "where all this came from" or "what is my purpose" will do.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.4. Con: God does not have to be material in order to be empirically proven/disproven.    If there is a claim that god can affect the material world in a measurable way, then the scientific method can be used to test that theory.   For example, the claim that "prayer works" is something that can, and has been tested and shown to be empirically incorrect.

[Harvard research on prayer](http://freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/Harvard_prayer_experiment)
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.5. Con: If we assume that there can never be empirical proof \(what other kind of proof is there?\) of God's existence, then we assume that he cannot be proven to exist. Likewise, we assume he cannot be proven to not exist, rendering all arguments, including the origin argument of "God Exists" to be un-provable, thereby making this entire web of arguments pointless, and enforcing the concept of God as a belief system which people can take or leave based on personal preference.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.5.1. Con: "What other kind of proof is there?"

The same kind of proof that "proves" that empirical evidence is a valid method for finding truth. You cannot prove this scientifically; it is a philosophical claim.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1.6. Con: We do see the effects of God interacting with this world. For example, research shows that religion helps people better cope with [life stresses](https://www.cmu.edu/qolt/Publications/2009Pubs/JPM-Hebert-2009.pdf). If God exists, then interaction with Him would have an expected positive impact, like [these](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508619.2014.952588) [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15895540?dopt=Abstract) [show](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/1075553041323803). The problem is not "do we see evidence of God interacting", but "do we attribute what evidence we're seeing to God, or to some other causal mechanism."
1.2.2.2.1.2.2. Con: Science is not the only way to determine truth.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Scientific evidence does not reveal all truth. Neither is there demonstrable scientific proof for mathematical claims \(such as 2+2=4\), relation/personal claims, \(such as "John loves Mary"\), or historical claims \(such as George Washington was President of the United States\). Never-the-less, we work out methods for ascertaining their truth value.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: If I have two\(2\) apples, then I collect two more\(+2\) apples without losing my first two apples, I now have 4\(=4\) apples. I can demonstrate this through experimentation, and each time reach the same result, therefore it is scientifically provable.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Considering that the feeling of love can be broken down to a chemical reaction that can be measured, is testable and observable, claims like John loves Mary can be proven.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.3. Con: We don't simply accept that Washington was the first president of the US because it was a story passed down through generations, but because it was well documented and observed.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: The more out of the ordinary a claim is the stronger the evidence required to convince a reasonable person. Washington being the first president of the United States is comparatively a lot less extraordinary than a miracle.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.4. Pro: Scientific evidence does not reveal all truth. There are however other methods, like inference.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.4.1. Con: Inference is a way to establish a theory of what might be possible based on logic. This is the start of the scientific process. That theory is then tested, which leads to revealing the truth, whether that truth coincides with the original theory or not.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Inference here means: the process of deriving the strict logical consequences of assumed premises. This process does not require scientific testing.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Or in other words: "A theory of what might be possible based on logic."
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Logical deduction allows for proof of self-consistency - a truth that is not derivable scientifically and which is not in the real of the possible, but in the realm of the actual.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.4.1.2. Con: Inference is not necessarily used in the context of scientific methodology.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2. Con: This contradicts the very definition of science: the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment. There exists no other way to determine anything than by the above outlined processes.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1. Con: This rests on a reductionist presupposition that everything to be determined is observable in the physical and natural world, begging the question against transcendence.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: Trascendence and trascendental arguments about non mundane nor verifiable concepts bring to not measurable hypothesis, nor reliable ones, therefore it cannot be verified, if it cannot be verified is not scientific, if is not scientific it cannot be use against a scientifically and empirically proven statement.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Something that is known \(for instance from deduction\) can very well be used against something scientific and empirically induced.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Something that is deduced must still be tested before being accepted as truth, which is scientific.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The truth of the premise\(s\) and the use of prescriptive rules that guarantee the validity of the deductive process is sufficient to guarantee the truth of the conclusion, irrespective of any tests of the conclusion.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.2. Con: Science does not presuppose that everything must be observable. Dark matter and dark energy are prime examples of "things" that are not observable but are still scientific.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.1. Con: The concept of dark energy arose from [empirical observations](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy), largely relating to the expansion and shape of the Universe. We do not know what it is, and we cannot observe it, but we have observed its impact upon the Universe.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.1. Con: While it is [inferred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference) from empirical observations, it is itself never [observed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation). Like God, for all intents and purposes and as far as it is known, dark energy is both immaterial and is immune to observation.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Dark energy / dark matter is not totally immune to observation if we can see the physical effects it has on other things. On the other hand, the effects of God on the physical world are more conjecture than pure evidence.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Like dark energy, God, [in accordance to classical theism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism), should be inferrable from its effects on empirically testable phenomena.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Dark energy / Dark matter are still in the theory testing and evidence collecting stage of the scientific process. If God, like dark energy, has an effect on the world yet cannot be observed, then it stands to reason that God falls into the same category: a theory that still needs testing to be proven true.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: The hypothesis of dark matter/energy has ample confirmation, while the hypothesis of God has ample disconfirmation.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.2. Con: As a study of the material world, science does properly presuppose [methodological naturalism](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Methodological_naturalism). Scientists do not \(and should not\) routinely appeal to the supernatural when searching for causes.

This is not to say that philosophical naturalism is necessarily true, or that scientists must or should be philosophical naturalists when evaluating the results of their experiments.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Rather than naturalism being a presupposition, it is a consequence of the study of the real \(as anything that is found to be real is consequently natural\). An appeal to the supernatural is therefore at most an appeal to ignorance, which is both fallacious and unscientific.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: "Methodological naturalism is the label for the *required assumption* of philosophical naturalism when working with the scientific method. Methodological naturalists limit their scientific research to the study of natural causes....\[S\]cientists assume that all causes are empirical and naturalistic; which means they can be measured, quantified and studied methodically." From the [definition](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Methodological_naturalism) on RationalWiki, emphasis added.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.3. Con: Dark matter may itself not be observable but the evidence for dark matter [derives](https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/five-reasons-we-think-dark-matter-exists-a122bd606ba8) from its observable impact upon the universe.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.2. Con: Scientific evidence is generated by testing hypotheses in or making observations about the world. That "science is the only way of identifying truth" is neither a testable hypothesis nor an observable characteristic. Thus this claim fails its own standard of proof.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: Science is not scientism. Science does not assume or imply that there is no other way to determine anything.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.3. Con: This philosophical claim cannot meet its own standard of truth.

If the only truth is that which can be proven by science, then this statement, that cannot be proven true scientifically, cannot possibly be true.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.2.1.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.3. Con: But it is one of the best ways to determine truth.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.4. Con: Science has consistently shown much higher reliability than revelation or extrasensory perception.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.4.1. Con: This is a straw-man argument. The parent makes no assertions regarding revelation or ESP.
1.2.2.2.1.2.2.5. Con: Revelation or extrasensory perception have shown no better reliability than just guessing.
1.2.2.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.2.2.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: There are also quite a few [great minds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_atheists_in_science_and_technology) that are or were atheists.
1.2.2.2.3. Con: Many of the scientists, such as Albert Einstein, did not, in fact, believe in a Biblical god. This is something that is often misunderstood, as deism is not the same as theism. The subtle belief in a greater power is not synonymous with a personal God, as in Abrahamic religions.
1.2.2.2.3.1. Con: The idea of God at issue in this discussion is not the personal God of Abrahamic religion, but simply the idea of an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent creator - a belief that is arguably compatible with deism as well as theism.
1.2.2.2.4. Con: Appealling to intelligent individuals as an argument is a logical fallacy known as an [appeal to authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority).
1.2.2.2.4.1. Con: Saying that an argument is valid because an intelligent individual makes it is a logical fallacy. Citing an argument made by an intelligent individual is not.
1.2.2.3. Pro: The concept of God offers few evolutionary benefits and is therefore unlikely to have arisen from a universe without God.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: The concept of batman offers few obvious evolutionary benefits, and is therefore unlikely to have arisen from a universe without a batman. Very few people would argue this means Batman must exist.
1.2.2.3.1.1. Con: Belief in God is [intrinsic to human psychology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ii-bsrHB0o&t=258s) and fundamentally instinctual, implying a genetic/structural component.
1.2.2.3.1.2. Con: There is no reason to believe that the character of Batman would be unlikely to exist in a universe where the person doesn't already exist.
1.2.2.3.1.3. Con: Very few people believe that Batman is a real person rather than a fictional character, and so that belief has little to do with adaptation and survival.
1.2.2.3.1.3.1. Con: It could easily be the case that in the past, God was a purely fictitious character.
1.2.2.3.2. Con: The concept of god is not genetic so it would not be affected directly by evolution.
1.2.2.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.1.
1.2.2.3.2.2. Con: Evolution can and often appears to work in very indirect ways. This is why evolutionists make the distinction between  genotype, phenotype and extended phenotype.
1.2.2.3.3. Con: There is good evolutionary benefit from assumption of a false positive. Belief in God can be attributed to the evolutionary mechanism, [Agenticity,](https://michaelshermer.com/2009/06/agenticity/) that leads to people assuming there is a god who may punish them if they don't behave. This explains why a belief in a god would evolve as a defence mechanism regardless of whether or not there is actually a god.
1.2.2.3.4. Con: It is reasonable to assume that early humans would have sought to understand the mechanics of the world around them. Prior to a scientific worldview, a god who was orchestrating things would have been an understandable conclusion for them to draw.
1.2.2.3.5. Con: Many religious groups fiercely dispute that belief has no benefit. There's a popular notion of "Placebo God" in which God is seen as a beneficial idea even if untrue.
1.2.2.3.6. Con: Earliest god figures were that of the sun, moon, stars, and animals known as [animism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism). As a way to bring order to society and people wanting to gain power over others, feigning communion with the gods or spirits would achieve this. This would provide an evolutionary societal benefit. Insisting laws be divinely mandated could keep people from killing each other and provide for a better primitive society, creating early stability, and benefiting those who believed.
1.2.2.3.7. Con: There are several evolutionary advantages of a shared belief or religion. 

A commonly cited one is that shared beliefs allow communities of \>150 people to trust strangers thus promoting greater exchange of goods and ideas and thereby promoting survival odds of those [sharing](http://www.rationaloptimist.com/) the [belief](http://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/).
1.2.2.3.8. Con: God does not exist because God’s existence is irrelevant to human progression, therefore negating any purpose to our creation.
1.2.2.3.8.1. Con: God's relevance in human life and development does not affect his existence.
1.2.2.3.8.2. Con: "Human progression" \(especially technological progression\) does not determine human purpose.
1.2.2.3.8.3. Con: Since all major technical innovations in the last millenium have originated a heavily theistic societies, often being performed by ardent believers, it would seem that God's existence is not irrelevant to human progression.
1.2.2.3.8.4. Con: God could have a purpose in creating humanity.
1.2.2.3.8.5. Pro: Increasingly we are looking for meaning and purpose from our own hearts than from a divine being. Increasingly God is becoming more and more irrelevant to determine human meaning and purpose.
1.2.2.3.8.5.1. Con: What men seek, and from where, has no relevance to the question of God's existence. Whether men fail to consider God has no impact on his existence.
1.2.2.4. Con: Some evidence can be found to support virtually any hypothesis, including the existence of God. However, truth must accurately describe and predict all the data.

The hypothesis "there is no god" accurately fits all of the available data, whereas "God exists" does not fit all of the available data.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: The conclusion "God exists" does not obviously conflict with any available data. The arguments to the contrary are primarily arguments of why we should not accept it, rather than claims that it could not be true.
1.2.2.4.1.1. Con: The conclusion "God does not exist" does not obviously conflict with any available data. The arguments to the contrary are primarily argument of why we should not accept it rather then claims that it could not be true.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1. Con: Many of the arguments for God's existence are deductive, meaning that \(if sound\) they do prove conclusively that God's nonexistence is impossible.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Ontological arguments](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-arguments/) support the existence of God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Multiverse theory logically concludes with a supreme God. If all logically possible things are real, and it is logically possible to have a God over all the multiverse, then at least one multiverse contains the real God of the multiverse.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: For god to have any effect on a multiverse, it needs to be in that multiverse as well. Claiming that some multiverse contains a god does not suggest that this multiverse contains a god.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: God is a necessary being. Necessary beings cannot fail to exist in any possible world. Therefore, if there is a universe in which God exists, then God exists in all possible universes.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: If there are multiple possible universes, that does not imply that there are also multiple possible multiverses or that universes within a multiverse can interact in a way that supports a god of a multiverse.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: If all possible universes exist, there is no reason to assume, that universes can't interact with each other. [Theoretical models indicate](http://bigthink.com/scotty-hendricks/a-new-hypothesis-suggests-that-parallel-universes-might-interact-after-all) that it's mathematically possible and therefore should exist.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: If there are universes in which God exists, there are universes in which God does not exist. It is impossible to know for sure which kind of universe we are in, and therefore this argument cannot be used to prove that there is a god in our universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: If all logically possible universes exist, all logically possible Gods exist. If all logically possible Gods exist, at least one of these gods would possess all the traits of the God of Classical theism, including existing in all universes.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.2. Con: God does not exist inside of the universe, but is transcendent to it. Therefore the conditions inside of any universe are not relevant to the question.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.4. Con: This is a non-sequitur. Just because God exists in some universes, it does not follow that he does not exist in some universes.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Classical theism traditionally involves the claim that God is necessary, which in modal language means existing in every possible world.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Ontological arguments go one step further than asserting the existence of something, and assert a relationship between that thing and something else. They are not an argument for any being's existence, rather an additional, equally unsupported claim about what that being might do in their spare time.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: None of the ontological arguments rely on or conclude with any action taken by God, or any relationship God has with a specific thing.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Any ontological argument offered in support of this claim, and this [god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism), are being used in support of a number of assertions, not just about the existence of something, but its nature and its habits. This is a major distinction between [deism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism) and classical theism.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Since some of the properties of a classical God are met, this argument can be considered to constitute evidence for classical theism.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: It is more parsimonious to assume that the God argued for in the ontological arguments is the same God concluded by the cosmological and teleological arguments. Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that the God of the ontological arguments did create the universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Kant provided a refutation of ontological arguments.[Of the Impossibility of an Ontological Proof](http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/Phil383/kant.htm)
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Kant's objection doesn't apply to Plantinga's modal ontological argument  since that version of the argument doesn’t assume that existence is a property or perfection. See [Questions on existence and certainty](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/media/reasonable-faith-podcast/questions-on-existence-and-certainty/) and [Kant’s Critique of the Traditional Arguments for the Existence of God](http://reasonablefaithadelaide.org.au/kants-critique-of-the-traditional-arguments-for-the-existence-of-god/)
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: [A condensed version of Plantinga's argument](https://www.kialo.com/the-existence-of-god-2629/2629.0=2629.1+2629.4418+2629.970+2629.1353-2629.7408)
It is implicitly assumed that the being defined by \(1\) is real.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: This is how ontological arguments go:
\(1\) \(Partially\) define God as having certain properties.
\(2\) Use these properties and certain assumptions.
\(3\) Arrive at the conclusion that God as defined by \(1\) exists.
However \(3\) is not the conclusion that God exists in the actual world. A hidden assumption in the argument all along is that God defined by \(1\) exists. Therefore the conclusion is the mere tautology: if God exists, then God exists.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.3.3. Con: Kant believed that we needed an intuition from the object to give us knowledge of existence, which the concept alone could never give. His claim that existence is not a property is based on his model of perception and experience, which is problematic in a number of ways and not widely accepted by philosophers in the present day.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: [St. Anselm](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-arguments/#StAnsOntArg) made an ontological argument for the existence of God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Aquinas [rejected](https://www.iep.utm.edu/ont-arg/#SH2c) Anselm’s ontological argument. He held that God’s existence is “self-evident in itself” but not “self-evident to us”.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.2. Con: The argument assumes classical Greek notions of causation; which are demonstrably false.  It has never been the case that a single cause has led to a single effect, and it is always the fact that multiple causes lead to multiple effects.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3. Pro: Anselm's argument: 
1. \(Definition\) God is that than which nothing greater can be imagined.
2. \(Assumption, for reductio\) Suppose God does not exist.
3. \(Premise\) To exist is greater than not to exist.
4. \(Premise\) One can imagine a being with all God's other properties, that exists.
5. \(2, 3\) A being as described in 4 would be greater than God.
6. \(4, 5\) Therefore one could imagine a being greater than God.
7. \(1, 6\) Contradiction.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Anselm's argument defeats the proposition that "just because it can be imagined does not mean it exists", due to the subject of 'being'. The greatest conceivable being not existing faces a blunt contradiction of its primary definition of 'being' vs a state of nonexistence.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.2. Con: St. Anselm's proof \(3rd premise\) incorrectly treats existence as a property that can be predicated as part of a thing's definition; existence is better treated as a quantifier, as in first order logic.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.2.1. Pro: One can imagine a being with all God's other properties, this does not make it exist.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: The primal characteristic of an inconceivable being \(that is, the being that results by thoughtfully pursuing the greatest conceivable being\) is that it exists: that is the definition of a 'being'. Therefore, to Anselm's argument, imagining this being implies that it can, and philosophically does, exist.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.3. Con: It is not possible to imagine the greatest thing, because we can always imagine something greater than that, in the same way that it is not possible to imagine the highest number, because we can always imagine a higher one.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.3.1. Con: The claim falsely equates "maximal greatness", a qualitative measure, with "maximal magnitude", a quantitative measure. 

It is true that a maximal magnitude cannot exist, so we use the term "infinity" to represent this imaginary concept. However, maximal qualities can exist. There does exist a maximally great "blue"... a blue that is unadulterated by any other color.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.4. Con: The [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/god) of God is not a being which nothing greater can be imagined.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.4.1. Con: The greatest imaginable being would likely have all the properties included in the classical definition of God, so if the argument shows that the greatest imaginable being exists then it follows that it would be God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.4.1.1. Con: That isn't the argument used in the proof, if the argument is changed, the proof is changed.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.4.2. Pro: God is defined as the ultimate being, this is not necessarily the same as the ultimate imaginable being
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.5. Con: If God does not exist, and so is nothing, then we can easily imagine a being greater than God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.5.1. Con: Anselm's exact point is that any being that you can imagine as "greater than God" is, in fact, God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.5.2. Con: To follow Anselm's argument, God as a "being than which no greater can be conceived" undermines any ability for God not to exist. The primal characteristic of a being that is greater than which any other can be conceived is that it *is*. It's being is essential to its definition. Therefore, this being must exist.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.5.3. Pro: This proof would only support the existence of something that nobody could imagine something greater then, that thing need not be God in the traditional sense.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.6. Con: The idea of 'A being greater than B' is not given a proper definition within the argument. Therefore it's unclear whether definition 1. is logically consistent or not.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.3.7. Con: Anselm's argument doesn't define the meaning of 'greater than' properly. A possible meaning of 'greater than' is being 'more like Donald Trump':
1. God is the most like Donald Trump.
2. God doesn't exist.
3. All else equal, a being is more like Donald Trump if it exists.
4. One can imagine a being exactly like God that exists.
5. A being as described by 4 would be more like Donald Trump.
6. Therefore one could imagine a being more like Donald Trump than God.
7. Contradiction.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: The logician Kurt Gödel formulated a [modal ontological argument](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-arguments/#GodOntArg) for God's existence.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6. Pro: Alvin Plantiga has [formulated an ontological argument](http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/theistic-proofs/the-ontological-argument/the-modal-ontological-argument/).
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.1. Con: Plantiga's argument takes as a premise that if atheism were to be true, it would be true contingently, rather than necessarily. This is not certain and without this premise the argument simply shows the triviality that if something has necessary existence as part of its definition it either necessarily exists or necessarily doesn't.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.1.1. Con: A priori does not entail necessary. The parent assumes a priori arguments establish necessary conclusions in virtue of being a priori. This conflates a metaphysical notion with an epistemological notion
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.2. Con: It is not known whether or not it is possible for a god to exist.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.2.1. Con: In [the logical sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_possibility), anything which cannot be proved to be logically contradictory is "possible." It is known that God is not logically contradictory.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: The first section of [Robert Maydole's ontological argument](https://calumsblog.com/apologetics/arguments-for-gods-existence/modal-perfection-argument/), from the beginning to the 23rd step, proves rigorously that supremity is not self-contradictory, so it must be possible. This is all that's necessary for the rest of the argument to work.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: The third assumption made in Robert Maydole’s Modal Ontological argument begs the question by failing to consider an assumption that would resolve the contradiction, and thus simply assume the conclusion.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the PBC part of the argument, the contradiction arose between P\(\[aS\]\) and P\(\[a~S\]\). Since the original assumption was □¬∃x\(Sx\), we must consider that it is also ◇¬P\(\[aS\]\). If the contradiction could be resolved with this as a replaced premise \(in place of premise 3\), then the argument will fail. When you don't consider this at all, you assume that it is possible that a supreme being exists. I.e., you assume the conclusion and beg the question.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.2.1.2. Con: All claims require evidence. Saying "God is possible" is a claim. Since it has not been demonstrated that God is possible, the claim "God is possible" should not be accepted.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.2.2.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.2.1.4. Con: In terms of Platinga's argument it isn't sufficient to establish that God is logically possible. There are more constraints on the universe than logical or internal consistency, even if that internal consistency is that God is contradictory but still possible.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.2.1.4.1. Pro: Although there is nothing logically impossible about an atom with 4000 protons, it is physically impossible.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.2.3.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.3. Con: A condensed version of Plantiga's argument:
\(1 - DEFINITION\) God is a being that either \(a\) exists in every possible world or \(b\) doesn't exist in any possible world
\(2 - ASSUMPTION\) Let's assume \(b\) is false.
\(3 - CONCLUSION\) Therefore \(a\) is true. This implies God exists.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.3.1. Pro: Beings cannot be defined into existence. It is possible that a being defined by \(1\) does not exist.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.3.2. Pro: Unclear how a monotheistic God would be compatible with definition \(1\).
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Hypothetical worlds in which the monotheistic God doesn't exist are trivially possible. Therefore the monotheistic God doesn't have necessary existence.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.3.3. Pro: Assumption \(2\) is baseless. We could just as well assume that \(a\) is false, and conclude that God doesn't exist.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.3.2.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.7. Con: Ontological arguments require that 'existing' is a quality that must manifest to be 'maximal'. That is to say that it refuses a concept being sufficient; it confuses the conceptual and the actual.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.8. Con: The ontological argument for the non-existence of God also exists. \(1\) If a God exists, it exists in every possible world \(a premise from ontological arguments\); \(2\) It is possible that God does not exist; \(3\) \(from \(2\)\) there is some possible world where God does not exist; \(4\) Therefore, God does not exist in every possible world; \(5\) Therefore, God does not exist
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.8.1. Con: Premise 2 is false. Also the argument is logically invalid because premise 1 and 2 contradict each other, therefore the conclusion cannot follow.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.9. Con: A quote from the same [article](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-arguments/) claims that ontological arguments are not persuasive.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.10. Con: Robust [refutations](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-arguments/#ParOntArg) of ontological arguments for the existence of God have reduced ontological proof for God to little more than the subject of parody.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.11. Con: Ontological arguments for the existence of God misunderstand the emptiness of the universe and ascribe that emptiness the name God. This is basically the Primitive Buddhist position.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.12. Pro: [Descartes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ontological/) made an ontological argument for the existence of God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.12.1. Con: Descartes was wrong, the fact that we can conceive of a perfect being does not make it real. Also his arguemnt is tautological, it asumes gods has certain charateristics and having such charcteristics proves he exists.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.12.2. Con: The structure of the argument can be used to prove that any being exists. I can use the same argument to 'prove' that a universe creating meatball exists.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.12.3. Con: Version A of the argument makes the mistake of assuming that a person decides truth.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.12.4. Con: Version B of the argument has an fallacious conclusion. It should read is "Therefore, I have an idea that a supremely perfect being exists."
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.12.5. Con: Existence is not a predicate. It speaks to the quantity of something rather than its qualities. That is, necessary existence is not an essential quality of anything.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.12.5.1. Con: This is not Descartes argument. He believed that the idea of the infinite could not be conceptualizable to the finite human mind. Therefore it had to have a source outside it. That source is God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.12.6. Con: The ability to describe a thing, such as "a supremely perfect being," is not the same as being actually able to imagine or comprehend it. For example, I can describe "A perfect sphere with exactly sixty-three corners and eight faces," but I can't imagine or comprehend it. In the latter case, the thing I described is definitionally impossible. That's not necessarily true of the former, but it is the same kind of statement, and being able to make the statement isn't proof it describes a true state
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.12.7. Con: Properties can be contradictory, meaning that you cannot be maximal in both properties. As such, this argument is invalid.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.12.7.1. Pro: "Maximally Just" is contrary to "Maximally Merciful".
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.13. Pro: Robert Maydole formulated a [modal ontological argument](https://calumsblog.com/apologetics/arguments-for-gods-existence/modal-perfection-argument/) for God's existence
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.13.1. Con: There are counter-examples to the second premise made \(∀Y\(P\(Y\) → \(Z\)\(□∀x\(Yx → Zx\) → P\(Z\)\)\).

"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely." It would seem that a perfection \(i.e. power\) implies an imperfection \(i.e. corruption\). \[[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzBPN-gIGKg)\]
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.13.1.1. Con: Absolute power is the only amount of power that does not corrupt at all, because one in absolute power has nothing to gain from abusing his power, only something to lose.

Example: If God exists, he would be considered to have absolute power, and also be considered to be the only perfectly un-corrupted entity in existence. However, the idea even works in relation to absolute monarchs, whose corruption was in general inversely proportional to the solidity of their reign.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.13.1.1.1. Con: Power corrupts not only in that it may be lost, or that one develops a thirst for it, although those are also factors, but in that it allows one to act unchecked. Consider for example how bored players in open world games often decide to play pranks, or outright murder the NPCs just because they can, an action that secures them no power.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.13.1.2. Con: The quote, "absolute power corrupts absolutely," is only an aphorism and has not been shown to be logically rigorous.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.13.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.2.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.13.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.2.1.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.13.4. Pro: The S5 axiom of modal logic states that necessary statements must be either true or impossible. For instance, if it can be shown that it's possible that 2x2=4 \(such as by bringing 2 sets of 2 pebbles together and counting them\), 2x2=4 must be necessary in all possible worlds, and thus true. God's existence is a necessary statement, so if it is possible, it must be true.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.13.4.1. Pro: The definition of supremity used in the argument, that it is impossible for anything to be greater than a supreme being, is a necessary statement \(since it contains the term "impossible"\). If it is can be shown to be possible that it is impossible for anything to be greater than x, then it is impossible for anything to be greater than x, so a supreme being exists. Any supreme being would be considered God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Cosmological arguments](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmological-argument/) support the existence of God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: It is possible that the universe came into being on its own.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Before the universe existed, the laws of time, space, and causality may not have existed.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: It is a completely speculative statement to say that the laws of time and space may not have existed.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The laws of space and time did not exist before the universe was created, as neither space, nor time existed until the universe did.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This fact supports modal arguments that say the universe did not come into being on it's own.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: A vacuum is a very potent thing to create something. Modern physics [shows](https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2010-12/making-something-nothing-theory-says-matter-can-be-conjured-vacuum) that there could apear something out of vacuum.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: A vacuum already implies the existence of space.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.3.2. Con: This claim cites a source that indicates that a high powered laser can create particles in a vacuum. The claim is saying that the vacuum is creating the particles. Non sequitur. The fact that power is necessary to create matter from energy should fill you with awe considering the amount of power used to create the universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.4. Con: If at any point nothing existed, then nothing would exist at all.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.4.1. Con: A steady state universe would also require a cause, or else be causeless.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: In the entire history of observation there has never been an event that was not caused.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.4.2.1. Con: While this may be true, we cannot know it with certainty because we have not assessed every event that has ever occurred.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.4.2.2. Con: The [problem of induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction) calls into question whether this means uncaused events have never or will never happen.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.4.3. Con: If each event required a cause that would necessitate an infinitely old steady state universe, which would break the laws of thermodynamics as it would create a situation where net entropy decreased over time.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.4.3.1. Pro: A steady state universe would also require a cause, or else be causeless.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.5. Pro: The cosmological argument rests on a premise that is unsupported: "whatever begins to exist must have a cause". This is an unsuppprted assumption. We know there are quantum particles pop in and out of existence with no known cause, and we know that natural laws break down at singularity. The universe began at a singularity so you can't assume laws of the current universe dictate its behavior. It may or may not be possible for a singularity to change state with no cause, so the argument fails.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.5.1. Con: The cosmological argument does not require a thing to begin to exist, but to exist at all.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.5.2. Con: Lack of knowledge of the cause of quantum particles appearing does not count as evidence that they are non-caused.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.6. Pro: Trying to explain the universe based on human experience alone is insufficient. At the time the cosmological argument began we had a very limited knowledge of how the world worked.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.7. Con: It is possible but is it the best explanation? All our observations tell us that effects must have causes. Therefore, a caused universe is more in line with our observations, and thus more scientific, than an uncaused universe would be.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.7.1. Con: Working backwards, there must be at least one event with no cause.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.7.1.1. Con: In the context of the cosmological arguments, first events don't lack a cause. Instead, they are caused by an external entity, which is itself causeless.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.7.1.1.1. Con: If an external entity is causeless, it must be spontaneous, therefore making the external entity's existence a spontaneous event. Since a spontaneous event is necessary, to create this entity, there is no reason to believe the entity causing event would be any more likely then a universe creating event.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.8. Con: The axiom of logic that states that effects have causes that precede them in a chain of causation is independent of the physical laws, and as such remains in effect regardless of the status of the universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.8.1. Con: We assume effects have causes because this is what we see. It is not an axiom of logic which allows us to assume a cause without providing a reason to do so.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.8.1.1. Con: We do not in fact observe all causes for all effects.  We do in fact assume causes for all effects because effects would be unintelligible/inexplicable without them \(i.e. no reason, cause, or ground for them to be\).  Accordingly, the law of cause and effect is necessary for intelligible science.  Therefore, it is appropriately an axiom of logic because without it the universe is unintelligible.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.8.1.1.1. Con: The universe does not need to be intelligible, and science does not need to be true. The evidence suggests that in general they are, and they have proven useful, but that science is convenient is not a logical argument that it exists.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.8.1.1.2. Con: We have observed random events in the form of quantum mechanics. As we know random events exists, we know that there are events without a cause.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.8.1.1.2.1. Con: An event being random doesn't mean that it lacks a cause.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.8.1.1.2.1.1. Con: If events 1a and 1b are equally likely random events assuming event 1, event 1 may be considered a cause, but if a happens, that a happened, and b did not was not caused.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.8.1.1.2.2. Con: Quantum events do have a cause in the form of fluctuating fields and consistent, though imprecise, laws.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.8.1.1.2.2.1. Con: The causes of quantum events are partial, and insufficient to explain, or predict the event.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.9. Pro: If causality did not exist, the universe would never have been caused to exist.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.9.1. Con: Causality is not something that logically could fail to exist because it is an abstract concept like evil.  Evil is essentially that which opposes the all powerful being whether there is any manifestation of it or not.  The concept exists.  Whether it applies to anything is another matter altogether.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.9.2. Con: The form of the parent argument contradicts itself. By explaining that the universe would not need a reason to exist, it gives a reason why the universe would not need a reason to exist.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Consider two identical universes, one with God and the other without. If no distinction can be made between the two universes, then the existence of a deity does not hold any explanatory power.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Positing the existence of an otherwise identical Godless reality to show that God is not necessary in our reality is a circular argument. It requires the assumption that God is not necessary for all realities to prove that assumption.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: The argument involving two identical realities exemplifies that the claimed necessity of God, as well as claims that God is unnecessary, are bald and are presumed. To say God is or is not necessary requires more than lipservice. Since we can discard mere lipservice, we're left with the dilemma that each hypothetical universe is identical in all other respects. That means there's no experience or feature of reality that can stand to tell us the kind of universe we actually live in.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: This argument itself is a circular argument. It assumes that to show that God exists, one has to exlude from consideration all realities where God doesn't exist.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: The posited consideration requires the assumption that we collectively understand enough about the universe to model its behavior in entirety.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: The fact that the things of our everyday experience are [composite](https://github.com/Tenari/non-fiction/blob/master/neo_platonic-proof-for-god.md), or composed of more than one distinct part, eventually leads to the conclusion that God exists.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1. Con: All popular versions of the cosmological argument arbitrarily decide that a god does not require a creator. To arbitrarily require this is [special pleading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading).
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: [Aquinas' First Way](http://www.aquinasonline.com/Topics/firstway-analysis.pdf), and the [Neo-Platonic proof](https://github.com/Tenari/non-fiction/blob/master/neo_platonic-proof-for-god.md) result in a God who could not, in principle, have been created.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: The distinction between [Act and Potency](http://aquinas.wjduquette.com/?p=407=1), combined with the visible fact of [change](http://www.aquinasonline.com/Topics/firstway-analysis.pdf) in our world, entails the existence of an "[Unmoved Mover](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Unmoved_mover)," \(aka. uncaused causer, un-actualized actualizer\) which is God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Reality is not divided by Act and Potency.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If there were no Potency, change could not occur, and if there were no Act, then nothing would exist.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Things that are pure actuality, such as an unmoved mover, are [incapable of change](http://aquinas.wjduquette.com/?p=407). Therefore, things that are pure actuality do not have the capacity to create. If a god is pure actuality, it cannot have created the universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Pure actuality is indeed incapable of change. But, pure actuality can create. This is because the act of creation doesn't necessarily entail that the creator must itself change.

Creation/change can only be done by something already in existence; It does not follow that this thing must change in order to create.

If creation required self-change, then the per se causal chains we see in the world would have no first member, which is incoherent, given the nature of per se causal chains.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Creation constitutes change, especially in the context of origins. Where before, God could be defined as "the only existing entity", the act of creation changes God's definition to "one of many existing entities".
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: This changes God by removing the uniqueness of his existence.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This implies that whenever anything about the universe changes, my essence fundamentally changes as well. Because before, I could be defined as a human living in the universe with state A, but after the change, I would have to be defined as a human living in the universe with state B. This seems absurd. I have not \(necessarily\) changed because a star was born 10,000 light-years away.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Changes don't have to be fundamental. Any change is too much for an all act entity.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: A star being born may not affect you, but consider the difference that having an identical twin would have. Loss of uniqueness is extremely consequential, especially for an all act god.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: This changes God by giving him relationships.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Relationships are external to the entity, and do not \(necessarily\) affect its essence.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: The idea of "before creation" is incoherent, because creation includes the creation of time. The word "before" does not apply to an extra-temporal context.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: There are two kinds of properties: [Cambridge](https://www.amazon.com/God-Soul-Key-Texts-Classic/dp/1890318558) [properties](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Cambridge_change) and Real properties.

The doctrine of divine immutability properly understood says that God cannot change in any real properties, but it allows that he may change with respect to his Cambridge properties.

God's having created the world is a mere Cambridge property, which shows that creation does not constitute change in the pertinent sense.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: A real property is a property intrinsic to some substance or entity.
A [Cambridge property](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Cambridge_change) is a property of a substance or entity which is in some sense extrinsic, usually relational.

Bob growing a beard is a real change, because it involves the acquisition of a real property.
But for Bob to become shorter than Tom, merely because Tom has grown and Bob has stayed the same, is a Cambridge change, because it involves the acquisition of a mere Cambridge property.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: God creating the universe and removing his own uniqueness in terms of existence would be a real change.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.2. Con: [Real change is \(roughly\) change involved in causing something...](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/immutability/)
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Creation constitutes change in that before creation, God could be defined as "an entity which has not created" to "an entity that has created"
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: It is not necessary for a substance to undergo change in order to act.

While it is true that the things of our common experience must undergo change themselves when they act upon other things, it does not follow that absolutely anything that acts must necessarily undergo change itself when it acts. To draw such an inference is to commit the [fallacy of accident](https://infogalactic.com/info/Accident_\(fallacy\)).
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Creation is one of many things that the classical definition of a god includes.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Act and Potency as metaphysical notions are built on an archaic understanding of physics and therefore only exist today as metaphors with no rationale.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The fact that a semantic distinction can be made between actuality and potentiality does not imply anything but our own creativity.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The distinction between act and potency is not merely semantic, but is a real feature of the world.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: The very first of the famous [Twenty Four Thomistic Theses](http://www.catholicapologetics.info/catholicteaching/philosophy/thomast.htm) is: “Potency and Act divide being in such a way that whatever is, is either pure act, or of necessity it is composed of potency and act as primary and intrinsic principles.”
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.3.1.3. Con: The postulation of Act and Potency as real features of the universe is a claim which is impossible to verify scientifically.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: The scientific method itself presupposes the existence of Act and Potency as real features of the world. Since these notions are implicit in the business of science, it is intrinsically impossible to scientifically verify their existence.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.3.1.3.2. Con: Since science is not the only source of truth, it is not necessary to verify the distinction between Act and Potency, if the distinction can be verified in another way.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.3.1.3.2.1. Con: Science is the only source for verified metaphysical truth.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.3.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Science cannot verify the truth of mathematics. Science presupposes the truth of mathematics in order to function. But mathematics contains verified truth, so science cannot be the only valid source for truth.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.3.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Mathematics can not verify metaphysical truths, only model scientific truth.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.3.1.3.2.2. Pro: The distinction between Act and Potency can be verified deductively, following from the fact of existence, and the fact that change occurs in reality.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2. Con: If one accepts that the universe came into existence, then to argue it must have been caused assumes that the current laws of the universe were the same at the time of creation. We know that the physical laws break down at a certain point, so it is conceivable that the cause/effect principle did not apply at the beginning.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The principle of causation is not a physical law.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The principle of causation only states that causes are at least partially responsible for effects, and effects are at least partially dependent on causes. It isn't necessary that time be involved whatsoever.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Imagine a ball colliding with a sheet of fabric. When the ball impacts with the fabric it creates a dent in it - but the dent appears at the exact same time as the impact. However, despite no time difference between the cause and effect, we still know which is which.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2. Con: The argument from change \(properly understood\) makes no claim about the historical creation of the universe. This would be a "per accidens" causal chain, which can, in theory, extend backwards forever. The argument depends on a "per se" causal chain which is present at every distinct moment of existence. Thus the "physical laws" are irrelevant to the validity of the argument.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Per se [causal chains](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2010/08/edwards-on-infinite-causal-series.html) cannot regress to infinity, as opposed to per accidens causal chains.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Infinite causal chains are possible in an infinite universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Only "per accidens" chains may regress to infinity. \(These are also occasionally referred to as linear chains.\)

"Per se" chains may not regress to infinity, regardless of the infinitude \(or lack thereof\) of the universe. \(These are also occasionally referred to as hierarchical chains.\)
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Per se causal chains are composed of a principal cause, and a series of subsequent instrumental causes. An instrumental cause is one that derives whatever causal power it has from something else. In Aquinas’ famous example, the stick that the hand uses to push the stone has no power to push the stone on its own, but derives its stone-moving power from the hand, which uses it as an “instrument.” A principal cause is one that does have its causal power inherently.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Our universe is not infinite.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Unless a method by which a finite thing can become infinity big in a finite time is provided, the big bang is sufficient to disprove an infinite universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The universe was not necessarily finite in size prior to the Big Bang, it was only [infinitely dense](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/cosmology-and-astronomy/universe-scale-topic/big-bang-expansion-topic/a/how-can-the-universe-be-infinite-if-it-started-expanding-138-billion-years-ago) in \(at least\) one area.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The term "prior" in relation to the big bang has no meaning.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: According to the big bang theory, time itself came into existence at the big bang.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.1.2.1.2. Con: In the spirit of Einstein's theory of general relativity; the Big Bang was not a point in space but a moment in time. The Big Bang happened at all points in space at the same time. It is incorrect to say that the primordial universe was of finite size as this concept of size in not well-defined as such. It is unclear whether the universe is of finite size, however observational data best fit with the conclusion that the universe is infinite and flat.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: A causal chain can regress to infinity just as it can continue onward to infinity, provided that no change in the given direction of time starts from or results in something which is incapable of accumulating change, and provided the environment involved doesn't reach a stage in the given direction of time which permanently prohibits the accumulation of change in that temporal direction.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: "per accidens" \(or linear\) causal chains can indeed regress to infinity.

However, there is another kind of causal chain. This kind of causal chain cannot, by its very nature, regress to infinity. "Per se" \(or hierarchical\) causal chains are ones where each link has its causal power instrumentally, not inherently. Per se causal chains occur simultaneously, all at once.

To bring "time" into the discussion is to discuss per accidens causal chains, which are not a part of the proof.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.3. Con: Even if it is true that causal chains cannot regress infinitely, assuming that the first cause is God is begging the question.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: The argument is inductive, as it assumes all changes have causes from our experience, which is bound by the natural laws. That being said, these laws many not apply on the quantum level or at the beginning of the universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.3. Con: Time is a measure of change - without time, there is no change. As such, it does not make sense to discuss a cause that brought the universe and time into existence, since the universe going from potential to actual entails change.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Change does not require time to pass. Change in the broad sense meant here means only "actualization of potential." If there were no time, but only one moment of existence for our world, that moment would still require the actualization of the potential for existence in all the myriad things of this world. Thus, each and every distinct moment of time, and not any collection of moments, represents "change" in the relevant sense.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Change is a "an act or process through which something becomes different." Acts and processes ential time; indeed, Aristotle recognized that time is a measure of change. To speak about a moment of "existence" without time is nonsensical, as nothing has been demonstrated to exist outside of time.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: While temporal change is a valid kind of change, it is not the \(only\) kind of change meant by the proof from change. As stated in the proof, all that is meant by "change" is "actualization of potential." Temporal change is a subset of the kind of change meant here.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: A potential cannot become actual without the passing of time. This follows because a potential isn't actual, and while it can *become* actual this must temporally follow the state where it hasn't yet been actualized. It is impossible for there to be no temporal distinction between a potential and an actuality, because such a thing would imply the potential and the actuality are the same thing \(which they by definition aren't\). Therefore there must be passing of time for change to happen.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: An instance in time is analagous to a picture. Change occurs over subsequent instances, much like a series of photos can demonstrate change in the setting.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.4. Con: The argument doesn't negate the possibility of multiple unmoved movers.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.1. Con: This series of "unmoved movers" would, as a whole comprise the single set we would understand as a classical theistic god.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.2. Con: In order for there to be multiple unmoved movers \(composed of Pure Act\), there must be some differentiating feature that one mover has and the others lack.
There can only be a differentiating feature if there is some unactualized potential one mover has.

But this defeats the definition of the unmoved mover as pure act, with no potentiality whatsoever.

Thus, if there is an unmoved mover, by definition, there must only be one. \(Oneness being a classical attribute of God\)
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.2.1. Con: There is no need for there to be a differentiating feature beyond it not being the same one.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.2.1.1. Con: Two things can only be distinct if they have some feature which differentiates them. Even two theoretically identical apples are different in that they are not in the same location, and are not composed of the exact same atoms. There must be at least one differentiating feature.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: If God is everywhere then location does not matter. If God is immaterial then atoms don't factor into the differentiation.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.2.2. Con: There is no reason to assume that any of the other non-composite entities need to be pure act \(Unmoved movers\).
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.2.2.1. Con: By definition, an Unmoved Mover, First Cause or Necessary Being must be pure act.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.5. Con: Things that are pure act are incapable of change. Therefore, they cannot be omnipotent, which goes against the set definition for this debate.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.14.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.5.2. Pro: The classical definition of a god includes omnipotence.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.5.4. Con: The definition of omnipotence encompasses all that is logically possible.  Things like creating a square circle, or a four sided triangle, or in this case a change to that which is unchangeable are impossible by definition, and therefore the equivalent of semantic nonsense.  In other words it's like asking "Can God have 'colorless green ideas that sleep furiously'?" While it's grammatically correct, the question is incoherent.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.6. Pro: [This](https://proofs.herokuapp.com/theorems/63) is another formulation of Aquinas' First Way.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.1. Con: The universe is considered a thermodynamic closed system, i.e. nothing exists 'outside' of it per se. This means it cannot be affected by something not in the system. If God exists, he should exist solely and wholly in the universe, not without.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.1.1. Con: God, as defined in this debate, is transcendant, not contained by the universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.14.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7. Pro: [The contingency argument](http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/theistic-proofs/the-cosmological-argument/the-argument-from-contingency/) \(also known as the Leibnizian or modal cosmological argument\) states that anything which exists must have sufficient reason to exist. Since the universe exists it must have a sufficient reason, and that reason would be God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1. Pro: Any entity able to cause the universe's existence would be transcendent, necessary, enormously powerful, and rational \(because an irrational abstract ideal has no creative power\). Such an entity would rightfully be called God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.1. Con: The universe could have been the result of a spontaneous event.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.1.1. Con: No event can be truly "spontaneous", in the sense of lacking a cause. Even if they seem random, events are necessarily the result of their surroundings and of some external action.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: If the assumption that spontaneous events were impossible was valid, every event would need a cause, meaning there could be no first event. It has already been assumed/shown in the proof from composition, that there must be a first event. Therefore spontaneous event, at least in the context of this discussion, must be possible.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.7.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_\(philosophy\)#Davidson) definitionally refer to objects, spatiotemporal contexts, and causal relationships. An event cannot occur without a cause.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.1.2. Con: The existence of something that has a beginning or is contingent, but yet does not have a cause has never been observed.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2. Con: Any argument that refers to the "cause" of the universe is circular. A cause by its very nature precedes whatever it has caused. The universe, by definition, is all of spacetime. Since all of time is a part of the universe, it is logically impossible for anything to precede it.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2.2. Pro: It is impossible for any contingent thing to have preceded the universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2.2.1. Con: God is by definition necesary.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Ontological arguments for God's existence provide a case for His necessity.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2.3. Con: If that were true then time would go back infinitely which it does not. There is a clear cut [beginning](http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-beginning-of-time.html).
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2.4. Con: A cause need not be chronologically prior to its effect, but must be ontologically prior to its effect.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2.4.1. Pro: Our best scientific evidence indicates that time came into existence. The cause for this event, commonly known as the "Big Bang" must necessarily have existed prior to creation, but obviously could not have existed chronologically prior \(at a point in time prior\) to time.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2.4.1.1. Con: A serious theory of the multiverse is that various universes are nested through the formation of black holes. Our Universe may have come forth from the collapse of a giant star into a singularity in a parent universe. It solves many problems. It could be that there are many "times" all at once.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.3.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2.4.1.1.2. Con: The Bord-Guth-Vilenkin [theory applies as wel](https://winteryknight.com/2017/03/16/alexander-vilenkin-all-the-evidence-we-have-says-that-the-universe-had-a-beginning-6/)l to a "bubble" multiverse.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.2. Con: The contingency argument is self-defeating since it implies that God must also have a sufficient reason to exist.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.2.1. Con: The Principle of Sufficient Reason suggests that everything requires a sufficient reason for its existence, but says nothing about whether this reason is internal or external to the thing itself.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.2.1.1. Con: If God could be the sufficient reason for his own existence, so could the universe be it's own reason for existence.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.2.1.1.1. Con: The universe requires a necessary cause whose nonexistence would be impossible. The universe itself is known to not be necessary, and its nonexistense is entirely conceivable.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.2.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no reason to assume God's nonexistence is impossible.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2.2.1.1.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Although it is describable as an empty point in space with nothing, not even space, on all sides, minus the point, an actual conception of it's non-existence, and actual conception of nothing, is at the very least quite hard.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.2.1.1.1.6. Con: The universe does not require a cause.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.2.1.1.1.6.1. Pro: If there was no time before the universe, there was nothing causally prior to the universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.2.1.1.1.6.2. Pro: If the [b-theory of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-theory_of_time) is true the universe needs no cause.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.2.1.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.2.1.2. Con: It is circular reasoning to claim that something's existence is the reason for its existence.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.2.2. Con: God exists by the necessity of His own nature.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.3. Con: If accepted, this would only show that God is necessary when the universe exists, so God, in this case, is only as necessary as the universe is.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.3.1. Con: The "necessity" referred to in the contingency argument is modal necessity, meaning that God's nonexistence would be logically impossible - not that God is "necessary" to explain some data. Equating the two commits the [fallacy of equivocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation).
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.3.2. Con: God's necessity in the contingency argument is a premise which is defended separately, unrelated to the existence of the universe.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.3.3. Con: While an intelligent cause may exist without a particular effect, an effect cannot exist without a cause. DaVinci would have existed had he not painted the Mona Lisa; the Mona Lisa could not have existed without DaVinci.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4. Con: God, with the qualities of [Classical Theism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism), is not necessarily the root cause of the universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1. Con: If [evil](https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Augustine/augustine_evil.html) is a [privation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privation) of good, then a thing that has no flaw is perfectly good by definition. The Unmoved Mover is Pure Act \(containing no potentiality\) and therefore is the perfect realization of its own essence. But if it is perfectly good, then it is "omni-benevolent."
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.1. Con: There is no reason to assume that good is the natural state that evil is a privation from.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.1.1. Pro: Evil has not been established to be accurately described as a mere lack of good. For example, if donating a billion dollars to a specific charity were good, failing to make that donation would not mean you are evil.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.2. Con: Flawlessness does not necessitate moral goodness.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.2.1. Con: Flawlessness by definition necessitates moral goodness. For if a thing was not morally good, how could that thing be flawless? Its lack of moral goodness would be a flaw. But if it truly is flawless, then it is necessarily morally good.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.2.1.1. Con: There are no mentions of moral goodness in the [definition for flawlessness](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/flawless). Furthermore, morally neutral things can be considered flawless.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.3. Con: If evil is just a privation of good, then nothing is wrong. It could only be properly called "less good". This would mean that murder, rape, etc, are not wrong, they are simply less good.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.3.1. Con: The words "evil" and "wrong" still have meaning in the context of the privation view of evil. "Wrong" would refer to some action which corrupts the good. And evil could refer to a state of affairs strongly contrary to the good. But thinking of things as "less good" is in fact a more precise characterization, as it contains the privation aspect of evil, where the simple word "evil" can be misunderstood to imply a separately existing standard or entity by which evil is measured.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.3.1.1. Con: If things can only exist on different gradations of goodness, then rape and murder must be inherently good in some way. The fact that they exist does not make them good.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: If a god punishes things that are good, then the god lacks justice and is therefore not omnibenevolent.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Rape and murder are actions which corrupt that which is already good. To the extent they fail to completely destroy the goodness in a thing, they fail to be completely evil. But in order for a rape or murder to take place, there must be a living innocent to start with. There must be some good which is corrupted \(or destroyed\) by the evil act.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: If it were true that things were evil solely because of the of good they destroyed, murdering an innocent 4 year old would be less wrong then murdering an old rapist, but these acts are equally wrong, therefore, it can not be true that things are evil solely because of the amount of good they destroy.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: This implies that if a person were not innocent or good, that they cannot be raped.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.3.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Anyone being raped by definition is innocent. No one deserves rape. That's what rape is: undeserved, forced sex.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.3.1.1.2.3. Con: If rape and murder are evil, and rape and murder exist, then evil exists. If evil exists, it is not a mere lack of good.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.3.1.2. Con: If evil is contrary to "the good" then it cannot be considered a privation. It must be its own idea.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.3.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.3.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.3.2. Pro: Nothing is purely 100% totally "wrong" in this sense, because everything that exists, no matter how corrupted it be, still exists, and existence itself is good.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.3.2.1. Con: If things can only exist on different gradations of goodness, then rape and murder must be inherently good in some way. The fact that they exist does not make them good.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.2. Con: If there is an Unmoved Mover at the root of all change in the universe, then that means every potentiality which is actualized, or even could be actualized is fundamentally derivative of that Mover. To be able to actualize every possible potentiality is just what it means to be "omnipotent."
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.2.1. Con: This kind of "omnipotence" need only be in place at the time of the universe's creation, and does not need to be an active force, making the Unmoved Mover a deistic God, rather than theistic.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.2.1.1. Con: The Unmoved Mover is not proved by reference to a chronological beginning of the world, but rather a hierarchical "beginning" of the world, which is here and now, at every moment of time in action.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: In fact, Aquinas considered that reason alone could not prove that the world had a beginning. Aristotle considered that the universe had always existed, yet he made a similar first-way [argument](http://www.logicmuseum.com/ontological/aristotleontological.htm) for the existence of God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.14.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.2.1.3. Con: The Unmoved Mover is outside of time \(eternal\), therefore it is present before the begining of time and has no end.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.2.2. Con: The ability to actualize is distinct from actualization. The ability to actualize requires decision making power, whereas intelligence is not required for actualization. The ultimate cause of the universe only requires actualization.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.2.3. Con: If there is NOT an Unmoved Mover at the root of all change in the universe, then that means no potentiality which is actualized, or even could be actualized is fundamentally derivative of such an Unmoved Mover. No such Unmoved Mover has been demonstrated to exist, let alone to exist and be omnipotent. If an Unmoved Mover does not exist, then it can have no direct effect on the real world and is therefore not omnipotent in reality.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.3. Pro: God being the likely \(but not certain\) cause of the universe does not prove the existence of God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.3.1. Con: An argument doesn't need to logically prove a claim to act as supporting evidence.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.6. Con: Free will exists within the universe, and can only be caused by another free will. Thus the thing which caused the universe had free will, and must be an intelligent being.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.6.1. Con: The assumption that things must come from things like them is false, as the rocks, and sticks that start a fire are not hot.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.6.2. Con: There is no objective evidence for the existence of free will in the universe, thus free will does not exist.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.8. Con: Possible causes of the universe other than God are extremely unlikely.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.8.1. Con: God as a cause of the creation of the universe is at least as extremely unlikely as any other of the extremely unlikely causes.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.8.2. Con: To accept one particular claim on the grounds that other claims appear unlikely is a false dichotomy \(there may be other claims we have not evaluated\) and a shifting of the burden of proof.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.9. Con: The law of entropy indicates that the cause of the universe must be infinite and completely lacking entropy.  If God's entropy is 0 and he is infinite than he must necessarily be good at least to the extent that entropy is defined as lack of order or chaos.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.9.1. Con: The law of entropy does not require the universe be infinite, or to lack entropy at the beginning.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.9.2. Con: Saying something could be the answer does not make it more likely then other scenarios.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.9.3. Con: There's no reason to believe the second law of thermodynamics matters in respect to metaphysical claims. It doesn't even necessarily affect all physical claims because we still haven't figured out how the laws of pshysics worked during the beginning of the universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.10. Con: Being the ultimate cause of everything that has a cause would be omnipotence in the purest form.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.11. Pro: Even if there were some force that pushed the universe to existence, there is no evidence it would resemble the humanity's understanding of the God rather than simply another law of physics. For example, there is no evidence that the force that created the universe has any knowledge of Earth or humans, or that it is even capable of such a thing.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.12. Pro: Just because something may have created the universe doesn't mean the force that did knows about humans or Earth in any way. Seeing the number of objects in space, it is incredibly unlikely.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.13. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.5.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.14. Con: There is an extensive amount of evidence suggesting the cause of the universe fits the properties of the classical God, as gathered by Aquinas in the [Summa Contra Gentiles](http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles1.htm).
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.15. Con: This is a red herring; even if true, it does not refute the claim it purports to refute.

It also ignores that these attributes of God are established by other arguments for the existence of God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.16. Con: Intelligence is suggested by the incredibly precise conditions found in the universe that allow life to exist.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.17. Con: The Kalam cosmological argument doesn't claim God is omnibenevolent.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5. Pro: The universe is contingent \(meaning its nonexistence is possible\).

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.6. Pro: The existence of contingent things must ultimately be grounded in some necessary thing, or else they wouldn't exist at all. This necessary thing would be God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2.2.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.6.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.6.3. Con: A necessary thing cannot alone give rise to a contingent thing. Since a necessary thing must in all its qualities and details exist, anything it alone gave rise to must likewise exist and is not contingent.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.6.3.1. Con: Contingent existence does not entail autonomous entities entirely separate from the necessary thing. A necessary thing can communicate complexity in its qualities and details without simple duplication. Contingent things share in those qualities and details, and do not possess them simply.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.7. Con: The contingency argument begins with a generalization about things that exist, namely that they require a reason for existence. However, the generalization is formed entirely based on knowledge of things that exist within the universe, bound by the laws of the universe. There is no basis for assuming that the laws that govern the things that make up the universe would also apply to the universe itself. This is the fallacy of composition.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.7.1. Con: The principle of sufficient reason only states that for every thing that exists, there exist or existed conditions sufficient for it to exist. This seems tautologically true - if conditions weren't sufficient for something to exist, then that thing wouldn't exist, by the definition of "sufficient."
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.8. Con: God's necessity is an assumption. It cannot be proven.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.8. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.9. Con: There is no need to resort to God to explain the changes we see, as a chain of mundane causes could stretch back into infinity.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.10. Con: There does not necessarily need to be an unmoved mover to explain efficient motion in the world. The world could be explained by circular causes.  For example, A cause B, B caused C, C caused D, and D caused A.  Reality could be structured that acts of potency change into acts of actuality in a circular fashion, hence an unmoved mover would not be necessary to explain original physical motion.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.10.1. Con: Such a structure of reality seems to require an infinitely-old universe with an infinite regression of causes and events. Such a regression is logically impossible, and stands at odds with scientific evidence for a finite universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.11. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.12. Pro: [This](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c2V7wEJB5dFkLgDPqnnCE3rrFUGX80GH4EVFwoeiUY4/edit#slide=id.p) is yet another formulation of the argument in sequential fashion.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.12.1. Con: No proof is offered in this link unless we assume the nature of humans to be an arbitrarily defined philosophical entity; something which is virtually impossible to test scientifically or verify
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.13. Con: An "Unmoved Mover" \(aka a being of Pure Actuality\) is not the same thing as God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.13.2. Con: The Unmoved Mover is by definition the the ultimate cause of the existence of things, and whatever else God is supposed to be, He is the ultimate cause of things.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.13.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.13.5. Con: This is an issue of semantics. Call it God, call it Great Green Arkleseizure, we are talking about the same thing.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.13.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.14.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.13.6. Pro: The Unmoved Mover and the First Cause describe a deistic god, not a classical theistic God.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.13.6.2. Con: It is not necessary for a single line of evidence to completely describe all features of God. It is enough to say that the evidence supports the existence of a being that meets the classical existence of God. Other lines of evidence may supply more information of God's other attributes.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.13.6.3. Con: According to classical theism, God is the ["absolutely metaphysically ultimate being"](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Classical_theism). If a being is a First Cause, this this the same thing as being metaphysically ultimate, therefore the First Cause is God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.13.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.13.6.3.2. Con: The claim defines "absolutely metaphysically ultimate being" as simply the first cause. While the link defines classical theism differently by adding personhood and multiple attributes to the first cause that hasn't been demonstrated. Using the two interchangebly is a fallacy of equivocation.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.14. Con: This involves "change" and "motion" are used as a mere synonym for "coming into existence"/actualization. Since some things do not exist, this entails the Unmoved mover is not perfect, not omnipotent, or both. Therefore, the Unmoved mover is not God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2. Con: The neo-platonic model claims that God, a being that is all-powerful, all-knowing, and exists outside of time and space, is absolutely simple. This is contradictory.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1. Con: All that is meant by "absolutely simple" is that [God is without parts](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Divine_simplicity). The being of God is identical to the "attributes" of God. In other words, such characteristics as omnipresence, goodness, truth, eternity, etc. are identical to God's being. There is no contradiction inherent here.

In fact, an absolutely simple being is of necessity pure Actuality \(as opposed to potentiality\) and thus is necessarily all-powerful, all-knowing, immaterial, etc.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3. Con: Then an absolutely simple thing is anything that is, by definition, itself. This can be literally anything, making the argument pointless.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Anything that is composed of potentiality and actuality is not simple. Which is \(nearly\) everything you interact with on a daily basis.

There is a simple test for simplicity: can the thing be logically divided into discrete parts?
If yes: it is not simple.
If no: it is simple.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Electrons, photons, quarks, and gluons all fit this definition. Claiming it is God is still unnecessary and arbitrary.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The parts of the atom are composed of two metaphysical parts: potentiality and reality. They are real to the extent that any given neutron is really present. But they are potential to the extent that any given neutron could be in a different location, or energy state, or really could be changed in any way. Since the parts of the atom are all changeable they are not metaphysically simple.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The definition of simple that was provided says nothing about not being changeable.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Changeability implies composition of the metaphysical parts: [act and potency.](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/05/act-and-potency.html) Composition is contrary to the definition of simplicity.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If Composition is contrary to simplicity and changeability means composition, then any description of god changing in any way is proof that god is not simple. God becoming his own son, or creating new laws at any point, for instance, point to god being changeable. Therefore, many descriptions of a god are changeable and cannot be considered simple.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Even the elementary subatomic particles may not be simple, but may be composed of simpler things, such as strings.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Then those simpler things are not composite.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.1.3. Con: It is fallacious to claim that because two objects share one property in common, that they must be identical.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Many descriptions of God can be split into smaller parts.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.1. Con: While the statement "God is omnipotent" does not mean the same thing as "God is omniscient", it doesn't follow that they are not statements about the same one reality.

[Gottlob Frege](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Gottlob_Frege) famously distinguished between the ['sense' of an expression and its 'reference'](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Sense_and_reference).

"The evening star" does not have the same sense as "the morning star", but both expressions refer to one and the same thing--namely, the planet Venus. Similarly for descriptions of God.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.2. Con: When we talk about a human's power, or his intellect, we are talking about actually different things. But precisely because God is noncomposite \(lacking distinct parts\), we cannot apply these terms in exactly the same sense. We must apply them in an [analogical](http://www.iep.utm.edu/rel-lang/#SSH2b.iii) sense. \(as opposed to a [univocal](http://www.iep.utm.edu/rel-lang/#SSH2b.ii) or [equivocal](http://www.iep.utm.edu/rel-lang/#SSH2b.i) sense. [see also](http://www.philosophyzer.com/univocal-and-equivocal-language/)\)

Under an analogical use of language describing God, the many descriptions of Him fail to be split into smaller parts, as they all remain descriptions of the same thing.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: Equivocal Term: A term that has a variety of different meanings. An associate equivocal term has completely different intentions once it’s used. For instance, the term “Chihuahua” will signify \(a\) a breed of dog; \(b\) a state of Mexico.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: Univocal Term: A term that has only one meaning. That is, it signifies only one thought, and therefore corresponds to only one definition. Words mean the same thing even when applied in different contexts, for example, black shoes, black hair, black car.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.2.3. Pro: Analogous Term: A term that is supposed to convey one or additional similar characteristics that exist between two ideas.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.2.4. Con: Premises 2 and 3 of the Analogous terms are unsupported.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.3. Pro: Brahman in Hinduism is split into smaller gods.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.3.1. Con: If Brahman can be split, he is not simple, ergo he is not the God of classical theism.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.3.1.1. Con: This description of a god meets the criteria for the definition of a god under the classical theistic definition. Therefore, it is fair to discuss.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.4. Pro: In Catholicism, the Holy Trinity is composed of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.4.1. Con: Whether the Trinitarian description of God compromises the absolute simplicity of God is another debate entirely. This debate is about the classical theistic conception of God, which is not exclusive to the Catholic Church.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.3.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.5. Con: A description of an entity is not the entity itself.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.3. Con: Aquinas's conclusion only uses the word god as an end point. There is no justification for its use in his argument.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: The cosmological arguments add additional details to a "rule" so that God can be excluded from that rule e.g. "everything that exists had a cause for its existence" becomes "everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence".
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: There is no reason to make a distinction between things that exist and things that began to exist, other than to tailor-fit the pre-conceived conclusion that God exists.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.2.1.1. Con: On the contrary... the difference between necessary and [contingent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_%28philosophy%29) objects was recognized and discussed by the ancient philosophers. The added phrase is a clarification that is required to allow for the very existence of necessary objects.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.3. Con: The argument from the act/potency divide \(at least in its [valid](http://www.aquinasonline.com/Topics/firstway-analysis.pdf) [form](https://proofs.herokuapp.com/theorems/63)\) does not commit special pleading, because it does not "state that all things have a cause." What it says is that any *change* requires a cause \(where change is when something goes from potential to actual\).

This is very different from saying that *everything whatsoever* has a cause.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.3.1. Con: Stating that every change has a cause does not necessarily require a first cause, as there can be an infinite chain of causes in an infinite universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.4. Con: The properties of God defined in the OP indicate God is "totally independent of space-time" and therefore would never begin to exist or require a creator because a beginning is time-dependent. It is not special pleading to adhere to the definition of terms specified
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.5. Con: If God created time \(the existence of a beginning and an end\), then it stands to reason that God lives outside of these bounds and has no beginning nor end. Therefore it is not Special Pleading and is merely a logical characteristic of the creator of time.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.3. Con: The argument presupposes that something non-composite and immaterial can cause something material to come into existence.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.3.1. Con: The argument does not "presuppose" that something non-composite and immaterial can cause something material to come into existence, but rather the argument \(purports to\) shows that something non-composite and immaterial can cause something material.

The difference is in assuming as a premise or in accepting as a conclusion.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.4. Con: Composition is a mental abstraction. No composition can be said to be 'caused' by anything because it is not an event. Things may become stuck together or even amalgamated into something new but seeing them as a composite is a mental shift, not a change in the real world.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.5. Con: Max Tegmark's 'Mathematical Universe' argues that the foundational 'component' of composite things is mathematics, not God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.5.1. Con: The proof from composition states that composite things are caused by, not composed of, God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.6. Con: Subatomic particles form composites, including more complex subatomic particles, as well as composites known as atoms, due to natural affinities caused by natural forces according to the natural laws of physics.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.6.1. Con: These "natural forces" or "laws of physics" would then be the \(intermediate\) cause which keeps composite entities together. If the laws themselves are in some way composite, then they too require a cause. If they are not composite, then they are absolutely simple, which has been argued elsewhere to equate to God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.2.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.6.1.3. Con: Natural causes are still natural causes regardless of whether they are composite natural causes or non-composite natural causes.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.6.1.4. Con: Simply because it has been claimed elsewhere that God is absolutely simple and implied that God is the only such being, does not mean that anything absolutely simple has been shown elsewhere to equate to God. Claims are neither proof nor evidence. They are claims.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.7. Con: Changes can accumulate within a complex environment of interacting atoms and molecules. If chemicals accumulating are inorganic, then this is an example of inorganic evolution. If they are organic, then this is an example of organic evolution. If they are molecules which carry mutable information inherited by any biological organism, this accumulation of inherited change is an example of biological evolution. This explains how composites form naturally, not supernaturally.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.7.1. Con: Despite the [numerous experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller–Urey_experiment), and even assuming the conditions in which they were preformed matched the conditions of the early earth \(rather than favoring positive results\), they all failed to produce life out of lifeless matter.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8. Pro: A composite thing exists at any moment only insofar as its parts are combined at that moment.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.1. Con: Such composites can naturally form, naturally evolve, and naturally break down, but have no existence separate from their parts, so it is merely their current state and not their current existence which depends upon their current combination of parts.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2. Pro: This composition of parts requires a concurrent cause. \(It requires some outside thing or things to cause the parts to be combined.\)
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.1. Con: Not all composites require concurrent causes.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.1.1. Con: No composite entity can be named which does not require a concurrent cause or series of causes to hold it together. Thus, all composites require concurrent causes.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.1.1.1. Con: The universe is a named entity which does not require a concurrent cause.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.1.1.1.1. Con: It isn't known with certainty that the universe has no concurrent cause. Such a cause may exist and be called God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.1.1.2. Con: This sentence required non-concurrent keystrokes to be typed.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.1.1.2.1. Con: The cause of non-concurrent keystrokes is a concurrent brain state including an idea, the desire to communicate it, a plan for how to communicate it using a keyboard, and an intention to complete the plan.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2. Pro: Any composite thing has a cause of its existence at any moment during which it exists.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.1. Con: No moment to moment cause of existence is needed for a stable composite to continue existing. Both the formation of and stability of composites are well understood natural phenomena.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.1.1. Con: To the extent that a "stable composite" depends for its existence on the continued action of the laws of nature, that composite is caused from moment to moment by they continued action of the laws of nature. Thus a moment to moment cause is present in every physical composite object.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Consider the example of a simple stone at rest. The stone is a composite of many molecules, all of which are held together by the continually acting laws of chemistry.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2. Pro: Each of the things of our experience has a cause at any moment during which it exists. \(Everything we see is being caused as we see it\)
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.1. Con: Some parts of nature are very interactive and some parts of nature are very stable, but continuation of existence does not require an unchanging form. Just because something changes enough that humans might choose different labels or descriptions for it does not mean that anything ceased to exist. Composite things form and break down. These are well understood natural events, not mysterious supernatural events.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.1.1. Con: It is a red herring to mention "unchanging form" in the context of the argument from composition, because that argument makes no mention of "unchanging form."
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.1.2. Con: The argument from composition does not talk about things forming or breaking down, whether "naturally" or supernaturally. It only depends on one instant of any single composite entity existing.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2. Pro: If the cause of a composite thing's existence at any moment is itself composite, then it will in turn require a cause of its own existence at that moment.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Such claims of composites needing a cause of existence are unsubstantiated.

Changing or retaining a given form will not make something cease to exist, so claims of needing moment to moment causes of existence are nonsensical.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.1.1. Con: It is not unsubstantiated to say that composite things require a cause. In fact, the whole argument from composition purports to show why they need such a cause, and why that cause must be simple and non-composite. It will not do to merely declare the argument to be unsubstantiated without pointing out a flaw in the premise, or in the reasoning from point to point.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2. Pro: The regress of causes this entails is hierarchical in nature \(a per se causal chain\), and such a regress must therefore have a first member.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.2. Con: Such a causal chain is not a chain of caused existence but of cause change.  Change happens. Change accumulates. When change accumulates, that is called evolution. Evolution does not require a starting point but merely something in which change can accumulate.

No God required.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3. Pro: Only something absolutely simple or non-composite could in principle be the first member of such a series.

So, the existence of each of the things of our experience presupposes an absolutely simple or non-composite cause.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.1. Con: There are zero scientifically validated examples of a thinking entity which is more simple than a hydrogen atom, which is a complex composite of subatomic particles. Therefore it would be ludicrous to assume from that claim that one could logically conclude such a hypothetical first cause to be capable of thought. Therefore, it could not be a God, at least in the classical theology sense.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.1.1. Con: God is immaterial. Science confines its study and its methods to only what portions of the material world are measurable. Therefore the lack of "scientifically validated examples" is irrelevant. It is like expecting a yardstick to be able to gauge what something sounds like. Science is the wrong tool for the job of analyzing God. Science is the right tool for analyzing His creation.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.1.1.1. Con: If there is no way to measure a god then there is no reason to believe a god exists.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.2. Pro: God is this absolutely [simple or non-composite](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Divine_simplicity) cause of all composite things.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.2.1. Con: No justification is given as to why the argument determines that the non-composite entity is God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.2.2. Pro: A pure deterministic cause of everything could not produce a world with randomness. A pure random cause of everything could not produce a world with order. A pure will can produce a world with a mix of determined, random and free causes. If the absolute cause of this world is simple, then it has to be a pure will.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.2.3. Con: To define a God of classical theology to be basically the simplest thing imaginable is to define away everything that defines it as a God according to classical theology. There are no known mechanisms by which an unchanging nondescript simple thing with no moving parts can accomplish anything at all. That's not a God. It's more like an infinitesimal neutrino field without even a neutrino. Basically as close to nothing as anything can be. You might as well say God is nothing.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.2.3.1. Con: The classical definition of God historically includes [Divine Simplicity](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Divine_simplicity).
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.2.3.2. Con: [Divine Simplicity](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Divine_simplicity) implies many of the other features of God:
There can be only one absolutely simple thing. The absolutely simple thing must be unchanging \(no potentiality\). Something devoid of potentiality must inherently be immaterial, for material implies potential. Thus already we have Oneness, Unchanging, Immateriality, all common features of the classical definition of God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.2.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.5.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.2.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.2.3.3. Con: [Divine Simplicity](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Divine_simplicity) does not imply smallness. It actually implies immateriality which makes the concept of physical size inapplicable.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.2.3.4. Con: To be absolutely [simple](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Divine_simplicity) is a very different thing from nothing. Existence is absolutely contrary to non-existence. There are no "gradations" of existence. Something either exists or it does not.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.2.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.5.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.3. Con: This argument is fallacious because it assumes a single first cause instead of multiple first causes.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.2.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.3.2. Con: Ockham's razor implies that one should not unnecessarily multiply causes.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.2.2.2.3.3.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.2.2.3. Con: The evolution of a composite is merely the result of the composite accumulating changes and is a well understood process which does not require existence to be caused at each moment in time. Anything which changes has its former state and the change as the causes of its new state. No moment to moment cause of existence is needed for a composite to change or to be in its current state.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.8.3. Con: A composite can change and accumulate changes without ceasing to exist and therefore does not depend upon its combination of parts at any given moment for its existence but rather depends on its evolution for its current state.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.9. Con: Composite things are not "caused by" simpler things, but "composed of" simpler things. For example, if a human being produces a teardrop, that teardrop is composed of things which are smaller and simpler than itself but it was certainly not caused by something simpler than itself. The claim made effectively argues that God is simple and practically powerless but that there are lots of him from which to make stuff. That's not the God of classical theology.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.9.1. Con: The argument from composition does not claim that God is "practically powerless," or that there are "lots of him." The argument in fact claims that the God of classical theism, who is [absolutely simple](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Divine_simplicity), [omnipotent](https://www.infogalactic.com/info/Omnipotence), and one \(singular\), exists.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.9.1.1. Con: The claim made from an argument doesn't protect the argument from alternate or additional implications in it's structure.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.9.2. Con: The argument does not claim that composite objects are caused by simpler things, but that they are caused by simple parts being held together by some thing or things outside of the composite object.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.9.2.1. Con: Then that claim would disagree with physics, since the forces which hold such composites together are carried by the parts.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.12. Pro: [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYZ7Hz99xjE) is another formulation of the proof of God's existence from the composition of things.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.4. Con: The Cosmological arguments commit the [composition fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition).
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.6. Con: The universe and everything in it is part of an infinite cycle of probabilistic events.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.7. Con: Cosmological arguments arrive at a God that is not shown to be necessary. One could posit any sufficient entity and it would be just as valid. Universe creating pixies that disappear after creating the cosmos are just as sufficient.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.7.1. Con: Any sufficient entity, such as a universe-creating pixie, would be considered God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.7.2. Con: The Aristotelian argument from the Act/Potency divide does in fact show that a god meeting the formal definition of God, is necessary.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.9. Con: The cosmological argument involves [special pleading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading). This is granting God an unexplained exemption from the rule: all things must have a creator.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.9.1. Con: The cosmological argument doesn't have to special plead \(i.e. make an exception for God without explanation\). It claims that members of an established class of things \(observed things, moving things, etc.\) require other things to exist, not that all things do. Thus it can conclude that something outside of the class must ground the existence of all members of the class, since each member is in need of grounding by virtue of being in the class, even if it grounds other members.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.9.1.1. Con: These examples still constitute special pleading. By making all of existence one "established class" and god another, you're still making him an exception.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.10. Con: If a creator of the Universe has always existed, it has existed in infinite time prior to the Universe. That which exists in the infinite past would need infinite time to reach the present, thus it never would.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.10.1. Con: "Infinite time prior" is nonsensical. It describes something that cannot exist, and is not a part of any cosmological argument.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.10.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2.4.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.10.2. Con: God is typically understood to be outside time; to have created time. As such he has no beginning. He just is. See [Psalm 90:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2090:2)
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.10.2.1. Con: It seems an event, even a thought, requires time. It's doubtful things of the scantest duration can happen or be caused to happen in a timeless ether.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.10.2.1.1. Con: The decision to create was co-incidental with the act of creation.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.10.2.2. Con: Using a Bible reference to support a cosmological argument seems incongruous. The Bible does not accurately describe the cosmos. In Genesis 1, the cosmos is water into which the sky is centrally placed, and two great lights are placed in the sky to rule day and night \(the moon produces light\).
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.10.2.3. Con: Having God be outside of time requires us to have numerous assumptions on how that could work

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.11. Con: Cosmological arguments commit the [God of the gaps](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps) fallacy.

1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2. Pro: If the universe has a cause, the best candidate for that cause is the God of classical theism
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.1. Pro: The law of [conservation of mass](http://www.infogalactic.com/info/Conservation_of_mass) states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Given that matter does exist, and must have come into existence at some point, its cause must have broken this law and thus transcend the laws of physics. Such a cause could be considered God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.1.1. Con: Inflationary models of the universe posits a material that has a density that is "hard to dilute" \(Max Tegmark, The Mathematical Universe\). Such a material is a material with a negative pressure, which results in gravity having a repulsive effect \(instead of an attractive one\). When such a material expands, it gains mass from gravity \(under E=mc^2\).
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.1.2. Con: Conservation of mass does not imply conservation of matter since matter can be converted to and from energy. 

It is an error to claim that the law of conservation of mass is that "Matter cannot be created or destroyed." 

Therefore any argument based on such a claim is invalid.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.1.3. Con: Assuming that any massive change happened in a moment implies that natural processes had no time to take place, but there is no reason here to make such an assumption with regard to the formation of matter since science had proven that the process of matter being converted to and from energy has not in fact stopped happening.

The existence of God is not supported by the claim that "there was a moment when all of the matter in the universe came into existence", as it still happens naturally.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.1.4. Con: The event known as the Big Bang is not accurately described as "matter that was shot outward" but rather as "energetic space that rapidly expanded" and in fact evidence indicates that it still continues to expand.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.1.4.1. Pro: Well known physical phenomena such as the formation of particles from in high energy space, the emergence of virtual particles in low energy space, and Hawking radiation, are various ways that matter is known to form, without any supernatural intervention required.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.1.5. Con: We do not know where all the matter/energy and space/time originally came from. 
So one cannot claim that a God is responsible for this without arguing for \(or claiming to know\) the unknowable.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.1.5.1. Con: It does not follow that because some people believe that we do not know X, it is not possible to know X.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.1.6. Con: \>Matter/energy cannot be created or destroyed.
\>God created all of matter and energy, and this is how everything began.

This two statements contradict each other, unless you say God is just naturally omnipotent and therefore is simply just capable of doing this, but saying so contradicts the first statement. Can matter/energy be created/destroyed or can't it?
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.1.6.1. Con: These two statements do not contradict for the obvious reason that the first statement is clearly meant to apply to the laws of nature, which by definition are transcended by a supernatural God.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.1.7. Con: There are [processes](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/21/science/new-direction-in-physics-back-in-time.html?pagewanted=all) through which, in rare circumstances, matter can be created from a vacuum, or nothing, depending upon what we define as nothing.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.1.7.1. Con: These processes are still part of a physical, natural order which demands explanation.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.1.8. Con: This ignores other possibilities such as the matter always existing, a multiverse, or  any other natural or sufficient causes \(quantum fluctuations, universe creating pixies\). The conclusion that it must be God requires more evidence.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.7.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.1.8.2. Con: All of these solutions \(except pixies\) rely on the existence of a natural, physical order, which brings the question back to why such an order is in place. By definition, anything which can be the cause of the natural order is supernatural.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.4. Pro: The cause of the universe \(i.e. all time and space\) must have a will in order to be able to exist in a timeless state and act as the cause of a single universe \(or finite number of universes\).
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.4.1. Pro: A non-personal cause of the universe \(e.g. quantum vacuum fluctuation\) can only create an infinite number of universes or no universe. This is because a non-personal cause is defined such that it always acts when a set of sufficient antecedent conditions is met. In a timeless state, if those conditions are ever met, then they are always met and such a non-personal cause would generate an infinite number of universes.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.4.1.1. Con: We have no way to determine whether there are or are not infinite universes besides our own.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.4.2. Pro: Our first hand experience of our own actions evidences that while antecedent causes play a necessary and often pivotal role in the actions we take, they are not alone sufficient as in the end we must finally choose to will the actions we take, where this willing is not determined by those antecedent causes
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.4.2.1. Con: This boils down to the assertion that free will exists, with an argument that it does, and whether free will exists remains disputed.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.5. Pro: If the cause of the universe has a will, then it must be a person since there are no other candidates which possess a will
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.2.6. Pro: The cause of the universe must be timeless, spaceless, and immaterial
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3. Pro: Anything that "begins to exist" \(defined [here](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/scholarly-writings/the-existence-of-god/must-the-beginning-of-the-universe-have-a-personal-cause-a-rejoinder/) at definition A5\), must have a cause that explains how the thing came to exist
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3.1. Con: The phrase "begins to exist" cannot be adequately defined such that it applies to the universe but not to God \(see [Bobier 2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11841-013-0362-4) or this [blog](http://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/2015/08/beginning-to-exist-and-kalam.html) summarizing the paper\)
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3.2. Con: Using the above linked definition of 'begins to exist', the universe did not begin to exist. Time exists within the universe \(as a direction in spacetime\), and not the other way around. Therefore it doesn't make sense to say 'The universe exists at time t.'
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.2.2.2.2.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3.3. Con: The law of causality works within the universe, where time exists.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3.3.1. Pro: Causes and effects are events in the universe. They occur at a given time, in a given place. There is no event where and when 'The universe began to exist'.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3.3.2. Con: Cosmologists who consider multiverse theory assume that laws of causality still hold outside of our universe in the larger multiverse. In other words, they see no reason to offer a defense of the laws of causality when moving to a contexts where the laws of physics might be entirely different. This is suggestive that we all intuitively think of the law of causality as a metaphysical principle that applies to any physical reality and not just to our particular universe.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3.5. Con: There is no support for this argument beyond human intuition, and human intuition is known to be unreliable in many fields of study.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3.5.1. Con: The support for all beliefs, philosophical and scientific, eventually work their way down to fundamental intuitions for which no external evidence can be offered.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3.5.2. Con: While one can safely question/disregard the philosophical intuitions of a single person or small group of people, to give no credence to the shared philosophical intuitions of large groups of sincere thinkers, if not the majority of thinkers in this case, undermines rational inquiry.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3.5.2.1. Pro: "All things that begin to exist require a cause" is assumed true in all other other notable contexts. In other words, there is no independent case in either philosophy or science where this principle is not assumed true by the majority
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3.5.3. Con: This fails to distinguish gut reactions \(e.g. this person seems untrustworthy\) and intuitive speculation \(e.g. the stock market is going to go up\) from philosophical intuitions \(e.g. the people I experience have minds like my own\). Most evidence of "human intuition" being unreliable covers only the first two cases.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3.6. Pro: The rejection of this principle undermines science as it becomes acceptable to hypothesize that a given phenomena \(e.g. unexpected galaxy rotation curves, species distributions across continents, changes in atmospheric temperatures\) lacks a cause
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.3.5.2.1.
1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.13. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.
1.2.2.4.1.2. Con: "God exists" is not a falsifiable hypothesis, and therefore not viable to proper research. For a hypothesis to be falsifiable, there has to be a "if A were to be discovered, that would disprove the hypothesis". For the hypothesis that God doesn't exist, A could be for example an unadulterated video recording of God in his true \(distinguishable from human\) form. For the inverse hypothesis, there is no possible A where "if A is found, the hypothesis is disproven".
1.2.2.4.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.2.2.
1.2.2.4.2. Pro: In investigating a hypothesis, there is always a margin of error. In scientific research, this margin of error \(most often 5%\) is preset to determine when a result, until falsified, can be considered evidence. This means that even if you perform research in the most stringent of settings, you will have 5% false positives \(i.e. falsehoods retained as evidence\). So by that factor alone some evidence could virtually be found to support any  hypothesis, regardless of truth.
1.2.2.4.3. Con: Relational claims contingent on the character of being are not subject to strict prediction testing. E.g. I might say "If John loves Mary, John will buy her flowers," but that is only a statement of probablility, and not subject to the same predictable requirements of natural science. The same is true with the predictions we have about a personal God.
1.2.2.4.3.1. Con: The primary thesis of this discussion does not claim that the god in question is a "personal God".
1.2.2.5. Pro: Human desires, like hunger and thirst, come from the biological drive to seek something in the world \(e.g. water and food\). As there is a desire to believe in God it is likely that this desire exists because God is a real entity.
1.2.2.5.1. Con: Some people have the craving to engage in intercourse with tentacle monsters. This does not mean tentacle monsters who could satisfy this desire exist.
1.2.2.5.1.1. Con: A sexual desire suggests a sexual need. They may think that they require a "tentacle monster" but that need could be filled by a man or woman \(depending on persuasion\). Sexual needs prove the existence of something that can fulfill that need. We may be mistaken about what satisfies our need, but there is a thing of some form that will satisfy that need. It does not prove which God exists, just that a god exists in some form.
1.2.2.5.1.1.1. Con: The thing that fulfills our craving for something beyond the physical world need not be God.
1.2.2.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Even if it is not God in the sense that we see Him, the divine does in form exist. Food can not satisfy thirst, and water can not satisfy hunger. If we hunger for the divine, then the divine must exist because only the divine can satisfy it.
1.2.2.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: We could think we have some hunger for the divine, but instead just have some existential angst, or desire to know our place in a cruel, cold universe. We can misinterpret what our desires point to.
1.2.2.5.1.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.14.
1.2.2.5.1.1.2. Con: If "We may be mistaken about what satisfies our need," then we may also be mistaken that the desire to believe in god will be satisfied by a god. It may be satisfied by further understanding of the universe, or it may even be conquered as we discover that we can reprogram our thinking to realize we don't actually need a god to live our lives and be happy, morally strong citizens of the world.
1.2.2.5.2. Con: These desires can be explained in neurological terms without the existence of an unseen realm.
1.2.2.5.2.1. Con: We developed a sense of hunger because we need food. This is a neurological function yet we do not disregard the reality that food must exist. Otherwise we would not have developed a sense of hunger. Reducing something to a neurological function does not invalidate the reality of the need or desire nor the object that will satisfy it.
1.2.2.5.2.1.1. Con: We can actually sate hunger, and we developed hunger because we can sate it. On the other hand, something we seek but cannot find is not comparable.
1.2.2.5.2.1.2. Pro: The fact that we hunger for something does not suggest we will be satisfied, just that the object exists. A person stuck on an island will be hungry, but may starve to death. It is possible some people may never see God even though they have a yearning for what is beyond our world.
1.2.2.5.3. Pro: The inherent requirement and craving for God apparent in virtually every culture suggests an evolutionary benefit for acceptance of God at the least and a priori existence of God can be inferred.
1.2.2.5.3.1. Con: God was created for a craving by humans,  implying that god is only a craving and doesn't actually exist.
1.2.2.5.3.1.1. Con: C.S. Lewis pointed out in "Mere Christianity" that we thirst, and there is water. We hunger, and there is food. For every "craving" we have, there exists an object of that craving.

It is illogical to believe that we have a craving for something that does not exist. Far from being evidence that God does not exist, mankind's craving to know his creator is evidence that our Creator is there.
1.2.2.5.3.2. Con: The selection pressure to conform to religious belief / practice was man-made through punishment, isolation, and other disadvantages. This had nothing to do with God's existence.
1.2.2.5.3.3. Con: If anything, this evolutionary benefit would imply that only those who have a tendency to be gullable or compliant are more likely to survive, this can in no way be considered to be real, acceptable evidence for the existence of God.
1.2.2.5.3.4. Con: Humans evolved to be superstitious, because this conferred a survival benefit.  This does not mean everyone's superstitious—be they God-shaped or not—are real.
1.2.2.5.3.5. Con: The "Requirement and craving for God" is more likely a craving for understanding of the unknown, which is then filled with a created "God" because it is convenient to give the answer: "God made it that way," and be satisfied.
1.2.2.5.3.6. Con: With each generation indoctrinating the next well before critical thinking develops, it becomes ingrained, and is as much cultural as religious. It is a "requirement," especially in religiously homogeneous regions. The existence of a tradition alone, does not prove its worth, or that it is logical.
1.2.2.5.4. Con: The cravings for something beyond the physical are not universal in the way hunger and thirst are universal.  Their absence have no verifiable ill effects on those lacking them.  This is seen in interviews of atheists and agnostics who feel no particular spiritual drive and none the less lead perfectly fulfilling, happy lives.
1.2.2.5.5. Con: That "something beyond the physical exists" does not necessarily equate to "God."
1.2.2.5.6. Con: The analogy between food and spiritual desires is weak, which invalidates the argument.

The desire for food and the desire for something "beyond the physical world" are too dissimilar.
1.2.2.5.6.1. Pro: Food is needed for subsistence while something "beyond the physical world" is a convenient explanation for how the world works \(or for what happens after death\).
1.2.2.5.6.2. Pro: Desire for food is seen throughout the animal kingdom while the desire for something "beyond the physical world" is seen only in humans.
1.2.2.5.7. Con: Biological drives evolve because the drive itself provides a survival benefit. That benefit need not be tied to the physical existence of something. Otherwise, all superstitions would be real.
1.2.2.5.8. Con: Evolved characteristics can be superfluous or be misused.
1.2.2.5.8.1. Pro: A dog licks it's wounds even when it is [incorrect](https://www.petmd.com/blogs/dailyvet/2009/december/07-5101) to do so.
1.2.2.5.8.2. Pro: Cancer is a case of misuse of evolutionary traits \(such as cell growth, replication, irrigation\).
1.2.2.5.9. Con: Paul Kurtz argued that because nature is full of chaos and impermanence, it can cause great unease. Some seek to counter that with something stable and eternal. This is what "God" gives them; he's a safe harbor in a storm.
1.2.2.5.10. Con: Deducing God must have been there because some people search for Him is like deducing thirst creates water without ever having seen any water. \([Post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc)\)
1.2.2.5.11. Con: This argument is perfect example of confirmation bias.
1.2.2.6. Con: According to most God beliefs, God is described as a separate entity that exists outside of time and space.  Such a claim can never be demonstrated as true by its own definition, since we can only demonstrate things that exist in time and space.
1.2.2.6.1. Con: In the Judeo-Christian tradition while God transcends time and space he can be manifest in time and space as made explicit in the incarnation of the Son of God.
1.2.2.6.2. Con: The laws of logic transcend time and space, yet we must use them to make a claim on this board. This defeats the idea that "we can only demonstrate things that exist in time and space".
1.2.2.6.2.1. Con: The laws of logic describe things we know to be true. 'The universe does not conform to logical absolutes because someone thought them up and is holding reality to that standard. These absolutes exist [purely to describe patterns that we have observed as true in reality](http://www.atheistrepublic.com/blog/arminnavabi/do-laws-logic-prove-existence-god)' \(in time and space\).
1.2.2.6.2.1.1. Con: Because the described patterns exist in time and space does not imply that the laws of logic exist in time and space.
1.2.2.6.3. Con: The existence of a thing that does not exist in time and space can be inferred. It can also be used as the basis of entirely real world physical constructions. The square root of minus 1, for example, has no physical reality, yet as a concept, is required in the construction of [electric circuits](https://www.quora.com/in/What-are-the-main-practical-uses-of-i) \(and therefore most machines\).
1.2.2.7. Con: The existence or non-existence of God cannot be established through the scientific process.
1.2.2.7.1. Con: The existence or non-existence of any being can be established as much as anything else. God is not a special case in that sense. There have been various testable predictions about God and they have failed.
1.2.2.7.1.1. Pro: [Prayer studies](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/health/31pray.html) are evidence that a God who intervenes to answer prayers does not exist.
1.2.2.7.1.1.1. Con: It was said, that it wasn't sure how much prayers did control group get from family and friends, therefore it is hard to determine whether there wasn't possible impact of prayer on that group.
1.2.2.7.1.1.2. Con: Not necessarily. This claim is based on the premise that if God exists, He would by necessity answer to prayers in a prayer study, which is not self-evident.
1.2.2.7.1.1.2.1. Pro: This study shows that God to which people adress preyers doesn't intervene, not that there is no such God - they might have been praying to the wrong one.
1.2.2.7.1.1.3. Con: There are well documented cases of [scientifically inexplicable recoveries after prayer](http://www.is-there-a-god.info/life/tenhealings/).
1.2.2.7.1.2. Pro: [Biological evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) demonstrates that a God that directly created [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve#Historicity), animals and plants does not exist.
1.2.2.7.1.3. Pro: According to [1 Kings 18:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%2018:24) God would answer in very specific ways when you call on his name.
1.2.2.7.1.4. Pro: According to the [Mark 16:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16%3A18&version=NIV) if God existed people who believed in Him would be able to drink deadly poison and not be hurt at all. That has been [demonstrated false](http://www.pulse.ng/gist/5-church-members-die-after-pastor-made-them-drink-rat-poison-id6253951.html).
1.2.2.7.1.4.1. Con: Not everything included in Bible is literal in eyes of every Christian. Therefore proving that some fragment is not literaly true is not enough to show that main thoughts of Bible are false.
1.2.2.7.1.4.2. Con: Even if it would prove the non-existence of Christian God it is not a proof for the non-existence of a classical God, which is the topic of this discussion.
1.2.2.7.1.4.3. Con: The linked incident does not meet the conditions that are described in Mark. Notably, they violate scriptures [prohibiting tempting the Lord](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Matthew-4-7/), or attempting to make Him perform just to see a miracle \(Matthew 4:7\).
1.2.2.7.1.4.4. Con: Acording to [Luke 17:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+17%3A6&version=NIV) if we would have faith as a mustard seed we could move mountains; even greatest saints haven't done that, therefore it is hard to determine whether people included have enough faith.
1.2.2.7.1.5. Con: There are mathematical theories which prove that some theories can't be proven nor disproven. Same could apply to some establishing existence of some being.
1.2.2.7.1.5.1. Pro: [Undecidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem?wprov=sfla1) problems cannot be solved.
1.2.2.7.2. Pro: The broad world-view establishes and limits the uses of Occam's razor vis the problem. [Gray, Scott David \(2017\), Musings on the Limitations of Science](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ruEIedns9d3Df902EDR2gWvzPRvjhRvlqSHn1LG770I/edit)
1.2.2.7.2.1. Con: Source cited appears to be unreliable.
1.2.2.7.2.2. Con: Occam's razor does not depend on a persons view, but on the number of required assumptions.
1.2.2.7.3. Pro: Even if we could prove everything logically, then still there is place for God. There would be no faith without doubt, so God could have created world in such way that finding proof for his existence is impossible, to give us possibility of believing - not knowing for sure.
1.2.2.7.4. Pro: Science has room for the unknown, and certain metaphysical issues are resistant / inaccessible to scientific investigation.
1.2.2.7.4.1. Pro: Every supposed act of God / miracle etc. could be interpreted as something not yet understood from a scientific perspective. Neither side could disprove the other, because of the limitations of our scientific knowledge, which would always be present.
1.2.2.7.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.2.2.
1.2.2.7.4.2. Pro: As a fully metaphysical being, God is out of bounds of physics, which could suggest that he is also out of bounds of any other scientifical, even logical, bounds.
1.2.2.7.4.2.1. Con: "Out of bounds of physics" means not being able to have an effect on anything in the universe.
1.2.2.7.5. Pro: Claims about God have to be falsifiable before they can be experimentally tested. [Falsifiability in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability?wprov=sfla1)
1.2.2.7.5.1. Con: Infinitely many claims are infalsifiable. Assuming they are not true is pragmatic.
1.2.2.7.5.1.1. Con: Assuming the claims as false gives such claims more credibility than they actually deserve.
1.2.2.7.5.2. Pro: Unfalsifiable claims are neither true nor false. ["It is not even wrong"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong?wprov=sfla1)
1.2.2.7.6. Pro: There is no demonstrable scientific evidence that proves the presence of God, not the existence of God. God, by His nature, is transcendent, which will therefore render the scientific method as futile.
1.2.2.8. Pro: The existence of self aware life is scientific evidence that God exists.
If God did not exist, the fact that 14 billion years of physics can produce life out of an ocean of 'conscious-less' hydrogen and energy is evidence that consciousness is either a fundamental characteristic of the universe, or an emergent property. In the former case, the universe is God. In the latter case, the universe can create God.
1.2.2.8.1. Con: Actually in the latter case, the universe has the ability to create consciousness \(not necessarily "God"\) via "emergence."
1.2.2.8.2. Con: The classical definition of God, which is used in this discussion, holds that God is uncreated.
1.2.2.8.2.1. Con: No, it says that God is a absolutely metaphysically ultimate being. That does not preclude such a God creating itself.
1.2.2.8.2.1.1. Con: A being that exists is greater than a being that is identical in every way, but with the sole exception of being non-existent.

 If it is possible for God to exist, but at any point He does not \(both of which must be true if God created Himself\), then God, when he did not exist was not an absolutely metaphysically ultimate being. Therefore, by definition, existence is entailed in the concept of an absolutely metaphysically ultimate being.
1.2.2.8.2.1.2. Con: The idea of X creating X is a logical impossibility.
1.2.2.8.2.1.2.1. Pro: Existence is required for an actor to act.
1.2.2.8.3. Con: A trans-personal reality \(God\) can not be found out by a personal reality \(Human Being\), unless a person has lived a trans-personal experience.
1.2.2.8.4. Pro: There's no logical reason to think that human brain capacities are the limit, therefore it is logical to think that a much more powerful brain exists, and this being would be equivalent to the concept of God.
1.2.2.8.4.1. Con: This is a bit of a non sequitur. It doesn't follow that, because it is possible for a brain to exist beyond human capabilities, that such a brain actually exists.
1.2.2.8.4.2. Con: It doesn't follow that, because it is possible for a brain to exist beyond human capabilities, and that such a brain does exist, that this brain must be God. If this same statement is considered from a gerbil's perspective, it becomes apparently false, as human brain capabilities far exceed that of rodents, yet we are not God.
1.2.2.9. Con: A reason to believe that god exist is not an evidence of so. Such reason can be defined as a mere "hole" in the scientific theory that need to be scientifically filled, not religiously.
This can be easily seen in the evolution of politheistic religion, in which every deity had a "power" \(Zeus-\>lightning, Apollo-\>Sun\) that were easily eradicated with the comprehension of the real world through science.
1.2.2.10. Pro: Science can easily prove the existence of a world that we can not see. Digital objects can have substance without being physical \(like the code that defines the substance of this page, for example\).
1.2.2.10.1. Con: There is physical substance to digital objects - electrons or charged particles in computer's processor. But even if there was a proof of something withou any substance, that does not support the existence of anythig else.
1.2.2.10.2. Con: This has not be done for a god.
1.2.2.11. Pro: The second law of thermodynamics has no known exceptions. The claim that the universe can bring the order we see around us from the disorder of the big bang is incompatible with this law.[www.personal.psu.edu](http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/m/jmc6/second_law.html)
1.2.2.11.1. Pro: The second law of thermodynamics indicates that the universe is running out of usable energy. If the universe had existed for an infinite number of past days, then all usable energy should have disappeared long ago.
1.2.2.11.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.
1.2.2.11.1.2. Con: Scientists do not claim that the universe has existed for an infinite number of past days. The current estimate is about [13.8 billion years](https://www.space.com/24054-how-old-is-the-universe.html).
1.2.2.11.2. Con: Entropy is not exactly a measure of disorder. Instead, it is a measure of the possible microstates of the system. The entropy of the early universe was lower than today, perfectly in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics: [www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/04/15/ask-ethan-what-was-the-entropy-of-the-universe-at-the-big-bang/#427aa5757280)
1.2.2.12. Pro: -> See discussion #10223: Faith and Science Can Co-exist
1.2.2.13. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.12.
1.2.2.14. Con: The fact that faith wholly underpins the belief in god, suggests that scientific evidence is not available to support it, or faith would not be required.
1.2.2.15. Con: Most claims the God exists posit something that has human like characteristics. The nature of the universe we see doesn't look like anything that would be created by a human. Therefore what most people conceive of as God probably doesn't exist.
1.2.3. Con: There are many claims of evidence of the handiwork of God, but no actual evidence that anything is God's handiwork as opposed to naturally formed or the handiwork of something other than God.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Nothing can be held to exist until it is proven to exist. There is no categorical proof that God does exist, so we cannot state that “God Exists.” The noun, God, boils down to the name given to the cause of the what where when why and how of the Universe. Scientists ponder over all aspects of the Universe and dream of one day finding a theory of everything. God is the precursor to The Theory of Everything.
1.2.4. Pro: Testimonial evidence supports the existence of God.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Testimonial evidence is used in courts of law to establish facts beyond reasonable doubt.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: In a court of law testimonial evidence is rarely accepted by itself.
Testimonial evidence will be rejected when the claim is extraordinary or outside of our normal understanding of physics.
No eyewitness is going to be accepted in a court of law for something like resurrection that would require something like specialist medical expertise.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: Testimonial evidence is acceptable on its own if there are many independent reliable witnesses, and if the testimony includes facts that can be established objectively.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con: If it is accepted with many other statements, then it isn't on its own.
1.2.4.1.1.2. Con: Judges will accept testimony that doesn't not have a scientific explanation if it has been undeniably witnessed, since they are bound only by fact and not constrained to the scientific method. Judges accept that minds exist, for example.
1.2.4.1.1.3. Con: Specialists medical experts are not needed to know that crucified men don't come alive.
1.2.4.1.1.3.1. Con: They might be needed to ascertain whether or not a person was actually dead.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: This claim is highly country dependent, some court of law will give more value to witness testimony than the other.
1.2.4.2. Pro: The best psychological explanation for [Christian martyrdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_martyrs) is that God exists.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: The best psychological explanation for Christian Martyrdom is that people sometimes voluntarily make sacrifices in the name of strongly held community beliefs. 
This also explains phenomena like young men going to war, [government officials sticking to their posts during a Japanese Tsunami](https://listverse.com/2013/01/15/the-top-10-most-inspiring-self-sacrifices/) and parents insisting on female circumcision in their daughters.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: People don't die for beliefs that are verifiably false, where admitting the truth would save their life.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Existence of God is not verifiably false. That's why this dscussion exists in the first place.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: For those present in first-century Jerusalem, the resurrection of Jesus was much more verifiable than it is today.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The earliest Christians claimed to have seen Jesus alive after the crucifixion.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The earliest Christians could have visited the tomb \(as they did, according to the Bible\), or asked the Chief Priest to view the body.
1.2.4.2.1.2. Pro: There are many types of martyrdom with religious martyrdom being only one type. There is no reason to believe that the reasons for religious martyrdom differ from reasons for other type of martyrdoms.
1.2.4.2.1.3. Con: Whilst people are often willing to die for what they believe, people are unlikely to die for what they know is not true. The early martyrs would have known whether Jesus had resurrected or not, and could have saved their lives by simply saying that it had not happened. It is psychologically improbable that multiple people were willing to die for such a readily verifiable false belief.
1.2.4.2.1.3.1. Con: The stories about early martyrs might not be true.
1.2.4.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: History is written by the victors. The stories of early martyrs might have been "improved" in order to paint the whole religion in a better light.
1.2.4.2.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: People have a psychological [inclination to root for the underdogs](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-big-questions/201006/the-appeal-the-underdog). Stories of extreme martyrdom and great deeds inspire devotion and sympathy.
1.2.4.2.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Christianity has plenty of examples of early Christian cowards \(Peter\), people slow to understand \(the disciples\) and other embarrassing testimony. It is not a movement that seems to recast it's characters as heroes. Peter was called "Satan" by Jesus. The disciples fled in terror while the women were found at the cross and were the first to the tomb... in a society that did not value women or their testimony! The only "hero" in the story is Jesus himself.
1.2.4.2.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: The narrative of "bad" turning into "good" with Christianity as a catalyst of that change is one of the central parts of Christian lore and teaching. The existence of said examples does not contest the possibility of existence of embellished martyrdom stories.
1.2.4.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: Stories often embellish the truth and exaggerate, mainly if their main purpose is to spread a message or persuade someone.
1.2.4.2.1.3.2. Con: Only Saint Stephen \(34 AD\) and James, son of Zebedee \(44 AD\) were near in time the to reported resurrection, and they were not witnesses. Their knowledge of the resurrection wouldn't have been much better, if at all, of those who came later. Stephen's death does not appear to be voluntary. He angered a crowd of Jews while preaching to them, and they killed him.
1.2.4.2.1.3.3. Con: As the martyrs were not witnesses, they heard of the resurrection second hand. There seems no way to readily verify if they were deceived or not.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: A strongly held belief that God was real would be as motivating as God being actually real.
1.2.4.2.2.1. Con: In the case of the 11 faithful apostles, this is obviously not what happened. In their case, they were in a place to know what happened. They were eyewitnesses. Yet to a man, they never recanted their story, even in the faith of persecution and death. To believe 11 men maintained a lie for decades, even to their own disadvantage, is illogical and unreasonable.
1.2.4.2.3. Con: There are a number of [other explanations](http://uo-martyrs.weebly.com/psychology.html) for martyrdom, including a steady desensitisation and role modelling by authority figures.
1.2.4.2.4. Con: If I am willing to suffer or die for something, it does not mean that that something is right or true. It means that I believe it is.
1.2.4.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.3.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Testimonial evidence is the chief tool of the apostles.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: Witness testimony is the lowest form of evidence, both in the court room and in scientific inquiry. In fact, the reliance on testimony is one of the major weaknesses of the notion that God exists.
1.2.4.3.2. Con: Prior to Emperor Constantine there were only [21 books that Christians could agree on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Christian_biblical_canon#Development_of_the_New_Testament_canon). 10 others were disputed and some labelled heresy. The [Council of Nicea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea) wasn't called until 325CE and the canon's completion took until [397CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament). Many of the books that went into the finished product were fabricated, the alleged authors centuries dead. Only the original 21 books stand any chance of being at all authentic.
1.2.4.4. Con: Testimonial evidence has been already proved to be unreliable. Not only people can lie but also hallucinate, have memory distortion etc. Testimonials are far from being a scientific evidence.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: The concept of evidence in general relies on the perception of the individual perceiving it. Peer reviewed science is subject to the same flaws, so either our perception is reliable, or it isn't; But saying that we can't trust testimonial accounts would undermine all efforts, religious or not, to understand the universe and/or it's creator.
1.2.4.4.1.1. Con: The scientific method is not based on testimony, it is based on data collection, and testable theories. If repeated tests illicit the same results, we accept it as a truth, i.e. I drop something and it falls to the ground. That is not a testimony because you could perform the same test and get the same result.
1.2.4.4.2. Con: This claim is itself "testimonial evidence", and therefore, by its own standard, is proven unreliable. Whether the claimant is lying, hallucinating that they've seen evidence to support their assertion, or just remember the evidence incorrectly is unknown. 

Even so, the claimant is providing testimony regarding the unreliability of testimony. As such, the claim can be disregarded, as either incorrect, or unreliable.
1.2.4.4.3. Pro: The game / experiment [Chinese Whispers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers) easily show how unreliable a testimony can be.
1.2.4.5. Pro: Taking large doses of [DMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine) provides the journeyman an exploration of consciousness and an unprecedented  understanding of reality that can only be presumed to have been designed by a greater being.
1.2.4.5.1. Con: Just because an understanding is unprecedented, does not make it correct.
1.2.4.5.2. Con: This claim refers to a psychedelic hallucinogen that induces varying results which is hardly reliable evidence in a testable setting.
1.2.4.5.3. Con: People under the influence of DMA have yet to create equally valid evidence while sober.
1.2.4.6. Con: A testimony is not worth much without supporting tangible or testable evidence.
1.2.4.7. Pro: Witness testimonies of new life offer the best evidence of an active loving God
1.2.4.8. Con: There are human experiences \('divine moments', 'spiritual moments', moments of ultimate joy, serenity or peace\) that can easily be attributed to a god but can also be explained in other, more rational ways. It is not necessary to attribute these experiences, which might just be biological processes and "epiphanies" in our brains, to a superior being.
1.2.4.9. Con: Testimonial evidence supports the existence of [Flying Spaghetti Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster), [Yeti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti), [Chupacabra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chupacabra) and many others.
1.2.4.9.1. Pro: According to [Russell's teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot) argument, the burden of proof for testimonial evidence lies with the party making the claim, not the party refusing it. No definitive or testifiable proof has been provided by any religion so far.
1.2.4.9.1.1. Con: If Russell's teapot says that the burden of proof lies on the party making the claim, then produce someone who can prove the existence of the FSM. Testimonial  evidence will be accepted ... but everyone knows that the FSM is a parody, so it is rejected.
1.2.4.9.2. Con: No one has ever given testimony in support of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. People who "believe" in the FSM have openly and knowingly stated that it is a parody. The Yeti, Chupacabra, Loch Ness Monster, etc. are all within the realm of possibility but highly unlikely.
1.2.4.10. Pro: Demons exist and can be [exorcised](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/07/01/as-a-psychiatrist-i-diagnose-mental-illness-and-sometimes-demonic-possession/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d73ad79e5bcf). Something more powerful than demons must exist, which is likely God.
1.2.5. Pro: The existence of Christianity supports the existence of God.
1.2.5.1. Pro: It is highly unlikely that anyone would have become a Christian in the first century without good reason to believe that Jesus had risen from the dead.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: The founders and early adopters of Christianity faced lose of prestige, possessions, and even death for their belief. Without good reason to believe that Jesus actually rose from the dead, Christianity would not have been widely adopted with these deterrents.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Christianity did the same thing to Pagans and other religions during the Crusades, and they refused to change their beliefs and were slaughtered for it as well. So if Christianity was that much more true than any other religion, everyone would have converted. It seems it is just harder to shake a belief system once it takes hold, than it is to prove one specific belief system.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1. Con: The above claim explains why people would hold onto their beliefs in the face of adversity, but it fails to explain why people would choose to abandon their beliefs in favor of Christianity while it was still new and persecuted; it fails to address the point of its parent claim.
1.2.5.1.2. Con: Many people become Christian because their parents are Christian.
1.2.5.1.2.1. Con: While this is true, to assert that this invalidates the claim is a [Genetic Fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/genetic).
1.2.5.1.3. Con: Jesus' resurrection is unconvincing evidence for God as it is unlikely that the resurrection occurred.
1.2.5.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.6.
1.2.5.1.3.2. Pro: The story of the resurrection is at odds with reality as we know it. It being so wildly contradictory with our collective experience that it would require an incredible miracle \(not even a garden variety one\) to be true is reason enough to be nigh certain that it did not occur \(at least the way it is claimed in biblical texts\).
1.2.5.1.3.2.1. Con: A miracle is, by definition, an extremely rare event. Each miracle claim must be evaluated on its own merits. Stating that miracles don't conform to our normal experiences is simply a recognition of the nature of miracles, not a refutation of them.
1.2.5.1.3.2.1.1. Con: All claims of miracles are unlikely to be true a priori by their very classification. On their own merits, only claims that can be shown to be true with sufficient certainty to counter that a priori likelihood of being false should be accepted \(and people's testimony is not extremely strong evidence\).
1.2.5.1.3.2.1.2. Con: Rare events are not evidence of the existence of God.
1.2.5.1.3.2.2. Con: A miracle is, by necessity, an extremely rare event. If the purpose of a miracle is to communicate something from a transcendent God to humanity, then the event must be something that is inexplicable by any naturalistic means; otherwise, we would simply accept it as a natural event.
1.2.5.1.3.2.2.1. Con: A communication would be more successful if it was plausible that it happened. As it stands it is implausible.
1.2.5.1.3.2.3. Con: The recognition that the resurrection is more than just a "garden variety" miracle acknowledges that this singular event is the most important communication of God to mankind.
1.2.5.1.3.2.3.1. Con: The lack of supporting evidence for such singular event calls into question whether it happened.
1.2.5.1.3.2.3.2. Con: Rather than acknowledging that such an event existed in contradiction with all other real events, it reasonably demonstrates that such an event did not happen.
1.2.5.1.3.3. Pro: The resurrection account is very weak evidence since the claim is a matter of individual revelation \(even though it was several of Jesus' disciples who may have made the claim\).

[Individual revelation](https://www.hidabroot.com/video/177507/Rabbi-Lawrence-Kelemen/A-Rational-Approach-to-the-Torahs-Divine-Origin) \(from 12:00 to 12:40\) has an extremely low value \(near 0%\) as scientific evidence. The evidence relies on whether we believe the disciples of Jesus not.
1.2.5.1.3.4. Pro: Views on the afterlife. The Sadducees said there was none. The Essenes said it was spirit only, no body. The Pharisees \(Jesus\) believed in the "resurrection" which was body & spirit. The spirit lived on after death, but the faithful would get their body back at the end-times for use in heaven. This was a belief they held that was likely embellished or mistranslated.
1.2.5.1.4. Con: People frequently have bizarre beliefs that they are convinced are true and are willing to sacrifice for the belief. Early Christianity argued about the resurrection and Virgin birth. It was a council of men in 325 that decided current Christian dogma. A social psychological study in 1950s followed people who gave up jobs and school because they strongly believed the world was about to end. They joined a cult of true believers..much like the early Christians.
1.2.5.1.5. Con: Christianity was highly fractured in the first century. The New Testament was assembled over time and was not complete by the First Council of Nicea in 325 AD, when the trinity was adopted. Some groups believed in a divine, yet non-resurrected Jesus.
1.2.5.2. Con: The existence of a mythology does not inherently support the existence of the gods in said mythology. If that were the case, you would have to acknowledge the existence of Zeus, Ra, Shiva, Odin, etc. alongside the Christian God. The existence of those gods would then render the claim of the Christian God being the only god or "one true god" a falsehood.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: Jesus’s ressurection, proof of God, is separated from myth by a number of historical facts that are required for Christianity to have become as widespread as it is.
1.2.5.2.1.1. Con: Christianity isn't all that widespread.
1.2.5.2.1.2. Con: Many ancient myths were also based in historical fact, or at least what was perceived as fact. The only fundamental difference between 'Myth' and 'Religion' is the amount of people currently practicing it.
1.2.5.2.1.2.1. Pro: When the Pagans were all but wiped out by the Catholics, their faith died with them. The same is true for the Ancient Romans, Greeks, and Egyptians. No one believes those stories anymore, yet at the time they were held as truths. In another 1,000 or 2,000 years from now, if Christianity gives way to another religion, it will also be viewed as a mythology.
1.2.5.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.3.
1.2.5.2.1.4. Pro: The tomb was empty.
1.2.5.2.1.4.1. Pro: The Jewish leaders who had Jesus killed took measures to ensure the body of Christ could not be stolen.
1.2.5.2.1.5. Pro: The deciples bore testimony to having witnessed the resurrected Jesus along with many others. They bore this testimony even at the cost of their lives.
1.2.5.2.1.5.1. Pro: The deciples had no reasonable motivation to lie about having witnessed the resurrected Jesus.
1.2.5.2.1.5.1.1. Con: They may very well have witnessed Jesus, who had nearly died, and returned having narrowly escaped death.
1.2.5.2.2. Pro: The concept of God/s has changed through time reflecting cultures and cultural understandings.  A particular concept of God/s that arose in a definite place and time \(within history\) cannot be separated from its circumstances.  We might as well argue whether Odin exists or Artemis or Ahura Mazda.  God \(YHWH\) is merely one more cultural artifact.
1.2.5.2.2.1. Pro: There are as many concepts of God as cultures, but are "models" \(approximations\) of God adapted to the reality of each culture / depend on each culture. The reality of God must be beyond / beneath the cultures.
1.2.5.2.3. Con: A continued strong and active belief in God in spite of extreme persecution over centuries is not the same as a continued knowledge that a people group once believed something, such as in the case of Greek or other mythology. Those belief systems essentially died out and simply became part of history when they went out of political/social favor.
1.2.5.3. Con: That is just an [argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) \(a [fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies), an error in reasoning that even has its own name\).
1.2.5.3.1. Con: This is not argumentum ad populum, since it does not refer to modern Christians, but to the apostoles and other early followers, who knew Jesus personally. Thus, it is a historical argument. Using a relation of witnesses and pointing out that these witnesses had nothing to gain by lying is not the same as using ad populum.
1.2.5.4. Pro: The earliest Christians were Jews who had nothing \(worldly\) to gain and much to lose by abandoning Judaism to follow Jesus. Something powerful must have happened in their lives to convince them that a crucified carpenter was their promised Messiah.
1.2.5.4.1. Pro: The Jews already believed they were "God's chosen people" and were destined for Heaven.  Early Christians risked being ostracized from society and alienated from their families to become followers of the Way.
1.2.5.4.2. Pro: [Jesus was made a curse](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3&version=NKJV) \(v13\) \(or accursed\) when he was crucified by gentiles. The Jews of that day [found it hard to believe](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+1&version=NKJV) \(v23\) in a crucified, suffering messiah. It would have taken a lot of evidence to convince a self-respecting Jew to follow such a man.
1.2.5.4.3. Con: Just because early Jesus followers believed he was the messiah, doesn't mean he actually was.
1.2.5.4.4. Con: By this logic every other religion and God is as true as Christianity. There were always people switching faiths, it proves or disproves nothing, the point is moot.
1.2.5.4.4.1. Con: The point is not moot, the point is that, generally, people will not die for what they know to be a lie. People changing faiths has no bearing on the idea that early Christians would have known the truth and wouldn’t have willingly died if they knew it was fake.
1.2.5.5. Con: God was active with humanity in the Bible.  If he exists he should still be active.
1.2.5.6. Pro: The existence of the Bible, as the word of God, provides evidence for the existence of God.
1.2.5.6.1. Pro: There is a circular pattern of 12 in Bible & universe that shows the existence of God by order & design, purpose, and connectivity to God's Word the Bible.  \(I will work on a link\).
1.2.5.6.1.1. Con: The human brain is very good at pattern recognition, so good, that we often see patterns that are meaningless or coincidental.
1.2.5.6.2. Con: It has not been demonstrated that the Bible is the word of any god.
1.2.5.6.3. Pro: God's nature is literally that of "The Word"; as evidenced by John 1:1.
Because the word "God" exists, God exists.
1.2.5.6.3.1. Con: The word "dragon" exists; this doesn't mean that dragons exists in reality.
1.2.5.6.4. Con: This is circular reasoning.  You cannot use scripture to prove itself legitimate.
1.2.5.6.4.1. Con: This claim is not about the Bible claiming it is true. It is about the Bible containing scientific facts and ethical principles which are ahead of their time and predictions of the future which can reasonably be explained by devine inspritation.
1.2.5.6.5. Con: God makes a number of appearances in the Old Testament right up until writing is invented, and the stories are set out. After that, He never appears before men again.
1.2.5.6.5.1. Con: Writing was invented 3000 BC, which is well before the events of Exodus where the Bible claims that God appeared to Moses.
1.2.5.6.6. Con: The Bible exists, but much of its authorship is unknown, even as to the New Testament. Without knowing the authors, we can never know what their motivations were for writing it.
1.2.5.6.6.1. Con: No matter what the authorship is, it is the content of the Bible that speaks for itself.
1.2.5.6.7. Pro: The Bible contains ethical and sometimes even scientific principles which are far ahead of their time. \(e.g. Exodus 20:12; Leviticus 11:28; Deuteronomy 22:25; Job 26:7; Matthew 5:44; Galatians 3:28\)
1.2.6. Con: No peer-reviewed articles in any reputable scholarly journal have ever provided evidence for the existence of God\(s\). The claim that God exists is a claim about the nature of reality, and must be judged by the same standards as other claims about the nature of reality.
1.2.6.1. Con: Scientific peer reviewed journals are written by scientists, who by necessity \(and correctly\) perform their research under the assumption of methodological naturalism. Thus supernatural explanation is ruled out as a first principle. Inference to supernatural explanation is a philosophical question, which science, for better or worse, rules out by definition.
1.2.6.1.1. Con: While true, the claim in no way shows that it is improper to use the conclusions of scientific research as evidence for non-scientific conclusions. Nor is it improper to use certain non-scientific conclusions as scientific evidence.
1.2.6.1.1.1. Pro: The "scientific method" is not derived from science. Indeed, it could not be, for that would mean that it existed before it was derived. Therefore, science itself is based on a philosophical, not a scientific foundation.
1.2.6.2. Con: Peer reviewed article on the effects of prayer:[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20686441)
1.2.6.3. Con: Scientific research can only be used on the observable universe and can only indirectly prove in God's existence.
1.2.7. Con: There is no proverbial "smoking gun." At best, the evidence is circumstantial. In truth it is highly subjective, because no one has ever produced evidence of God that lends itself to only one interpretation.
1.2.8. Con: In fact there are no physical or materialistic evidences that one can see that supports existence of God. All "evidences" are actually either claims or feelings.
1.2.9. Pro: There are probabalistic suggestions that God exists
1.2.9.1. Pro: The Modern Synthesis of Evolution implies that it is highly likey that intent was present for the creation of animals because the alternate "random" mutation of genes detailed in evolutionary theory makes the evolution of organisms as complex as they are highly improbable [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283604007624) [witpress.com](https://www.witpress.com/elibrary/dne-volumes/4/2/399) \(from [www.kialo.com](https://www.kialo.com/argument/2629.5756)\)
1.2.9.1.1. Con: The concept of "specified complexity" is [disputed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specified_complexity#Criticisms)
1.2.9.1.2. Con: The evolution of organisms as complex as humans is necessitated by the [anthropic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle); the possible worlds where nothing intelligent enough to observe things as we do evolved, do not include any observations of how complex or simple life on Earth is.
1.2.9.2. Con: The [Kolmogorov complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity) of the God hypothesis is very high
1.2.10. Con: Throughout the history of mankind we have attributed every event that we didn't understand to God, while the safest answer to those should simply be "we don't understand", as chances are those event justifying the existence of God will eventually find a scientific explanation.
1.2.10.1. Pro: Our ancestors used to think natural events like thunder was an evidence of God.
1.3. Pro: Revelation through faithful practices and religious experiences support the existence of God.
1.3.1. Con: Because it's impossible for anyone to know that God exists unless they are God, there is no reason to believe in the existence of God.
1.3.1.1. Con: God can know that He exists and He can tell that to others.
1.3.1.2. Con: Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta teach that all life is the part of the Absolute, making it possible to know that for sure by self-realization.
1.3.1.3. Con: The argument that only God can know if God exists or not is a form of [radical skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_skepticism), which should be rejected.
1.3.2. Pro: In order to know God, one must believe that God exists while engaging in faithful practice.
1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See discussion #5496: One should believe that God exists, even if they are not sure it's true.
1.3.2.2. Pro: There are pragmatic reasons to believe in the existence of God.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: Pragmatism is irrelevant to philosophy and truth. There are many inconvenient truths.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: Illusions can have pragmatic reasons. Convenience doesn't support the veracity of the argument.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: There are pragmatic reasons not to believe in God as well.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: Such reasons include not having to follow set-in-stone rituals that use up one's time and energy \(e.g. prayer five times a day for islam, shabbath for judaism, church on sunday for christianism, and many others \)
1.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: People don't have to feel guilty for normal behaviours such as \(but not restricted to\) masturbation or out-of-wedlock-sex; indeed religions tend to shame such practices whereas they are actually [normal and healthy](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/masturbation-the-health-benefits-10252487.html). The guilt that such activities bring can prevents people from doing them, or cause mental distress when people do.
1.3.2.2.2.3. Pro: One can eat whatever one wants \(beef is forbidden in the major branches of Hinduism, meat in general in some branches, pork in Islam and Judaism\), whenever one wants \(Ramadan in Islam, Lent in Christianity\), [unlike](https://www.britannica.com/topic/dietary-law/Rules-and-customs-in-world-religions) many religions.
1.3.2.2.3. Pro: Many people believe in God. To them it seems it exists.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.1.7.
1.3.2.2.3.2. Con: Believing in something doesn't mean it exists.
1.3.2.2.3.3. Con: Given any particular religion in 2017, there are at least twice as many non-followers as followers in the world. Would that mean that God mostly does not exist?
1.3.2.2.3.4. Con: Many people also believe in faeries,  which is why we have to temper the opinion of the many with the wisdom of the few according to Aristotle.
1.3.2.2.4. Pro: Adopting a similar philosophy of people with whom you can benefit by association is a time-honored practice.

Although this doesn't necessarily contribute to any material evidence that such beliefs are true.
1.3.2.3. Pro: There are no empirical proofs or conclusive logical-philosophical demonstrations of the existence of God. God is only known in faith. You can never 'prove' the nature of that experience to those without faith, as by definition that experience is personal.
1.3.2.3.1. Con: The word translated as "faith" in English is the Greek word "pistis", a word used in the technical language of Ancient Greek rhetoric. Aristotle gives the definition in his book "Rhetoric" as "forensic proof" when used as a noun, and "trust based on evidence" when used as a verb. This changes the Biblical definition of faith from the more modern "belief in something you cannot prove". The NT provides historical claims to public acts that Jesus performed as evidence for "pistis" in Christ.
1.3.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.2.1.
1.3.2.3.3. Con: All experiences are personal.
1.3.2.3.4. Con: Any  argument without evidence to support it is not a good reason to believe.
1.3.2.3.4.1. Con: Mathematical proofs do not have evidence, yet we take them as good reason to believe their conclusion.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1. Con: A mathematical proof is, itself, the argument which proves a theorem with evidence.
[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof)
1.3.2.3.4.2. Con: An argument is evidence, in and of itself.
1.3.2.3.4.2.1. Con: An argument is not evidence in the exchange in which it is used, but may be evidence merely that an argument was stated.

For example, if I have a red pen and argue that "this pen is blue", my argument is not evidence that the pen is blue, but my statement could be used as evidence that I lie.
1.3.2.3.5. Con: This is not an argument for the existence of God as much as it is an argument against reason and rational inquiry. If this argument is accepted, the entire concept of rational debate on which this thesis is founded is internally inconsistent and the discussion cannot continue. This would not prove the existence of God, it would only prove that a rational debate cannot be had as to whether God exists.
1.3.2.3.6. Con: Faith \(or the experience of God\) is a form of empirical knowledge, but it cannot be used in a proof, because it is personal in nature.
1.3.2.3.6.1. Pro: Incorrect things can be believed by faith. As such, it is not a form of [empirical proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence).
1.3.2.3.6.1.1. Con: Incorrect things can be believed by empirical proof. This is the basis for almost all illusions, such as optical illusions.
1.3.2.3.7. Pro: Faith and belief are cognitive functions the holder possess because of the inability to explain super complex ideas and sensations beyond the mental maturity of the holder.
1.3.2.3.8. Con: Arguments for theism are not designed to show "proof" \(100% certainty\), but rather are designed to show that the existence of God is more compatible with the evidence we have than the non-existence of God.
1.3.2.4. Pro: The Catechism of the Catholic Church [\(#47\)](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c1.htm) declares that "the one true God, our Creator and Lord, can be known with certainty from his works, by the natural light of human reason \(cf. Vatican Council I, can. 2 § 1: DS 3026\)."
1.3.2.4.1. Con: This is circular reasoning.  An institution that depends upon the existence of god produces literature that self-verifies its own claims.
1.3.2.5. Con: Faith \(in the sense of non-empirical knowledge\) is indistinguishable from a claim of faith. In other words, true faith and false faith both manifest as claims of faith. Therefore, faith claims cannot be used to justify belief over disbelief.
1.3.2.6. Con: It is possible to know that God exists without faith.
1.3.2.6.1. Pro: There is a difference between personal knowledge, and abstract understanding. Aristotle reasoned his way into abstract understanding of the existence of God, but \(as far as we know\) did not have the gift of the Holy Spirit, or any other personal experience of God.Thus it is possible to know that God exists without faith.
1.3.2.7. Con: Faith as an epistemology can and is used to come to mutually exclusive conclusions and as such can be discarded as a reliable means for deriving truth. It's subject is often asserted without reason and defended against all reason. Any rational process working toward understanding of reality will therefore not be based on faith.
1.3.2.8. Con: There is a cart before the horse problem here. "One must believe that God exists," is being used to support the above claim that "supports the existence of God."
1.3.3. Pro: Many people have religious experiences involving God. Not just beliefs, but actual experiences.
1.3.3.1. Con: People have had similar experiences regarding e.g. pagan gods and nature spirits, so unless we accept that all of these exist we cannot use this as proof of God's existence.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.
1.3.3.2. Con: An experience of god doesn't suggest the existence of god. The term religious experience is defined by a religious person, not by an atheist. If religion provides self certification of a religious experience, then that claim can't be tested. That means that experience may or may not be true.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: An atheist who has a compelling religious experience would no longer be an atheist, so by this standard no account of personal revelation would be valid no matter how trustworthy or reliable. It's like a flat-earther denying all orbital photographs of the Earth's curve that weren't taken by a fellow flat-earther.
1.3.3.3. Con: Lighter and more complete theories than "God" can explain extraordinary phenomenons.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: For example, Lourdes is regarded as a sanctified site for many Catholics where miraculous healing would appear, but in fact, there are no more cancer healings in this site than there are spontaneous unexplained cancer healing in any other place.
See [Les miracles, Lourdes et les probabilités \(French\)](http://www.charlatans.info/lourdes-miracles.php), quote: "We can say that with 67 healings in slightly more than 150 years, results are not more impressive in Lourdes that in hospitals."
1.3.3.4. Pro: God the Father and Jesus Christ visited Joseph Smith. [First Vision](https://www.lds.org/topics/first-vision?lang=eng)
1.3.3.4.1. Con: Joseph Smith was a well known charlatan for his time, and ended up being murdered by his own followers after it was revealed he was deceiving them.  There's no evidence that the Book of Mormon is anything other than fiction.[Joseph Smith](http://freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/Joseph_Smith)
1.3.3.5. Pro: God spoke to Moses "as a man speaketh to another." [Exodus 33:11.](https://www.biblestudytools.com/kjv/exodus/33-11.html)
1.3.3.5.1. Con: You cannot use the book stating that God exist as a proof that God exist.
1.3.3.5.2. Con: There is no archaeological or paeleological [evidence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/12/10/was-moses-real/?utm_term=.e6ec959d58f2) to suggest Moses existed. In fact, most biblical historians do not believe he existed.
1.3.3.5.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.6.4.
1.3.3.6. Pro: The Apostles were eye witnesses to miracles, which are evidence that God exists.
1.3.3.6.1. Con: We cannot asses how reliable the Apostles themselves are. People tell lies, or just are wrong sometimes, and that might be the case for them too.
1.3.3.6.2. Con: There is no contemporary or direct testimony on Jesus.  While there are records from Rome during the time he lived, there are zero contemporary references.  The gospels appear to have been written at least 70-300 years after the fact.[Who would have noticed in Jesus' time?](http://freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/A_Silence_That_Screams)
1.3.3.6.3. Con: Attempting to prove existence by means of “evidence” found within the pages of questionable texts is a circular argument that requires a leap of faith.
1.3.3.7. Pro: Altered states of consciousness including dreams, hallucinations, astral projections and other out-of-body experiences, often are of a spiritual nature or are instructive, hinting at a greater intelligence or at least the existence of something beyond the physical.
1.3.3.7.1. Con: Dreams, hallucinations, astral projections and OBEs find physical expressions and can be interpreted as body phenomenons. Psychological experiences can explain and reproduce such phenomenons without involving "God".
1.3.3.7.2. Con: Dreams and hallucinations can be interpreted in any way to confirm your beliefs. If you believe in 'anything', you can then twist dreams to fit within the narrative of your beliefs. Who's to say dreams don't 'actually' show that we are living in a virtual universe created by omnipotent chickens?
1.3.3.7.3. Con: All mental states can be proven to be a function of the material operation of the brain.  There is no science suggesting there is anything supernatural going on. When a brain dies, it ceases any mental activity.
1.3.3.8. Pro: The fact others have personal experiences of God should be accepted as a good reason to believe God exists.
1.3.3.8.1. Pro: Rejecting this would be like assuming a missing soldier is dead, while ignoring individual reports that he is alive.
1.3.3.8.1.1. Con: Rejecting this would be like accepting you don't know whether or not a missing soldier is dead, regardless of reports he is alive, because he has not yet been found in either state.
1.3.3.8.2. Con: Consistent application of this standard would require one to accept any and all such claims.  But we know contradictory experiences are commonly reported by adherents of different religions.
1.3.3.8.3. Con: Accepting this would be like assuming fairies exist because people claim they've had a lost tooth replaced with money by the tooth fairy at night.
1.3.3.9. Pro: There are experiential arguments for the existence of God as a universal power. Those reports come from some practitioners of Yoga, Meditation, and other spiritual practices. Even though these reports are not yet scientifically verified, the accounts are nearly identical.
1.3.3.9.1. Con: The account of a report that is not scientifically verified cannot afford a scientific impact.
1.3.3.9.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.2.2.
1.3.3.9.2. Con: The practices of yoga and meditation do not require a belief in a god to be effective. Since a god is not common in all of these practices, it is not required to get the effects.
1.3.3.10. Con: Where truth is defined as empirical knowledge of reality, personal revelation cannot provide truth.  Any two people can individually boil water under the same conditions and it will boil in the same way regardless of what either of them may believe.  But experiences with gods can yield widely varying ideas about what god is for any two individuals-- hence all the various religions.  There is no truth \(as defined above\) related to gods because gods are not empirically observable.
1.3.3.11. Con: Individual experiences are not sufficient evidence as people are able to experience things that do not match reality.
1.3.3.12. Con: Anecdotal evidence is the least reliable kind of evidence. This means experiences \(in this context with god\) have little to no value when it comes to proving whether a proposition \(the existance of god\) is true or false.
1.3.3.13. Con: People of all religions claimed to have had religious experiences. Evangelical Christians claim to have experienced the presence of Jesus. Catholics have experienced the Virgin Mary or a saint. Muslims claim to have had a religious experience with Allah. Buddhists with Buddha and Hindus with Krishna or another deity and so on and so on. This is not evidence for the existence of God but evidence that religious experiences are psychological in nature.
1.3.3.14. Con: Such experiences do not necessarily validate God specifically. They could validate any of numerous other things. The individual might only interpret the experience as religious as a result of confirmation bias.
1.3.3.14.1. Con: Lack of validation is no indication of the opposite. Even the scientific method is not interested in validation, only falsification and partial support, which is offered by personal religious experiences.
1.3.3.14.1.1. Con: The scientific method definitely cares about validation precisely because so many scientific observations are of effects with only statistical results.   The more independent trials validating the result the more unlikely the negative is. What you are observing is a publication bias caused by journals so aren't interested in publishing results like "Yes, relativistic effects have been demonstrated yet again", etc.
1.3.4. Con: There's no evidence to show that divine experiences are anything other than wishful-thinking, fallacious reasoning, or fraudulent reporting.
1.3.4.1. Con: 1. The view that the 5 senses are the only ways people can perceive evidence is unnecessarily limited. 
2. Well over half of all people in the world believe in God, many of whom claim that they can perceive God in a way that they don't trace to the 5 senses. 
3. Therefore, it is not irrational to consider the possibility of God's existence and that people may be perceiving God in a way other than through the 5 senses.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: There are more then 5 senses, but there is no reason to believe any of them can sense something divine. The "divine sense" just moves the problem of not having a reason to believe in God to one of not having a reason to believe in the sense of God.
1.3.4.2. Con: The currently accepted standards for science and epistemology may not be adequate to account for true religious experience, even if it were assumed there was such a thing.
1.3.5. Pro: Thousands of Christian martyrs have been giving their lives annually, adding up to millions over the centuries. They all were killed for asserting the truth of Jesus's deity, authority, death, and resurrection \(i.e. in support of the Christian God\). These sacrifices have been going on since the Acts of the Apostles.
1.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2.2.
1.3.5.2. Con: New Testament scholar Candida Moss argues that ["Christians were never the victims of sustained, targeted persecution."](https://www.salon.com/2013/02/24/the_myth_of_persecution_early_christians_werent_persecuted/)
1.3.5.2.1. Con: Moss claims that Christians weren't persecuted for their beliefs, but does state that they were executed for "publicly denying the divine status of the emperor" - which is a fundamental part of Christian belief \(that there is only one God\).
1.3.5.2.2. Pro: In the Annals 15.44, written by Roman historian Tacitus, Jesus and the Christians are mentioned. It [recounts](http://law2.umkc.edu) how Emperor Nero went after Christians in order to draw attention away from himself after Rome's fire of 64 AD.
1.3.5.2.3. Pro: According to [Harari](http://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/), the Roman persecutions of Christians over five centuries amounted to the deaths of no more than a few thousand people. This a fraction of what Christians did to each other within a  [24 hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre) period in 1572.
1.3.5.3. Con: Martyrs may be wrong in their belief.
1.3.5.3.1. Pro: Throughout history, people have chosen to die for causes, some of which have proven to be [unworthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown).
1.3.5.3.1.1. Pro: Many people have died and continue to die on both sides of religious wars and for religious causes. They cannot all be right. So people dying for a cause simply can't be taken as it being righteous.
1.3.5.3.2. Pro: A thing is not necessarily true because a man [dies](https://books.google.com/books?id=F6skDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT310&dq=%22A+thing+is+not+necessarily+true+because+a+man+dies+for+it%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwidoYW8uLDZAhWIvVMKHUCnCbYQ6AEIQjAF#v=onepage&q=%22A%20thing%20is%20not%20necessarily%20true%20because%20a%20man%20dies%20for%20it%22&f=false) for it.
1.3.5.3.3. Con: Just because someone believes in something that is *possibly* wrong does not make the belief completely unsubstantiated. They could be wrong, yes, but they could also be right. Stating that something could be wrong is not an argument against it.
1.3.5.3.4. Pro: The Aztecs used human sacrifices to keep the sun aloft.
1.3.5.4. Con: Most religions with different concepts of God have "Martys", in thousands. There is no yardstick to measure whose Martyrdom was for the truth.
1.3.5.5. Con: The action here, becoming a martyr, doesn't support the existence of a god; it only demonstrates the degree to which an individual believes in the existence of a god. The fact that these individuals number in the millions doesn't add credibility anymore than the existence of Santa Clause is made credible by the millions of children who believe in him.
1.3.6. Con: The same experiences involving God happen with other deities, such as Shiva, Ogum, and any other kind of god or spiritual entity. If we agree that all one of these experiences are real, then the God of classical theism cannot exist.
1.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.
1.3.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.1.4.
1.3.6.3. Con: The fact that the belief in God is prevalent, even among groups who refuse to believe or accept any of the other claims from competing groups, tends to add further weight to the belief in God.
1.3.6.3.1. Con: Many of the religions referred to are polytheistic rather than monotheistic, and therefore a belief in gods, rather than a belief in God.
1.3.6.3.2. Con: The "further weight to believe" is not evidence of existence.  All religions cannot be right at the same time, because their gods and beliefs contradict each other.
1.3.6.4. Pro: Classical theism is monotheistic.
1.3.6.5. Pro: What you see in a near-death experience, is influenced by your cultural background, including your [religion](http://www.horizonresearch.org/near-death/intro-to-the-nde-phenomena/religion-culture-and-near-death-experiences/). People that see an angel or a god, only see ones consistent with their own religious beliefs \(regardless of whether they're f.e. Christian or Hindu\).
1.3.6.5.1. Con: Cultural background definitely shapes up the way the experience is presented, however, universal elements such as seeing deceased relatives, a supreme being, a white light tunnel do exist.
1.3.6.6. Pro: The differences between deities experienced in revelations are surface-level differences. The same ultimate being is at the root of some, many, or all of them.
1.3.6.7. Con: Hindu scriptures solve the contradiction of multiple Gods in two ways. One is by explaining them as avatars - all Gods are manifestations of a [Supreme being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman). The other is to say that since the Ultimate, by description, is all-everything, it must therefore be beyond even intellectual form - so Shiva and Ogum and God cannot help but be human/ 4 dimensional/ geography specific approximations of the Supreme god \(or theistic deity\).
1.3.6.8. Con: Christianity, which endorses classical Theism, does not claim that God is the only spiritual entity in the universe. Encounters with a spiritual entity do not necessarily mean that such encounters are with God Himself. Therefore, a spiritual encounter with a being who is not God in no way implies that God does not exist.
1.3.7. Con: Anecdotal evidence doesn't provide a quantifiable amount of verifiable information to use as a determination for whether a given claim is true or not true.
1.3.7.1. Pro: If anecdotal evidence were legally enough evidence to convict a person of a crime then it would only take a small group of people making a claim that a crime took place to convict the accused, which would make it easy to unjustly convict people. Thus, anecdotal evidence in favor of the existence of God should be ignored.
1.3.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.3.7.3. Pro: Arguments from personal experience are highly subjective and not verifiable or observable.
1.3.7.4. Con: Alternately personal experience is fairly used to verify information for one's self.  

The possibility of revelation and direct experience gives reason to give some credence to claims, and while not being enough for an external determination is very compelling to the one who experienced it first hand.

Even if the only way for a hypothetical external observer to test this is to cease being an external observer this is a relevant point to the enquiry \(as none of us are truly external\).
1.3.7.4.1. Con: Since we want to know whether god exists in our shared world \(reality\), rather than in some person's halucinations and mistakes, personal experience is unfit and unreliable for a task that is a prori implausible \(unlike the more commonplace cases where due to similarities with prior confirmed cases we already have basis to affirm plausibility in addition to the personal experience\).
1.3.7.4.1.1. Con: Because Merriam-Webster includes a definition of "a priori" as "[presupposed by experience](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/a%20priori)", it seems that personal experience is precisely the tool required to evaluate a priori assumptions.
1.3.7.4.2. Pro: I myself can use my own experience as proof of God. All experience,even A priori experience is personal. Any specific experience of any certain individual is either proof of Creation or proof of Entropy. One may say he doesn't believe in God. This means that certain individual is an unbeliever in God therefore a believer in the absence of God which is death or entropy. The physical proof of this claim is the relationship between choice and consequence: Good choices lead to good consequences.
1.3.7.5. Con: Once you analyse all the known points of view of a certain Historical Data from all the dimensions you may now interpret that historical data\(i.e.cultural context of the time,human habits of that period, the roots and all known coincidences \(i.e. The existence of dinosaurs discovered through bones in different parts of the world\) one develops distinct capacities in relation to that certain data. This simply means:You become a master of it and your logic may filter the bias. You become a scholar.
1.3.8. Pro: God uses prophets to bear witness of his existence, his nature, his attributes, and how to live in mortality. Through prophets, God has said that if you strive to emulate his nature, attributes, and follow his directives, you will know the truth of his existence. God has stated that you can know whether a prophet is true or false by the results of their teachings.
1.3.8.1. Con: The claim that the aforementioned prophets are endorsed by God lacks confirmation.
1.3.8.2. Con: Prophets often endorse contradictory claims \(example: [Matthew 5:44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A44&version=NIV) and [Koran 2:191](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&verse=191)\).
1.3.8.2.1. Con: It is not surprising to find prophets from two different religions making contradictory claims.
1.3.8.2.1.1. Pro: Two prophets from two dissimilar religions worshiping different concepts of God \(one or both of which may be false Gods\) provide no basis for an expectation of consistency.
1.3.8.3. Con: This point is circular within the broader argument, because it essentially makes the claim: “We know how to know God, because God told the prophets and they told us.” If god doesn’t exist, he didn’t tell the prophets anything.
1.3.8.4. Con: No prophet has ever been shown to have specific, precise, and accurate knowledge of the future that cannot be explained by chance or their personal influence.
1.3.8.4.1. Pro: There have been many supposed prophets since the scientific revolution, and so have been many opportunities for these people to prove themselves to be genuine, if they wished.
1.3.9. Pro: A person can come to know God exists by learning about his will and then practicing it for a period of [time](http://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm). If what you have learned and implemented is true, God will [communicate](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%2016.13-17) it to you, and by this you will know that God exists.
1.3.9.1. Con: At it's core, this argument claims "God exists because the Bible says that God exists and the Bible is the word of God." This is a blatant fallacy, [begging the question](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/begging-the-question). Using statements from a Christian text that presupposes the existence of God as "proof" of God's existence is circular logic.
1.3.9.1.1. Con: "Using statements from a Christian text that presupposes the existence of God as 'proof' of God's existence is circular logic" is only true if the trust in the Christian text is warranted exclusively by its claims to be God's word. Most Christian scholars evaluate the trustworthiness of the Bible as they do any other text, including the use of [textual criticism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/textual-criticism).
1.3.9.1.2. Con: Such circular logic is valid, but the "proof" from the parent claim would be considered independent in its source \(i.e from God\). This is because the teachings/words themselves are not evidence of God but rather the consequences of it.
1.3.9.2. Con: This relies on subjective experiences. When a person affirms that God is communicating with him/her we don't have any mean to verify if that is true.
1.3.10. Con: Hallucinations are regularly experienced.  However fascinating, these experiences provide no evidence supporting the existence of anything observed or experienced in the hallucination
1.3.10.1. Pro: There is no objective standard for whether a given religious experience is a hallucination, or a revelation. It is judged differently by observers, in accordance with their bias.
1.3.10.2. Con: Hallucinations are not shared. They take place in one mind independent and irrespective of another. Eye witness accounts by a large number of people cannot rationally be explained as a shared hallucination.
1.3.10.2.1. Con: There have been shared hallucinations recorded as well. The phenomenon is called ["Folie à deux"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_%C3%A0_deux).
1.3.10.2.1.1. Con: Folie a deux is shared delusion not hallucination.
1.3.10.3. Con: This claim equates, without defense of such equivocation, an individual's religious experiences and hallucination. Without evidence to show that these are the same, this claim becomes a straw man argument.
1.3.10.4. Con: Stating that "Hallucinations are regularly experienced" implies that ones experience with a higher power is always linked to hallucinating.
1.3.11. Con: God is perfectly capable of existing regardless of whether humans know of his existence or not. 

For many years, men believed that [coelacanths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coelacanth) were extinct, until one was caught. Our lack of knowledge did not prevent the fish from existing.
1.3.11.1. Con: There were fossils indicating the previous existence of the fish, which is evidence for their existence even though they were not yet observed.
1.3.11.1.1. Con: Fossils were strong evidence that the fish had existed... not that they still exist to this day. To use another analogy, atoms existed long before they were discovered.
1.3.11.1.2. Con: The claim makes a serious category error. Looking for fossils of a non-corporeal being is like searching for love in a fishbowl... it's logically incoherent.
1.3.11.1.3. Con: The claim commits the fallacy it attempts to refute. The claimants lack of knowledge of such fossils do not require that they do not exist.
1.3.11.2. Con: It was still known that the fish had at least existed once, unlike God, who we have no evidence for whatsoever.
1.3.12. Con: A claim that rests on something being divine assumes the existence of a divinity. If the existence of God is in question, the interlocutor cannot accept divinity as part of the argument \(as that would be circular\).
1.3.12.1. Con: Just as with the use of assumptions in logic, the existence of the divine can be assumed in order to build on the argument with additional evidence and reasoning.
1.3.13. Con: In most instances, followers are born into their religion. Their parents expose them to faithful practices and religious experiences early on. This is similar to indoctrination practices, which provide false sense of belonging and a distaste for divergent thought.
1.3.13.1. Con: This is a [genetic fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/genetic). The origins of one's belief in a proposition has no impact on whether the proposition is true.
1.3.13.1.1. Con: It's not a matter of where someone was brought up, but how.
1.3.13.1.1.1. Con: This is still a genetic fallacy. How someone was brought up has no bearing on the veracity of their beliefs. Each belief must be evaluated in terms of the evidence for it. Upbringing has no impact on this evidence.
1.3.13.1.1.1.1. Con: A genetic fallacy would describe an argument based on someone's nature, or the biological makeup of a person. The grandparent claim is one based on nurture, and this 100% has an influence on what people believe and how they practice their beliefs.
1.3.13.1.2. Con: With all of the religions in the world, either all of them are wrong, or all but one are wrong.
1.3.13.1.2.1. Pro: With all the variations of god, the main problem facing humanity, the means of overcoming the problem to attain salvation, and the concept of salvation, it is probable that one religion has a correct worldview. But, because of these variations, if one religion were correct, all the others would be wrong.
1.3.13.1.2.2. Con: By simply following the [common](http://www.religioustolerance.org/reciproc2.htm) moral code, or the [law of reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule), one can attain salvation \(or in religions that believe in reincarnation, be closer to attaining it.\)
1.3.13.1.2.3. Pro: Given N differing propositions, either N or N-1 must be fallacious.

One of them might be true, or they all could be false. But because they all differ, they can't all be true.
1.3.13.1.3. Con: This is a [fallacy fallacy.](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/the-fallacy-fallacy) The grandparent claim doesn't invalidate the great grandparent claim on the basis of genetics or nature of the followers, but the nurture or the means in which they were instructed to believe. The parent claim incorrectly asserts the opposite.
1.3.13.2. Pro: Either one religion is right, and the rest are wrong, OR all of them are wrong. This would suggest the number of people who are groomed to believe an incorrect religion is very high, if not the majority of believers.
1.3.13.3. Pro: Stating that the means of obtaining information is tainted, therefore the information gained from it is too, is nothing more that an example of [Fruit of the poisonous tree.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree) This is an argument that is good enough for the U.S. judicial system.
1.3.13.4. Con: This danger also possible in non-religious families. Darwin's grandfather Erasmus Darwin must have influenced him [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Darwin)
1.3.13.4.1. Con: The scientific method means the point is moot: any inherited knowledge would be verifiable, and one does not assume that a theory is correct without adequate proof.
1.3.14. Con: The belief in God can be explained and predicted using rational thought: sociology, psychology, history, etc.
1.3.14.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.1.
1.3.15. Con: Even if the revelation is truly from God and is properly interpreted by the one receiving revelation, such an experience is personal and only justifies belief for that individual. However, it cannot be used as part of an argument to persuade others who have not had that experience.
1.3.15.1. Con: Many revelations and experiences, especially miracles, can be shared. Modern experiences include claims of individuals being healed by prayer in which others can confirm that symptoms seem much better after the prayer. \(Not to mention religious texts like the Bible recording instances where groups experience miracles together, such as the parting of the Red Sea\).
1.3.16. Con: The symptoms of some mental conditions cause people to hear voices in their head. Without modern understanding of this condition, an Iron Age man could perceive it as divine revelation, or at the very least, supernatural.
1.3.16.1. Con: Ancients had some understanding of mental illness \(mentions of "madness" and "demon possession" are in ancient texts\), even if it wasn't as comprehensive as ours. Even so, groups often accepted an individual's claims of revelation, choosing not to believe that it was madness or possession.
1.3.17. Con: Humans report religious experiences and develop religious narratives, including the existence of God, as a result of their painful experiences and hardships. If you alleviate the hardships, there would be no need to attribute success to God.
1.3.17.1. Pro: It seems God is held responsible for both good & bad tidings when He may not even exist. E.g., a regular church-going friend lost his spouse to death & stopped attending church, blaming God for her death.
1.3.17.2. Con: Some have reported about God without \(or at least before\) having any major hardship. King Solomon is one example.
1.3.18. Con: The object of ones faith and the subsequent practices, as well as the context of ones experiences can all be based on provable falsities; hence any claim of revelation is only in support of the existence of revelation and not in support of the existence of God
1.4. Pro: Philosophical arguments support the existence of God.
1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.
1.4.2. Pro: [Axiological arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiology) support the existence of God.
1.4.2.1. Pro: [Moral arguments](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-arguments-god/) support the existence of God.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: If you listen to people, God has been for, or against whatever happens to be in their best interest at the time. If one is looking for humans determining for themselves what is moral without the application of reason, they thus need look no further then a theist.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: The selfish nature of humanity does not disprove the existence of God. It only proves that many theists are selfish or insincere. The flaws of mankind are distinct from the existence of God.
1.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Those that follow God-free, logic-based moralities are much better behaved, and consistent than theists do in no small part to fundamental foundational problems with theism.
1.4.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Since the ability to determine whether a person who claims to follow some moral code actually does is limited to him being honest, there is no reliable method to evaluate what every person does in relation to the moral code he claims to follow.
1.4.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The horrible practice of the [gospel of wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology) is an example of theistic indiscretion.
1.4.2.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Theistic sources are contradictory, allowing one to choose morals convent for them, rather then to be consistent, or good. For example, the bible argues both [for](http://www.evilbible.com/evil-bible-home-page/slavery/) and [against](https://www.openbible.info/topics/anti-slavery) slavery. It is impossible to be good when what is good isn't even consistently defined.
1.4.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.
1.4.2.1.3. Con: In Plato's Socratic Dialogue "Euthyphro," it is proved that morality cannot feasibly come from a god, and thus must either exist or not independently. Thus moral arguments for god are all based on a shaky standing.
1.4.2.1.3.1. Pro: If God commands actions because they are right, then morality isn't grounded in God but instead supersedes him. But if actions are right because God commands them, then morality is arbitrary, as it is subject to the whims of God.
1.4.2.1.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.
1.4.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Morality isn't subject to God's whims because God is necessary and unchanging.
1.4.2.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2.2.1.1.
1.4.2.1.3.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.5.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3. Con: Morality isn't arbitrary because God is defined as being perfect, or maximally great.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.2. Pro: Many ontological arguments use God's perfection/maximal greatness as a premise to prove His existence.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.13.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.4.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.5.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.12.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.3. Con: Without a measurement to use, there is no maximum, or minimum. If morality isn't arbitrary due to God's greatness, there must be an objective yardstick for God to be the top of. If there is such a yardstick, then God is not the measure of morality. If not, then, once again, morality would be arbitrary.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.3.1. Con: Measurements can be based on similarity to a given reference \(such as the nature of God's mind\), without a need for an "objective yardstick."
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.3.1.1. Con: The concept of a "reference" is functionally identical to the concept of an "objective yardstick."
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: One point of reference is insufficient to create a system of measurement, as what is being measured is unknowable. For example, if God is the only reference for morality, then if someone was stupider, or less wise then God, if they preferred cheese more, or ham less, they would be just as immoral as a murderer, or a rapist.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Morality is relative, not absolute. Not every difference from God would have to be equally immoral.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Without a measuring stick, it is impossible to tell which aspects of God matter for the measurement of morality, and which ones don't.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.3.1.1.1.2. Con: A second point of reference isn't necessary to determine what is being measured.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.3.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Scientists can compare the relative sizes of the Earth and the Sun without getting confused by the fact that the Sun is hotter than the Earth, or concluding that the size difference must therefore be greater than what is physically measured.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.3.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: This is because measurements of size already exist, as does it what size is that is being measured. One doesn't measure the size of the sun by merely asking how different is is from the earth.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.3.1.1.1.2.2. Con: The only comparison here given is one where an existing scale already exists.
1.4.2.1.3.1.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.3.1.3.3.1.1.
1.4.2.1.3.2. Con: Euthyphro's dilemma could be regarded as a false dilemma.
1.4.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: One could keep asking why is whatever moral standard considered such moral standard in an infinite regress.
1.4.2.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Things could be bad because if you don't do them, you will be punished.
1.4.2.1.3.2.1.2. Con: Things could be good because they bring about a desirable end for the individual.
1.4.2.1.3.2.1.3. Con: Things could be good because they bring about a positive end in the aggregate.
1.4.2.1.3.2.1.4. Con: Things could be bad because if other people did them, it would bring harm to one's self.
1.4.2.1.3.2.1.5. Con: Things could be good because people with certain traits do them, or bad because people with other traits do them.
1.4.2.1.3.2.1.6. Pro: Euthyphro's dilemma could be applied to any objective moral standard.
1.4.2.1.3.2.1.6.1. Con: "is what is morally good commanded by \[objective standard\] because it is morally good, or is it morally good because it is commanded by \[objective standard\]? "
Well since it is an objective standard, the answer is the latter. So no, Euthyphro's dilemma does not at all apply to objective moral standards, because it does not create a dilemma.
1.4.2.1.3.2.2. Con: It seems highly unlikely that neither Socrates, not Euthyphro, both great thinkers, one on either side of the debate, saw this supposed problem while they were discussing this dilemma.
1.4.2.1.3.2.3. Pro: It commits the [fallacy of false dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma), in which something is falsely claimed to be an "either/or" situation, when in fact there is at least one additional option.
1.4.2.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: If morality originates in God's nature rather than His command Euthyphro's dilemma is avoided.
1.4.2.1.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.
1.4.2.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.3.2.3.1.
1.4.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.
1.4.2.1.5. Con: The moral argument for God's existence is not sound as it presupposes that objective moral laws exist, which has not been demonstrated.
1.4.2.1.5.1. Con: In support of premise \(1\), [Lewis](http://www.paul-gould.com/2012/12/19/c-s-lewis-the-moral-argument-for-god-and-the-gospel/#_ftn2) argues that we all have within us the sense of right behavior and character. There is a sense of “oughtness” that presses upon us. He says, “human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it.” \[Mere Christianity p 8\]
1.4.2.1.5.1.1. Con: The moral laws that apply to human beings should not be confused with a "Universal" moral law, which applies to everything.
1.4.2.1.5.1.1.1. Con: Applicability to everything is not necessary for a law to be objective. The statement "water is a liquid at room temperature and sea level pressure" is objectively true, despite only applying to water. This type of objective truth is all that is necessary for the moral argument.
1.4.2.1.5.2. Con: The existence of objective moral laws has been persuasively defended by many philosophers, including many philosophers who are not theists, such as [Russ Shafer-Landau](https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Realism-Defence-Russ-Shafer-Landau/dp/0199280207/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1528209042&sr=8-1&keywords=moral+realism%3A+a+defence), [David Enoch](https://www.amazon.com/Taking-Morality-Seriously-Defense-Realism/dp/0199683174/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1528209100&sr=1-1&keywords=taking+morality+seriously), and [Michael Huemer.](https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Intuitionism-Michael-Huemer/dp/0230573746/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1528209133&sr=1-1&keywords=ethical+intuitionism)
1.4.2.1.6. Pro: Morality is a purpose given to us by a creator.
1.4.2.1.6.1. Con: Being created for a purpose is not warrant for the goodness of that purpose. Building a gun to kill does not make it a moral good for that gun to fire and kill even though it does what it was designed to do.
1.4.2.1.6.1.1. Con: A gun being built for murder and then being successfully used for murder does make it a correctly functioning, and therefore "good", gun, even if it doesn't justify the moral actions taken by the human using it.
1.4.2.1.6.1.2. Con: Under this theory, manmade purpose isn't identical to morality, only Godmade purpose is.
1.4.2.1.6.2. Con: This doesn't solve the [is/ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem) and therefore doesn't explain morality as understood by human nature. The fact that humans were given a purpose doesn't mean their purpose is "correct".
1.4.2.1.6.3. Pro: In the same way that a clock that doesn't tell the time is a bad clock, a human who doesn't live a life of love and compassion is a bad human.
1.4.2.1.6.3.1. Con: A clock that doesn't tell the time is only subjectively a bad clock according to \(a subset of\) humans. In the same way, even if God did exist, that would not make morality objective.
1.4.2.1.6.4. Con: This claim is completely unsubstantiated.
1.4.2.1.7. Pro: [C.S. Lewis](http://www.paul-gould.com/2012/12/19/c-s-lewis-the-moral-argument-for-god-and-the-gospel/) reasoned from universal experience that universal law exists and thus, a universal law-giver exists.
1.4.2.1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.
1.4.2.1.7.2. Con: There's a difference between prescriptive and descriptive laws. Those set by a law giver, like the ones passed by the legislative branch, are prescriptive, while the ones humans develop through observation and analysis are descriptive. As the laws of nature scientists have discovered are descriptive, it would be invalid to deduce that a law giver must exist.
1.4.2.1.7.2.1. Pro: Laws do not require lawgivers.
1.4.2.1.7.2.1.1. Con: The moral law is prescriptive, and we have no other example of a prescriptive law without a law-giver.
1.4.2.1.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: Morality certainly isn't descriptive, in that it doesn't describe human behavior. Almost every moral realist will agree that humans break the moral law more often than they follow it.
1.4.2.1.7.2.1.1.2. Con: "If you don't eat, you will die" is an example of a prescriptive natural law.
1.4.2.1.7.2.1.1.2.1. Con: This is only an example of a true if-then statement, not a law.
1.4.2.1.7.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: all laws are if-then statements, if it is not consequential it is a definition, not a law.
1.4.2.1.7.2.1.1.2.2. Con: If someone does not value their life, they won't have a reason to "follow" this. The statement itself doesn't force someone to put value on their own life.
1.4.2.1.7.2.1.1.2.2.1. Con: the law does not force someone to follow it, it merely enacts consequences.
1.4.2.1.7.2.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: This is equivocation. The moral law isn't \(necessary\) one which enacts consequences for actions, but only prescribes the right actions to do regardless of its results.
1.4.2.1.7.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: ignoring moral law has consequences, just as with physical laws, like guilt, lack of depth of experience, lack of social progress, and social estrangement.
1.4.2.1.7.2.1.2. Pro: Lewis doesn't explain why moral laws require a law-giver, even though there are other laws that are not dependent on minds. Laws of Physics, for example.
1.4.2.1.7.2.1.2.1. Con: This is an equivocation of the word "Laws". Natural laws are simply descriptions of what would happen in nature under the given circumstances. The moral law describes what should happen under the given circumstances. The two are not equivalent.
1.4.2.1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.5.
1.4.2.1.7.4. Pro: For a universal Moral Law to exist, there must be a sort of 'order' in the universe. This order in the universe is what dictates humans acting/reacting according to the universal Moral Law.
1.4.2.1.7.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.2.1.
1.4.2.1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.2.1.
1.4.2.1.7.6. Con: Lewis is pushing back against the supposed absence of objective moral law in an atheistic universe. However, he fails to provide objective morals in a theistic universe. In his view, God is creating the law. The laws are conceived of entirely in the mind of God, and hence subjective. The only difference between God's subjective morals and human's subjective morals is that God has enough power to enforce his morals \(might makes moral right\).
1.4.2.1.7.6.1. Con: The unchanging and universal moral law still suffices as an explanation for our experience, even if it is "subjective" from the perspective of God.
1.4.2.1.7.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.
1.4.2.1.7.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.7.1.1.1.
1.4.2.1.7.6.4. Con: Lewis does not argue that God creates the law by His divine subjectivity or His will to impose them. That view is associated with nominalism and theological voluntarism, which Lewis rejected in favor of something more like Christian Platonism.
1.4.2.1.7.6.5. Con: The argument that God's morals are subjective does not apply if God is of a different kind and mind than us. If we are created rather than begotten \(that is being of different, more limited kind merely resembling the creator\) then our perception of available morality is not going to be equal to that of God.
1.4.2.1.7.6.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.4.6.1.
1.4.2.1.7.7. Con: CS Lewis's second premise \("If there is a universal Moral Law, there is a Moral Law-giver"\) is unsubstantiated.
1.4.2.1.7.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.7.2.1.
1.4.2.1.7.7.2. Con: To be an inherent pull towards following any sort of universal Moral Law, there must be a sort of 'order' to the universe. This order implies a force or being with greater complexity to implement this order. As a starting point for understanding this force or being that implements order, God can be assumed.
1.4.2.1.7.8. Con: CS Lewis's third premise \("If there is a Moral Law-giver, it must be something beyond the universe."\) is unsubstantiated.
1.4.2.1.7.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.
1.4.2.1.7.8.2. Con: Morals cannot be dictated by matter, space or, time.
1.4.2.1.7.8.2.1. Pro: By definition, morals deal not with what is but what ought to be.
1.4.2.1.7.8.3. Pro: Laws can be from internal sources. Many laws that affect the United States were written after its foundation by its citizens.
1.4.2.1.8. Con: Humans would have morals regardless of God. Things like murder are wrong because it hurts the survival of our species.
1.4.2.1.8.1. Con: Without objective moral axia, there is no way to derive that we ought not hurt the survival of our species \(i.e. that hurting the survival of our species is wrong\).
1.4.2.1.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.
1.4.2.1.8.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.5.
1.4.2.1.8.2. Con: To say that humans need God in order to know/understand morality is mischaracterizing the moral argument - that is a statement about moral epistemology \(why we know about morality\), whereas the moral argument is about moral ontology \(why morality exists in the first place\).
1.4.2.1.8.2.1. Con: If a God is not necessary from the moral argument then the moral argument does not imply God's existence.
1.4.2.1.8.3. Con: The survival of our species is not a moral priority.
1.4.2.1.8.4. Con: Eugenics and social darwinism help the survival of humanity by removing unfit genes. Forced conversion of homosexuals also helps human survival by increasing reproduction rate. Yet most agree that these actions are still morally abhorrent. Therefore, the survival of humanity is not identical to morality.
1.4.2.1.8.4.1. Con: Social darwinism is not a moral framework that came out of evolution - rather it is a moral framework intentionally designed by people drawing on a parallelism with evolutionary principles.
Conversely the moral framework that came out of evolution does take into account the well being of individuals.
1.4.2.1.8.5. Con: It is not self evident why the survival of our species would be morally good without God.
1.4.2.1.8.5.1. Pro: The [is-ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is–ought_problem) in philosophy states that you cannot derive what ought to be true solely from what is true.
1.4.2.1.8.5.2. Con: Immoral behavior harms the ability of humanity to survive.
1.4.2.1.8.5.2.1. Pro: Murder decreases the population.
1.4.2.1.8.5.2.2. Pro: Theft removes resources from those who can put them to good use.
1.4.2.1.8.5.3. Con: Moral behavior increases survival odds.
1.4.2.1.8.5.3.1. Pro: Saving lives keeps the genetic pool diverse.
1.4.2.1.8.5.3.2. Pro: Moral behavior promotes group cohesion.
1.4.2.1.8.5.3.3. Pro: Taking care of the needy discourages unrest.
1.4.2.1.8.6. Con: As society becomes increasingly atheistic, it also tends to moral laxity, which implies that many \(if not all\) moral codes stem from God.
1.4.2.1.8.6.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.8.2.
1.4.2.1.8.6.2. Con: Most morals that have laxed in recent times, such as the lack of 'chastity', 'reproductive duty', and 'decency', are based on theism or natural law. This only shows that those particular morals are connected to God existence or lack thereof.
1.4.2.1.8.6.2.1. Pro: Morals justified by other moral systems, like the utilitarian view that giving to people with less than you is good, have remained steady.
1.4.2.1.8.6.3. Con: Secular nations/societies are typically healthy. They tend to have decreased instances of homicide, STDs, and abortion, as well as increased life expectancy. [moses.creighton.edu](http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2005/2005-11.pdf)
1.4.2.1.8.6.4. Con: Theocracies have higher instances of terrorism.
1.4.2.1.8.6.4.1. Pro: Afghanistan, Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Yemen are theocracies.
1.4.2.1.8.7. Pro: Morality is sufficiently explained by evolution and the relationships between individuals. These objective features do not require a God.
1.4.2.1.9. Con: One of the tenets of a moral argument for the existence of God is a knowable abstract moral absolute. If the AMA is any of those demonstrated by known gods, the values have shifted over time. All deities have shown fluctuations in morals.
1.4.2.1.9.1. Con: The AMA isn't necessarily represented by the god of any particular religion.
1.4.2.1.9.2. Con: Subscribing to a religion doesn't require that you believe everyone who claimed to speak about God's morals was telling the truth and unmotivated by personal goals. Thus, any perceived shifts in God's morals can be ascribed to shifts in people, rather than God.
1.4.2.1.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.1.1.
1.4.2.1.9.3. Pro: In the case of the Judaeo-Christian god, the old testament god who demands virgin sacrifice seems to modernize as humanity does. If there were an AMA by a perfect being it should stand out among the bronze age human-sacrifice rituals, not blend in with them.
1.4.2.1.9.3.1. Con: There is only one story in the [Old Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac) where God commands human sacrifice, and this was only a test which was revoked before the sacrifice actually happened.
1.4.2.1.9.3.2. Con: There is no evidence within the Bible that the Judeo-Christian notion of God evolved and modernized. The God portrayed in Revelation has all of the characteristics of the God portrayed in the early Old Testament.
1.4.2.1.10. Con: Morality does not factor into the existence, or non-existence of an entity.
1.4.2.1.10.1. Con: There would be no reason to be moral without the existence of a higher entity.
1.4.2.1.10.1.1. Pro: The word ‘reason’ is used intentionally here. Without a higher being, we can ‘explain’ moral behaviour through evolution or the social contract theory etc. But without a higher being keeping us accountable - providing we could get away with something and avoid punishment - there is no ‘reason’ to be moral.
1.4.2.1.10.1.2. Con: Rational actors behaving 'morally' often achieve maximal combined utility outcomes.
1.4.2.1.10.1.3. Con: There are psychological reactive mechanisms in healthy people with trigger negative emotions in reaction to negative actions as well as positive actions. Humans have what is called empathy-based guilt reactions when they do something that harm others. \([researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268206560_Empathy-Based_Pathogenic_Guilt_Pathological_Altruism_and_Psychopathology)\) Likewise, empathy also rewards us positively when we do something good for others. Humans are already born with an instinctual barometric reaction mechanism for behavioral regulation with regards to how our actions affect others.
1.4.2.1.10.2. Pro: Morality itself doesn't support or refute anything as a fact but rather provides an argument why one action should be taken above another. Take the trolley dilemma as an example. Should the lever be pulled to save more lives or should no action be taken?
1.4.2.1.10.2.1. Con: This is an example of normative ethics, the discussion of what is right and what is wrong. The moral argument is an exercise in metaethics, the question of what moral statements mean and how they come to exist, which is very different.
1.4.2.1.11. Con: All morality is necessarily situational. Take a moral pronouncement and you can derive both a situation where it's justified and an alternate situation where it is not.
1.4.2.1.11.1. Con: If there isn't a standard morality, then there is no need to qualify any action by its context, because all things would be acceptable across all situations.
1.4.2.1.11.1.1. Con: [Moral relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism) holds that actions can be considered right or wrong, but that such a judgment depends on the context.
1.4.2.1.11.1.1.1. Pro: Agent relativism states that the morality of an action can only be determined by the person taking the action.
1.4.2.1.11.1.1.1.1. Con: Agent relativism isn't intuitive or held by many people - for instance, we still consider a murderer to be wrong, even if the murderer thinks that murder is morally permissible or even obligatory.
1.4.2.1.11.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Under agent relativism, since moral framework is decided entirely by the individual, individuals should be able to change their moral framework whenever it's convenient to them or they have a whim to. In reality, people don't treat morality as if it's subject to their own whims in such a way, and will deem it right to adhere to it even when it's inconvenient.
1.4.2.1.11.1.1.1.2. Con: Agent relativism isn't supported by the human instinct to justify one's own actions based on moral standards. For instance, if someone steals, they will attempt to justify the theft by saying that they need the stolen thing more than the original owner does, rather than simply saying that stealing is morally right to them. This implies that morality is based on something outside of the agent.
1.4.2.1.11.1.1.1.3. Con: Under agent relativism, morality is only motivated by internal beliefs, not by any external motivators. However, there are many examples of people's views of morality being changed by external motivators. For instance, imagine a man who believes that poor people deserve to suffer for the choices they make, but changes his mind after spending time with a poor family and coming to care about them. This scenario would not be possible under agent relativism.
1.4.2.1.11.1.1.2. Pro: Speaker relativism states that moral statements are true or false only according to the one who makes the statement.
1.4.2.1.11.1.1.2.1. Con: According to speaker relativism, when a claim is made, that claim is referring to the moral framework of the speaker. As such, when two people disagree about morality, they are speaking about two separate frameworks - and, as such, do not have shared meaning. Without shared meaning, real disagreement is impossible. Intuitively, this is not what moral disagreement is.
1.4.2.1.11.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: If one person says that planes fly through the air, and another person states that they don't, believing the word "plane" to refer to a [woodworking tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_\(tool\)), then the two people don't truly disagree because they aren't referring to the same thing.
1.4.2.1.11.1.1.2.2. Con: Speaker relativism isn't intuitive or held by many people. For instance, if someone says that murder is permissible, we intuitively believe that they are wrong, rather than just stating a truth about their own moral framework.
1.4.2.1.11.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.
1.4.2.1.11.1.1.4. Con: All forms of moral relativism fail to account for the general agreement amongst all of humanity of basic moral principles.
1.4.2.1.11.1.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.2.
1.4.2.1.11.1.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.2.1.
1.4.2.1.11.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.2.1.
1.4.2.1.11.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.2.1.
1.4.2.1.11.2. Con: Morality can be both situational and objective. Water is a liquid at certain temperatures/pressures and a solid at others, but the definition of water is still objective. In the same way, "it is wrong to do x in this situation" can still be a statement with an objective truth value.
1.4.2.1.11.3. Con: Most theists reject moral absolutism \(that certain actions are always either right or wrong, regardless of situation\). Moral realism \(that the rightness or wrongness of any given, situational action is objective\) still holds, and is all that is needed for the moral argument to work.
1.4.2.1.11.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.8.7.
1.4.2.1.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.2.1.
1.4.2.1.12. Con: There are as many moral arguments against the existence of God.
1.4.2.1.12.1. Con: There are no arguments against God from the existence of morality.
1.4.2.1.12.2. Pro: The god of Abraham is described as genocidal. Genocide is immoral. Therefore, moral arguments for the god of Abraham are invalid if they are based on omnibenevolence.
1.4.2.1.12.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.5.1.1.
1.4.2.1.12.2.2. Con: The "genocides" depicted in the Old Testament were God's punishment against evil people for their immorality. As such Genocide is not intrinsically immoral.
1.4.2.1.12.2.2.1. Con: Hitler's attempted genocide was punishment for his perceived evil nature of Jewish people, yet it was still immoral.
1.4.2.1.12.2.3. Pro: According to [Genesis 6-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6-9&version=NIV), God was the first entity to commit genocide, thereby inventing the practice.
1.4.2.1.12.2.4. Pro: According to [Exodus 11-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus+11-12&version=NIV), God committed genocide against the first born of Egyptian households.
1.4.2.1.12.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.3.1.
1.4.2.1.12.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.
1.4.2.1.12.4. Pro: Many theists base their belief in God on good in the world, while the stories in their religious texts tend to depict the Gods of classical theism as selfish evil tyrants with bad attitudes, short tempers, lust for death and destruction, and a general disregard for the value of anything other then themselves, even when those same texts defined such Gods as being good no matter what they do.
1.4.2.1.12.4.1. Con: The Christian God is depicted as slow to anger and rich in mercy.  Jonah actually complains to God that he is not nearly vengeful enough. \(Jonah 4\)
1.4.2.1.12.4.2. Con: God's justice and wrath against immorality is not evidence that God is an evil, selfish, tyrant.
1.4.2.1.12.5. Con: If God does not exist, there is no basis upon which to affirm objective moral values and duties. Therefore, talking about the morality of God is meaningless.
1.4.2.1.12.6. Con: If God exists, you can disagree with Him or reject Him as a moral monster. However, it makes no sense to disagree with or reject a God that doesn't exist. Therefore, moral objections to God’s existence are pointless.
1.4.2.1.13. Pro: Various basic human instincts such as responsibility \(and other similar instincts such as gratitude and awe\) are implicitly theistic. Being responsible is universally considered a virtue. This raises the question, to whom are we responsible? Is to ourselves \(like appointing your chief accountant to audit your company\)? To one another? By analogy with Aquinas' 5 Ways we can trace back the chain of responsibility to God the Judge before whom we are ultimately responsible.
1.4.2.1.14. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.
1.4.2.2. Pro: There are [aesthetic arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_beauty) for the existence of God.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: There isn't any reason a priori to expect the world to be fundamentally beautiful - however, if it was created by a perfect God, it would almost certainly be. As such, the fact that we exist in a fundamentally beautiful universe counts as evidence for a perfect Creator.
1.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: The Likelihood Principle states that if some observation O is likely under hypothesis A and less likely under hypothesis B, then O counts as evidence for A over B.

The existence of a fundamentally beautiful universe \(O\) is likely assuming a perfect creator \(A\), and less likely assuming the absence of such a creator \(B\).
1.4.2.2.1.2. Con: Much of the world isn't beautiful - for example, the atrocities committed by man and animals.
1.4.2.2.1.2.1. Con: God gave men and animals free will, including the freedom to defile natural beauty. The works that God is solely responsible for, excluding those sullied by free creatures, are fundamentally beautiful.
1.4.2.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Natural disasters or infections are not works of free creatures, but they are not beautiful. Which means God, if he exists, did not create a fundamentally beautiful universe.
1.4.2.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Even the case of the vast majority, but not all, of the universe being fundamentally beautiful is very unlikely without assuming intentional design.
1.4.2.2.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Natural disasters may wipe out much moral evil, and so may have the beauty and awe of divine justice.
1.4.2.2.1.2.1.1.3. Con: During natural disasters, many heroic acts are done, which are beautiful in their own right, and only possible in such dire situations, thus natural disasters can be made beautiful by acts of heroism.
1.4.2.2.1.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.1.4.
1.4.2.2.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.
1.4.2.2.1.3. Con: It's possible that the human conception of "beauty" adapted from experience of the outside world, and so it would be natural for humans to consider nature "beautiful."
1.4.2.2.1.3.1. Con: Many things not visible to early humans - such as planets, nebulae, and galaxies, or the microscopic structures of many materials - are still considered beautiful, despite humans having no time to adapt to them and come to see them that way.
1.4.2.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Our value of these other structures may be evolutionary [spandrels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel_\(biology\)).
1.4.2.2.1.3.2. Con: God may have [guided evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theistic_evolution).
1.4.2.2.1.4. Con: The universe is not fundamentally beautiful - for example, life is impossible in 99.99% of the universe, and millions of people die every year because of natural disasters.
1.4.2.2.1.4.1. Con: From a distance, the violent scenes of the cosmos are extremely beautiful, and since no life is at stake, they are not horrifying, yet remain awe inspiring.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: There is no particular reason a priori to expect natural laws to be elegant or beautiful, or even [so accurately described by mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences). However, intentional design by a perfect God could easily account for such elegance. As such, the fact that physical laws are mathematically elegant counts as evidence for a perfect Creator.
1.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: The fundamental laws of our universe are extremely elegant, whereas the vast majority of possible sets of natural laws are incredibly arbitrary and complex. This suggests maximization by some agent.
1.4.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Elegance in scientific theories is an illusion.
We, as pattern finding masters, project the elegance into these equations and modify them to fit our aesthetic values.
1.4.2.2.2.1.2. Con: Proving the universe has a purpose or was "maximized by some agent" does not prove the existence of a classical theistic God. It merely proves the existence of "some agent", which does not need to be God, or that the universe has a purpose.
1.4.2.2.2.1.2.1. Con: An agent that can maximize some quality about the universe would have to be transcendent and enormously powerful, if not omnipotent.
1.4.2.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.4.2.2.2.2. Con: While this could be considered evidence, this evidence is not sufficient or compelling. Aesthetics are subjectively pleasing, and something being found aesthetically pleasing doesn't necessitate it being made for personal appreciation. "Someone made this for me to enjoy," does not logically follow from "this is elegant and beautiful, in my opinion."
1.4.2.2.3. Pro: If aesthetic judgments have objective truth, [there must exist](https://philosophicalnarratives.wordpress.com/2017/11/16/why-beauty-points-us-towards-the-existence-of-god/) an objective standard or anchor point to justify them. Such an aesthetically perfect, objective, and transcendent anchor would be considered God.
1.4.2.2.4. Con: There is no thing necessitating objectivity in aesthetics. Indeed art, literature or any other thing that exhibits or conjures beauty is subjective in appreciation. One may fail to find beauty even where a billion others succeed, no known physical laws deny the possibility.
1.4.2.2.4.1. Con: A difference in appreciation of art need not be grounded in mere difference of opinion. It may just as well be a consequence of some sort of defect in the one person over the other.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Without a transcendent creator and arbiter which gives objective value to truth, there is no objective value to the pursuit of truth. The purpose of debates, such as the existence of God, are to pursue truth. Therefore, if none exists, the discussion is moot.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Truth has no inherent value. Truth has value if and only if there is an arbiter of mankind which can give value to truth.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Truth has objective value due to it's nature of being able to predict future events.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: The discussion of whether God exists is not a question of the effectiveness practicality of the belief, but of the truth of the belief. Therefore, the discussion itself only has value if truth has value.
1.4.2.3.3. Con: Objective value of truth can come from utilitarian point of view \(truth is valuable because it helps us in achieving our everyday goals\). Science is inherently valuable because it works \(produces useful technologies\), and science needs to stick to truth in order to work.
1.4.2.3.4. Con: If the value attributed to something were only subjective rather than objective, that's not an argument that the value is zero value.
1.4.2.3.5. Con: An alternative to divine truth might be considered to be consensus truth which would prevent this discussion from being rendered moot.
1.4.2.4. Con: Even if we accept the dubious premise that objective values exist, and even if we further argue that such values can only be given by a creator, it is a much simpler claim to argue that human beings \(beings for which we have empirical evidence\) are the creators of such objective values.
1.4.2.4.1. Con: Since humans don't have necessary existence, anything created or sustained by humans cannot itself have necessary existence. As such, any values caused solely by humans could not be objective.
1.4.2.4.1.1. Con: Necessity is not a precondition of objectivity.
1.4.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: We say the discoveries of the natural sciences are objective, yet they are all contingent.
1.4.2.4.1.2. Con: Objectivity is an ambiguous notion.
1.4.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: 'Objective' may be interpreted to mean either 'mind independent' or 'factual', while 'subjective' may mean 'mind dependent' or 'mere opinion'. 

Now it is a fact that I have a mind, but that fact is dependent upon my mind, so it is objective in that it's factual, but subjective in that it's mind dependent. Hence, there is ambiguity.
1.4.2.4.1.2.1.1. Con: This is a quite clever, but fallacious, equivocation.

Mind-independence in this context does not entail just one specific mind, but ALL minds. While the existence of the claimant's mind is, of course, dependent on the claimant's mind, the objective existence or non-existence of said mind is mind-independent of every other mind in existence.

There is no ambiguity in stating that the existence of one's mind is dependent on the existence of that mind--It's tautological.
1.4.2.4.2. Con: This would require a demonstration of humans being able to create objective values.
1.4.2.4.3. Con: Human beings have perception. This perception is subjective. For all have a different perception of things. Therefore it is very difficult for a person to be objective. If there is an allknowing god, who oversees all things, than He can be objective.
1.4.2.4.3.1. Con: An all-knowing God who oversees all things has the subjective perception of a being who sees all things. This is just another different perception of things, quantitatively more in what is seen but not any more objective in quality.
1.4.2.5. Con: Value is subjective.
1.4.2.6. Pro: The ontology and existence of logic cannot be justified in a naturalistic universe.
1.4.2.6.1. Pro: The laws of logic are immaterial.
1.4.2.6.1.1. Pro: The laws of logic cannot be changed by altering any physical substance.
1.4.2.6.1.2. Pro: The statement "No matter exists" would be true and logical if matter did not exist; therefore logic cannot depend on matter.
1.4.2.6.2. Pro: The laws of logic require a mind to exist; they have no reason to exist in a universe with no minds.
1.4.2.6.2.1. Pro: The laws of logic are rules for correct thinking. Thinking requires a mind. It is unlikely in a naturalistic universe that laws for correct thinking would exist platonically, waiting for minds that might or might not appear.
1.4.2.6.2.1.1. Con: The minds that conceived of logic are the minds of humans \(or, in a more basic sense, animals\). Patterns however don't require a mind to exist.
1.4.2.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Logic was not invented by humans; it was discovered and used by humans.
1.4.2.6.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Humans could not have made the [law of non-contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction) irrelevant to our universe. They discovered the law, they did not create it.
1.4.2.6.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: That law is not a feature of the universe, it only codifies a pattern observed in various instances in the universe. The existence of such instances does not require a mind.
1.4.2.6.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Humans could not have made the [law of the excluded middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle) irrelevant to our universe. They discovered the law, they did not create it.
1.4.2.6.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.6.2.1.1.1.1.1.
1.4.2.6.2.1.1.1.3. Con: Logic codifies patterns. Logic itself is a system made by humans.
1.4.2.6.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.2.6.2.1.1.
1.4.2.6.2.3. Con: The statement "there are no minds" would be true and logical in a universe where no minds exist.
1.4.2.6.3. Pro: The laws of logic would exist even if human or animal minds did not exist.
1.4.2.6.3.1. Pro: In the early seconds after the big bang, the statement "No human minds exist" was true and rational. However, no human existed to have a mind capable of processing that statement.
1.4.2.6.3.1.1. Con: Without minds to contain the sentence "no human minds exist" the claim was meaningless, rather than logical, true or rational.
1.4.2.6.3.1.1.1. Con: If it is rational to believe that a mind-dependent entity must exist even if human or animal minds do not, then it is logical to assume that some other mind exists.

The objection assumes that no other types of minds exist, which begs the question of the discussion. God is not human; it is plausible that a concept can exist in the mind of God, even if humans do not exist.
1.4.2.6.3.2. Con: That is at the very least baseless and at most completely incorrect. What would be justified to say is that patterns existed, not logic. Logic was invented later by humans to codify predictions regarding patterns of nature.
1.4.2.6.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.6.2.1.1.1.
1.4.2.6.4. Con: Our explicit conceptions of the laws of logic may transcend a naturalistic universe, however they have [derived](https://absoluteirony.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/laws-of-logic/), implicitly, from a naturalistic universe.
1.4.2.6.4.1. Pro: Our utterly unthinking ancient ancestors displayed behaviours consistent with logical thought. Human's "laws of logic" simply codified these responses into rules.
1.4.2.6.4.1.1. Con: This argument acknowledges that logic can exist, even if all human ancestors are "unthinking"--for otherwise, the claim that the unthinking ancestor's actions were logical would either be false, or meaningless.

Therefore this claim supports, rather than rebuts, the parent claim.
1.4.2.6.4.1.1.1. Con: The claim talks about the predictability of the naturalistic universe giving rise to the possibility of logical thought. It therefore rebuts the claim that logic is not possible in a naturalistic universe.
1.4.2.6.4.2. Pro: Logic can itself be conceptualised in differing ways. For example the "[law to exclude the middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle)" can be [written as](https://absoluteirony.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/laws-of-logic/): \(P∨∼P\) or \(P|P\)|\(\(P|P\)|\(P|P\)\). A different approach to the world would have led to a differing representation of a transcendent rule, derived from the same observations of nature.
1.4.2.6.4.2.1. Con: This addresses the conceptualization of logic, not the ontology of logic. The conceptualization of an entity does not explain why or how that entity exists.
1.4.2.6.4.2.1.1. Con: But that is what logic is: conceptualization. Patterns on the other hand don't really require an explanation, they can just be.
1.4.2.6.4.3. Pro: The predictability of the universe is sufficient for utility codifying a system of logic. As intelligent beings evolved the use of patterns was favored as it aided in survival, therefore giving rise to more and more complex logical systems.
1.4.2.6.4.3.1. Con: This system would necessarily prefer survival over truth. Natural selection of logic would allow an entity to believe a beneficial lie rather than a harmful truth. Such an entity would have no reason to believe that his thoughts \(including the claim above, or this claim\) were true.
1.4.2.6.4.3.1.1. Con: While people do believe in some beneficial lies over some harmful truths, the subset of beliefs that are part of the system we call logic do not share that trait \(in other words those are cherry picked ideas for the sole purpose of inducing truth\).
1.4.2.6.4.3.1.2. Con: The fact that these ideas are empirically verified to hold true is sufficient to establish that they hold true.
1.4.2.6.4.3.1.2.1. Con: If the parent claim is true, then we have no reason to trust our empirical verifications. These would be evolved beliefs and subject to the same filter of natural selection, which favors survival, not truth.
1.4.2.6.4.3.1.3. Con: Correct reasoning often does help in survival.
1.4.2.6.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: Correctly predicting the direction a predator is going improves the chances of escaping.
1.4.2.6.4.3.1.3.2. Pro: Understanding that if an individual predator is in a given place it is not in another place improves the chances of not being in the same area as a predator \(consequently being at a lower chance of getting preyed upon\).
1.4.2.6.4.3.1.3.3. Pro: Extrapolating that if a tree bears one fruit that isn't poisonous the other fruits are probably not poisonous either can aid in eating safer foods.
1.4.2.6.4.3.1.3.4. Con: While this is true in the examples given, it is irrelevant to the point. A false belief that was beneficial would be selected and reinforced in exactly the same way.
1.4.2.6.4.3.1.3.5. Con: An ability to properly interpret our environment does not necessarily imply an ability to determine truth about abstract and metaphysical claims.
1.4.2.6.4.3.1.3.6. Con: If the belief that "correct reasoning often does help in survival" is false, but beneficial to survival, then that belief would be selected and reinforced. On materialism, we have no way to rise above our programming to determine whether this is or is not true.
1.4.2.6.4.3.2. Con: If logic developed through evolution, then it is necessarily true that it could have developed differently than what it did. This would mean that the law of non-contradiction could have been false.
1.4.2.6.4.3.2.1. Con: It is not the usefulness of the law of non-contradiction that evolves, it is the ability to apply it, which not all things have.
1.4.2.6.4.3.3. Con: Evolution leads to diversity; yet we see one uniform law of logic across the universe. The law of non-contradiction is not true for one species but false for another.
1.4.2.6.4.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.6.4.3.2.1.
1.4.2.6.5. Con: The contradiction between a naturalistic world and the certainty that we experience through logic is a falacy, since logic itself is not certain, nor truly objective.
1.4.2.6.6. Con: The naturalistic view can contain a mind, and through self assuring entropic development, a consciousness. Consciousness itself is closely resembling an entropic process of self-modification like DNA evolution.
1.4.2.6.6.1. Pro: There's no need for any additional mystic or supernatural quality to explain the existence of consciousness.
1.4.2.6.6.1.1. Pro: In The Emperor's New Mind \<[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Mind)\>, Penrose proposes a very plausible explanation for the apearence of conscioussness.
1.4.2.6.6.1.1.1. Con: AI researchers, philosophers, computer scientists and other experts deny the plausibility of the thesis contained in [The Emperor's New Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Mind).
1.4.2.6.6.1.2. Con: Such a naturalistic consciousness would necessarily be deterministic, and any conclusions derived from that consciousness would be the product of naturalistic biochemical reactions and non-directed processes; more akin to a cosmic Plinko game than rational thought. 

If true, then the conclusion reached in the parent claim should not be assumed to be true, as the claimant could not have come to any other conclusion regardless of the evidence.
1.4.2.6.6.1.2.1. Con: Natural biochemical reactions are not deterministic, they derive from a great deal of chaos and randomness.
1.4.2.6.6.1.2.1.1. Con: "Chaos" and "randomness" in a naturalistic universe merely imply that too many variables exist to be tracked by humans or our tools. Neither chemistry nor physics are random; they behave according to well-established principles which permit us to understand our universe using the tools of science.
1.4.2.6.6.1.2.1.2. Con: If the parent claim is true, then consciousness is the product of chaos and randomness, and would produce random thoughts, not rationality. Therefore our reason could not be trusted.
1.4.2.6.6.1.2.2. Con: The fact that no supernatural explanation is required does not mean that such consciousness is deterministic. Quantum mechanics are not supernatural and are not deterministic
1.4.2.6.6.1.2.2.1. Con: It has not been shown that quantum events are non-deterministic. Some interpretations, such as the De Broglie–Bohm theory, have deterministic implications.
1.4.2.6.6.1.3. Pro: AI investigation will eventually be able to explain the rise of conscioussness.
1.4.2.6.6.1.3.1. Con: This is not only speculation, it is a "science of the gaps" argument. In other words, "we don't understand this, but someday, science will be able to fill in the gaps of our knowledge".
1.4.2.6.6.1.3.2. Con: In [The Emperor's New Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Mind), Penrose proposes that consciousness can never be modeled by a Turing machine. This includes modern AI systems.
1.4.3. Pro: [Teleological arguments](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleological-arguments/) support the existence of God.
1.4.3.1. Con: All forms of teleological arguments require "teloi" \("purposes"\). Until its existence is proven, we should assume that there is no such thing as purpose. Thus, teleological arguments all fail until purpose is shown to exist.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Artificial purposes exist, such as the purpose of an oven is to heat food.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: Artificial purposes do prove an agent with intent, but artificial purposes do not assist a teleological argument. Natural purposes are required for teleological arguments.
1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Teleological arguments infer the intent of a particular agent, the hypothetical creator of the universe. It's unclear how anything more is required for the argument to work.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Natural purposes do not exist. Assuming purpose to a natural thing, such as a rock, a tree, or a planet, assumes a creator to prove a creator.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: Natural purposes do exist. The heart's purpose is to pump blood throughout the organic system. The blood's purpose is to distribute nutrients \(and take waste\) to/from the organic system. Without these real purposes, the organic system would cease to function. Thus, teloi \(natural and unnatural\) exist.
1.4.3.1.2.2. Con: Assuming natural things do not have purpose assumes a lack of a creator to prove a lack of a creator.
1.4.3.1.2.3. Con: This only shows that the assertion of natural purposes is fallacious, but it doesn't follow from that that it is untrue.
1.4.3.1.3. Con: Not all teleological arguments assume intrinsic purpose, despite the etymology of the argument's name.
1.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: Life in our universe would be impossible if any of a number of [laws, constants, and initial conditions](https://calumsblog.com/2017/07/25/full-defence-of-the-fine-tuning-argument-part-4/) were changed even [unimaginably slightly](https://www.kialo.com/god-exists-3491/3491.0=3491.1+3491.641/+3491.641/comments). This implies the strong probability that the universe was created for the purpose of harboring life.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1. Con: Fine-tuning arguments can be explained via [multiverse theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse), without resorting to God as the source of order.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Multiverse theory and anthropic reasoning can successfully explain why the laws of nature permit living beings to exist, but cannot explain why the laws of nature are so simple and elegant, since the vast majority of possible worlds with intelligent beings have extremely convoluted and arbitrary natural laws.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: We only know about our own universe and therefore have no frame of reference for how simple and elegant our universe is.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Other sets of natural laws are conceivable, and those are often very complex. This is all that's required for them to be considered possible worlds under modal logic, which serves as our frame of reference to judge this universe.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: if they are conceivable they are presentable, and they have not been presented.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.3. Con: Multiverse theory attempts to resolve the origins of the universe by allowing random chance to compensate for the lack of a creator, but it fails to explain the source of the multiple universes. The question of a creator still remains.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.4. Con: No system has been proposed that would result in randomized laws, constants, and quantities in a multiverse.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.4.1. Pro: Although pseudo-random events seem to be common within our universe, due to unpredictable events and chaos theory, this would not apply outside of our universe without a similar system in place. We can't assume that randomness is the default state without reason.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.4.2. Pro: There is no theory in physics that explains how physical laws themselves would change or come into being, and so we have no basis on which to assume that this would happen at random in a multiverse.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: It could be argued that this would be outside of the jurisdiction of physics, since physics deals with the results of physical laws, not the laws themselves. No amount of understanding of physics can conclude *why* physics exists.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.4.2.2. Pro: By contrast to the multiverse, the god of classical theism would have the means to create and change physical laws due to its omnipotence.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.4.3. Pro: Perfect randomness may be a concept that could only exist within a mind.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.5. Con: If an infinite multiverse existed, then not only would implausible beings like Santa Claus and the Easter bunny exist, but so would every pagan/animist god and goddess. Therefore not only is a multiverse lower probability than virtually every religion, but belief in it entails beliefs in gods.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.5.1. Con: Santa Claus and the Easter bunny are only implausible within our universe. Their existence in other universes, where they may be perfectly plausible and probable, doesn't count as evidence against the multiverse theory.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.5.2. Con: Pagan gods existing in causally disconnected universes are irrelevant to our lives, and as such their existence can be safely ignored.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1.5.2.1. Con: Depending on how disconnected they actually are, if they have followers in this world, they are influenced by these Gods, and warrant attention.
1.4.3.1.3.1.2. Con: The fine-tuning argument carries the implied proposition that the universe is designed for life to exist, rather than assuming that life exists as a result of adapting to the universe.
1.4.3.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: The universe is so unimaginably immense, has existed and will exist for such a huge amount of time that it's not statistically impossible for the conditions for life to exist at least at some point of the universe, at some period of time.
1.4.3.1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: The argument from fine-tuning isn't concerned with the likelihood of life existing within the universe, but with the likelihood that the universe would exist in such a way that it permits life at all.
1.4.3.1.3.1.2.2. Con: The purpose of the universe is the conclusion of the fine-tuning argument, not any of its premises.
1.4.3.1.3.1.2.3. Pro: With an infinite amount of time \(including whatever existed before time started\), and an infinite number of universes, even low probability events become quite likely.
1.4.3.1.3.1.2.4. Con: The fine-tuning argument refers to constants and quantities that, if changed, would not allow for the formation of stars, matter, or complex chemistry, or else would result in near-instant heat death or collapse of the universe. It's clear that no universe such as these could support any form of life.
1.4.3.1.3.1.2.4.1. Con: Our current understanding of physics partially supports this claim, however our current understanding is incomplete and physical behavior if the constants were outside the goldilocks zone can only be extrapolated based on our incomplete understanding.
1.4.3.1.3.1.2.4.2. Con: The origin of these physical constants and the origin of the physical forces they apply to is unknown, there could be a common as yet undiscovered constant or variable controlling the values of these constants which can explain fine tuning without resorting to God.
1.4.3.1.3.1.2.4.2.1. Con: Arguments hinging on evidence that may be discovered in the future are exceedingly weak. The claim could be made that it's possible we'll discover a faraway planet with the entire New Testament carved into its side, so God almost certainly exists. We can't investigate arguments like these because we don't have the hypothetical evidence in front of us.
1.4.3.1.3.1.2.4.2.2. Con: Although a shared constant may lessen the amount of fine-tuning required, it would not eliminate it, since such a constant would itself be arbitrary and thus need to be finely tuned.
1.4.3.1.3.1.2.4.2.3. Pro: The fine tuning could stem from the theory of multiple/infinite daughter universes posed by quantum physics: there could be a universe with any configuration of forces, and the chances are one of these would have the correct values for our observable universe to exist as it does, as unlikely as it is
1.4.3.1.3.1.2.4.2.3.1. Con: This assumes that the values of the fundamental forces are assigned probabalistically, of which there is no evidence
1.4.3.1.3.1.2.4.2.3.2. Con: This assumes that the daughter universes theory is true, which has no evidence
1.4.3.1.3.1.2.5. Con: There is no contradiction between believing that the universe was fine-tuned to permit life to exist and that life arose naturally within the universe and adapted to its environment.
1.4.3.1.3.1.2.5.1. Con: The fine-tuning argument's conclusion that the universe was created to support life is what is contradicted by the idea that life exist by the sheer size of the universe, and ability of natural adaption to occur.
1.4.3.1.3.1.3. Pro: The Likelihood Principle states that if some observation O is likely under hypothesis A and less likely under hypothesis B, then O counts as evidence for A over B.

The existence of a life-permitting universe \(O\) is likely assuming a creator with the intent to create life \(A\), and less likely assuming the absence of such a creator \(B\).
1.4.3.1.3.1.3.1. Con: The Likelihood Principle is only useful on its own when the probability distribution over the hypothesis space is uniform. The model of the Universe being used which assigns that probability distribution is key: Creationism isn't the only model. The prior probability that there is a creator in the first place also needs to be taken into account.
1.4.3.1.3.1.3.1.1. Con: The previous argument didn't assume there was only one possibility. It explicitly allowed two: God's existence or non-existence.
1.4.3.1.3.1.3.1.2. Con: [Bayes rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) shows that the principle applies regardless of your prior.
1.4.3.1.3.1.3.1.3. Con: It not been established that the prior probability of God existing is so low that any evidence of God's existence can be ignored.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4. Con: The low amount of life found in the universe so far suggests that it is not particularly hospitable to life.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1. Pro: That the universe should be so vast while also being so uninhabited, argues against there being a god. If God exists, there should be more life, or less universe.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.1.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.2.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.3.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.4.1.1.1.4.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.6. Con: We don't have a good grasp on how much of the universe is inhabited.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.6.1. Con: We know that we haven't found life anywhere we've looked for it, and have looked in a lot of places.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.6.1.1. Con: To date we have only discovered [fewer than 4,000 exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet), which is a minuscule number compared to the expected amount.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.6.1.1.1. Con: 1 in 4000 is a speciously low hit rate for a god.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.6.1.2. Con: We don't yet have the technology to say with absolute certainty that any given planet or moon is lifeless, especially outside of our solar system.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.6.1.2.1. Con: If there is life there, it's nowhere near the level we are at.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.6.1.2.1.1. Con: We don't yet have [the technology needed](https://what-if.xkcd.com/47/) to detect civilizations like ours from interstellar distances.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.6.1.2.1.2. Con: A creator may not specifically prefer civilized technological life.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.6.1.2.1.2.1. Con: From this, one would necessarily conclude that God hates us. Although it seems consistent with other information, it's not a popular position.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.6.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: It's unclear how not having a specific, individual preference for something necessarily implies hatred.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.6.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: I don't always prefer pizza to burgers or vice versa, but that doesn't mean that I hate either or both.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.6.1.2.1.3. Con: The technology of an alien civilization may be unrecognizable to us.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.6.2. Pro: The space we consider as empty may be bursting with life in parallel dimensions.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7. Con: The universe may be infinitely large and contain an infinite number of inhabitants.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.1. Con: The universe is not infinitely large. It is expanding at the speed of light, but it not infinite. [We know this because we know that at the time of the big bang, all of space and time was limited to a single point.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/according-to-the-big-bang-1999-10-21/)
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.1.1. Con: [Certain measurements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe#Curvature_of_the_universe) imply that the curvature of the universe is flat, and a flat universe would likely be infinitely large.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.1.1.1. Con: All a flat universe implies is that it is expanding in different places. It is still finite in size from moment to moment.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.1.1.2. Pro: If the universe is Euclidean, which is the simplest shape that fits with its flatness, [then it is infinitely large](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe#Universe_with_zero_curvature).
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.1.1.3. Con: The world is flat enough that we can, for almost all purposes, treat it as flat, but is still a sphere, it's just really big, [this is how integers work](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/integration-definite.html), by dividing the data up until there is local flatness, the same thing could be true of the universe, we might just be to small to see the curves.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.1.1.3.1. Con: Curvature gets smaller at smaller scales, but doesn't disappear completely. This doesn't fit with the data - namely, that absolutely no global curvature has been detected in the universe.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.1.1.3.1.1. Con: The data may not be precise enough to answer this question.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.1.2. Con: The size \(infinite or finite\) of the universe is [currently unanswered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe#Infinite_or_finite) by cosmology. It hasn't been proven by the existence of the Big Bang.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.1.2.1.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.2. Con: Even if the universe had an infinite number of inhabitants, that would not explain the lack of density of life.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.1.1.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.4. Pro: If the universe has an infinite number of inhabitants, there couldn't even conceivably be any more. A God who only prefers a large number of inhabitants would therefore be satisfied.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.4.1. Con: There are levels of infinity, some are quite bigger then others, for example, the set of real numbers includes the set of natural numbers.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.4.1.1. Con: Uncountable infinity cannot be reached from countable infinity by addition or multiplication, which is what would occur if the density of creatures in an infinitely large universe increased.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.4.1.1.1. Pro: [Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel) shows that adding to or even doubling the number of inhabitants filling an infinitely large space doesn't actually increase that number.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.4.1.1.2. Pro: Uncountable infinity refers to sets that can be separated into infinitely smaller amounts, such as the set of all rational numbers between 1 and 2. It doesn't apply to counting whole entities, such as living inhabitants of a universe.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.4.1.2. Con: This [doesn't apply to all infinities](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/59138.html). For instance, there are as many even integers as there are all integers, because the even integers are defined as being any integer multiplied by 2 - despite it intuitively seeming as if there should be only half as many even integers.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.4.1.2.1. Pro: The presented example does show the problem of density, the number of even integers is clearly less dense then the number of all integers.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.7.5. Pro: We can destroy all life on our planet. If God favors life, He would not keep all eggs in the same basket.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.8. Con: The universe could be so vast so that the life that is there has a place to grow into.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.9. Con: The universe being so vast and relatively uninhabited is not an argument against God's existence. At best it is an argument that you would have created the universe differently than God did.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.2. Pro: The universe does not appear to be fine tuned for life. It appears to be better tuned for making black holes.
1.4.3.1.3.1.4.3. Con: In the context of this argument a hospitable universe is one that supports life, not necessarily produces life.
1.4.3.1.3.1.5. Con: -> See 1.4.2.2.2.1.2.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6. Pro: Purpose-based inductive reasoning is used all the time. For instance, it is far more likely that a log cabin in the woods resulted from a man chopping down trees to build a home, rather than a series of nearby trees falling in a very specific pattern.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1. Con: The problem with this line of thinking is that you still need to explain where the human came from. The reason the log cabin was likely constructed by a man chopping down trees is because there is evidence of the existence of a man, but there is no evidence for the existence of a God.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1. Con: Even if a structure was discovered in the middle of a desert which was thought uninhabited, or on an uncolonized planet, it is still more rational to conclude that at least one sentient creature lives there than that the structure formed by random chance.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1. Con: The probability of a complex creator is much lower than the probability of a life-permitting universe with no creator.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: The arguments related to the [Ultimate Boeing 747 Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Boeing_747_gambit) provides some insight into why a complex creator is less likely than no creator.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The classical God is a disembodied mind. Since the universe already contains at least 7 billion other minds, and has contained many more over its lifetime, God is clearly not significantly more complex than the universe.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Many religions consider God to be omniscient,  omnipotent and omnipresent. Each of these qualities requires the God to be at least as much and possibly significantly more complex than the universe which is predicted, controlled or embodied by God.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: God as classically defined is perfectly simple. Knowledge, power and location do not require complexity if they are absolute and unchanging. God is not relative to the universe.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.2. Pro: In terms of probability, P\(life-permitting universe and sentient designer\) \< P\(sentient designer\) \< P\(life-permitting universe\). Of course P\(life-permitting universe given sentient designer\) is very high, but we have not been given the existence of the designer, that is what the debate is about.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The relevant probabilities are P\(life-permitting universe|designer\) and P\(life-permitting universe|¬designer\). According to the Likelihood Principle, if the former is more likely than the latter, then that counts as evidence for the existence of a designer.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.1.3.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: What we have for certain is a life-permitting universe, and we are estimating the probability of the designer. 
Let Designer be D and Universe be U
1. P\(D|U\) = P\(D ∩ U\)/P\(U\)
and 
2. P\(¬D|U\) = P\(¬D ∩ U\)/P\(U\)
since the P\(U\) term is common in both 1 and 2, the higher of  P\(D ∩ U\) and  P\(¬D ∩ U\) determines which is more likely.
formulating in terms of P\(U|D\):
P\(D ∩ U\) = P\(U|D\)*P\(D\)
P\(¬D ∩ U\) = P\(U|¬D\)*P\(¬D\)
P\(U|D\) \>\> P\(U|¬D\)  does not automatically lead to P\(D|U\) \> P\(¬D|U\) if P\(D\) \<\< P\(¬D\)
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Given physical calculations involving the life-permitting ranges of physical constants, P\(U|¬D\) seems to be vanishingly small - so much so that any realistic prior value given to P\(D\) still works for this argument.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Just one initial condition of the universe - the mass and energy distribution of the singularity - is fine-tuned to a precision of [1/10^\(10^123\)](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yX6591VNz4IC&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=Initial+condition+of+the+universe+123&source=bl&ots=yNnnKSWrm4&sig=5jP22gIyUrDaCZKlac8qIGTT4nI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjcudrHjsvZAhXGJsAKHXhVCz0Q6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&q&f=false). No intellectually honest non-theist would claim that the prior probability of God's existence is significantly lower than that, especially considering that this mind-boggling improbability is raised multiplicatively with many other similarly large figures.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: It's not obvious that P\(D\) \<\< P\(¬D\), at least to an extent relevant to this discussion.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: P\(D\), or more specifically P\(D|k\) where k is our background knowledge, is raised significantly by other arguments for God's existence, as well as historical and anecdotal evidence.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: In the original claim U is considered to be  the same as K in this claim and therefore P\(D\) doesn't change because of any other information, they have already been factored into the formulation.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.2.1.2.3. Con: The Likelihood Principle only claims that the data counts as evidence - that is, it raises P\(D\) \(and thereby lowers P\(¬D\), since P\(D\) + P\(¬D\) = 1 by the law of the excluded middle\) - not that it necessarily demonstrates that the hypothesis is the more likely one, or P\(D\) \> P\(¬D\).
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.2. Con: The primary flaw in this argument is that we are trying to ascribe the existence of a partially complex object by claiming the existence of a significantly more complex being. This raises the question of the origin of the creator which is an infinite regress.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.2.1. Con: Proposing an explanation for some data doesn't require an explanation for that explanation. When arguing that a certain death was a murder rather than an accident, one doesn't need to explain the murderer's diet, place of birth, and current living conditions before making the claim.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.2.1.1. Con: This analogy is not appropriate because there is irrefutable evidence for the existence of murderers, making the existence of murder a likely possibility and the origin of the murderer irrelevant. The existence of God however has not been irrefutably proven, hence the origin of God is key if the hypothesis that God exists is accepted without irrefutable evidence.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Why doesn't that explanation need an explanation? If one suggests that complex things need a creator, you need to explain why the creator doesn't need a creator, otherwise you have created an infinite loop which means eventually "something" comes from "nothing", thus circumventing the need for God at all as a possible explanation.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.1.1.
1.4.3.1.3.1.6.2. Con: We only know this to be the case because we can compare naturally occuring objects with objects we know to be designed. If all things were designed, the cabin would be a single cabin in a world of other cabins, and there would be no undesigned objects to compare the cabin to. We recognize design because we know what things that weren't designed look like.
1.4.3.1.3.1.7. Pro: Some interpret [biological structuralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism_\(biology\)) to support a creator, as they argue it requires physical constants to be [fine tuned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYRvujeUFE) to enable the life forms we see.
1.4.3.1.3.1.7.1. Pro: According to process structuralism, biological systems would be a bit like crystals, in that they're likely to form and propagate wherever conditions are right \(instead of only in individual, random circumstances\).
1.4.3.1.3.1.7.2. Pro: Since the adaptation and shape of life would result directly from the physical laws of the universe, process structuralism suggests that if the universe is fine-tuned, it's not just for life - it's fine-tuned for exactly the type of life that exists, and for humans as well.
1.4.3.1.3.1.7.2.1. Con: Saying because we observe a form of life, the universe must be made for that type of life is equivalent to saying because a random number generator happened to spit out a random sequence of numbers in one instance, it must be made to spit out that particular string of numbers. It might make sense to say something like it was made to make a recognizable pattern if we happen to see a pattern we recognize, but not to say it was made for that pattern, even by the pattern logic.
1.4.3.1.3.1.8. Con: The [anthropic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle) observes that, for conscious beings to wonder about the possibility of their existence in the universe, conscious beings must exist in the first place. Therefore, asking such a question is pointless because the fact of asking it implies a positive answer.
1.4.3.1.3.1.8.1. Con: The anthropic principle doesn't have any explanatory power. Take the analogy of a man sentenced to death by firing squad, who finds after all the shots are fired that each trained marksman missed him entirely. If he had died he wouldn't have been able to wonder about the situation, but the fact that such a thing happened clearly doesn't make it less unlikely or less requiring of an explanation.
1.4.3.1.3.1.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.1.3.
1.4.3.1.3.1.8.1.2. Pro: The fact that we can know a certain event happened only gives us certainty that it happened, not why it happened. The latter is what the fine-tuning argument is concerned with.
1.4.3.1.3.1.8.2. Con: The anthropic principle, when used correctly, only applies to scenarios where there are many possible spaces observers could occupy, but only a few wherein observers could actually come to exist/survive. For instance, it's pointless to wonder why we find ourselves on a planet with liquid water, rather than another planet - if there were no liquid water, we couldn't exist. The same doesn't apply here, where no probability spaces other than our universe are known to exist.
1.4.3.1.3.1.8.3. Con: The ability to ask a question doesn't factor into whether the question is meaningful. I can ask why my parents got together, even though if they hadn't I wouldn't be able to ask such a question - there is still a meaningful explanation for their getting together.
1.4.3.1.3.1.9. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.2.
1.4.3.1.3.1.10. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.
1.4.3.1.3.1.11. Con: It's possible that the constants actually have only one possible value, which would mean the universe couldn't be tuned for life or anything else
1.4.3.1.3.1.11.1. Con: The constants referred to are [dimensionless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_physical_constant), meaning their value doesn't depend on any other value or measurement. It's unclear how these values couldn't be different.
1.4.3.1.3.1.11.2. Con: The initial quantities of the universe, such as the mass/energy distribution and the entropy of the singularity, are also very finely tuned - but there is no obvious reason to believe that the contents of the universe could not have been different.
1.4.3.1.3.1.11.3. Con: No argument has been given for the logical impossibility of a different set of physical laws. In the absence of such an argument, our default assumption should be that since a physically different universe is conceivable, it is possible.
1.4.3.1.3.1.11.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.2.2.
1.4.3.1.3.1.11.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.2.3.
1.4.3.1.3.1.11.4. Pro: As far as we know, the universal constants are constant. There is absolutely no evidence to suggest any other value is possible. Therefore, variations are not probable
1.4.3.1.3.1.11.4.1. Con: Asserting that variations are not probable because we are aware of no evidence to suggest other possibilities is a non sequitur. One could as easily say, "We have no evidence to suggest that the universal constants must necessarily have their known values, therefore variations are probable." 

Neither position is warranted.
1.4.3.1.3.1.11.5. Con: The possibility of having only one possible set of constants does not imply the plausibility of such a universe. We have no warrant to reject the possibility of other values for these constants without evidence that such a constraint exists.
1.4.3.1.3.1.11.6. Con: This does not refute the finely-tuned relationships between the constants that are required support life. In fact, with only one chance to get it right, the fact that the universe supports life would be even more miraculous.
1.4.3.1.3.1.12. Con: My existence in our universe would be impossible if any number of laws, constants, and initial conditions were changed even unimaginably slightly. Following the logic of the above statement, it would imply the strong probability that the universe was created for the purpose of harboring me!
1.4.3.1.3.1.12.1. Con: As a member of the set of "life", the argument is expected to apply just as well to you as to any other creature or to life as a whole.
1.4.3.1.3.1.12.2. Con: A theist would typically agree that the universe was made for the purpose of hosting you, in a sense, since God has an individual purpose for everyone.
1.4.3.1.3.1.13. Con: People are bad at understanding probabilities, and this is formalised as the Lottery Fallacy. The chance of me winning the lottery is astronomically small, but every week or so someone has a big win.
1.4.3.1.3.1.13.1. Con: The problem of fine-tuning isn't based on popular understanding of probability, but on formal probability such as the Likelihood Principle and Bayes' Theorem. [See here](https://calumsblog.com/2017/07/25/full-defence-of-the-fine-tuning-argument-part-3/) for an in-depth explanation of the logic behind it.
1.4.3.1.3.1.13.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.1.3.
1.4.3.1.3.1.14. Con: We have no reason to assume that the values a universal constant could take are equally likely. we cannot say anything about the probability that
1.4.3.1.3.1.14.1. Con: Without a mechanism proposed to explain the universal constants, sharing equal probability space is the simplest explanation. To assert anything else without solid reason is ad hoc.
1.4.3.1.3.1.15. Con: There are [other known sets of laws of physics congenial to life](http://web.uni-plovdiv.bg/marta/life_in_the_multiverse.pdf), that have significant difference to our own, including ones with an entire fundamental force missing and these lie in the tiny region of laws of physics we're able to conceive of and simulate.
1.4.3.1.3.1.16. Con: [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) shows that life like phenomenon can emerge from radical different "laws of physics". The hostility of similar laws to our own in no way extrapolates to laws distinct from our own. As such it's possible that most laws pass the level of congeniality to life, and we just exist in an island surrounded by hostility.
1.4.3.1.3.1.17. Con: Suppose the universe was created for the sole purpose of creating life, our lives specifically. It is just as likely that humans, or some other race, advanced technologically far enough at some point in the future to crack time and dimension travel and go back before the Big Bang to make it happen ourselves knowing that we wouldn't ever exist without it, as it is that there is a God. We could be our own gods by creating a time-loop paradox. The fact is, there is no way to know yet.
1.4.3.1.4. Con: This cycles back to the original thesis of proof for God's existence and does not reach an end in itself.
1.4.3.2. Con: Some things have meaning, order and design.  Many things do not.  The teleological argument for God's existence makes the mistake of assuming that the traits of some objects must belong to all objects. That assumption is not justified.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: That the universe has purpose is the conclusion of the teleological arguments, not one of their premises.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.1.2.1.1.3.
1.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.1.
1.4.3.4. Con: Teleological arguments based on the existence of specific things are nullified if natural explanations are discovered for those things.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: Many teleological arguments are from the complexity and diversity of life. These arguments have been disproven by the discovery of evolution, which can explain the appearance of life without a divine designer.
1.4.3.4.1.1. Con: Evolution does not explain the appearance of life - rather only how it changes and adapts. The appearance of life is referred to as [abiogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis). At present there is no single generally accepted model for abiogenesis.
1.4.3.4.1.1.1. Con: given what we know of the world before, and after that point, this argument seems equivalent to the famous 'missing link' argument, while this is something we need to work on, it seems that in order for simple facts to be accepted by some, we must map out the location of every proton from the start of the universe to present.
1.4.3.4.1.2. Con: Biological evolution, if true, still requires that the laws of physics and chemistry be in a very particular form. If they were even slightly different, evolution would likely be impossible. So that evolution is even possible implies a teleology to the natural order.
1.4.3.4.1.2.1. Con: This isn't necessarily true. If the laws of physics or chemistry were different, we may have simply seen a different form of love evolved to function in the universe as it would be under different circumstances. There is no way to evaluate the probability of this being plausible or implausible.
1.4.3.4.1.2.2. Con: The particularity of forms do not imply or necessitate "purpose" or teleological meaning.
1.4.3.4.1.3. Con: This is assuming macro-evolution is indeed true, which is, itself, an unverifiable theory based on conjecture and estimations.
1.4.3.4.1.3.1. Con: The unprovability of science is a myth based on a failure of our education system to properly communicate the scientific method.
1.4.3.4.1.3.2. Con: There are [multiple](http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/pdf/1861_OriginNY_F382.pdf) [sources](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150803-how-do-we-know-evolution-is-real) which contradict the idea that macro-evolution is an unverifiable theory.
1.4.3.4.1.3.2.1. Con: Both sources are biased towards a particular outcome, and are thus unreliable.

The BBC piece itself admits that current research methods into evolutionary science are yet incomplete to fully determine how distinct species can somehow transition into an entirely distinct species.
1.4.3.4.2. Con: Here John Lennox's [arguments](http://augustinecollective.org/god-in-mathematics-and/) come into play. A natural explanation based on laws is unsatisfactory unless we know how those laws were put in place. Laws come from lawgivers.
1.4.3.4.2.1. Con: Equating cosmological constants to laws dictated by minds is a false equivalence. Natural "laws" are not dictated rules that must not be broken. They are observations about the natural world.something that simply is does not indicate a need for someone who declares it to be that way.
1.4.3.4.3. Pro: The absence of a presently adequate explanation is not reason to assume there is no adequate natural explanation. Every explanation we currently have was true and adequate before we understood it.
1.4.3.4.4. Con: This argument does not follow because "natural explanations" and "teleology" are not mutually exclusive. Natural explanations can only answer the question, "How?" but teleology addresses, "To what end?"
1.4.3.4.5. Con: So far such natural explanations have not been found \(i.e. modern evolutionary theory and the precise assignation of the values of the fundamental forces\)
1.4.3.5. Con: Teleological arguments are [god-of-the-gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps) arguments. This makes them a kind of [argument from ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance).
1.4.3.5.1. Con: Not all are 'God of the Gaps' arguments, because some point to features of the world, e.g. order and regularity in the universe, that not only aren't explained by current science, but couldn't even in principle be explained scientifically at all.
1.4.3.6. Con: Charles Darwin refutes the Teleological Argument. "The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered."

1.4.3.6.1. Pro: Richard Dawkins [refutes](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-dawkins/why-there-almost-certainl_b_32164.html) the Teleological Argument. "Natural selection is so stunningly powerful and elegant, it not only explains the whole of life, it raises our consciousness and boosts our confidence in science's future ability to explain everything else"
1.4.3.6.2. Con: The Theory of Evolution doesn't cover the entire scope of the teleological argument.  Arguments like fine-tuning via the cosmological constant or nuclear force, the strength of gravity etc, cannot be answered by evolution, because evolution has organized matter as a presupposition, but without these features, there is no organized matter.
1.4.3.6.3. Con: Natural selection can only act upon the random variation that occurs in the genetic code.  The Modern Synthesis of Evolution has been challenged upon the grounds that the random variation does not have the probabilistic resources sufficient to explain either [functional proteins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283604007624), or [larger complex features](https://www.witpress.com/elibrary/dne-volumes/4/2/399).
1.4.3.6.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.4.
1.4.3.7. Pro: Arguments from [consciousness](http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/theistic-proofs/the-teleological-argument/the-argument-from-consciousness/) support the existence of God.
1.4.3.7.1. Pro: Adams \(1992\) and Swinburne \(1979\) [argue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_consciousness) deductively from the disjunction  that mental events either have a personal or natural scientific explanation. Given that mental events are genuinely nonphysical, a personal explanation demonstrates the mental and physical event type correlations. If the explanation is personal, then it is theistic.
1.4.3.7.1.1. Con: Mental events are thoughts, which are the product of mind, an emergent property of brain. They are very physical.
1.4.3.7.1.2. Con: Deductive reasoning presumes accurate premises. The non-physical nature of 'mental events' is not a premise with any backing, thus nullifying the deduction.
1.4.3.7.2. Pro: The ability to reason must be a dispensation from a higher being because it can't come from the irrational.
1.4.3.7.2.1. Pro: As [C. S. Lewis identified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_reason) arguing from reason that God doesn't exists means someone has to  "ask me to accept a conclusion while discrediting the only testimony upon which that conclusion can be based" because irrational processes can't produce the ability to reason.
1.4.3.7.2.1.1. Con: Evolution is the only thing we know has ever produced reason, and lacks any mind or rationality.
1.4.3.7.3. Pro: As philosophers like Nagel, Levine and Chalmers have shown, conscious states cannot be identified with physical / natural states. Hence, conscious states are incompatible with physicalism/naturalism, though they are compatible with theism. Thus, conscious states give us reason to prefer theism over physicalism/naturalism.
1.4.3.7.3.1. Con: As [most philosophers are physicalists](https://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP), Nagel, Levine and Chalmers do not seem to have sufficiently shown this.
1.4.3.8. Con: The teleological argument has repeatedly been demonstrated to be fallacious and invalid. The appearance of design can arise through natural processes and this appears to be the case with living organisms, stars, crystals and other supposed evidences of design. In fact the opposite appears to be true: all so-called intentional design arises from physical laws acting on human brains and bodies and thus arises naturally as well. There is no evidence that unnatural design is possible.
1.4.3.9. Pro: The universe is way too complex and intricate for it to have been a product of pure coincidence. Our bodies are organisms that function as a microcosms, with everything being coded in our DNA from head to bottom. The multiplicity of species, of systems, of connections, and nexuses between things don't just fall into place on their own. A Supreme Being put them together so that they could function autonomously with everything having an exact role and function.
1.4.3.9.1. Con: The fact that a natural explanation for a phenomenon isn't currently known \(even when this is true\) is poor evidence that no natural explanation exists.
1.4.3.9.1.1. Pro: This is often phrased as "God of the gaps." When science explains all the gaps, there is no more God.
1.4.3.9.1.2. Pro: At one time it was believed that the animacy of living things was inexplicable to science and could only be explained by an irreducible [élan vital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lan_vital); this was obviously false, as biology has shown itself reducible to ordinary physical processes.
1.4.3.9.2. Con: The complexity of biology is not consistent with the work of an intelligent designer.  There are many evolutionary "wrong turns" that make sense in the context of natural selection, but not in the context of intelligent design.

For example, it makes no sense for an intelligent designer to make lizards with vestigial \(non-functioning\) eyes.  However, the vestigial eyes make sense as an adaptation to the pitch-dark cave environment the lizards inhabit.
1.4.3.9.2.1. Con: According to Christianity, initially creation was good, but then creation was cursed, bringing death into the world. With this understanding of our current place in history there is plenty of room for imperfect creations.

For example: God makes lizards with functioning eyes, then the world gets bad, then the lizards go underground, and after natural selection, we have lizards with blind eyes.
1.4.3.9.2.1.1. Con: This argument uses natural selection to explain the existence of vestigial organs and concedes that vestigial organs are not consistent with an explanation by intelligent design. 

"Cursed creation" cannot possibly explain all examples.  For instance, avian species form a yolk sac during the course of their development, while mammals form and then degrade a yolk sac.  Yolk sac formation in mammals is consistent with an evolutionary hold-over, but not consistent with a "cursed creation."
1.4.3.9.2.2. Con: To claim an evolutionary wrong turn creates a false equivalency between man and God. If God intentionally created lizards with vestigial eyes, who are we then to call that a mistake? Our limited capacity for understanding can often cap our sense of perspective. Modern science has yet to come to a consensus on why we yawn or the function of one's appendix, but this does not mean they are fundamentally meaningless or inherently flawed.
1.4.3.9.2.2.1. Con: Evolution can explain these wrong turns quite well, there vistiua traits made to solve a form of a problem that doesn't exist, and not adapt to what they are currently needed to do.
1.4.3.9.2.2.2. Con: There are apparent contradictions in biology between form and function.  Many species have vestigial organs which perform no apparent function.  From a molecular standpoint, many species posses genes which have been silenced, but which still function in ancestor species.  While intelligent design cannot provide an explanation for these apparent contradictions, the theory of evolution by natural selection is consistent with these apparent contradictions.
1.4.3.9.2.3. Con: Complex biology and organisms could have been created by an Intelligent Designer and later have natural selection act on them.
1.4.3.9.2.4. Con: Natural selection could be a mechanism established by the Designer to ensure His creation's adaptation and survival.
1.4.3.9.2.5. Pro: The eye is a good example of suboptimal design. A liquid filled eye in a gaseous environment is less effective than a gas filled eye in a gaseous environment. Evolutionists believe this happened because the eye evolved in aquatic animals first. It seems a theist would be left to believe god chose to make humans sub-optimally or lacked the ability to make a gas filled eye.
1.4.3.9.2.5.1. Pro: The issue is one of [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction), when light passes from our gas filled environment to a liquid filled eye, the light distorts. The human brain adapts but our vision could be better without the refraction problem.
1.4.3.9.3. Pro: DNA is understood universally to be an extremely complex code that details every aspect of an organism's appearance, behavior, and physical description. Any code that precisely conducts a complex set of commands with regard to computers and technology is understood to have an author who wrote it. Yet, the most complex code in existence - DNA - supposedly just wrote itself. This defies basic logic and common sense.
1.4.3.9.3.1. Con: There is nothing contradictory about complex systems arising from random chance.
1.4.3.9.3.2. Con: Each gene describes a protein or number of proteins that will be expressed by an organism.  In fact, if we look across species, we can observe a series of gradual changes to the same genes, causing modifications to the expressed proteins.  We can also observe that some genes, while still expressed in species of early origin, are silenced in species of later origin.  In summary, evidence for the natural selection of genetic change exists.
1.4.3.9.3.3. Con: Your inability to comprehend how DNA could arise through natural processes is not evidence that didn't happen. It's an argument from personal incredulity. Plenty of people do understand how this could have occurred. It is a false equivalence fallacy to assume that because one complex code has an author that all complex codes have an author. Complexity is not the component that implies authorship.
1.4.3.9.3.3.1. Con: Origin of life studies continue, but we still do not understand how the first life came to exist.  At the time of this writing, this has not been demonstrated in a lab, nor has it been observed in nature.
1.4.3.9.3.3.2. Con: DNA is a language, in the same way that a computer language is a language, complete with syntax, punctuation, phrases, etc. and has a high level of specified complexity.

No other known code with a similar level of specified complexity has ever been discovered that was not designed and created by an intelligent agent. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the DNA code has an author.
1.4.3.9.3.4. Con: Without comprehensive examples of complex systems which were not authored/designed, we cannot know with certainty the nature of such systems.
1.4.3.9.3.5. Con: The [appeal to common sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_fallacy) is a known logical fallacy.
1.4.3.9.3.6. Con: Software applying evolutionary algorithms has proven to be able to design complex designs beyond the [capability \(and sometimes understanding\) of humans](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/st-5/main/04-55AR.html) without being intelligent or conscious.
1.4.3.9.3.7. Con: A chain of DNA can be extraordinary long, but there are only four possible rungs on the ladder that vary along its length. It may contain vast information, but it is simple in its constituent parts.
1.4.3.9.4. Con: -> See 1.4.3.9.3.1.
1.4.3.9.5. Con: The quality known as "complexity" is relative to the limits of  human language and intellect. The laws of the universe appear to be complex, and they require sophisticated language to communicate, but this is only proves that humans struggle to explain the universe.  This fact communicates nothing about the origin of the universe.
1.4.3.9.6. Con: Complexity is not synonymous with intention.
1.4.3.9.6.1. Pro: A hallmark of intentional creation is simplicity, not complexity. It is the lack of redundant features for achieving a purpose that starts to point to design.
1.4.3.9.7. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.1.
1.4.3.9.8. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.1.6.1.1.2.
1.4.3.9.9. Con: Our universe is not a product of random coincidences. Evolution is a result of cumulative selection guided by natural selection. The only random aspect is random mutation in gene replication. Each aspect moving backwards from the formation of ecosystems, planets, stars, the universe itself have similar explanations that do not come down to coincidence.
1.4.3.9.9.1. Pro: Our understanding of genetics and mutation adequately explain minor changes through the course of reproduction.
1.4.3.9.9.2. Con: To claim that natural selection is "well understood" minimizes the breadth of data and research that can never be done since institutions of higher learning have only sprung up recently. Processes that take billions of years can be surmised, hypothesized, and even generally accepted, but they are not well understood.
1.4.3.9.9.2.1. Con: Bacteria and other microorganisms have extremely short lifespans and thus evolution through natural selection can-and has been- directly observed.
1.4.3.9.9.3. Con: Natural selection cannot explain the origins of the first cell from which life sprang, nor can it explain how a system whereby ancestors pass their genes on to their offspring in a way that allows for minor changes to be replicated through a population came to exist in the first place.
1.4.3.9.9.3.1. Pro: The origin of the first cell is outside the scope of evolution, just as the origin of the sun is.
1.4.3.9.9.3.2. Con: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis)
There is a lot that is known about the origin of life from lifeless matter. Along with a handful of completely plausible hypotheses on the origin of life from lifeless matter through exclusively physical events.
1.4.3.9.10. Con: In the creationism/evolution debate, they said the eye and wing were to complicated for evolution to explain, but [we explained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye) [them](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/flight/evolve.html).
1.4.3.10. Pro: [All things](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/bofm/alma/30) denote there is a God. The laws that are in our universe [dennote](https://www.lds.org/languages/eng/content/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2)there is a God.
1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.
1.4.5. Pro: The [simulation hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis) holds that reality is simulated by an external being, and there is good reason to believe that such a being would be the classical God.
1.4.5.1. Pro: It is likely that our universe is simulated.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: If entities capable of, and willing to, simulating universes are able to develop, then simulated universes are [likely to outnumber real ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis). According to the [Copernican principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle), we likely exist in the least special, or most numerous, type of surroundings that can support observers. As such, we likely exist in a simulated universe.
1.4.5.1.1.1. Con: Such a being wouldn't necessarily meet the classical definition of God \(omnibenevolence, timelessness, simplicity, transcendence, immutability, etc\).
1.4.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.14.
1.4.5.2. Pro: The entity simulating our universe is God \(theological [idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism)\).
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: Consciousnesses such as ours cannot be simulated in a computer, but only within another consciousness - a mind.
1.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.3.1.1.1.
1.4.5.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.3.6.9.3.1.1.2.
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: There are three broad types of things that may be simulating our universe: a quantum computer in a universe such as ours \(see Bostrom's ancestor simulation hypothesis\), a classical computer in a classical universe, or a mind. We do not ultimately exist in either a quantum or classical computer, so we must exist in a mind.
1.4.5.2.2.1. Pro: An ancestor simulation or other simulation within a quantum computer would have to exist in a quantum world very similar or identical to ours. According to the law of [indiscernibility of identicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles), if our universe is likely simulated, then any identical universe is also likely simulated. So any quantum simulation must itself ultimately exist within a mind.
1.4.5.2.2.2. Pro: In order for a classical computer to simulate a universe it must contain as many states as the universe it is simulating, and thus be larger than it. A computer larger than our universe would be incredibly inefficient and impractical to build for any entity or civilization that isn't omnipotent. Therefore, we are not simulated in a classical computer.
1.4.5.2.2.2.1. Con: A simulated universe/reality could be much smaller than the entire universe that we believe exists, such as a simulation of only our Solar System.
1.4.5.2.2.2.2. Con: A simulated universe could drastically simplify many aspects of the universe if the simulators were not interested in them; most stars could be modelled as perfect spheres with the properties expected of those stars without us being any the wiser.
1.4.5.2.2.3. Con: Even if we exist in some kind of a mind, there is no reason to call that mind "God".
1.4.5.2.3. Con: The simulation could be created by a species not that much more advanced than humans.
1.4.5.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.1.1.1.
1.4.5.2.4. Con: Your mind of this moment, complete with memories, could have multiple instantiations over time or on different computers, with different owners or multiple owners. They are not the classical God.
1.4.5.2.5. Con: It is not likely that God would need a simulation of reality when it has the ability create reality.
1.4.5.3. Con: The simulation hypothesis seems to be untestable, which means it doesn't provide a reliable path to the truth about the existence of an entity simulating our universe, leave alone that this entity is a god.
1.4.5.4. Con: The simulation hypothesis is an independent hypothesis from the god hypothesis, and it does not support or detract from it.
1.4.5.4.1. Con: Both hypotheses have far-reaching implications over an entire worldview if one believes in them, and for the hypotheses to be truly independent, those implications would have to \(improbably\) never interact.
1.4.5.5. Con: The simulation hypothesis was created specifically to avoid invoking any deities to explain our existence.
1.4.5.6. Con: This does not escape the necessity of explaining God's existence.
1.4.5.6.1. Con: There is no necessity of explaining Gods existence.  The discussion is on if “God exists”, not why God exists.
1.4.5.7. Con: The universe as it exists cannot be simulated.
1.4.5.7.1. Con: Our universe could be easily simulated in reality based on higher number of dimensions, just as for us it's much easier to simulate 2D.
1.4.5.8. Con: The simulation hypothesis involves rationalising things outside the universe as if they were within the universe, there is no evidence to suggest this is valid.
1.4.5.9. Pro: Within a simulation, origin notwithstanding, a non-human designer may be omnipotent, omniscient, for all intents and purposes omnipresent, and perfectly benevolent.
1.4.5.9.1. Con: This is begging the question. There is no reason provided to explain why a designer would be inherently benevolent. Following your logic, God is God to me as Will Wright is God to [the Sims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims); yet, even in that context, we'd be hard-pressed to call Mr. Wright omnipotent, omniscient, and omni-benevolent, even relative to the Sims themselves these attributes are vacuous.
1.4.5.9.2. Con: They *may* be these things, but our universe does not appear as if it were designed or managed by one who is omnipotent and perfectly benevolent.
1.4.5.10. Con: The simulator would not have the personal awareness of each human being that the classical God has. Nor the absolute goodness, mercy, etc
1.4.5.10.1. Con: At least in the case of "personal awareness of each human being", if the simulator's mind is running on hardware comparable to what it's using to run the simulation, there's no reason it couldn't have such extensive knowledge.
1.4.5.11. Pro: The universe itself was created by an intelligent mind out of a informational model.
1.4.5.11.1. Pro: Intelligent minds exist \(Humans for example\) and can create informational model's of the universe \(like string theory\).
1.4.5.11.2. Pro: [Digital physics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_physics) implies that the universe is fundamentally information.
1.4.5.12. Con: We could be very well simulated in the sense that we are a mathematical model that can be expressed in a mathematical universe. No consciousness is required to simulate us.
1.4.5.13. Con: It is hubris to suggest that only Omnipotence could simulate \(or create\) reality as we know it. It's possible that between man and God \(should such exist\) there could be any number of beings capable of such.
1.4.5.14. Con: There is no "good reason" to believe such a being would be the classical God. 
The statement also assumes the "classical God" in question is the Christian one,  \(and not - say - the Hindu one\), nothing suggests that humans are created in "his" image.
1.4.5.14.1. Con: This argument is simply detracting from the semantics of the argument and not addressing whether the hypothesis actually supports the existence of a higher entity regardless of if it is regarded as a "classic God" or not.
1.4.5.14.1.1. Con: In a debate over whether God exists, it's not mere semantics to point out that some nebulous "higher entity" is not necessarily God.
1.4.5.15. Pro: -> See discussion #9858: We exist within a [Simulated Reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_reality).
1.4.5.16. Con: The simulation hypothesis is currently a matter of debate itself. Evidence that its predictions from matematics and theoretical physics are supported by observation is still missing, so it can't be used further than to claim "It may be a simulation". Even if it where true, the starter of the simulation might have finite computational resources, which would be incompatible with an omnipotent God
1.4.6. Con: Agnosticism holds that the lack of evidence makes it impossible to know whether God exists.
1.4.6.1. Con: There is no reason to think why we, in principle, could not know. It might be the case that if all the arguments in favor of God's existence are not on balance enough to justify belief that we do not know, but there is no reason that we could not possibly know.
1.4.6.2. Pro: Justified belief in the claim "God Exists" requires relevant, compelling evidence.
Because there is no such evidence, belief in the claim "God Exists" should be withheld.
1.4.6.2.1. Con: There is good reason to believe that God exists.
1.4.6.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.
1.4.6.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.
1.4.6.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.4.6.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.4.6.2.1.5. Pro: If one has taken none of the necessary steps to know God, one cannot claim that He cannot be known.
1.4.6.2.1.5.1. Con: Many atheists come from religious families and/or have backgrounds backgrounds and have taken various steps in search of truth regarding God, eventually arriving at the conclusion that there is no valid reason to believe that God exists.
1.4.6.2.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.4.6.2.1.7. Con: The teleological, moral, ontological, and cosmological arguments have repeatedly been demonstrated to be fallacious and invalid.
1.4.6.2.1.7.1. Con: It is only accepted among atheists that the arguments in favor of God's existence are demonstrated to be fallacious. It remains hotly contested that these arguments have \(all\) been shown to be false.
1.4.6.2.1.7.1.1. Con: William Lane Craig, a professional philosopher and one of the foremost living Christian apologists, has infamously attested that his belief in God is ultimately grounded in the "inner witness of the Holy Spirit," with evidence and rational argument playing a subsidiary role. This suggests that religious apologists will continue to believe in God and contest the validity of these arguments even if they are demonstrably fallacious.
1.4.6.2.1.7.1.2. Con: The other half of that coin is: it is only among theists that the arguments in favor of God's existence are not demonstrated to be fallacious. It is yet to be shown that any of those arguments is sound, all of them having the validity of their premises or assumptions hotly contested.
1.4.6.2.1.7.1.3. Con: This argument is disjointed from what it is replying to. If not all arguments in favour of God's existence are false, then it does not follow that any subset of arguments are true.
1.4.6.2.1.7.2. Con: This is a response to certain philosophical arguments and not all philosophical arguments, as such this is disjointed from the parent claim it is refuting. Any subset of God proving arguments could be fallacious and just as long as there is one philosophical argument that is non fallacious then God would be proven. \(Perhaps the responses should be moved under their positive counterparts as cons and vice versa?\)
1.4.6.2.2. Con: This is an unsupported claim. It asserts that the arguments for God’s existence fail on the grounds that the evidence provided is not compelling, yet provides no epistomological definition of what constitutes acceptable evidence.
1.4.6.2.3. Pro: In what may well be an apocryphal story, the great atheist philosopher Bertrand Russell was once asked what he would say if he found himself standing before God on the judgement day and God asked him, "Why didn’t you believe in Me?" Russell replied, "I would say, ‘Not enough evidence, God!  Not enough evidence!'"
1.4.6.2.3.1. Con: Russell said this a long time ago. We have more evidence now that we should look at ourselves.
1.4.6.2.3.1.1. Pro: Evidence for universal fine-tuning \(as opposed to the fine-tuning of only the Earth's environment\) only began to be discovered in the 1960's, near the end of Russell's life, and has been steadily piling up ever since.
1.4.6.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.1.
1.4.6.2.3.1.2. Pro: Several ontological arguments, such as Plantinga's and Maydole's, weren't written until after Russell's death. Gödel's wasn't discovered and published until after his death either.
1.4.6.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.13.
1.4.6.2.3.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.5.
1.4.6.2.3.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.6.
1.4.6.2.3.2. Con: A single person lacking evidence, even if he were telling the truth, neither implies that evidence does not exist, nor does it imply that the thing in question does not exist.
1.4.6.2.4. Con: The argument here rests on the principle of non-contradiction. We are justified in believing that principle, even though we lack sufficient evidence for it. \(There are no good arguments for it, and what sensory evidence there may be for it is inadequate.\)
1.4.6.2.5. Con: Lack of evidence is immaterial to beliefs in general. Almost all claims which are ostensibly rejected for lack of evidence are actually rejected due to various elements of prior implausibility.  Russell's teapot is an ironic example. Believing in the teapot is not problematic because of insufficient evidence, but rather because a teapot in orbit is extremely improbable either to have originated naturally or to have originated artificially.
1.4.6.2.5.1. Con: It is epistemically wrong for anyone, anywhere to believe anything on insufficient evidence. \(Modified [Clifford's Dictum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_belief)\)
1.4.6.3. Con: Belief in something does not require 100% proof but sufficient evidence.
1.4.6.3.1. Pro: Epistemologically, the only undeniable statement is "I think, therefore I am". All other claims weighed by partial evidence, or by rules such as "justified true belief", rather than requiring that we "know for sure".
1.4.6.3.1.1. Con: Epistemologically "I think, therefore I am" is no more sound an argument than "I am the subject of a proposition, therefore I am". We could stop at "there is a thought" and that would be pretty much sound. But I don't see how that entails the existence of a thinking being. The word "I" is illegitimate since it does not describe a datum, though it is convenient in normal language.
1.4.6.3.2. Con: The example of the pancreas does not apply to God because the basic scientific model of the pancreas is well defined in scientific community and proved in accordance with scientific criteria, whereas neither the scientific community nor the religious communities have a formal and unified definition of God.
1.4.6.3.3. Con: Infering information based on proof of related phenomena is the cornerstone of all research and is a fantastic tool, however this does not have an analoguous point in the search for god. We have ancient writings of people who already believed in god/gods unquestionably, and offered us no proof other than parables, myths and stores of happenings that are both unverifyable and as believable as any piece of work written by those long since dead.
1.4.6.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.2.1.
1.4.6.3.3.2. Pro: There is no demonstrable scientific evidence that proves the existence of God.
1.4.6.3.3.2.1. Pro: Every claim of observable features of the world that point to the actions of gods or other mythical beings has been shown to be caused by natural means. While theists believe the origin of the natural world is a miracle, empirical facts point to natural explanations for the origins of life, Earth, and the universe without need to appeal to any mythological explanation. For those hoping to find empirical evidence for their faith, "God of the Gaps" is the only \(fundamentally flawed\) proposal left.
1.4.6.3.3.2.1.1. Con: The claim is too broad. The universe itself is an observable feature of the world; yet cannot be shown to be caused by natural means.
1.4.6.3.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: According to our best scientific data, time, space, matter, and energy \(the "universe", or "nature"\) came into existence. It is impossible for something that does not exist to act in any way, and therefore, "nature" cannot bring about its own existence.
1.4.6.3.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The system mentioned does not perfectly support itself \(even as a whole the universe is slowly coming to a halt\).
1.4.6.3.3.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.11.1.
1.4.6.3.3.2.1.2. Con: The presupposition here is that God can only be an explanation for physical and contingent things. This is simply not true, and trying to appeal to science is the ''crackers in the pantry'' fallacy. You don't prove God like you don't prove the law of logic with science. God's Mind is what links immaterial forces of logic and number to be coherent instead of dialectical insanity working against each other.
1.4.6.3.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.2.2.
1.4.6.3.3.2.3. Con: Science is incapable of proving or disproving the existence of God because it only tells us the method by which things occur and not the reason why they occur.
1.4.6.3.3.2.3.1. Con: Science suggests that how an event occurs is by way of thermodynamical processes, which is precisely the same as the reason why they occur i.e. because of thermodynamical processes
1.4.6.3.3.2.4. Pro: Science & research is the only tool which has ever reliably proven or disproven anything with consistent results and so should be adhered to
1.4.6.3.3.2.4.1. Con: The problem is in the term 'anything.' The scientific method has a limited domain. For example, developments in history like the Fall of Rome resist reductive scientific methods.
1.4.6.3.3.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.3.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5. Pro: The [Sagan Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagan_standard), "The weight of evidence for an extraordinary claim must be proportioned to its strangeness" often paraphrased as "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"; implies that there needs to be a lot of very convincing evidence for the existence of God, which is lacking.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.1. Con: That the Sagan Standard is valid is, itself, an extraordinary claim, yet it is accepted with no evidence whatsoever.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.1.1. Con: The Sagan Standard is an easily derived pattern from probabilities of claims being true given their similarity with events known to be true. Thus, the Sagan Standard is neither necessarily accepted without evidence nor is it extraordinary.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.2. Con: The "Sagan Standard" presupposes the uniformity of nature, which itself would be very extraordinary without a god, but which lacks any proof.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.2.1. Con: The uniformity of nature has been amply demonstrated.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.2.2. Con: The existence of a God plus the uniformity of nature is more unlikely than the sole existence of uniformity of nature.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.3. Con: If one is willing to accept miracles, then they would count as sufficiently extraordinary evidence.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.3.1. Con: Miracles are generally events unlike any other, taken as true based on evidence that does not at all satisfies the Sagan Standard.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.4. Con: No claim is intrinsically strange, though some claims seem strange to some people. If Sagan were right, then the amount of evidence needed for a claim would depend on whose perspective we were taking.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.4.1. Con: "Strange" there simply means how \[dis\]similar to claims that are actually the case a claim is. That does not depend on an individuals perspective.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5. Con: The Sagan Standard can also apply for the claim that any god doesn't exist; that is, it is unscientific to claim no god exists when there is no extraordinary evidence proving said god's nonexistence \(especially considering we have no way of observing or measuring that which exists "superior to" or outside of "creation" or the expanding universe\).  In as much, Agnosticism makes more scientific sense than Atheism.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.1. Con: [A priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori), the existence of God is improbable.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.1.1. Pro: Out of a myriad of possible scenarios contradictory with God's existence, God is just one possible case. That puts God at a lower than average a priori probability of being real.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.1.1.1. Con: This is a misapplication of statistical reasoning. With billions of persons in the world, it is highly unlikely that precisely this small subset of persons would collaborate on this discussion; yet here we are.

It is absurd to say that two plus two cannot equal four because the odds of the correct answer being four out of an infinite number of integers is \(literally\) infinity to one. Yet that is an exact analog to the argument presented here.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Something being the case does not mean that a priori \(ie. without specific information\) it is not highly unlikely.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: It is highly unlikely that I am in any specific galaxy in the universe, yet I am in the Milky Way - which is only likely given certain a posteriori information \[for instance information about me or about humans\].
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.1.1.1.2. Con: At least this discussion is likely to have people in it, since it is linked to a network that makes it likely \(ie social network\). The existence of God has no such reasons to be believed a priori.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.1.1.1.3. Con: Two plus two are known to equal 4 a priori, since they are part of a framework that follows logically from a priori conditions in Math. Taking any two random symbols representing quantities between -infinity and +infinity however makes it quite certain that the results will not equal four. And that is a lot more analog to the argument presented.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.1.2. Pro: The existence of God is asserted on basis that would be \(and often are\) unacceptable for other fictional characters.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.1.3. Pro: Most people who believe in God don't have sound justifications for their beliefs.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.1.4. Con: The argument of "improbability" is not a sound way of disproving the existence of God. Many things, even the development of human life through evolution, could be regarded as "improbable" and yet that does not serve as a refutation against the existence of human life.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.2. Pro: Applying the Sagan Standard to the atheistic assertion that the universe came into existence from a state of non-existence without an external agent \(which is also an extraordinary claim\), would seem to imply that such an agent should exist, or that the universe should not exist. As it is self-evident that the universe exists, it follows that the Sagan Standard supports a theistic position.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.3. Con: [Agnosticism](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/agnostic) is not exclusive from either theism or atheism. [Gnosticism](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/gnostic?s=t) deals with knowledge; [Theism](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/theism?s=t) deals with belief.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.1.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.7. Con: Even if the Sagan Standard were a legitimate criterion, it remains to be shown that there is anything strange or extraordinary about the claim that God exists.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.7.1. Con: The lack of examples of gods is proof that "God exists" it is an extraordinary claim.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.7.2. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.1.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.8. Con: The Sagan Standard is unsupported, as there is [no clear reason](https://calumsblog.com/2017/07/25/do-extraordinary-claims-require-extraordinary-evidence/) to expect the level of evidence for a claim to be proportionate to its oddity.
1.4.6.3.3.2.5.8.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.3.2.5.1.1.
1.4.6.3.3.2.6. Pro: Experiences that may prove the existence of God lack reproducibility.
1.4.6.3.3.2.6.1. Pro: Considering a God which answers to prayers. One may pray months and get nothing that \(s\)he awards to God, whereas one may never pray and award something to God. Then, this God's existence theory is not reliable.
1.4.6.3.3.2.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.2.
1.4.6.3.3.2.6.1.2. Con: The definition used in this debate does not require that God answer intercessory prayers.
1.4.6.3.3.2.7. Con: "Demonstrable evidence should not be appealed to in this case, because humans as 3rd dimensional beings are incapable of perceiving a higher dimensional being."
1.4.6.3.3.2.7.1. Pro: God's existence can be proven on a person-by-person basis through the practice of meditation, deep devotion, or the path of wisdom.  This is where the individual becomes a spiritual scientist using the laboratory his/her own consciousness to discover the consciousness of God within him/herself.  Since science depends on the testimony of the senses, it is too limited to discover God.
1.4.6.3.3.2.8. Pro: [Falsifiability](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/falsifiability) is required to prove that something is or is not true and cannot be achieved without a measurable focus. As god is not measurable you can not use scientific method to test the validity of god.
1.4.6.3.3.2.8.1. Con: To the extent that you can not use the scientific method to test the validity of God this is true. However this suggests that, as God is not a scientific theory, the scientific approach is wrong. It would be the same to try to scientifically demonstrate the existence of love or other abstract concepts.
1.4.6.3.3.2.8.1.1. Con: There is no problem to demonstrate existence of love scientifically. It exists as a social phenomenon and behaviour of people.
1.4.6.3.3.2.8.1.1.1. Con: This commits a category error. 

Behavior is observed, but is not love. Love may motivate behavior, but it cannot be directly observed.
1.4.6.3.3.2.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: Providing medical care can be an act of love. However, a prison doctor may provide medical care to the serial killer that murdered his family out of duty rather than love. The observed behavior is the same, but the motivating force is different.
1.4.6.3.3.2.8.1.1.1.2. Con: There is behaviour associated with love that is distinct from love as a source of motivation \( both exist\). The behaviour has been studied scientifically, e.g. in Kinsey reports.
1.4.6.3.3.2.8.1.2. Con: Abstract concepts can be and have been modelled scientifically for example in computer science. [Software Design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) [Abstraction in computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_\(computer_science\)) [Category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory)
1.4.6.3.3.2.8.1.2.1. Con: A software design pattern is an abstraction... until it is implemented. Then it is a concrete implementation of an abstract pattern.
1.4.6.3.3.2.8.2. Con: Falsifiability serves as a test for a scientific theory, but positive evidence can maintain a theory as scientific despite failing the falsifiability test. 

For example, Darwin said that the fossil record is incomplete and serves as the biggest objection to his theory. The fossil record still poses a problem for evolution, but in light of other positive evidence the theory continues to be accepted by the majority of scientists.
1.4.6.3.3.2.8.2.1. Con: Falsifiability or other scientific principles would not require completeness of the fossil record. It does require that when new measurements are made, the theories adapt to include the new evidence to the extent it's valid. Usually accepted theories are very resistant to new evidence \( they include it already \).
1.4.6.3.3.2.9. Pro: Given God is all-powerful then God must be part of nature, therefore God would be detectable using the same methods by which we detect other natural entities.
1.4.6.3.3.2.9.1. Con: God us understood to be the creator of nature. Just as an artist is not in his painting, nor a sculptor in her sculpture, nor the author of "The Sims" a part of the Sims universe, God is not a part of nature. The creator transcends and is in no way dependent on the creation, although he may interact with it from time to time.
1.4.6.3.3.2.9.2. Con: It does not follow that, if God is transcendent to nature, that such a God would be "limited".
1.4.6.3.3.2.10. Con: Human life - self aware, conscious and free willed - is evidence of consciousness being either a fundamental characteristic or an emergent property of the universe itself. Given that [scraps of DNA have been found even on asteroids](https://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/dna-building-blocks-can-be-made-space/), its likely that life is fairly common, though it does require [Goldilocks conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone) to manifest as human-level \(or higher\) forms. The fact that all of this happened naturally - on its own - is evidence that a theistic God could have set up the board.
1.4.6.3.3.2.11. Con: Absence of demonstrable scientific evidence would not show that an entity does not exist. The Higgs Boson existed before we knew of the existence of atoms.
1.4.6.3.3.2.11.1. Con: That doesn't apply to the case of God, people claimed the existence of god before any evidence.
1.4.6.3.3.2.11.2. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.1.
1.4.6.3.3.2.12. Con: Few things are actually "provable". While it may be true that scientific evidence cannot "prove" God's existence, many lines of scientific evidence for theism are presented in this very discussion. The question is not whether they prove God's existence conclusively, but whether the evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that God exists.
1.4.6.3.3.2.13. Con: -> See 1.2.2.7.
1.4.6.3.4. Con: Sufficient evidence is the same as 100% proof.
1.4.6.3.4.1. Con: Many persons have been thrown in prison by the standard of "sufficient evidence", only to be set free later when other evidence \(perhaps via DNA or video\) was found that offered "100% proof" of their innocence. The claim is demonstrably false.
1.4.6.4. Pro: There is no reasonable and consistent standard of evidence that allows for belief in the existence of a god.
To be consistent, a theist must believe in Bigfoot, faeries, and all other imaginable things. But this is not reasonable.
To be reasonable, a theist must not believe in Bigfoot, faeries, and all other imaginable things. But this is not consistent.
1.4.6.4.1. Con: There isn't a clear reason to put God in the same category as mythological or imaginary things, and [arguments based on such a categorization fail](https://calumsblog.com/2012/12/24/why-i-do-not-think-god-is-supernatural/).
1.4.6.4.2. Con: It is consistent to believe in the classical God based on the arguments and evidence set forth in this discussion, but reject mythological and imaginary entities such as fairies since they don't have similar arguments or evidence.
1.4.6.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.2.1.
1.4.6.5. Pro: There is also no firm basis upon which to judge that God doesn't exist either. The hypothesis that a God exists has to be treated as possible since there is no counter fact that proves this hypothesis wrong.
1.4.6.5.1. Con: An argument presented without proof can be dismissed without proof.
1.4.6.6. Con: The existence of agnosticism as a position on the topic of God's existence is not a counterpoint to the claim that philosophical evidences support the existence of God.  One could very well take a position as an agnostic while acknowledging some arguments and evidence for God exists, but still determining it is impossible to have justified belief or true knowledge of God's existence.
1.4.6.7. Pro: Like [Russell's Teapot](https://infogalactic.com/info/Russell%27s_teapot), claims about God's existence need to be proved before they are believed. The burden of proof lies with theists.
1.4.6.7.1. Pro: There is not enough scientific evidence to prove that leprechauns do not exist, nor that unicorns and the flying spaghetti monster do not exist.  If your standard for acceptance of a given belief is simply a lack of scientific disproof, then you must also believe in leprechauns, unicorns, the flying spaghetti monster, and any other ridiculous thing that I might want to suggest. This is why there is a burden of proof before things must be believed.
1.4.6.7.1.1. Con: Theists have accepted the burden of proof and provided evidence for the existence of God.
1.4.6.7.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.
1.4.6.7.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.4.6.7.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.4.6.7.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.
1.4.6.7.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.4.6.7.1.1.6. Con: The arguments used for God's existence could also be used to support the existence of the [Flying Spaghetti Monster.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster?wprov=sfla1)
1.4.6.7.1.1.6.1. Pro: These arguments about FSM were explicitly designed to be similar to arguments about God that are considered fallacious by supporters of FSM.
1.4.6.7.1.1.6.2. Pro: Any approach to argumentation that cannot distinguish God from FSM during the argument would be rejected because it is against the principle of freedom of religion of either the believers of God or of believers of FSM.
1.4.6.7.1.2. Con: Theists do not make positive claims to know of the non-existence of leprechauns or flying spaghetti monsters.
1.4.6.7.1.2.1. Con: Atheists do not make positive claims to know of the non-existence of god.
1.4.6.7.1.3. Con: Unlike creatures like monsters and leprechauns, the existence of God is a universal, or nearly universal belief, which transcends cultures and history. While this itself does not prove its truth, it provides a stark contrast to purely fantasy constructs.
1.4.6.7.1.3.1. Con: Fictional characters such as monsters and leprechauns are universal and transcend culture and history as well.  Though descriptions vary, nearly all cultures have monsters and various fantastic creatures in their folklore.  The idea of God does not stand in stark contrast to these other fictive constructs.
1.4.6.7.1.3.2. Con: There is no single universal notion of God. Instead there are multiple different and incompatible notions. This variation occurs because the concept of God contains pure fantasy elements.
1.4.6.7.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.1.
1.4.6.7.2. Con: We believe and investigate some claims without proof. There is no scientific proof or evidence that alien life exists and yet there are no objections to the continued search for it. The search for and belief in God are no different.
1.4.6.7.2.1. Con: That the search for extraterrestrial life is based solely on a belief is clearly stated, and never confused for the statement that this life exists.
1.4.6.7.2.2. Con: The existence of alien life is an empirical probability, based on the number of planets close enough to their sun to form a habitable atmosphere. God has no such basis.
1.4.6.7.2.3. Pro: There are no objections to the continued scientific search for God either, so long as this research is scientifically formulated ─ which at its most fundamental level means that it is argumented in terms that can be falsified.
1.4.6.7.3. Con: -> See 1.4.6.7.1.1.
1.4.6.7.4. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.
1.4.6.8. Pro: An all knowing, all seeing god would speak \(or act\) to make his presence known. Indeed, most early writings of major religions support this notion that god makes his will clearly known by communicating to humans. Yet, no such communication exists today.
1.4.6.8.1. Con: The followers of Jesus and Jesus himself claimed that God had made himself known through both the prophetic writings and the person of Jesus - that he himself is the communication of the presence and will of God. Those writings are available today, and claim to be a communication from God to humans.
1.4.6.8.2. Con: The presumption that an all knowing and all seeing God would speak or act to make its presence known is logically unfounded. An artist, for example, does not maintain eternal vigil alongside the works they have created.
1.4.6.8.2.1. Con: If we presume that certain sacred documents are divinely inspired, dictated, or authored, then it seems to follow that God has at least some interest in communicating with humanity, thereby making its presence known.
1.4.6.8.2.1.1. Con: God may have had interest in communicating with humanity historically, but may believe that past communication was sufficient enough and is not necessarily tied to an eternity of such communication.
1.4.6.8.2.1.2. Con: The interest in communicating with humanity may not stem from a desire to make its presence known - correlation is not causation. The existence of such documents merely indicates a supernatural presence. For an idea of its interests, one has to gather more information, say from the documents themselves.
1.4.6.8.3. Con: Mormons believe that God continues to communicate with humans today through living prophets today as he did in ancient times as recorded in the Bible and the Book of Mormon. [\(see Prophets\)](https://www.lds.org/topics/prophets?lang=eng)
1.4.6.8.4. Con: The Bible is said to be God's communication to men. In the Bible it states why man is left alone without communication for the time.
1.4.6.8.4.1. Con: Historical records \(including some present within the Bible\) suggest it was written and compiled for political purposes. Particularly gaining support for: the attempted annexation of Judah to Israel \(~8th century BCE\), the Maccabean Revolt \(167 BCE - 160 BCE\) and the First Jewish-Roman War \(66 CE - 70 CE\).
1.4.6.8.4.2. Con: Nothing within the Bible suggest it was truly inspired by a higher power.
1.4.6.8.4.2.1. Con: Being unable to see that something is inspired by a higher power is not evidence that it wasn't inspired by a higher power.
1.4.6.8.5. Pro: The way to check for God would be prayer studies. Results showed prayer does not work.[STEP study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16569567)
1.4.6.8.5.1. Con: Biblically prayer is an act of faith, and must be undertaken with a believing heart.  A prayer study is by nature and act of skepticism or doubt, and therefore by nature is faithless.  Therefore, the nature of the study is self defeating; as a person of faith does not require a prayer study.
1.4.6.8.6. Con: There is no current intellectual consensus on what would constitute proof positive of such communication, which might be a reason why there appears to be no communication at all - if the folder doesn't exist, there can't possibly be any documents in it.
1.4.6.8.7. Con: At a personal level, many believe the Vedas to be divinely inspired, if not dictated. Similarly for the Bible and the Quran.
1.4.6.8.7.1. Pro: In traditional Hinduism, even the Mahabharata is considered a true tale of direct divine intervention in human affairs. As for whether it truly is an example of divine communication - the story has been studied and commented on by several generations of Indian writers, and has been found to contain deep lessons in philosophy, statecraft, human morality and psychology. In many ways, it is a textbook for human psychological development. \(It's also a damn good story, but I may be biased.\)
1.4.7. Con: Atheism holds that the absence of evidence for God's existence is good evidence that God does not exist.
1.4.7.1. Pro: Whether there are good reasons or not to believe in something does not affect its existence. By this logic, if God did not exist, and I had a reason to believe God existed, God would suddenly exist.
1.4.7.1.1. Con: Personal reasoning is not the same as evidence. While there might be a reason/belief behind believing that a God does not exist, there is evidence/fact to prove that there is a God who exists.
1.4.7.1.2. Pro: The same logic also holds for the contrary. Even if everybody were to believe that God does not exist, it would not affect God's existence.
1.4.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.2.
1.4.7.3. Pro: Source [physicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism) is many times more probable than omni-theism.
1.4.7.3.1. Pro: [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor) suggests physicalism should be the preferred explanation over the existence of God.
1.4.7.3.1.1. Con: Occam's Razor only holds in the case of equally strong competing explanations. There are good explanations of the existence of God, which, if they are stronger than the explanations of his non-existence, invalidate Occam's Razor.
1.4.7.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.2.1.
1.4.7.3.1.1.2. Con: Occams razor works everywhere we're trying to explain observations.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3. Con: Occam's razor only applies to testable ideas. Since there are no tests available for or against a god's existence, Occam's razor does not apply to god claims.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.1. Con: Occam's Razor has nothing to do with testability whatever, and is in fact most decisive where we do not have recourse to empirical tests.

For example, the hypothesis that "toys come to life when they are not being observed, but then return everything to exactly the position that it would have been once humans can directly or indirectly perceive them" is not testable, but we reject it because the rival \(but empirically indistinguishable\) explanation is simpler.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2. Con: Occam's Razor can apply to an untestable hypothesis. It is based on the principle that a simple hypothesis is more testable and therefore more useful than a complex hypothesis. If a hypothesis is so complex as to be unfalsifiable, the Razor says that it should be discarded.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Applying Occam's Razor to claims in favor of a god's existence means that those claims should be discarded since they are not falsifiable.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.3. Con: The classical theistic definition of a god is testable. Therefore, Occam's razor can be used.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.
1.4.7.3.1.2. Con: Occam's Razor is just a useful heuristic and should never be used as the final arbiter to decide which theory is to be favored.
1.4.7.3.1.2.1. Con: It's purpose is as a means of deciding which of available solutions should be favored.
1.4.7.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.1.3.
1.4.7.3.1.4. Pro: Materialism, and the study of matter, has produced consistent understandings of physics, biology, mathematics and technology all over the world. In contrast, belief in god, as well as beliefs about his intentions and values, vary from person to person and between the [hundreds](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religions) of religious sects worldwide.

It follows that physicalism, as a heuristic, yields a more objective, robust and useful explanation of and approach to the universe and our place within it.
1.4.7.3.1.4.1. Con: Scientific progress doesn't rely on physicalism in the sense of rejecting all non-material claims, only the belief that the material world follows knowable rules. Belief in or rejection of God has no relation to that.
1.4.7.3.1.5. Pro: Bertrand Russell's [teapot analogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot) asks if one imagines a teapot was in orbit around the sun, would we consider the fact that it's very small, or perhaps that the sun blocks it from view, be reasons to believe such a teapot exists? 

Russell was employing Occam's heuristic within this analogy by asking is a thing which cannot be observed, measured or seen to have any [consistent or reliable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Moves_in_a_Mysterious_Way) effect on our lives, worth believing in for any reason other than mere self-[consolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolation)?"
1.4.7.3.1.6. Pro: Throughout history god has been cited as the cause for mental illness, the weather, viral and bacterial infection, volcanic eruptions, it was only because certain people preferred physical, measurable explanations of these phenomena that the human race now has facilities for psychology, forecasting weather and natural disasters as well as modern medicine.
1.4.7.3.1.6.1. Con: Citing unexplained naturalist phenomenon is no more reliable of an explanation for unknown causes than that of direct intervention.
1.4.7.3.1.7. Pro: In the absence of scientific explanations for natural phenomena, sentient beings are very likely to come up with the idea of god to explain why natural phenomena occur. The concept gains credence due to the power that comes with it. One individual can use the concept of god\(s\) to exert influence over the other \(e.g. "do this or the gods will be angry"\). This has been repeated across the world with the creation of many different gods.
1.4.7.3.1.7.1. Con: The fact that different unrelated cultures have developed ideas of God, divinity or transcendence is an argument for a diferent origin to those ideas other than cultural heritage.
1.4.7.3.1.7.2. Con: Modern theological arguments \(teleological, moral, ontological, cosmological\) arrive at the existence of a God deductively, by revealing a situation that could only be properly explained by something we'd call a God, not by seeing unanswered questions and proposing a God to explain them.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3. Con: A tendency for creatures to believe in God is exactly what we'd expect if God created humans to believe in Him.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1. Con: Atheists exist which is not what we would expect if a god existed
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1. Pro: An omniscient being who wants to be noticed should be impossible to miss, so to even merely lack belief rather than disbelieve should require ample evidence that such a God exists. 

To actually maintain a positive belief in God should require even more substantial evidence than would be required merely to be agnostic.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.1. Con: Classical theism says nothing about divine desire for being noticed, so divine hiddenness is not an argument against the classical theism.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.2. Pro: If God does exist, then he is a terrible communicator. This would seem to undermine the theistic notion that he cares about people and wants them to be able to know, love, follow, and worship him.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.2.1. Con: A God that issues specific instructions to every last human is not producing life in its own image - it would be producing slaves. To acheive God's own image requires that humans also have free will. The proper exercise of any ability - including free will - requires a period of 'training wheels off' practice. In this context, that means a God that privileges free will over obedience to divine command. Even if that produces 'errors' like evil.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: False dichotomy, there's a lot of space between God personally telling everyone exactly what to do, and the lack of evidence we have in reality.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.2.2. Con: Consider the difficulty of an immortal being passing along teachings to very short lived creatures. Hands on, constant instructions would require almost infinite repetition and eternal presence - God would pretty much have to devote an inordinate amount of time \(a limited resource in this universe if God obeys its own laws\) to each generation of humans. Also, if you're training someone to think, then puzzles and quests are far more efficient than explicit instructions.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.2.2.1. Con: "If God obeys \[his universe\]'s own laws" is a big assumption to make of a character defined by his omnipotence.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.2.3. Con: Where the 'burden of understanding' lies - with the speaker of with the listener - is also a relevant aspect. In kindergarten, the burden is on the speaker - the teacher must simplify everything to the target audience's limits. As ability grows - say college onward - the burden of understanding shifts to the student.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.2.3.1. Con: Between a puny mortal human and an allegedly infinite God, the relationship would seem to much more closely resemble that between a kindergarten teacher and their students than a college professor.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.2.3.2. Con: Kindergarten teachers and college professors share the important quality of not being invisible to their students. At no point in education is "does the teacher exist?" a question the educational body has any reason to make its students ask.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.2.4. Con: Empirical evidence would suggest a contrary conclusion to the claim that "God is a terrible communicator."

Christianity is the most recognized brand in the world. The biblical text and church are enduring religious phenomenon that has reached millions of lives throughout their lifespan.

If the God of Christianity is the theistic God we are addressing, then He has done a wonderful job of communicating to a large number of people throughout the ages.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.2.4.1. Con: Creating an impressive organisation by human standards is a terribly low bar for someone who's supposed to be infinitely great
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.2.4.2. Con: How large Christianity is relative to Islam and Hinduism, or rather how large it isn't - the latter combined have more believers than the former - does not make sense if the God of Christianity is real and doing any job at all, even a terrible one, of communicating to humanity.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.3. Pro: The fact that people have to tell you about the existence of a god, is pretty good evidence that they do not exist.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.4. Con: God is impossible to miss except when people are blinded by certain socially constructed habits of thinking which are hostile to Them.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.4.1. Con: One can just as easily assert that God's non-existence is obvious except to people blinded by certain socially constructed habits of thinking.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.5. Con: This argument falsely equivocates an omniscient being wanting to be known and said omniscient being providing irrefutable, scientific/empirical evidence of Their existence.

If an omniscient being wanted to be noticed, from the dawn of humanity until now, They would have to appeal to some other form of human understanding than scientific reasoning, which has only existed for a little over 400 years.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.5.1. Con: It seems just as valid to assert either that:
A\) An omniscient being should wish to be noticed and so should prefer clear, reliable communication
B\) An omniscient should not wish to be noticed and so might prefer vague, unreliable communication.

But since theists also claim that God has an interest in the wellbeing of humanity. If God did exist, and still did prefer option B, then it seems unlikely that God really does have an interest in the wellbeing of humanity.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Whether or not God is interested in the wellbeing of humanity does not support or refute His existence.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.5.2. Con: The scientific method has only existed for a few centuries, but this is just the codified form of "believing things based on evidence", which is as old as the ability to learn and predates humanity by millions of years.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.6. Con: God does not reveal himself in order to give people the free choice of faith. In other words, God is running a simulation to distinguish those who believe from those who don't.
1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.2. Con: A free will allowing God would allow atheism to exist.
1.4.7.3.1.7.4. Con: A different order of events is even more likely. Sentient beings, having the idea of supernatural being, assign natural phenomena they cannot explain to that being. So God is at least equally or even less likely the consequence of ignorance about nature, He is rather a cause of supernatural explanation of the puzzling phenomena. Why would anybody invent God to justify ignorance? Any ignorance should remain just a simple ignorance, no need for God.
1.4.7.3.1.7.4.1. Con: It is reasonable to believe that people invented God to answer many questions about our universe. People don't like unanswered questions.
1.4.7.3.1.7.4.2. Con: In order to survive, we have evolved the ability to conjecture a cause to a phenomenon, even with incomplete data, as evidenced by our ability to come up with answers at all, but sometimes, this system gets it wrong.
1.4.7.3.1.7.4.2.1. Con: Not related. I never argued against assigning a cause to a phenomena. My claim is about the rank: 1. unexplained phenomena causing the idea of God or 2. already having the idea of God, then assigning unexplained phenomena to Him. We are well aware of ignorance, no need to assign a particular ignorance to God. "I don't know who took my wallet - wow! - it must have been God!" Second option is thus more probable.
1.4.7.3.1.7.4.2.1.1. Con: Although humans like answers, this does not blind them to questions, we are naturally curious, and defiant, and will generally only fall back on an easy answer if we can't find a better alternative.
1.4.7.3.1.7.4.2.1.2. Con: There is a stark difference between questions relevant to everyday survival, and function, and questions we want answered, but aren't easily applicable to our life.
1.4.7.3.1.7.5. Pro: The fact that you can track the evolution of religion to what we currently have suggests that it is a human construct and that no such power/presence exists.
1.4.7.3.1.7.5.1. Con: The fact that religion by definition is a human construct does not disprove God in the philosophical sense.
1.4.7.3.1.7.5.1.1. Con: The classical god supposes that god would want humans to know about its existence, so there should be one accurate religion not many contradictory religions
1.4.7.3.1.7.5.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.4.
1.4.7.3.1.7.5.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.
1.4.7.3.1.7.5.2. Con: The idea of the divine permeating culture is evidence of a common origin from a divine creator rather than invention.
1.4.7.3.1.8. Con: Occam's Razor supports other forms of monism, such as nondualism, idealism, panpsychism or computationalism just as well as it supports physicalism, because conscious experience is the only thing that we know for certain exists. Physicalism requires the assumption of new entities which are being perceived yet still 'exist' outside of perception.
1.4.7.3.1.9. Con: Occam's razor prefers the simpler theorem. It a simple explanation that an infinite omnipotent created the universe. A far more complicated theorem is required in order to explain how the universe \(and physics itself\) could come into existence in the absense of God.
1.4.7.3.1.9.1. Con: The theory of God's existence requires you to make a number of assumptions:
1. assume God exists
2. assume him to be powerful enough to create the universe
3. assume that he wants to do so
1.4.7.3.1.9.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.10.2.
1.4.7.3.1.9.1.2. Con: Any theory of the origin of the universe will require the pre-existence of at least something. Even naturalistic explanations such as the big bang start with presupposing some laws of physics.
1.4.7.3.1.9.1.2.1. Con: Laws of physics are testable and demonstrably true. God's existence is not \(or has not been\).
1.4.7.3.1.9.1.2.2. Con: It is true of both naturalistic explanations and the God explanation, that any theory of the origin of the universe will require pre-existence of at least some thing.
1.4.7.3.1.9.2. Con: God creating the universe is less simple according to Occam's Razor. To explain the universe from a non-theistic point of view requires one less thing to explain.
1.4.7.3.1.9.2.1. Con: Removing God from creation does not remove one fewer explanation, but removes the most simple explanation, thus contrasting Occam's Razor.
1.4.7.3.1.9.2.1.1. Con: As long as there is no extensive understanding on how a god would need to be in order to be able to create, god can not be classified as a simple explanation.
1.4.7.3.1.9.2.2. Con: The application of Occam's Razor prefers fewer variables. In theism, the only variable behind the universe is the will of God. Without theism, there can be many variables and brute principles which lie behind the operation of the laws of physics and the origin of the universe.
1.4.7.3.1.9.2.2.1. Con: All of the variables that exist without theism also exist with theism. Theism only adds another variable.
1.4.7.3.1.9.2.2.1.1. Con: Theism unifies diverse things under one single variable, the will of God. This is simpler than having a large number of "brute fact" variables without a unifying source or explanation.
1.4.7.3.2. Con: There is no contradiction between God's existence and the created order operating along physicalist lines, and most evidence we have for physicalism \(above all, its success in guiding scientific hypotheses\) concerns its being true of the world in which we are in. Therefore, most evidence for physicalism is not evidence against theism, even if theism is incompatible with more strict versions of physicalism.
1.4.7.3.3. Con: Physicalism is supported only by Occam's Razor, whereas theism is made even more probable by other factors.
1.4.7.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.2.1.
1.4.7.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.6.
1.4.7.3.5. Con: Probabilities and evidence are largely irrelevant to the question of God's existence. If you agree that the world exists, and that change occurs, then that is all the evidence that [Aquinas' First Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ways_\(Aquinas\)) requires to logically demonstrate God's existence.
1.4.7.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.
1.4.7.3.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.
1.4.7.3.5.3. Con: If probabilities and evidence are largely irrelevant to the question of God's existence, that means there is no debate. But such debates exist.
1.4.7.3.5.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.2.3.1.
1.4.7.3.6. Con: There is no known way to calculate the probability of any metaphysical statement. Therefore, probability can't be effectively used for metaphysical study, and other forms of reasoning \(like logical deduction\) are required.
1.4.7.3.6.1. Con: Because of uncertainty in our own reasoning abilities, we can be in a position of regarding in principle a priori positions as more or less likely.

For instance, prior to its more rigorous proof, most mathematicians regarded Fermat's Last Theorem as much more likely to be true than not.
1.4.7.3.6.2. Con: Metaphysics places itself outside measurement and examination. Thus it is unfalsifiable, by definition a fallacy, therefore unworthy of reasonable consideration when hypothesising real explanations for anything.
1.4.7.4. Pro: That which is presented without proof may be dismissed without proof.
1.4.7.4.1. Con: Theism rests on existing, mystifying phenomena such as the fact that humans exist at all. Or that our universe is apparently capable of evolving self aware, free willed creatures out of a lake of hydrogen and energy, and also capable of exploding out of a knot in space time *by itself*. The question might have more to do with what atheists will accept as proof rather than what proof actually exists.
1.4.7.4.2. Con: Atheism is presented without proof and thus could be dismissed for the same reason.
1.4.7.4.3. Con: To present a philosophical concept, proof is not required. Try proving randomness, for instance.
1.4.7.5. Con: We accept the vast majority of meaningful human knowledge without scientific evidence, particularly in the case of social knowledge. This truth criterion would eradicate almost all perfectly useful knowledge.
1.4.7.5.1. Pro: For example, there is no "evidence" that a particular couple are married \(instead, we accept the authority of particular individuals and organisations to come to that conclusion, as people do with God\), but it would be a strange thing to deny that a particular couple were married simply on those grounds; it is, instead, what Emile Durkheim referred to as a "social fact" \(we accept it on the grounds of social convention\).
1.4.7.5.1.1. Con: The existence of God is not a social fact like marriage, it is a fundamental fact about the origins of the universe. As such, it does not depend on social convention.
1.4.7.5.2. Pro: Similarly, I accept the fact that a particular ship is called the QEII because of similar social conventions associated with the naming authority of the person that launched her \(in this case, Queen Elizabeth II\), an aspect of philosophical truth claims based on Austin and Searle's notion of "natural language philosophy".
1.4.7.5.3. Pro: We accept the notion that the physical human body in front of us is a person, not on the grounds of objective evidence from physics, chemistry or biology, but rather on the grounds of what Daniel Dennett calls the "[intentional stance](http://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/a-grand-unified-theory-of-man/414269.article)" in human perception; no actual evidence, but socially necessary. \(see the linked article on this debate with precise reference to theological claims\).
1.4.7.5.4. Con: The parent claim does not specify scientific evidence, so this criticism does not apply.
1.4.7.6. Con: Our knowledge of the existence of something cannot be justified by our senses alone.
1.4.7.6.1. Con: It can be justified by senses and the processing that goes on in the brain.
1.4.7.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.7.3.1.1.
1.4.7.8. Con: Atheism/ atheists do not have a uniformly agreed upon standard of proof for what constitutes evidence for God's existence. That lack of a standard is why there appears to be a lack of evidence, not for an actual lack of data.
1.4.7.8.1. Pro: It is impossible to prove or disprove a thing that has not been described, and Atheism has no description of the God that it claims does not exist.
1.4.7.8.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.7.5.
1.4.7.9. Con: The definition of the theistic deity - the absolutely metaphysically ultimate being - actually implies that everything in existence is proof of God, because at some level, as the universal being, God *is* everything. This may appear a meaningless technicality, but it has profound consequences when it comes to explaining phenomena like the existence of human life.
1.4.7.9.1. Con: The unproven assumption that a God exists is the only thing supporting the claim that "everything" is evidence of God. \(It can be reformulated as: if God exists God is "everything", if God does not exist then God is not "everything".\) This is a circular argument.
1.4.7.10. Con: Atheism makes no claims, only denies the presence of evidence for a god. People who claim there is evidence a god does not exist aren't atheists but believers.
1.4.7.10.1. Con: People who believe that a God does not exist, do not believe that a God exists. Therefore they are atheist \(gnostic atheists, as oposed to agnostic atheists\).
1.4.7.10.2. Con: Agnostic atheists make no claims, while gnostic atheists make the claim that god does not exist.
1.4.7.10.3. Con: A denial is a claim. This is a flawed/illogical argument.
1.4.7.11. Con: Atheism is traditionally the absence in belief in deity.  If atheists, instead, accept a belief with no proof \(even in the non-existence of deity\), then they have essentially become a religion which cannot prove their own claims.
1.4.7.11.1. Con: A religion is more than a simple assertion on a single topic \([dictionary](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/religion)\). Belief in God is not a religion. Belief in the non-existence of God is similarly not a religion.
1.4.7.11.2. Con: The assumption that gnostic atheists can't adequately substantiate their position is unwarranted.
1.4.7.11.2.1. Pro: Many gnostic atheists claim that conceptions of God are incoherent \(either with themselves or with each other\).
1.4.7.11.3. Con: Atheism encompasses all people who do not believe that a deity exists. That includes gnosticism and agnosticism.
1.4.7.12. Con: -> See 1.4.6.2.1.
1.4.7.13. Con: Absence of evidence is not [evidence of absence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence).
1.4.7.13.1. Con: Absence of evidence when evidence is expected is [evidence of absence](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Absence_of_evidence).
1.4.7.13.1.1. Pro: If your neighbor never buys dog food, never walks a dog, and you never hear any barking, that's evidence they don't have a dog.
1.4.7.13.1.1.1. Con: There could always possibly be information that one isn't aware of, or that isn't obvious.  For example, it is possible that \(heaven forbid\) the owner locks the dog in their basement, never to be seen by the world.
1.4.7.13.1.1.1.1. Con: Absence of evidence is not proof of absence, and the parent didn't claim it was. Of course you can think of situations where evidence is absent yet the neighbor still owns a dog.
1.4.7.13.1.2. Con: The claim assumes that we have sufficient knowledge to know when evidence is expected. A neighbor that never buys dog food, never walks a dog, and from whose house you never hear barking may in fact own a dog... that still lives at their parent's house on the other side of town.
1.4.7.13.1.2.1. Con: Evidence is expected exactly when it is expected \(from your perspective, when you expect it\). The claim assumes you have sufficient knowledge to know whether you expect evidence or not.
1.4.7.13.1.2.1.1. Pro: The parent of the above claim conflates "evidence is expected" with "evidence should be expected"
1.4.7.13.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.7.13.1.1.1.1.
1.4.7.13.1.3. Pro: [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiNiW4_6R3I)
Let X be any proposition, and E the proposition 'There is evidence in the world that X is true'. 
3 assumptions:
1\)"evidence is expected": given X is true, it is more likely that E is true than false: P\(E|X\) \> P\(not E|X\). Therefore P\(not E|X\) \< 1/2
2\)"evidence is absent": P\(not E\) ≈ 1
3\)It is possible that X is false: P\(X\) \< 1
Proof:
1\)Bayes' theorem: P\(not E|X\) = P\(X|not E\)*P\(not E\)/P\(X\)
2\)Using the assumptions and algebra: P\(X|not E\) \< 1/2
3\)P\(X|not E\) \< P\(not X| not E\) Q.E.D.
1.4.7.14. Con: There is evidence all around in the form of unlikely things.
1.4.8. Pro: Arguments derived from game theory and utilitarianism support belief in the existence of God.
1.4.8.1. Pro: Consider the following: the benefit of belief in the existence of God if correct is eternal reward in the afterlife; if incorrect, there is no negative consequence. There is no benefit of disbelief in the existence of God and being correct; the consequence of disbelief and being incorrect is eternal punishment in the afterlife. Thus there is much to gain and nothing to lose by belief in God's existence.
1.4.8.1.1. Con: That is the Pascal's Wager, a fallacious argument \([inauthentic belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager#Argument_from_inauthentic_belief), [certain failure in the landscape of possible gods](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager#Infinite_number_of_gods)\).
1.4.8.1.2. Con: Consider also the contrary claim that the belief in God is punished by eternal damnation. There is no benefit to believing in God and there is infinite consequence to the belief in God. There is nothing to since unsubstantiated claims are counteracted by their opposite. In believing only in what is true at least at least the benefit of knowing the truth is gained \(which I assume is in the interest of a reasonable person\).
1.4.8.1.3. Con: There is much to lose to religion.
1.4.8.1.3.1. Pro: Time is lost praying and attending sermons.
1.4.8.1.3.2. Pro: Money is donated.
1.4.8.1.3.3. Pro: Control of your own morals is given to the religion.
1.4.8.1.3.4. Pro: Independence—Your views become secondary to that of the religion.
1.4.8.1.3.5. Pro: Joining a religion requires granting it a significant amount of social power
1.4.8.1.3.5.1. Pro: The nature of power granted varies arbitrarily from religion to religion, but can include control over your guilt, your reproductive process, what you wear, or who you are allowed to love.
1.4.8.1.4. Con: Utilitarian claims, either positive or negative, are not evidence.
1.4.8.2. Con: Belief in something does not justify the claim that the thing in question actually exists.
1.4.8.2.1. Con: Yet, the existence of beliefs like Karma, do have a positive impact on behalf of civilization by "taming" rough aspects of mankind. To some extent the positive outcome of such beliefs make them true by self-justification and have verifiable effects.
1.4.8.2.1.1. Con: This reasoning only works if belief in X=existence of X. This can work with Karma and \(the value of\) money. But not with other things like God.
1.4.8.3. Con: Utilitarianism, while being productive for morals, often leads to factually false conclusions when applied to truth \(due to a duality between what should be and what is\).
1.4.9. Con: Philosophical arguments for God all originated at a time and from people who were not capable of providing sound arguments for their beliefs. This is because social pressure gave people no option to consider other viewpoints
1.4.9.1. Con: Correct arguments remain correct whoever makes them.
1.4.9.2. Con: There always was an option to believe in God or not to believe in God. Atheism is not a new concept.
1.4.9.3. Con: Many instances of a person defending something they believe in, in an argument, should be an indication/testimony of evidence for how reasonable the belief is.
1.4.9.4. Con: To reject a claim solely because it comes from someone who believes in it is foolish. One would never suggest that we reject the theory of relativity because Einstein believed in it!
1.4.9.5. Pro: It's understandable that if something happens \(like a thunderstorm or rainbow\) and one does not understand why it happens due to lack of scientific knowledge, the person figures it "must" have been done by a god to punish, to help or give a sign they hoped for.
1.4.9.6. Con: Social pressure is now moving the other way, and atheism is becoming the more politically-correct view. This does not provide any evidence supporting or refuting atheism. In the same way, the origin of any argument for God's existence does not provide evidence supporting or refuting theism. This is a classic [genetic fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy).
1.4.9.7. Con: Philosophical arguments for the existence of God where made by people like Aristotle, Plato, Leibniz, and Einstein. The great intellect of these people and their contributions are without question. They were definitely capable of providing sound arguments for their beliefs.
1.4.10. Con: According to the nihilist viewpoint, God does not exist.
1.4.10.1. Con: God can be subjective and still exist.
1.4.10.1.1. Pro: Many argue that numbers and even "random" ideas have real existence \(platonism\).
1.4.10.1.1.1. Con: [Platonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism) is not subjective. Platonists hold that abstract objects exist in a "third realm", not that they exist as subjective ideas. [Subjectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivism) as a philosophy holds that no external truths exist.
1.4.10.1.2. Con: If God is subjective, then being "God" is not a property of the object, but intrinsically an ideal ascribed within the view of someone looking at the object from a certain prism.
1.4.10.1.3. Con: The God of classical Theism is the uncreated creator of all created things. A god that is subjective is, by definition, a created thing. Thus the two definitions are completely incompatible.
1.4.10.1.3.1. Con: That "creator God" does not exist, as creating requires time and there was no time before the big bang.
1.4.10.1.3.2. Con: That "creator God" does not exist if the [B theory of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-theory_of_time) is true.
1.4.10.1.3.2.1. Con: The B theory of time does not eliminate the need for a creator, who could have created and determined the entire course of history.
1.4.10.1.3.2.1.1. Con: If the universe always existed \(as per the b-theory of time\) then it was not created.
1.4.10.1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.4.10.1.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.4.10.1.3.3. Con: It is compatible with the definition of God being "ultimate metaphysical being".
1.4.10.2. Pro: If all things are metaphysically equal, there is no metaphysical ultimate or supreme.
1.4.10.2.1. Con: Assuming that all things are metaphysically equal assumes naturalism, so this claim begs the question.
1.4.10.3. Pro: The idea of a ultimate metaphysical being \(and therefore it's mapping onto any thing\) is subjective. God's existence is therefore purely subjective.
1.4.10.3.1. Pro: Conceptions of ultimate beings can, and often do, differ between people and cultures. Examples: extremely simple or extremely complex; incapable of thought or endowed with extreme forethought; beyond the universe or the universe; perfectly good or simply uninterested or even severe and totalitarian.
1.4.10.3.1.1. Con: Inconsistent concepts of God may show that some \(or all\) aspects of a given concept is incorrect. It does not show that no concrete object exists behind the concepts.
1.4.10.3.2. Con: That persons subjectively perceive a thing, even in different forms, does not entail that the thing is *merely* subjective.
1.4.10.4. Con: From a nihilistic viewpoint, every argument is ultimately meaningless including arguments for nonexistence.
1.4.10.5. Con: Nihilism, just as religion, is a viewpoint and does not provide any proof to the existence, or non-existence of God.
1.4.10.5.1. Con: For something to be considered divine the attribution of meaning is necessary, which disproves the fundamental existence of divinity.
1.4.10.5.1.1. Con: If God exists necessarily \(which implies immutability\) and eternally, then meaning has also existed necessarily and eternally in the mind of God, which provide divinity with its fundamental existence.
1.4.11. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.3.2.5.5.1.
1.4.12. Pro: Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics \(so called "Multiverse" idea\) implies that there are an infinite number of universes. Therefore there must be a universe where God exists.

[General description of the "many worlds interpretation"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2016/01/05/what-the-many-worlds-interpretation-of-quantum-physics-really-means/#27173be01102)
1.4.12.1. Con: If God were immanent and transcendent, he would exist in all of them simultaneously.
1.4.12.2. Con: The existence of an infinite number of universes doesn't imply that anything you can think of has to exist in one of the universes. For example, you can have an infinite number of universes where each of the universes is identical, except for the position of a single particle. Such an infinite set of universes would not have a universe with God in it.
1.4.12.2.1. Con: The multiverse above with a single particle moved is a very large, finite set of universes, not an infinite set.
1.4.12.2.1.1. Con: It would indeed be an infinite set. There is [an infinity of available places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space) for the particle to be at.
1.4.12.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.
1.4.12.2.3. Con: The existence of infinte universes just moves the problem from one universe to many without providing an actual solution to the dilemma
1.4.12.3. Con: An infinite number of universes is not a consistently rational idea and thus not possible. There may be multiple, but not infinite universes. If there were infinite universes there would also be a universe where there are not, there would be a universe that consumes all other universes and already has done so. The existence of multiple universes ensures that there are not multiple universes and therefore impossible.
1.4.12.4. Pro: As there is an infinitude of universes, there may be an infinitude of Gods, or, Creators of these infinitude of universes.
1.4.12.4.1. Pro: There could be a hierarchy of them with a Higher Intelligence created by an even Higher Intelligence who is in turn created by a still Higher Intelligence & so on & on ad infinitum.
1.4.12.5. Con: The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics describes universes branching off by natural, material, causal events, into two universes with the same history but a different future. A supernatural and eternal God cannot be created by such events.
1.4.13. Con: Humans may have evolved with a tendency of seeking a God to fulfill human psychological needs. Because of this, humans may be biased towards finding arguments supporting this view. See:[yourbias.is](https://www.yourbias.is/just-world-hypothesis)
1.4.13.1. Con: This claim does not detract from the force of the parent argument. Philosophical arguments for God are successful regardless whether or not persons may have natural tendencies to reject or accept them.
1.4.13.2. Con: The fact that Humans have evolved with a tendency to believe in God is better evidence that God exists than that he does not.
1.4.13.2.1. Con: By this argument, superheroes should exist as well.
1.4.13.2.2. Con: To associate the tendency that people have to believe in divine entities to their existence is doubtful. Historically people tended to believe in gods that today are mythological, like the Greek civilization towards the Greek gods.
1.4.13.3. Con: This claim commits the genetic fallacy - the attempt to invalidate a position by showing how a person came to hold it.
1.4.14. Pro: Hinduism supports the existence of God.
1.4.14.1. Con: Because Hinduism is a pantheistic or panentheistic belief system, this is not possible.
1.4.14.1.1. Pro: God in this discussion is defined to be the God of classical theism, which is a monotheistic God. If Hinduism "proves" the existence of this God, then it would also prove itself to be false... in which case, it could prove nothing.
1.4.14.1.2. Pro: If Hinduism proves the existence of it's own concept of God, this would defeat the premise of a monotheistic God, thereby defeating the initial premise of this discussion.
1.4.14.1.2.1. Con: The kind of God that Hinduism proves the existence of is a monotheistic God, so the Hindu proof would not defeat the premise in any way.
1.4.14.1.3. Con: The hindu concept of God is not necessarily incompatible with monotheism.

1.4.14.1.3.1. Con: Hindu followers disagree.

"To call Hinduism monotheistic or to try to scale it down into the perimeters of western monotheistic religions is misleading and erroneous." -- [American Institute of Vedic Studies](https://www.vedanet.com/is-hinduism-a-monotheistic-religion/)
1.4.14.1.3.1.1. Con: The American Institute of Vedic Studies is not remotely representative of what Hindus believe.
1.4.14.1.3.2. Con: While some Hindu followers would agree with the above \("[But in reality Hinduism is monotheistic.](http://www.gitananda.org/faq/is-hinduism-polytheistic-or-monotheistic.html)" --- Swami Radhanandaji\), even those followers would affirm the existence of other "gods" emanating out of the Brahaman. This is incompatible with monotheism.
1.4.14.1.3.3. Con: From the link to owlcation.com above:

"The term “Hinduism” embraces a wide array of philosophies and practices, and while certain Hindus may think and worship in an essentially monotheistic way, the practices of others may be more readily labeled polytheistic or pantheistic. "

It seems that Hinduism doesn't know what it is!
1.4.14.1.3.3.1. Pro: "Worship practices in Hinduism are as diverse as its traditions, and [a Hindu can choose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_deities) to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic, or humanist."
1.4.14.1.4. Pro: From the [link on the root claim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism): "Classical theism is a form of theism in which God is characterized as the absolutely metaphysically ultimate being, in contrast to other conceptions such as pantheism, panentheism, polytheism and process theism."
1.4.14.1.5. Con: Hinduism is the belief of a single God of many faces
1.4.14.2. Con: A belief, like an opinion, does not act as evidence
1.4.15. Pro: -> See discussion #13112: God's Existence Can Be Understood By Rationality.
1.4.16. Con: The theory of God and religion only exist to prevent anarchy.
1.4.16.1. Con: Athetism does not inherently support anarchy.
1.4.16.2. Con: The concept of a superior entity/force/being as the creator of all that exists is a hypothesis, not a theory.
1.4.17. Con: Philosophical arguments support the existence of the [Roman](https://www.oneonta.edu/faculty/farberas/arth/ARTH209/gods_greek_roman.html) and [Norse](https://www.thoughtco.com/norse-mythology-the-best-religious-choice-3975216) Pantheons. \(Both of [which are widely believed](https://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/religion-magic-death-and-rituals/the-old-nordic-religion-today/) to not exist.\)
1.4.17.1. Con: The classical arguments \(the cosmological, contingency, ontological, and moral arguments\) for God's existence would only allow for the existence of a single deity that is common to the general monotheisms.
1.4.18. Con: God is mere anthropomorphism for infinity.
1.4.18.1. Con: If God were an anthropomorphism for a principle, it would be singularity rather than infinity.
1.4.19. Pro: As there is an infinitude of universes, there may be an infinitude of Gods, or, Creators of these infinitude of universes.
1.4.19.1. Con: The only basis we have for believing there are more universes than our own, are theories such as the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics that present a materialist origin for universes besides our own, so there is no reason to theorise about such infinite pantheons.
1.4.20. Pro: Transhumanist arguments support the existence of God.
1.4.20.1. Pro: It is in the nature of all rational beings to perfect themselves. Therefore, God is probably a super-historical descendant of rational beings; or the ultimate expression of rationality.
1.4.20.2. Con: Nothing falling under the label of "transhumanism" can be called God as the term is generally understood.
1.4.21. Pro: [The Transcendental argument for the existence of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_argument_for_the_existence_of_God) is the only way to prove the existence of a God with the ''omni'' properties.
1.4.21.1. Pro: Without the Christian God, your very act of debating is as useless as two cans of soda shaken up and set off fizzing against one another. You have no reason to trust your reason apart from the Christian God. If all we are is a fortunate accident, evolved mud, then we are deterministic machines that do what we do because of the chemistry and physics of our body - and to speak of meaning is utterly meaningless. You must presuppose the Christian God in order to argue against him.
1.4.22. Con: A philosophy is a way of thinking about our existence, about societies, about the nature of the world we live in. It is a study about how we organize our thoughts, without the need of empirical evidence. Therefore, it tends to be a subjective analysis. You can't provide support or evidence for an argument about the existence of a supernatural being by means of a mere reflection or a collection of subjective arguments.
1.4.23. Pro: Nature is the only thing worthy of being called "God." Omnipresence, omnipower and absolute positivity are essencial characteristics of God and is shared by Nature. Therefore, we can conclude Nature is God.
1.4.24. Con: Religion, or any superstition, is a type of irrational thought. Science, logic, etc. are types of rational thought. Rational thought has a proven track record. Lucky shirts, gods, etc. do not.
1.4.25. Con: God and Existence are not clearly defined.
1.4.25.1. Pro: Existence is just an overloaded term: Existence for a teapot is different than existence for a song, that is different from existence for a book character, that is different from existence for a mathematical proof, etc
1.4.25.2. Con: The experience of human existence has also never been scientifically proven and therefore this argument is useless to this debate. We do not understand the brain function or the cognitive sequencing that instantiates our experience of life or the afterlife.
1.4.25.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.4.25.4. Con: Refuting the existence of God by attacking the meaning of the terms "existence" and "God" is a circular reasoning fallacy.
1.4.25.5. Con: This does not disproove Existence of God and can not be used as Con against statemnet that "God Exists". God can exist even if it is not defined. Also Existence exists no matter if it is defined. As Hamlet said the question is "Be or not to Be?" not "Am I or Am I not?".
1.4.25.6. Con: "Existence" is absolutely a finite notion. God, by definition is an infinite notion \(the definition being taken from the ontological "proof", which is not a proof but provides a definition of God: "the highest conceivable entity"\). In this case the whole idea of God falling within some finite, falsifiable system of proof/disproof is meaningless.
1.4.26. Con: Philosophical arguments support the existence of god, the non-existence of god, and the concept that any attempt to prove or disprove the existence of god is futile. Therefore, philosophical arguments are not a reliable source which can be used to support the existence of god.
1.4.26.1. Pro: If god created humans and all that humans are conscious of, it is fair to reason that he may have allowed for no manner by which his existence could be either proven or disproven by the humans he created.
1.4.26.2. Pro: Philosophical arguments can support anything that you want to be true by using the right words and rhetoric. Masters in such discussions in ancient Greece were called [sophists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophist).
1.4.26.2.1. Pro: In the logical arguments for God's existence, God is always defined such that the conclusion of the argument can be ''God exists''.
1.4.26.2.2. Con: Philosophical arguments are often confused with rhetorical arguments. Sophists were masters of rhetoric, they were not philosophers. Rhetoric can be used to support unsubstantiated claims through use of fallacy, philosophy contrarily relies on internal and external consistency, and therefore excludes fallacy.
1.4.26.3. Pro: More things are plausible than true. Supporting something with a philosophical argument is not the same as establishing its likelihood of actually being true.
1.5. Con: Empirical evidence indicates the non-existence of God.
1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.
1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.
1.5.3. Con: Most empirical evidence against God derives from an absence of observations of God. A lack of identified evidence is not a positive argument for the non-existence of God.
1.5.3.1. Con: Lack of evidence for a claim, when evidence for that claim is actively being sought, is indeed an argument for the opposite.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: Claiming that God does not exist because we have not found evidence for his existence is committing the fallacy of [arguing from ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance).
1.5.3.1.2. Con: An all-powerful God by definition would be capable of keeping their existence hidden, assuming that doing so is in the best interests of ultimate morality.
1.5.3.1.3. Con: A claim can be deemed irrational, but without falsifiability it can not be claimed false.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Consider the claim, "There are an even number of electrons in the universe." If there is no good reason to believe this, it would be absurd to then conclude that "There are an odd number of electrons in the universe."
1.5.3.3. Pro: Seeing as science never answers a question to it's full extent, every conclusion opens a new question ad infinitum. In this sense, it is impossible for science to prepotently disregard that God may exist within infinity.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: Science disregards many claims, due to the existence of better explanations. In fact science only regards claims when there is evidence in the first place.
1.5.3.4. Con: The burden of proof for any non-trivial claim rests on the claimant. A claimant who asserts that "the moon is made of marshmallow" should not expect readers to accept the premise without supporting evidence.
1.5.3.5. Pro: Absence of evidence does not entail evidence of absence.
1.5.3.5.1. Pro: Elementary particles existed apart from us being able to generate the evidence.
1.5.3.6. Con: Many of the empirical pieces of evidence of the non-existence of God is derived from instances where there should be divine intervention.
1.5.3.6.1. Con: This claim is subjective, and assumes that the claimant can accurately identify when divine intervention should take place.
1.5.3.6.1.1. Con: A God that is good and all powerful cannot allow suffering, there should therefore be intervention and there isn't in very numerous cases where it is objectively necessary.
1.5.3.6.1.1.1. Con: A God that is all-good must necessarily bring about the greatest good. Personal difficulty and trials are known to build character and foster personal growth, and may be better for the individual in the long run than deliverance from all suffering.
1.5.3.6.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.1.1.7.
1.5.3.6.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.5.2.
1.5.3.6.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.3.5.1.
1.5.3.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.6.1.1.
1.5.3.7. Pro: The evidence of the non-existence of God is relative to our time, it may be the case in the future the evidence prove this thesis as incorrect.
1.5.3.7.1. Con: Both the arguments and the counter-arguments on God has been around for thousands of years.
1.5.3.7.2. Pro: Empirical evidence once indicated that the earth was flat.
1.5.3.8. Pro: We have been unable to measure or observe God as they are largely not perceivable with our senses.
1.5.4. Con: Omniscience implies that God knows what we don't know, omnipotence includes the capacity to withhold evidence, and goodness suggests that God's actions are motivated by good things that we are likely unaware of from our point of view. Thus, if God exists, a lack of scientific evidence to support that existence indicates that there is a good reason for God to withhold that kind of evidence from us.
1.5.4.1. Con: Omnipotence / Omniscience are more of an idea. The terms hold no value until God has proven to exist by other means.
1.5.4.2. Pro: God may actively remove or otherwise manipulate empirical evidence of his existence to maintain the need for faith.
1.5.4.3. Con: This argument takes as given that God exists and that there is a lack of evidence for him, so has no bearing on either of those issues and is irrelevant.
1.5.4.4. Con: Withholding information in this manner is deceptive and thus can be classified as lying. In ideologies involving an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent god, such as Christianity, it is often taught that lying is fundamentally bad. This would make god hypocritical and thus not omnibenevolent.
1.5.5. Con: Since evolution appears to be linear - with greater ability arising as time passes - it is likely that the universe contains higher forms of life than humans - gods, if not God. Projecting this still forward suggests that evolution may be destined toward a 'singularity of self awareness'.
1.5.5.1. Con: Evolution is not as teleological as this claim presents it to be. If you look at the [Galapagos finches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_finches) their beak size oscillates between small and large, in a generation, depending on climate conditions. That is the way evolution works it is not ability being increased but adaption to environment.
This evolve towards godhood is a strange form of god. it is not a god that creates the universe rather it is created by it. It is not a first cause conceptualisation of god.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: Repeated adaptation to environmental conditions seems to increase ability in the long term - single cell to multicellular, chimps to humans. Evolution does swing back and forth, but the overall history of life on earth seems to indicate a linear progression. This can still be viewed as a first cause form of god because the principles producing self aware life - and guiding evolutionary processes at the chemical level - appear to be independently present precursors of life - or God.
1.5.5.2. Con: The idea that evolution provides greater ability as time passes is known as orthogenesis. This idea \(beyond certain localised exceptions\) was abandoned by mainstream biologists in the 1940s - see [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogenesis)
1.5.5.2.1. Con: Orthogenesis was abandoned as a concept because of its connotations - it implied a supernatural force, which is a priori anathema to hyper-rationalists - not because it is logically unsound. The idea behind orthogenesis is that genetic mutations are rarely 'lost' - they merely become inactive within the DNA strand. This means that a creature with 100 million years of evolution behind it will have greater complexity - whether manifested or not - than something with only 10 million years.
1.5.5.2.1.1. Con: Other reasons orthogenesis was abandoned include growing evidence of instances of [regressive evolution](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/reverse-evolution-explained-hagfish-penguins-snakes-science/)
1.5.5.2.1.1.1. Con: There are only a small handful of examples of regressive evolution compared to millions of examples for progressive evolution. Additionally, while evolution does tick back and forth in response to environmental conditions in the short term, over the longer term \(say \>1 million years\) and when examined over multiple species, there is more evidence for an overall increase in biological ability than for the opposite.
1.5.5.2.2. Con: The 1940's were a highly biased time in human history, and scientists are human beings - subject to cultural winds. The hyper-rationalism of the age, which also contributed ideas such as eugenics, contributed to a disdain for anything to do with a higher power. What mainstream scientists thought \(and think today\) is a matter of social consensus, not logical coherence. Until a decade or so ago, plenty of mainstream scientists were of the \(published\) opinion that climate change was a hippie hoax.
1.5.5.2.3. Con: Orthogenesis is *one* of the scientific theories that argues for a linear progression in long term evolution. It was contentious because of its presumption that there was innate 'driving force' that produced this linear progression. The absence of proof for that innate force is what weakens the argument for Orthogenesis. This, however, does nothing to weaken the statement that there is an observed linear trend in evolution over the long term - single celled to multi cellular, apes to humans.
1.5.5.2.4. Con: This argument is a heuristic version of the argument from authority fallacy. Unanimity on a subject in a field does not determine correctness of a statement, rather, a discussion of the facts and theories does.
1.5.5.2.5. Pro: Evolution has a form of \(abstract\) [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure?wprov=sfla1). [Phylogenetic tree in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree?wprov=sfla1)
1.5.5.3. Pro: The presence of self aware life is evidence that the fundamental principles of the universe a\) can either generate self aware life through recombination b\) are themselves a manifestation of self aware life.
1.5.5.4. Con: Since humans are the "highest" known life forms, it is \(by your argument\) unlikely that God exists, that his existence would be fundamental, that He would be omnibenevolent, that He would be omnipresent, infinitely just or omnipotent.
1.5.5.5. Con: This merely moves the goalposts of what a god is and defines it as anything that is sufficiently more advanced than one's self.
1.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.3.3.2.
1.5.7. Pro: It is more likely that people invented the idea of God, than that he actually exists.
1.5.7.1. Con: Whether people invented the idea of God is irrelevant to whether God exists. If someone invented the idea of a dog, that would not make dogs exist any less. What matters for whether we should believe whether there is a God are the merits of the individual arguments, not the history or origin of the ideas or arguments.
1.5.7.1.1. Con: Since the existence of God is not falsifiable, having concrete evidence that someone wrote scripture they considered to be false would be valuable. If we had that evidence we should reasonably doubt the existence of the God referenced by the invented scripture, which may be as strong a statement as we can make given that the existence of God is not falsifiable.
1.5.7.2. Pro: Religion formed naturally from [hyperactive agency detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_detection#Role_in_religion) - a tendency to attribute natural or unexplained events to a sentient agent \(in this case, God\).
1.5.7.2.1. Con: Studies have shown that, while believers in superstition and the paranormal [do show hyperactive agency detection](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810013000974), believers in classical religion don't. In fact, some studies have found that atheists and skeptics often have [underactive agency detection](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130422), meaning they deny the existence of agency even when it is actually there.
1.5.7.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.7.2.
1.5.7.2.3. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.7.3.
1.5.7.2.4. Pro: Psychological studies indicate people have tendency to shift responsibility to somebody else when many people are present. The God could be a target for such shift when no other target is available. [Groupthink in wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink?wprov=sfla1), [Diffusion of responsibility](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility?wprov=sfla1)
1.5.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.7.
1.5.7.4. Pro: Humans are likely to judge incorrectly when they want something to exist and are likely to anthropomorphize. Human error is relevant to the discussion.
1.5.7.4.1. Pro: The concept 'God' is a nothing more than a nature worship, but developed over thousands of years. This idea was able to spread due to people seeking the hope in the most horrible circumstances.
1.5.7.5. Pro: Non-human animals don't manifest a belief in God
1.5.7.5.1. Con: Theists largely agree there is a supernatural \(or, at least spiritual\) distinction between non-human animals and humans. For Christians, the Bible makes a clear distinction between man and animals: in the first letter to the Corinthians: "All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fish, another of birds" \([1 Corinthians 15:39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15&version=NIV)\)
1.5.7.5.2. Con: Non-human animals lack the unique reasoning abilities of humans.
1.5.7.6. Pro: It is natural for any society to invent the concept of a God as a protector and to ensure divine justice. In a patriarchal society, this God would be an omnipotent father figure; the fact that God is male suggests God is a construction.
1.5.7.7. Pro: Modern religions have arisen from human superstition or misunderstanding of phenomena.[Cargo Cults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult)
1.5.7.7.1. Con: Cargo cults make runways and radios and reenact the movements of ground personnel. Their rituals are based on things that exist and events that really happened. Just because they are unable to summon an air drop at their command, does not mean cargo never arrived or that it will never do so again or that it doesn't exist.
1.5.7.7.2. Con: The origins of specific modern Religions and the origin of the Belief in Gods existence are separate questions. Deism for example is a belief in God without Religon. There also is natural theology.
1.5.7.8. Pro: The concept of God has a mundane explanation as a consequence of human desire for power. When individuals with conflicting desires form groups, the group assigns an individual with infinite power representing their shared goals in an attempt to dominate all others.
1.5.7.8.1. Pro: There is also a precedent for this behaviour from the social structures of our genetic ancestors as [primates](https://aeon.co/essays/how-monotheists-modelled-god-on-a-harem-keeping-alpha-male) dominated by a single alpha male - In The Naked Ape \(1967\), the zoologist Desmond Morris wrote that religion’s ‘extreme potency’ is simply a ‘measure of the strength of our fundamental biological tendency, inherited directly from our monkey and ape ancestors, to submit ourselves to an all-powerful, dominant member of the group’. Hector Garcia's [Alpha God](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alpha-God-Psychology-Religious-Oppression/dp/1633880206) explores this connection in depth.
1.5.7.8.2. Pro: As Freud points out in [The Future of an Illusion](https://www.free-ebooks.net/ebook/The-future-of-illusion/pdf?dl&preview) \(p9-10\) this relationship to reality in the face of individual powerlessness is not a surprising one "It has an infantile prototype, of which it is in fact only the continuation. For once before one has found oneself in a similar state of helplessness: as a small child, in relation to one's parents. One had reason to fear them, and especially one's father; and yet one was sure of his protection against the dangers one knew."
1.5.7.8.3. Pro: Nietzsche argues in [The Genealogy of Morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Genealogy_of_Morality) that the origin of Christian values is a rebellion of the oppressed against their oppressors by asserting power and value to their own way of life as slaves. An example that shows this is the statement "the meek shall inherit the earth". To further own this state of slavery a new master created in God, removed power from their real-life oppressors and then asserted that this new master also had power over them as well. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti9zdpLlXf0) is a good explanation.
1.5.7.8.3.1. Con: The Geneology of Morality is a moral argument and does not address the existence of God
1.5.7.8.3.2. Con: Nietsche's writings suggest that arguments for the nonexistence of God are based on man's assumption that since God is unattainable by man, God cannot exist.
1.5.7.8.3.3. Pro: Nietsche's writings suggest that [God is dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_is_dead) \(thus ceasing to exist\).
1.5.7.8.4. Con: This argument could be represented: 

1. If groups of people assign an individual that represents their shared goals with infinite power, then belief in God is a consequence of the human desire for power. 
2. Groups of people assign an individual that represents their shared goals with infinite power.
3. Therefore, belief in God is a consequence of the human desire for power. 
4. Therefore, God does not exist!?!

\(4\) in no way follows as a conclusion and is a non-sequitur.
1.5.7.8.4.1. Con: The argument is that belief in God as a big man in space who cares about humans and where they put their sexual organs is more likely explainable by human psychology and not a result of our own insight into the unknown.
1.5.7.8.5. Con: This argument, rather than engaging with the arguments for God’s existence or discussing what counts as warranted belief in God, seeks to dismiss belief in the thesis “God exists” by explaining how it originated. Thus, this argument commits the [genetic](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yv8L57GAVQ0) fallacy.
1.5.7.8.5.1. Con: Many of the attributes assigned to the concept ‘God’ - sentience, masculinity, have no basis except for the fact that people believe them. Thus how they came to believe them is important when it is the only factor which supports those assertions. Unless any other evidence for those attributes is given, they can be considered irrelevant. All arguments equating a ‘cause’ to ‘God’ need to provide additional justification for those extra attributes to be seriously considered.
1.5.7.8.6. Pro: It is likely that the concept of a God arose from the necessity of civilizations for stability and uniformity, as civilizations which had a God gave meaning to the people, also allowing cooperation between them.
1.5.7.9. Pro: The [Meme hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) is a more plausible explanation for the propagation of the God concept that his truthful existence.
1.5.7.10. Con: It is impossible to define "likeliness"—probability—in a context which cannot be duplicated. There is only one possible context for the reality or non-reality of God, and thus statistical comparisons to generate probabilities is impossible.
1.5.7.10.1. Con: The statement "there is only one possible context for the reality or non-reality of god" is false.  Mistaken belief can be understood and explained in the fields of Psychology, Neuroscience, Anthropology, and Biology.
1.5.7.11. Pro: [Historical Criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_criticism) is the multidisciplinary study of scripture as an academic subject. It demonstrates the human origins of religion by examining sources. For instance, the much older Epic of Gilgamesh was used as source material for, or substantially influenced the Bible, at [multiple points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh#Relationship_to_the_Bible): the Genesis account of Noah and the flood uses the same events in the same order as Gilgamesh.
1.5.7.12. Con: It is unlikely that people who have such complex minds to invent deities or discuss topics such as the existence or nonexistence of God came to be without being created by God.
1.5.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.
1.5.9. Con: The evidence might originate from the enemy of the God, or might be placed as a temptation.
1.5.9.1. Pro: One of the crucial concepts in Bible is concept of snake which deceives Eve, and Satan as the tempter. It is possible he would provide false evidence to trick people
1.5.9.2. Con: Any evidence that does not suit the believer in God might be interpreted as false evidence provided by enemy of the God.
1.5.9.3. Con: Most definitions of a god see it as the creator of everything. The "enemy of god" would be created by god itself. Therefore, the god would hide itself and not actually be hidden by someone else.
1.5.10. Pro: The universe and nature show all the characteristics we would expect if there were no God.
1.5.10.1. Pro: Order and structure in the universe emereges when spans of time are so large that they permit the inefficient, non orderly things to weed themselves out of existence.
1.5.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1.
1.5.10.3. Con: There is positive evidence for the existence of God as the cause of the order and complexity of nature.
1.5.10.3.1. Con: Because an event is rare doesn't mean it is impossible.
1.5.10.3.2. Con: That the universe appears ordered is at best evidence that the universe isn't chaotic. It does not prove that a god exists.
1.5.10.3.3. Con: Order is an emergent property to which humans ascribe meaning \(those emergent properties which are beneficial to humans are order\). It is a truism that in a universe where humans exist there will be phenomena that are beneficial to humans. This is in no way empirical proof for a god or any other mythological figure.
1.5.10.3.4. Pro: In nature, chaos is without order, yet the universe is ordered and complex.
1.5.10.3.4.1. Con: If we look to the clouds we can see faces and familiar shapes.  This is pure chaos, yet we create order in it.
If I throw stuff together in random, something that appears to be order will appear, that does not mean it was meant to exist.  Nor does it mean that our universe could not exist in a completely different form, as such order vs. random is not something we can confirm.
1.5.10.3.5. Con: Order is the result of randomness given meaning.  There are many things in nature that do not fit the prescribed order we have presented and labeled.  We are constantly relabeling, reordering, and re-describing nature as we observe it.
1.5.10.3.6. Con: Complexity is not evidence of creation.
A lot of created objects are extremely simple. Paper clip, post it notes etc. As opposed to extremely complex natural phenomenon, a dandelion seed pod.
Order is also not evidence of creation.
A Jackson pollock painting is extremely disordered as opposed to the growth rings of a tree.
1.5.10.3.6.1. Con: The fact that some created objects are simple does not prove that complex objects need not be. The example of "natural" complex objects does not provide logical evidence against creation.
1.5.10.3.7. Con: This is a fallacy called "personal incredulity". Complex subjects like biological evolution through natural selection require some amount of understanding before one is able to make an informed judgement about the subject at hand; this fallacy is usually used in place of that understanding.
1.5.10.3.8. Pro: A painting is evidence of a painter. A song is evidence of a composer. A house is evidence of a carpenter, roofer, plumber, electrician etc. The universe itself and everything in it is evidence for a creator.
1.5.10.3.8.1. Con: This is not true for non-human made objects. For example for organisms the evidence of their creator is natural selection.
1.5.10.3.8.1.1. Con: If there is a creator, it would work through the process of natural selection to create. This argument would be like saying “paint colours are evidence of differing wavelengths of light, not of a creator”.
1.5.10.3.8.1.1.1. Con: The claim that god works through the process of natural selection does not prove the existence of a god because by definition natural processes do not require a god. A god needs to demonstrate supernatural powers to qualify as such. When a painter creates a painting using a natural process like combining colors of differing wavelengths of light, he can claim to be a creator, but cannot claim to be a god because there is nothing supernatural about the process.
1.5.10.3.8.2. Con: The relationship between a painter and his painting is fully known. We can prove that the painter exists, and we can know fully that the painting was made by a painter by tautology. There is no such tautology or implied relationship between the universe and a god.
1.5.10.3.8.2.1. Con: The relationship between a painting and a painter is implied by the properties of the painting, even when the painter is unknown.
1.5.10.3.8.2.1.1. Con: Properties of nature point to a natural cause not to an intelligent creator.
1.5.10.3.8.3. Con: Unlike a painting there is little evidence that the universe has any overarching purpose.
1.5.10.3.8.3.1. Pro: The inherent presence of purpose is necessary for any kind of creator to be involved. If there was a purpose at the origin of the universe, that's the fulcrum that the religious or creator argument rests. If there is no purpose, and it is a random event, that proves that there is no creator, simply an event that has chain reacted.
1.5.10.3.8.3.2. Pro: Order, or its absence, alone is not evidence of intent and thus a creator. A [Jackson Pollock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock) painting can be less ordered than spilt paint.
1.5.10.3.8.3.3. Pro: Complexity is also not evidence of intent or a creator. A stick figure can be less complex than spilt paint.
1.5.10.3.8.4. Con: If a house is "evidence of a carpenter, roofer, plumber, electrician etc", a whole team of people, then a neighborhood or town or city is evidence of a large number of teams, individuals, and organizations of people building these things - often without collaborating or even communicating with one another. The existence of the universe, with its multitudes of different things, is therefore not evidence of any one specific creator, any more than it is evidence of multitudes of creators or forces.
1.5.10.3.8.5. Con: A stalagmite is not evidence of a stalagmite maker. It is evidence of a natural process.
1.5.10.3.8.5.1. Pro: The same can be said of a river, a mountain, a canyon, a forest, a volcano, planets, the stars even life. They are all evidence of natural processes.
1.5.10.3.8.6. Con: If the universe needs a god to create it, then even God needs a creator. Conversely, if God can exist without a creator, so can the universe.
1.5.10.3.8.6.1. Con: Only things that begin to exist require a creator. The classical definition of God holds that He is eternal and uncreated. Any conception of a god who was created fails to meet the standard of God used in this discussion.
1.5.10.3.8.6.1.1. Con: The universe could also be eternal and/or uncreated in which case no god is necessary.
1.5.10.3.8.6.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.3.2.1.1.1.
1.5.10.3.8.6.1.1.2. Con: Philosophical evidence indicates that the universe cannot be past-eternal.
1.5.10.3.8.6.1.1.2.1. Con: The same evidence would then show that God also cannot be past-eternal. Either nothing is eternal or some things can be eternal. If some thing\(s\) can be eternal then the universe has to be eternal by its own definition.
1.5.10.3.8.6.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The evidence provided specifically attacks the time-dimension of the universe. As classical theism holds that God is timeless, and envisions Him as the creator of time, God is immune from an infinite regress of temporal events.
1.5.10.3.8.6.1.1.2.1.2. Con: It does not follow that because some thing\(s\) can be eternal that the universe must be eternal.
1.5.10.3.8.6.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.4.5.5.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.2.
1.5.10.3.8.7. Con: This argument confuses the content with the container \(the universe\), for which we have no other example to compare with.
1.5.10.4. Con: The Universe "and nature" show all the characteristics we would expect if there was a God \(parent claim is meaningless\).
1.5.10.4.1. Con: What "characteristics of the universe we would expect if there was a God" is elusive.
1.5.11. Pro: The God claim has never produced any discovery, testable theory or improved in any way our understanding of the natural world.
1.5.11.1. Con: Early scientists, Copernicus, Bacon, Newton, Kepler, Galileo, and others studied the universe precisely because they believed that a rational, logical God had created it according to principles that could be discovered. This led to an astonishing number of discoveries, and the development of the scientific method.
1.5.11.1.1. Con: The scientific method, and logic more generally, are independent from the \(non\)existence of God.
1.5.11.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.6.
1.5.11.1.2. Con: People can be inspired by things that do not exist or are not true, such as ideals, dreams or prejudice.
1.5.11.1.3. Con: Newton's claim that God was necessary for the existence of stable orbits in the solar system was proven false: [Principia](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3ANewton's_Principia_\(1846\).djvu/510) vs [modern simulations](https://www.astrobio.net/mars/solar-system-simulation-reveals-planetary-mystery/).
1.5.11.2. Pro: The accepted textbooks on God are the Bible and Qur’an. We all have access to them.  These books state, but don’t prove that God exists. Academics and clerics don’t have magic formulas that turn books into factual proof. They just interpret words. They can’t claim that God does exist until God’s existence is a proven fact. They don’t have proof. Without proof, the existence of God is no more than a theory put forward to explain Universal phenomena. Scientists too are working on such a theory.
1.5.11.3. Con: The debate over the existence of God is irrelevant when it comes to the study of the natural world. There is no such thing as atheist or theist science. There is only science.
1.5.11.4. Pro: [Young Earth Creationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism), is a testable claim that has been demonstrated false.
1.5.11.4.1. Pro: The history of [life](http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/history_of_the_earth) on Earth began about 3.8 billion years ago, initially with single-celled prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria.
1.5.11.4.2. Pro: The [earliest known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery#History) human pottery is approximately twice as old as the age of the Earth predicted by Young Earth Creationists.
1.5.12. Con: It is simply factually incorrect that there is "empirical evidence" that "indicates the non-existence of God".
1.5.12.1. Pro: There is no empirical evidence that God does not exist. There can't be. The concept of God is unfalsifiable.
1.5.12.1.1. Con: There are many concepts of God that are falsifiable and which have been falsified, indicating that this is a concept that likely does not correspond to reality.
1.5.12.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.3.4.
1.5.12.1.2. Con: Concepts of God have been falsified many times leading to a consequent retreat to ever more unfalsifiable versions.
1.5.12.2. Pro: The reliability of empirical evidence cannot be proved empirically and to assume it can is to reason in a circle.
1.5.12.2.1. Con: The reliability of empirical evidence based reasoning is evidenced by new evidence confirming that reliability \(not by the assumption that it is reliable\). It is therefore not circular reasoning.
1.5.12.3. Pro: Looking for empirical evidence for God is a category mistake.  Empirical evidence is something that you can test, observe, and repeat. You can not do this with an immaterial God.
1.5.12.3.1. Pro: Since God is a spiritual entity, there is enough evidence for his existence in the fact that we feel his presence in our hearts and acknowledge it as such through terms like the Holy Ghost. Feeling him is tantamount to seeing him.
1.5.12.3.1.1. Con: The "feeling" of god is anecdotal.

Anecdotal evidence is a place to start a hypothesis, but if it cannot be tested and validated it holds no philosophical or scientific weight. This is a known logical fallacy known as [Hitchens's Razor](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Logical_razor#Hitchens.27s_razor):
"What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence"
1.5.12.3.1.1.1. Con: This argument is irrelevant because of its materialistic or positivist bias: it assumes evidence can only be physical and anything else is anecdotal. This needs to be proven before it can be used as evidence. Stating it is not enough.
1.5.12.3.1.1.1.1. Con: It's not a matter of bias, but rather to work inside the realm of possibilities. It could be stated "I feel this shouldn't be proved" as a response to your argument and it would be just as true as the "I feel god exists" argument because we can't discuss objective truth over feelings. Note that if an assertion is not proven to be false doesn't imply on it being proven true.
1.5.12.3.1.2. Con: This claim assumes that "everyone feels God's presence" is a fact when the feeling of God's presence is not clearly defined.
1.5.12.3.1.3. Con: Deriving a conclusion about the existence of a spiritual entity from a premise about the existence of another spiritual entity is circular and entails infinite regress.
1.5.12.3.1.4. Con: Many others do not share this subjective feeling of "God's presence," and may in fact have equally strong subjective feelings that God is an illusion or fantasy. Neither subjective feeling counts as evidence for or against the existence of God.
1.5.12.3.2. Pro: Positive evidence is not needed for belief in God.
1.5.12.3.2.1. Con: Belief is subjective, and is not relevant to a discussion regarding the objective ontology of an entity \(e.g. God\).
1.5.12.3.2.2. Con: Belief in the existence of God can be, and often is, held with no justification in regards to the truth of that idea. That is however not a reasonable stance and does not provide justification for the existence of God.
1.5.12.3.2.3. Con: For the belief in God to be justified, it needs something that justifies it. The evidence is one of the grounds for justification that theists lack.
1.5.12.3.3. Pro: Empirical evidence could not prove the existence nor the nonexistence of God, it could only prove the existence of physical things that you could feel and experience such as tables and chairs and the wind. Love or friendship are examples of things that cannot be proven with these methods.
1.5.12.3.3.1. Con: Yet there is empirical evidence for friendship, often found in the actions of friends. Same goes for love. The existence of evidence contradicting the expected actions of a friend or a god are evidence against their existence.
1.5.12.3.3.2. Con: While it might be true that it is impossible to empirically know or prove the existence of love between people, the behavior of the suspected lovers is knowable, and behavior is commonly accepted as evidence of internal emotional states.
1.5.12.3.4. Pro: An inmaterial God cannot interact with physical world. There is not empirical evidence for abilities of interacting with the physical world without being a material thing made by atoms. You can't interact with atoms if you are not made by elementary particles.
1.5.12.3.4.1. Con: Photons \(and subatomic particles\) interact with the physical world and are not made of atoms.
1.5.12.3.4.2. Con: [Psychosomatic reactions](https://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_psychosomatic_response\]) are a material body's reaction to an immaterial thought.
1.5.12.3.4.3. Con: Gravity is a force and it does not seem to have a material existence. It is action at a distance. We don't know what gravity is but we know that it is.
1.5.12.3.4.4. Con: The classical God is claimed to have multiple effects on the physical world, therefore observable evidence of its existence is rightfully expected.
1.5.12.3.5. Con: -> See 1.5.12.3.4.4.
1.5.12.3.6. Pro: If we accept that empirical evidence can conclude that God doesn't exist in this way, then we would also have to accept that we should conclude the immaterial mind doesn't exist, even though we know it does exist.
1.5.12.3.7. Con: There is no distinction between the idea of immaterial and nonexistent. The immaterial \(concepts, ideas, descriptors, abstractions\) is at best descriptive of things, but cannot rationally be claimed as existent.
1.5.12.3.7.1. Con: Being subjective does not exempt something from existence. Love, courage, skepticism, doubt, etc. are all said to exist because they are known and understood properties of the human experience
1.5.12.3.7.2. Con: Theism is a set of rational claims to God's existence
1.5.12.3.7.3. Con: One can rationally come to differing conclusions. Only a person with the ability to access all the information in the universe could come to a singular absolute truth with no alternative possibilities
1.5.12.3.7.4. Con: If "immaterial" equals "nonexistent", then only physical objects exist. This is an absurdly restrictive meaning of "existence", as it excludes, among other things, all thought and emotion.
1.5.12.3.7.5. Con: An idea can be, and in fact many times is, transformed into a material object. For example, the idea of a flying machine ultimately turned into an airplane. Therefore ideas exist as they're the proven source of later built objects.
1.5.12.3.8. Pro: Logical positivists argue that "one can not speak about causality on a meta-physical level". Therefore this argument is invalid.
1.5.12.3.8.1. Con: [Logical Positivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism)'s central tenet has been shown to be self-contradictory. The philosophy holds that "only statements verifiable through empirical observation are cognitively meaningful." \(See link.\) 

As that statement is not verifiable through empirical observation, the Logical Positivist cannot hold that statement to be meaningful.
1.5.12.3.8.2. Pro: [Logical positivists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism) would also argue that such concept of God \(purely metaphysical\) is empirically unverifiable and therefore meaningless.
1.5.12.3.9. Con: If the universe is stated to have been created by god \(which is how god is defined in this conversation\), and the universe is material, this claim cannot be logically sustained. 

The universe is stated to be material evidence of god, redefining god so there can be no material evidence for a god constitutes an admission that the god, as defined here, doesn't exist. 

In this context the "immaterial" and the non-existent are the same thing.
1.5.12.4. Con: Different assumptions about God may be falsifiable, leading to conclusion that he does not exist.
1.5.12.4.1. Con: This conclusion would be premature. By disproving a related assumption one does not disprove the main premise, however removal of assumption may modify that premise
1.5.13. Con: Against all odds we exist as a part of a perfect system.
1.5.13.1. Con: Assuming that God exists does not change those odds, being therefore not even an explanation for the existence of this system.
1.5.13.2. Con: Since the outcome is known \(we do exist\), the probability accounts only for our ignorance of how it came to pass. It is then assumed from ignorance of cause that God is the cause. Ignorance is however neither reason nor evidence for the existence of God.
1.5.13.2.1. Con: Our "ignorance of cause" is not total. We inhabit a universe that shows every indication of being designed. In every single instance when we see such a system and the cause is well-known, a designer is responsible. It is reasonable to infer a designer of the universe based on that experience. This inference is not an argument from ignorance, but from knowledge.
1.5.13.3. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.5.13.4. Pro: Quantum physics has provided us empirical evidence suggesting the complete opposite of this statement. Against all odds all things should not exist and yet they do in a system of perfect balance.
1.5.13.4.1. Con: This is purelly a misconception regarding the concept of observation in science which does not refer to a conscious observer, but merelly to interactions between things.
1.5.13.4.2. Con: Quantum mechanics predicts that matter can spontaneously come into existence.
1.5.13.4.2.1. Con: Quantum mechanics predicts that [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy?wprov=sfla1) is a valid principle that the universe conforms to.
1.5.13.4.3. Con: -> See 1.5.13.2.
1.5.13.4.4. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.5.13.4.5. Pro: Quantum physics has proven we as observers play a role in the unfolding of our reality which matches the practice of prayer and meditation in spirituality.
1.5.13.4.5.1. Con: There are interpretations of quantum mechanics where observation doesn't play a special role. Even in interpretations where observation is considered special, the 'observer' doesn't need to have consciouness - machines can be 'observers' too.
1.5.14. Con: -> See 1.2.2.7.5.
1.5.15. Con: "Empirical evidence" can neither prove that God does or does not exist.
1.5.16. Con: A study MRI study was conducted which showed that an individual's brain "lit up" when they felt the holy ghost.[archive.sltrib.com](http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=4617561&itype=CMSID)
1.5.17. Con: A God, as described in this discussion, may hide any evidence of His existence and still being part of the reality.
1.5.18. Con: Empirical evidence deals with physical reality. The concept of God is the concept of a non-physical being, so you shouldn't expect to prove the existence of God empirically. That being said, God's existence is, in fact, an empirically adequate claim.
1.5.19. Con: Empirical evidence cannot possibly indicate the non-existence of morality, rationality, beauty, and other metaphysical concepts such as a deity.
1.5.20. Con: If God created this reality as a test to judge our faith, then real evidence of his existence would be deliberately made hard if not impossible.
1.5.21. Pro: The burden of proof for God's existence has not been met.
1.5.21.1. Con: This does not prove that God does not exist.
1.5.21.1.1. Con: The claims under the main thesis \(God exists.\) do not need to prove that God doesn't exist. \([burden of proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_\(philosophy\))\)
1.5.21.2. Con: No finite being that is not omniscient is competent to adjudicate whether or not the "burden of proof" for God's existence has or has not been met.
1.5.21.2.1. Con: Consistent application of this standard would result in humans not being able to know anything at all, so this standard is useless in practice.
1.5.21.2.2. Con: This argument is circular. It boils down to: The only way to properly assess the evidence for the existence of God, is if God shows me how it should be assessed.
1.5.21.3. Pro: Knowing/Proving something exists annuls belief.
1.5.21.3.1. Con: By that standard you know of no thing that exists. Because any claim about existence requires some faith. We could always live in a simulated reality for example.
1.5.21.3.1.1. Con: Anything that can be observed exists in at least some form or capacity, even if that existence is contained within a single mind.
1.5.21.3.1.2. Con: Faith as taken from a religious perspective is completely different from the philosophical faith that science refers to. The first one does not require empyrical evidence, the second one must provide it.
1.5.21.3.2. Con: Theoretical physicists, as well as Astro-physicists and anthropologists, would certainly take issue with this as they believe in many things that can not be known absolutely and the proof they bring is purely abstract or theoretical itself. Despite this, because it is “proven” in the abstract \(often mathematically\) they claim it is “known” but ultimately it boils down to “belief”. Good examples would be string theory or the Big Bang or the transition from hunter/gatherers to agriculturalists.
1.5.21.3.3. Con: God does not only want us to have faith that He exists but also faith that He is who He says He is \(good, trustworthy, praiseworthy\). Thus, even if we could prove God exists, we still need belief \(faith\) to trust He is always acting in our good, etc. \(He 11:6\).
1.5.21.4. Pro: If a critical variable or constant \(a [topological invariant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_property)\) in the universe function is to be required one must prove the function fails to evaluate if the variable is withheld.
1.5.21.4.1. Pro: Adding variables with no impact on the result of a function to the function is equivalent to adding zero to the function.
1.5.21.4.2. Con: If one is the critical variable the impact to the universe function would be equivalent to multiplying by one because one is omnipresent in all topologies.
1.5.21.5. Con: The burden of proof for a universe created from nothing has not been met.
1.5.21.5.1. Con: Red Herring argument. this does not refute the original point.
1.5.21.5.1.1. Con: You could argue that the original argument is a red herring from the start. You can claim that the existence of the universe itself and the laws of cause and effect are enough evidence for an ultimate cause, i.e. God.
1.5.21.5.1.2. Con: This is an argument from fallacy, simply showing a fallacy within a sub-argument does not suffice to actually address any of the argument's merits.
1.5.21.6. Con: 'Burden of Proof' is a subjective term which is unknowable and impossible to evaluate it's criteria. Everyone has a different standard of proof. Objectively, we can only evaluate God's existence on available evidence, which is a different argument.
1.5.21.6.1. Con: If the question posed is looking for an objective answer, the criteria is a significant majority positive confirmation by scientific communities around the world based on a reproducible test. Therefore, the burden of proof has indeed not been met.
1.5.21.7. Pro: A metaphysical being has not yet been definitively observed, and therefore, has not yet been definitively proven to exist.
1.5.21.7.1. Con: Metaphysical suggests highly abstract & beyond nature so observation is not a possibility. If it were to be observed it could no longer be considered metaphysical and would certainly not qualify as deity. Rather, like all metaphysical matters, God is not known by direct observation but an observation of His signs and indications in the physical or “natural” world. That there is a physical world is itself proof of a metaphysical will which chos to bring it into existence from pure non-existence.
1.5.21.8. Con: Having no proof of God's nonexistence, at least his existence cannot be dismissed as a clear false.
1.5.21.8.1. Con: Red herring fallacy: This argument bears no direct relationship to its parent claim. The truth value of the parent claim is unaffected by this claim's truth value, so even when this line of reasoning is sound, it can't be used to prove its opposite proposition is true.
1.5.21.9. Con: On the other hand, the proof of God’s non-existence could only be based on reasoning which could be controversial, for non-existence is nothingness, which is intangible or non-physical & could never be seen or heard, i.e., if God were indeed non-existent no one would be able to know for sure as hard incontrovertible physical or experimental evidence proving it, which is nothingness, is an impossibility.
1.5.21.10. Con: The existence of a perfectly moral "lawgiver" is the only rational way to explain objective morality, thus giving proof of God \(or at least as close as you can get to "proof"\).
1.5.21.10.1. Con: Objective morality does not exist, so there is no need to explain it.
1.5.21.11. Con: Irrefutable proof will never be found - because free will to believe or not believe is intrinsic to being a person. It is our right to not believe as much as its our right to believe. This is not a place of enlightenment but it is a place where facility is there if chosen.
1.5.21.11.1. Con: Whether God's existence or nonexistence is more than a mere fact about the universe, and has any more impact on our free will and humanity than knowing whether the sky is green or blue, is an assertion that requires justification.
1.5.21.12. Con: "Burden of proof" is a term used purely for determining when evidence obliges a particular response. Usually the one asking the other person to change their behaviour or to take action \(eg. asking the state to punish someone\) carries the "burden of proof". Since this debate is only about the truth of the matter and is not about how people should act "burden of proof" is meaningless in this context.
1.5.21.13. Con: There is not supposed to be proof of Gods existence. That would negate the idea of faith, which is the very basis of Judeo-Christian religion.
1.5.21.14. Con: The burden is not on the greater being to justify itself to the lesser being. If God exists you do not have the right to demand he submit to your authentication.
1.5.21.14.1. Con: This argument [begs the question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question), as it self-admittedly only applies if God exists.
1.5.21.14.2. Con: Assuming God demands submission is a human condition thrust upon others, by a specific religious doctrine. The statement in and of itself, demonstrates more about your belief system than it does anything for the existence of God.
1.5.21.14.3. Con: This argument is a red herring. The burden of proof is placed on those making the claim that a god exists, not the god itself. The reason that this is the case is that the burden of proof is the duty placed upon a party to prove or disprove a disputed claim and is placed on the party making the claim, in this case monotheists.
1.5.22. Pro: The shared understanding of God is disassociated from the record of how religious leaders act in accordance to their shared core beliefs, on such a large scale that would suggest there was no God at all.
1.5.22.1. Pro: God, as the [Abrahamic religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religions) understand him, formed a covenant with Abraham. This suggests they share the same God, yet these religions' historical relationships and questionable leadership tactics are proof enough that God does not exist.
1.5.22.1.1. Con: -> See discussion #8539: Religion has been a good thing for humankind.
1.5.22.1.2. Pro: The [holy wars and conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_violence#Abrahamic_religions) between each other are in direct opposition to their [core beliefs](http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr10cisl.htm), and are especially troubling in light of the fact they follow the same God.
1.5.22.1.2.1. Pro: The similarities between the [core teachings of these religions](http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr10cisl.htm) suggest looking after one another is one's duty, and that killing one another is morally wrong.
1.5.22.1.2.2. Pro: The leaders of [these religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religions), that share genealogy, instructed their followers that these merciless murders were a [noble path to attain salvation.](https://books.google.com/books?id=0fooSsaO6rMC&pg=PA1&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f=false)
1.5.22.1.2.3. Con: Claims to follow the same God do not mean that they do, in fact, follow the same God.
1.5.22.1.2.3.1. Con: They [share genealogy](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-06-26/news/0306260340_1_three-faiths-abrahamic-creator-god), Abraham is a founder of all three, that do in fact worship the same God.
1.5.22.1.2.3.2. Pro: It is commonly assumed that the concept of God is consistent across Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. This is not the case in many of the most important aspects of any understanding of God, including salvation, his relationship with men, and many other key considerations.
1.5.22.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: In Christianity, God is Trinitarian... one God consisting of three persons. Judaism and Islam are strictly Unitarian... one God, one person.
1.5.22.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: In Islam, salvation is found in obedience to Allah. In Christianity, salvation is found by faith in Christ's obedience to God through his salvific death and resurrection.
1.5.22.1.2.3.2.3. Pro: In Christianity, God is knowable on intimate terms... we can call him "Abba Father". This is less true in Judaism, and blasphemous in Islam, in which God is considered to be so "other" to man that he is practically incomprehensible.
1.5.22.1.2.3.2.4. Con: The idea of god may differ religion to religion, just as their cultures and traditions do, but the account of god's covenant with Abraham is indicated in each religion's foundational narrative. From self-reported accounts of genealogy, these religions follow the same god.
1.5.22.1.2.3.2.4.1. Con: A few shared stories are hardly sufficient to claim identity. If God is immutable, and these religions differ about key aspects of God, it's obvious that at least two \(and perhaps all three\) of them are wrong in their belief.
1.5.22.1.2.3.2.5. Con: -> See 1.5.22.1.2.3.1.
1.5.22.1.2.3.2.6. Con: The sanctity of the one true God has been corrupted by desires of money, power, and through the illusion of choice.
1.5.22.1.3. Con: -> See 1.5.22.1.2.3.2.
1.5.22.1.4. Con: The interpretations that different people take and their actions upon those interpretations do not affect His existence.
1.5.22.1.5. Con: This assumes that ignoring something \(e.g. in this case God and his laws\) is the same as it not existing, which in untrue
1.5.22.1.6. Con: The same God who made a covenant with Abraham warned the family of Abraham against false prophets, teachers, etc, which suggests that many associated with Abraham would claim to know God but would know wrongly.
1.5.22.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.22.1.2.3.2.6.
1.5.22.2. Con: Religious leaders and this so called "Subversion" are their choices as individual leaders which are fundamentally people still. God is Immutable and also God is able to change any aspect of Creation.Creation is an aspect of God's will or in other words:creation is one of God's artworks painted with the crayons of life and death.
1.5.22.2.1. Con: If it were God's will that those actions not be done, an all-knowing, all-powerful, and benevolent being would do something to stop those individuals from gaining those positions of power. Yet, through the [course of history](https://books.google.com/books?id=0fooSsaO6rMC&pg=PA1&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f=false) has not done so.
1.5.22.3. Pro: God is not immutable. Religious leaders subvert his will in the aim of greater political power and material wealth.
1.5.22.3.1. Pro: Rabbis, Priests, and Imams have historically been caught or found guilty of abusing their positions of power for sex with children. Pedophilia sex being understood as an act of dominance, would suggest these religious leaders acted to perversely declare their power.
1.5.22.3.1.1. Con: Those religious leaders are not acting in accordance with his teaching, so their words/actions do not reflect God's.
1.5.22.3.1.1.1. Con: Yet their followers believe otherwise, act on their leaders' teachings, and die believing they deserve eternal salvation.
1.5.22.3.1.1.2. Con: God as an all-knowing, all-powerful and completely good being intervened heavily during the time the scriptures narrate. If he existed, he would intervene at some point, or stop those individuals from becoming leaders of his followers in the first place. But he did not.
1.5.22.3.2. Pro: Christian leaders sold indulgences to the wealthy in return for mitigated punishments for wrongdoings.
1.5.22.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.22.3.1.1.
1.5.22.4. Con: -> See 1.5.22.3.1.1.
1.5.22.5. Con: The "disassociation" from the "record of how religious leaders act in accordance to their shared core beliefs" \[sic\] could equally "suggest" that God as described in the Bible does in fact exist and that he did in fact create beings with the capacity for meaningful choice, even the choice to act in discordance with his own personality and design.
1.5.22.5.1. Con: Then God is either not all powerful, or all good.
1.5.22.6. Con: Making blanket generalizations about all "religious leaders" on the basis of the behavior of some "religious leaders" is invalid.
1.5.22.6.1. Con: No one is referring to all religions, this claim focuses on the Abrahamic religions.
1.5.22.7. Pro: Religious leaders don't necessarily have anything to do with God. There are those who try to act in God's name and those who do not. We are called to a relationship with His Son Jesus Christ which must NEVER go through other men.
1.5.22.8. Con: The two ideas in this statement are not linked. Solely because there is wide debate on a topic does not mean that the entire topic is invalid. Many aspects of politics are hotly debated, but this does not mean that the freedom for anyone to murder without punishment is any less wrong.
1.6. Con: God may have been intentionally invented as a means to control the masses.
1.6.1. Pro: Example would be religion that incorporates caste system.
1.6.1.1. Con: These religions seem likely to have started as justifications for existing hierarchies that are then made rigid because of the religion's justification. The religion comes after the social hierarchy, it does not create the hierarchy from a previous state of equality.
1.6.2. Pro: There clearly is reason to do so, as people tend to obey commands with absolute \(divine\) justification
1.6.3. Con: Believers appear to be serious about claiming his/her/their existence.
1.6.4. Con: This is highly unlikely as all societies have adopted religion in some form and they are unlikely to all have coincidentally fallen prey to manipulative governance.
1.6.4.1. Con: It is inherently very difficult to estimate the likelihood of such statements, which makes it a rhetoric, not an actual argument.
1.6.4.2. Con: Humans are humans and our brains are wired in certain ways, which make certain patterns arise across cultures. Human cultures independently have a lot in common.
1.6.4.3. Con: Even early on in our history, ideas have spread far and wide over the millennia, e.g. the Neolithic Revolution which spread the technology of farming across most of the world. Religion or some of its forms could have been spread similarly, especially if they demand missionary practices.
1.6.4.4. Con: The monotheistic capital-G God under discussion only originated in a few places, and could have been a manipulative invention even if the older polytheistic/animist traditions did not have such an origin.
1.6.4.5. Con: As an example, the Catholic pope has historically been very wealthy and held a lot of power. Even if Catholicism were an invention, it would not be hard to see how it spread through colonisation and war.
1.6.5. Pro: Religious institutions have historically held power over masses.
1.6.6. Con: A ruler \(ruling class\) diminishes their own power, rights, and authority by inventing a deity whose power supercedes their own.
1.6.6.1. Con: Unless the ruling class claim: \(1\) to be the deity \(e.g. Pharaohs\) or \(2\) that they are appointed by the deity \(e.g. European Monarchy\) In such cases, their power, rights and authority are increased.
1.6.7. Con: This propose implies a too complex and direct awareness of the human communication laws. It's widely more probable that the 'centralized' concept of mediator between humanity and divinity came after the birth of the concept of God and its spread inside the communities.
1.6.8. Con: This does not address whether He exists or not; maybe evolutionary theory was developed by atheists to 'control' Christians, but its validity as a theory is not affected by this.
1.6.8.1. Con: If it were true, it would decrease the probability of god being real, hence it does address the problem.
1.6.8.2. Con: There is lots of evidence supporting the thesis that god was invented to control people, whereas there is no/little evidence supporting the thesis that evolution was invented by atheists to control Christians.
1.6.9. Pro: Looking at world religions through the eyes of cultural evolution, it is clear that the more controlling \(and "jealous"\) gods / religions tend to spread further than the more lax belief systems.
1.6.10. Con: The concept of God is intuitive and resides in the psychological commons. Religion, on the other hand, is an invention to portray a certain understanding of God and it is a human creation.
1.6.11. Con: In many communist countries, God is banned to control the masses. So the concept of an absence of God must have been intentionally invented by humans.
1.7. Con: The formation of an all powerful consciousness has an unimaginably low possibility when compared to the formation of known complex entities
1.7.1. Con: God was not formed but has always been.
1.7.1.1. Con: The parent claim is about Occamian priors, "having always existed" is just another addition to the complexity of the God hypothesis making it yet more improbable.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: The parent isn’t an additional explanation but a correction of a straw man. The grandparent claim is that God was formed which is highly unlikely because we don’t see complex things forming very often by natural processes. God isn’t believed to have formed by natural causes.
1.7.1.1.2. Con: “God always existed’ is a claim of equal if not more simplicity to the claim that a singularity was the uncaused cause of the universe. To assert that the cause of the universe is not supernatural is complicated because one would have to explain how a cause is not the effect of another cause, which is the natural order of all observed causes in history. It is straightforward to say that the uncaused cause is supernatural \(not natural or beyond natural\).
1.7.2. Con: This claim is a misunderstanding of the definition of God provided in the stem claim.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.
