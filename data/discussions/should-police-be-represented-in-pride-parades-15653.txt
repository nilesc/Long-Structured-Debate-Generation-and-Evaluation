1. Police should not be represented at Pride.
1.1. Con: Police just wants to pinkwash its history with queer communities.
1.1.1. Pro: Marching in the parade is an attempt to smooth over their image in the community.
1.1.1.1. Con: The police force has many LGBTQ members.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Many of these [officers](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/gay-police-officers-still-fear-for-their-careers-poll-shows-9716585.html) also fear for their lives and careers as well.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Members of the LGBTQ community may feel more secure if they saw more of themselves in their local police offices, but this isn't always the case.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: The police force also has many minority officers, however minorities are still disproportionately targeted.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: [The Gay Officers Action League](https://www.advocate.com/current-issue/2018/7/18/lgbt-group-changing-nypd-within) \(GOAL\) has chapters nationally made up of officers who are also part of the LGBTQ community.
1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: These members of the police force should be allowed at Pride, as it celebrates a major part of their identity.

1.4.1. Pro: [In Indonesia](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-lgbt-police/new-police-taskforce-to-target-indonesian-gays-idUSKBN18K10A), a new police taskforce was put together targeting discriminatory action against activity within the LGBTQ community.
1.4.2. Pro: The [police and military](http://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/04/20/uniformed-injustice-police-military-target-lgbt-salvadorans/) in El Salvador regularly and violently target those in the LGBTQ community, including such offenses as rape.
1.4.3. Pro: [Some police](http://latina-1051845746.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/lifestyle/our-issues/police-officers-asked-target-blacks-latinos-lgbtq) are told by their superiors to target members of the Black, Hispanic, and LGBTQ communities.
1.4.4. Pro: This has historically been the case in the US since long before the [the Stonewall riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots). Police targeted gay bars, and laws in some areas required some degree of conformity to gender roles in regards to dress.

1.5.4. Pro: Separating will continue to perpetuate the tensions between members of the LGBTQ community and police.
