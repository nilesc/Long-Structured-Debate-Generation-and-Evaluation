Discussion Title: Should health care providers annually be made to get the flu vaccine?

1. Health care providers should be mandated to get the flu vaccine
1.1. Con: If we are going to force one group to do it we should force everyone to get vaccinated.
1.1.1. Con: "Force"\(mandates\) for vaccine should target populations that are at risk, or key links in the chain of transmission\(like healthcare workers\).
1.1.2. Con: Forcing someone to do something they don't want to do is oppression.
1.1.2.1. Pro: We don't force vaccination for much more dangerous pathogens.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: We do mandate certain vaccines for children to enter school, including ones the more serious childhood diseases and extremely infectious ones like measles.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: In almost all States, there are both religious and philosophical \(personal belief\) exemptions for parents to reject these mandates and allow their children to go unvaccinated.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: 47 states in the USA allow religious exemptions from student vaccines and 18 allow philosophical exemptions from student vaccines. [Source](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx)
1.1.2.1.3. Con: [OSHA](https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_BloodborneFacts/bbfact05.pdf) recommends Hepatitis B vaccination for healthcare workers with exposure to bloodborne pathogens, and many hospitals [require](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/menus/hepatitisb/index.html) it due to liability concerns
1.2. Con: In some cases people can have a strong reaction to the vaccine, such as feeling sicker.
1.2.1. Pro: [1-2% of people will have mild side effects](https://www.livescience.com/40279-flu-shot-information.html) such as low grade fever, aches, and swelling at the injection site.
1.2.2. Con: While individuals who cannot take the vaccine because of side effects or other illnesses that makes it impossible, health care providers without such circumstances should feel obligated to vaccinate themselves in order to protect those patients and coworkers that cannot be vaccinated themselves.
1.2.3. Con: Except in specific cases \(children under two and pregnant women\) the [flu vaccine](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/in-depth/flu-shots/art-20048000?pg=2) is a dead virus which cannot make you sick, if you have legitimate reactions to the vaccine they are going to be allergic reactions, usually to eggs because eggs are used as incubators for the virus.
1.3. Pro: Providers have taken the responsibility of treating people. Not vaccinating and possibly exposing patients to the flu is irresponsible and dangerous.
1.3.1. Con: The Cochrane Review [reports](http://www.cochrane.org/CD005187/ARI_influenza-vaccination-healthcare-workers-who-care-people-aged-60-or-older-living-long-term-care) that vaccinating healthcare workers does not reduce hospitalization or death in the nursing home population.
1.3.1.1. Con: The \(parent claim\) study is a pooled review of three clinical trials, which are all questioned for their unclear methods, as well as lack of compliance in the treatment arm \(i.e. the people being studied for efficacy of the flu shot, may not have actually gotten their flu shot.\)
1.3.1.2. Con: [This](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24046301) 2014 study from Clinical Infectious Disease found evidence that immunizing healthcare workers against the flu does have a protective effect in reducing mortality rates of their patients in long-term care facilities and hospitals. The evidence was weaker, for a protective effect on morbidity.
1.3.2. Con: It is impossible to avoid flu exposure during flu season and no flu vaccine is effective against all strains.
1.4. Con: Health providers should have the autonomy to decide not to get vaccinated every year.
1.4.1. Pro: Every patient should have the bodily autonomy to accept or refuse a vaccine. In this case, health Care workers are also somebody's patients. Therefore healthcare workers should also have the right to refuse a vaccine.
1.4.1.1. Con: But the patients they may put at increased risk have no real choice about contact with those workers, their health situation and hospitalisation has removed their bodily autonomy to a great degree.
1.4.2. Con: Food service workers don't have a choice\(other than quitting their job\) about following sanitation procedures in how they prepare food. All kinds of workers don't have a choice about whether to wear the company uniform, show up on time, etc. Their autonomy is limited by their agreement to follow company/industry guidelines when they accept the job. Make this a guideline, meaning people can apply for exceptions, but in the absence of an exception, getting the vaccine will be the "default" option.
1.4.3. Pro: Health care providers should voluntarily get vaccinated in order to protect their patients. Modest rates of vaccination on a voluntary basis are preferable to higher rates achieved through mandates and coercion.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Health providers should set a good example to the rest of the population.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Health care providers \(physicians, nurses, pharmacists\) are ethically bound to cause no harm. Not being vaccinated against influenza opens patients to unnecessary harms. Given the ethical duty to put the patient's health first, providers should not have an option not to be vaccinated, except in extraordinary circumstances.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Healthcare organizations can use their employees as a more reliable database for feedback on the vaccination because those who work in healthcare are more likely to report any unexpected side effects.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: You do not experiment on your most important people. In fact, you do not experiment on people in the first place.
1.4.3.1.3. Pro: It is reasonable for the public to expect a healthcare provider to be vaccinated since that healthcare provider, as part of the healthcare community, advises the public to become vaccinated.
1.4.4. Pro: Individual objections such as veganism or possible [allergic reactions](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/egg-allergies.htm) should be valid reason to decline the vaccination.
1.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.6. Pro: Influenza results in a large amount of leave required for sick hospital staff. Mandatory vaccination may reduce the risk of this happening. [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29514719/?i=1&from=mandatory%20influenza%20vaccination)
1.6.1. Con: Due to the constantly changing strains of influenza, the flu vaccine is not as effective as other vaccines as it must constantly be changed.
1.6.1.1. Pro: [This study](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/215/7/1059/2979766?redirectedFrom=fulltext) found that vaccine efficacy may decrease in subsequent years, if one gets the flu shot every year
1.6.1.2. Con: Partial effectiveness is still better than none.
1.6.1.3. Pro: The [Effectiveness of the Immunizations](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/effectiveness-studies.htm) is variable and often low.  Health care providers should be able to evaluate the benefit vs the risk in regards to their own health until science can reliably create vaccines.
1.7. Con: The strain of flu each year is largely determined by for profit pharmaceutical companies and subject to  [error](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-flu-vaccines-so-often-fail).  Employers should not be able to mandate a product that generates revenue for private companies.
1.7.1. Pro: The CDC increased communication of the flu vaccine recommendations based on [pharmacy companies reporting](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/lawrence-solomon/death-by-influenza_b_4661442.html) they had not received enough orders for the vaccine.
1.7.1.1. Con: The cited article is an op-ed piece in the Huffpost which uses loaded terms to describe the CDC's methods for "hyping" the vaccine and "panicking" the public. What it describes is basically a public-service campaign by the CDC to encourage vaccination. CDC does not have a profit interest in vaccine uptake; it is a government agency charged with improving public health.
1.7.2. Con: The particular strains that go into the vaccine each year are not chosen by for-profit companies. They are [recommended by a panel from the World Health Organization, and then selected by regulatory bodies in each country.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/vaccine-selection.htm) \(In the U.S., the selection is made by the Food and Drug Administration\)
1.7.3. Con: Private companies make seat belts, condoms and fire extinguishers. They profit from recommendations on public safety, and they adjust their products\(or their profits suffer\) based on changes in those recommendations. Evidence of vaccine efficacy should not be suppressed out of a desire to avoid profiting these companies.
1.8. Pro: Providers are exposed to sickness more often and are more likely to become ill from the flu.
1.8.1. Pro: Healthcare personnel are roughly twice as likely to contract influenza than the general population, according to a [26 study meta-analysis.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162061)
1.8.2. Con: Providers might have more opportunity to build up natural, alternative immunity, without needing a vaccine.
1.8.2.1. Con: As the influenza virus is constantly changing, it is hard to develop a natural immunity to it.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: There are people with a higher antibody count against the part of the virus that doesn't change, which results in [less viral shedding](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/flu-infection-study-increases-understanding-natural-immunity) when they get infected.
1.8.3. Pro: Providers see patients when they're already sick, patients could become sicker due to the flu.
1.9. Con: Receiving a flu shot is part of an individual's personal medical history and employers should not have access to that information if an employee chooses not to release it.
1.9.1. Pro: Healthcare personnel in the United States are already required to provide vaccination records and obtain certain vaccinations. Influenza is not distinct from these other requirements except for frequency of vaccination.
1.9.2. Pro: An employer in the health care industry should also have the right to employ or not employ based on proof of a current flu vaccination.
1.10. Con: If there is a low supply of the vaccine, we should give them to the most vulnerable \(the elderly and children\) rather than force providers to get them.
1.10.1. Con: Vaccines work due to [herd immunity](https://www.vaccinestoday.eu/stories/what-is-herd-immunity/), giving a handful of vaccines even to those most likely to get effected is an exercise in futility. It makes more sense to immunize  health care workers since they are the ones most likely to spread it around in the case of an outbreak.
1.11. Con: Many new prescription drugs pose a [health risk](https://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/new-prescription-drugs-major-health-risk-few-offsetting-advantages).
1.11.1. Pro: To avoid complications, doctors often recommend patients wait and use new drugs as a last option only.
1.12. Con: Health care providers, of all people, should not require coercion to take part in health prevention measures. Health care providers are more than qualified to weigh up the risks and benefits of vaccines. If they reject a vaccine it must be after careful consideration.
1.13. Con: The flu vaccine may [cause](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/06/09/vaccine-kidney-health.aspx) kidney damage and kidney failure.
1.13.1. Con: The source above talks about people who have already been hospitalised. Upon doing [further research](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/common-vaccine-ingredient-linked-kidney-injury) people whose kidneys are already damaged will respond negatively to some vaccinations. This however does not mean that normal people will have a higher chance of kidney damage if they took a shot.
1.14. Con: People who are vaccinated shed the flu virus more than those who are not. [thewilddoc.com](https://www.thewilddoc.com/cdc-funded-study-shows-the-vaccinated-shed-6-3-times-more-flu-virus-just-by-breathing/)
1.14.1. Con: The above interpretation disregards the fact that vaccinated people are[less likely](https://apnews.com/fa0014a59d1b4ad5866c3c813de745fc) to get flu in the first place.
1.14.2. Con: The [study](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/17/1716561115) cited in the blog above only included 178 participants with influenza, only 22% of which had received the vaccine. This study only applies to one season of influenza.
1.15. Con: Previous flu shots [may raise the risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2850386/) for pandemic flu.
1.16. Con: Flu shots have [not been proven](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4407759/) to be very effective especially among the elderly.
1.17. Con: Flu shots have [caused](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/07/29/2015-17503/national-vaccine-injury-compensation-program-revisions-to-the-vaccine-injury-table#t-1) many cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome.
