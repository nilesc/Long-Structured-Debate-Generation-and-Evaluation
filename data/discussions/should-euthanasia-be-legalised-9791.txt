Discussion Title: Should Euthanasia Be Legalised?

1. Euthanasia should be legalised.
1.1. Pro: Euthanasia can end unnecessary suffering.
1.1.1. Con: It is uncertain whether suffering truly ends with death. Many worldviews believe that both suffering and pleasure exist beyond life.
1.1.2. Con: Mental stress can be highly attenuated if the patient is surrounded by a loving family and if the patient does not feel that they're a burden to those around them.
1.2. Pro: People don't have to travel far or in fear of conviction for helping a loved one.
1.3. Pro: To let someone suffer until death is just as bad as murder.
1.3.1. Con: If we reduce life to good/healthy/fun parts we would directly or indirectly dictate what life is worth living what is exactly what we are trying to avoid.
1.4. Pro: Euthanasia is cheaper for society, than alternatives such as expensive terminal care.
1.5. Pro: Legalised euthanasia is safer than forcing people to seek the alternative option themselves.
1.5.1. Pro: Alternatives \(suicide, assisted suicide\) can fail and carry a risk of injury.
1.5.2. Pro: Badly implemented suicides can cause direct collateral damage.
1.6. Pro: Legalised euthanasia is less stigmatising than suicide or the non-legal alternatives.
1.6.1. Pro: There would no longer be criminal stigma for the professionals performing the euthanasia.
1.6.1.1. Con: There is a danger that the professionals might also be given the power to decide who lives and who dies to where the choice no longer belongs to the patient.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Like any other medical procedure, there will be a system of checks and balances and a standard of care. Negligence will be prosecuted like in any other medical procedure, there is little risk that doctors would become serial murderers.
1.7. Pro: [Passive Euthanasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia#Passive_and_active_euthanasia) \(ie withdrawing Life Support\) is already commonplace and has not run into any of the predicted Cons for Active Euthanasia \(Taking an action to cause death\).
1.8. Pro: People have free will they should be allowed to choose when they die if they are suffering excessively.
1.9. Con: Assisted suicide can be seen as actual murder.
1.9.1. Con: Legally it won't be seen as murder if it's legalized and regulated - that's the point of it.
1.10. Pro: If someone has e.g. no quality of life, is terminally ill - anyone who is of sound mind and wishes to chose their end of life should be allowed to choose.
1.11. Con: God gave life so only He can take it.
1.11.1. Con: People murder. If only god takes life, god is the entity that takes the murder victim's life. Suicide would be the same.
1.11.2. Con: God's existance is debatable, to ones who don't believe god exists it is not a valid point.
1.11.3. Con: God doesn't exist.
1.11.3.1. Con: The nonexistence of God has not been proven.
1.11.4. Con: Euthanasia is a legal issue, not a religious one. Its legalization or outlawing should not, in a secular state, be discussed in religious terms.
1.11.5. Con: God is known to allow people to kill other people.
1.12. Con: Vulnerable people could be forced into euthanasia.
1.12.1. Con: Safeguards would be put in place.  Countries with euthanasia/assisted suicide use checks like requiring people to be "mentally competent" and "suffering intolerably" \([Canada](http://www.cbc.ca/firsthand/m_features/misconceptions-about-medical-aid-in-dying-in-canada)\). In Luxembourg, the process involves "[two doctors and a panel of experts](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JV13BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT97&lpg=PT97&dq=%22two+doctors+and+a+panel+of+experts%22+luxembourg&source=bl&ots=gapVbF5XVb&sig=9HTtX-FPwqCmoB1pWs07P9wN--U&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwja0ZPXhqHbAhXKLMAKHRyqAn8Q6AEISDAF#v=onepage&q=%22two%20doctors%20and%20a%20panel%20of%20experts%22%20luxembourg&f=false)".
1.13. Con: Euthanasia is a selfish act.
1.13.1. Con: Euthanasia can mean relief for not just the person who's being euthanised but also for the loved ones of that person as well.
1.13.1.1. Pro: Loved ones can experience a lot of pain from watching a person they love live a life that is mostly suffering without having the ability to help.
1.13.1.2. Con: That relief for the loved ones could mean that some people would choose euthanasia to stop being a burden, even though they don't really want to die.
1.13.2. Con: Perhaps because suicide is often seen as selfish is potential grounds for legalizing euthanasia. If the will to die is irrational, the carrying out of regulated euthanasia would insert rational actors between the irrational patient and the ultimate decision. The physician/counsellor would be able to weigh/mitigate the effects on the family and also society as a whole.
1.13.3. Con: Demanding someone continues their life, despite them not wanting too, is a selfish act.
1.13.4. Con: The eventual selfishness of an act cannot be considered per se as a legitimate basis for outlawing something.
1.13.4.1. Pro: Selfishness per se is not sufficient justification. Taking the best looking apple at the grocery store is 'selfish,' and while perhaps could be stretched to be in a sense amoral, it is not illegal. Society doesn't have laws against 'selfish acts.'
1.13.5. Con: A selfish act is not necessarily an act which justifies legal repercussions.
