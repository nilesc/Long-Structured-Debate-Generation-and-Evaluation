Discussion Title: Is eating meat ethically wrong?

1. Eating meat is wrong.
1.1. Pro: Animals are pretty, and remind us of humans. Plants and insects don't, so no one should care if they are killed.
1.2. Con: It's not ethically wrong since the definition of "ethical" is "a set of moral values and principles that guide the human conduct in the society". Knowing that, the larger part of society eats meat and doesn't see any problem in this. Thus we can declare it not ethically wrong.
1.2.1. Con: Rather than 'a set of moral values and principles that are currently guiding the human conduct in the society', the useful definition of ethical is 'a set of moral values and principles that we should want to use to guide human conduct in the society'. This is the reasoning that all influential ethical systems have \(Kant, utilitarianism, virtue ethics\).
1.2.1.1. Pro: Kantian ethics with the categorical imperative describes that for an action to be ethically acceptable one must be able to will everyone to take this action. Kantian ethics thus prescribes the way an individual should act and reasons that this would improve society.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Utilitarianism prescribes that for an action to be acceptable, the sum of all impacts on the utility of all beings -there is some discussion on whether this should include animals- should be positive. It indeed argues that if all people would act in this way society would be improved.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Virtue ethics tells people to keep to virtues \(temperance, prudence, courage, and justice\) and keep away from the vices one becomes a good person because the effect on society is good.
1.2.2. Con: Making absolute statements about right and wrong is an error. Right and wrong are always relative.
1.2.2.1. Con: It is highly debatable whether moralism, or "right and wrong", is in fact relative. While eating meat can be considered necessary for survival in some \(very rare\) situations, it cannot, even in said situations, be considered "\[morally\] right" to do so, so long as we agree that killing another thing \(including plants and bacteria\) is always carried out due to an apparent necessity, not because it is preferable. There can never be a moral defense for killing something.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Eating \(even human\) meat when your plane crashed in the Himalayas is right, for it saves your life. Eating meat just for some palatal pleasure, causing suffering to a living being, while there would be other means to sustain yourself, can be perceived as wrong.
1.2.3. Con: By the same argument, slavery was not wrong when Roman or European empires practiced it. Slavery is wrong, thus, this argument tells us nothing about right or wrong.
1.2.3.1. Con: In Roman times a large portion of slaves were acquired as a side product of military conquest. Often, the invader could not leave these people alive harboring revenge, so alternative for slavery would be death. Being alive in slavery is better than being dead, so slavery was not inherently wrong in this context. And if the newly acquired slaves would disagree, they could commit a suicide.
1.2.3.2. Con: Slavery was not wrong from their perspective.
1.2.4. Con: While moral values are indeed relative, most people despite cultural or religious differences can agree that inflicting pain on others is wrong.
1.2.5. Con: The moral value of an action can only be evaluated by the consequences that action has on the sentient beings that are affected by it. Since human actions affect a lot more than humans, ethics should transcend human-only centered societal norms and codes of conduct.
1.2.5.1. Con: By combing ethics and morality this address a different point than morality alone.
1.2.6. Con: Just because people eat meat doesn't mean they do not consider this problematic. Many meat-eaters might indeed see this as a problem but, for one reason or another, do not eat vegetarian.
1.2.6.1. Pro: In some countries it can be difficult to eat vegetarian, and especially so on social occasions, for example in [Japan](https://thisjapaneselife.org/2011/09/07/japan-vegetarian-food/) and [Korea](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170616000474).
1.3. Pro: Many revered thinkers and spiritual leaders were vegetarians.
1.3.1. Pro: 500 years ago Leonardo da Vinci was busy writing and part of his writing was about his anger of humans eating animals.  He called humans the King of animals or rather he said the King of Beasts since that is how we act-beastly.
1.3.1.1. Con: There are plenty of traits we share with beasts - we copulate, we defecate, we urinate, we breathe, we are territorial etc. It is arbitrary of someone to decide how many traits one must share with someone to be ''like them''.
1.3.2. Con: There have also been terrible people who were vegetarians, with Hitler being the best-known example.
1.3.2.1. Con: Hitler was not a vegetarian until at least 1938, even then sometimes eating liver dumplings and caviar. His diet is widely acknowledged to be on the recommendation of his doctor to reduce his flatulence, and his vegetarianism then used as propaganda.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Other testimonies show that he may have been much more [dedicated](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/9859294/Hitlers-food-taster-speaks-of-Fuhrers-vegetarian-diet.html) to vegetarianism.
1.3.3. Con: This is an argument from authority. Presumably those thinkers and leaders had rationales that might be persuasive to the undecided but the simple fact of their dietary choices is not.
1.3.4. Con: The majority of spiritual leaders and thinkers were not vegetarians. Personal diet preference \(or any other conclusion by a person of prominence\) without the underlying grounds/reasoning is irrelevant.
1.3.5. Pro: The Buddha is generally assumed [to have been vegetarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_vegetarianism) after reaching enlightenment.
1.3.6. Pro: Einstein also [saw](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/224638-nothing-will-benefit-human-health-and-increase-the-chances-for) the benefits of an evolution away from meat: "Nothing will benefit human health and increase the chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.”
1.3.6.1. Con: Einstein was a physicist, not a nutritionist, or evolutionary biologist. His views are his own opinions, not expertise in his field.
1.3.7. Pro: Gandhi, on his path to nonviolence, also [saw](http://www.azquotes.com/quote/588394) the benefits of an evolution to a plant based society: “I do feel that spiritual progress does demand at some stage that we should cease to kill our fellow creatures for the satisfaction of our bodily wants.”
1.3.8. Con: Jesus of Nazareth regularly ate [fish and kosher meat](https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2016/25-november/features/features/what-would-jesus-eat).
1.4. Con: It is natural for humans to eat meat.
1.4.1. Pro: It is a natural and beneficial part of our ecosystem for organisms to kill and eat what is below them in the food chain. As humans are at the very top of the food chain, eating meat is natural.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Population control is an important function of the food chain.
1.4.1.2. Con: Humans are not within the natural food chain of nature, except when they live as hunters or when they catch wild fish. Yet even in such cases, they are not irreplaceable. Usually there are parallel predators in an ecosystem that can play human's part in population control.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: The Inuit people, for example, [hunt different sorts of animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit#Diet), including both predators and their usual prey \(e.g., polar bears and seals\). In such case, we have no guarantee that human activity is necessary to control the populations of these animals.
1.4.1.3. Con: The majority of the animals consumed by humans are raised as cattle and are therefore outside of the natural food chain.
1.4.1.4. Con: Humans are [depleting the oceans](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120920-are-we-running-out-of-fish) through over-fishing, which is actually destroying species rather than keeping them under control.
1.4.1.5. Con: Several species have gone extinct due to over-hunting but also due to indirect human activities such as pollution \(for example [in Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extinct_animals_of_Australia)\).
1.4.2. Con: Just because something is natural doesn't mean it's right. Lots of things are natural, but not considered right.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Moving away from what is 'natural' has allowed us to raise our moral standards and quality of life, for example by sanitizing water, using antibiotics, developing tools to ease the burden of farming and imposing laws on human society. What is natural does not define what is ethical.
1.4.2.2. Pro: It is questionable whether it is helpful to think of natural events in categories of 'right' and 'wrong' in the first place.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: In some cases, a virus will be released on purpose for the greater good, eg. for population control of [rabbits](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-24/rabbit-virus-kits-enables-farmers-to-eradicate-the-pests/8298266) in Australia.
1.4.3. Con: Nothing humanity does is natural, and it is only through artificial means that people are able to eat meat, whether it be the fire and spears of our ancestors or the factory farms and sous-vide of the modern day.
1.4.3.1. Con: Our technology that gives us dominion over nature is as natural as a beaver building a dam.
1.4.3.2. Con: Everything humanity does is natural. Humans are a byproduct \(i.e. a child\) of nature, and can therefore not be differentiated from nature, nor can anything we create be considered as a separate entity, given the above stated relationship.
1.4.3.3. Con: There are other animals who use tools and their intelligence to acquire food - chimps using sticks to hunt termites or otters using rocks to smash oysters. If using tools is natural for them, then it is also natural for humans.
1.4.4. Pro: Humans eating animals is as natural as animals eating animals.
1.4.4.1. Con: We tend to differentiate humans from animals.
1.4.4.2. Con: Not all animals eat animals which make this claim inconsistent.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: The parent claim only said that there are animals that eat animals. It didn't say every animal does.
1.4.4.3. Con: The behaviour of other animals can't justify our ethical decisions. For example, lions commit infanticide but we cannot use that explanation to justify killing children
1.4.4.4. Con: Animals do not have a choice, they have to eat other animals to survive, and don't have the cognitive abilities to take an ethical stance on eating animals. Humans have choice and can be perfectly healthy without meat.
1.4.4.4.1. Con: It is inconsistent to consider animals exempt from ethical obligations but protected by ethical rights.
1.4.4.5. Pro: While it may seem unethical to kill another being, we have to realize that we are on the top of the food chain and that it is one of our roles in nature to pick off animals lower on the food chain. Without this regulation some animal populations would grow too large.
1.4.5. Pro: Humans are omnivorous. In fact our jaws started to [shrink](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-dawn-farming-changed-our-mouths-worst-180954167/) [after](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/08/25/birth-farming-caused-jaw-dropping-changes-human-skull-scientists/) the invention of farming, which leads to our problems with teeth placement.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Being omnivorous is a survival trait. Handy for when there is something like another potato blight like in the 1840’s or a massive outbreak of a disease among livestock.
1.4.6. Pro: It is a law of nature that some animals get eaten and others eat. Humans are not different. They are just another animal whose weapon is not claws or strong jaws, but rather its intelligence.
1.4.6.1. Con: Based on this argument it should be "right" for a strong person to kill a physically weak person in order to obtain their food and resources, since this is also part of "law of nature".
1.4.6.2. Con: Human societies are ruled by different laws than those of the "jungle".
1.4.6.3. Pro: Chimpanzees, which are our relatives, [hunt](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~stanford/chimphunt.html) in groups and eat smaller monkeys.
1.4.6.4. Con: Humans' intelligence enables them to make ethical considerations when choosing how to keep evolving. It further enables us to find alternative ways to evolve \(eg. by producing meat alternatives\). Therefore, the law of nature need not apply to humans in the same way that it applies to animals.
1.4.7. Con: If we were supposed to eat meat as other predators, we would be able eat it raw and tear it with our teeth.
1.4.7.1. Con: Human beings regularly eat raw meat and have done so for a long time. For example: Steak Tartare \(raw beef\), Mett \(raw pork\) and Toriwasa \(raw chicken\). So we definitely can and do eat raw meat.
1.4.7.2. Con: Humans are not in need of means to eat raw meat. They have a large brain and can therefore prepare food to be easily digestible, for example [by cooking it](https://harvardmagazine.com/2009/11/cooking-and-human-evolution).
1.4.7.3. Con: Human beings are predatory; we have the physiology and psychological makeup to hunt and kill other animals. This is no different from a wolf killing and eating another animal.
1.4.7.4. Con: Neanderthals' diet was almost exclusively [predatory](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160314091128.htm), yet they used fire only [sporadically](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/02/the-first-fire/515427/). Thus, at least our [ancestors](https://gizmodo.com/humans-have-even-more-neanderthal-dna-than-we-realized-1819182225) were able to digest raw meat on a regular basis.
1.4.7.5. Con: Pandas are herbivores, and yet the best [bait for panda is roast goat](https://books.google.de/books?id=bsNBaYNTDB0C&pg=PA242&lpg=PA242&dq=panda+traps+baited+with+roast+goat&source=bl&ots=RiipUUtOQI&sig=wgabgYnk4DRfSBcXis7FpqVGu6c&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjE9an0ouLcAhXSDOwKHcbqAPsQ6AEwCnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=panda%20traps%20baited%20with%20roast%20goat&f=false). Thus, an animal need not be carnivorous to eat and like meat.
1.4.7.6. Con: Culinary is a kind of [external digestion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_digestion#Extracellular_digestion_in_other_animals), which is employed by some kinds of predators, in particular those who prey on meat but are unable to tear it with their teeth \([or lacking them whatsoever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath_birdeater)\).
1.4.7.7. Con: Chimps, being our closest relatives, are able to eat raw meat with their teeth alongside with other non-meat foods, sometimes [cannibalizing](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/chimpanzees-chimp-tyrant-eat-cannibal-tyrannical-leader-a-propos-of-nothing-a7557916.html) on their kin.
1.4.7.8. Con: This implies that we should not use any non-physical trait we possess to our advantage. We are as dominant as we are because we use our intellect, which enables us to do things we couldn't do with our bare hands.
1.4.7.8.1. Pro: That we rely on tools to eat meat not only doesn't mean we aren't meant to eat meat. It might actually support the idea that we are meant to eat meat as these tools are superior to teeth, for example because they can be replaced once broken.
1.4.7.8.1.1. Con: Primate canines were never meant to be used for eating meat. Many other primates are herbivores and have larger canines than humans did, e.g. Gelada Baboon, which is completely vegetarian with grass accounting for 90% of it's diet. Or the Gorilla, whose diet is almost exclusively plant based, with the only animals they do consume being insects like termites and caterpillars.
1.4.7.8.1.2. Con: Humans have never had large canines. Early human canines from before we developed tools were smaller than those of other modern herbivore primates.
1.4.8. Con: There is nothing natural about the mass-production of animals at factory farms. The way we consume meat today is very different from the way it takes in place in a natural state.
1.4.8.1. Con: There is also nothing ''natural'' about farming crops, in the same fashion as with farming animals. So, the argument fails, since the only alternative would be returning to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle of old \(which would set back humanity for several millennia\).
1.4.8.2. Con: The argument is ignoratio elenchi. The question at hand is if eating meat is ethically wrong not if mass-production is natural or not. While related, the statements do not imply each other.
1.4.8.3. Con: The world is too diversified to classify something as "natural" or "unnatural".
1.4.8.3.1. Pro: It is impossible to draw a clear line between natural and not natural as even animals showcase forms of behavior that one might not immediately consider as natural, such as the use of tools, the establishment of social hierarchies and the construction of infrastructure, such as dams.
1.4.8.3.1.1. Con: It's hard to draw a line. But not impossible. One standard for deciding whether something is natural is the occurrence of a phenomenon throughout different cultures and times. In that definition homosexuality is natural, self destructive behaviour is natural, aggressive behaviour is natural, extreme intelligence is natural.
1.4.8.3.2. Con: One can say something is natural/not natural despite humanity being diverse. The sex drive is natural. Communication is natural. Hunger is natural.
1.4.9. Con: Humans have a long gut like herbivores and teeth [best suited to](http://www.adaptt.org/documents/Mills%20The%20Comparative%20Anatomy%20of%20Eating1.pdf) eating plant matter.
1.4.9.1. Con: We don't have the herbivorous [digestive tract](https://www.webmd.com/g00/heartburn-gerd/your-digestive-system?i10c.encReferrer=&i10c.ua=1&i10c.dv=14#1). In fact, we don't get as much nutrition from vegetables as cow, for example, does.
1.4.10. Con: Eating meat is cultural - some populations are traditionally vegetarian, just as some traditionally eat insects.
1.4.10.1. Con: It is not just cultural since it was a fundamental part of the evolution of our species for thousands of years.
1.4.11. Pro: Primitive humans have evolved some [features for long-distance running](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03052), their method of choice for hunting by tiring their prey out.
1.4.11.1. Con: Humans have also evolved features [for fist-fighting](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/brv.12112) \(strong face bones, bigger first two knuckles\), but this doesn't mean that's an activity we should incorporate in our day-to-day.
1.4.12. Pro: Eating meat has been a natural and important part [of human evolution](http://time.com/4252373/meat-eating-veganism-evolution/), and has enabled us to develop higher reasoning skills.
1.4.12.1. Con: While it was true for our past, for modern 21st century humans with the technology to farm and distribute highly nutrient rich foods, eating meat becomes unnecessary as a nutrient rich source of food, and reasons for eating it do no rely on this.
1.4.12.2. Con: Even if it were true that eating meat spurred evolution, that is not an argument to keep doing it. Assume for a moment that the competition created by wars spurred human evolution. That would not make it morally right to fight wars.
1.4.12.3. Con: This is based on a common misconception, it is [the act of cooking](https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2015/08/10/starchy-carbs--not-a-paleo-diet--advanced-the-human-race.html) that made us human, not eating meat.
1.4.13. Con: -> See 1.4.8.3.
1.4.14. Con: Even though eating meat may be natural, the way people eat meat today isn't any more natural than the eating of highly processed and "un-natural" foods. Mentally, we hardly ever establish a clear link between the meat we eat and animal life"
1.4.14.1. Pro: Many people dislike the idea of an [edible petting zoo](https://www.zotter.at/en/zotter-experience/attractions/edible-zoo.html), where you can meet and pet the animal, before choosing to eat it.
1.4.14.2. Con: By this logic, eating vegetables isn't particularly natural either as they are grown on large farms, oftentimes far away from the regions where they naturally grow, with the help of pesticides and technology such as LED lights, and as part of a global industry that treats food as a commodity.
1.4.14.3. Con: Even in the industrialized West there are rural places where people live closer to farm animals and slaughter, as well as fishing villages. In those types of places the children learn early on about the connection between eating meat and killing animals.
1.4.15. Con: Research indicates that it is [by no means clear](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/meat-eating-among-the-earliest-humans) how much meat our ancestors were actually eating.
1.4.15.1. Con: The [same research](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/meat-eating-among-the-earliest-humans) indicates that the increasing share of meat in the diet of our ancestors led to many of the physical and social changes that made us evolve into our current form. Meat and human development therefore go together.
1.4.16. Con: Claiming something "natural" must consider all other elements of nature around the subject. We cannot consider meat eating natural when we lack the natural biological tools on our bodies to catch the type of animals we consume. For example, a human is naturally unable to catch and kill a cow with the small and weak human nails and jaw, a human is unable to bite through animal skin and digest raw meat in abundant quantity. Therefore claiming that eating a cow is natural is false. Others similar.
1.4.16.1. Con: -> See 1.4.7.8.1.
1.4.16.2. Con: One reason why we get wrinkles on our fingers when we get wet is believed to be for the purpose of [catching fish](https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/pruny-fingers-are-evolutionary-advantage/).
1.5. Pro: A vegetarian diet is healthier than an omnivorous diet.
1.5.1. Pro: The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics takes the [official position](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886704) that vegetarian diets are healthy, potentially prevent diseases and reduce health risks compared to other diets.
1.5.2. Pro: A vegetarian diet makes it easier to keep or reach a healthy weight than an omnivorous diet.
1.5.2.1. Con: The vegetarian diet only excludes meat. A vegetarian diet can also be unhealthy, for example if you only eat french fries.
1.5.2.2. Pro: [Numerous studies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11606-015-3390-7) suggest that a vegetarian diet is more effective for losing weight than a non-vegetarian diet.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: Vegetarian \(vegan in particular\) diets aren't the only diets who have a benefit for fat loss. An example for a diet with numerous studies concluding it benefits weight loss is "low-carbohydrate, high-fat" \(LCHF\): [it makes people on such a diet less hungry](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/92/10/4052/2598628) and [is effective for weight loss.](http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0256-95742013001100013)
1.5.2.3. Pro: Among women, those with a vegetarian or semi-vegetarian diet have a [lower risk of obesity](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/81/6/1267/4648730) than those with other diets.
1.5.2.4. Pro: The rate of overweight or obese individuals [is lower](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/64/4/175/1911289) among vegetarians than among non-vegetarians.
1.5.2.4.1. Con: There is a bias in this study and most related studies considering the fact that vegetarians have a tendency to [care more about what they eat](https://chriskresser.com/why-you-should-think-twice-about-vegetarian-and-vegan-diets/) and therefore eat healthier food, including organic.
1.5.2.4.1.1. Con: [Research](https://www.popsci.com/vegetarian-vegan-not-always-healthy) has shown that many vegetarians and vegans eat a lot of processed food, which puts them at risk for cardiovascular health issues.
1.5.3. Con: Vegetarian diet needs proper supplementation or a wide [knowledge about nutrition](http://nutrition.ucdavis.edu/content/infosheets/factsheets/fact-pro-vegetarian.pdf) to avoid deficiency.
1.5.3.1. Con: It is not true that a wider knowledge about nutrition is needed to avoid deficiency. I'm a life long vegan or vegetarian and have been an elite level athlete for many years. I am completely healthy and I am a total idiot.
1.5.3.2. Con: With all the harmful additives, surplus salt/sugar, excess fat, hormones, antibiotics, etc. in our food sources, any healthy diet nowadays requires a wider nutritional knowledge. Having meat in one's diet does not mean that diet is not nutritionally deficient.
1.5.4. Con: Vegetarianism is neither a healthy or unhealthy diet. Everything comes to nutrition consciousness.
1.5.5. Con: Just because something is healthy doesn't necessarily make it ethically right or wrong.
1.5.6. Con: The argument is a false dilemma as there are many vegetarian diets and many omnivorous diets. While there are common diets of each type that are unhealthy, only the optimal diet could be relevant in an argument, and that diet would contain at least some meat.
1.5.7. Con: Meat is the most complete source of essential protein the human body [needs](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/animal-vs-plant-protein#section2) to survive and be healthy.
1.5.7.1. Con: Meat and some meat products can be rich in saturated fats, which contain cholesterol. Consuming saturated fats increases the risk of acquiring a heart disease \([www.nhs.uk](https://www.nhs.uk/livewell/goodfood/pages/eat-less-saturated-fat.aspx)\).
1.5.7.1.1. Con: The fact that some meats are rich in saturated fats doesn't mean that they should be avoided alltogether, but rather consumed in quantites that are in the limits of healthy and balanced diet.
1.5.7.1.2. Con: New studies show there is no evidence for increased heart disease when consuming foods which are rich in saturated fats and cholesterol. [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4836695/)
1.5.7.2. Con: Some cultures have been vegetarian for a long time, such as hindus in India. Some of the longest living groups of people on earth were found to eat mostly plant based diets such as in Okinawa, or even currently [California Seventh-Day Adventists vegetarians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11434797).
1.5.8. Con: Some nutrients for the brain cannot be obtained from plants. For example, the only good sources of Vitamin B12 are [meat and fish](http://www.businessinsider.com/5-brain-nutrients-that-you-cant-get-from-plants-2013-10?IR=T). A Vitamin B12 deficiency can result in anemia, impaired brain function, mental disorders and a smaller brain.
1.5.8.1. Con: There are [valuable sources](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4042564/) of plant-based foods that provide enough B12, for example dried [seaweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nori).
1.5.8.2. Con: Microbial fermentation of bacteria [can be and is used](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5282855/) to create B12 for supplemental vitamin pills, so it is not necessary to eat meat or fish to avoid a deficiency.
1.5.8.3. Con: [Eggs and dairy](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/ask-a-health-expert/how-can-i-get-enough-vitamin-b12-if-i-dont-eat-meat/article16777645/) also contain significant amounts of B12.
1.5.8.3.1. Con: Eggs and dairy are just as immoral as meat to consume.
1.5.8.3.1.1. Pro: Male baby chicks are ground up alive or suffocated on their first day of life because they aren't profitable to the egg industry.
1.5.8.3.1.2. Pro: Egg hens have their beaks and claws cut off without painkillers.
1.5.8.3.1.3. Pro: The dairy industry treats cows [in cruel ways](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/30/dairy-scary-public-farming-calves-pens-alternatives). It keeps them for months indoors, forcefully separates them from their calfs, oftentimes kills male calfs, and uses growth hormones to optimize yield to the point that cow's bodies break down.
1.5.8.3.1.4. Pro: Egg laying hens are kept in crowded cages or sheds if free range. This is a health risk because they urinate and defecate on each other, often they can't reach food or water, and because there are so many they can't form a natural pecking order which leads to violence and mental trauma.
1.5.9. Pro: Red meat [was classified](http://www.who.int/features/qa/cancer-red-meat/en/) by the World Health Organization as probably including substances that cause cancer in humans.
1.6. Pro: Eating meat means accepting the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.
1.6.1. Pro: Modern farming methods like factory farming of animals is a danger to health.
1.6.1.1. Pro: The way farm animals are herded close together in the current meat-industry increases chances for epidemic diseases to spread. This includes ones that can also hurt humans, for example [Q fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_fever).
1.6.2. Con: Raising an animal for meat does not imply harmful treatment.
1.6.2.1. Con: However, raising enough animals to provide meat for everyone does imply intensive farming, which is definitely harmful.
1.6.2.2. Con: It's true that raising animals for meat does not necessarily harm them, but what matters is that many who raise them do make them suffer. So, even though animal farming doesn't necessarily harm all animals, the easiest and most reliable way of ensuring that no animals are harmed is to not eat meat in the first place
1.6.2.2.1. Con: With very little research it is possible to find ethical sources of meat locally. It is not very difficult. Well treated livestock live much more gentle and comfortable lives than their counterparts in the wilderness.
1.6.2.3. Con: While people may mean well, if they lack training they can provide poor care to animals.
1.6.2.4. Pro: If you raise animals yourself and take care of them from birth to death it is quite possible to treat the animals relatively uncruelly.
1.6.2.4.1. Con: Most people in the western countries live in large cities where it is very difficult if not impossible to raise your own animals. In US, for example, [over 80%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization_in_the_United_States) of the population live in urban areas.
1.6.2.4.2. Con: Just because something is done in a non-harmful way does not mean that it is ethically right
1.6.2.4.2.1. Pro: It would, for example, be obviously ethically wrong to raise human beings in a non-harmful way in order to harvest their bodies \(for example, selling human organs in a commercial market\).
1.6.2.5. Con: The vast majority of animals raised for food are held in industrial conditions which clearly do not provide sufficient welfare.
1.6.2.5.1. Pro: The keeping of sows in gestation crates in industrial pig farming is an example of extreme animal suffering in the context of such farming. In these crates, sows are unable to move around and even to turn around. There these animals "chew on the bars, wave their heads incessantly back and forth, or lie on the pavement in an apparent state of dejection" \([www.humanesociety.org](http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/confinement_farm/facts/gestation_crates.html)\).
1.6.2.5.2. Con: Existing examples of bad aminal caring don't imply it's average.
1.6.2.6. Con: Raising an animal for meat means you have to kill it eventually, no matter how kindly you treat it before that.
1.6.2.6.1. Con: This outcome is still better than the most likely alternative. Any animal raised for meat, \(provided this is done ethically\) would be subject to far more suffering in the wild, and would almost certainly be killed prematurely by predators anyways.
1.6.2.6.2. Pro: So far, there isn't any painless method for killing animals.
1.6.2.6.2.1. Con: A skilled hunter is capable of killing an animal in a much less painful or terrifying way than other predators in the wild. Most dedicated hunters take this responsibility seriously.
1.6.2.6.2.2. Pro: The methods usually employed to kill farm animals cause extreme pain. Stunning is not always used prior to slaughter \(as in halal slaughter and home slaughter throughout the world\) and stunning can also fail. There is evidence that some pigs gassed with carbon dioxide as a stunning method [can remain conscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_slaughter#Stunning).
1.6.2.6.2.3. Con: It's enough to make the animal unconscious before killing it and this can be done without use of chemicals, for example placing it in oxygen-free atmosphere or by a phycisal impact.
1.6.2.6.2.3.1. Pro: We're able to determine how long an organism can function without oxygen. For humans it is about 15 seconds and no more than 20. After this time the nervous system stops working, causing both lack of consciousness and ability to feel pain.
1.6.2.6.2.3.1.1. Con: [Only inert gases seem to cause painless asphyxiation \(although not in all species\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_gas_asphyxiation), while asphyxiation due to high levels of carbon dioxide, which is a toxic gas, can cause distress in animals.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2. Con: One cannot be sure that lack of consciousness means full inability to feel pain.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.1. Pro: Although not very common, [anaesthesia awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia_awareness#Outcomes) is an example of how someone can feel pain even after a procedure that is meant to leave him/her unconscious and which is to be performed by professional medical staff.
1.6.2.6.3. Con: Releasing all domesticated animals into the wild would cause ecological shifts on a grand scale, and it would lead to two very possible scenarios: the animals would either get eaten \(by creatures not interested in pain-free killing\) or die of disease \(which we can treat in captivity\).
1.6.2.6.3.1. Con: Sounds similar to: 'If we free all the slaves they wont be able to survive and/or ruin the world' or 'If we allow women to vote the world is going to hell' or 'if we prevent corporations from polluting the environment the economy is going to suffer' . Every oppressive hierarchy makes similar claims to perpetuate itself.
1.6.2.6.3.1.1. Con: This issue is not against meat-eating, but against maltreatment of animals. If it is cruel to slaughter an animal for food, then it is just as cruel to let the animal be slaughtered by anything else, for example natural predators.
1.6.2.6.4. Pro: Any species that has a capacity to suffer and die has a right and interest to [avoid that suffering](https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1979----.htm). We violate these rights when we kill animals for food.
1.6.2.6.4.1. Con: Plants have a capacity of [suffering](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/plants-cannot-think-and-remember-but-theres-nothing-stupid-about-them-theyre-shockingly-sophisticated/) and an interest to [avoid it](https://www.wired.com/2013/12/secret-language-of-plants/). if we are to maintain this claim, we should refuse eating plants.
1.6.2.6.4.2. Pro: Slaughter makes animals [suffer](http://www.animal-ethics.org/journey-slaughterhouse/) from stress, fear and pain, for example during transport, and provokes corresponding resistance from them.
1.6.2.6.4.2.1. Con: Being chased by wolves or being slaughtered by a mountain lion or suffering from infection also causes stress, fear and pain.
1.6.2.6.4.3. Con: Suffering from diseases or being killed by predators in the wild is vastly greater suffering then being kept in a secure location, with the health of the animal monitored. Most animals have to be eaten by someone - humans would just take more care of the animal then it could care for itself in the wild, and the act of killing would be quicker/more humane then by a predator.
1.6.2.7. Pro: The fact that some people who are in the meat production business treat their animals poorly doesn't mean that they all do the same. Farmers mostly take excellent care of their livestock.
1.6.2.7.1. Con: Farmers generally don't pay attention to whether their animals will be maltreated in the butchery they sell it to.
1.6.3. Con: If you look at the animals in the world that are being farmed, their populations have never been higher. On a population level the species is surviving and thriving. Compare that to many protected species who, for all our conservation efforts, are dying off all over the world
1.6.3.1. Con: Many rainforest species [are dying](https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/deforestation) because their natural habitat is being cut down for animal husbandry.
1.6.3.2. Con: You must consider the quality of live vs the quantity of lives. It is surely better to have 200,000 healthy wild chickens than to have the 50,000,000,000 \(50 billion\) unhappy and short-lived chickens raised globally per year.
1.6.4. Con: It is not immoral to treat animals with some level of cruelty, as this is outweighed by the benefit of creating desirous food for humans.
1.6.4.1. Con: Cruelty cannot be outweighed by any benefit and should not exist in the first place.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: Cruelty will always be present since it is as subjective as it gets. One could argue that being alive is cruel. Eating wheat is cruel. No one can live a life without being cruel in someone else's eyes. It's always a matter of comparing pros/cons and minimizing pain in others.
1.6.5. Con: Eating meat of an animal which we didn't inflict any suffering on or cause its death cannot be ethically wrong \(if a predator killed it, or if it died by some other means\), since it is not cannibalism \(which is a separate moral issue\), and our digestive systems are adjusted to eating processed meat.
1.6.5.1. Con: Even a superficial look at the conditions farm animals have to endure \(especially in factory farms\) is enough to demolish all illusions about animals not suffering before ending on our plates
1.6.5.1.1. Con: This is an argument against mistreatment of animals, not against "eating meat". Farmers can take care of livestock pretty well, providing care and love their entire life. Mass-production is a separate issue which negatively impacts both vegetable and animal farming.
1.6.6. Pro: Killing animals is unethical.
1.6.6.1. Pro: Choosing not to kill animals for meat is a consistent logical extension to the moral values most of society already holds for humans. We don't think it's ok to kill a human to make a hamburger, and there are no traits that an animal has or lacks that if applied to a human would make us say its ok to kill that human for meat.
1.6.6.2. Pro: Eating meat is unethical because we must recognize a being has the rights of a nonhuman person who functions at least at the same level of complexity of a human that can't be aborted.
1.6.6.2.1. Con: Rights are granted by society. Animals do not have any natural rights except those granted to them by humans - and the rights they are granted give them the status of property, not equal to human beings.
1.6.6.2.1.1. Con: Many jurisdictions [do not treat](https://newrepublic.com/article/146870/law-recognizes-animals-people) animals as pure property anymore. Killing a cat is treated different from destroying a toaster.
1.6.6.2.2. Pro: If we recognize a fetus's right to life because it could survive outside the womb, we should recognize an animal's right to life.
1.6.6.2.2.1. Con: We may recognize a late fetus' right to life because it is human like ourselves. We are not logically required to grant similar rights to other species.
1.6.6.2.3. Con: It is unrealistic to expect humans to care as much about beings much different from themselves: the greater the differences, the harder it is to care. Thus, humans care more about primates than insects.
1.6.6.2.4. Con: That's not how nature works. Living beings - which includes both animals and humans - don't refrain from killing other animals just because they are on the same level of complexity.
1.6.6.2.5. Con: There is no compelling reason for humans to recognize rights of a being belonging to a species that is not able to reciprocate giving rights to humans.
1.6.6.2.5.1. Pro: It is rational for humans to recognize rights for all humans, as it is easy to determine who is human, and the large majority of humans can reciprocate.
1.6.6.2.5.2. Pro: No animals are capable of recognizing the concept of abstract rights.
1.6.6.2.5.3. Con: Animals need not be moral agents in order to have their inherent value \(from which their fundamental rights arise\) respected, [because they are moral patients](http://www.thevegetariansite.com/ethics_regan.htm).
1.6.6.3. Con: Killing animals for food is ethically acceptable.
1.6.6.3.1. Con: Killing animals wrong because a less ethically wrong alternative that involves killing - eating plants - is available.
1.6.6.3.1.1. Con: Saying that killing another living thing is inherently immoral leads to a very slippery slope. What immediately comes to mind is that in order to adopt vegetarian or vegan lifestyle you participate in depriving many plant based living things of their existence \(life\).
1.6.6.3.2. Con: An animal had to be killed in order for you to eat meat. According to the principle of equal consideration of interests, a trivial taste preference does not weigh up against the fundamental interest of an other animal to live.
1.6.6.3.2.1. Con: By that principle, even your interest to survive does not outweigh the animal's interest to survive, and, if plants can be said to have interests, this principle would also proscribe eating plants. This is clearly not a sustainable approach.
1.6.6.3.2.1.1. Con: We do need to eat plants to survive, and plants do not suffer as much as animals, so our interests outweigh the plant's survival.
1.6.6.3.2.1.2. Con: Humans can survive without meat, so the interest at play is really only the taste, which is clearly outweighed by survival interest of the animal.
1.6.6.3.2.2. Con: There are many animals we kill for trivial causes, for example insects and rats. Yet we usually do not consider killing a them as problematic as killing a cow.
1.6.6.3.2.3. Con: The principle of equal consideration of interests should only apply to humans.
1.6.6.3.2.3.1. Pro: Only humans are capable of reciprocating on the principle. Thus it offers no advantage for humans to unilaterally apply the principle to non-humans.
1.6.6.3.3. Pro: Many animals do not have the capacity to value life, and it is not wrong to deprive a thing something it does not value, thus it is not wrong to deprive an animal of a life it does not value.
1.6.6.3.3.1. Pro: Pro-survival behavior is not sufficient to be said to value one's life. Plants show pro-survival behavior when they release chemicals in response to being damaged, or change shape in response to changing light sources. But plants do not value their future.
1.6.6.3.3.2. Pro: To value your life means you value your future, but to value your future requires the capacity to conceptualize yourself in the future. But many animals do not have a self-concept \(self awareness\).
1.6.6.3.3.3. Con: Taking this argument to an extreme, it can be used to justify killing patients with severe cases of brain damage or dementia, since such patients might have also lost their capacity to value life.
1.6.6.3.4. Pro: Ethics was created by a branch of humanitarians to provide structure to the way humans consider, and interact with, the broader environment. Humans are a mammalian species \(an animal\) and hence can only answer to nature, not themselves. Treatment of other animals by humans is far less torrid than a lion ripping apart its prey.
1.6.6.3.5. Pro: If we stop raising animals for food and other animal products, most of the species will likely die out. Letting them die out is ethically worse than keeping them alive by breeding, feeding, killing and eating them.
1.6.6.3.5.1. Pro: Man has genetically modified many domesticated animals to the point where survival without human help is not possible.
1.6.6.3.5.1.1. Pro: Some breeds of cow are severely over-bred and have [problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748269/) with fertility.
1.6.6.3.5.1.2. Pro: Some horses bred for their features [suffer](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/12/outcry-over-extreme-bred-horse-that-looks-like-an-aardvark) from respiratory problems.
1.6.6.3.5.2. Con: Many domesticated species can survive in the wild, often by returning to a feral state.
1.6.6.3.5.2.1. Pro: [Feral pigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_pig), which are descended from domesticated pigs, live all over the world.
1.6.6.3.5.2.2. Con: If a separate sub-species devolves back to feral states, that technically eradicates the sub-species through natural selection.
1.6.6.3.5.2.3. Pro: Hawai'i is populated by [feral chickens](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/science/in-hawaii-chickens-gone-wild.html) that live in the wild.
1.6.6.3.5.2.4. Pro: Wild cattle live in different parts of the world. In [Hawai'i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_wild_cattle), descendants of cattle given as a present by a British officer still roam freely.
1.6.6.3.6. Pro: The ethical meaning of an act of killing is highly subjective and dependent on context. As George Bernard Shaw wrote, "when a man wants to murder a tiger, he calls it sport; when the tiger wants to murder him, he calls it ferocity".
1.6.6.3.7. Pro: Claiming that killing animals for food is ethically wrong would mean that life is a sort of sacred and/or metaphysically meaningful phenomenon that inherently deserves to be preserved. Science, however, suggest that complex life is nothing but simple biochemistry, leading to the assumption that life is not inherently valuable.
1.6.6.3.7.1. Con: Science does not tell the \(moral\) value of things. Whether life has value or not is not really the business of hard science, but rather the business of Philosophy.
1.6.6.3.7.2. Con: The life of animals matters, if to nobody else, at least to animals themselves. Their lives have an importance to them [that is apart from the utility they may have for humans.](http://regan.animalsvoice.com/the-animal-rights-position/)
1.6.6.3.8. Pro: Within an ethical framework that centers on purpose it would be considered ethical to eat meat. Religious frameworks consider that one of the Divinely intended purposes of animals, while naturalistic frameworks consider it the role or purpose of each element in an ecosystem to take its place in that ecosystem.
1.6.6.3.9. Con: If we agree that it should be unethical \(and immoral\) to cause needless suffering to other sentient beings, killing animals for food cannot be considered ethical \(or moral\) since for most people a well-balanced non-meat diet is as healthy as one based on meat.
1.6.6.4. Con: Meat production brings many more animals into existence than would otherwise exist - and existence with a cruel death is still better than never even having the chance to exist and enjoy life.
1.6.6.5. Pro: Animals are not property but living creatures. We do not own them and have no right to kill them for our own consumption.
1.6.6.5.1. Con: Then plants are alive, too. The same idea can be applied to every source of meals.
1.6.6.6. Con: Animals are being killed on a daily basis for a number of reasons, from scientific research to pest control. If the act of killing animals is not absolutely unethical by itself, as long as it provides some benefit for human society, then using meat as sustenance should not be strictly unethical as well.
1.6.6.7. Con: People who eat meat are not responsible for animal's death.
1.6.6.7.1. Pro: This logic is visible in Buddhism where the First Precept forbids the killing of any living being - yet the eating of animals that were not killed specifically to be eaten [is considered fine](https://www.thoughtco.com/buddhism-and-vegetarianism-449731).
1.6.6.7.1.1. Con: It is difficult to imagine how it is practical to only eat meat that comes from animals not killed to be eaten. Even Buddhist monks face this problem - and [are therefore](https://www.thoughtco.com/buddhism-and-vegetarianism-449731) usually vegetarian.
1.6.6.8. Con: -> See 1.4.4.5.
1.6.7. Pro: Eating meat is wrong because its production is wrong.
1.6.7.1. Pro: To eat meat we have to buy it. Buying food means supporting financially meat production.
1.6.7.1.1. Pro: In a free market, consumers' choices have influence on producers.
1.6.7.1.1.1. Con: If meat producers are doing something bad it's their responsibility. Consumers' choices don't justify immoral actions of seller.
1.6.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: Everyone is responsible only for their own actions.
1.6.7.1.1.1.2. Con: If someone who eats meat is aware of the unethical process of production, he is intentionally supporting it, which makes him partially responsible.
1.6.7.1.2. Con: It is possible to eat meat that hadn't been bought from unethical production.
1.6.7.1.3. Con: To eat meat we have to have it. Buying is not the only method of acquiring it - we could make the meat ourselves from our own animals, or receive it from a family member or friend, free of charge \(or in exchange for another service\).
1.6.7.2. Con: Eating and producing meat are two different actions that should be evaluated separately.
1.6.7.2.1. Pro: Someone who eats meat has no influence on how someone else produces it.
1.6.7.2.2. Pro: Thought experiment: Imagine that someone produces brushes made of human hair - and he is killing people to get their hair. We can truly say that production of brushes is wrong. But we wouldn't say that painting with these brushes is wrong.
1.6.8. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.6.4.
1.6.9. Pro: Most animal farming in the West is factory farming, where animals live in confined spaces and aren't treated well. As of 2005, this share stood at 40% of the global meat production \([Worldwatch, p. 5](http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/WP171.pdf)\).
1.6.10. Con: Animals get mistreated even without us eating meat. To not eat meat is therefore hardly a solution.
1.6.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.8.3.1.3.
1.6.10.2. Pro: The production of eggs routinely involves the [culling of chicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_culling) that are not useful. In the US alone, [about 260 Million](http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/farm/welfare_egg.pdf) animals are killed this way every year.
1.7. Con: It is equally ethical to eat animals as it is to eat plants.
1.7.1. Con: To conflate animals and plants is fallacious. The difference between the two is too significant as to not have an impact on the moral treatment that ought to be given to each.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Other animals are much more similar to humans than they are to plants. Also, the first are biologically much more complex than the latter, which is generally directly related to psychological complexity \(e.g., the lesser or greater ability to feel pain and pleasure, to conceive one's self as an individual, etc.\).
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: The vulnerability to a greater number of diseases and malfunctions of animals, compared to plants, are evidence of the superior level of complexity of the former.
1.7.1.1.2. Pro: Humans, who we know are generally very complex biological and psychological beings, [only differ from animals in degree, not in nature](http://regan.animalsvoice.com/the-philosophy-of-animal-rights/).
1.7.1.1.2.1. Pro: Grief is a secondary emotion which requires the ability to make a connection between feelings and actions. Animals are able to experience [grief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_grief).
1.7.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: For example, this orca [grieved](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/13/orca-mother-finally-abandons-dead-calf-she-carried-for-more-than-two-weeks) the loss of her calf for weeks, abandoning it when it started to decompose.
1.7.1.1.3. Con: The purpose of nutrition is providing energy for the functioning of the organism, and building blocks for replenishing its own tissue structures. From this aspect, animals are actually more convenient as a food source, since they possess all the bio-molecules that humans \(being also animals\) require.
1.7.1.1.4. Con: Biological complexity does correlate with psychological complexity, but we cannot claim that the correlation is linear. Also, the line we would draw between animals which are conscious enough to suffer in meat production and those who wouldn't would be arbitrary and uncertain.
1.7.1.1.4.1. Con: Arbitrary lines already exist in most laws. The age of consent, for instance, is "arbitrary," but we recognize that one should nonetheless still exist.
1.7.1.2. Con: Plants, even fruits, may also [feel suffering](https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/botany/plants-feel-pain.htm). They are just unable to show it.
1.7.1.2.1. Con: [Plants do not feel pain](https://mercyforanimals.org/heres-why-youre-wrong-when-you-say-plants). They react to stimuli. There is nothing about any of these studies which suggests that these observations should be considered analogous to what we were consider pain or suffering. Plants are not conscious.
1.7.1.3. Con: Just because two things are different in complexity or structure, doesn't mean they should have different moral values assigned to them. Moral values are arbitrary and there are no objective means of telling anyone how to assign them.
1.7.1.3.1. Con: This argument is absurd: it extends to equate violence against a human being and violence against a nice chesterfield as requiring the same moral value. The properties of what is being acted on are not irrelevant to forming a moral value, they constitute part of the moral value.
1.7.1.4. Con: The differences between animals and humans are by no means clear. Some organisms that we routinely eat don't even fit either category, for example mushrooms and yeasts that are commonly classified as a kingdom of their own: fungi.
1.7.2. Pro: Both plants and animals are made from organic molecules, which humans \(and other animals\) require in order to survive, and there are no alternative sources. Hence, both present sources of nutrition, and only the specific nutritional needs of a species determine which of the two should be eaten by whom.
1.7.3. Con: Plants lack a central nervous system and lack sentience. Animals, however, like us humans, are sentient and have a central nervous system. Saying that picking a carrot and chopping it is ethically the same as grabbing an animal and slitting their throat is absurd.
1.7.4. Con: Eating a meat-based diet is less ethical than eating a plant-based diet because the former harms both animals and plants, whereas the latter only harms plants.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Most of the plants we grow, especially in the form of [GMO mono-crops,](https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/land-use/soy) are fed to animals. If we ceased animal agriculture we could stop growing those plants and breeding those animals, therefore preventing the suffering of countless generations of future 'food creatures'.
1.8. Con: A lot of animals are born and given a chance to live because of the meat industry. They also get all the food and water they want for them to be healthy. They might die sooner than normal, but at least it's a quick death and they get to live the best part of their lives.
1.8.1. Pro: Many animals are farmed in far better conditions than worst case scenario. This includes grass coop with access to sunlight and antibiotics and hormone-free growth.
1.8.2. Con: Unless we are also prepared to accept that another species farming humans for meat is a good thing, using this line of reasoning is hypocritical.
1.8.3. Con: If an individual of any species is "given the chance" and it is raised in a 2 square meter jail for its whole life, that means its own habits in a natural space won't ever be accomplished, so they don't get to live the best part of their lives at all.
1.8.3.1. Con: Nature is equally cruel, probably even crueler: a "normal death" by predators is incredibly cruel and gruesome \(e.g. a predator enhances predatory skills by playing with the wounded victim\).
1.8.3.2. Con: Death by an overload of parasites or an infection is an incredibly slow and cruel death. These can be regulated only by human supervision.
1.8.4. Con: Being born is not a necessary good, especially when it is followed by a whole life lived in small cages with hardly any space to move. The argument makes the conditions created for the animals by the meat industry sound like a holiday resort for animals.
1.9. Pro: Eating meat is illogical.
1.9.1. Pro: Humans' and animals' essential traits do not differ. Both have consciousness and are sentient. So, if eating humans is wrong, eating animals is wrong as well.
1.9.1.1. Con: Sentience, consciousness and the capacity for pain and suffering are not proper reasons for disallowing the killing of a species.
1.9.1.2. Con: It is rational for human beings to disallow killing of anyone who is a human being, since the vast majority of humans can reciprocate, thus making all humans safer. Introducing exceptions for the small proportions of humans incapable of reciprocating would offer no major benefit, but would introduce an uncertainty among all humans as to whether their rights would be respected.
1.9.1.3. Con: [Humans are fundamentally different from other animals.](https://www.kialo.com/humans-are-fundamentally-different-from-other-animals-9265/9265.0=9265.1/=9265.1)
1.9.1.4. Con: It is wrong to eat other humans because they are the same species, not because of any inherent trait possessed by the species.
1.9.2. Pro: There is no rational basis for the separation between "food-animals" and "pet-animals", therefore, if it is wrong to eat pet-animals, it should also be wrong to eat "food-animals".
1.9.2.1. Pro: The fact that animals that are considered pets in one culture can be food in another culture only emphasizes that there is no universal way of distinguishing between pet and food animals.
1.9.2.2. Con: It is not wrong to eat pet-animals, in some cases in the rural areas a cow or a chicken can be a pet, they are not born "pets" they are animals, just like fish that someone wants as a pet.
1.9.2.3. Con: "Pet" and "Food" animals vary massively across the world, with large overlaps between different cultures. It is personal choice which meat you could choose to eat, making this less relevant to the larger question. This statement could be equally rephrased as "if it is right to eat "food animals" then it should also be right to eat "pet animals"" depending on the viewers standpoint.
1.9.2.4. Con: In Western countries dogs are considered pets, but in regions of Africa and Asia they are bred for food, [for example in Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nureongi).
1.9.2.5. Con: A pet is just an animal we make use of in a different way. It is therefore not inherently different from a "food animal" and we cannot infer that the treatment of either is wrong.
1.9.2.6. Con: Conversely, it should be ok to eat "pet-animals" there are many that get put down every day and from a pragmatic perspective is a waste of food.
1.9.2.7. Con: ''Pet'' animals are, largely, predators. Predators have a lower quality of meat \(it is filled with urea, which their blood has a large concentration of\), plus are more valuable to their owners alive \(cats hunt mice, dogs guard the home, etc\). ''Food'' animals are tastier and more healthy to eat.
1.9.2.7.1. Con: This is untrue for rabbits, rats, guinea pigs, fish, etc. In general, these animals are also not eaten when they have been kept at home, so the reason they are not being eaten is not that their meat has urea in it.
1.9.2.8. Con: The fact that something is ok to do in general doesn't mean that there are no special cases where the ethics is different. For instance, having sex is ethically ok - having sex with someone else's partner or with family members isn't. By the same logic, under the blanket term of ''eating meat'' we can have animals which are not to be eaten \(highly sentient ones and pets\).
1.9.2.9. Con: Intelligence, awaraness and sensitivity to pain of a pet animal is much higher than the prey animal. For instance, a fish has much less awaraness and pain sensitivity than a Golden Retriewer domestic dog. Therefore it makes no sense to eat a pet animal which is intelligent as a small human, when you have alternatives like fish and chicken.
1.9.2.9.1. Con: Most farm animals are [smarter or comparable to dogs](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/farm-animals-that-are-probably-smarter-than-your-dog/)
1.9.2.9.1.1. Pro: Pigs, one of the animals farmed most widely, are [more intelligent](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animal-emotions/201506/pigs-are-intelligent-emotional-and-cognitively-complex) than dogs, have more complex mental abilities, and more emotional capabilities.
1.9.2.9.2. Con: -> See 1.9.2.9.1.1.
1.9.2.9.3. Con: The difference between a pet an animal raised on a farm is not a matter of the animal's intelligence. The difference turns on how we view the animal. On farms, even children are taught not to name the animals. If they did, they wouldn't want to eat it. In countries where people eat dogs, they do not raise and name the dogs they eat. They don't see dogs as "pets".
1.9.2.10. Con: this assumes that eating "pet-animals" is wrong, therefore eating "food-animals" is wrong too. Whether eating "pet-animals" is wrong is a separate question, which pretty much hinges on the main question "Is eating meat ethically wrong?", as such it cannot be used to support the first statement. 

That is, if we decide that eating meet is etchically ok, then eating pet-animals is also ok, and this point falls apart.
1.9.3. Con: There are plenty of things that are considered ethically wrong even though this doesn't necessarily make much logical sense.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Cleaning toilets with national flags, eating pets and using animal carcasses for masturbation - plenty of things that cause no harm are seen as ethically wrong, apparently for no good rational but [emotional and cultural reasons](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.385.1825&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
1.9.3.1.1. Con: Seeing the examples in the parent as morally wrong have a sensible rationale behind them. When individuals go off social norms in such acute ways, other people have good reasons to consider them unstable and potentially dangerous.
1.9.4. Con: All self-replenishing systems require material for the renewal of their internal structures. Being animals, we too are made of ''meat''. Hence, meat provides those materials we need for self-replenishing.
1.9.4.1. Con: These materials for renewal could also be supplied by other means. We are made of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. These are all contained within plants, so we might as well eat plants.
1.9.5. Con: If eating meat violated any logical laws, the evolution would not have produced any meat-eating predators.
1.10. Con: About half of the world's farm land is pasture land, which is [not suited](http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5304e/x5304e03.htm) for growing crops, and ideally used for grazing animals.
1.10.1. Pro: To optimise the amount of food produced, using land to graze animals makes sense if the land would not support crops.
1.10.2. Con: Vast amounts of farmland are utilized to grow the grain that is then used to feed commercially farmed animals. The energy conversion rate from grain to this meat is low meaning that without the meat industry a large amount of agricultural land would become available for crop growth for human consumption.
1.10.2.1. Con: This claim demonstrates no necessity in the use of farmed feed for animals, it simply demonstrates feed is used for some animals. Therefore it does not counter the argument animals can be grazed in natural grasslands without significantly damaging it's ecosystem.
1.10.2.2. Con: Energy is not the only thing we want from food. There are many other nutrients that exist in varying quantities in different foods. Meat has nutrients that require special care to obtain from non meat foods.
1.10.2.3. Con: The world is running out of fresh water resources. Much of the world is naturally grassland. Humans can't eat grass and can't get much nutrition from crops that don't need irrigation \(such as wheat\). Grazing animals can live off grass \(which needs no irrigation\), whereas crops grown for direct human consumption require irrigation, and the amount of irrigation they are using for this, is not sustainable. Thus in much of the world animal farming is more sustainable than crop farming.
1.10.3. Con: Pasture can be used to support animals \(i.e. cows\) that can give dairy and work and would therefore contribute to human society without having to be slaughtered.
1.10.4. Con: Pasture land is not necessary for a vegetarian diet and could be rewilded, providing desperately needed space for plummeting wildlife.
1.10.5. Pro: Land used for raising animals cannot necessarily be converted to raise crops without significantly increasing the economic and environmental cost, i.e., mass of food per acre per year per volume of water is a few orders of magnitude lower for crops than animals in some areas.
1.10.6. Con: Grazing animals typically [contribute](https://climatenexus.org/climate-issues/food/grazing-cattle-climate-change/) to climate change through the release of methane into the atmosphere.
1.11. Con: No major religion outright prohibits the eating of meat, even if restrictions are stipulated.
1.11.1. Pro: Placing a restriction on only a limited subset \(of species, methods, and the like\) is actually a clear indication that these scriptures reject the assertion that eating animals is intrinsically wrong.
1.11.1.1. Con: For the purpose of gradually aligning followers with the principle of non-violence, scriptures may use restrictions as stepping stones. Tolerance, sanction and encouragement are not the same.
1.11.2. Pro: The Christian Bible states that man has dominion over animals \(Genesis\) and that all animals are under man's power.
1.11.2.1. Con: Genesis 1:29 explicitly states that seed-bearing plants and trees with fruits should be used for food. Nothing about eating beasts.
1.11.2.1.1. Con: Meat was added to the menu in [Genesis 9:2-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+9%3A2-3&version=NLT).
1.11.2.2. Con: There is also passages which give man dominion over women in the bible. And others that justify slavery. If you don't also accept these than it is fallacious to use the bible to grant dominion over animals.
1.11.3. Pro: Jewish dietary restrictions have [absolutely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashrut#Permitted_and_forbidden_animals) [nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashrut#Kosher_slaughter) [to do](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/113425/jewish/What-Is-Kosher.htm) with aversion to consuming meat, on moral grounds or otherwise.
1.11.3.1. Con: [Several commandments demonstrate concern for the physical or psychological suffering of animals. We may not plow a field using animals of different species \(Deut. 22:10\), because this would be a hardship to the animals ... of this law.](http://www.jewfaq.org/animals.htm)
1.11.4. Pro: There is [no clear requirement](https://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/dharmadata/fdd21.htm) to be vegetarian in Buddhism. The Buddha ate meat, and so do many devout Buddhists.
1.11.4.1. Pro: While the First Precept of Buddhism forbids the taking of life, this is [usually interpreted](https://www.theosophical.org/publications/quest-magazine/2901) as intentional killing, and as not applicable to eating meat \(as it does not involve intentional killing\).
1.11.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.
1.11.4.3. Con: This is a matter of interpretation. The Dhammapada, a collection of sayings by the Buddha, has also [been interpreted](http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/veg/006-animalright-dhammapada.htm) as clearly speaking out against the eating of meat.
1.11.5. Con: ISKCON, aka the Hare Krishnas, which is a recognized form of Hinduism, [prohibits its practitioners from eating meat, fish or egg.](http://www.krishna.com/four-regulative-principles)
1.11.6. Con: Religion is not, in an of itself, a suitable foundation on which to construct ethical stances.
1.11.6.1. Con: It has been for millennia. Whether it should or not is for another debate.
1.11.6.2. Pro: Religion has always been a means of conveying morality and never an absolute morality in and of itself.
1.12. Pro: Eating meat exacerbates global problems.
1.12.1. Pro: Mass meat production is bad for the environment.
1.12.1.1. Con: Some forms of meat production could be neutral or good for the environment.
1.12.1.1.1. Pro: Eating surplus populations of wild animals can take pressure off the environment, as is the case for Australia's over-population of [wild kangaroos](http://www.greenlifestylemag.com.au/node/409/full).
1.12.1.1.1.1. Con: Wildlife overpopulation is mainly due to human interventions.
1.12.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Rabbits overpulation in Australia is due to the importation of 150 bunnies in 1788](http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2009/04/08/2538860.htm).
1.12.1.1.2. Pro: Some animals [like lamb](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/lamb-most-ethical-meat-eat-buy-farming-why-organic-chicken-beef-pork-daylesford-a7979251.html) are usually grazed on land that has little other use and fed little but grass.
1.12.1.1.2.1. Con: Those areas could usually be forested. Forest area isn't usually seen as a very economical use, but it is [one of the best ways to decrease CO2 from the air](https://www.zmescience.com/science/carbon-storage-forests-153412442/) and may also [help threatened species and thus slow down or stagnate the rapid decline of bio-diversity](http://wwf.panda.org/our_work/wildlife/problems/habitat_loss_degradation/).
1.12.1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.10.6.
1.12.1.2. Con: A vegetarian lifestyle, too, relies on farming practices that damage nature and hurt animals.
1.12.1.2.1. Con: Farming plants is less damaging to the environment than farming animals. It also uses less land, meaning more can be used for nature reserves/wild land.
1.12.1.2.1.1. Con: The use of [genetically modified plants and herbicides](https://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/press_releases/foee_5_environmental_impacts_glyphosate.pdf) in crop farming has a hugely negative impact on the environment.
1.12.1.2.1.2. Con: Many companies user dangerous and harmful [chemicals](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/09/monsanto-continued-selling-pcbs-for-years-despite-knowing-health-risks-archives-reveal) to prevent weeds from infesting their fields.
1.12.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Regulations can prevent companies from using dangerous chemicals.
1.12.1.2.1.3. Con: Jungles are deforested and indigenous people displaced to free land up for farming [soy](https://www.worldwildlife.org/industries/soy) beans.
1.12.1.2.2. Con: We have to feed ourselves in order to survive. Agriculture is the only way to keep all of us alive, but it's [not](https://inhabitat.com/infographic-the-true-environmental-cost-of-eating-meat/) the same to get resources from the animals as to get them from crops.
1.12.1.3. Pro: Transitioning to a predominantly plant based diet will enable a reduction in the intensity of farming practices, reducing pollution and chemical use.
1.12.1.3.1. Con: Quite the opposite, if people stops eating meat wich is about 283'000.000 kg/year there would have to be enough meat-alternatives at the same price, that means a rising in the industrial farming activity wich uses a lot of chemicals.
1.12.1.4. Pro: [A new analysis](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth) shows that while meat and dairy provide just 18% of calories and 37% of protein, it uses the vast majority – 83% – of farmland and produces 60% of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions.
1.12.1.4.1. Pro: Raising farm animals is a waste of resources that could more efficiently be used to tackle world hunger. It is estimated that for 2014-16, [10.9%](https://www.worldhunger.org/2015-world-hunger-and-poverty-facts-and-statistics/#produce1) of the planet's population was undernourished. If 2000 kcal of cow meat can sustain a person for a day, the 20000 kcal of corn used to produce that proportion of beef [can sustain several people](http://www.worldwatch.org/node/549).
1.12.1.4.1.1. Con: Caloric consumption is [not the metric](http://www.nutrisavings.com/calories-vs-nutrition/) we should use to measure sustainability of life. If it were the case then 2000 calories of cake would be as effective as 2000 calories of corn.
1.12.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The resources used to produce monocultures, such as corn, that go to feed farm animals, can be used to produce a diversity of crops, besides corn, that can provide the necessary nutrition to humans.
1.12.1.4.1.1.2. Con: Corn, although not containing all of the necessary nutrients to humans, seems to be [quite nutritious itself](https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5687/2).
1.12.1.5. Con: A large proportion of fertilizer is produced by mass animal farming, this is used to grow plants, which is good for the environment.
1.12.1.5.1. Con: Factory farming, like the pork production industry in [North Carolina](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/20/north-carolina-hog-industry-pig-farms), produce many million tons more feces than can be used as fertilizer.
1.12.1.5.1.1. Con: The waste produced and partly sprayed on fields in that area have caused health problems for the people living in in the area, and breed pests like insects, directly causing a diminishing of quality of life.
1.12.1.5.2. Pro: Some US farmers are participating in a grassroots program of "[manure share](https://modernfarmer.com/2014/08/manure-usa/)", which connects them to local gardeners who need manure.
1.12.1.5.3. Pro: Livestock grazing has the potential to improve the fertility of the ground through manure, thus enabling crops to grow.
1.12.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.12.1.4.1.
1.12.1.7. Con: Not all meat comes from mass production.
1.12.1.8. Con: We generally accept some degree of environmental harm if this allows for a great deal of pleasure. For many people, eating meat is a source of pleasure.
1.12.1.8.1. Pro: The majority of people really likes the taste of meat.
1.12.1.8.1.1. Con: There is no humane way to kill a being that wants to live, just so you can enjoy a few moments of taste pleasure.
1.12.1.8.1.2. Con: Just because someone likes the taste of meat doesn't mean that this person inevitably needs to eat meat. Alternatives that imitate meat are available and becoming more popular.
1.12.1.8.1.2.1. Pro: [Jackfruit](http://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2018-01-02/jackfruit-finding-niche-as-meat-alternative/9254528) is getting popular and being used as a substitute for meats like pulled pork, as it is similar in texture and can be seasoned to taste the same.
1.12.1.8.1.2.2. Pro: Meat alternatives are [increasingly popular](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/food-blog/2014/oct/15/vegan-vegetarian-diet-beef-fishless-filets-meat-substitutes-rise). 36% of US-Americans purchase meat substitute products.
1.12.1.8.1.2.2.1. Pro: The companies producing meat substitutes are aiming to gain meat eaters as their customers, so it's in their interest to make these products as tasty and similar to meat as possible.
1.12.1.8.1.2.2.2. Con: The claim implies that a vast majority of US-Americans don't purchase meat substitute products.
1.12.1.8.1.2.2.3. Con: Only 7% of respondents in [this survey](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/food-blog/2014/oct/15/vegan-vegetarian-diet-beef-fishless-filets-meat-substitutes-rise) identify as vegetarians. The 36% who buy meat alternatives therefore probably see them as additions to their existing, non-vegetarian diet. We cannot tell whether they consider them as a means to truly replace the meat they eat.
1.12.1.8.1.2.3. Con: Despite an abundance of vegetarian alternatives, meat dishes remain the most popular and commercially successful.
1.12.1.8.1.3. Con: Something causing a good feeling in someone is not a viable criterion for considering something morally acceptable.
1.12.1.8.1.3.1. Pro: Human flesh may have tasted good to cannibals, yet cannibalism has been, and still is, overwhelmingly regarded as highly immoral.
1.12.1.8.1.3.2. Pro: This is especially true if the behavior justified thereby involves violence and suffering
1.12.1.8.1.3.3. Pro: For a murderer to like what he is doing, for instance, does not justify his actions.
1.12.1.8.1.3.4. Con: Many types of utilitarianism argue that anything that increases the sum total of pleasure in the world should be considered morally good.
1.12.1.8.1.4. Pro: The vast majority choose to eat at least some meat at least sometimes, if they have the opportunity.
1.12.1.8.2. Pro: Cruise ships produce [tremendous pollution](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/21/the-worlds-largest-cruise-ship-and-its-supersized-pollution-problem), yet there is little opposition to them and their growing popularity. The number of worldwide passengers [doubled within ten years](https://transportgeography.org/?page_id=7067).
1.12.1.9. Con: All mass production is bad for both the environment and the economy. The problems of mass-production are not unique for the case of meat.
1.12.1.10. Pro: Eating and producing meat contributes to climate change.
1.12.1.10.1. Pro: Livestock production is responsible for [about 15%](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/) of all human-made greenhouse gas emissions. This is a higher share than the [transportation sector](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data#Sector).
1.12.1.10.1.1. Con: We could eat less meat or find other ways to produce it; more sustainable and ethical.
1.12.1.10.1.2. Con: In a world without meat production, there would still be livestock. We wouldn't eat them, but we wouldn't kill them either.
1.12.1.10.1.2.1. Pro: There are various other purposes for which livestock exists: to produce eggs, milk, leather, wool, etc.
1.12.1.10.2. Pro: The world's top 20 meat and dairy companies emit [more greenhouse gases](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/07/big-meat-big-dairy-carbon-emmissions-exxon-mobil) per year than does a major industrialized nation than Germany.
1.12.1.10.3. Con: Moving to a vegetarian diet would help in the short run, before our human population grew so much that even that wasn't enough. We need to accept that humans are the problem. Our population growth and the careless use of available resources is the problem, not merely meat consumption
1.12.1.10.3.1. Con: Even though the switch to a vegetarian diet may not be able to completely offset humanity's growth, it would at least reduce total meat demand and its growth, thereby improving on the current trajectory of things.
1.12.1.10.4. Con: Meat can be eaten and produced without it contributing to climate change.
1.12.1.11. Pro: Reduction in mass meat farming may also reduce the industrial use of antibiotics in the farming industry- this would help to limit the development of antibiotic resistance.
1.12.2. Con: Global problems include war, poverty, illiteracy, disease. There is no clear connection between eating meat and any of those.
1.12.3. Pro: The production of meat [reduces the global availability of food](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034015/meta) as much of it is fed to life-stock. Meat production therefore contributes to world hunger.
1.12.3.1. Con: [Food waste](https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/food_waste_en) is a bigger problem than meat production.
1.12.3.1.1. Pro: Cutting meat from menus and from people's diets quite possibly wouldn't help resolving this issue. The solution lays in different areas, such as food re-distribution and less food waste.
1.12.3.2. Con: Malnourishment in less-economically-developed-countries is mostly down to unequal distribution of wealth, which shows us that a mere presence of more nutrition to go around wouldn’t fix world hunger. The root of world hunger lies in greed, not meat-eating.
1.12.4. Pro: -> See 1.12.1.10.
1.12.5. Con: Many global problems aren't a result of humans eating meat, but rather of the size of the human population and its continuing growth.
1.12.5.1. Con: The size of the human population is hardly controllable. In contrast to that, eating meat is a decision that is relatively easy to make and would have a positive impact.
1.13. Con: Not eating meat would harm the economy.
1.13.1. Con: The economy can adapt, like it always has after big morally-oriented changes \(like slavery or some wars, for instance\). We shouldn't look at society only through the prism of economics.
1.13.1.1. Pro: In the United States, a very powerful pro-slavery argument was based on its [importance for the economy](https://ctlsites.uga.edu/hist2111-wolf2015/2015/11/30/pro-slavery-ideologies/) of the country. Yet, eventually, it was not powerful enough vis-a-vis the human right to freedom.
1.13.2. Con: The "economy" is not a supreme value and does not override the fundamental rights that animals have.
1.13.3. Con: Rather the opposite: Growing plants is cheaper than producing meat.
1.13.3.1. Con: If growing plants is cheaper than producing meat, this means that less money is moved around by this process, thereby leading to less economic activity.
1.13.3.2. Pro: Producing meat is much more [water-intensive](https://phys.org/news/2011-01-footprints-animal-proteins.html) than growing plants.
1.13.4. Pro: People would lose their jobs.
1.13.4.1. Pro: A lot of people depend on the meat industry to earn their living, this cannot simply be exchanged by the "plant" industry. For example, [about 800,000 people](http://www.themarketworks.org/stats) work in the meat packing and processing industry in the US.
1.13.4.1.1. Con: The evolution to a plant-based society wouldn't happen over night; and as demand  for plant-based alternatives increases so will more jobs in this area emerge.
1.13.4.2. Con: Nobody grows up dreaming of working at a slaughterhouse. Most workers in this industry are [from socio-economically weak backgrounds](http://www.foodispower.org/slaughterhouse-workers/) and have probably few alternatives.
1.13.4.2.1. Con: Cutting the list of job alternatives for people with few decent alternatives is not an ethically good thing to do.
1.13.4.3. Con: The argument that people might lose their jobs was never a good starting point for societal progress.
1.14. Con: Humans have eaten meat for thousands of years, so it is a long-standing tradition.
1.14.1. Con: Tradition doesn't justify cruelty.
1.14.2. Con: Just because something is a long standing tradition doesn't mean it is intrinsically right. Although it can tell us what is acceptable to a given society or a portion of its people, it is not necessarily a certificate of morality for a specific practice.
1.14.2.1. Pro: Many long standing traditions such as female genital mutilation deserve to be forgotten.
1.14.3. Con: Traditions are not always accepted by the majority of members of a given society. The [decreasing popularity](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/opinion/sunday/spains-bullfighting-fight.html) of bullfighting in Spain is an example of how traditions can be contested and abandoned by people even where they seem to have deep roots.
1.14.4. Con: We only eat meat because of the taste and our food culture. We don't need to do it because we can get our nutrition from other sources. Eating meat is therefore purely a personal preference.
1.14.4.1. Con: There are plenty of vegan testimonies that imply a lesser quality of life or downright life-threatening health problems on a strict vegan diet. There are also vegan success stories, but that only implies that the problem of nutrition is much more complicated than just ''personal preference''.
1.14.5. Pro: Eating meat lies at the core of many of the world's culinary cultures, for example in France and Argentina.
1.15. Con: -> See 1.12.1.8.1.
1.16. Pro: Modern meat production is harmful and immoral, and therefore eating meat is ethically wrong.
1.16.1. Pro: The production of meat generally includes harmful working conditions.
1.16.1.1. Pro: Slaughterhouse workers suffer too from [an exhausting and brutal labor.](http://www.animalsaustralia.org/issues/slaughterhouse-cruelty-human-factor.php)
1.16.1.1.1. Con: In this, not meat production as such is harmful to humans but the conditions under which meat is produced in slaughterhouses. These conditions can change.
1.16.1.2. Con: Agriculture has a long history of [child abuse](http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/Agriculture/lang--en/index.htm), [worker exploitation](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/aug/03/hungry-poor-exploited-alarm-over-australias-import-of-farm-workers) and [human trafficking](http://www.coha.org/the-ongoing-human-trafficking-and-farm-labor-crisis/), mostly on crop farms. This needs to be faced before veganism is a viable option.
1.16.1.2.1. Con: Eating meat won't help solve those problems, as the beasts we eat still have to be fed, which actually means more agriculture. Also, we can face many problems at once in a world where there are many problems to solve.
1.16.1.2.2. Con: Human rights abuses also occur in the raising of cattle for meat. Contemporary slavery on Brazilian cattle farms is [an example of such abuses](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/26/americas/brazil-amazon-slavery-freedom-project/index.html).
1.16.1.2.3. Pro: [Many American undocumented immigrants](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/27/where-americas-undocumented-immigrants-work/?utm_term=.19cb704482c4) work in agriculture for very low wages in poor working conditions.
1.16.1.3. Con: The suffering of workers is not only a reality in the food-processing industry, but also in other industries, for example in the production of clothing. Following this argument, we can use hardly any man-made products anymore.
1.16.1.4. Pro: Factory farming happens in rural areas and disproportionately affects minority communities, who are subsequently exposed to pollutants. This is called [environmental racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_racism).
1.16.1.4.1. Pro: For example, hog farming corporations in [North Carolina](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/20/north-carolina-hog-industry-pig-farms)spray fields near settlements, causing health issues, a drop in home and land value, and pollution of natural resources.
1.16.1.5. Con: The benefits to humans outweigh these harms.
1.16.1.6. Con: The harm to humans can be reduced, theoretically to zero, for example by improving the conditions under which meat is produced. Therefore, the harm cannot be used to argue that eating meat is immoral in principle.
1.16.1.6.1. Pro: Meat production tends to become more and more automated, already reducing the number of affected humans to minimum and potentially excluding their involvement whatsoever.
1.16.2. Pro: -> See 1.12.1.
1.16.3. Con: The morality of meat production does affect not the morality of eating that meat.
1.16.3.1. Con: It does imply that engaging in behavior which encourages more production of meat is bad, though. So, while it might allow for eating meat that is going to be wasted otherwise, it does not allow for purchasing meat if that purchase signals to producers they should continue to produce meat \(as is the case with most purchases of meat, and thus most meat consumption\).
1.16.3.1.1. Con: The fact that someone receives "a signal" to perform an action doesn't make the signal's sender responsible for this action.
1.16.3.1.2. Con: Almost all of meat that wouldn't be bought would be wasted otherwise. Thus if it allows for eating meat that is going to be wasted, it allows for eating and purchasing almost all meat.
1.16.3.2. Pro: If the conditions of meat production were the primary reason not to eat meat, eating game meat \(wild, hunted animals\) would be fine. So that would imply it's not categorically wrong to eat meat; it's wrong to produce it under bad conditions.
1.16.4. Con: This only suggest than eating meet "irresponsibly" is immoral. One can opt for meat from sources that are verified to treat animals in a responsible way
1.16.4.1. Pro: In most places, free-range meat is available which comes from animals that are allowed to roam freely outside for at least part of the day.
1.16.4.1.1. Con: Free-range is a label to make the consumer feel good about their decisions, it has little to do with [animal welfare](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/free-range-organic-meat-myths/).
1.16.4.2. Con: All animals regardless of being from factory farms or free range go to the same slaughterhouses.
