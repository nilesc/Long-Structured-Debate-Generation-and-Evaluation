Discussion Title: Should the US Pay Reparations for Slavery?

1. The US should pay reparations for slavery.
1.1. Con: Public opinion [polls](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reparations-black-americans-slavery_us_56c4dfa9e4b08ffac1276bd7) indicate that a majority of Americans oppose paying reparations to descendants of slaves.
1.1.1. Con: The majority of the population does not understand the issue at hand correctly.
1.1.1.1. Pro: [Polls indicate](http://www.gallup.com/poll/4435/public-overestimates-us-black-hispanic-populations.aspx) that Americans are fundamentally misinformed about the basics of race relations in the United States, for example by over-estimating the share of Black Americans among the country's population by a factor of 2.5 \(with estimates of over 30% instead of the actual 13%\).
1.1.1.2. Pro: A majority of white Americans - who still constitute over 70% of the US population - perceive discrimination based on race and through institutions and practices as [far less](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/on-views-of-race-and-inequality-blacks-and-whites-are-worlds-apart/) or [not at all](https://today.yougov.com/news/2014/06/02/reparations/) an impediment for Black Americans.
1.1.1.3. Pro: [About half](http://ropercenter.cornell.edu/12810-2/) of all Americans disagree with the idea that slavery was among the factors that created conditions under which it is difficult for Black Americans to work their way out of the lower class.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Public misconception and ignorance about issues relating to slavery persists. Four out of ten Americans, for example, believe that slavery was not the root cause of the Civil War \([McClatchy-Marist. p.1](http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/misc/usapolls/us150722/CivilWar/McClatchy-Marist%20Poll_National%20Release%20and%20Tables_The%20Confederate%20Flag_August%202015.pdf)\).
1.1.1.4.1. Con: The war was initially fought to maintain the union, not eliminate slavery.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Even if that is true, eliminating slavery was the outcome, and many lives were lost in pursuit of it.
1.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The distinction is still a relevant one. If ending slavery was not the original intent of the war, nor the reason it was continued, then the lives lost cannot be considered moral reparations for the harm done to Black Americans.
1.1.1.4.1.2. Con: While slavery was not the immediate cause of the war, the dispute about slavery's future was the cause of secession. Without the previous intent to stop the further expansion of slavery, the war would thus not have broken out.
1.1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Slavery was at the core of the disagreement between representatives of the South and North in Congress \([Aldrich, p. 131](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=vd4xs121zoQC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.1.1.4.1.2.2. Pro: As historians [argue](http://www.asjournal.org/53-2009/abraham-lincolns-attitudes-on-slavery-and-race/), the "central question that finally tore the nation apart was the institution of slavery with its ramification in politics, economy and culture."
1.1.1.4.1.3. Pro: The freeing of slaves through the emancipation proclamation was a [strategic move](http://www.historynet.com/emancipation-proclamation), aimed at making it impossible for the British or the French to back the South, rather than a conscious effort to help slaves.
1.1.1.4.1.3.1. Con: Even if the emancipation proclamation was a strategic move, it fit in with the long-standing [opposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Republican_Party#Ideological_beginnings) of the ruling Republican party to slavery.
1.1.1.5. Con: In a democracy, a lack of knowledge or understanding does not invalidate anyone's opinion.
1.1.1.6. Pro: It is very easy for a dominant group that controls the spheres of cultural production to ignore experiences which only affect subdominant groups. This phenomenon, which the philosopher Charles Mills calls "[white ignorance](http://shifter-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/mills-white-ignorance.pdf)" in the context of race \(the epistemological factors that allow whites to remain blind to the experience of Black individuals\) is a primary tool in the maintenance of white supremacy.
1.1.2. Con: The preferences of the majority is no indicator of what is right or good.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Public opinion is oftentimes misinformed and inconsistent, e.g. about foreign policy issues. According to a 2013 survey, the average American over-estimates the amount spent by the US on international aid [by a factor of 28](http://kff.org/global-health-policy/poll-finding/2013-survey-of-americans-on-the-u-s-role-in-global-health/).
1.1.2.2. Con: The majority opinion profits from the [wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd), which helps to cancel out individual deficiencies.
1.1.2.3. Con: Democracies like the United States do not claim to make decisions based on what is right or good, but based on the will of the people.
1.1.3. Pro: As the slavery reparations will be paid by citizens' taxes, their opinions have to be taken into consideration.
1.1.3.1. Con: The government does not get to, for example, refuse to pay compensation when successfully sued on the grounds that the public does not support such a payout. This should be no different.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: As we are talking about the government agreeing to a payout of reparations that has not been mandated by a court judgment, this does not make for a valid comparison.
1.1.3.2. Con: Citizens' opinions, except for those expressed through voting, are rarely consulted when making appropriation decisions.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Citizens are not directly consulted when a country goes to war. Some military engagements don't even need immediate congressional assent. e.g. [Libya](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-administration-libya-action-does-not-require-congressional-approval/2011/06/15/AGLttOWH_story.html?utm_term=.692461a78068).
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Many of the decisions taken by a president or an administration do not always reflect the majority opinion of taxpayers, even when their money will be used in implementing it.
1.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Public opposition to the Iraq War [fluctuated](http://www.gallup.com/poll/106783/opposition-iraq-war-reaches-new-high.aspx) between highs and lows \(it was as high as 63% in April 2008\), yet that barely affected the President's attitude to it.
1.1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Most Americans [oppose](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/03/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban-poll/) Donald Trump's Muslim Ban, yet this fact isn't a deterrent to the President's actions in that regard.
1.1.3.2.2.3. Pro: The Obama administration tried to shut down Guantanamo Bay, even though a majority of Americans [oppose](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/04/politics/guantanamo-bay-poll-north-korea/) its closure.
1.1.3.2.2.3.1. Con: The fact that the Obama administration did not succeed in closing Guantanamo Bay can be taken as evidence of the difficulty even a popular leader faces when going against public opinion.
1.1.3.2.2.4. Pro: 75% of Americans are [against](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/01/06/508379529/poll-most-americans-say-dont-repeal-obamacare-without-a-replacement) the repeal of Obamacare \(fully or without replacement\) yet GOP lawmakers have recently tried to repeal it.
1.1.3.3. Pro: If the American government were to pay all its 35.8 million Black citizens a meaningful and adequate reparation, this would be financially hard to stomach for the country.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: Trillions upon trillions of U.S. dollars have been used over the years to fight wars yet that is not seen as being hard for the federal budget 'to stomach.'
1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: These costs are spread out over multiple years and thus far less impactful on the federal budget than one-time reparations would be. The military engagement in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Pakistan thus [have been estimated](http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/figures/2016/us-budgetary-costs-wars-through-2016-479-trillion-and-counting) to have cost a total of "only" about $500 Billion per year since 2001.
1.1.3.3.2. Pro: In 1850, there were 3.2M slaves in the south. To make a crude calculation of what their descendants would fairly be owed, I assume $15k/year in today's dollars as a fair wage, and assume that each had a 20 year career on average. At 2% interest amortized over 150 years, that is around $20T. And that's not nearly all the slaves. To pay them what they are actually owed would bankrupt the nation many times over.
1.1.3.3.3. Pro: Reparations could wreck the federal budget. Demands like those by the The National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America \(N'COBRA\) would result in a total cost of reparations of [about $8 trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Coalition_of_Blacks_for_Reparations_in_America). This is equivalent to twice the [2017 federal budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_States_federal_budget) of the United States.
1.1.3.3.3.1. Con: Nevertheless, the money on reparations would not be lost, as it would return into the economy via spending, investments, and taxes.
1.1.3.3.3.1.1. Con: Reparations as calculated by the N'COBRA would increase [the national debt](https://treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current) of the United States by about 40%. If the annual [interest expenses](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm) for this debt rise by the same percentage, this will cost the government around $90 Billion per year. The economic circulation of reparation money will hardly be able to outweigh this.
1.1.3.3.4. Con: Reparations could be affordable. If every Black American received a hypothetical $10,000 over a period of several years, the total cost would amount to about 400 billion dollars. Spending on this level is apparently possible, as the [equally expensive](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/16/politics/f-35-jsf-operational-costs/) F-35 fighter program shows \(which, on top of that, is generally [considered a failure](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-f-35-joint-strike-fighter-one-americas-worst-fighter-14254)\).
1.1.3.3.4.1. Con: $10,000 over several years is a totally inconsequential sum, and would do practically nothing to alleviate systemic Black poverty in America.
1.1.3.3.5. Con: The number of recipients would most likely be lower than 35.8 million as various groups of Black Americans would likely be excluded, for example migrants.
1.1.3.3.5.1. Pro: Not all African-Americans were enslaved. Many lived freely in the North and can be excluded as well.
1.1.3.3.5.1.1. Con: Even if some Black Americans at the time of the Civil War were free, they account for a small minority. At the time of the Civil War, over four million Black Americans were [slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_racial_and_ethnic_demographics_of_the_United_States#Black_Population_as_a_Percentage_of_the_Total_Population_by_U.S._Region_and_State_.281790.E2.80.932010.29) whereas only around 400,000 were free.
1.1.3.3.5.2. Con: The vast [majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans) \(over 80%\) of Black Americans trace their roots to slaves.
1.1.3.3.5.2.1. Con: Most Black Americans also trace their roots to European ancestry, as there are few Black Americans with 100% African ancestry. Therefore determining reparations on the basis of ancestry is logically conflicted, and would require a fine parsing of exact ethnic ancestral lineages and genetic compositions of every citizen, which would be morally repugnant.
1.1.3.3.5.2.1.1. Con: The relevant question isn't where all of one's ancestry comes from, but where some of it comes from as this is sufficient to establish connection to the unjust act reparations are intended to redress.
1.1.3.3.5.2.1.2. Pro: While estimates vary, the average Black American is assumed to be [20-30% European](https://www.theroot.com/exactly-how-black-is-black-america-1790895185) in terms of their genetic makeup. One in three African American men even have a white male ancestor in their family tree during the era of slavery.
1.1.3.3.5.3. Pro: Not all Black Americans have a connection with slavery. Right now, for example, [more than 1.8 million](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/02/african-immigrant-population-in-u-s-steadily-climbs/) immigrants from Africa are living in the United States.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1. Con: The Black community as a whole, regardless of whether individual Black Americans have a link to slavery, still suffers from the structural, social and economic consequences of slavery.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.1. Pro: The effects of slavery extended beyond the institution of slavery, through Jim Crow laws.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: These laws were in and of themselves cruel, [restricting civil rights and liberties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws) and denying those they targeted education, representation, dignity and economic opportunities.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.1.2. Pro: Black people have been exploited because of society's lack of care for their well-being, most famously in the [Tuskegee Syphilis Experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment), which ran from 1932-1972.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.1.3. Pro: The [Jim Crow Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws) lasted until 1965 and are still remembered by those who are alive.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.1.4. Pro: The [Tulsa Race Riot](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/7/19/survivors-of-infamous1921tulsaraceriotstillhopeforjustice.html) is clearly linked to slavery and has survivors in modern America that seek justice.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.1.5. Con: Not all of these effects are simply traceable to the lingering effects of slavery. For example, under-representation in the legislature also contributes to the continued disadvantage of Black Americans.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.1.5.1. Con: The low number of Black politicians in the House and the Senate has been linked to [racial gerrymandering](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/09/how-a-widespread-practice-to-politically-empower-african-americans-might-actually-harm-them/) and the concentration of Black voters in few districts. As a result, few Black politicians get sent to Washington. This reality can be interpreted as persistent lingering racism.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Redistricting along racial lines can be beneficial if it gives minority groups representatives that serve their interests. [Illinois' 4th congressional district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois%27s_4th_congressional_district), for example, takes a strange shape to improve the representation of the Hispanic minority.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.1.5.1.2. Con: This does not have bearing as to whether African Americans are entitled to reparations for slavery.

Slavery is unrelated to modern-day gerrymandering \(as today, no slaves legally exist\).
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.1.5.1.3. Con: There is [over representation](https://www.fedweek.com/issue-briefs/demographics-of-federal-workforce-summarized/) already of blacks in the federal workforce, compared to [those in America](http://news.gallup.com/poll/4435/public-overestimates-us-black-hispanic-populations.aspx).
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.1.5.1.4. Pro: Over half of America's Black population is concentrated in the blackest 60 congressional districts \(out of 435\), as a result the Black political apparatus has become more and more[ghettoized](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-are-there-no-black-senators/).
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.2. Pro: As [statistics show](http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/24/news/economy/blacks-whites-inequality/), the median household income of Black Americans is about half of that of white Americans while their household wealth is less than a tenth; their rate of home ownership is around half; and their poverty rate is more than twice as large.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.2.1. Con: Even if, on average, African Americans do worse than other Americans economically, it is still true that many individual African Americans do better financially than the average non-black American who’d be expected to pay reparations. It is unjust to ask an impoverished white American to pay towards reparation amounts going to middle class, or even rich, black people on the basis of skin color.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.1.5.1.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4. Con: Slavery was caused by the belief that Black people are lesser beings, not the other way around. Thus, slavery did not cause systemic racism, it is a symptom of the same underlying condition.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.1. Con: Even if slavery did not exclusively cause these harms, it normalised and entrenched them to a significant extent.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.2. Con: Even if one believes that the institution of slavery was functionally irrelevant, those who suffer these harms deserve recompense, and so the rest of the US citizenry should pay reparations.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3. Con: If it had not been for slavery, most Black Americans living today would not even be in the United States or would not have been born in the first place, and would subsequently not have suffered at American hands.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.2.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2. Con: This makes an unwarranted assumption about what constitutes blackness that roots it primarily in ancestry.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1. Pro: While perceptions about ancestry \(often, but not necessarily, rooted in fact\) may play a roles in perceptions about race, race itself is a [social](https://anthropology.net/2008/10/01/race-as-a-social-construct/), not a biological, category.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: Race exists as a biological concept.

Studies like [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3737365/) seem to say that race doesn't exist. But that's a misinterpretation of the study, science can easily demonstrate native genetic differentiation. The study is intended only to show that science has failed to determine where race X ends and race Y begins. Because there is no objective way to do this, there can be no objective way to assign an arbitrary human to a race. Nevertheless, race itself still EXISTS as a gradual spectrum in biology.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Even if there were a modified, scientific biological concept of race it would tell us nothing about the social category of blackness. To the extent that any scientific concept of race remains, it is [genealogical](http://shamiller.net/phi038/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3655739.pdf) or cladistic. However, this concept bears very little resemblance to the folk concept of race and is thus largely irrelevant to this discussion.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The classic Blumenbach partition \(falsely called "folk" race to make it sound ignorant\) does indeed match ancestral clusters identified through genetics. See e.g. "Mapping Human Genetic Diversity in Asia" which establishes a single entry and ancestral origin for East Asians. East Asian/Caucasian/African ancestry groups \(or races\) are routinely used in medicine, genetics, and forensics.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.1.2. Con: Race is not the same thing as native genetic differentiation. Blonde-haired people are not considered a race, for example. There are myriad physiological features that vary across human populations, but those varieties are not, in themselves, racial categories. In fact, similar adaptive traits \(skin color, eye shape, disease resistance, etc.\) can be shared by humans from completely different lineages. Grouping certain humans as a "race," therefore, has purely social implications.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Similar adaptive traits shared by humans across different lineages that correspond geographically IS "race" in exactly the sense that the parent claim uses the term. So this objection is nothing but a semantic argument insisting on an artificially narrow use of term "race".
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.1.2.2. Con: Blonde haired people are not a race. Indeed. Neither are white furred animals considered a taxonomic unit. That's because race and other biological taxa are defined by shared ancestry, not fur color or arbitrary traits. Race is of course a valid biological concept, and to say it's not is motivated entirely by politics not science.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.1.2.2.1. Con: To assert that compare race to "other biological taxa" is to assume that it is a biological classification, which begs the question here.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.1.2.2.2. Con: To the extent that it is asserted that race is a social concept, it is not a criticism to point out that criticisms of it are in part politically motivated.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.2. Pro: The concept that has been defined as race doesn't correspond to any coherent [genetic](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/race-is-not-biological_us_56b8db83e4b04f9b57da89ed) category, or even have a genetic basis.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.3. Pro: The concept of race does not correspond to any coherent set of[phenotypic variations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19226639).
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.3.1. Con: This is true. But it's not because phenotypic variations do not exist. It is true because races \(black, white, asian\) can't be objectively defined and thus NOTHING \(including phenotypic variations\) can be used to categorize people into them. "Racial" phenotypic variations exist \(and are wildly obvious to the most casual observer\), and thus race exists. It's just not useful for racial categorization.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Concepts which are "wildly obvious to the most categorical observer" tend to be folk concepts, and not scientific concepts.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.3.1.2. Con: In fact, race is not the most intuitive way of dividing human beings or describing natural variation.  Scientific [racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism) \(the division of the human species along specifically racial lines\) doesn't originate until the 16th century.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.4. Pro: The philosophical [consensus](http://www.mit.edu/~shaslang/rprg/MallonRNNMS.pdf) is that "racial naturalism" \(the view that race denotes a natural \(i.e. biological or material type\)  is incorrect.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.5. Pro: Cross-cultural and cross-historical [variations](http://www2.bakersfieldcollege.edu/driess/sociology-b1_inequality.pdf) in what corresponds to the concept of race demonstrate that it functions primarily as a social concept.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.1.5.1. Con: "Primarily" isn't sufficient.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.2. Pro: Assuming that most Black Americans would live in Africa "were it not for slavery" essentializes a relationship to some of their ancestry while ignoring others. In fact, "the vast majority of African Americans [also have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans) some European and Native American ancestry."
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.3. Con: In the context of slavery, metrics that indicate blackness other than ancestry are irrelevant.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.3. Con: It is better to be born and suffer than not to exist at all.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.3.1. Pro: If you are suffering but alive, you have a possibility of future non-suffering and/or joy. That possibility is valuable.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.3.2. Pro: If those who are presently suffering due to lack of reparations preferred to be dead instead, they would commit suicide at a higher rate. But instead we see [less than one-third](http://www.sprc.org/racial-ethnic-disparities) the suicide rate among Black Americans as compared with White Americans, with the gap between white and black suicides increasing over time.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.4. Pro: As of 1860, [nine out of ten](http://www.bowdoin.edu/~prael/lesson/tables.htm) Black people in the United States were slaves. The origins of today's Black America therefore lie to a great extent in slavery.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.4.1. Pro: Immigration to the United States from Africa was [insignificant](http://www.inmotionaame.org/print.cfm;jsessionid=f8301098861480423744899?migration=13&bhcp=1) until the 1960s.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.5. Pro: [Racial disparities in school discipline](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615570365?journalCode=pssa&), stemming from stereotypes entrenched during and by slavery, systematically disadvantage and exclude Black students from education.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.6. Pro: [Redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining) and other discriminatory housing practices are felt by the Black community.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.6.1. Con: This an entirely separate issue than reparations for slavery.

African Americans can raise and receive recompense for discriminatory housing practices through legal action today.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.7. Pro: [Mass incarceration](http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/404674/enduring-myth-of-black-criminality/) indicates the institutionalization of racism the Black community has to endure.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.7.1. Con: African American communities have have [significant crime rates](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43) in spite of being only [12.3%](http://news.gallup.com/poll/4435/public-overestimates-us-black-hispanic-populations.aspx) of the population.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.7.1.1. Con: Structural factors, too, influence crimes rates - and Black Americans suffer disproportionately from the factors that correlate with crime. Chief among them are low [educational](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~moretti/lm46.pdf) [attainment](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~moretti/lm46.pdf) and the [prevalence](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1991.tb01087.x/full) [of](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/116/2/655/1904197) [poverty](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/073401689301800203).
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.7.1.1.1. Con: As [researchers](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1982.tb00450.x/full) [emphasize](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00249.x/full), the relationship between poverty and crime is more complicated than often assumed as the two factors don't always rise in tandem, and especially so once a threshold of poverty in a community has been reached.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.7.1.2. Con: Pointing to higher carceral rates as evidence of a propensity to high crime being the cause of higher carceral rates results in a circular argument.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.8. Pro: Statistically, a [low income](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/12/racial-wealth-gaps-great-recession/) for a whole segment of society is an indicator that racism has been institutionalized.
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.8.1. Pro: The difference in average lifetime earnings between a white man and a Black man stands at more than $800,000 \([Williams Shanks/Leigh, p. 51](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Ac2RBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=amon+emeka+lifetime+earnings+2007&source=bl&ots=l4kWvfiX8r&sig=zTt5RSmpo_tqWko0GKeocYuWQO4&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiU8-bb9MDQAhUDf7wKHcTtDXkQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=amon%20emeka%20lifetime%20earnings%202007&f=false)\).
1.1.3.3.5.3.1.8.2. Con: Correlating low income with race only yields causality if you make conclusions based solely upon individuals' race and ignore other factors \(educational attainment, rate of crime, experience, variation in income by region, etc.\).
1.1.3.3.5.3.2. Pro: The importance of this factor is only growing with time as the share of foreign-born Black Americans [is increasing](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/04/09/a-rising-share-of-the-u-s-black-population-is-foreign-born/). It rose from 3.1% in 1980 to 8.7% in 2013; by 2060 it is projected to stand at 16.5%.
1.1.3.3.5.3.3. Con: Indirectly, many of the citizens of today's Africa equally suffered from slavery as it hurt their continent and stifled its development until today \([Nunn, p. 139](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/nunn/files/the_long_term_effects.pdf), [Whatley/Gillezeau, p. 1](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~baileymj/Whatley_Gillezeau.pdf)\).
1.1.3.3.5.3.3.1. Con: The principal problem of African development is unlikely the abduction of male population but more the long-term consequences of [colonization](http://www.academicjournals.org/article/article1425047376_Asafa.pdf).
1.1.3.3.5.3.4. Pro: These numbers grow even higher once the [hundreds of thousands](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0201398.html) of Black migrants to the United States who came decades ago and have since died are taken into account. Many of their children and grandchildren still live in America \(yet have no linkage with slavery\).
1.1.4. Con: During WWII, the majority of the public agreed to internment camps and sending the Japanese \(citizens or not\) back to Japan \([Fried, p. 60](https://books.google.de/books?id=HnGsAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=japanese+reparations+public+opinion+polls&source=bl&ots=dYuQXgJX7g&sig=hNkBogbkqP6teMieSTrBBs6rwKI&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=japanese%20reparations%20public%20opinion%20polls&f=false)\). This sentiment has since changed after the fact, showing that public opinion polls are not reliable and thus should not be used in determining reparations for slave descendants.
1.1.4.1. Con: Just because public opinion can change over the course of decades does not invalidate it. Otherwise, no democratic decision making at all would be feasible.
1.1.5. Con: More than half of Black people in the United States think that reparations are "[a good idea](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/b183a022831d4748963fc8807c204b08/poll-millennials-more-open-idea-slavery-reparations)."
1.1.5.1. Pro: Many prominent African-Americans intellectuals \(from James Baldwin to Ta-Nehisi Coates\) have expressed support for reparations as a way to achieve equity and justice.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: Other prominent African-Americans, such as [Barack Obama](http://atlantablackstar.com/2016/12/29/america-has-compensated-other-groups-but-obama-opposes-reparations-for-black-people-why/), oppose reparations.
1.1.5.2. Con: Black Americans represent only about 13% of the population. Their attitudes are therefore not necessarily representative of America as a whole.
1.1.5.3. Con: The opinions of those who benefit from an action are less important than the impact such a decision would have.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: In America, Congress is allowed to propose and implement an increase of their own salary. This negatively impacts the budget and often goes against the majority desires of the American populace.
1.1.5.3.2. Pro: Focusing exclusively on the opinions of those who would benefit is best summarized as a [conflict of interest](http://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/conflict-of-interest).
1.1.6. Con: Public opinion is superseded by the enormity of the humans rights abuses Black Americans suffered during slavery.
1.1.7. Con: In constitutional democracies, including the US, the opinion of the majority is not the exclusive \(or even the primary\) arbiter of political or legal norms. For example, the judicial system often serves to check the preferences of the majority when those preferences violate more fundamental constitutional principles.
1.1.7.1. Con: Legal and constitutional principles change and are open for interpretation.
1.1.7.2. Con: These judicial mechanisms are not [necessarily](http://democracyweb.org/node/36) a check on the majority. For example, constitutional amendments abolishing slavery and guaranteeing equal rights did not prevent the adoption of segregationist Jim Crow laws in the South or in checking the pervasive discrimination against Black Americans in the North.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: Regardless of whether or not the judiciary has always been successful in blocking unjust decisions made by the majority, it remains a principle that should still be, and often is, applied.
1.1.8. Pro: White America could see reparations as punitive. While policy decisions need not take "hurt feelings" into account, they would further alienate the country along racial lines, or increase resentment on both sides. Healing the US of its history of slavery requires something more sincere and further-reaching than an empty economic gesture, but certainly something that offers lasting economic equality.
1.1.8.1. Con: Paying reparations did not alienate Japanese Americans and white Americans. Given that the sheer inhumanity of the crime against them was even greater than the internment of Japanese Americans, there is no reason to expect that reparations to descendants of slaves should be any different.
1.1.8.1.1. Pro: A key motivation for paying reparations to Japanese Americans was to combat alienation for the [next generation](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/08/09/210138278/japanese-internment-redress) of American Japanese.
1.1.8.2. Con: This doesn't undermine the original claim. Just because white people might see reparations as punitive doesn't mean that they wouldn't fix problems facing the Black community today.
1.1.8.3. Con: Reparations should be and feel punitive.
1.1.8.3.1. Con: From the perspective of criminal justice theory, there is a clear distinction between punishment and reparations: the former aims at deprivation and suffering; the latter aims at making amends, not punishment \([Sayre-McCord, p. 504](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/0029-4624.35.s1.19)\).
1.1.8.3.2. Pro: Reparations and punishment oftentimes go together. Consider the [Treaty of Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles): it forced Germany to pay reparations for World War I - and it was clearly meant to punish.
1.1.8.3.2.1. Pro: US President Woodrow Wilson stated about the treaty that it "seeks to punish one of the greatest wrongs ever done in history" and "there ought to be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment" \([Trachtenberg, p. 17](http://"seeks to punish one of the greatest wrongs ever done in history" and "there ought to be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment")\).
1.1.8.3.2.2. Con: The treaty itself is an argument against conflating reparations with punishment. It became a [source of German humiliation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_231_of_the_Treaty_of_Versailles#German_interpretation) and part of the story of the rise of the Nazis and Hitler.
1.1.9. Con: [History](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/19/black-lives-matters-and-americas-long-history-of-resisting-civil-rights-protesters/?utm_term=.dccc6cde9105) shows that public opinion rarely favors just action until the maintenance of injustice becomes morally and socially untenable. Reparations should be offered in recompense for the gross injustice of slavery as a way of creating a more just environment in the US.
1.1.10. Pro: This would only increase racial tension in the country because certain groups would feel that they are paying for something they personally did not do.
1.1.11. Con: The [majority of millennials](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/millennials-may-eventually-shift-public-opinion-on-slavery-reparations/) do not oppose the idea of paying reparations for slavery. Public opinion might thus be shifting - and those who live in tomorrow's America might prefer one that pays reparations.
1.1.11.1. Con: Young people, who are typically liberal in thinking, oftentimes grow into [conservative-thinking adults](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/do-we-become-more-conservative-with-age-young-old-politics), so the opposition to reparations might harden later.
1.1.12. Con: Attempts to pay reparations did enjoy majority support in the past, such as in [1866](http://www.crf-usa.org/brown-v-board-50th-anniversary/reparations-for-slavery-reading.html) when Congress voted in favor but the president vetoed the bill.
1.1.12.1. Con: That reparations bill was different in nature because it was paying those who suffered from slavery directly.
1.1.12.2. Con: The divided nature of the United States today makes it unlikely that such a proposal will even make it past the legislative houses.
1.1.12.2.1. Pro: President Trump's voter base consists of [only 8%](http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37922587) of Black Americans; [merely 21%](http://www.people-press.org/2016/11/10/a-divided-and-pessimistic-electorate/) of his supporters see racism as a big problem in the United States. There is, thus, little political momentum behind ideas such as slavery reparations.
1.1.12.2.2. Con: The difficulty of doing something that is right, should not be used as an excuse not to do it.
1.1.12.2.3. Pro: Almost [nine out of ten](http://www.people-press.org/2016/09/13/2-party-affiliation-among-voters-1992-2016/) Black Americans identify as Democrats or as leaning towards the platform of the Democratic party. The voting base of the dominant party in Congress, the Republicans, is therefore not Black - and any policies that predominantly favor Black Americans have little political momentum.
1.1.13. Pro: If there is a large enough backlash against reparations, this could jeopardise other policies aimed to alleviate the effects of racism and the legacy of slavery, such as affirmative action.
1.1.13.1. Pro: There have been backlashes when policies run counter to public opinion, as in the case of a [bullfighting](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-38714539) ban in the Indian province of Tamil Nadu.
1.1.13.2. Con: Changing these policies need not be disastrous. With reparations successfully paid, programs like Affirmative Action could be successfully and justifiably discontinued.
1.1.13.2.1. Con: Structural problems cannot be solved simply through financial mechanisms, even if they really did improve the situation of individuals. After all, the individual would still be caught up in the same disadvantageous structure.
1.1.13.2.1.1. Con: While capital may not be a sufficient condition to address these structural inequalities, it is still likely to be a necessary one. That is to say, it would be difficult to imagine how to solve these structural problems without some infusion of money.
1.1.13.2.1.2. Pro: As of 2001, [one in three](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/aug/19/usa.garyyounge) Black men born in that year could expect to spend time in prison. Right now, in states like Oklahoma, [one in 15 Black men](http://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/color-of-justice-racial-and-ethnic-disparity-in-state-prisons/) are incarcerated. As convictions come with long-term disadvantages \(e.g. when applying for jobs\), these Black Americans will profit little from reparations.
1.1.13.2.1.3. Pro: Issues such as geographic segregation, social isolation, a lack of education and membership to networks and institutional practices keep Black Americans from accessing the same opportunities that white citizens have. The availability of capital will hardly be able to overcome these barriers \([Simms et al, p. VI, VII](http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/2000518-Structural-Barriers-to-Racial-Equity-in-Pittsburgh-Expanding-Economic-Opportunity-for-African-American-Men-and-Boys.pdf)\).
1.1.13.2.1.4. Pro: It [has been argued](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/equal-opportunity-our-national-myth/) that America is committed "to the dream of equality of opportunity" - not that of equal outcomes. Creating equality of opportunity requires structural changes that go beyond monetary payments; these only create the illusion of having achieved the equality of outcomes.
1.1.13.2.1.5. Con: Reparations have the potential to improve educational outcomes of Black Americans. This helps remedy disadvantages.
1.1.13.2.1.5.1. Con: Black Americans on average suffer from an [educational achievement gap](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/05/education-inequality-takes-center-stage/483405/) compared to students of other races. Paying out money will do little to balance the lost opportunities because of that.
1.1.13.2.1.5.2. Pro: Perceptions of Black Americans and their status can be improved by working in high-skill jobs. Reparations can provide the funds for Black Americans to get the education necessary for these kinds of jobs.
1.1.13.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: Reparations can provide much needed funds to community centres and organisations, who can help with providing and facilitating this training.
1.1.13.2.1.5.3. Pro: Reparations can help support [under-funded schools](http://www.nea.org/home/15215.htm) within Black communities by providing community members with the funds to increase educational resources necessary for improved academic performance.
1.1.13.2.1.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.13.2.1.5.1.
1.1.13.2.1.5.4. Con: Spending more money alone [has been](http://www.heritage.org/education/report/does-spending-more-education-improve-academic-achievement) [demonstrated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2015/05/08/more-spending-doesnt-lead-to-improved-student-learning/#6be4919d5135) to not improve educational outcomes.
1.1.13.2.1.5.4.1. Con: Even if spending money alone is not sufficient to improve educational outcomes, it is a [necessary](https://www.brookings.edu/research/its-not-nothing-the-role-of-money-in-improving-education/) component.
1.1.13.3. Pro: Reparations to only Black Americans will create envy from other parts of society.
1.1.13.3.1. Con: This envy can be easily dismissed as unjustified by politicians and will have marginal effect on other policy areas.
1.1.13.4. Pro: Giving reparations to Black Americans [will ignite racial tensions](http://www.racism.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=535:repara29d&catid=117:reparations&Itemid=140) within communities where racism against Black Americans is prominent.
1.1.13.4.1. Con: Alternatively, this may instead promote awareness and recognition of the ongoing barriers to success that Black Americans face.
1.2. Con: The connection between the current US and the US in which slavery were practiced is so tenuous that there is no need to pay reparations.
1.2.1. Con: Slavery [shaped the perception of Black Americans.](http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/links/VCU.htm) These negative stereotypes still persist today.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Negative stereotypes mean it is comparatively difficult for Black Americans to succeed in the job market.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Black Americans contribute to the aggregate consumer demand in society, but they take [disproportionately fewer jobs](http://www.npr.org/2016/02/05/465748249/african-americans-face-uncertain-reality-despite-low-unemployment-rate). This means that their presence contributes to the creation of more jobs, but they don't take up as many jobs as they create.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: Experiments illustrate that Blacks are [favored](http://amj.aom.org/content/23/4/738.short) over whites in preselection decisions.
1.2.1.1.3. Pro: Applicants with a Black-sounding name are 50% less likely to be invited for an interview than people with white-sounding names \([Correll & Bernard, p. 4](http://provost.upenn.edu/uploads/media_items/gender-racial-bias.original.pdf)\).
1.2.1.1.4. Pro: Compared to other ethnicities or women, white men are generally attributed with traits that are suitable for high status jobs \([Correll & Bernard, p. 6](http://provost.upenn.edu/uploads/media_items/gender-racial-bias.original.pdf)\).
1.2.1.1.5. Pro: Black Americans face stricter competence [standards](https://www.jstor.org/stable/223435?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) in the workplace than white Americans.
1.2.1.1.6. Pro: It is more difficult for Black Americans to receive [promotions](http://www.nber.org/papers/w21612).
1.2.1.1.7. Pro: In some [US states](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/04/the-states-where-its-much-harder-for-black-people-to-get-jobs-than-white-people/) it is considerably more difficult for Black Americans to find employment.
1.2.1.1.8. Con: Negative stereotypes are not historically determined but socially created. In this sense, it is not slavery in itself that causes these effects but its perception today.
1.2.1.1.9. Con: There has been racial preference for Black Americans in job placements and university entrances.
1.2.1.1.9.1. Con: Black Americans have to cope with racial discrimination in their job searches \([Pager, p.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651212/)\). Given this situation it is difficult to speak of a racial preference in job placements.
1.2.1.1.9.2. Pro: [Steelworkers vs Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Steelworkers_v._Weber) illustrates how in practice Black Americans are favored over white Americans in certain jobs.
1.2.1.1.9.2.1. Con: This is only the case for certain jobs and certain universities. Overall, [evidence](http://www.ibtimes.com/black-graduates-top-colleges-face-discrimination-job-search-salaries-study-finds-1847590) still indicates that Black Americans have a harder time finding jobs and are paid less than equally qualified white candidates.
1.2.1.1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.9.2.1.
1.2.1.1.9.4. Pro: Affirmative action, which is widely practiced in job markets and college admissions, almost guarantees that a black with equivalent or slightly lower qualifications as a competing white will be favored for a position.
1.2.1.1.10. Con: Reparations for slavery \(or lack thereof\) have no relationship to the existence of racial stereotypes.
1.2.1.1.10.1. Con: Many of today's stereotypes that Black Americans see themselves confronted with go back to the era of slavery, for example the idea of the [Black Mammy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammy_archetype), of Black women as [subservient to white people](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/african-american-women-in-advertising), and of Black American's [liking for watermelons](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/12/how-watermelons-became-a-racist-trope/383529/). These stereotypes are therefore among the legacies of slavery that warrant reparations.
1.2.1.2. Con: It is the [media](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/12/media-misrepresents-black-men-effects-felt-real-world) today that shapes negative perceptions of Black Americans.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: The media presents what its research has concluded will attract the most viewers, and thus represents a detectable preference in society as a whole.
1.2.1.3. Pro: In [Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/08/european-racism-africa-slavery), too, the perception of Black people as inferior was shaped by slavery.
1.2.1.4. Con: Black Americans today are negatively stereotyped because of [high crime rates](https://infogram.com/us-crime-in-black-and-white-1gzxop49q0okmwy) in the black community, not because of slavery.
1.2.2. Con: America as a collective entity promoted and profited from the injustice that slavery was.
1.2.2.1. Pro: [15 major corporations](http://atlantablackstar.com/2013/08/26/17-major-companies-never-knew-benefited-slavery/), among them Lehman Brothers and AIG, profited from slavery.
1.2.2.2. Con: As of January 1, 1863, when slavery was ended through the Emancipation Proclamation, [16 of today's US states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_date_of_admission_to_the_Union) with more than [13% of the country's current population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population) had not even been admitted to this collective entity yet. The collective entity from back then is not the same as it is today, and parts of it were not part of the actions of this collective entity.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Most of these were [US territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_incorporated_territories_of_the_United_States) governed by US laws prior to their statehood, and as such are properly counted as part of the US prior to the point at which they became states.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: Along the same logic, it follows that if the US committed or profited from a grossly inhumane act and then tomorrow made Puerto Rico a state, the federal government would not be as responsible tomorrow as it would be today.
1.2.2.2.3. Con: Residents of these states still benefit from the collective wealth of America through federal taxation and spending. Since some of this wealth was extracted through slave labour, they can still be said to benefit from it.
1.2.2.2.3.1. Con: If residents of these states still benefit from collective wealth, that would include those who were suffering under slavery.
1.2.2.2.3.2. Pro: For the United States prior to the Civil War, slavery played [a critical role](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/slavery-and-anti-slavery/resources/was-slavery-engine-american-economic-growth) in economic development and paid for a substantial share of the basis for American economic growth. America as a nation thus profited greatly from slavery.
1.2.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: As the price for a slave was less than £30 in current value until the mid-18th century there was a cheap supply of labor that allowed for wide-scale labor intensive cash crop production \([Eltis et al., p. 679](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0289.2005.00318.x/full)\).
1.2.2.2.3.2.2. Con: It is questionable whether slavery was beneficial for the US at large, as it [stifled](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/09/economic-history-2) innovation, diversification and trade networks.
1.2.2.2.3.2.2.1. Con: Although exact estimates vary greatly based on the mechanism used to calculate the value of the labor, [most scholars put the estimates](http://ncobra.org/resources/pdf/Documenting%20the%20Costs%20Of%20Slavery.pdf) well into the trillions of dollars.
1.2.2.2.3.2.3. Pro: Slavery produced "massive quantities of wealth and treasure", was a booster of economic growth and "made the United States powerful and rich" \([Baptist, p. xii, xxiii](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=dSrXCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Half+Has+Never+Been+Told:+Slavery+and+the+Making+of+American+Capitalism&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRoJunjK_TAhUJKZQKHSq-B5AQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=The%20Half%20Has%20Never%20Been%20Told%3A%20Slavery%20and%20the%20Making%20of%20American%20Capitalism&f=false)\).
1.2.2.2.3.2.3.1. Con: This argument has been criticized for [ignoring](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/01/11/was-america-built-by-slaves/) economic realities and a lack of [quantitative substantiation](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/books/the-half-has-never-been-told-follows-the-money-of-slavery.html).
1.2.2.2.3.2.4. Pro: The North, even after having abolished slavery, profited from slavery.
1.2.2.2.3.2.4.1. Pro: Northerners were able to secure returns on their [investments](http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2014/11/19/slavery-economy-baptist) in Southern slavery businesses.
1.2.2.2.3.2.4.2. Pro: The North was the [point of entry and exit](http://slavenorth.com/profits.htm) for slaves and slave-produced Southern goods.
1.2.2.2.3.2.4.3. Pro: Northern companies gained by [shipping](http://slavenorth.com/profits.htm) slaves domestically.
1.2.2.2.3.2.5. Con: While slavery [has been estimated](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/01/11/was-america-built-by-slaves/) to have contributed about 1 to 1.5% of America's GDP at its high point, this "wasn’t large enough to be the basis of an empire".
1.2.2.2.3.2.6. Pro: The [development of the South](http://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/economic-impact-slavery-south) was heavily driven by the use of slave labour.
1.2.2.2.3.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.3.2.2.1.
1.2.2.2.3.2.6.2. Pro: Producing cotton is very labor intensive and therefore requires cheap labor, such as slaves, to be profitable.
1.2.2.2.3.2.6.2.1. Con: Despite the illegality of modern slavery, we still produce cotton.
1.2.2.2.3.2.6.2.1.1. Con: It may be that mechanization and other modern technological innovations have changed the labor intensive nature of cotton, but that doesn't speak against the centrality of slave labor to cotton production in the antebellum South.
1.2.2.2.3.2.6.2.2. Con: The South [continued to produce cotton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_production_in_the_United_States#Early_period) after the Civil War \([Earl](https://www.sailsinc.org/durfee/earl2.pdf), p. 73\).
1.2.2.2.3.2.6.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.3.2.1.
1.2.2.2.3.2.6.3. Pro: At the time of the Civil War, Southern plantations produced 75% of the world's [cotton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Cotton).
1.2.2.2.3.2.6.4. Pro: Plantations created specific [demands](http://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/economic-impact-slavery-south) and boosted the textile, mining, lumber, ironmongering, and gristmilling industries that produced for them.
1.2.2.2.3.2.6.5. Pro: Slavery was used in public works, such as railroads or waterways \([Starobin, p. 137](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3112351?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\). Creating this public infrastructure - required for long-term growth - would not have been possible as extensively without slaves.
1.2.2.2.3.2.6.6. Pro: Cheap labor allowed Southern industries to compete against more efficient ones in the North and Britain. Without it, companies, such as the Tredegar Iron Company, would have faced tougher competition \([Starobin, p. 135](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3112351?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\). This enabled the later industrialization of the South.
1.2.2.2.3.2.7. Pro: Slavery is [one of the cornerstones](http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2014/11/19/slavery-economy-baptist) of America's rise to become a global power. It lay at the core of its cotton industry, which was "the world’s most widely traded commodity at the time" and thus underpinned America's economic modernization and large-scale industrialization.
1.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.3.2.2.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Current non-monetary methods of benefitting the Black community have proven inadequate at properly providing recompense, meaning that a monetary program is needed to bridge the gap.
1.2.2.5. Con: The entire population has turned over, and the government has changed innumerable times. Just because something happened in the same geographic location does not mean the societies are related.
1.2.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.3.2.
1.2.2.7. Con: A collective entity is, by definition, a group of individuals. None of the individuals who promoted or profited from slavery are alive anymore. America is thus a different collective actor today than it was in the era of slavery.
1.2.2.7.1. Con: The current collective actor, 'The US', is linked to the past collective actor by virtue of the continuity of its constitutional structure and institutions.
1.2.2.7.2. Con: The nature of a collective entity is that it goes beyond the mere sum of its parts. If not, the American people would not be the American people but merely a group of people.
1.2.2.7.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.3.2.
1.2.2.8. Pro: Indeed, Americans today continue to benefit from the ways in which the US at the time took advantage of the labour of slaves.
1.2.2.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.2.8.2. Pro: Because [capital begets capital](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm), the disenfranchised position of Black Americans prevented them from being in a position of wealth today, while slave-owning families have been able to pass on their wealth from generation to generation.
1.2.2.8.2.1. Con: [91.9%](http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html) of Americans receive no inheritance. This is therefore not a problem specific to any social group.
1.2.2.8.2.1.1. Con: Inheritance is not the only form of wealth transfer. Paying for college, down payments on houses, etc. make it easier to accumulate wealth with no technical "inheritance."
1.2.2.8.2.1.1.1. Pro: Home ownership and usual income can account for 80 percent of the observed wealth differences between white and Black families [\(Thompson/Suarez, p. 33\)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2015/files/2015076pap.pdf). Reparations can provide the capital for homeownership.
1.2.2.8.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Upon finding that the chance of upward mobility is increased if young children are exposed to resources that are typically reserved for the rich \(e.g., better schooling and safer neighborhoods\), Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren recommend [housing voucher programs](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/assets/documents/nbhds_exec_summary.pdf) to enable lower-income families to move to better neighborhoods with quality pre-school programs.
1.2.2.8.2.1.1.2. Pro: White Americans' parents on average contribute more to the cost of their college degrees, and are able to pay for more without borrowing \([Sallie Mae, p. 32](http://news.salliemae.com/files/doc_library/file/HowAmericaPaysforCollege2016FNL.pdf)\). This increases the chance that they will be able to attend college, or attend the highest quality college available, compared to their Black peers.
1.2.2.8.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.8.2.1.1.1.
1.2.2.8.2.3. Pro: People's lives get indirectly affected by actions in the past. For example, descendants of slaves don't get to live off the wealth that the descendants of slave owners have.
1.2.2.9. Con: Without slavery, America might not have become as prosperous and powerful as it is today - and Black Americans [might be worse off](http://www.ocregister.com/articles/slavery-375430-enslaved-blacks.html) in absolute terms than they are now.
1.2.2.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.
1.2.2.9.2. Con: Even if some benefit might incidentally accrue to an individual from a harm, this does not remove the moral or legal obligation to provide recompense for the harm. While it is still necessary to establish that there was a harm done \(and that there is someone to whom reparations for that harm are owed\), the mere fact of some benefits is insufficient reason to show that reparations are not owed.
1.2.2.9.2.1. Con: The parent claim does not substantiate the existence of any legal or moral obligation, and therefore commits the logical fallacy of [begging the question](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question) in which an argument's premises assume the truth of the conclusion, instead of supporting it.
1.2.2.9.2.1.1. Con: The grandparent claim does not attempt to substantiate, nor does it rely on, assuming any legal or moral obligation arising from a harm. Rather, it merely asserts that *if* such an obligation exists it is not overridden by any incidental benefit that may also have accrued.
1.2.2.9.2.1.1.1. Con: The parent claim is based on a misreading of the great grandparent claim, which does indeed assert that moral and legal obligations exist. The existence of moral and legal obligations is not dependent on whether incidental benefit arises from a harm, and therefore the 'if' statement at the start of the claim does not apply to it.
1.2.2.9.3. Pro: Black Americans are more privileged than their distant African relatives by far.
1.2.2.9.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.2.
1.2.2.9.3.2. Con: The disadvantagement that Black Americans experience puts them, by some measures, in a position that is worse than the position of citizens of many African countries.
1.2.2.9.3.2.1. Pro: The annual homicide rate among Black Americans stands [at over 20](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6631a9.htm) per 100.000 people, which is four times the American average. It is also higher than the overall homicide rate in [practically all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate) \(54 out of 56\) African countries.
1.2.2.9.3.2.2. Pro: [Nine out of ten](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/10/25/559015355/how-black-americans-see-discrimination) Black Americans see discrimination in the US against their own; most experience discrimination themselves. Half say they did at the hands of police or when trying to find housing, through slurs or offensive comments or assumptions about them \([NPR, p. 7, 9](http://www.npr.org/assets/img/2017/10/23/discriminationpoll-african-americans.pdf)\). This experience is most likely less prevalent for citizens of African countries.
1.2.2.9.4. Con: If we assume that America's slaves would have lived on the African continent if the transatlantic slave trade would not have existed, their descendants might have been better off than they are today. The transatlantic slave trade, after all, is assumed to have hampered African development in the long run and until today \([Nunn](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/nunn/files/the_long_term_effects.pdf), [Whatley/Gillezeau](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~baileymj/Whatley_Gillezeau.pdf)\).
1.2.2.9.4.1. Pro: Research points to a negative correlation between the number of slaves taken from a country and its subsequent economic development - and especially so after their independence and in the second half of the 20th century \([Nunn, p. 167f.](https://web.stanford.edu/group/scspi/_media/pdf/Reference%20Media/Nunn_2008_Development%20Economics.pdf)\).
1.2.2.9.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.
1.2.2.9.4.3. Con: Tribalism, religion, dictatorships, and climate have much more to do with its current state than does the slave trade.
1.2.2.9.4.4. Con: Insofar as "the best counterfactuals begin with clearly specified plausible worlds involving small and easily imaginable changes from the real world. They make relatively short-term predictions based on empirically validated theoretical generalizations and on secondary counterfactuals that are mutually consistent," \([Levy](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cf29/98ccb9320a0966094ce7136f1554e13f65c4.pdf)\) the counterfactual set of assumptions that would determine harm by comparing Black Americans to present day Africans should be regarded as relatively poor assumptions.
1.2.2.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.3.2.
1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.2.4. Con: The trauma caused by slavery resulted in [genetic](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp201777a.html) modifications that are expressed as a disposition for post traumatic stress disorder among Black Americans today.
1.2.4.1. Con: This is a case of "correlation does not equal causation". While the referenced study does indicate a hereditary link for PTSD, the study does not backup the claim that a predisposition for PTSD among African Americans is linked to slavery.
1.2.4.2. Con: If a genetic link is established, it is at least equally likely that any hereditary causation of PTSD is due to social injustice and trauma experienced in the century and a half since slavery was abolished.
1.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.
1.2.6. Con: Family ancestry provides a link between current and slavery-era society.
1.2.6.1. Pro: The matrifocal family became typical of Black Americans both during slavery and after emancipation and has been perpetuated to the present [\(Tolman, p.1\)](http://www.leaveafamilylegacy.com/African_American_Families.pdf).
1.2.6.1.1. Con: There is no distinctly Black American family as much as there are no distinctly white American families, see for example the wage, education or weight gaps within the Black American Community.
1.2.6.1.2. Con: Family structures have changed significantly since the times of slavery for all ethnic groups. During the last [30 years](https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/47701118.pdf) alone, there were massive transformations in regard to fertility, maternal employment and divorce rates. Speaking of a 'typical' Black family is therefore most likely flawed.
1.2.6.1.3. Pro: The separation of families as a result of slavery and sexual rape shaped matriarchal family structures \([Gray, p. 3](http://www.academia.edu/5595066/A_Thesis_On_Black_Single_Motherhood_From_Slavery_and_Beyond)\).
1.2.6.2. Pro: Some members of the Black community have direct memory of slavery through the stories of their [grandparents](http://www.blogher.com/greatgrandfather-jordan-former-slave-fourth-july).
1.2.7. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.2.
1.2.8. Pro: Even if we take the families of slaves into account: no [first-degree relatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-degree_relatives) of US slaves are alive anymore. And once we go beyond this first degree of relatedness, the designation of what family actually refers to becomes arbitrary.
1.2.8.1. Con: Examples of [second-degree relatives](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1635.3) include grandparents, aunts, and first cousins. It can't be "arbitrary" to consider these people family.
1.2.9. Con: Today's society evolved from the society of the times of slavery, thus there is an obvious link between the society from back then and today's society
1.2.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.2.9.2. Con: All societies evolved from prior societies. At some point, we must stop asking the children to bear the sins of their parents.
1.2.9.2.1. Con: The question of reparations isn't a theological question of paying for sins but a financial of making recompense for concrete wrongs done. As long as those wrongs influence present society, present society remains linked to past society.
1.2.9.2.2. Con: That all societies evolved from prior societies is a a truism that is irrelevant to determining whether or not there are relevant connections between contemporary American society and earlier American societies specifically.
1.2.9.3. Pro: The connection between the current US and the original US colonies is debatable. However, the US at the time of the first US president and the US of today is undoubtedly the same government/country.
1.2.9.3.1. Pro: The federal government utilized the labor of slaves, for example when constructing the [White House](https://www.whitehousehistory.org/questions/did-slaves-build-the-white-house) and the [Capitol building](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99549328), structures which still exist.
1.2.9.3.1.1. Con: The question being discussed is whether the US owned slaves. The fact that the US utilized slave labor does not mean the US held slaves.
1.2.9.3.2. Pro: The labor value taken from slaves from 1790 to 1860 has been estimated to amount to between 7 and 40 Billion dollars, and even more once lost interest earnings are taken into account, which supposedly resulted in substantial tax revenues for the US government \([Feagin, p. 53](http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/blj/vol20/feagin.pdf)\).
1.2.9.3.2.1. Con: The U.S. government never taxed income concurrently with allowing slavery, and was at the time [supported almost entirely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_history_of_the_United_States) by tariffs on imports and a whiskey tax. In fact, the first income tax required the 16th Amendment to the constitution and was levied in order to pay for the Union Effort in the Civil War.
1.2.9.3.2.2. Con: That money is long gone. It has been pumped into infrastructure that benefits all, social programs, defense, etc.
1.2.9.3.2.2.1. Con: To say that the money has been pumped into infrastructure is simply an explanation of how the investment of capital works. It is wrong to say of capital investment that the "money is gone."
1.2.9.3.3. Con: While the structure of the U.S. government resembles a similar shape with three branches, their has been a significant growth in state and territory representation; making the citizens of these states pay reparations would be unfair.
1.2.9.3.4. Con: It should be noted that while obviously the US remains the US, the stance on slavery changed upon the ratification of the 13th amendment to the constitution. Arguing that the country has not changed in substantial ways is inaccurate.
1.2.10. Pro: There have been a number of waves of immigrants into the US since slavery was abolished. These people had nothing to do with slavery in the US and shouldn't be penalized for it.
1.2.10.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.8.
1.2.10.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.2.10.3. Pro: In 2016 it was estimated that approximate 13.5% of US population \(43m\) was made of legal immigrants. A greater majority of American citizens are descendants of the millions who have immigrated in since the abolition of slavery.[migrationpolicy.org](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/us-immigration-trends#history)
1.2.11. Con: -> See 1.2.9.3.
1.2.12. Con: Americans still live in a mostly segregated [society](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-diverse-cities-are-often-the-most-segregated/).
1.2.13. Pro: Reparations would benefit people who have never been slaves at the expense of people who have never owned slaves.
1.2.13.1. Pro: Reparations would give a financial benefit to a segment of society that has not experienced slavery themselves.
1.2.13.1.1. Pro: The government should not discriminate, even positively, on the basis of race.
1.2.13.1.1.1. Con: Reparations are not a form of discrimination. Rather, they rectify past discrimination.
1.2.13.1.1.1.1. Con: If the recipients of reparations were obvious victims of slavery, this could be easily agreed on. But as none of the potential recipients would be direct victims of slavery, it is unlikely that a consensus of what prejudice is being addressed would arise.
1.2.13.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Someone whose ancestor was a slave might easily be shown to be a direct victim of slavery as the social stigma can still exist and be psychologically disabling. That this is questioned above is perceived as a violation of the right to identity and family history.
1.2.13.1.1.2. Con: [Minority Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_rights) are a standard feature of democratic states. There is no fundamental problem in giving ethnic or racial groups special treatment.
1.2.13.1.1.2.1. Con: Minority rights usually do not come in the form of financial benefits purely based on membership to a minority and without any further qualifications.
1.2.13.1.1.2.2. Con: Minority rights are simply universal human rights. Such charters ensure minorities are not oppressed by the majority but, in principle, it does not make them recipients of special treatment.
1.2.13.1.1.2.3. Con: Just because they are a standard feature does not mean they are just and fair.
1.2.13.1.1.2.4. Con: The 14th amendment to the US Constitution requires that the government give equal protection of the law to each individual. To whatever extent "minority rights" aligns with this it is allowed and just. To whatever extent it contradicts this it is not allowed and unjust.
1.2.13.1.1.3. Pro: The result would be a system in which a certain share of the population has a special right to financial benefits via birth, thus entrenching the idea that Americans are not born equal.
1.2.13.1.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.2.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2. Con: Paying reparations would not suggest that Black Americans are different any more than the U.S. paying reparations to Japanese families for unlawful internment suggested they were different. Rather, it suggests that they have been treated differently.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1. Con: These reparations were paid to the victims of the internment, not to their descendants or all ethnic Japanese in the United States. As no direct victims of slavery are alive anymore, this case does not make for a valid comparison.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Just as people's children inherit their property and debts, so too do they inherit the debts owed to them. That the US failed to discharge those debts in a timely fashion does not erase them.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: There are legal precedents that give descendants the right to restitution of damage caused to ancestors.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: There are [clear legal frameworks](http://www.spiegel.de/international/nazi-looted-art-new-handbook-helps-descendents-reclaim-nazi-loot-a-463423.html) that help descendants of victims reclaim Nazi looted art.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: In this case, the tangible property still exists, the theft is provable, and the injury was carried out directly by agents acting on behalf of the German government. In the case of slavery, the magnitude of the ill-gotten gains and who might possess them are both theoretical and the perpetrators were a variety of long-dead private citizens and companies that may or may not still exist, acting in their own interests.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: If the courts begin punishing ancestors for the mistakes of their forefathers, would that not set a precedent which would leave any individual vulnerable depending upon their family history from then on?
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.3. Con: Following this logic, individuals would be responsible for crimes that their family members commit, even if they are not in any way involved. In most cases, there would not even be centuries in between this transfer of responsibility, as is the case here. Yet this is clearly not a logic that is appropriate.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Crime is not transferable, but financial responsibilities are.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.3.2. Con: The descendants of perpetrators may not have committed the crimes, yet they are oftentimes involved and still benefit from them.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Various big companies that have been powering Germany's economy for the past decades exploited slave labor during the Nazi era, [for example BMW and Daimler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_Private_Companies_that_Exploited_Slave_Labor_from_the_Natzweiler-Struthof_Concentration_Camps).
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Germany benefited from reconstruction dollars more so than the slave labour of the Nazi era and they have made every possible effort to correct the errors of that era. The US is not even willing to have a national dialogue on this topic.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: A very substantial amount of U.S. wealth was created through the exploitation of slave labor. That wealth became the foundational wealth of the United States which systematically accrued to white people. As it stands the U.S. is a hundred and fifty years behind in correcting the distribution of its wealth.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: As of 1860, [more millionaires](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/06/slavery-made-america/373288/) - all of which were slaveholders - were living in the lower Mississippi Valley than anywhere else in the US. This illustrates how slavery helped the accumulation of wealth.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.3.2.2.2. Pro: In 1860, the nearly four million slaves in the US were the [most valuable asset](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/06/slavery-made-america/373288/) in the US economy, worth more than all manufacturing and railroads together.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.3.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.3.2.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.2. Con: Individuals are responsible only for their own actions, not for those of their ancestors.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.3. Con: The descendants of slaves may have a claim to reparations, however since the perpetrators of slavery are also dead, the question arises of who would be responsible to pay the debt. If a man commits a crime but somehow manages to avoid serving the prison time, the jail sentence can't be imposed on his children after he dies.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: This payment to victims resembles more the [Black Lung program of 1973](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/06/the-elusive-specificity-of-reparations/372255/), as payments were made for harm inflicted by the government to individuals.
1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: It is not similar, because almost no black person alive in the US was a slave or had a direct family member be a slave, since slavery was abolished over 150 years ago.
1.2.13.1.1.3.3. Con: A lump sum correction wouldn't create a system, because it would be a one time event.
1.2.13.1.1.3.4. Con: A system in which one has special privileges via birth already exists implicitly for white Americans in the form of [greater economic mobility](https://www.brookings.edu/research/economic-mobility-of-black-and-white-families/). Reparations might help balance that scale.
1.2.13.1.1.3.5. Con: Reparations may send the wrong message, yes, but that message can be corrected, as follows: "African Americans are receiving reparations not merely because of their ancestry but also because of how their ancestors were treated."
1.2.13.1.1.3.6. Con: It is unjust to condemn reparations for \(supposedly\) sending the message that we are not born equal, while condoning inheritance, which \(by parallel reasoning\) sends a similar message.
1.2.13.1.1.4. Con: The state has historically given similar compensation or special treatment to other mistreated groups, e.g [Japanese](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/08/09/210138278/japanese-internment-redress) and [Native Americans](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/~kmporter/historyreparations.htm).
1.2.13.1.1.4.1. Pro: For many years, Native American tribes have received [compensation](http://www.prrac.org/full_text.php?%20text_id=649&item_id=6623&newsletter_id=17) for lands ceded to the US by them in various treaties.
1.2.13.1.1.4.1.1. Con: The fact that legislation was made in the past does not mean that such legislation was justified. Otherwise the fact that slavery was previously legal would be a justification for slavery.
1.2.13.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: The reparations received by Native American tribes were significant, for example the [$963 Million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Native_Claims_Settlement_Act#Background) in addition to 44 million acres of land given to Alaskan Natives or the [$105 Million](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/~kmporter/historyreparations.htm) given to the Sioux of South Dakota.
1.2.13.1.1.4.1.3. Con: This compensation [is paid in lieu of returning the land itself to the tribes](http://www.prrac.org/full_text.php?%20text_id=649&item_id=6623&newsletter_id=17). There is no comparable asset in the case of slavery, unless one argues that slavery is a particularly egregious form of wage theft. In that case, slave owners and not the government would be the responsible party.
1.2.13.1.1.4.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.3.1.
1.2.13.1.1.4.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.9.3.2.
1.2.13.1.1.4.2. Con: Most compensation payments by the United States went to victims of injustices who were still alive. Reparations, on the other hand, would be paid to descendants of victims who were not directly affected.
1.2.13.1.1.4.2.1. Con: Even if it isn't a direct compensation to victims, a symbolic gesture to admitting a past atrocity is a good enough moral cause.
1.2.13.1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: The US did apologize for slavery and Jim Crow laws. It [was issued](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93059465) by the US House of Representatives in July of 2008.
1.2.13.1.1.4.2.2. Pro: Japanese and Native Americans were directly impacted by the cruelty and by the reparations. These reparations helped to change the consequences of those unfortunate actions.
1.2.13.1.1.4.2.3. Con: We often compensate relatives of victims. For example, if my neighbor kills me, my wife will have a claim for compensation against him. There is just no requirement that the victim has to be a living recipient of the compensation.
1.2.13.1.1.4.3. Con: The reparations the US has paid were to those directly harmed by the government itself. The US government never held slaves itself, so they cannot be held directly responsible for reparations.
1.2.13.1.1.4.3.1. Con: While the U.S. Government never held slaves itself, it did promulgate many laws and institutions which codified and enforced slavery and profit from slavery in other ways.
1.2.13.1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Politicians of the time understood that their actions could lead to future calls for compensation, it's just that they thought those calls would come once again from the slaveowners. Similar to how the British government abolished slavery \(though allowing a lot to continue\) with a view to maintaining the empire and appeasing the very anti-slavery home population who abhorred it.
1.2.13.1.1.4.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.3.1.
1.2.13.1.1.4.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.3.2.
1.2.13.1.1.4.3.2. Con: The U.S. government ignored the human rights abuses African-Americans endured & failed to protect those citizens under constitutional law. Turning a blind eye while having the power to stop those abuses constitutes a direct harm by the government itself in the form of negligence. The government protected the human rights of every other American citizen except African-Americans.
1.2.13.1.1.4.4. Con: Native Americans were reimbursed for land, the rights to which were often determined by treaty. Thus, there is a legal foundation for reparations. In the case of slavery, there is not.
1.2.13.1.1.4.5. Pro: Under the [Civil Liberties Act](http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Civil%20Liberties%20Act%20of%201988/) \(1988\) the US government apologized for Japanese American internment during World War II and provided [reparations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Liberties_Act_of_1988#Redress_and_reparations) of $20,000 to each survivor, to compensate for loss of property and liberty during that period.
1.2.13.1.1.4.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.
1.2.13.1.1.5. Pro: It is unfair to give money to privileged Black Americans when underprivileged members of other ethnicities do not receive similar compensation.
1.2.13.1.1.5.1. Con: The reason that these underprivileged members of other ethnicities would not profit from reparations is that they were not affected by slavery - that is how reparations work.
1.2.13.1.1.5.1.1. Con: It seems likely that poorer non-black Americans have less wealth because their ancestors also experienced injustice \(e.g. Irish immigrants forced to immigrate due to cruel British policies during the Potato Famine only to be greeted with “Irish need not apply” signs when seeking work in America\). Given that most modern Americans have ancestors who suffered injustice, it is unjust to single out for reparations Americans with ancestors who encountered only one specific form of injustice \(slavery\)
1.2.13.1.1.5.2. Pro: If the core of the issue, what we want to fix, is income disparity, then supplement low income households across all races. Supplementing people based on race is also supplementing the rich, and neglecting low income white households.
1.2.13.1.1.5.2.1. Con: The core of the issue is not income disparity, it is repayment for generations of unpaid labor.
1.2.13.1.1.5.2.2. Con: We already have a welfare system that does pays supplementary monies to impoverished families.
1.2.13.1.1.5.2.2.1. Con: If the welfare system worked, it would be sufficient for all ethnic groups.
1.2.13.1.1.5.3. Con: It is not unfair to give money to privileged black Americans because they would have risen to a higher level of privilege \(a level roughly equal to that which would be attained through reparations\) if they had not faced the challenges and traumas of slavery and segregation.
1.2.13.1.1.5.4. Con: Blacks were enslaved in America in the millions, a scale much greater than other ethnicities.
1.2.13.1.1.6. Pro: Giving a segment of society financial benefits is granting them what has been called '[citizenship plus](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=u03fCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT20&lpg=PT20&dq=accidental+activists+citizenship+plus&source=bl&ots=W9Jgw7Fv8N&sig=FeD5Qv8yfrl5PFNXJsgGUjLdkWY&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQzcXfnObPAhVmxFQKHZqMAUgQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=accidental%20activists%20citizenship%20plus&f=false)' status, in which a certain segment receives more than other citizens of society, and therefore violates the equality principle in US politics.
1.2.13.1.1.6.1. Con: This is not giving special advantages to any group, but repaying them for special disadvantages that state action allowed, condoned and perpetuated.
1.2.13.1.1.6.1.1. Con: A social group receiving money from the state based solely on belonging to that group is a special advantage.
1.2.13.1.1.6.1.1.1. Con: This assumes that the playing field is equal for all social groups, which it is [not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_privilege). Reparations would level this playing field.
1.2.13.1.1.6.1.2. Con: This is a moral claim many groups can put forward, such as women.
1.2.13.1.1.6.1.2.1. Con: It may be that other groups are also owed reparations. However, these claims should all be evaluated on their own merits.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2. Con: Countries have all kinds of schemes that give certain groups financial advantages. Tax breaks for married couples or families with children are one common set of examples.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1. Con: In these cases, behavior that is seen as beneficial for society as a whole is being encouraged through financial incentives. Reparations, on the other hand, are not linked to behavior of this kind and thus do little for the greater good.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.1. Con: The greater good is served by empowering marginalized populations within the greater community. The behavior supported is active participation within the US economy.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2. Pro: Tax breaks for married couples or families with children are necessary tools for the government to keep fertility rates high. Reparations, in contrast, do not entail widespread benefit for the state.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.1.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2. Con: American society would [benefit economically](http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2014/06/04/why-reparations-for-slavery-could-help-boost-the-economy/) from giving reparations to descendants of slaves.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.1. Con: As the source argues, "one-time payments are temporary" and likely to produce easily reversible effects. It is unlikely that this economic benefit will be lasting.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Keynesianism argues that a one time impetus can '[prime the pump](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pump-priming.asp)' and have long-lasting economic benefits.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Viewing this as a primarily short term economical question is deeply flawed. Paying reparations could have many societal impacts contributing to a more integrated and healthy intercultural economy in the long term. A cross-cultural event focused on empathy could be initiated, in effect healing many wounds that have a great economic impact on intercultural interactions today.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: A cross-cultural event that singles out one group may have significant negative effects.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: A quarter of all Black Americans and almost half of Black children [live in poverty](http://stateofworkingamerica.org/fact-sheets/poverty/). It is highly unlikely that these people will be able to make decisions to overcome this status just because they suddenly have access to capital.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.1.3.1. Con: It is paternalistic to assume that impoverished individuals would make worse decisions when they have access to capital than other individuals do.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Most people have more problems when they gain more money. [Take lottery winners for example.](http://time.com/money/4503078/powerball-jackpot-lottery-winner-neighbors-bankrupt/)
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.1.3.2. Pro: Poverty [impairs cognitive abilities](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6149/976.abstract) and [reduces willpower](https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/willpower-poverty-financial.pdf) regarding financial decisions, thus leading to behavior that is counter-productive to overcoming poverty.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.1.3.2.1. Con: The mechanisms that cause this harm - which, in both studies, are about short-term stress - would be reduced when people are lifted out of poverty by reparations.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: Reparations would give Black Americans the capital needed to start or expand their businesses. This directly benefits the entire economy by alleviating poverty and stimulating spending within impoverished communities, thus integrating them into the broader economy.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.2.1. Con: If you want to make this a grant to African Americans to start businesses or go to college, then that's a different argument. But to just hand money to people won't make that much of a difference in the long run. People will just spend the money on consumer items that won't help them get ahead. There are multiple socioeconomic factors that are hurting minorities in America today, giving them a payoff won't help them.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Reparations can take many forms, including the forms of grants mentioned above. Indeed, some form of capital would be necessary for these grants to materialize, and reparations could provide that capital.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.2.2. Con: This argument could be made for any category of low-income or low-wealth people. If our goal was to be "alleviating poverty and stimulating spending within impoverished communities" then doing so along racial lines will do nothing to ameliorate racial tensions in the United States.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.2.2.2. Pro: The government choosing to only ameliorate poverty for certain races would serve as a powerful recruitment device for racist extremist groups.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3. Pro: Reparations would work like a giant economic stimulus package.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Black Americans have low [saving rates](http://thepowerisnow.com/savings-rate-of-african-americans/). Thus, money received through reparations would be channeled into the economy directly.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.1.1. Con: As the [source](http://thepowerisnow.com/savings-rate-of-african-americans/) states, the most likely reason is that Black Americans do not earn enough to save. The money paid out to them as reparations might give them a chance to save.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Since the effects of slavery have kept many Black Americans in poverty, much of the money received may have to go to [debt settlement and other expenses](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/debt-black-families/409756/), with very little going into savings.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Even just clearing existing debts is a starting point for savings - when income is no longer eaten up by interest fees on debt, individuals can begin to save.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.2. Con: A stimulus package based on reparations is unfair as it only favors Black Americans.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.5.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.2.2. Con: First and foremost, these payments would be reparations; that they work as a stimulus package is only a secondary effect and justification. Thus there is nothing unfair to them.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.2.3. Con: The effect of stimulus packages reverberate through the economy, creating jobs and wealth for all as they're spent.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.2.3.1. Con: There is [direct proof](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/10/financial_bailout_would_impose.html) that bailouts like this would cause more harm than benefit.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.3. Con: Slavery reparations are extremely unlikely to cause any macroeconomic effect. Compared to the [$12 trillion](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/13/12-trillion-of-qe-and-the-lowest-rates-in-5000-years-for-this.html) quantitative easing package, slavery reparations are a flyspeck.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.4. Con: Emphasizing the economic benefits of this policy undermines its purpose as restorative justice.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.5. Con: The effectiveness of a "stimulus package" to produce real wealth is [bad economics](https://fee.org/articles/deconstructing-the-stimulus-doctrine/). There is no real wealth produced when you shuffle money from one person to another. That would be like taking water from the deep end of the swimming pool, dumping it in the shallow end, and expecting the shallow end to get deeper.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.5.1. Con: Most sources disagree with the opinion piece provided, which itself is hosted on a website that most would consider biased. The Foundation for Economic Education has been accused of unscientific [climate change skepticism](http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/climate-deniers/front-groups/foundation-for-economic-education-fee/) and has been linked to donors with a [clear pro-market agenda](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Foundation_for_Economic_Education), e.g. the network of the Koch brothers.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.5.2. Con: The swimming pool analogy is not how economics works. Total available money is not a fixed quantity, unlike water in a swimming pool.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.4. Pro: A one-time payment, properly directed, could make substantial progress towards ameliorating poverty, thus reducing the need for the social safety net.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.4.1. Pro: Black Americans are more likely to participate in [government assistance programs](http://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-97.html) each month than other Americans. Reparations would decrease reliance on these programs, thus reducing the overall welfare expenditure.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.4.1.1. Con: That is a baseless assumption. The proponents of reparations would never allow them to be offset by other reductions in social programs. The reparations would be additional spending and would not reduce other spending.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.4.2. Con: There is a lot of [research](https://secure.marketwatch.com/story/why-lottery-winners-go-bankrupt-1301002181742) to suggest that quite the opposite would happen. Just a small percentage of lottery winners keep their wealth for more than a couple of years just because of the fact that they can't handle money properly.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.4.3. Con: Trillions of dollars have been spent in the "war on poverty" yet poverty is at almost the same level as when that started.  There's no logical reason to assume that spending billions, or trillions, more on reparations would affect poverty.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.4.4. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.1.3.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5. Con: Reparations are too expensive.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.2. Con: Reparations are not expensive when you compare them against the suffering and rightly-held grievances caused by slavery.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.2.1. Con: Nevertheless: reparations would monetarily be extraordinarily expensive regardless of the amount of suffering and harm caused by slavery.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.2.2. Pro: Not to mention the total accounting of those sufferings have never been fully calculated.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.3. Con: Calling reparations "too expensive" without even calculating projections for how much they would sum to is fallacious thinking.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.3.1. Pro: Such a claim could be made of every war the US has ever fought in. And it would prove invalid in many cases \(e.g. was ending slavery after the US Civil War--the bloodiest war in American history--"too expensive"?\).
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.4. Pro: If America pays reparations for slavery, that would not only be expensive in and of itself, it might also set a precedent for future reparations that would be equally expensive and set in motion a whole chain of large-scale money spending schemes.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.4.1. Con: America as a nation has committed no other crime that is comparable in duration and extent to that of slavery. It is therefore unlikely that demands for comparable reparations will follow.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.5. Con: They aren't intrinsically expensive, the payment could be a symbolic one. Many of the points in favour of reparations would be met even if the payment was small.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.6. Con: Just because a debt is large does not mean it does not exist.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7. Pro: The US is already nearly [$20 trillion](http://www.usdebtclock.org/) in debt and cannot afford expensive programs like reparations.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.1. Con: The US can not go bankrupt in its own currency as the FED can finance the government directly.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.1.1. Con: While America may be able to prevent bankruptcy by printing money, this would cause high inflation, destroy the global confidence in the dollar and possibly lead to a economic crisis, all of which are highly dangerous outcomes.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.2. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.3.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3. Con: There are a number of ways that we could pay for reparations that would be economically sustainable.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.1. Pro: The reparations could be funded via increased estate taxes.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.1.1. Con: A tax on all money given to offspring, aka estate tax, would disincentivise people from saving or helping future generations, leading to no change in the current economic inequalities.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.2. Pro: Reparations could be funded via property seized from hate criminals, and intellectual property rights to symbols of slavery \(e.g., give the NAACP the trademark to the Confederate Flag\)
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.3. Pro: Compared to other developed nations, the U.S. has a very low tax rate. Thus, taxes could easily be raised to finance reparations.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.3.1. Pro: The U.S. currently has a tax-to-GDP ratio of 26.4%, compared to the OECD average of 34.3% \([OECD, p. 1](http://www.oecd.org/tax/revenue-statistics-united-states.pdf)\).
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.3.1.1. Con: Compared with 113 other countries, the U.S. ranks [54th](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/01/how-low-are-us-taxes-compared-to-other-countries/267148/) for tax levels for higher income groups. While it might not have the highest rate, other developed countries, such as the Czech Republic, Switzerland or Korea, have even lower rates.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.3.2. Con: Higher tax rates discourage people from engaging in economic activity and, therewith, reduce economic growth.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.3.3. Con: Raising taxes makes an economy less attractive for skilled labor and investment.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.3.4. Pro: Even slight increases in income tax lead to massive [revenue](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/17/business/putting-numbers-to-a-tax-increase-for-the-rich.html?_r=0) increases.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.3.5. Con: The divided nature of the United States today makes it unlikely that such a proposal will even make it past the legislative houses.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.3.5.1. Pro: About [half of both houses](https://www.atr.org/pledge-database) of the American Congress have signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, thereby vowing to oppose any and all tax increases.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.3.5.2. Pro: The plans for tax reform under debate by the [President](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-revised-tax-plan/full) as well as the [House Republicans](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-house-gop-tax-plan/full) would both lead to massive falls in federal revenue. Tax raises are definitely not on the agenda in Washington for now.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.4. Pro: The U.S. can shift its discretionary spending, for example, by slashing its [disproportionately large](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States) defense spending.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.5. Pro: As a percentage of GDP, the U.S.'s [current](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-budget) deficit is well in line with historical norms. Thus, additional deficit spending on one-time projects such as reparations is feasible.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.4. Con: The US is on track to increase its federal debt to nearly [$30 trillion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216998/forecast-of-the-federal-debt-of-the-united-states/) anyway. There is thus no reason to single out reparations as the main target for debt concerns.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.4.1. Con: America is desperately trying to cut its budget deficit. Adding additional expenses certainly will not help this effort.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.4.2. Con: This is merely a projection. As the [debt ceiling-crisis of 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt-ceiling_crisis_of_2013) illustrated, there is little political will to raise the nation's debt ever more. That Congress will be under Republican control for the coming four years will emphasize this.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.4.2.1. Con: The current president's administration has already brought up among [congressmen](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/us/politics/house-vote-harvey-aid-debt-ceiling.html?mtrref=undefined) the possibility of raising the debt ceiling to a higher amount.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.8. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.7.3.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.10. Con: The willingness to pay a significant, notable amount of money that requires cuts elsewhere would emphasize the importance of this step for the United States.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.10.1. Pro: If reparations are not significant enough, they can be interpreted as hush money meant to bury the issue and its contemporary reverberations.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.10.1.1. Con: Germany has paid more than [66 billion euros](https://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2015/summer/germany-japan-reconciliation/) in reparations to various other countries. These payments are part of a larger effort at reconciliation that has generally been judged as genuine and successful.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.10.1.1.1. Con: The compensations paid out to the victims of the Nazi-era during the period of Germany's rearmament in the 1950s have been interpreted as "political hush money" with the goal of soothing domestic opposition \([Pross, p. 174](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Pi-oZc7-P9AC&pg=PA174&lpg=PA174&dq=germany+%22hush+money%22+israel&source=bl&ots=X0sWcvbfR7&sig=S7bEhmI6swuo8qmUfJq9KR0gNN0&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiVuMahy8DQAhWGjpQKHWYEDCoQ6AEIRDAG#v=onepage&q=germany%20%22hush%20money%22%20israel&f=false)\).
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.10.1.2. Con: While this may be the case for payments that are not accompanied by sincere apologies and expressions of remorse, there is no principled reason why payments should not be part of an apology.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.10.1.3. Pro: History knows many examples of one state actor paying another state or a group of individuals, and of this act being interpreted as a bribe in exchange for silence.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.10.1.3.1. Pro: The compensation paid by Japanese government to Korean women who were forced into sex slavery during the Second World War has been interpreted as hush money meant to take a stain off Japan's international image \([Engert, p. 234](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=HONzCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT221&lpg=PT221&dq=japan+korea+hush+money&source=bl&ots=_AW_-kDLm4&sig=UxGQ2TPtFhVOrEdTnAsHsQrWA8s&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiNxo2UysDQAhUFUrwKHTJECLYQ6AEIQjAG#v=onepage&q=japan%20korea%20hush%20money&f=false)\)
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.10.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.10.1.1.1.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.10.2. Con: The effectiveness of reparations is not determined by how seriously it distresses the paying party but how settlements are understood by the former victims.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.10.2.1. Con: Reparations that Black Americans would understand as significant and sufficient would likely impose significant distress on the US as a whole.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.6. Con: Awarding reparations will cause major inflation due to the numerous sums awarded to those affected by slavery.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.6.1. Con: Large parts of the money paid out as reparations would most likely be taken away from other spending programs, thus not increasing the total supply of money and causing inflation.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.6.1.1. Con: If paid, reparations would likely cost billions. Congress has a hard time coming up with a budget for things already in the budget. There is no reason to assume they could magically find spare billions. Thus, reparations would either cause new taxes or they'd increase the national debt and deficit -- any of those options would negatively affect the economy.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.6.1.1.1. Con: There is no [evidence](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2017/11/08/federal-debt-is-reaching-20-trillion-and-i-dont-care/#6b2ae38832ba) either the debt or the deficit is a problem.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.7. Con: Shifting money from some citizens to other citizens doesn't do anything for the economy as a whole.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.7.1. Con: Keynsian economics absolutely does work when the money is taken from a group that intends to store the money \(e.g. the most wealthy\) to a group that intends to circulate and spend the money \(e.g. working class people\).
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.7.1.1. Con: This may be true, but reparations would be paid out of the federal treasury and thus paid using money confiscated from ALL citizens, not just those who intend to store the money.  This negates any benefit to the economy that may or may not be gained by redistributing the wealth held by those who intend to store their wealth.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.7.1.2. Con: Wealthy people do not store money in an unproductive way. They invest it, which makes these funds available to other people who need capital \(ie small business owners, start up companies, etc\)
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.7.1.2.1. Con: The assertion is very absolute, and the distinction between investing and storing money is not clear. When someone buys a very expensive home or yacht, the impact of that property on anyone's productivity is very questionable.
1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.7.1.2.1.1. Con: An investment like a home or yacht may employ a great number of people, from builders/designers, to repair or maintenance personnel, to staff and travel brokers.
1.2.13.1.1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.4.
1.2.13.1.1.6.4. Con: Equality in the United States exists [merely on paper](http://inequality.stanford.edu/publications/20-facts-about-us-inequality-everyone-should-know).
1.2.13.1.1.6.5. Con: Reparations would help bring equality to the disparity in financial status between white and Black Americans, thus upholding the equality principle.
1.2.13.1.1.6.5.1. Pro: The wealth of white families is growing at [three times](http://www.ips-dc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/The-Ever-Growing-Gap-CFED_IPS-Final-2.pdf) \(p. 5\) the pace of that of Black families; over the past 25 years the wealth gap between them [has tripled](https://iasp.brandeis.edu/pdfs/Author/shapiro-thomas-m/racialwealthgapbrief.pdf) \(p. 1\).
1.2.13.1.1.6.5.1.1. Con: Given that legal discrimination has been outlawed for decades, it is unlikely that the racial wealth gap is due to slavery.
1.2.13.1.1.6.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.2.
1.2.13.1.1.6.5.3. Con: A focus on financial matters misses the core of the issue. Financial disparities are merely a symptom; treating the symptoms ignores the cause.
1.2.13.1.1.6.5.3.1. Pro: Researchers have cautioned that it is necessary to focus on inequality in society as a whole instead of only on poverty \([Carter/Reardon, p. 13](https://ed.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/inequalitymatters.pdf)\).
1.2.13.1.1.6.5.3.2. Pro: Recommendations that aim at solving the inequality problem between white and Black America usually do not include the payout of money \([Shapiro et al, p. 6](https://iasp.brandeis.edu/pdfs/Author/shapiro-thomas-m/racialwealthgapbrief.pdf)\).
1.2.13.1.1.6.5.3.2.1. Con: Given the apparent lack of political will to address these issues in the status quo, perhaps it makes sense to improve short term standing.
1.2.13.1.1.6.5.3.2.1.1. Con: This approach can be interpreted as the endorsement of short-term solutions without any long-term benefit - and thus as a waste of money.
1.2.13.1.1.6.5.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.13.2.1.3.
1.2.13.1.1.6.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.8.1.
1.2.13.1.1.6.6. Con: The equality principle is routinely violated. Based generally on wealth, certain citizens have access to legal structures which grant them exclusive financial benefits already.
1.2.13.1.1.7. Con: The government already has discriminated in a variety of ways, often negatively based on race. What actually is being done needs to be factored into the discussion.
1.2.13.1.1.7.1. Con: Past offences do not justify future offences. "An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind".
1.2.13.1.1.8. Con: It is too late for this argument. The United States already institutionally discriminates against minorities in almost every area most importantly in housing, employment, and health care.
1.2.13.1.1.8.1. Con: The [laws of the United States](http://civilrights.findlaw.com/discrimination/race-discrimination-applicable-laws.html), including the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Title 42, clearly enshrine non-discrimination as a federal institutional principle.
1.2.13.1.1.8.2. Con: Even if the US government discriminated on the basis on race in the past, the way forward should be to create a color blind society.
1.2.13.1.1.8.2.1. Con: Creating a color-blind society ignores the reality that people of different races are treated differently in the US now.
1.2.13.1.1.8.2.1.1. Con: A color-blind society only avoids taking race into consideration when judging a person. It can still address racism by judging actions.
1.2.13.1.1.8.2.1.1.1. Con: We have to take into account people's race and background when we interact with people. It's part of what makes people who they are.
1.2.13.1.1.8.2.1.2. Pro: The term "color blind" with regard to race is itself a tool of discrimination, used to mask the unequal treatment of People of Color via superficial claims of equality before the law. In reality, PoCs face discrimination at every step of the legal process, with statistically higher rates of arrest, being charged, going to trial, and more extensive sentencing, when compared with whites accused of the same crimes. This is before even taking into account the higher rates of police brutality.
1.2.13.1.1.8.2.2. Con: A color-blind society ignores the differences in culture and experience between people of different races.
1.2.13.1.1.8.2.3. Con: The US government cannot create a society. It actively harmed the people through segregation, millions of which are still alive today. As with any crime, it's not enough to discontinue the negative behavior, instead it is paramount to try to compensate the victim or to punish the perpetrator. This principle shouldn't be ignored, even when dealing with the state.
1.2.13.1.1.9. Con: This argument might have more force if it had kicked in in 1619 \(when the first slaves were brought into the territory that would become the United States\) or even 1789 \(when the Constitution was ratified\). To ignore hundreds of years of discrimination and then cry about the treatment of white people is a mockery of justice.
1.2.13.1.1.9.1. Con: This discriminates against many racial groups, many of which themselves have been the victims of discrimination.
1.2.13.1.1.9.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.1.2.1.
1.2.13.1.1.9.1.2. Con: The proposal doesn't claim to be a remedy for discrimination at all, but to be a remedy for the institution of slavery as it was practiced in the United States.
1.2.13.1.1.9.2. Con: It does not change the basic principle that any form of racial discrimination is wrong, whether towards blacks or whites.
1.2.13.1.1.10. Pro: All positive discrimination towards one group on the basis of race is negative discrimination against other groups. Therefore all racial discrimination is negative.
1.2.13.1.1.10.1. Con: If we assume that, for instance, White people are advantaged over Black people, then discrimination to favor Black people to make them equal to White people only hurts White people insofar as it returns White people to equality. No group deserves to be treated any better than any other, meaning that a group is not "hurt" if they are forced to be equal.
1.2.13.1.1.10.1.1. Con: One cannot create "equal" through human intervention. This claim assumes we can easily recognize when equality is reached and maintain that status quo immediately. But society at large determines the status quo, and as soon as we have a sea change towards one side, we will overstep, giving advantage to the other side. Balance is not designed. It is an organic outcome of societal forces.
1.2.13.1.1.10.2. Pro: Discrimination is the key here. In attempting to restore balance through discrimination, we introduce imbalance. As soon as one party has an advantage, we begin to discriminate against them until some other party gains the upper hand. It's impossible to achieve balance this way.
1.2.13.1.1.11. Pro: There are just as many under-privileged White Americans as there are under-privileged Americans of every other ethnic background combined. [53%](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/) of Americans below the poverty line are white.
1.2.13.1.1.11.1. Con: The poverty rate for Black people in the US is [more than twice](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Total%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D) the poverty rate for White people.
1.2.13.1.1.11.2. Con: Yet white Americans, as a whole, already profit from positive discrimination. For decades the poverty rate of white Americans has been [lower](https://www.irp.wisc.edu/faqs/faq3.htm) than that of any other ethnicity in the United States.
1.2.13.1.1.12. Con: While it is true that slavery was based on race, reparations can be based on historical facts and heritage. You could say that anyone being enslaved during the transatlantic slave trade \(including all ethnicities\) should have access to reparation.
1.2.13.1.1.13. Con: Affirmative Action in the US is an example of successful "positive discrimination" policy.
1.2.13.1.1.13.1. Con: Affirmative action may stigmatise hardworking people who belong to a minority, with the notion of their success being solely due to positive discrimination only.
1.2.13.1.1.13.2. Con: When this is introduced into a system, people may become mismatched with a job title that requires them to work beyond their faculties or capabilities that positive discrimination cannot take into account.
1.2.13.1.1.13.3. Pro: [Affirmative action helps redress the ongoing effects of past racial injustices.](https://www.kialo.com/affirmative-action-useful-once-outdated-today-1715/1715.0=1715.1-1715.4)
1.2.13.1.1.14. Con: This argument falsely presumes that financial reparations constitute new discrimination as opposed to a mere correction for the already-existing systemic effects of prior discrimination. Consider a robbed man seeking his money back in court: he's no thief, even though he seeks money by force. Only the first taking theft; the second is not. It's just a correction. So too here. Imagine the government takes $1 from every white citizen. That's discrimination. Giving those dollars back later is not.
1.2.13.1.1.14.1. Con: In this example, the thief would first need to prove with specificity who was responsible for robbing him. Appealing to systemic injustice lacks the specificity necessary to identify a perpetrator, and thus violates the presumption of innocence. Individuals would be penalized as perpetrators without being first proven guilty.
1.2.13.1.1.15. Pro: Public opinion supports the notion that the government should not discriminate based on race.
1.2.13.1.1.15.1. Pro: [Two-thirds](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163655/reject-considering-race-college-admissions.aspx) of American adults oppose taking race into account for the purpose of college admissions; even among Black Americans as many oppose as support it.
1.2.13.1.1.15.1.1. Con: Depending on the phrasing of the question, other surveys produce different results. The American public [supports](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/22/public-strongly-backs-affirmative-action-programs-on-campus/) the provision of advantages to disadvantaged individuals in other areas, for example affirmative action in the context of college admissions for Black and minority students.
1.2.13.1.1.16. Pro: If we don't stop focusing on black and white, we'll never stop focusing on black and white. The only people who want us to focus on identity over unity are the ones who benefit from it.
1.2.13.1.1.16.1. Con: All people very much focus on [identity](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/1/17066702/identity-politics-trump-gop-conservatives?utm_campaign=vox.social&utm_content=voxdotcom&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook).
1.2.13.1.1.16.2. Con: It is unclear why a group facing systemic discrimination would want unity.
1.2.13.1.1.16.3. Con: Unity benefits those with power at the expense of those without. The only people who focus on unity over identity are ones who benefit from maintaining the status quo.
1.2.13.1.1.16.3.1. Con: Unity strengthens solidarity, thus making it more likely that those at the top care about those at the bottom.
1.2.13.1.1.16.4. Con: It is impossible to have unity without addressing the racist ways we have treated and continue to treat Black people in the US.
1.2.13.1.1.17. Pro: A wealth redistribution program from rich to poor would have a similar impact on black americans as reparations, without excluding other groups.
1.2.13.1.1.18. Pro: Benefits and support should be given out based on individual need or merit, such as welfare provisions, not because an individual happens to be of a certain race.
1.2.13.1.1.18.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.2.
1.2.13.1.1.18.2. Con: Reparations need not be considered a form of benefit or support, but rather a form of redress. In this context, belonging to a certain race is a legitimate criterion.
1.2.13.1.1.18.3. Con: The welfare state is a permanent institution, whereas reparations would come in the form of a one-time payment. This makes a direct comparison flawed.
1.2.13.1.1.18.4. Con: While the above claim is theoretically correct, administering reparations one individual at a time would be tremendously expensive and time consuming. If the person making the claim is willing to shoulder that bill personally, that is fine, but otherwise, delaying justice just because it is in bulk and not particularized is injustice.
1.2.13.1.1.18.4.1. Con: If we assume the phrase "in bulk" to mean "based on a characteristic which has a relatively high correlation with merit for reparations, without actually determining if merit exists in each individual circumstance," then this reasoning would itself lead to injustice: many without merit for such reparations but possessing the correlating characteristic would receive them, while many meriting such reparations but not possessing the correlating characteristic would not receive them.
1.2.13.1.1.18.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.3.
1.2.13.1.2. Con: In the legal system, we give recompense to people indirectly harmed by criminal actions.
1.2.13.1.2.1. Pro: For example, compensation for the indirect harm of "trouble and upset" is a standard feature in compensation for businesses' misbehaviour, for example, in [financial ombudsman awards](http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/publications/technical_notes/distress-and-inconvenience.htm).
1.2.13.1.2.2. Pro: For example, compensation for the indirect harm of "injury to feelings" is a standard feature in [workplace discrimination compensation awards](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/problems-at-work/employment-tribunals-from-29-july-2013/employment-tribunals-valuing-a-claim/compensation-for-discrimination/employment-tribunals-discrimination-calculating-compensation-for-injury-to-feelings/).
1.2.13.1.2.3. Con: There is no provision for giving recompense for indirect harm that happened more than two generations ago.
1.2.13.1.2.3.1. Con: In 2013, New Zealand [agreed to pay reparations](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/05/201352417347523932.html) for its treatment of the Maori people some 150 years earlier.
1.2.13.1.2.4. Pro: We compensate families of people who died because of the fault of another. Even though they were not directly harmed themselves, they were harmed by the loss of the loved one. Insofar as the indirect impacts of slavery are still felt in society, the Black community deserves recompense.
1.2.13.1.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.8.
1.2.13.1.3. Pro: Further, it would penalize a segment of society that had nothing to do with the perpetuation of slavery for the acts of people who might be distant, unknown ancestors or not related to them at all.
1.2.13.2. Pro: The cost of reparations would be borne by taxpayers indiscriminately, without any clear link with the perpetrators of slavery.
1.2.13.2.1. Pro: Some [13%](http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/09/28/chapter-5-u-s-foreign-born-population-trends/) of the American population is foreign-born and thus has no link to the evils of American slavery at all. They are not even descendants of those who lived in the United States during the times of slavery.
1.2.13.2.2. Pro: There are no more former slaves or slaveowners alive, nor anyone who witnessed the system. This marks a break with the past.
1.2.13.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.
1.2.13.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.2.1.
1.2.13.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.
1.2.13.2.2.4. Pro: Requiring compensation from individuals who are not guilty of the crime in question relies on and perpetuates the same ethical failures as slavery itself. It is a claim to authority over the productive output of others without their consent.
1.2.13.2.2.4.1. Con: Current productive output is tied up with accumulated capital and wealth. To the extent that this accumulated capital and wealth was derived from past injustices, it is not unethical for them to be appropriated to remediate them.
1.2.13.2.2.4.2. Con: The moral wrongs of slavery are not merely the expropriation of labor, but also the brutal and violent practices that enforced that expropriation. Here, the analogy fails.
1.2.13.2.2.4.2.1. Con: There are many additional moral wrongs associated with slavery, but slavery itself is the expropriation of labor. In fact, [Frederick Douglass](https://mises.org/blog/taxation-slavery-and-consent) and many others lived relatively autonomously aside from the confiscation of their income, showing the evolution of slavery as brutality decreased in order to facilitate greater productivity.
1.2.13.2.2.5. Pro: A main principle of reparations is to restore the original status \(status quo ante\) by returning to the victims what was lost \(restitutio in integrum\). Because the victims are long dead, this is not possible with with slavery and therefore reparation claims become void \([Moffett, p. 6](http://ecpr.eu/filestore/paperproposal/14d84c59-1767-467b-814c-0d57e7404655.pdf)\).
1.2.13.2.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.
1.2.13.2.2.5.2. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.2.
1.2.13.2.2.5.3. Pro: The centuries-long effects of the African [diaspora](https://oldwayspt.org/traditional-diets/african-heritage-diet/african-diaspora-cultures) and the development of the American economy through slave labor renders restoration to initial status impossible. This suggests that reparations is not the best approach to redress the wrongs these caused.
1.2.13.2.2.5.3.1. Con: Slavery usually consisted of at a minimum unpaid physical labour and often caused wrongful death. Both of these have legal monetary values which were denied to the families of enslaved peoples and could be restored to their descendants in some form.
1.2.13.2.3. Con: Debts are inherited, and this is a collective debt that has gone unpaid.
1.2.13.2.4. Con: The link is that they have been fortunate enough to be inhabitants of a wealthy, developed democracy that became rich off the back of the immoral practice of slavery. On the other hand, African Americans were the exploited labour and also the subsequent victims of ingrained racism. It's very difficult to understand why reparations have not yet been made.
1.2.13.2.4.1. Con: If simply inhabiting the country is the link, then today's African Americans are benefiting from the slavery of their ancestors just as much as everyone else.
1.2.13.2.5. Pro: Not only would the cost of reparations not be imposed on the perpetrators - it would, at least partially, be imposed on those who are being compensated. As African-Americans make up [13%](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/00) of the US population, a share of the compensations would inevitably come from their tax payments.
1.2.13.2.5.1. Pro: If it is assumed that slavery has negatively affected Black Americans today \(which reparations does assume\), it is nonsensical to make Black Americans pay for a crime that they were the victims of.
1.2.13.2.5.2. Con: Black Americans pay taxes regardless of whether reparations are paid. Currently, their tax payments are used to support other policies, so reallocating that money to reparations would still directly improve the situation of Black Americans.
1.2.13.2.5.3. Con: Some reparations could be paid in the form of tax credits, in order to avoid this problem.
1.2.13.2.6. Pro: Punishing taxpayers for something they did not do is unfair.
1.2.13.2.6.1. Con: The imposition of taxes is no punishment and is not based on what common goods taxpayers actually consume. By the same logic, one could argue that the building of highways with tax-payer money is unfair towards people who do not have a driver's license.
1.2.13.2.6.2. Con: Reparations are not punishment in the sense of retribution. Hence, moral culpability is not the primary issue.
1.2.13.3. Pro: Not all US citizens during slavery owned slaves. America as a whole can therefore hardly be at fault.
1.2.13.3.1. Con: The majority continued to vote for politicians who supported the ongoing existence of slavery for many years. In some states, the majority supported a civil war to defend the institution. This makes them responsible for it.
1.2.13.3.2. Con: In some states, the percentage of white households that owned slaves was as high as 44% \(as of 1790\) and even higher later on \([Census](https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/00165897ch14.pdf), p. 135\).
1.2.13.3.2.1. Con: This number refers to a single area - West Virginia and Virginia - which is not representative for the United States as a whole. Excluding this case, and in the same year, less than 12% of families across America owned slaves \([Census, p. 135](https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/00165897ch14.pdf)\).
1.2.13.3.2.2. Con: This is misleading as slavery was, nevertheless, a regionally focused phenomenon. Throughout the history of slavery in the US \(in 1790 as well as in 1850\), the Southern States [accounted for over 90%](https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/00165897ch14.pdf) of all slaves held.
1.2.13.3.2.3. Con: Even in that State, the majority of white households did not own slaves. \(And among those who did, the injustices of slavery were not spread evenly... most slaves were held, and harmed, by relatively few large plantation owners\).
1.2.13.3.3. Pro: Technically only 17.2% of American households in 1790 owned slaves \([Census, p. 135](https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/00165897ch14.pdf)\).
1.2.13.3.3.1. Con: It is reasonable to assume that a far larger share of Americans profited from or utilized slaves in one way or another, for example by employing the services of businesses that used slaves for labor.
1.2.13.3.3.1.1. Con: It doesn't seem fair to say that someone who "profited from or benefitted in some way or another" from slavery is equally culpable as someone who actually bought, kept, beat, and killed humans as slaves.
1.2.13.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Equal culpability is not required for reparations to be appropriate --- shared responsibility is sufficient. And it is fair to say that a far larger portion of society had shared responsibility for the institution of slavery than simply slave owners.
1.2.13.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Responsibility is a [synonym of culpability](http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/culpability). But if you are talking about the nuance between the connotations of the two, then in the context of being required to pay damages, culpable is the more-relevant term because it has connotations of legal liability.
1.2.13.3.3.2. Con: While the percentages for slave ownership vary with time and location, they are high enough that it is reasonable to assume that most white Americans with American ancestry have at least one slave-owning ancestor.
1.2.13.3.3.2.1. Con: The descendants of slavers carry no responsibility, as they took no part in what their ancestors did.
1.2.13.3.3.2.1.1. Con: The descendants currently share in the financial wealth resulting from slavery so they should definitely share in the punishment too.
1.2.13.3.3.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.13.2.3.
1.2.13.3.4. Pro: As of 1860, more than 70% of America's free population lived in states in which slavery was already outlawed and which [had no slaves](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html).
1.2.13.3.4.1. Con: These states had slavery prior to that point. To look at the percentage of slave ownership in these states after it was banned is misleading.
1.2.13.3.5. Con: According to the census of 1790, [almost 18%](https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/00165897ch14.pdf) of the American population were enslaved; in 1860 this share still stood [at 13%](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html). In one form or another, many more Americans therefore profited from slave labor than the relatively small minority that owned slaves.
1.2.13.3.5.1. Pro: This share jumps to [34%](https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/00165897ch14.pdf) among the Southern states of 1790 and [almost 39%](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html) in the Confederate states of 1860.
1.2.13.3.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.3.3.1.
1.2.13.3.5.3. Con: -> See 1.2.13.3.4.
1.2.13.3.5.4. Con: At the same time, some non-enslaved Americans also were harmed by slavery, since they had to compete against farms and enterprises which unfairly benefited from slave labor.
1.2.13.3.6. Con: -> See 1.2.13.3.3.2.
1.2.13.3.7. Con: At the same time, this majority profited passively from slavery and did not actively oppose it, thereby sanctioning its existence.
1.2.13.3.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.3.5.
1.2.13.3.8. Pro: The burden for reparations should fall directly on the families that built their fortunes off of slavery rather than the general American public.
1.2.13.3.9. Con: America's wealth as a country, not just the wealth of individuals, was built on slavery. The economic system through trade within the nation benefited all free people with cheap goods supplied by slavery, and cheap goods being exported increased the wealth of the nation internationally.
1.2.13.3.9.1. Con: The argument could be made that many other countries also benefited from slavery in America; if these countries are removed by the nth degree, then the arguments made to recuse today's American citizenry are just as valid.
1.2.13.3.10. Pro: The people paying for reparations may not be morally culpable for slavery. Indeed, their ancestors may have fought and died to free slaves.
1.2.13.3.11. Pro: Perhaps it would be more appropriate to look into shipping companies that brought the slaves over in the first place rather than to punish people who fought a war to free slaves.
1.2.14. Con: This arguement is hard to agree with as the foundation of the United States was surrounded by slavery. The White House itself was builtin part by slaves. Several Presidents owned slaves, the politicians in early American history were predominantly white male slave owners.
[www.whitehousehistory.org](https://www.whitehousehistory.org/press-room/press-fact-sheets/slavery-and-the-white-house)
1.2.15. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.2.2.
1.2.16. Con: Current economic imbalances provide the historic link: If slaves had been allowed to possess and retain the profits of their labor, their descendants might now control a much larger share of American social and monetary [wealth](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/U.S.+apology+for+slavery--apparently+not+front+page+news.-a0188352184).
1.2.16.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.8.2.
1.2.16.2. Con: [70% of family wealth is lost by the second generation. 90% of family wealth is lost by the third generation](http://time.com/money/3925308/rich-families-lose-wealth/). There have been over two generations since the Civil Rights Act, and over 6 since the Emancipation Proclamation \(which would mean 99%+ of family wealth from that time is gone\). Over time, the effects of past advantages trend downward \(toward zero\), not upward.
1.2.16.3. Pro: Many [social programs](http://www.crf-usa.org/brown-v-board-50th-anniversary/reparations-for-slavery-reading.html), though well-intentioned, also increased Black isolation and further degraded the Black community.
1.2.16.4. Con: The wars and recessions of the past 150 years have reshuffled wealth to a degree that makes it difficult to draw a line from slavery to contemporary economic imbalances.
1.2.16.4.1. Con: Studies of the 2008 recession show that it financially hurt people across the board, yet those who were already in a disadvantaged position \(and especially Black Americans\) suffered disproportionally. Existing inequalities were therefore further cemented and wealth not reshuffled \([Wolff/Owens/Burak Ho](http://commons.ln.edu.hk/sw_master/3255/); [Pfeffer/Danziger/Schoeni](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4200506/)\).
1.2.16.5. Con: -> See 1.2.2.8.2.1.
1.2.17. Con: Continuous claims for reparations illustrate its persistence in social dialogue and preserved its relevance until today.
1.2.17.1. Pro: The 1896-founded [National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ex-Slave_Mutual_Relief,_Bounty_and_Pension_Association) marks the first stage of demands right after the abolition of slavery.
1.2.17.2. Pro: The demands put forward by [Queen Mother Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Mother_Moore) between the 1920s and 1960s fell in the period of time in which first-hand witnesses were dying.
1.2.17.3. Pro: Since the 1960s there have been several reparation demand groups, such as the [Republic of New Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_New_Afrika) or the [National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Coalition_of_Blacks_for_Reparations_in_America).
1.2.17.4. Pro: In 1781, Anthony Vassall petitioned the Massachusetts legislature for reparations \([Finkenbine, p. 101](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4491599?mag=how-an-ex-slave-successfully-won-case-reparations-1783&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\).
1.2.17.5. Con: Just because it's talked about socially doesn't make it morally relevant, technically accurate, and it doesn't add to its legitimacy as a claim. Claims aren't legitimized simply because they're made, just as these in debate aren't.
1.3. Pro: Reparations will improve the moral standing of the United States in the world.
1.3.1. Con: The United States is judged mostly on its contemporary and international politics, so this local effort to remedy a past grievance would not matter much in the community of nations.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Most nations have a past they are ashamed of and therefore are able to forgive the United States for slavery.
1.3.1.2. Pro: There are a number of good things that the US does today that can buy it enough goodwill around the world.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: Goodwill is neither fungible nor limited - this would buy the US goodwill among different groups and countries, and would buy more of it than the US would otherwise have.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: A nuclear umbrella is a more convincing argument than moral superiority to induce other countries to do what the US wants, because it is tangible.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Con: Given that power is issue-specific, [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power) gained through moral superiority can be more effective than a nuclear umbrella in things like trade deals.
1.3.1.3. Pro: There are a number of bad things that the United States does in the world today that can suffice to stain whatever moral stance reparation brings.
1.3.1.4. Con: What happens in the United States does matter to many countries in the world, for reasons of geopolitical and global stability.
1.3.1.5. Con: [Many](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/europe-sees-history-of-american-racism-in-trayvon-martin-killing/255362/) see the US as tarred by a history and modern trend of racism; this would be viewed as a rejection of and move against that problem.
1.3.2. Pro: African countries are likely to note reparations to Black Americans with approval.
1.3.2.1. Pro: In the context of what has been called a "[new scramble for Africa](http://isreview.org/issue/60/new-scramble-africa)," it would be in America's strategic interest to gain influence in the continent.
1.3.2.2. Con: Paying reparations to Black Americans makes it less likely that African countries receive US slavery reparations.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Domestic pressure leads to more spending to foreign countries. For example, US support to Israel is increased by a domestic [pro-Israel lobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Israel_Lobby_and_U.S._Foreign_Policy).
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Pressure on the US government to pay reparations to African nations will decrease.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: Many Black Americans will lose interest in the issue once they received domestic reparations.
1.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: The US government will be able to point to its repent and claim these two issues are not comparable. Germany, for example, points to its reparations for the Holocaust while dismissing claims by the Herero as "[incomparable](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/25/germany-moves-to-atone-for-forgotten-genocide-in-namibia)".
1.3.2.3. Pro: The [Nigerian Sun](http://www.nigeriasun.com/news/248043311/us-owes-blacks-reparations-over-slavery---un) reports positively of slavery reparations.
1.3.2.4. Pro: A partial reparation program in the US could help to push for a global reparation program, as hoped by some [South African](http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/2351) civil society groups and [CARICOM](http://www.caricom.org/reparations-for-native-genocide-and-slavery).
1.3.3. Pro: A UN Working Group report to the Human Rights Council urged the US to pay slavery reparations \([UN Report, p. 19](http://www.ushrnetwork.org/sites/ushrnetwork.org/files/unwgepad_us_visit_final_report_9_15_16.pdf)\). Complying with the demands will enhance the image of the US as following UN rules.
1.3.3.1. Con: The US violates UN processes and international law relatively frequently, such as invading other countries. Ignoring a Working Group report is a minor aspect in comparison.
1.3.3.2. Con: This presupposes that the United Nations holds - and ought to hold - moral and political sway over the United States. The moral approval of the UN is meaningless to the US.
1.3.3.3. Con: The report suggested that Congress  "pass H.R. 40 — the Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act — which would establish a commission ... and to recommend appropriate remedies" Reparatory justice need not necessarily mean Fiduciary or Monetary justice.
1.3.3.4. Con: The larger public has not taken notice of this report. It is therefore unlikely that complying with it will have much of an effect on America's image as a member of the UN.
1.3.4. Pro: Other countries have paid for similar grievances. The US shouldn't be different.
1.3.4.1. Pro: [Australia](http://www.statedevelopment.sa.gov.au/aboriginal-affairs/stolen-generations-reparations-scheme) has started paying reparations for members of the stolen generation.
1.3.4.2. Con: Other countries have usually paid reparations to victims who are still alive or their immediate descendants. This makes a comparison with the case of slavery reparations difficult.
1.3.4.3. Con: Several countries with similar historical blights on their record have not paid any reparations.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: Belgium has not paid any reparations for its genocides in the Congo.
1.3.4.3.1.1. Con: The situation here is different to many other cases as the Congo Free State was technically not a Belgian colony but instead [personally owned and ruled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium#Congo_Free_State) by Leopold II.
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: Britain hasn't paid any reparations for the harms of its colonial past.
1.3.4.3.3. Pro: Nigeria hasn't paid any reparations for its genocidal policies in the [Biafra War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Civil_War).
1.3.4.3.4. Con: The fact that not all countries have paid reparations is less relevant than the fact some countries have.
1.3.4.4. Pro: Japan has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in reparations for the women from other Asian countries it exploited as [sex slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_women) before and during World War II.
1.3.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.2.3.1.
1.3.4.6. Con: United States policy should not focus on whether or not they are different or are in lockstep with other countries. We should strive for objectively moral policies; the actions of other nations are irrelevant in that context.
1.3.4.6.1. Pro: A big part of American culture and perhaps one of the forces in its rise as a world power has been the principle that your own choices have the power to impact your life for good. This emphasis on the power of good choices to overcome adverse situations decreases the relative importance of policies designed to even out disadvantages.
1.3.5. Pro: Paying reparations will provide a moral example to other nation-states with a similar past of abuse to reckon with their past through a similar kind of atonement.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Countries with vicious colonial histories like Germany or the United Kingdom or Belgium might be shamed into follow suit, and this will benefit other peoples.
1.3.5.2. Con: It doesn't follow that everyone will do it just because the US does. Just because Germany offered some payment for the Holocaust has not, for example, led Russia to pay reparations for crimes like the [Katyn massacre](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/winter99-00/art6.html).
1.3.5.3. Con: America's moral leadership in the world is [already in decline](http://www.rense.com/general73/roal.htm), so this expectation of followership is overstated.
1.3.5.4. Con: It is not the responsibility of any one nation to set an example against slavery when today there are more countries enslaving [more slaves](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19831913) than any other time in human history.
1.3.5.4.1. Con: On the contrary, the context of widespread modern slavery makes it all the more urgent for privileged and powerful nations to make clear just how morally wrong it is.
1.3.5.4.1.1. Con: The US already makes clear that it opposes modern day slavery. [Presidential proclamation](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/12/31/presidential-proclamation-national-slavery-and-human-trafficking) and [Presidential speeches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KzXcHZU4us) illustrate this.
1.3.5.4.1.1.1. Con: Facing up to domestic wrongs is a more powerful statement than indexes.
1.3.5.4.2. Con: There many more countries and more humans now than during the 19th century. Thus, a comparison focusing on absolute numbers misses the point.
1.3.5.4.3. Con: It may not be the responsibility of one nation to set an example against slavery, but doing so can send the message that slavery is wrong and unethical.
1.3.5.5. Pro: America has always ascribed itself a moral leadership role, as evident in tropes such as "[city upon a hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_upon_a_Hill#Use_in_American_politics)". A strong stance against slavery on the international level would fit that.
1.3.5.5.1. Pro: The American "desire for moral leadership" has been described as "something more than the ordinary narcissism and nationalism that all powerful states display" \([Ignatieff, p. 13](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=OUiZLQdGJwkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=American+Exceptionalism+and+Human+Rights&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_m6Pj14_TAhVKTrwKHUgTB_sQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=%22something%20more%20than%22&f=false)\).
1.3.5.5.2. Pro: Reconciliation has been described as one way to enhancing a country's international reputation and attraction by setting an admirable example, as the case of South Africa illustrates \([Chitty](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=vTVuDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT1&lpg=PT1&dq=The+Routledge+Handbook+of+Soft+Power&source=bl&ots=szUKOhNrhg&sig=tB8wEwTSmjUx6lnHaxDdFAMHfGI&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjzsI6v9c3QAhXBbbwKHQffCn8Q6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q=reconciliation&f=false)\).
1.3.6. Con: If the point of reparations is to improve the reputation of the US, then it is not moral at all because it is only for the United States' own selfish gains instead of truly attempting to aid and apologize to African Americans. And if other countries were to pick up on that, it would end up damaging reputation instead of improving it.
1.3.6.1. Con: The goals of reparations and possible positive effects from reparations are not the same things. They are not mutually exclusive and do not negate each other.
1.3.7. Con: Given the discrimination and unjust treatment that Black Americans still face and that the US government turns a blind eye to, reparations seems more like an cynical bribe that means little to Black Americans.
1.3.8. Con: Global moral standing as it exists today has no value for many or most in the USA.
1.3.9. Pro: The US values money above all other things, and they should therefore pay for their sins of the past. The slaves were used as labour. The persons who enforced the labour did not pay a fair market value, and used force to extract the labour from their homelands. The people of the day did little to effect a reasonable rule of law. They have incurred a debt to be repaid by later generations.
1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.
1.5. Pro: Reparations would benefit segments of society disadvantaged by the legacy of slavery.
1.5.1. Con: Reparations would profit Black Americans independent of wealth, social standing and class, thereby giving even more to those who are already well-off.
1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.5.
1.5.1.2. Con: Reparations represent a principled obligation to return what you have stolen. It doesn't matter how wealthy the person is: you should still return what you have stolen.
1.5.1.3. Pro: There are many [famous and wealthy](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alanamassey/celebs-with-slave-ancestry?utm_term=.ek0gkgPyE#.huwv9vEnB) Black Americans with slave ancestors, such as Oprah Winfrey or Morgan Freeman. They would equally receive benefits from reparations.
1.5.1.3.1. Con: This misrepresents reality. Of the top 1% of American households by income, [only 1.6%](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/antonio-moore/americas-financial-divide_b_7013330.html) are Black \(whereas the Black share of the population stands at 13%\).
1.5.1.4. Con: There are other government programs that are seen as alleviating poverty, even though they also benefit wealthy Americans. For example, [virtually all](https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf) elderly Americans receive social security benefits, but it is still [understood](http://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/social-security-keeps-22-million-americans-out-of-poverty-a-state-by-state) as alleviating poverty.
1.5.1.5. Con: Wealthy Black Americans may not be economically disadvantaged, but they still suffer the same social prejudices as poor Black Americans due to the effects of slavery.
1.5.1.5.1. Con: Reparations are insufficient to address non-economic discrimination.
1.5.1.5.2. Con: Although prejudice is deplorable, it is not clear that reparations are the most appropriate or effective means of redress.
1.5.1.5.3. Pro: Affluent Black Americans in Milwaukee face housing [segregation](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/us/milwaukee-segregation-wealthy-black-families.html?_r=0) despite having the finances and desire to relocate to a more upper-class neighborhood.
1.5.1.6. Pro: Among Black Americans, [17%](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/08/22/chapter-2-middle-class-demographics/) consider themselves members of the upper class. That is 6.4 million people who are probably not in need of financial support.
1.5.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.
1.5.1.6.2. Con: When asked to classify their socio-economic class, people routinely [fail to do so correctly](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/08/why-americans-all-believe-they-are-middle-class/278240/).
1.5.1.6.3. Con: This is somewhat misleading. Defining upper class as annual incomes of over $100.000, as is often done, 12.4% of Black Americans qualified \(compared to 28% of white Americans\) as of 2014 \([DeNavas-Walt/Proctor, p. 25, 27](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p60-252.pdf)\).
1.5.1.7. Pro: Many Black Americans have no need for financial support.
1.5.1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.6.
1.5.2. Con: There are better uses that the money could be put to in order to improve the lives of Black Americans.
1.5.2.1. Con: Spending on reparations isn't primarily about social utility, but about redressing past wrongs. Thus, its rightness or wrongness can't be evaluated by weighing it against social spending programs.
1.5.2.2. Pro: As Black Americans are notoriously disadvantaged, every policy that increases [social spending](https://academic.udayton.edu/race/02rights/repara35.htm) will be beneficial to them.
1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Black Americans are the [most likely](http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) racial group in the US to be living in poverty, therefore programs such as housing assistance and food stamps disproportionally help that community.
1.5.2.3. Con: Reparations could help boost the socioeconomic status of the US broadly, by offering Black Americans the means to uplift their financial status.
1.5.2.3.1. Con: Whether reparations benefit the United States as a whole should not be taken into consideration. After all, reparations are meant to benefit the victims of slavery, even though this comes at a cost to the country as a whole.
1.5.2.3.1.1. Con: Policy makers need to take into account the full effects their decisions have on the country as a whole.
1.5.2.3.1.2. Pro: Depicting the contribution to the nation's wealth as the prime objective of reparations once again subordinates individuals to the collective, just like slavery itself did.
1.5.2.3.1.2.1. Con: The problem with slavery isn't that it subordinated individuals to the collective. It's that it allowed some individuals to exercise brutal control over other individuals.
1.5.2.4. Pro: Race-neutral criminal justice reforms [may do a better job](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/bernie-sanders-right-on-reparations/426720/) of redressing past wrongs than reparations.
1.5.2.4.1. Pro: Race-neutral reforms would prevent the impression of an unfair distribution of benefits, which might further deepen the rifts in American society.
1.5.2.4.1.1. Pro: Those who would receive reparations would only have been affected indirectly by slavery. Given this, future generations of Black Americans could equally point out that they suffer from the legacy of slavery and claim reparations, thus creating a permanent line of racial division in the United States.
1.5.2.4.1.1.1. Con: Once reparations have been paid, the debt will be fulfilled.
1.5.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Assuming that reparations cannot instantaneously solve the structural inequalities that Black Americans suffer from, future generations have the same claim to reparations due to structural inequalities as the present generation.
1.5.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.3.
1.5.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.5.3.2.
1.5.2.4.3. Con: While this might be true on a socio-economic level, it probably does little to redress the emotional damage done to Black Americans as individuals and as a community.
1.5.2.5. Pro: In distributing tax payer money, the principle we should focus on is present need, rather than past injustice.
1.5.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.7.
1.5.2.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.
1.5.2.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.6.
1.5.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.
1.5.2.7. Pro: In the longer term, a functioning social safety net will be more important to disadvantaged minorities than a one-off payment of reparations.
1.5.2.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.2.1.
1.5.2.7.2. Pro: During the 2016 Presidential campaign [Bernie Sanders](http://time.com/4220542/bernie-sanders-reparations-race-forum/) argued that if the goal is to eliminate poverty, the better approach would be to invest directly in all poor communities, irrespective of race.
1.5.2.7.2.1. Con: This approach, which theorists such as Ta-Nehisi Coates have [called](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/bernie-sanders-reparations/424602/) "the 'class first' approach" simply assumes that racism is incompatible with socialism. In fact, class-based remedies wouldn't address many instances of racial inequality.
1.5.2.7.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.5.
1.5.2.7.3. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.4.
1.5.3. Pro: The continued racial income and [wealth gaps](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/12/racial-wealth-gaps-great-recession/) are traceable to [slavery and its aftermath](http://bernard.pitzer.edu/~hfairchi/pdf/Blacks/RacialWealthGap.pdf). Reparations reduce this disparity.
1.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.2.
1.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.8.1.
1.5.3.3. Con: Reparations are unlikely to be effective in the long run. A one-time payment can hardly compensate for the larger structural disadvantages that Black Americans suffer from.

1.5.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.1.
1.5.3.6. Pro: Money can be used to close the education gap by buying a better quality education or buying property - which can pass wealth down to future generations in the way that many Americans already benefit from. Both these things would make substantial inroads in eliminating structural disadvantages.
1.5.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.8.2.1.1.1.
1.5.3.6.2. Con: Money can also be used to buy cigarettes, liquor, drugs, guns, and lottery tickets. This is not meant to stereotype black people; it is meant to demonstrate that people of all races are prone to make poor decisions with their money. Reparations would help some people; it would do nothing or worsen the situation for others. Policy changes that improve access to education, healthcare, housing, and jobs are a much more cost-effective long-term solution.
1.5.3.6.2.1. Con: Behavioral problems mentioned above are [caused by poverty](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/how-poverty-affects-the-brain-and-behavior). The argument is backwards.
1.5.3.7. Con: The fact that [such a gap](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/12/racial-wealth-gaps-great-recession/) shrank in the nine years from 1989 to 1998 and grew from 2001 to 2014 seems to indicate that other issues besides slavery are driving that disparity.
1.5.3.8. Pro: The average Black family would need [228 Years](https://www.thenation.com/article/the-average-black-family-would-need-228-years-to-build-the-wealth-of-a-white-family-today/) to build the wealth of a White family today.
1.5.3.9. Con: Reparations for past injustices should not be handed out based on current economic inequalities.
1.5.3.9.1. Pro: If reparations would not be handed out today but be proposed again in a hypothetical future in which Black Americans are economically better off than other groups of Americans, they would suddenly be inappropriate based on this logic. Yet this can hardly be described as fitting the spirit of reparations.
1.5.3.10. Con: Just because certain groups of people work harder than the others, doesn't mean that group is favored by the society. If White people benefit so much because of slavery, then why do Asians are having [higher wage](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/) than them without the use of slaves?
1.5.3.10.1. Con: Comparing wages between Asian Americans and white Americans misses the point of the [wage gap studies](http://bernard.pitzer.edu/~hfairchi/pdf/Blacks/RacialWealthGap.pdf) that examined the impact of slavery has had on the wages of Black Americans as opposed to the American population as a whole.
1.5.3.11. Con: Income and wealth gaps are explained by multiple factors, and rewarding those stemming from race \(rather than, for instance, IQ or propensity to be afflicted by a particular disease\) arbitrarily privileges race over other characteristics.
1.5.3.12. Pro: The wealth gap [contributes](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/07/black_american_versus_african_american_why_i_prefer_to_be_called_a_black.html) to widespread inequality on a number of indices.
1.5.4. Pro: Black Americans experience substantial disadvantages in their lives in comparison to white Americans. Reparations would be a remedy.
1.5.4.1. Pro: [Poverty](https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2015/jan/05/rising-income-inequality-deadlier-for-black-americans-study) has been shown to lead to more deaths for Black Americans than white Americans. Reparations can decrease this structural inequality, thus reducing incidents of death due to poverty in the Black community.
1.5.4.2. Pro: [Crime and the incarceration](http://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1425&context=student_scholarship) of Black Americans are two of the structural problems. With reparations, Black Americans are less likely to commit crimes and end up incarcerated.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.13.2.1.2.
1.5.4.2.2. Con: Racial [bias](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-director-acknowledges-hard-truths-about-racial-bias-in-policing/2015/02/12/023c6c6e-b2c6-11e4-854b-a38d13486ba1_story.html?utm_term=.857a79453b47) is a problem in policing. To the extent that this is the case, reparations will not necessarily affect the problem of mass incarceration.
1.5.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.5.4.4. Pro: Paying reparations would likely foster investigation into what the effects of slavery have been. This would lead to a better awareness of the harmful structural factors.
1.5.4.5. Con: -> See 1.5.3.3.
1.5.4.6. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.5.3.2.
1.5.4.7. Con: -> See 1.5.2.
1.5.4.8. Con: -> See 1.1.13.2.1.
1.5.4.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.13.2.1.5.
1.5.4.10. Pro: In the US today, the average white high school dropout is [wealthier](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/10/white-high-school-dropouts-are-wealthier-than-black-and-hispanic-college-graduates-can-a-new-policy-tool-fix-that/?utm_term=.0a45f0269162) than the average Black college graduate.
1.5.5. Pro: Reparations would improve the societal standing of the Black community in the US.
1.5.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.13.2.1.5.
1.5.5.2. Con: Regardless of how they affect the societal standing of Black Americans, reparations will not stop the very real consequences of slavery from being constantly felt by the Black community.
1.5.5.2.1. Con: Reparations would help to close the emotional racial divide in the US.
1.5.5.2.1.1. Con: Paying reparations would absolve the current government and American people of responsibility for structural factors that still hurt the Black community.
1.5.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: Paying reparations would send the message that racism has been ended, that there are no longer any inequalities. This would eliminate any political will for dealing with biased law enforcement, housing discrimination, etc.
1.5.5.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Paying reparations sends the message that people feel guilty and believe the afflictions of the black community is due to historic discrimination.
1.5.5.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Even if the message is not that racism has ended, people will be less willing to address racism after spending money on reparations. They will feel as if they have sacrificed enough.
1.5.5.2.1.1.1.3. Con: Structured correctly, ongoing reparations could be used to incentivize society as a whole to take the initiative to correct the vast chasm of inequality as a way to sunset the ongoing reparations. An example could be reparation payments to Black Americans that prevail until the poverty rates of Black and white Americans have reached an equal level.
1.5.5.2.1.1.1.4. Con: Reparations would be one step of many in dissolving racial inequality, by acknowledging the injustice done.
1.5.5.2.1.1.2. Con: Even if the government was absolved, the Black community would still be in better financial standing writ large, and thus better off.
1.5.5.2.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.3.3.
1.5.5.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.5.3.2.1.
1.5.5.2.1.1.3. Con: Conversely, paying reparations could be seen as the government taking responsibility for these structural factors.
1.5.5.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: This could be used to hold them to account for fixing them.
1.5.5.2.1.1.3.2. Con: Having already paid reparations, the current government would have no impetus to address existing aspects of discrimination.
1.5.5.2.1.1.4. Con: It is only correct that the government be at least partially absolved when it has sincerely tried to tackle some aspects of structural disadvantage.
1.5.5.2.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.10.1.
1.5.5.2.1.1.6. Con: Many of the structural problems currently plaguing the Black community are directly solved by reparations.
1.5.5.2.1.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.13.2.1.
1.5.5.2.1.1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.13.2.1.5.
1.5.5.2.1.2. Pro: Reparations have the ability to cure the US' [post traumatic slave syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Traumatic_Slave_Syndrome).
1.5.5.2.1.2.1. Con: There is no evidence that reparations would cure this trauma. Evidence from the effects of compensation on recovery from PTSD does [not point](http://militarymedicine.amsus.org/doi/abs/10.7205/MILMED.172.10.1039) towards any beneficial effect.
1.5.5.2.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.5.5.2.1.2.3. Con: The concept [has been criticized](http://www.aaihs.org/post-traumatic-slave-syndrome-is-a-racist-idea/) for relying on mostly anecdotal evidence, only furthering the idea of inequality between the races, and arguing that Black Americans "need to be healed, civilized, developed", thus shifting the focus away from societal manifestations of racism.
1.5.5.2.1.3. Con: Reparations do not heal wounds. Rather, the acknowledgement of guilt and a plea for forgiveness does.
1.5.5.2.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.2.1.1.1.4.
1.5.5.2.1.3.2. Con: Merely acknowledging guilt does nothing to redress the disadvantaged financial position that the Black community is in relative to other Americans.
1.5.5.2.1.3.3. Con: According to the final report of the South Korean Truth Commission, financial reparations helped to restore "the honor of many of the victims and bereaved families" \([TRC, p. 102](http://www.dhnet.org.br/verdade/mundo/coreia/cv_11_coreia_do_sul.pdf)\).
1.5.5.2.1.3.4. Con: An apology without a commensurate sacrifice is hollow.
1.5.5.2.1.3.5. Con: Apologies without any other substantial, sustained action to improve the situation of marginalized groups, for example the payment of reparations, are likely to be viewed as a short-term [strategic political campaign effort](http://runnermag.ca/2016/04/government-apologies-need-follow-through-to-have-impact/) and not genuine
1.5.5.2.1.3.5.1. Pro: The National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America \([N'COBRA](http://www.crf-usa.org/brown-v-board-50th-anniversary/reparations-for-slavery-reading.html)\) demands not only money but land, ownership of companies and even self-government for Black Americans.
1.5.5.2.1.3.6. Con: Reparations acknowledge that Black Americans were in fact victims who continue to experience the effects of slavery.
1.5.5.2.1.3.7. Pro: The South African Truth and Reconciliation Comission was able to contribute to the healing of emotional wounds by acknowledgement rather than reparations \([Gunter-Hault, p. x](https://bookstore.usip.org/sites/usip/resrcs/chapters/1929223099_otherchap.pdf)\).
1.5.5.2.1.3.7.1. Pro: The effects of the commission were judged to be relatively successful and positive for South African society across all major ethnic groups \([Vora and Vora, p. 309](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3180939?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\).
1.5.5.2.1.3.7.2. Pro: The commission was able to generate a narrative that is widely accepted \([Gibson, p. 124](http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1522&context=lcp)\). Given that competing historical narratives often obstruct reconciliation this is a major contribution.
1.5.5.2.1.3.8. Con: The relative success of the [Chilean](http://www.beyondintractability.org/casestudy/brahm-chilean) Truth and Reconciliation Commission was linked to later financial compensation.
1.5.5.2.1.3.8.1. Con: In the case of the Chilean Truth and Reconciliation commission, the financial compensation was for relatively recent events. This makes the analogy to reparations, where the financial compensation would be for distant events, suspect.
1.5.5.2.1.4. Con: The emotional racial divide exists as a result of on-going structural and societal discrimination against Black Americans. Reparations for slavery do not directly address this issue.
1.5.5.2.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.5.3.2.
1.5.5.2.1.5. Pro: Paying reparations would be as cleansing for those outside the African community as within.
1.5.5.2.1.6. Pro: Paying reparations is a positive step toward healing the division between the races. Acknowledging a wrong and apologizing with paying reparations is a positive step forward.
1.5.5.2.1.7. Con: Reparations might entrench divisions as many Americans would take issue with the idea of paying for injustices they have no connection to for the benefit of people who equally don't have any link to these injustices.
1.5.5.2.1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.2.2.
1.5.5.2.1.7.2. Con: By that reasoning the government \(municipal, state or federal\)  should never settle law suits where there has been negligence or harm done by the state since most citizens had no role in the negligence.
1.5.5.2.1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.2.
1.5.5.2.1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.
1.5.5.2.1.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.
1.5.5.2.1.8. Pro: Reparations recognize the dignity of descendants of those who most likely experienced slavery.
1.5.5.2.1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.13.3.
1.5.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.4.1.
1.5.5.2.3. Pro: The institutional effects of racism have done much damage over the years that one set of expenditures will not be able to undo.
1.5.5.2.4. Pro: What slavery did was to dehumanize a group of people. Paying their descendants will do nothing to bring back that humanization.
1.5.5.3. Con: -> See 1.5.5.2.1.1.
1.5.5.4. Pro: Reparations would be supportive of a broader effort by Black Americans to draw attention to their central place in American history and culture.
1.5.5.4.1. Pro: Reparations would help Black Americans to see themselves as part of America's national narrative.
1.5.5.4.1.1. Con: Attitude to one's country can't be based on just one issue. Paying reparations will not suddenly make anyone immediately positive about the country if they weren't before.
1.5.5.4.1.2. Con: Reparations would be unlikely to overcome the complex system of disadvantages and prejudices that currently prevents Black Americans from perceiving themselves as part of America's national narrative.
1.5.5.4.1.3. Pro: Showing African-American citizens that the country understands the struggles they went through by rewarding them, in some way, for that pain, would allow for more nationalistic attitudes.
1.5.5.4.1.3.1. Pro: People can be [taught](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miroslav_Hroch) to love their country, and can love it more if their historical hurts and challenges are acknowledged and paid for \(however modestly\).
1.5.5.4.1.3.2. Pro: Black Americans are, according to [surveys](http://www.pewresearch.org/2010/07/01/proud-patriots-and-harsh-critics-of-government/), less patriotic than white Americans.
1.5.5.4.1.3.2.1. Con: These differences are a matter of degree. According to the [linked survey](http://www.pewresearch.org/2010/07/01/proud-patriots-and-harsh-critics-of-government/), more white people are "extremely proud" to be American than Black people. Yet, once not only "extremely" but also "very proud" people are taken into account, white and Black Americans show roughly equal patriotism.
1.5.5.4.1.3.2.2. Con: The gap between the share of white Americans and of non-white Americans who consider themselves "extremely proud" to be American has been [persistently shrinking](http://www.gallup.com/poll/193379/new-low-extremely-proud-americans.aspx).
1.5.5.4.2. Pro: More Black Americans are getting [DNA testing](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/reparations-slavery-dna-tests/) for the purpose of reclaiming their identities and seeking reparations.
1.5.5.4.3. Pro: The issue of slavery as an integral part of American history - and not merely an anomaly - would be brought to national attention.
1.5.5.4.3.1. Pro: Slavery has received disproportionately little attention in the public sphere. America has "[more Holocaust museums](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/13/the-u-s-has-35000-museums-why-is-only-one-about-slavery/?utm_term=.7369685922f9) than Israel, Germany and Poland combined" - yet only a single one dedicated to the issue of slavery.
1.5.5.4.3.2. Pro: The political center of the United States - the National Mall in D.C. - has featured museums dedicated to [Native Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_the_American_Indian) and even [the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Holocaust_Memorial_Museum) for decades, yet it took until 2016 to open one [on African-American history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_African_American_History_and_Culture).
1.5.5.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.5.5.4.5. Con: Reparations will cause societal backlash.
1.5.5.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.13.3.
1.5.5.4.5.2. Pro: Researchers have argued that the prospect of paying reparations can poison a community's social climate and create animosity. In the case of the idea of reparations for the [Tulsa race riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot), for example, there is a "tension between reparations and continued harmony" \([Brophy, p. 248](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=R-xXxCOXlkAC&pg=PA248&lpg=PA248&dq=reparations+animosity&source=bl&ots=sGIAAvzwZr&sig=keO7YaJp6w7J2UNRp8pZ7MTAj-U&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3i72uhM_QAhUJTrwKHUi4BDsQ6AEILDAC#v=onepage&q=reparations%20animosity&f=false)\).
1.5.5.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.4.
1.5.5.5. Pro: Reparations would be a clear apology for what was done to Black Americans.
1.5.5.5.1. Con: Money is ineffective as apology.
1.5.5.5.1.1. Con: In legal terms, money is an apology.
1.5.5.5.1.2. Pro: Money will not bring back dignity to those who have been denied it by more abstract instruments of discrimination.
1.5.5.5.1.3. Pro: Most people will prefer a kind of in-kind payment that removes obstacles to true equality than monetary compensation.
1.5.5.5.1.3.1. Pro: Passing non-discrimination laws relating to voting, housing, university admissions, or loan applications is more valuable than any monetary compensation.
1.5.5.5.1.3.1.1. Con: The regulations do not depend on the appropriation of funds, so they are mutually non-exclusive with reparative measures.
1.5.5.5.1.3.2. Con: It is a false dilemma to treat in-kind payments and monetary compensation as oppositional in this way. Money from reparations can be used to fund [institutions](http://www.diversitybestpractices.com/news-articles/20-african-american-organizations-you-need-know) that address these obstacles.
1.5.5.5.1.3.2.1. Pro: Many [nations](https://www.ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/reparations) have used reparations to set up funds for long-term institutions and programs.
1.5.5.5.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Arguments for reparations argue that injustices inflicted upon a group inevitably lead to a long term disadvantage for that group. This is disproven by the existence of Ashkenazi Jewry, who throughout history were prevented from getting work in most jobs, had their possessions stolen or destroyed and were murdered. Despite this, on measures of economic and educational standing they are at or near the top in all developed countries.
1.5.5.5.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: That reparations might not be warranted in the case of some historical injustices does not mean that they are never warranted. Each case should be evaluated on its own merits rather than submitted to a general rule derived from one example.
1.5.5.5.1.3.2.2. Pro: [Some](https://policy.m4bl.org/reparations/) calls for reparations for slavery call for using monetary compensation to fund institutions such as higher education, adequate housing and other goods that have been historically denied to Black Americans.
1.5.5.5.1.4. Con: Money can at least remove a constant argument that the government doesn't place any value on the lives and property of its citizens of colour.
1.5.5.5.1.5. Con: Money alone may be inadequate, but it is not mutually exclusive with taking other measures.
1.5.5.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.2.1.3.5.
1.5.5.5.3. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.10.1.
1.5.5.5.4. Pro: Acknowledging and redressing the wrongs committed against their ancestors would improve the relationship between the Black community and the US Government.
1.5.5.5.4.1. Pro: By acknowledging the harms done to their ancestors, the government is communicating to the Black community that, at least, the current iteration of the US government cares about them.
1.5.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.2.1.
1.5.5.7. Con: Reparations reinforce the notion of victimhood among Black Americans.
1.5.5.7.1. Con: Victimhood can be an asset in political bargaining.
1.5.5.7.1.1. Pro: The status of victimhood is one around which group identity can be formed. The fact that groups seek to [claim](http://mil.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/11/05/0305829814550258) it is a demonstration of its desirability - and hence, its power.
1.5.5.7.1.1.1. Pro: Establishing the perception of victimhood is positive as it has the potential to create a [class consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_consciousness). In the terms of Marx, it could transform Black American self-perception from that of a "class in itself" to that of a "class for itself", and thus enable effective political self-assertion.
1.5.5.7.1.1.1.1. Con: On the flip side, this would likely deepen the racial fissures in the United States and mark Black Americans as a minority that pursues goals in opposition to the majority.
1.5.5.7.1.2. Pro: Referencing the damage one has incurred is a good bargaining strategy that is widely used, e.g. by [South Korea](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/10/21/national/japan-funded-foundation-starts-payments-former-comfort-women/) to extract resources from Japan by continuous reference to the unresolved victimhood of former sex slaves.
1.5.5.7.1.3. Pro: Black Americans can point to the promise of the American Dream - according to which, everyone gets a chance - and to the legacy of slavery that puts them in a starting position far worse than other Americans.
1.5.5.7.1.4. Con: There is a danger of 'victim fatigue'. The so-called '[Korea fatigue](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/america-japan-getting-korea-fatigue)' of Japan \(and increasingly the US\), for example, reduces the salience of Korean demands for historical restitution.
1.5.5.7.1.5. Con: It is unlikely that the American public will be receptive towards attempts at self-victimization by the Black Community.
1.5.5.7.1.5.1. Con: It is incorrect to regard claiming one's identity as a victim as "self-victimization."
1.5.5.7.1.5.2. Pro: Self-victimization of the Black community can easily be interpreted by other stakeholders as an opportunistic attempt at guilt-tripping and thus receive a negative reaction.
1.5.5.7.1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.5.5.7.1.5.4. Con: There is already a significant discussion about whether the US should pay slavery reparations. This illustrates the power that the narrative of victimisation holds in the US context.
1.5.5.7.1.5.4.1. Con: Just because a topic features in the public discourse does not mean that a majority of the public cares about it. Agendas can, after all, be set by vocal minorities or specific groups, for example activists or academics.
1.5.5.7.2. Con: If Black Americans are victims of slavery, this is merely accurate.
1.5.5.7.3. Pro: Even though most living Black Americans have at best an indirect linkage to the evils of slavery, reparations would recognize them as victims. As these indirect effects inevitably will persist, reparations will thus help to foster a sense of being victims for all times to come.
1.5.5.7.3.1. Con: It requires a large leap to go from a recognition of particular historical injustices to permanent victimhood.
1.5.5.7.4. Pro: Some claim that Black Americans are held back not by "white racism" but a stifling reverence for "victimology" \([McWhorter, p. x](https://books.google.co.th/books?id=UvMGxQrbQREC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.5.5.7.4.1. Pro: This line of [argument](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2008-08-10/news/0808080126_1_dependency-theory-african-americans-dead-wrong) regards reparations as the extreme case of Black victimology as they represent the ultimate dependence on the benevolence of white Americans.
1.5.5.7.4.1.1. Con: It is doubtful whether reparations would be financially significant enough to create any relationship of dependency.
1.5.6. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.5.
1.5.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.13.2.1.5.
1.5.8. Con: Considered as a whole, modern Americans \(including Black Americans\) are no longer affected by slavery. There has been a level playing field for generations.
1.5.8.1. Pro: Modern whites do not benefit from slavery because they never owned slaves and many economic disasters have shuffled the deck.
1.5.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.3.5.
1.5.8.1.2. Con: Whites need not have directly owned slaves to have benefited from social and economic advantages that were not as accessible to their black counterparts.
1.5.8.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.3.2.
1.5.8.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.13.3.3.2.
1.5.8.2. Pro: The legacy of slavery plays little role in the problems currently faced by the black community. There are many social ills perpetuated by the black community themselves i.e. poor education performance, the fatherless rate, black on black crime, etc... and reparations would not solve these problems.
1.5.8.2.1. Con: Just because reparations would not solve all the problems from which the Black community suffers today does not mean that slavery did not contribute to the disadvantagement of Black Americans as well as these problems.
1.5.8.2.2. Pro: Personal choices are major contributors to the poverty and disadvantages these communities face today and cannot be solely attributed to historical systemic disadvantages.
1.5.8.2.2.1. Pro: African American communities have [high teen pregnancy rates.](https://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-development/reproductive-health-and-teen-pregnancy/teen-pregnancy-and-childbearing/trends/index.html)
1.5.8.2.2.1.1. Con: High teen pregnancy rates are also the result of structural factors, some of which Black Americans suffer from disproportionately. Among these determinants of pregnancy rates are the [prevalence of poverty](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/379217), [career prospects and family background](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/png/ajhb/2004/00000028/00000004/art00008), such as the education of the parents.
1.5.8.2.2.1.2. Con: Between 2006 and 2016, the teenage pregnancy rate among Black Americans [fell by 44%](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0428-teen-birth-rates.html). This indicates that the association of Black Americans with persistently high teenage pregnancy rates may be soon outdated.
1.5.8.2.2.2. Pro: African American communities have high rates of [single parent homes](http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/107-children-in-single-parent-families-by#detailed/1/any/false/573,869,36,868,867/10,11,9,12,1,185,13/432,431) compared to other demographics
1.5.8.2.2.2.1. Con: Divorce rates also correlate [with structural factors](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1353%2Fdem.2002.0019?LI=true), some of which Black Americans are affected by disproportionately. Among them are low education, child birth at an early age and parental divorce.
1.5.8.2.2.2.2. Con: 'Welfare' incentives female head of household with no male. Households like this produce poor people disproportionately compared to two parent households. Children from such homes have higher rates of poverty, incarceration, etc.
1.5.8.2.2.3. Pro: The [high school drop out rate](http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/107-children-in-single-parent-families-by#detailed/1/any/false/573,869,36,868,867/10,11,9,12,1,185,13/432,431) in African American communities has been significantly higher than that of whites, though much progress has been made to reduce this \(13.1% in 2000 down to 6.5% in 2015\)
1.5.8.2.2.3.1. Con: [Numerous](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1556-6678.2007.tb00463.x/abstract) [studies](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/07419325070280060201) [have](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED484525.pdf) [shown](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/07419325070280060201) that socio-economic factors such as family income, family structure and education level of parents affect dropout rates. Black families suffer from low socio-economic status disproportionally - and their kids are thus more likely to drop out in part for structural factors.
1.5.8.2.2.4. Con: The simple existence of differences between Black Americans and white Americans does not establish that these differences are caused by personal choices. When dealing with demographic differences, structural factors are much more likely causes.
1.5.8.2.2.4.1. Pro: The alternative, in which individual personal choices are taken to be responsible for "social ills" that affect Black Americans more than other groups, makes an implicit judgement about the relative moral character of Black Americans as opposed to other racial groups. But that judgement is unwarranted.
1.5.8.2.2.4.2. Con: When dealing with demographic differences, the greatest factor is cultural, not structural. The political/social structures apply to everyone. How each culture interacts with those structures is what creates disparities.
1.5.8.2.2.4.2.1. Con: Race is not a cultural category, but a social [category](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/06/16/how-fluid-is-racial-identity/race-and-racial-identity-are-social-constructs).
1.5.8.2.2.4.2.2. Con: Cultural [racism](http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6137/Cultural-Racism.html) \(assertion of Black culture and assignation of negative stereotypes to that culture\) is a form of racism that has become fashionable as biological racism has been discredited and yet it is just as wrong.
1.5.8.2.2.4.2.3. Con: Political/social structures apply to everyone, but they do not have equal effect. While a "right" culture helps to reduce disparity, differences in social position result in different outcomes, regardless of culture.
1.5.8.2.2.4.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.6.
1.5.8.2.2.5. Con: As [studies](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6149/976) studies indicate, poor personal choices might also be the outcome of structural and historical forces. For example, poverty impairs cognitive functioning and sound financial decision-making.
1.5.8.2.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.7.1.
1.5.8.2.2.7. Con: Current problems faced by the Black community cannot be blamed exclusively on personal choices. Even personal choices are influenced by an environment in which the legacy of slavery continues [through penal practices](http://theconversation.com/exploiting-black-labor-after-the-abolition-of-slavery-72482).
1.5.8.2.2.7.1. Pro: The [13th amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) states - slavery is abolished "except" as punishment for being duly convicted of a crime. During [Jim Crow](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/10/06/ava-duvernays-netflix-film-13th-reveals-how-mass-incarceration-is-an-extension-of-slavery/?noredirect=on) and arguably still today, that loophole was used to exploit penal black labor in forms that are de facto enslavement.
1.5.8.2.2.7.2. Pro: Practices such as Jim Crow laws, Voter Suppression,The Red Summer Riots of 1919, Redlining, and the Three Strikes Law, taken in tandem with the 13th Amendment, have created a matrix of socioeconomic disenfranchisement for African Americans.
1.5.8.2.2.7.2.1. Con: Redlining was declared illegal with the passage of the [Fair Housing Act.](https://www.justice.gov/crt/fair-housing-act-2)
1.5.8.2.2.7.2.1.1. Con: The Fair Housing Act was not passed until 1968. This meant that Black Americans were [largely excluded](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/02/the-effects-of-housing-segregation-on-black-wealth/272775/) from the post WWII housing boom, which formed the basis for much white middle class wealth.  Additionally, the enforcement mechanism of the Fair Housing Act has been [weak](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808815/). The result is there is still [evidence that redlining persists.](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/04/how-the-fair-housing-act-failed-black-homeowners/557576/)
1.5.8.2.2.7.2.1.1.1. Con: If the passage of a law that makes an act illegal is not relevant, the action made illegal is also irrelevant.
1.5.8.2.2.7.2.2. Con: The [Civil Rights Act](http://www.historyinanhour.com/2013/09/23/the-jim-crow-laws-brief-summary/) made Jim Crow laws illegal.
1.5.8.2.2.7.2.2.1. Con: The Civil Rights act was passed in 1963 - and [violent resistance](https://eji.org/racial-justice/resistance-civil-rights) to it persisted well beyond that. Pointing out that it made Jim Crow laws illegal 98 years after the abolition of slavery therefore has no relevance to the persistence of slavery-like practices well beyond the de jure abolition of slavery.
1.5.8.2.2.7.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.8.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.
1.5.8.2.2.7.2.3. Con: The [Voting Rights Act](https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act) made voter suppression illegal.
1.5.8.2.2.7.2.3.1. Con: The Voting Rights Act was signed in 1965, one hundred years after the abolition of slavery, precisely to remedy the ongoing effects referred to in the grandparent.  And many have argued that the Supreme Court's [ruling](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html) in 2013 has crippled the enforcement mechanism of the Voting Rights Act. Thus, as a matter of post-Civil War history history and the current state of affairs,  pointing to the passage of the Voting Rights Act has little relevance to the situation of Black Americans broadly.
1.5.8.2.2.7.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.8.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.
1.5.8.2.3. Con: -> See 1.5.8.2.2.4.
1.5.8.2.4. Con: Poor educational performance, fatherless rate are not necessarily "perpetuated by the black community". Correlation is not a causality. It's also a loaded argument if these issues are equaled to black-on-black crime. Reparations do not have to solve these problems. That is not their purpose. Their purpose is to allocate resources to be able to start to solve these problems.
1.5.8.3. Pro: Poverty is the primary problem facing Black Americans today, independent of its historical origins and relationship to race.
1.5.8.3.1. Con: If the poverty has been perpetuated and reproduced through earlier configurations of a still extant structures, then the historical roots of poverty do matter for the purpose of ending poverty.
1.5.8.3.1.1. Pro: Johnson saw the "devastating heritage of long years of slavery" as a primary reason of poverty and inequality. He [argued that](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=27021) "Negro poverty is not white poverty" and that the differences lie not in race but in "ancient brutality, past injustice, and present prejudice".
1.5.8.3.1.2. Con: That structure was slavery and it is no longer extant. Poverty in Appalachia will continue as long as various forms of welfare continue to allow it. That is an extant structure and can be blamed for contemporary poverty. Slavery is not and therefore cannot.
1.5.8.4. Con: This level playing field simply does not exist; many black families are still entrenched in poverty because of the historic effects of the very recent era of outright discrimination.
1.5.8.4.1. Pro: Real estate agents discriminate against families of color when selling houses, enforcing [de facto segregation](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america), which exists even after the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
1.5.8.4.2. Pro: For example: the voting rights act was only passed in 1965, and even afterwards blacks were too intimidated by violence to vote. Indeed, there were [credible allegations](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/poll-monitoring-voter-intimidation-lawsuits/506078/) of voter intimidation as recently as 2016.
1.5.8.4.2.1. Pro: Voter [registration](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/15/do-voter-identification-laws-suppress-minority-voting-yes-we-did-the-research/) laws have been shown to suppress minority voting.
1.5.8.4.2.2. Pro: Voter suppression in Florida [swung](https://www.thenation.com/article/recent-history-gop-voter-suppression-florida/) Florida's presidential election sufficiently to give Bush the Presidency, despite losing the popular vote.
1.5.8.5. Pro: [About 13.5%](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states#Demographic) of today's population of the United States immigrated. Most of these individuals have no connection to either perpetrators or victims of slavery.
1.5.8.5.1. Con: These individuals still profit from the wealth and power of the United States that is - at least partially - based on the labor and exploitation of slaves in the past.
1.5.8.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.3.2.
1.5.8.6. Con: The legacy of slavery plays a significant role in the problems currently faced by the American community. To question impact of those 12 to 21 generations is as unrealistic as questioning the impact of Christopher Columbus or the War for Independence on America?  Because slavery was an economic system to exploit labor, the national racism, capital and the inequity created are clearly results.  Reparations should be paid, not just in dollars, but in mentoring, services and development.
1.5.8.7. Con: Racial inequality even to the point of segregation only goes back a couple of generations \(Many are still alive that lived through it\).  Segregation is a result result of slavery, thus US slavery is still impacting us today.
1.5.8.8. Con: A level playing field "for generations" has not existed and does not currently exist. Massive [inequality in law enforcement](http://newjimcrow.com/) is still prevalent. Massive racial disparities in [housing](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/Publications/pdf/HUD-514_HDS2012.pdf), [employment](https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/1-18-17a.cfm), and [education](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/08/02/actually-we-still-need-affirmative-action-for-african-americans-in-college-admissions-heres-why/?utm_term=.2eec1cb388f2) have all been studied and ample evidence exists showing that all are still prevalent. So the "Con" argument is based on a false premise.
1.5.9. Pro: You cannot have true equality without equity being established first. Equality only works when everyone starts from the same place and needs the same help.
1.5.9.1. Con: Almost everybody is born into a unique situation and starts from a unique place. That is a part of life.
To establish true equality is to bring some down in order to bring others up, without any reason for the transfer other than "the pursuit of equality."
1.5.10. Con: Looking back at American history, there is no reason to believe that Black Americans would accrue the benefits that the lofty rhetoric of reparations promises to them.
1.5.10.1. Pro: Black Americans were freed in 1864 through the [Thirteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) and became full citizens in [1868](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) through the [Fourteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution). Yet the amendment's idea that the government shall not "abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens" existed only on paper for at least another century, for example because of the [Jim Crow laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws).
1.5.10.1.1. Pro: Even today, laws are in place or being enacted that effectively [suppress voting along racial lines](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/how-voter-id-laws-discriminate-study/517218/) and hit Black Americans especially hard, for example through ID requirements.
1.5.10.2. Con: That the U.S. has in the past been unsuccessful at reckoning with the evil of slavery does not mean that it should not try to do better. Rather, it shows the urgency of doing so in a well devised way. Reparations done properly can be a way of rectifying these past failures.
1.5.11. Con: Reparations for Black Americans are currently not warranted as other groups with equal or even stronger claims, for example Native Americans, did not receive any compensation yet.
1.5.12. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.
1.5.13. Pro: Reparations should be given to descendants of slaves because slavery restricted the human progress \(economies, social norms, land acquisition, business creation\) of black americans. Time for progress which the white people who enslaved them not only had, but used in order to remain in a position of power.
1.5.14. Pro: Slavery built wealth for white families, individual states, and companies. That wealth continued to grow over centuries; at the same time, the US has done nothing to close the gap that exists between white and black Americans.
1.5.14.1. Pro: The fact that slavery was building wealth for those currently in power justifies the reparations. If financed through means such as targeted tax hikes, they do not necessarily affect an average citizen negatively, only those in wealth.
1.5.14.2. Pro: Tax increases to accommodate reparations do not have to be for everyone, but within a set of parameters to avoid taxing those with lower income and whose ancestors’ involvement is not a fact.
1.5.15. Con: Financial reparations will do nothing to address the problems facing Black Americans right now.
1.5.15.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.
1.5.15.2. Con: Much of the impact of structural inequality is felt in wealth inequality. It is certainly possible that some Black people will use the stability and security that the money brings to better their lives.
1.5.15.2.1. Con: If much of the impact of structural inequality is felt in wealth inequality, then you don't address wealth inequality, you address structural inequality. Monetary reparations will not fix structural inequality, just like morphine doesn't cure cancer.
1.5.15.2.2. Con: Simply dumping people money does not ensure financial success. Let's take the lottery for example. People win hundreds of millions of dollars, yet some [70% of lottery winners go broke within a year or two.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2013/08/25/what-not-to-do-lottery-winners/2696845/) It is much more important to be financially competent and responsible than it is to have money given to you.
1.5.15.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.1.3.
1.5.15.2.2.2. Con: This assumes however that the only possible method of dispensing or paying reparations is a cash handout. But this is not necessarily the case. It is also possible the reparations money could be paid to the community in some other fashion, such as by providing investment in infrastructure, business grants, educational funds, drug rehab programs, grants or low/no-interest loans to buy homes to rectify historic discriminatory real-estate practices, etc.
1.5.15.3. Pro: Monetary Reparations can never fully compensate for crimes of morality. Monetary reparations can only be used to describe the relative amount damage that slavery cost, but cannot pay for the damage done. Reparations are therefore an ineffective means to pay for slavery.
1.5.15.3.1. Con: There is a large difference between full compensation and no compensation. While the full damage of slavery can never be undone, it does not follow that monetary reparations could not help to ameliorate some of its negative effects.
1.5.15.4. Pro: Paying reparations perpetuates stereotypes that Black Americans cannot achieve success without outside aid.
1.5.15.4.1. Con: Reparations are not charity.
1.5.15.5. Con: Problems in the Black Community include lacking education, housing, healthcare, and jobs. Communities demand these but cannot afford or invest in them. Reparations would allow Black communities to invest in themselves.
1.5.15.5.1. Con: Policy changes to improve public education, and access to housing, healthcare, and jobs, although more difficult to implement, will be more effective in the long term than simply increasing funding.
1.5.15.5.1.1. Con: More systematic changes are important but more difficult to implement and not mutually exclusive with reparations.
1.5.15.5.1.2. Con: It is highly improbable that policies implemented by a majority of people who are not black and who don't know the specific problems plaguing the black community first hand would be more effective than direct reparations to African Americans.
1.5.15.5.2. Con: -> See 1.5.8.2.
1.5.15.5.3. Pro: This would not only address financial questions, but would establish a new norm in the society that wants to promote equality. This will improve the standing of Black Communities as their historical struggles will be acknowledged.
1.5.15.5.4. Pro: Funding preschools and schools that serve a large number of people who are descended from slaves would alleviate the economic disparity between this group and others.
1.5.15.6. Con: Even if reparations are not sufficient to address the problems faced by the Black community, they do play an important role.
1.5.15.6.1. Pro: When dealing with systematic poverty, systematic solutions are necessary. This means direct support from the structures that created the inequality in the first place.
1.5.15.6.1.1. Con: There are many ways one can succeed individually. The claim that there is "no way" is false.
1.5.15.6.2. Pro: A completely legalistic approach fails to deal with the fact that the laws themselves helped to create this injustice. In such cases, the state should be involved in the restitution.
1.5.15.7. Pro: There is not a single example globally of an obviously successful outcome from colonial reparations. Simply put, there is no evidence colonial or slavery reparations helps in any way the society in which they are provided, or the people who are targeted.
1.5.15.7.1. Pro: In New Zealand, [significant sums of money and land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi_claims_and_settlements) have been returned to native Maori since the 1970s. It has done nothing to ease racial tensions, nor made Maori as a whole benefit, but only elites within their ranks.
1.5.15.7.1.1. Pro: Maori are still [much more likely](https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/287010/stats-show-maori-still-facing-discrimination) to report discrimination based on their ethnicity than other groups, for example in the[justice system](https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/254352/maori-party-wants-justice-review).
1.5.15.7.1.2. Pro: Maori suffer not only from inequality, but even from a growing gap between their own situation and that of European citizens, for examples in areas like health, higher education, and unemployment \([Marriott/Sim, p. 28](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cpf/publications/pdfs/2015/WP09_2014_Indicators-of-Inequality.pdf)\).
1.5.15.7.1.3. Con: Even if the tangible effects may have been disappointing, the reparations given to the Maori still represent an important gesture and signal that the country has changed.
1.5.15.7.1.4. Con: Many Maori activists have argued that the reparations are ultimately insufficient in their magnitude. If we divided the [$2.5 billion](https://www.nzcpr.com/test-post-220/) so far paid among the [500,000 Maori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_New_Zealand#Ethnicity) in New Zealand, each person would receive $5,000, a significant amount to be sure, but hardly enough to rectify hundreds of years of mistreatment.
1.5.15.7.2. Con: We can estimate the impact of reparations not only by examining earlier colonial reparations programs - which are few and far between - but also by examining many similar programs, such as affirmative action, debt forgiveness, and charity.
1.5.15.7.3. Con: If I stole a car from you, then it may be right to compel me to return it, even if it cannot be established that returning it will help you or your community. Analogously, reparations may be justified even if we cannot predict their effects.
1.5.15.8. Pro: Reparations that are given out purely on the basis of race would be ineffective; they have to take additional factors - such as the economic status of individual Black Americans - into account.
1.5.15.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.5.15.9. Pro: This would only lead to more division and hatred within the African American Community. On one hand, black families not receiving the reparations will resent the ones who do. On the other hand, actual recipient families may take offense to the protests from non-recipient families.
1.5.15.10. Con: The point of paying reperations is not about solving the issues  of today, it's about expressing that the nation now understands what it did was wrong and is extending an apology in more than words.
1.5.15.11. Con: Given the number of problems that all Americans face which are rooted in a lack of resources, it is wrong to suggest that a large influx of cash would do nothing to address these problems.
1.5.15.11.1. Pro: Problems related to securing adequate food and shelter would be aided at least a little bit by an influx of money to a broad population.
1.5.15.11.2. Pro: Problems related to healthcare could be ameliorated at least in part by an influx of money to a broad population of Americans.
1.5.15.11.3. Pro: Even if problems related to educational access were not wholly solved by an influx of money to a broad segment of Americans, an influx of money could help address them by supplying some of the resources needed to secure that access.
1.5.15.12. Pro: If reparations were made there would be no way to guarantee that the recipients, who were never enslaved themselves, would as a group forgive all they view as oppressors. Only by signing an legal settlement agreement to not seek further compensation would this be possible. There is no dollar amount that could appease those who feel wronged if they have been unable to find it in them to forgive people who have been dead more than a century. When the money runs out the resentment will return.
1.5.15.13. Con: The problems facing black America have everything to do with wealth. During the era of a rapidly growing middle class, black Americans were excluded from building generational wealth through the practice of redlining. Black Americans are disproportionately poor because they were locked out of the American Dream during the rapid growth of the American Dream.
1.5.15.14. Pro: If you believe a college education enables upward mobility, then free college for everyone -- meaning people of all races -- is better than a quick infusion of cash.
1.5.15.15. Pro: There are alternatives to reparations that would likely to a better job at addressing the issues facing Black Americans today.
1.5.15.15.1. Pro: From an economic perspective, the trickling effect shows how money is better spent on today's issues \(such as homelessness\), since it creates reparations than vice versa. 
If the reparations are paid, that money will not go towards solving current issues. However, if we focus on today's issues, then everyone benefits \(including the people who get the reparations\). The indirect benefit \(improving the quality of life\) is a type of reparation.
1.5.15.15.2. Pro: Insofar as Black Americans suffer from the biased and arbitrary exercise of police power against them, the pursuit of equal justice should take priority. Paying reparations does nothing to further this pursuit
1.5.15.15.2.1. Pro: Malcolm X argued that the [policing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDEL96igPAA) of Black Americans was a primary obstacle to positive justice.
1.5.15.15.2.2. Pro: [Half of all Black Americans](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/10/25/559015355/how-black-americans-see-discrimination) state in surveys that they have experienced discrimination by the police.
1.5.15.15.2.2.1. Con: Just because Black Americans think they experience discrimination does not mean that they actually do.
1.5.15.15.2.3. Pro: Black Americans [make up](https://www.vox.com/cards/police-brutality-shootings-us/us-police-racism) a disproportionate share of those who are killed by the police without attacking. In general, minorities make up a disproportionate share of those killed by the police even though they are unarmed.
1.5.15.15.2.4. Con: Statistically, any random Black American a police officer encounters is [more likely to be a criminal](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-black-americans-commit-crime) than a white American. It is therefore reasonable for police officers to be more cautious when dealing with Black Americans; this form of bias is warranted and understandable.
1.5.15.15.2.4.1. Con: The incarceration [gap](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-farbota/black-crime-rates-your-st_b_8078586.html) is not a neutral statistic, but is itself a result of the over-policing of the Black community.
1.5.15.15.2.5. Con: Whether true or not, this argument does not address the issue of whether financial reparations would or would not "do nothing" for the problems faced by Black Americans today.
1.5.15.15.3. Pro: Opportunity for less skilled jobs increases wealth.
1.5.15.15.3.1. Pro: Stopping immigration for less skilled jobs would increase the wealth of black people.
1.5.15.15.4. Pro: More opportunity for education increases wealth.
1.5.15.15.5. Pro: Free-healthcare, daycare and quality schooling, i.e. treating black people like as full and equal citizens, would do more than reparation payments.
1.5.15.15.6. Pro: Racial inequality issues that stemmed from slavery have now morphed into geographical inequality issues. Because PoC tended to settle in particular areas due to segregation, these areas have received little govt/state investment over time. Reparations won't fix that, but increased govt expenditure to improve and regenerate towns, schools, public services etc, will make a difference and likely eradicate many disadvantages that PoC currently face.
1.5.15.15.7. Pro: The US should pay reparations, but not as simple cash lump sums. Since the consequences of slavery have spiraled out to affect communities of color in [complex ways](https://psmag.com/economics/slaverys-legacy-race-based-economic-inequality-83854), the best way to make compensation is to enact policies to repair broken communities and restore to them economic, political, educational, and social power.
1.5.15.15.7.1. Pro: Reparations for descendants of slaves should be targeted toward vastly improving educational and job opportunities. A modest proposal: free tutoring in school, free college for those qualified, paid apprenticeship for two years in any field, cost-shared by the government.
1.5.15.15.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.3.6.
1.5.15.15.8. Pro: [Armstrong Williams](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/8/williams-blacks-must-face-their-communitys-problem/) claims that some problems facing African Americans cannot be effectively dealt with through top-down solutions but have to approached from within the community.
1.5.15.15.8.1. Con: This claim is based on the current situation. If widespread reparations happened, the social situation would be different in a way heretofore unseen in the US. Wealth would flow into the Black community in an unprecedented way. There is no comparison to any previous social endeavor.
1.5.15.15.8.2. Con: That a proposal may not effectively deal with "some" problems does not establish or even imply that the proposal is not worthwhile. Few solutions fix all problems. If reparations are expected to cause more good than harm, given their costs, then they should be considered, whether or not they are also a panacea for all things.
1.5.15.15.8.3. Con: This argument appears to wrongly 1\) assume a false dichotomy, in that solutions must either originate "top-down" OR from "within the community," not both; and 2\) assume that reparations would classify within this dichotomy as "top-down." More likely, reparations, by increasing the resources possessed within communities, would serve to empower those very communities to generate positive change from within, and would thus drive change both from the "top-down" and from "within the community."
1.5.15.15.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.
1.5.15.15.10. Pro: -> See 1.5.15.2.2.
1.5.15.15.11. Con: Reparations and alternative measures can be implemented together and do not exclude each other.
1.5.15.16. Pro: The mechanisms suggested for funding such reparations would most likely hit the poorest in America hardest, particularly under the current government. Given the existing relationship between poverty and ethnicity this would likely do more harm than good.
1.5.16. Con: Not only would reparations not benefit Black Americans; they would actually make their situation worse.
1.5.16.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.7.
1.5.16.2. Pro: Reparations would further add to the stereotype of Black Americans as victims in American society.
1.5.16.2.1. Pro: The narrative of Black Americans as victims [has been criticized](https://theamericanscholar.org/the-end-of-the-black-american-narrative/)as being stuck in the past, not appropriate to represent the complexities of contemporary America, and as an ideology that potentially "remake\[s\] natural beings after its own image".
1.5.17. Con: Present day Americans who are descended from slaves are significantly better off than present day Africans across a number of different metrics, suggesting that there is no need for reparations as they are already relatively advantaged with equal legal protections as any other American.
1.5.17.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.9.2.
1.5.17.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.9.4.
1.5.17.3. Pro: The average African American is almost 50 times wealthier than the average African, with an [average wealth of $95,000](https://www.financialsamurai.com/the-average-net-worth-and-income-for-african-americans/) versus [just $2,000](https://fr.africacheck.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Africa-wealth-report-2017.pdf).
1.5.17.3.1. Con: Slavery may be among the reasons why Black Americans are more wealthy than Africans. But it is also among the reasons why the wealth of the average white American is more than seven times that of the average Black American. Thus, the relative wealth of Black Americans could still justify reparations.
1.5.17.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.
1.5.17.4. Con: Determining harm by comparing present day Americans descended from slaves to distantly related present day Africans is not the most appropriate standard. A better comparison is between American citizens who are descended from slaves and American citizens who are not. There are substantial [wealth](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2018/02/21/447051/systematic-inequality/) and [income](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/07/07/the-wage-gap-between-white-and-black-men-is-growing-wider) gaps between black Americans and white Americans likely [attributable](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/23/the-half-has-never-been-told_n_6036840.html) at least in part to the institution of slavery.
1.5.17.4.1. Pro: Whereas any mechanism of determining a historical harm will depend upon a number of assumptions, determining the harm done to Black Americans by comparing them to present day Africans depends upon more questionable hypotheses than does determining harm by comparing Black Americans to non-Black Americans.
1.5.17.4.1.1. Pro: The primary assumptions that are being made when we determine historical harm by comparing Black Americans to non-Black Americans are 1\) that barring some other set of causal factors, we should expect a relatively uniform distribution of properties such as wealth and income across different samples and 2\) that if those causal factors are unjustifiable, than there is an historical harm.
1.5.17.4.1.1.1. Pro: Given the centrality of [slave codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_codes) and subsequent[Jim crow laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws) in the relations between Black and white Americans, it is reasonable to see them as likely causal factors of large differences in wealth and income distributions between Black and white Americans.
1.5.17.4.1.1.2. Pro: Insofar as enslavement is unjustifiable, any difference in wealth or income that is attributable to it is prima facie a harm.
1.5.17.4.1.2. Pro: The assumption that historical harm should be determined by Black Americans to present day Africans depends on at least one of two questionable assumptions. Either it asserts the primacy of race over citizenship, or else it depends upon the \(unproven\) counterfactuals that a\) were it not for the Transatlantic slave trade, most Black Americans would be Africans, b\) that the situation of Africa would be roughly the same, and c\) the situation of the US would be roughly the same.
1.5.17.4.1.2.1. Pro: If the assumption that is being used to justify the comparison of Black Americans to present day Africans is primarily racial then it fails compared to the comparison of Black Americans and non-black Americans insofar as there are many more economically relevant differences between the sets of Americans and Africans than the sets of Black and white Americans. These differences make it much more difficult to draw reliable conclusions.
1.5.17.4.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.9.4.4.
1.5.17.4.2. Con: This doesn't take into account the other advantages of being an American, for example that you'll live more than 15% longer on average
1.5.17.4.2.1. Pro: The life expectancy of African Americans is [~75 years](https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/usa/life-expectancy-african-american), whereas the life expectancy of Africans is lower by [more than 10 years.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/274511/life-expectancy-in-africa/)
1.5.17.5. Con: Making claims about whether or not the "descendants of slaves are financially better off now than had their ancestors not been enslaved," commits the fallacy of the [simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_the_single_cause) cause.
1.5.17.5.1. Pro: Even assuming it were shown that Black Americans are better off than they otherwise would have been had their ancestors not been subjected to forcible immigration, this would only show that no reparations would be due for forcible immigration. It says nothing about whether or not reparation would be due for any harms suffered subsequent to immigration. These would include any harms that accrued from the practice of slavery in the US.
1.5.17.5.1.1. Pro: While some indentured servants were also subject to forced [immigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentured_servitude_in_the_Americas), the temporary nature of indentured servitude, and the fact that indentured servants retained some legal rights shows that the effects produced by enslavement can be [distinguished](https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awlaw3/slavery.html) by the effects merely produced by forced immigration. Chief among these was the institution of [chattel slavery](https://ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/timeline/slavery.htm), that is the legal identification of an individual \(and their descendants\) as property with no rights.
1.5.17.5.1.1.1. Pro: The harm inflicted by the practice of chattel slavery is independent of any benefit or harm that may have accrued from forced immigration. Insofar as this debate considers whether the practice of chattel slavery in the US warrants reparations, questions about any benefits or harms that accrued from forced immigration are irrelevant.
1.5.17.5.1.2. Con: Attempting to distinguish between the act of immigration and subsequent harm makes no sense as the comparison of wealth takes all factors into account up until the present day.
1.5.17.5.1.2.1. Con: The premise of this claim ignores the factors such as the negative economic impacts of having millions of people stolen from the land and the people subjugated and exploited through colonization.
1.5.17.5.2. Con: There is no fallacy in the grandparent claim, and so the parent claim is moot.
1.5.17.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.17.4.2.1.
1.6. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.2.1.2.2.5.
1.8. Con: The US track record of exploitation is quite long. Paying slavery reparations would be a slippery slope for other groups to claim the same.
1.8.1. Pro: There are those who argue that [women](http://bigthink.com/ideafeed/are-reparations-for-women-a-solution-to-the-gender-wage-gap) should receive reparations for their structural disadvantages in society.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Specifically in the context of equal pay, the financial cost correlation is both undeniable and calculable.
1.8.2. Pro: People of Chinese descent were treated horribly in the US - by the federal and state governments and the majority society - from the 1870s until well into the twentieth century \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Chinese_sentiment_in_the_United_States), [HarpWeek](http://immigrants.harpweek.com/ChineseAmericans/1Introduction/BillWeiIntro.htm)\).
1.8.3. Con: Having reparations for other groups could very well be appropriate. They should be paid back if massive historical injustices have been committed against them.
1.8.3.1. Con: It is difficult to designate where the line would be drawn and it could arguably include descendants of Irish or Italian migrants to the US, individuals with an LGBT identity or even descendants of the white lower class.
1.8.3.2. Pro: Indeed, such cases are being considered systematically. The Transformative Justice movement is working through the United Nations to address development and the need for other historical reparations [\(UN Women\)](http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/Headquarters/Attachments/Sections/Library/Publications/2012/10/06A-Development-Gender.pdf).
1.8.4. Pro: How reparations for Black Americans are perceived and used by other groups needs to be considered, as the government has to consider the effects on its bargaining positions vis-á-vis other groups that put forward demands.
1.8.5. Con: Making the US pay for reparations of all wronged groups could have the affect of limiting wrongs done in the future. It could be an economic incentive toward justice.
1.8.6. Con: The system of slavery was one of the most extensive injustices that the US has committed. It is unlikely that many other groups have as compelling claims for reparations.
1.8.6.1. Con: The US has a long list of extensive injustices, starting from war crimes in WWII via massacres in Vietnam to sexual exploitation of women in war zones and around military bases.
1.8.6.1.1. Con: None of these crimes was as widely condoned by the US population or had as many victims as slavery.
1.8.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.8.3.
1.8.6.2. Pro: The system of African slavery had unique characteristics compared to the treatment of other groups in the U.S. \(i.e. near complete inability to earn and retain wealth individually and amongst family members, lack of choice in "immigrating" to the U.S.\). These characteristics act as limiting factors to other reparations claims.
1.8.7. Pro: The African World Reparations and Repatriation Truth Commission is seeking reparations for the African continent of [$777 trillion](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304682504579155801059827092). They would receive legitimacy once the US pays slavery reparations.
1.8.7.1. Con: Reparations for slavery are meant to further reconciliation within the community of American citizens. Reparations to non-Americans are of a different category as these people were and are not part of American society.
1.8.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.8.4.
1.8.8. Con: "Slippery slope" arguments like this are logically faulty in that they wrongly presume that 1\) principled distinctions cannot easily be drawn and that 2\) the slope slides somewhere that, on net, is bad. Neither presumption is justified here. It's easy to identify slavery as a unique harm without true parallel in American history. It's also easy to argue that paying reparations to all exploited groups would be a net benefit. As such, this slippery slope doesn't hold up either narrowly or broadly.
1.8.8.1. Con: Actually, in this case, principled distinctions cannot be easily drawn and any reasonable person would argue that the 'net' would be bad. Ergo, it's a slippery slope.
1.8.9. Pro: Native Americans would likely claim and deserve reparations, too.
1.8.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.4.
1.8.10. Con: Just because it may be a slippery slope doesn't mean that you should not do it. It may still be the best thing to do.
1.8.11. Con: It should be a slippery slope that leads to other groups to claim the same. This is how society develops towards equality and acceptance of its past.
1.8.12. Con: To say that other groups don't need reparations begs the question of the thesis.
1.8.12.1. Con: -> See 1.8.4.
1.8.13. Pro: The US has never paid reparations for its colonies, such as the Philippines, even though it ruled cruelly.
1.8.13.1. Con: Perhaps the US should pay reparations for its colonies that it has ruled over cruelly. Just because the US has not paid reparations yet does not mean it was morally correct for them to not have paid them.
1.8.13.1.1. Con: -> See 1.8.4.
1.8.13.2. Con: -> See 1.8.7.1.
1.8.14. Pro: Black Americans have been discriminated against much longer than just during slavery, thus there would be a need for reparations for this suffering as well.
1.8.14.1. Con: Reparations for some wrongs to a group are better than no reparations for any wrongs, even if it doesn't address all forms of wrongdoing.
1.8.15. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.4.1.1.
1.8.16. Pro: Over half of all [European immigrants](http://mertsahinoglu.com/research/indentured-servitude-colonial-america/) to Colonial America during the 17th and 18th centuries arrived as indentured servants. Due to the treatment many servants endured, their descendants may want reparations as well.
1.8.16.1. Con: European immigrants to America cannot point to persistent structural discrimination, whereas Black Americans can.
1.8.16.2. Con: Indentured servants are not the same thing as slaves.
1.8.17. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.1.2.1.
1.9. Pro: The nature of slavery was such as to give rise to a moral obligation to pay reparations.
1.9.1. Pro: Where a government policy causes persistent and unjust harm to a group, the government accrues a moral obligation to make redress for the harm caused. This occurred with slavery, and the US has so far failed to properly compensate for the harms caused.
1.9.1.1. Con: The government isn't responsible for the actions of private citizens. It didn't own slaves; only private citizens actually owned them.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: Governments become complicit at best when they not only allow but take active steps to facilitate wrong things that their people do.
1.9.1.1.1.1. Pro: For example, after the Civil War, Mississippi implemented Vagrancy Laws which criminalized joblessness. These laws were only enforced against now-free Black men, and resulted in many people being [forced into slavery](https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Vagrancy_Act_of_1866), as slavery was still legal as punishment for a crime.
1.9.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.4.3.1.
1.9.1.1.3. Con: A dozen American Presidents [owned slaves while in office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_who_owned_slaves). Because the President is the United States' highest ranking elected official, this signals the government's stance towards slavery, even if it did not directly own slaves.
1.9.1.1.3.1. Con: The Clinton presidency does not signal the government's official stance toward marital infidelity.
1.9.1.2. Con: The United States is only a system. It is the people of history who controlled this system, who are responsible for its misuse. The system cannot be held liable for conditions that existed under it.
1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.9.3. Con: The US has already taken actions and/or changed in ways that deal sufficiently with its history with slavery.
1.9.3.1. Con: America still downplays the role that slavery played in its history and the evil that it was.
1.9.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.4.3.1.
1.9.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.4.3.2.
1.9.3.1.3. Pro: The Antebellum period - the period between American Independence and the Civil War, particularly associated with a southern plantation lifestyle - [continues to be glorified](https://www.bustle.com/articles/44052-blake-lively-website-preserve-editorial-called-allure-of-antebellum-is-absolutely-inexcusable) in the media and entertainment industry, despite the impossibility of separating the period and the lifestyle from the institution of slavery.
1.9.3.1.4. Con: It also completely ignores the kind of indentured servitude that other racial groups such as the Irish endured, and yet we do not use it as an excuse for them.
1.9.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.
1.9.3.3. Pro: The abolition movement was powerful from the moment of creation of the US. At the [Constitutional Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_\(United_States\)#Slavery) a major point of debate was slavery. This movement, while not successful at once, ultimately abolished slavery. This shows how abolitionism was part of the very foundation of the US.
1.9.3.4. Pro: Via the [American Colonization Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Colonization_Society), which received funding from Congress and several state legislatures, the United States supported the migration of free slaves to the African continent as well as the founding of Liberia as a colony that would provide a new homeland for them.
1.9.3.4.1. Con: The number of freed slaves who emigrated from the US to Liberia with the help of the American Colonization Society is estimated to have been around [15.000](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3p1521.html). In the context of millions of slaves in America, this is hardly a significant number or a significant redress.
1.9.3.5. Pro: In today's society and economy, the only things required to elevate oneself are smart choices, hard work and a bit of luck. Handing out reparations for historical wrong doings to appease the entitlements of a minority is the "soft bigotry of low expectations".
1.9.3.5.1. Con: Certain individuals born into hard circumstances can work their way out. At the population level, however, when one race has been substantially more impoverished than another for the 150 years since slavery ended, this is not a product of poor life choices and laziness. It is a consequence of 4 centuries of systemic disadvantages that are gradually improving but still exist.
1.9.3.5.1.1. Pro: Black Americans experience much more [downward intergenerational mobility](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/01/how-black-middle-class-kids-become-black-lower-class-adults/384613/) than white Americans. It is difficult to imagine how this can, on a society-wide level, be explained with a lack of effort and smart choices.
1.9.3.5.1.1.1. Con: Other data points explain the causal effect observed here. The rate of single-motherhood is extraordinary in the Black community as compared to every other racial group.
1.9.3.5.1.2. Con: Populations are made up of individuals. Each individual is responsible for themselves. Even if a population has been historically disadvantaged by systemic barriers, those barriers have been removed, leaving the individuals responsible and free to elevate themselves above their historical status unimpeded by active opposition.
1.9.3.5.1.2.1. Con: The claim, "those barriers have been removed" is false, the disadvantages non-white communities face are not merely historical as they continue today.
1.9.3.5.1.3. Con: Many African Americans have achieved great success in virtually every career field and at every level. [Larry Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Elder) and [Thomas Sowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sowell) are such people and they [discuss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oww-4wdrvgI) that a cultural victim mentality and not lack of opportunity is holding black Americans back. Reparations will not solve such a problem.
1.9.3.5.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.8.2.2.4.2.1.
1.9.3.5.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.5.8.2.2.4.2.2.
1.9.3.5.1.4. Con: -> See 1.5.8.2.2.
1.9.3.5.2. Con: Trauma becomes inter-generationally ingrained within communities that have faced systemic disempowerment. Childhood traumatic events \(CTEs\) cause developmental abnormalities, [nctsn.org](http://www.nctsn.org/trauma-types/complex-trauma/effects-of-complex-trauma), which get passed from parent to child as a result. Removing the health impacts of CTEs from a community takes 1\) multiple generations and 2\) absence of disempowerment.
1.9.3.6. Pro: The lifestyle of an American, with it's greater wealth than the reported countries from which slaves were imported, is payment in itself.
1.9.3.6.1. Con: Except that those benefits are enjoyed unequally, largely along lines of race.
1.9.3.6.2. Con: The 'lifestyle of Americans' was created, in substantial portion, through the contributions of slaves and people negatively impacted by slavery - and the current financial situation of people living with the impact of slavery does not meet their contributions to 'our' lifestyle.
1.9.3.7. Con: To imply that the mass murder of slaves brought over on slave ships could ever be dealt with sufficiently \(or made whole\), is to imply that somehow a death can be reversed. Which is impossible.
1.9.3.8. Pro: The NAACP \(National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\) and Affirmative Action both were intended to enhance the status of those primarily dealing with the aftereffects of slavery.
1.9.3.8.1. Con: Pointing to the existence of the NAACP doesn't show that society has changed, since the NAACP is a non-governmental advocacy group that seeks to rectify racial injustices. Indeed, the NAACP [supports](http://www.naacp.org/latest/naacp-supports-slavery-reparations-study-legislation-h-r-40-now-pending-in/) exploring the idea that reparations are needed.
1.9.3.9. Pro: Black Americans have been compensated for disadvantage through past social spending programs, thus obviating the need for reparations.
1.9.3.9.1. Pro: Nearly 60% of Black American women have at least once received income from welfare \([Moffitt & Gottschlak, p. 159](https://www.nap.edu/read/9719/chapter/8#153)\).
1.9.3.9.1.1. Con: The data cited covers a very limited and now quite outdated range \(1985-1992\). This predates the "welfare reform" of the late 90s and tax cuts of the early 2000s, both of which greatly changed income and benefit flow in the US.
1.9.3.9.1.2. Con: Over 40% of white American women have at least once received income from welfare. The discrepancy is not nearly enough to compensate for the harms caused by slavery.
1.9.3.9.1.3. Con: The data cited is not for all women, but all women between the ages of 15-44.
1.9.3.9.1.3.1. Con: Female [labor force participation](http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_303.htm) of the age group 15-44 is among the highest. Thus, the limitation to this reduces the percentage of welfare transfers.
1.9.3.9.1.4. Con: The data cited includes SSI \(Supplemental Security Income\) or Social Security.  At some point, nearly all Americans will receive some form of social security benefits.
1.9.3.9.1.4.1. Pro: The total number of Americans receiving welfare government assistance in 2015 is [67,891,000](http://www.statisticbrain.com/welfare-statistics/) \(does not include 70.5 million people enrolled in Medicaid\).
1.9.3.9.2. Pro: According to [Pew Research](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/12/the-politics-and-demographics-of-food-stamp-recipients/), 31% of Black adults have received food stamps - compared to 15% of whites - over their lifetime.
1.9.3.9.2.1. Con: Just because a higher proportion of Black Americans than white Americans have used food stamps, it does not follow that more Blacks than whites benefit from food stamps, because whites outnumber Blacks in the U.S. by a large margin.
1.9.3.9.2.1.1. Con: Using proportion, it actually does follow that blacks receive proportionally more benefit than whites from food stamps. 31% of the 12% of black adults that make up the population is a smaller number than 15% of the 70% of whites, but it is a higher proportion.
1.9.3.9.2.2. Con: Primarily wealthy middle-class white Americans receive government assistance as dignified entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare. However, Black Americans are often [considered undeserving recipients](https://academic.udayton.edu/race/04needs/welfare01d.htm) of public charity such as food stamps and government housing.
1.9.3.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.9.
1.9.3.9.4. Con: Social spending programs are not sufficiently large to compensate for the financially disadvantaged situation of African-Americans.
1.9.3.9.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.6.5.1.
1.9.3.9.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.2.
1.9.3.9.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.8.1.
1.9.3.9.4.4. Pro: Welfare does not add up to the amount of wealth stolen by slavery, even if it counted towards reparations.
1.9.3.9.4.4.1. Con: Compare the status of US blacks to black Africans and you will see that black Africans are far worse off. It would seem that there was in fact an amount of wealth given, not stolen.
1.9.3.9.4.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.9.2.
1.9.3.9.4.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.4.3.2.
1.9.3.9.4.4.1.3. Con: This begs the question of how much of the present-day prosperity of the United States is due to slavery.
1.9.3.9.5. Con: Welfare does not qualify as reparations as it is different in nature and motivation to pay.
1.9.3.9.5.1. Con: Welfare is an attempt to rectify a myriad of socio-economic factors. This includes slavery. This concept was in mind during its inception. It is clear that LBJ had an agenda of rectifying racial injustice. He enacted both the Civil Rights Act and expanded welfare. Needless to say, an attempt to remedy poverty of all factors includes echoes of slavery.
1.9.3.9.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.8.3.1.1.
1.9.3.9.5.2. Pro: Welfare is not considered reparations for Black Americans, as it is a system put in place to help those in need, without mention of it being for the primary benefit of a particular race.
1.9.3.9.5.3. Pro: Welfare payments are not exclusive to those who suffer the ongoing burdens of America's history of racism, and as such do not act as compensation.
1.9.3.9.5.3.1. Con: While not identical to reparations, welfare payments actually accomplish the goal behind reparations better than reparations would.
1.9.3.9.5.3.1.1. Pro: Even though they would not be exclusive to Black Americans, welfare payments would still benefit them disproportionally due to America's inequalities in wealth.
1.9.3.9.5.3.1.2. Pro: Welfare payments would serve the goal of treating everyone equally and not erect new barriers between races.
1.9.3.9.6. Con: Over the years, social programs designed to financially benefit disadvantaged communities have excluded African-Americans.
1.9.3.9.6.1. Pro: The first [maternalist](https://academic.udayton.edu/race/04needs/welfare01b.htm) welfare legislation was intended for white mothers only. Black single mothers, on the other hand, were simply excluded.
1.9.3.9.6.2. Pro: When President Roosevelt signed Social Security into law in 1935, 65 percent of African Americans nationally and between 70 and 80 percent in the South [were ineligible](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/).
1.9.3.9.6.2.1. Pro: Old-age insurance \(Social Security proper\) and unemployment insurance under Roosevelt's New Deal [excluded](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/) farm workers and domestics - jobs heavily occupied by Blacks.
1.9.3.9.6.3. Pro: African-Americans were barred from the benefits of the oft-lauded G.I. Bill of 1944, further widening the economic gap between white and Black Americans.
1.9.3.9.6.3.1. Pro: In New York and northern New Jersey, "fewer than 100 of the 67,000 mortgages insured by the G.I. Bill supported home purchases [by nonwhites](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/books/review/when-affirmative-action-was-white-uncivil-rights.html?_r=0)."
1.9.3.9.6.3.2. Pro: Most African-American G.I.s were [channeled](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/books/review/when-affirmative-action-was-white-uncivil-rights.html?_r=0) toward traditional, low-paying "black jobs" and under-financed small Black colleges.
1.9.3.9.6.3.2.1. Pro: The University of Pennsylvania, one of the least discriminatory Ivy League schools, [enrolled](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/books/review/when-affirmative-action-was-white-uncivil-rights.html?_r=0) only 46 Black students in its student body of 9,000 in 1946 \(with similar statistics in surrounding years\).
1.9.3.9.6.3.2.2. Pro: There were [estimated 70,000](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/books/review/when-affirmative-action-was-white-uncivil-rights.html?_r=0) Black veterans seeking to enroll in college in 1947, and historically Black colleges did not have capacity to educate them all.
1.9.3.9.6.3.2.3. Pro: At the same time, white universities were [doubling their enrollments](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/books/review/when-affirmative-action-was-white-uncivil-rights.html?_r=0) and prospering with the infusion of public and private funds, and of students with their G.I. benefits.
1.9.3.9.6.4. Pro: The primary beneficiaries of the New Deal \(often [explicitly](https://www.thenation.com/article/race-and-new-deal-coalition/)\) were whites.
1.9.3.9.7. Con: Social spending programs, even when they benefit Black Americans, benefit white Americans more, thereby further increasing the disparity in wealth.
1.9.3.9.7.1. Con: As there are more than fives times as many white Americans than Black Americans, it is only logical that a larger sum of social spending goes to them. The individual white American is not necessarily advantaged by that.
1.9.3.9.7.2. Pro: It would be odd to argue that programs that give more money on the whole to non-Black Americans than to Black Americans take the place of reparations. Indeed, the [plurality](http://kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/distribution-by-raceethnicity-4/?currentTimeframe=0&selectedRows=%7B%22wrapups%22:%7B%22united-states%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) of Medicaid recipients are white, and the majority are non-Black.
1.9.3.9.7.3. Pro: White Americans benefit from public institutions more than Black Americans. White Americans represent [70%](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2010/2010015/tables/table_24_1.asp) of the university student body and therewith receive more state assistance to access higher education.
1.9.3.9.7.4. Pro: The [plurality](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/28/food-stamp-demographics_n_6771938.html) of food stamp beneficiaries are white, and the majority are non-Black.
1.9.3.9.7.4.1. Con: -> See 1.9.3.9.2.
1.9.3.9.8. Con: So-called welfare reform in the 1990s has [effectively ended](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/22/the-enduring-legacy-of-welfare-reform-20-years-later/) much of the poverty alleviation of the late 20th century welfare state.
1.9.3.10. Pro: The US fought a war about ending slavery. That should be reparation enough.
1.9.3.10.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.1.
1.9.3.10.2. Con: Black soldiers joined unionists to fight for their freedom. It was not white American citizens alone who fought to end slavery.
1.9.3.10.2.1. Pro: By the end of the Civil War, around [10%](https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/blacks-civil-war), or 180,000 members, of the Union army were Black soldiers.
1.9.3.10.2.2. Pro: Around [20,000](https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/blacks-civil-war) Black sailors were part of the Union navy.
1.9.3.10.2.3. Con: White Americans also fought in the war. Their descendants should not be penalized for slavery. That would be a great injustice to the people who fought and died to liberate the slaves.
1.9.3.10.2.4. Con: This statement does not rebut the point that it responds to. The US fought a war to end slavery, and the reparations for slavery was the blood spilled by participants of any race on either side.
1.9.3.10.3. Con: Only one part of the United States fought the war in the name of slavery; the other fought it in the name of continuing it.
1.9.3.10.3.1. Pro: Roughly [half the casualties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) of the Civil War occurred on the side of the Confederacy.
1.9.3.10.3.1.1. Pro: It is odd to regard their deaths as part of the calculus for the U.S. attempting to end the evil of slavery.
1.9.3.10.3.2. Con: The fact that the Union fought at all still matters. At the time, the US was perceived similarly to the modern-day EU, where each individual state was largely autonomous and there was little emphasis placed on "the union." The fact that North fought to retain the union is more indicative of their desire to end slavery than their desire to preserve the union.
1.9.3.10.3.3. Con: The vast majority of Americans stood on the side of those fighting in the name of abolishing slavery. Excluding slaves, the Union states had about three times the population of the states belonging to the Confederacy \([18.5 vs. 5.5 Million](https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/facts.htm)\).
1.9.3.10.3.4. Pro: The Civil War was not only fought against slavery, but also with the help [of slavery](http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/slavery_during_the_civil_war): "slave labor provided the physical cornerstone for the Confederate war effort".
1.9.3.10.3.4.1. Pro: Additionally, [tens of thousands](http://blog.oup.com/2012/04/black-white-demographic-death-toll-civil-war/) of slaves died over the course of the Civil War, for example from being shot or illnesses.
1.9.3.10.3.5. Pro: More than half of the direct and indirect cost of the Civil War [was incurred by the South](https://www.princeton.edu/rpds/papers/Golding_Lewis_Economic_Cost_of_American_Civil_War_JEH1975.pdf) \(p. 308, 317\), and thus on the side of those who fought to preserve slavery. This cost can hardly be seen as a cost paid by the United States to end slavery.
1.9.3.10.4. Pro: The United States has already borne a huge cost in ridding itself of slavery: roughly [750,000 lives](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/science/civil-war-toll-up-by-20-percent-in-new-estimate.html?mcubz=1).
1.9.3.10.4.1. Pro: The Union Military consisted of over 2 million soldiers, with Union fatalities around [400,000](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/civil-war-facts) persons. The US thus purged itself of slavery at an incredible cost.
1.9.3.10.4.2. Pro: More Americans died in the Civil War [than in any other war](http://necrometrics.com/warsusa.htm) that the United States participated in. Even the American death toll of World War 2 was exceeded by half.
1.9.3.10.4.3. Con: While this was a tremendous cost to the U.S., it was not an expenditure that provided any reparations to Black Americans, and thus irrelevant to the question of the debt owed there.
1.9.3.10.4.4. Con: -> See 1.9.3.10.3.1.
1.9.3.10.5. Con: Ending slavery was discontinuing an injustice. It does not at all pay for the harms slavery caused prior to the war.
1.9.3.10.5.1. Con: The blood toll serves as indication that a society was willing to give more than just financial compensation.
1.9.3.10.5.1.1. Pro: Giving one's life in defense of a cause is a form of payment that is more costly, arguably, than most other forms.
1.9.3.10.5.1.1.1. Con: While this may be a cost, it does not provide any recompense, which is what reparations aim to do.
1.9.3.10.5.1.2. Con: The society wasn't making this sacrifice solely for the benefit of the slaves, but also for the benefit of its own self image and conscience, so it hardly counts as payment.
1.9.3.10.5.1.3. Con: -> See 1.9.3.10.3.
1.9.3.10.5.2. Pro: The amount of harm that was done to slaves for decades prior to the abolition of slavery could not have been paid for by three years of fighting.
1.9.3.10.5.2.1. Con: Such an unquantified argument leads to the slippery slope of slaves deserving any amount of reparation that they could demand, based on their immeasurable suffering. This is clearly untenable.
1.9.3.10.5.2.1.1. Con: Even if the complete scope of the debt could not be discharged, it does not follow that some of that debt should be discharged. Indeed, to assert that the demand for limited reparations would lead to a demand for unlimited reparations is an example of the slippery slope [fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope).
1.9.3.10.5.3. Con: Stopping slavery, even if it didn't pay for all what slavery did, at least prevented much of it from continuing, and that is important.
1.9.3.10.5.3.1. Pro: More slaves would have died had the Civil War not taken place when it did or had it not resulted in the Union win.
1.9.3.10.5.3.2. Con: What came after \(i.e. Reconstruction\) arguably made life worse for Black American ex-slaves.
1.9.3.10.5.3.3. Con: Discontinuing your own moral crimes is not a moral good, it is merely morally neutral. There is still a massive moral debt that remains.
1.9.3.10.5.3.4. Con: While this may be important to the general moral standing of the United States, it is irrelevant to the question of reparations, which is what is at issue here.
1.9.3.10.6. Con: Once Slavery was abolished, the government payed the Slave owners reconciliation for 'loss of property'
1.9.3.10.7. Pro: With the exception of the two World Wars, [no other war](https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/c/costs-major-us-wars.html) fought by America was as expensive in relative terms \(and in relation to the country's GDP\) as the Civil War.
1.9.3.10.7.1. Con: -> See 1.9.3.10.3.5.
1.9.3.10.7.2. Con: The cost of the civil war was nowhere near the economic benefit the US gained from slavery. Studies that take into account the direct as well as the indirect costs of the war come to final costs in the range of [21 billion dollars](https://www.princeton.edu/rpds/papers/Golding_Lewis_Economic_Cost_of_American_Civil_War_JEH1975.pdf) \(p. 304, 308, 317\).
1.9.3.10.7.2.1. Pro: The value of the labor taken from slaves has been estimated at [7-40 billion dollars](http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/blj/vol20/feagin.pdf) \(p.15\), a number that increases substantially once the lost interest earnings from then until today are taken into account.
1.9.3.10.7.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.3.10.3.5.
1.9.3.10.7.2.3. Con: The cost of the war goes beyond its economic expenditure and damage. It also had a massive human and emotional cost as the [deadliest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) of all American wars with about one million casualties.
1.9.3.10.7.2.3.1. Con: Valuing the lives of those who fought the war \(which included freed slaves\) while not valuing the loss of life as a result of the injustice of slavery is hypocritical
1.9.3.10.7.3. Con: The expenditure for the Civil War does not match the costs of slavery and therewith does not outweigh it.
1.9.3.10.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.3.10.7.2.
1.9.3.10.7.3.2. Pro: Fewer people died in the US civil war than from slavery. In the Civil War around [600,000](http://necrometrics.com/warsusa.htm) died while there are estimates that put the death toll of slaves at more than [one million](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/18/jon-stewart/jon-stewart-slave-trade-caused-5-million-deaths/).
1.9.3.10.7.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.3.10.3.4.1.
1.9.3.10.7.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.3.10.3.5.
1.9.3.10.8. Con: The Union understood the necessity of [Reconstruction](http://www.howard.edu/library/reference/guides/reconstructionera/) after the war to really redress the evils of slavery. But Reconstruction was a [failure](http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/janfeb-2013/deconstructing-reconstruction/).
1.9.3.11. Con: After the abolition of slavery, the US government made, and has continued to make, a number of policy decisions that actively exacerbated the disadvantaged position of Black Americans.
1.9.3.11.1. Con: Blacks in America have been given equal rights under the law, and also been given social benefits such as affirmative action that actually come at the disadvantage other racial groups.
1.9.3.11.1.1. Con: While given equal rights de jure, in practice, there are [innumerable examples](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/new-voting-laws-south-could-affect-millions-african-americans-n639511) of how laws and norms hurt Black people.
1.9.3.11.1.2. Pro: Affirmative action is a form of reparations. They are given preference in opportunity which has a financial benefit to them in aggregate.
1.9.3.11.2. Pro: [Redlining in housing policy in many US cities](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/), promoted by the Federal Housing Authority, systematically ghettoised the African American Community and cut them off from investment and capital. This combined with the legacy of slavery to create even more disadvantages for African Americans and thus imposes more of an obligation on the US government.
1.9.3.11.3. Pro: Immediately following abolition, former slaves in the South were promised '[40 acres and a mule](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/the-truth-behind-40-acres-and-a-mule/)' and land was seized from planters for this purpose. The subsequent administration, however, went back on this and returned the land to former slave owners, kicking off the settled former slaves in the process.
1.9.3.11.4. Pro: Voting rights for African-Americans were restricted even after the abolition of slavery; and for some, barriers to voting still persist in the form of voter ID laws.
1.9.3.11.4.1. Pro: [Gerrymandering](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/08/03/courts-are-finally-pointing-out-the-racism-behind-voter-id-laws/?utm_term=.646caa4daa46) is sometimes used to limit the influence of Black Americans.
1.9.3.11.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.1.
1.9.3.11.4.3. Pro: Through the use of poll taxes, literacy tests and other means, Southern states were able to effectively disenfranchise African Americans until the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
1.9.3.11.4.4. Pro: Modern voter ID laws disproportionately disenfranchise African-Americans.
1.9.3.11.4.4.1. Pro: Voter ID laws in [North Carolina](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/08/03/courts-are-finally-pointing-out-the-racism-behind-voter-id-laws/?utm_term=.646caa4daa46) were struck down because they were found to be racist.
1.9.3.11.4.4.2. Pro: Sometimes state laws prohibit certain [electoral mechanisms](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/08/03/courts-are-finally-pointing-out-the-racism-behind-voter-id-laws/?utm_term=.646caa4daa46), such as early voting, same-day registration and out-of-precinct voting. These are mostly used by Black Americans.
1.9.3.11.4.4.3. Pro: [Voter identification requirements](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/08/03/courts-are-finally-pointing-out-the-racism-behind-voter-id-laws/?utm_term=.646caa4daa46) favor white Americans as they are more likely to hold driver licenses, passports or military IDs. In contrast, government assistance IDs are sometimes not allowed.
1.9.3.11.5. Pro: -> See 1.9.3.9.6.
1.9.4. Pro: The US carries a [collective guilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_responsibility) and therefore needs to pay reparations.
1.9.4.1. Con: Many whites helped slaves to escape. Their descendants do not carry guilt.
1.9.4.1.1. Pro: Many [Quakers](http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/article/2008/11/20081112170035abretnuh3.838748e-02.html#axzz4QBIj8TKu) played a role in the abolition of slavery. Their descendants are not likely to carry guilt.
1.9.4.1.2. Pro: Abolitionist [John Brown](http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/biographies/john-brown.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/) was a noted 'conductor' of the Underground Railroad and established an organization called the League of Gileadites, helping runaway slaves escape to Canada.
1.9.4.1.3. Con: Individual positive acts have not relieved collective guilt of a society in other historical examples.
1.9.4.1.3.1. Pro: The acts of German saints for thousands of doomed, such as [Oskar Schindler](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler) for Jews or [John Rabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rabe) for the Chinese, did nothing to alleviate the collective guilt of Germany for the Holocaust.
1.9.4.1.3.2. Pro: Some men further the cause of women's emancipation but this did nothing to end the claim that men carry a collective responsibility for female subordination in modern society \([Branscoombe and Doosje, ch. 5](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=de&lr=&id=cS5fqn3KJKIC&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=Collective+guilt:+International+perspectives&ots=dplxylndq2&sig=0HC7azrqLRO-JUS7mh-i0eH7TX0#v=onepage&q=Collective%20guilt%3A%20International%20perspectives&f=false)\).
1.9.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.13.2.1.
1.9.4.3. Con: Collective guilt is void because it assigns equal responsibility to everyone where, in fact, not everyone contributed to the institution of slavery in equal terms.
1.9.4.3.1. Pro: Plantation owners owned more slaves and profited more from them than poor Southerners. In North Carolina, slave owning families accounted for only [27%](http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-antebellum/5347#note4) of all families. Blame should be assigned more heavily to those who profited the most from slavery.
1.9.4.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.3.2.
1.9.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.13.3.2.
1.9.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.9.4.3.4. Con: -> See 1.2.13.3.5.
1.9.4.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.3.
1.9.4.4. Pro: The US caused tremendous suffering to the slaves.
1.9.4.4.1. Pro: [Punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_of_slaves_in_the_United_States#Punishment_and_abuse) was severe and included painful death penalties.
1.9.4.4.2. Pro: Brutality was especially common and widespread on [big plantations](https://www.boundless.com/u-s-history/textbooks/boundless-u-s-history-textbook/slavery-in-the-antebellum-u-s-1820-1840-16/slavery-in-the-u-s-122/treatment-of-slaves-in-the-united-states-652-9460/).
1.9.4.4.3. Pro: [Working conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_of_slaves_in_the_United_States) were long and reached up to 15 hours per day.
1.9.4.4.3.1. Con: Historically, these working hours are not extraordinary. Factory workers during the Industrial Revolution in Britain equally worked [12-14 hours a day](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/shp/britishsociety/livingworkingconditionsrev1.shtml) or more.
1.9.4.4.4. Pro: Slaves were denied the opportunity for [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_of_slaves_in_the_United_States) in order to reduce the risk of rebellion.
1.9.4.4.5. Con: Some argue that slaves lived in a better condition than [white laborers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_of_slaves_in_the_United_States#In_comparison_to_non-slaves) at the time.
1.9.4.4.5.1. Con: The research that this view is premised on is flawed, relying too heavily on economic data at the expense of other social data. Consequently, it likely [overstates](https://academicinexile.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/classic-review-11-slavery-and-the-numbers-game/) its case.
1.9.4.4.5.2. Con: Even Robert Fogel, the primary historian to make this claim, [backed away from it subsequently in light of better research](http://eh.net/book_reviews/time-on-the-cross-the-economics-of-american-negro-slavery/). This claim has largely been discredited.
1.9.4.4.6. Con: The conditions of slavery were better in North America than in South America.
1.9.4.4.6.1. Pro: Slaves in South America had to produce their own [food](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/origins-slavery/resources/american-slavery-comparative-perspective) in their free time.
1.9.4.4.6.2. Pro: Compared to the British West Indies, a different master-slave relationship evolved, as plantation owners were generally absent while in North America the slave owner lived in close proximity to them \([Miller & Smith, p. 7](https://books.google.de/books?id=idktzKdgb7YC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=absentee+ownership+plantations+slave+life&source=bl&ots=9WjBjZDhby&sig=e8sXOVeUtGlSMEPExasQj4ZvDQk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxqYiftYjTAhUrKMAKHRmPBr8Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=absentee%20ownership%20plantations%20slave%20life&f=false)\).
1.9.4.4.6.2.1. Pro: Absentee owners will deal with numbers rather than humans much like [modern board members](https://hbr.org/2013/09/plantations-practiced-modern-management) in a company. This makes it easy to forget the human consequences of decisions on food, healthcare or worship.
1.9.4.4.6.2.1.1. Pro: Accounting as a practice of management was more widespread in the British West Indies than in the South of the US \([Fleischmann et al., p. 19](http://aeca.es/old/vi_encuentro_trabajo_historia_contabilidad/pdf/p1_fleischman.pdf)\).
1.9.4.4.6.2.1.2. Pro: Slaves were treated as 'stock' in accounting books and not as 'labor' indicating that some loss was viewed as inevitable \([Cowtong & Shaugenessy, p. 41](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00014788.1991.9729415?journalCode=rabr20)\).
1.9.4.4.6.2.2. Con: In the 1830s, absentee ownership increased to 50% of plantations in the South of the US \([Miller & Smith, p. 8](https://books.google.de/books?id=idktzKdgb7YC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=absentee+ownership+plantations+slave+life&source=bl&ots=9WjBjZDhby&sig=e8sXOVeUtGlSMEPExasQj4ZvDQk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxqYiftYjTAhUrKMAKHRmPBr8Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=absentee%20ownership%20plantations%20slave%20life&f=false)\).
1.9.4.4.6.2.2.1. Con: Measured as percentage of total slave population the percentage of owners who were absentee never reached far beyond 10% \([Miller & Smith, p. 8](https://books.google.de/books?id=idktzKdgb7YC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=absentee+ownership+plantations+slave+life&source=bl&ots=9WjBjZDhby&sig=e8sXOVeUtGlSMEPExasQj4ZvDQk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxqYiftYjTAhUrKMAKHRmPBr8Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=absentee%20ownership%20plantations%20slave%20life&f=false)\).
1.9.4.4.6.2.3. Pro: Punishments were harder when slave owners did not live on the plantation \([Miller &Smith, p. 9](https://books.google.de/books?id=idktzKdgb7YC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=absentee+ownership+plantations+slave+life&source=bl&ots=9WjBjZDhby&sig=e8sXOVeUtGlSMEPExasQj4ZvDQk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxqYiftYjTAhUrKMAKHRmPBr8Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=absentee%20ownership%20plantations%20slave%20life&f=false)\).
1.9.4.4.6.3. Con: Instances of extreme suffering cannot be compared.
1.9.4.4.6.3.1. Con: Extreme suffering is comparable. A thousand lashes are less horrible than a hundred, for example.
1.9.4.4.6.3.1.1. Pro: Rules are in place regarding methods of state execution, despite the end result. The reason is to minimize suffering.
1.9.4.4.6.3.2. Con: Punishment was much more widespread in the British West Indies than in the South of the US \([Fleischmann, p. 12](http://aeca.es/old/vi_encuentro_trabajo_historia_contabilidad/pdf/p1_fleischman.pdf)\)
1.9.4.4.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.9.4.4.6.3.2.
1.9.4.4.6.5. Con: The [Middle Passage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Passage) and its hazards was same for slaves whether they were deported to South or North America afterwards.
1.9.4.4.6.6. Pro: The [death to fertility rate](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/slavery-and-anti-slavery/resources/facts-about-slave-trade-and-slavery) in South America was so abysmal that 'imports' were necessary to sustain the slave population. In contrast, the US slave population kept its size without imports.
1.9.4.4.6.7. Con: This does not make the treatment of slaves in the United States any less cruel.
1.9.4.4.7. Con: [South Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_of_slaves_in_the_United_States#Punishment_and_abuse) passed a law that prohibited cruelty to slaves in 1740.
1.9.4.4.7.1. Con: While this law may have legally prohibited some extremely egregious cases, it hardly ended cruelty towards enslaved individuals. Indeed, the [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro_Act_of_1740) also greatly circumscribed enslaved individuals rights to movement, property and assembly and permitted owners to kill slaves in the case of insurrection.
1.9.4.4.7.2. Con: Focusing on the laws on the books without discussing actual practices ignores the narratives of enslaved individuals themselves. [Moses Roper](http://spartacus-educational.com/USASroper.htm), who escaped slavery in 1834, tells of a [slaveowner](http://spartacus-educational.com/USASpunishments.htm) in South Carolina who would "drive nails into a hogshead so as to leave the point of the nail just protruding in the inside of the cask. Into this he used to put his slaves for punishment, and roll them down a very long and steep hill."
1.9.4.4.7.3. Con: Slavery itself is a form of cruelty.
1.9.4.4.8. Pro: Slave owners were allowed to do whatever they wanted to their slaves including beating them, raping them and stealing their children from them to be sold as slaves.
1.9.4.4.8.1. Pro: Many women were '[sex slaves](https://www.boundless.com/u-s-history/textbooks/boundless-u-s-history-textbook/slavery-in-the-antebellum-u-s-1820-1840-16/slavery-in-the-u-s-122/treatment-of-slaves-in-the-united-states-652-9460/)' to their masters, who could rape them at will.
1.9.4.4.8.2. Pro: Most notably, Dr. J. Marion Sims performed [gynecological surgery experiments](http://usslave.blogspot.com/2011/05/dr-j-marion-sims-medical-experiments-on.html) on female slaves without their consent. In some cases, this resulted in their deaths.
1.9.4.4.9. Pro: Apprenticeship laws kept free Black children bound as laborers, depriving parents of the right to raise their children and benefiting from the labor their children would have contributed to their families [\(Tolman, p. 12\).](http://www.leaveafamilylegacy.com/African_American_Families.pdf)
1.9.4.5. Con: Collective guilt as a concept is void because responsibility is assigned to individuals based on their belonging to an ethnic group.
1.9.4.5.1. Con: Corporations or states, who comprise many individuals, are responsible for their actions too. This is a form of collective responsibility.
1.9.4.5.1.1. Pro: The collective guilt in this case is assigned to the United States as a nation, not to exclusively one ethnic group, for example white American citizens.
1.9.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: Any reparations would, therefore, be financed by America as a whole and through the taxes paid by its citizens, not by white Americans only.
1.9.4.5.2. Pro: The 1949 Geneva Conventions lists collective punishments as a war crime in [article 33](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/9861b8c2f0e83ed3c1256403003fb8c5/72728b6de56c7a68c12563cd0051bc40).
1.9.4.5.3. Pro: Collective guilt means that there is a moral obligation for the individual to feel responsibility and endure moral punishment by the mere fact of belonging to an ethnic group. This is unfair.
1.9.4.5.3.1. Con: It is natural and typical for the wrongs of one portion of a society to have a negative impact on those close to it, particularly family and heirs. From an individualistic perspective, it may seem unfair, but from a family or community perspective it is only common sense.
1.9.4.5.3.2. Pro: If this practice were to take place today, the majority of blacks should be held accountable for their [increased rate of committing crimes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_crime_in_the_United_States).
1.9.4.5.3.3. Con: Collective guilt does not necessarily equal guilt in a legal, punishable sense; it can also describe guilt in a moral sense and with a focus on shame. Subsequently, collective guilt has received interpretations apart from legal guilt, for example as a motivational state and the intention to accept, apologize, restore and compensate \([Schmitt et al., p. 77f.](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=cS5fqn3KJKIC&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=collective+guilt+definition&source=bl&ots=dpmounlkt5&sig=hYvlFlOWHbo7THQs1hEJRHNUp8c&hl=de&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwiypvWyvMPQAhXJkJQKHa1XBtgQ6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&q=collective%20guilt%20definition&f=false)\).
1.9.4.6. Con: If a country views itself as fundamentally and uniquely 'guilty' then that cannot be good for the national spirit.
1.9.4.6.1. Con: Other countries consider themselves guilty of crimes - and even as fundamentally and unique guilty - yet do not seem to suffer from a diminished national spirit, for example Germany.
1.9.4.6.2. Con: A country living with a myth of innocence that goes against everything that country asserts to stand for cannot be healthy for the national spirit in the long run either.
1.9.4.7. Pro: A  prerequisite to feelings of collective guilt is a strong identity link to the perpetrator population \([Ferguson & Brandscobe, p. 252](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nyla_Branscombe/publication/262862728_The_social_psychology_of_collective_guilt/links/0deec539b23e35e501000000.pdf)\). Americans identify strongly with the [Founding Fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_who_owned_slaves) who owned slaves too.
1.9.4.8. Pro: Whites who hold a strong belief that their [privileged position](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255172712_White_Guilt_and_Racial_Compensation_The_Benefits_and_Limits_of_Self-Focus) was accrued through racial inequality feel a greater collective guilt for these inequalities. This suggests that a portion of the US is feeling a collective guilt.
1.9.4.8.1. Con: Feeling guilty doesn't necessarily mean that someone is actually guilty, i.e. morally responsible. There are many examples of this. Consider the widely known phenomena of "survivor's guilt," when someone who survived a traumatic incident, through sheer luck, feels guilty because they survived while their friends didn't.
1.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.9.4.4.
1.9.6. Con: The US did not cause the problem of slavery and therefore has no principal moral obligation.
1.9.6.1. Con: The US' culpability comes from practicing and perpetuating slavery, irrespective of the initial cause of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
1.9.6.1.1. Pro: From approximately 1776 - 1865, the United States independently benefited from the labor of slaves. \(From independence to the end of the civil war.\)
1.9.6.2. Con: While the U.S. did not cause slavery in general, it did create specific institutions that promoted and perpetuated \(and in this way caused\) specific forms of slavery.
1.9.6.3. Pro: Those who captured slaves in Africa and their descendants carry principal responsibility.
1.9.6.3.1. Con: Sometimes Europeans [intoxicated](http://www.recoveredhistories.org/pamphlet1.php?page=1&orderby=MaxID&catid=32&page=23) local African kings to extract slaves from them.
1.9.6.3.1.1. Con: By this logic, a bartender is responsible for every bad decision his customers make after he served them alcohol.
1.9.6.3.1.1.1. Con: This is analogy is not helpful. In the United States, people who serve alcohol can actually [be held responsible](https://www.injuryrelief.com/blog/why-the-law-makes-bars-liable-for-drunks/) for the misconduct of drunk individuals.
1.9.6.3.1.2. Con: This however puts the onus on European countries and not on the US. This makes this statement irrelevant to the initial discussion.
1.9.6.3.2. Pro: The slaves themselves were not captured by Americans but by Africans.
1.9.6.3.2.1. Con: Those who own slaves are equally responsible as those who initially caught them. America, after all, had a choice over whether to purchase, sell, use and abuse slaves enslaved in Africa.
1.9.6.3.2.1.1. Con: It was not long after gaining independence that the US took steps to leave the slave trade with the [Slave Trade Act of 1794](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_Trade_Act_of_1794).
1.9.6.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.3.10.
1.9.6.3.2.1.1.2. Con: The Slave Trade Act was completely [ineffective](http://www.slavevoyages.org/documents/download/2010-estimates-excel.xlsx), as about half of all slaves were imported into the US after the Act.
1.9.6.3.2.1.1.3. Con: While the US took steps to fight against international slave trade there were no steps made to fight [domestic trade](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/slavery-and-anti-slavery/resources/facts-about-slave-trade-and-slavery). This indicates a will to continue the system.
1.9.6.3.2.2. Con: The majority of the damage done to slaves' and their families was not done by the captors but the owners and institutions that continued to disenfranchise and oppress them for several generations.
1.9.6.3.2.3. Con: Vast numbers of America's slaves were born in America as the offspring of slaves and into slavery. Between 1808, when the United States outlawed the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and 1860, the population of slaves thus increased "naturally" from 1 to 4 million \([Rodriguez, p. 12](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=4X44KbDBl9gC&pg=RA1-PA123&lpg=RA1-PA123&dq=slave+population+%22natural+increase%22&source=bl&ots=IvYaXq_hVV&sig=okfNk-_Lc_qPENtynIs7LS9Jh1c&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiuvpzP0cDQAhXFoZQKHYILAUQQ6AEISjAH#v=onepage&q=slave%20population%20%22natural%20increase%22&f=false)\).
1.9.6.3.2.4. Con: If there had not been demand for slavery on the territory of today's United States, there would have been little incentive to capture people in the first place.
1.9.6.3.2.4.1. Con: If there hadn't been a flourishing slave trade in Africa, people wouldn't have thought to bring them to America.
1.9.6.3.2.4.1.1. Con: Assigning the origin of enslavement in the New World to the extant slave trade in Africa is historically false. Europeans had already [enslaved](http://nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/332) Native Americans prior to the Transatlantic slave trade.  The Transatlantic slave trade began to [replace](http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/archaeology/background/) the enslaved populations in the New World after disease and genocide wiped out Native American populations.
1.9.6.3.2.4.2. Con: Only [6%](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/slavery-and-anti-slavery/resources/facts-about-slave-trade-and-slavery) of slaves 'exported' from Africa were destined for British North America, with the majority going to the Caribbean and South America.
1.9.6.3.2.5. Con: Throughout most of the history of the United States \(from 1808 on\) the [international slave trade](http://abolition.nypl.org/essays/us_slave_trade/) was illegal. Even prior to this, most slaves brought to the United States came from the Caribbean.
1.9.6.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.13.3.3.2.1.
1.9.6.3.4. Pro: If reparations were to be paid, the US should pay only after the nations of Africa whose ancestors captured the slaves, and only after nations of Arabs and southern and western Europeans who traded for and transported the slaves, then the other nations of the new world could be asked to pay, not just the US.
1.9.6.3.5. Con: -> See 1.9.6.3.2.3.
1.9.6.3.6. Pro: If it had not been for [tribal and cultural warfare](https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/41431), most Blacks would not have been in slavery.
1.9.6.4. Con: Based on this logic, perpetrators of all kinds of other injustices would be free from responsibility. Nazi-Germany and Europe's colonial powers, for example, could have pointed at anti-semitism and the exploitation of foreign lands as being well-established and long-standing traditions.
1.9.6.4.1. Pro: Just because an actor did not cause a problem does not mean that they can exacerbate it and not take any moral responsibility. Perpetuating the issue also carries weight because of its effects on other actors or situations.
1.9.6.4.2. Con: The Nazi comparison is void as the starting positions were different. The US inherited slavery structures, while the Nazis built them.
1.9.6.5. Pro: African nations such as Ghana and Senegal should pay reparations to African Americans for selling their own people into slavery.
1.9.6.5.1. Con: The analogy between the responsibility of the US to the responsibility of Ghana or Senegal does not hold because of the differing histories of these nations. While the United States has existed as a political entity since before the abolition of slavery, Ghana and Senegal have not.
1.9.6.5.1.1. Con: If political continuity is the requirement for a moral obligation to pay reparations, many countries generally assumed to have that obligation would have been free from it, for example West Germany which wasn't the same political entity that committed the crimes of the Nazi era.
1.9.6.5.2. Pro: Some of the main dominant tribes and clans in those African countries then \(before they became modern nation states out of colonialism\) are still the dominant tribes and clans there now. They rose to power over others and remained in power by conquering and selling off other tribes. Though political systems have changed, many of the same tribal families are still in power there.
1.9.6.6. Con: -> See 1.9.6.3.2.4.
1.9.6.7. Pro: The US federal government was not the culpable government for slavery and is therefore the wrong entity to pay reparations. Why should the US taxpayer foot the bill as opposed to slave holding states, Britain, and/or African countries that allowed the slave trade to happen?
1.9.6.8. Pro: The US inherited the practice of slavery from the Europeans. If a duty to pay reparation exists, then it should fall on them.
1.9.6.8.1. Con: -> See 1.9.6.1.
1.9.6.8.2. Pro: Those who experienced independence first, like [Thomas Jefferson](https://www.monticello.org/slavery-at-monticello/liberty-slavery/society-dependent-slavery), witnessed a society completely dependent on slaves. This illustrates how the US inherited slavery.
1.9.6.8.3. Con: Those who had plantations did not [inherit](https://www.monticello.org/slavery-at-monticello/african-slavery-british-north-america/inheriting-slavery-world-peter-jane-and) them from a European master but from their fathers, just like Thomas Jefferson.
1.9.6.8.3.1. Con: Thomas Jefferson's father, [Peter Jefferson, was of European descent](https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/jeffersons-ancestry). He inherited the tradition of slavery from his father, who inherited it from his father's father, and at some point along that way back someone inherited it from a person who was born in Europe and literally European.
1.9.6.8.4. Con: The North abolished slavery at an earlier date than the South. This shows that there was considerable leeway for the US to deal with the practice.
1.9.6.8.4.1. Con: The North was able to abolish slavery earlier because of fundamental differences in its economy.
1.9.6.8.4.1.1. Pro: The North had fewer large plantations, many factories staffed with immigrants from Europe and a higher rate of urbanization than the South. Slavery [thus died out](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/north-and-south), whereas it thrived in the South with its large plantations, little industry and absence of major cities except for New Orleans.
1.9.6.8.4.2. Con: The North still maintained a system of slavery in all but name.
1.9.6.8.5. Con: Europeans did not force the US to practice slavery, thus they cannot be held completely responsible.
1.9.6.8.5.1. Con: -> See 1.9.6.3.2.1.1.
1.9.6.8.6. Con: While it may be that European nations also owe reparations, this does not mean that the U.S. does not.
1.9.6.9. Pro: In most, if not all, countries, some segments of society used to be slaves to some privileged group.
1.9.6.9.1. Con: The US had a uniquely extensive system of slavery.
1.9.6.9.1.1. Pro: Slavery in the US was different from many of its contemporary equivalents as it was [more racialized](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_history_of_american_slavery/2015/05/why_america_adopted_race_based_slavery.html) - which made it inescapable for people of the 'wrong' skin color.
1.9.6.9.1.1.1. Pro: Instances of white slavery were extremely rare anomalies and theories that white ethnic groups have been enslaved are clearly wrong, such as is the case with the [Irish](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/us/irish-slaves-myth.html?_r=0).
1.9.6.9.1.1.2. Pro: Free Black Americans were at constant risk of [being kidnapped into slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Underground_Railroad), frequently with the outright cooperation of authorities.
1.9.6.9.1.1.3. Con: Slavery in other parts of the Americas was equally racialized. In fact, the slaves that ended up in North America came from the same source and supplier as those in the South.
1.9.6.9.1.1.3.1. Con: The systems of racial classification \(such as the Spanish [casta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casta) system, or [Brazilian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_Brazil#Immigration_discussion_and_policy_in_the_19th_century) and [Caribbean](http://www.trinidadandtobagonews.com/forum/webbbs_config.pl?md=read;id=1467) theories of race\) set up in other parts of the Americas were quite different than in the United States.
1.9.6.9.1.1.4. Pro: In [Spanish and Portuguese America](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/origins-slavery/resources/american-slavery-comparative-perspective), different racial gradations were recognized and racial mixing was allowed to some extent, neither of which happened in the US.
1.9.6.9.1.2. Con: The total number of slaves in British colonies in the Caribbean and North America was nearly the same in 1750 \([Ruggles, p.16](http://users.hist.umn.edu/~ruggles/hist3797/slavery.pdf)\).
1.9.6.9.1.3. Con: The [Arab Slave Trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_slave_trade) with its 10-17 million traded slaves was equally extensive as the [Atlantic Slave Trade](http://www.understandingslavery.com/index.php-option=com_content&view=article&id=369&Itemid=145.html).
1.9.6.9.1.3.1. Con: These estimates refer to the [time span](http://necrometrics.com/pre1700b.htm#ISlave) from the 7th to the 19th century, and therefore a period of 1200 years. That is four to five times the duration of slavery in North America.
1.9.6.9.1.3.1.1. Pro: Comparing the maximum casualty numbers in both cases and calculating them per year, the Arab Slave Trade was considerably less lethal - with 14,000 slaves per year - than the Atlantic Slave Trade - with 43,000 slaves per year.
1.9.6.9.1.3.2. Pro: Adjusted for mid-20th century equivalent death toll, the Arab Slave Trade ranks as the 3rd most lethal thing humans have ever done to each other, compared to the Atlantic Slave Trade, which ranks 8th \([Pinker, p. 195](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature)\).
1.9.6.9.1.4. Pro: The desire for free/cheap labour in the burgeoning colonies/states of what is now America heavily incentivised the slave trade in Africa. This was done through warmongering by European powers with firearms and other goods.
1.9.6.9.2. Con: The fact that some other person or country has also committed a crime in no way exonerates new commissions of said crime. If this were not true then no one could ever be convicted of murder again because they were not the first to murder.
1.9.6.9.3. Con: There were times and places where slavery was broadly accepted. But by the time that slavery was commonplace in the US, there were big parts of society in the North that rejected the idea of slavery strongly. So the idea to abolish slavery is not a new one but one that was very common in some circles at that time.
1.9.6.9.4. Pro: [Slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Rome#Emancipation) played an important role in ancient Roman society.
1.9.6.9.4.1. Con: It is questionable whether practices from two millennia ago in ancient Rome are the appropriate comparison for the slavery that lasted in America until the 19th century.
1.9.6.9.4.2. Con: Rome did not have race-based chattel slavery. Until the transatlantic slave trade that was happening in conjunction with the settlement of the American continents, race-based chattel slavery of that scale was unheard of.
1.9.6.9.5. Pro: In [Mauritania](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6938032.stm) slavery was not punished before 2007 and not outlawed before 1981.
1.9.6.9.6. Pro: There are up to 50 million [contemporary slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_slavery) as of today.
1.9.6.10. Con: However, the US perpetuated the system [long after](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-slavery-idUSL1561464920070322) most other nations had ended the practice.
1.9.6.10.1. Pro: In fact, the [slave population](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/slavery-and-anti-slavery/resources/facts-about-slave-trade-and-slavery) in the US skyrocketed in the 19th century, while other powers abolished slavery.
1.9.6.10.2. Con: The system became much more concentrated in the 19th century, with the [percentage](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/slavery-and-anti-slavery/resources/facts-about-slave-trade-and-slavery) of slave-holding households decreasing from 36% to 25% between 1836 and 1860.
1.9.6.11. Pro: -> See 1.9.6.3.2.1.1.
1.9.7. Con: Preventing [modern day slavery](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Contemporary_slavery) is more adequate redress than reparations for the moral wrong slavery was.
1.9.7.1. Con: Reparations can be made in tandem with other responses.
1.9.7.1.1. Con: Given what gargantuan task the abolishment of [modern slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_slavery) is, it is better to focus all available resources on the fight against it.
1.9.7.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.
1.9.7.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.
1.9.7.3. Pro: Preventing modern day slavery has spillover effects because it is mainly conducted by organized crime. Drug trafficking, for example, would reduce when mafia structures are weakened in the process of fighting slavery.
1.9.7.4. Con: Reparations rely on the principal of compensation for committing a moral wrong. The United States does not have any moral obligation to help states combat modern-day slavery, but it does have a debt to pay for slavery.
1.9.8. Con: If reparations came in the form of money, we're in effect retroactively turning the then slaves into employed wage earners. Slavery was/is an atrocity. To suggest it can be made up for with a one time check is incredibly superficial.
1.9.8.1. Con: Money is the way civil courts redeem injustice. The above claim would make most of the judicial system superficial. Its application in this case is no less superficial than in any of the myriad other instances where we use money to right a past wrong.
1.9.8.2. Pro: This framework is troubling in that it implies that practically any atrocity can always be retroactively justified with proper accounting by future generations.
1.9.8.2.1. Con: We need not understand reparations as retroactively justifying slavery. Rather, it would make more sense to view them as partially remediating some of its negative effects.
1.9.9. Pro: Being required to repay what was stolen is a universal tenet of human justice, law and morality.
1.9.9.1. Con: Some crimes are irreparable. These include murder, for which a death penalty was instituted. If we are retroactively restoring legal human status to slaves and wish to redress the previous egregious miscategorization, repayment should be in a currency that does not pretend human lives are quantifiable in dollars.
1.9.9.1.1. Con: Monetary payments are the best means of paying reparations; a better alternative that is fair and operationable is not available.
1.9.9.2. Pro: Through slavery, Jim Crow, redlining, and other institutional discrimination, trillions of dollars of wealth have been stolen from or denied to African Americans. The theft of this wealth goes a long way to explaining the discrepancies in outcomes that now exist in our country.
1.9.10. Con: The dustbin of history has no end of moral wrongs to everyone's ancestors. To claim them as relevant to modern times is to claim injustice till the end of time.
1.9.10.1. Con: That there may be other moral wrongs that require redress does not mean disqualify any particular claim. Each must be evaluated on its own merits.
1.9.10.2. Con: The moral wrong of slavery in the forms of financial and cultural disenfranchisement are still relevant to the living ancestors of slaves today, particularly when anti-black discrimination which proceeded slavery is considered.
1.9.10.3. Con: The relevancy of the American government to Americans, whose lineage is of slaves, is too great to claim that there is not enough connection to morally justify reparations.
1.9.11. Pro: Publicly facing and taking responsibility for our national crimes might allow America to finally embrace its founding documents with sincerity, and without any form of moral obligation on its consciousness.
1.9.12. Con: Even if there is a moral obligation to the descendants of slaves, there is not a moral obligation for reparations.
1.9.12.1. Pro: A moral obligation does not necessarily point towards reparations; a Truth and Reconciliation process would make more sense.
1.9.12.1.1. Con: There are many contemporary organizations that existed at that time and participated in slavery, from governing bodies to corporations to civic organizations. In these cases, there is a moral obligation for reparations specifically, irrespective of whether a Truth and Reconciliation process is also used.
1.9.12.1.2. Con: Truth and Reconciliation Commission are meant to unveil crimes in the past and reconcile perpetrators with victims. The crime of slavery is already well-known and well-researched; and neither perpetrators nor victims are alive anymore. This approach is therefore wholly inappropriate in this context.
1.9.12.2. Pro: There is a moral obligations to help make things right, but capital is unlikely to do so. There are other ways to make things right that are better than capital.
1.9.12.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.15.15.4.
1.9.12.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.15.15.
1.9.13. Con: It is arbitrary to designate the American government as the provider and Black Americans as the recipients of reparations. As there are plenty of other perpetrators and victims of past injustices, there are plenty of other entities that could be designated as providers and recipients of reparations with just as much justification.
1.9.14. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.3.2.2.
1.10. Pro: Existing legal frameworks point in the direction of paying reparations.
1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.
1.10.2. Pro: In the [18th century](https://daily.jstor.org/how-an-ex-slave-successfully-won-case-reparations-1783/?utm_source=internalhouse&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=jstordaily_02162017&cid=eml_j_jstordaily_dailylist_02162017) former slaves have successfully sued for compensation. This illustrates there is some legal precedent to hold companies accountable by former slaves
1.10.2.1. Con: Former slaves suing their captors, yes. This is not modern Black Americans suing non-captors. It is apples and oranges and irrelevant.
1.10.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.
1.10.3. Con: An action does not become morally good just because it follows the law. Many laws are morally wrong - and the legal foundations of slavery are a case in point.
1.10.3.1. Con: Pointing to the immorality of some laws does not disqualify the original thesis. Just because laws can be immoral, it does not follow that the reparations law is immoral. In this case, the legal precedents line up with what is moral anyway.
1.10.4. Con: Existing legal framework allows reparations/restitution for those that [were wronged](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/restitution) by the wrongdoer. Proving a monetary damage to someone several generations down the line of the individual that was wronged would be immensely difficult, even in civil litigation.
1.10.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.
1.10.5. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.
1.10.6. Pro: "Based on the legal principles set forth in the International Criminal Tribunals, the Rome Statute, and the Slavery Conventions, the international community may acknowledge the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade as a crime against humanity. Reparations are therefore mandated." \([Muhammed, p. 945](http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1173&context=auilr)\)
1.10.6.1. Con: The U.S. didn't sign the Rome statute, and the Rome statute also can't be used to prosecute states or organizations.
1.10.6.2. Con: Even if slavery is classified as a crime against humanity this does not automatically entitle people who were not directly affected by it to compensation payments.
1.10.6.3. Con: The text explicitly states that "the Rome Statute of 1998 apparently would not apply to the Trans-Atlantic slave trade" \([Muhammed, p. 943](http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1173&context=auilr)\) as it cannot be applied retroactively. Furthermore, it applies only to individuals rather than countries as a whole. None of the individuals responsible for the slave trade are alive anymore.
1.10.6.4. Con: The author makes claims exclusively about legal accountability, not about reparations.
1.10.7. Con: Prior to the [13th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) to the US Constitution \(ratified in 1865\), slavery was [not illegal](https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/amistad/slavery.html) in the US. Thus, there is no legal foundation for compensating the descendants of slaves for the crime against their ancestors when, in strictly legal terms, no crime was committed.
1.10.7.1. Con: The whole premise of reparations is that slavery was legal, and therefore endorsed by the government. Its legality is why the government has a responsibility to pay reparations.
1.10.7.2. Con: The notion of national responsibility for the acts of the past is e.g. displayed in the reparations for the Holocaust \(which was, in strictly legal terms, also legal back then\). Germany has paid billions not only to individual [survivors](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/germany-to-pay-772-million-euros-in-reparations-to-holocaust-survivors-a-902528.html), but also to the [State of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reparations_Agreement_between_Israel_and_West_Germany).
1.10.7.2.1. Con: Paying reparations to survivors of the Holocaust can be compared to paying reparations to survivors of slavery \(former slaves\), but not to their descendants.
1.10.7.2.2. Pro: Liberia as a Slave exodus state could receive subsidies that would help the infrastructure of an impoverished nation.
1.10.7.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.9.3.4.1.
1.10.7.3. Con: Japanese internment camps were [legal](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Korematsu_v._United_States) at the time, yet the United States still compensated Japanese Americans that were affected by their actions.
1.10.7.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.3.2.1.
1.10.7.3.2. Con: Internment camps were explicitly a result of the US government's action, whereas chattel slavery was an economic and cultural practice that both pre-dated the existence of the US government and survived long after the period of legal slavery in the US.
1.10.7.3.2.1. Con: The question isn't whether the US should pay reparation for all instances of chattel slavery \(any more than reparations for the internment of Japanese Americans were taken to be reparations for all internment camps as such\). The question is whether the US should pay for the instances of enslavement that occurred during its existence and within its borders.
1.10.7.4. Con: This policy does not require ex post facto criminalisation of conduct from the time, merely an acknowledgement of sufficient moral wrong to give foundations to - voluntarily offered - compensation.
1.10.7.4.1. Pro: Compensation may be offered to alleviate feelings of guilt, which could apply here.
1.10.7.4.2. Pro: A moral duty to act does not require a legal foundation, but stems rather from a sense of ethical obligation. This could stem from unfairly accrued benefits, or a sense that unjust harm was caused and merits some form of remedy.
1.10.7.4.3. Con: Stating that the U.S. Government can voluntarily offer compensation only begs the question of if it should, and thus does not support the original statement.
1.10.7.4.4. Con: Reparations could not be voluntary, but would be forced on the populace via taxes.
1.10.7.5. Pro: If those legal frameworks did not exist before slavery was abolished, then the argument is absurd because then citizens could be punished for following current laws due to the creation of new laws they have no control over. Precisely, if a US citizen is found to have been forced into slavery in this modern day and age, only then does any law claiming reparations go into effect.
1.10.7.6. Con: Repaying for the committed suffering is morally good with or without a law. Just because slavery had legal foundations does not make the suffering they brought lawful too. These crimes were known to be committed for a fact. They are documented.
1.11. Con: There are severe barriers to specifying who should be entitled to reparations, and what form reparations would take.
1.11.1. Con: These problems are of a procedural nature, whereas the question in focus here is one of principle.
1.11.1.1. Pro: Procedural solutions are already envisioned, for example, by the [Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/40/text).
1.11.1.1.1. Con: The bill has been introduced to every Congress [since 1989](http://ibw21.org/commentary/my-reparations-bill-hr-40/) and has never become a law. This shows how little support there is for even enacting a commission to merely study the issue of reparations for Black Americans.
1.11.1.1.2. Con: Creating a commission to look into it is not to say that there are feasible solutions. You could make a Congressional commission to study feasibility of human teleportation, but that doesn't mean there's an actual way to do that.
1.11.1.2. Con: How feasible it is to determine who is owed reparations is incredibly relevant to whether the policy should be enacted. It makes little sense to pay reparations if we cannot effectively determine to whom to pay them.
1.11.1.3. Con: It is impossible to make valid statements on whether it is a good principle or not without understanding the implications of acting on a principle. If those implications are difficult or impossible to define, then there's a good sign the principle itself is flawed.
1.11.1.4. Con: The principle here is one of justice. Distributing justice requires defining exactly who was wronged and exactly who was the perpetrator. You can't consider the principle in a particular case without these pieces.
1.11.1.5. Con: The acknowledgment of debt without the intent to give reparations is pointless, and would not satiate those demanding the reparations.
1.11.1.6. Con: The thesis is explicitly a statement of action, not a statement of principle. The unfeasibility of an action is a valid argument against such a thesis.
1.11.1.7. Pro: The recipients, amount and payout method of reparations can be determined after a decision has been made about whether there should be reparations in the first place.
1.11.1.7.1. Con: Whether or not reparations should be paid would depend largely on who would be paying and who would be receiving.
1.11.1.8. Con: Depending on these procedural issues, the public support of and the feasibility of an agreement would change. These procedural issues are therefore intrinsically linked to the larger question about reparations in general.
1.11.1.8.1. Con: It is wrong to assert that public opinion should have precedence over logical reasoning is. These reparations must have a legal foundation or they would introduce uncertainty as to who is entitled to make a claim upon the US government.
1.11.1.9. Pro: There are plenty of ways to figure out procedural problems, from referenda to expert commissions.
1.11.2. Pro: With the way our government operates there would be too many hoops to jump through for people to claim their reparations.
1.11.3. Pro: Some slaves were held not by the US, but by Indian tribes \(e.g. the Choctaw\). The US government does not owe anything to their descendants.
1.11.3.1. Con: Choctaw Indians are now citizens of the United States, thus their legacy is part of the United States' legacy.
1.11.3.2. Con: The Choctaw [Dawes](http://www.african-nativeamerican.com/8-chocfreed.htm) roll of Freedman lists around 6,000 freedmen. Compared to the nearly 4 million enslaved individuals at the start of the [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_United_States_Census), this is an insignificant fraction.
1.11.4. Pro: If we do indeed owe reparations, we almost certainly owe *fair* reparations. Thus, we should not pay reparations if we cannot figure out a reasonable method of determining who deserves them.
1.11.5. Pro: An African American family might adopt a white child, thus exposing him/her to the inherited inequity caused by slavery. If reparations are to be made fairly then factors like that should be taken into account.
1.11.6. Pro: Northern farmers were also harmed by slavery, so reparations may be due to their descendants.
1.11.7. Pro: Any attempt at implementing reparations would run into the problem that many Black Americans are not easily reachable with financial transactions as many of them [are unbanked](http://madamenoire.com/214586/more-than-20-percent-of-black-families-dont-have-bank-accounts/).
1.11.8. Pro: If reparations are meant to compensate those who suffered from slavery, they should also be given to the descendants of the Union soldiers who were harmed or killed in the fight against slavery.
1.11.8.1. Con: A Soldier should be given benefits for fighting to defend freedom. However, there is a fundamental difference between a miscarriage of justice or denial of rights and the sacrifice of a soldier. Black families had their wealth taken, names and children stolen, and government-sanctioned violence done to them. There is no slippery slope and no comparison.
1.11.8.2. Con: These are two different groups and circumstances entirely. Another example would be the soldiers of WWII and Holocaust survivors. One is rescuer, one is survivor, both were impacted by their interactions with the Nazis, but there is clear delineation.
1.11.8.3. Con: Union soldiers and their dependents received benefits due to their service and veteran status at that time. Slaves were never compensated for anything.
1.11.9. Con: A precedent for determining reparations entitlement has already been set by introducing [blood quantum laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_quantum_laws) to determine native tribal membership. Since African-Americans are not split into tribes, it would be a much less complex ordeal to apply similar laws when distributing reparations to this group.
1.11.9.1. Con: Native American's had their entire nation taken, and genocide committed upon them, it is not the same.
1.11.9.1.1. Con: The African Diaspora has often been analyzed as a form of [genocide](https://utexas.influuent.utsystem.edu/en/publications/genocide-in-the-african-diaspora-united-states-brazil-and-the-nee). On such an analysis, the analogy holds.
1.11.9.1.2. Con: This is merely a matter of degree. The two historical tragedies are wholly comparable.
1.11.10. Con: With advanced computers and genealogy, plus a long, written legal record and censuses, we are technologically capable of identifying would-be recipients of reparations for US slavery.
1.11.10.1. Con: Tests for genetic heredity are only accurate for living ancestors -- paternity tests work because you have the DNA of both parent and child, and can compare genetic material. Finding, cataloging, and analyzing the DNA of every slave and tracking their offspring over time would become exponentially more difficult the more people are involved. Racial mixing, immigration and emigration, DNA contaminants and degradation would make this process nearly impossible, if not prohibitively expensive.
1.11.10.2. Pro: Universities worldwide have been building a [database](http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2018/msu-uses-15m-mellon-foundation-grant-to-build-massive-slave-trade-database/) that would facilitate the goal of identifying those who are descended from slaves.
1.11.11. Con: It is not difficult to specify what forms reparations could take. A tax increase crafted to minimize the effect on the economy and vulnerable populations could raise the money and then discharging it in the form of a negative income tax to the target recipients.
1.11.12. Pro: Many Americans who identify and present as white will have at least a small percentage of black/African ancestry. It wouldn't make sense for them to be entitled to reparations as well, since they do not suffer the same cultural disadvantages that black Americans do as a result of slavery.
1.11.12.1. Con: The proposal is for descendants of slavery, not of black/African ancestry. One would assume that link would need to be proven first. \(Some African-americans would not qualify, such as Barack Obama, as his ancestors were not US slaves\). But determining who is entitled, what makes sense and how much one has suffered as a result of slavery is subjective \(and separate from the larger issue of should the US pay reparations at all\).
1.11.13. Con: A free college scholarship to any decendent of a slave to any state college or trade school would be a small cost and provide a huge benefit. Other trials for reparations could be added until parity is achieved.
1.11.14. Pro: Many of the citizens who would pay for this are descendants of Americans who immigrated after slavery was abolished. Forcing them to pay reparations would be unjust.
1.11.14.1. Pro: Making immigrants pay for crimes committed in American history and which they had nothing to do with has the potential to stir their resentment towards the recipients of reparations.
1.11.15. Pro: The burden of proof of eligibility for compensation would need to be with the recipient. Many of the most marginalized potential recipients may not have means or education to probe their own ancestry thereby negating the benefit for the most marginalized groups.
1.11.16. Pro: No, because taxes gathered from other ethnic groups that have only been here for a short time were not part of enslavement, and should not have to bear the burden of reparations towards African Americans.
1.11.17. Pro: There are severe barriers to determining an appropriate amount of recompense.
1.11.17.1. Pro: It is difficult to assess a starting point and an end to slavery. This makes reparations difficult to quantify.
1.11.17.1.1. Con: -> See 1.11.1.
1.11.17.1.2. Con: Although it is difficult to mark a starting point for the practice of slavery in the Americas, the ratification of the Constitution marks a natural starting point for US reparations calculations: June 21,1788.
1.11.17.1.2.1. Pro: At this point, the US became solely responsible for the laws within its borders, and hence for the practice of slavery in the US.
1.11.17.1.3. Con: The United States legally ended the practice of slavery on December 6, 1865 with the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. Although it had already ended in parts of the United States prior to this, this marks a natural ending.
1.11.17.2. Pro: Depending on the state, slavery was abolished at different times. This makes the duration calculation difficult and not uniform.
1.11.17.2.1. Con: Being a part of a country is an acceptance of collective responsibility for the financial obligations of that nation. In the same way, the fact that some states are poorer than others does not factor into the distribution of funding for education, for example.
1.11.17.2.2. Con: -> See 1.11.10.
1.11.17.2.3. Con: This could simply be taken into account in assessing how much each state should contribute towards reparations.
1.11.17.2.4. Con: While it is true that in northern states \(where slavery was not widespread\), slavery was abolished at different times, for all intents and purposes, the passage of the 13th Amendment marked the end of slavery in the United States.
1.11.18. Pro: It is unclear who would be entitled to reparations. Black Americans as a whole are not.
1.11.18.1. Con: [About half](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/on-african-american-migrations/) of all slaves brought directly to North America came from today's Angola, Senegal and Gambia. None of these countries features prominently on the [list of countries](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/02/african-immigrant-population-in-u-s-steadily-climbs/) from which Africans migrate to America today. Those who migrate to the United States today therefore are unlikely to come from places hit hard by the effects of the slave trade.
1.11.18.2. Pro: Many current US citizens are likely to have both slave owner and slave ancestors. This makes it unclear who is the descendant of victims and perpetrators.
1.11.18.2.1. Con: For many people, the slave owner in their family tree had a child with their slave. Given the often non-consensual nature of these interactions, it seems harmful to use this as a disqualifying factor.
1.11.18.2.1.1. Con: It is possible to have both ancestors who were slaves and those who were slave owners because of relationships that took place well after the end of the practice of slavery.
1.11.18.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Interracial marriage](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/12/interracial-marriage-who-is-marrying-out/) is one way by which current US citizens can be descendants of both victims and perpetrators.
1.11.18.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Interracial marriage has only been [legal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-miscegenation_laws_in_the_United_States) in all of the US since 1967. During slavery and Jim Crow, Black women frequently were subject to gendered [violence](http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CAT/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CAT_CSS_USA_18555_E.pdf), including rape \(p. 3\).
1.11.18.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Only a small number of present-day American citizens were born in a place in time where interracial marriages were illegal.
1.11.18.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: More than two-thirds of the current US population [has been born since 1967](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=u.s.+population+under+age+50) \(as of 2017\).
1.11.18.2.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: 20 States and the District of Columbia have never [banned interracial marriages](http://12 had such laws but repealed them in the 1800's, and 14 more States had repealed their laws before the Loving ruling in 1967.), 12 had such laws but repealed them in the 1800's, and 14 more States had repealed their laws before the Loving ruling in 1967.
1.11.18.2.1.2. Pro: Furthermore, some people who employed African American servants or slaves bequeathed property to them--another complicating factor that should not disqualify one from the pool of would-be recipients \(of reparations for slavery\).
1.11.18.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.18.2.1.1.1.
1.11.18.2.3. Pro: Consensual interracial relationships could have produced children after slavery was abolished.
1.11.18.2.4. Con: This claim implies that the privileges and costs of slavery are borne equally by all descendants. In fact, assignation to a particular racial category \(and thus being harmed by institutional racism or benefiting from white privilege\) isn't as simple as tracing out one's ancestors.
1.11.18.2.4.1. Con: Actually, in the case of determining whether the US government should pay reparations, proving one was an ancestor of slaves should be an essential criterion. Otherwise, people could simply lie.

For example, there may be cases of dark-skinned individuals of non-African descent claiming reparations for slavery by falsely claiming they are of African descent.
1.11.18.2.5. Con: Having mixed ancestry does not change one's descent. Mixed children of that era did not receive benefits that white children of slave owners received, and being mixed race has historically been just as much of a barrier to certain rights and privileges under the law.
1.11.18.3. Con: There are [proposals](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Darity/publication/4791140_Forty_Acres_and_a_Mule_in_the_21st_Century/links/543eb2a80cf2eaec07e7ee0c.pdf) that would determine which Black Americans would be entitled and which would not. For example, using census self-identification as Black at least 10 years prior to reparations as a rubric is workable.
1.11.18.4. Pro: Establishing ancestral links to slavery is difficult, as little data is available on Black Americans [for the time before 1870](http://www.ocregister.com/articles/african-705720-records-people.html) when former slaves were first included in the national census \(oftentimes without clear family relationships\).
1.11.18.4.1. Con: So long as someone can trace their ancestry back to this point, going further is largely irrelevant - an adult appearing on the census for the first time in 1870 with no related immigration pathway is presumably a freed slave, and the cases where this is incorrect are unlikely to be common enough to cause significant problems.
1.11.18.4.2. Pro: Some Black Americans may lack documentation proving their ancestors were enslaved or may not have enslaved ancestors at all.
1.11.18.5. Pro: There were [Black owners of slaves](http://www.theroot.com/did-black-people-own-slaves-1790895436) whose descendants, consequently, do not deserve reparations.
1.11.18.5.1. Con: The majority of these Black slave owners owned only one or multiple family members in order [to protect them](http://www.theroot.com/did-black-people-own-slaves-1790895436). This was therefore slave ownership out of benevolence.
1.11.18.5.2. Con: These were a sufficiently rare occurrence as to not be worth worrying about.
1.11.18.5.3. Con: These people still suffered as slaves prior to being freed, and their descendants are likely to have other enslaved ancestors who deserved compensation.
1.11.18.5.4. Con: Whether a slave owner was Black or white does not matter. America allowed slavery to take place in each and every of these cases.
1.11.18.6. Pro: There is a danger of moral hazard because more people will claim their African ancestry in order to profit from reparations. That is, it might incentivize those who have self-identified as white and benefited from 'white privilege' to now claim reparations for a harm that has not impacted them. \([Darity & Frank, p. 336](http://cas2.umkc.edu/ECON/economics/faculty/Forstater/688/Reading/Black%20Political%20Economy/EconomicsReparations.pdf)\).
1.11.18.6.1. Con: If they are able to establish genuine heritage, it is unclear what the problem with this would be.
1.11.18.7. Con: -> See 1.11.1.
1.11.18.8. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.2.
1.11.18.9. Pro: It is unclear whether self-identified Black Americans, who might not have any ancestors who identified or were regarded as Black, would qualify for reparations.
1.11.18.10. Pro: The identification of actual descendants of slaves would be an enormous undertaking, because such descent is not simply identical with present racial self-identification. Fair distribution would be impossible.
1.11.18.10.1. Con: Fair methods can be worked out once society acknowledges its obligation to provide reparations in the first place.
1.11.18.10.1.1. Con: It is unlikely that this consensus can be established without answering these questions about fairness first. It is, for example, entirely open whether all Black Americans or only the descendants of slaves should receive reparations.
1.11.18.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.18.2.
1.11.18.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.17.2.
1.11.18.10.4. Con: Compensating some that 'would not deserve it' still outweighs not compensating the vast majority of black americans who do.
1.11.18.10.5. Con: -> See 1.11.10.
1.11.18.11. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.
1.11.18.12. Pro: Not all Black Americans suffer the consequences of slavery.
1.11.18.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.11.18.12.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.5.3.1.
1.11.18.12.3. Pro: According to opinion polls, half of all Black Americans believe relations between white and Black people are [very or somewhat good](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1687/race-relations.aspx) and that the United States either [has made or will make](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/on-views-of-race-and-inequality-blacks-and-whites-are-worlds-apart/) the changes necessary for racial equality.
1.11.18.12.3.1. Con: The same poll says that 88% of Black Americans believe that America still has to do more to achieve racial equality.
1.12. Pro: The US has already paid reparations for other past grievances.
1.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.4.
1.12.2. Con: A precedent of reparations in some cases does not necessarily establish that they are appropriate for slavery.
1.12.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.4.2.
1.12.3. Con: Past reparations programs that the US has paid are not comparable to this proposal because the scale is greatly different. Reparations were paid to much smaller groups in the past compared to the scale of the African American demographic. Reparations for the internment of Japanese-Americans were paid out to about [82.000 individuals](http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Civil_Liberties_Act_of_1988/#Results), compensations to Alaskan natives went to about [80.000 individuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Native_Claims_Settlement_Act).
1.12.4. Pro: Paying for one wrongdoing but not for slavery tacitly claims that slavery was not as bad.
1.12.4.1. Con: Reparation outcomes depend to a large extent on lobbying, not whether or not one atrocity was worse than another. The reparations to victims of [undue leprosy treatment](http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/780508.html) in Korea and Japan, for example, were agreed to and paid for because of the strength of the legal and lobbying effort.
1.12.4.1.1. Con: In the US, lobbying represents the fiscal value / interest a given topic has. Even as a form of lobbying, by not paying reparations the US is showing how little it cares about slavery in comparison with other interests.
1.12.4.2. Con: Different moral wrongs often have different appropriate responses. Just because reparations were appropriate in another situation does not mean they will be appropriate here; nor does not-implementing reparations imply that slavery was moral.
1.12.4.3. Con: Not paying reparations does not imply implicit moral approval. The decision to make reparations is not based simply on how bad the atrocity is, but also on a judgement on how effective a remedy reparations would be.
1.12.5. Con: -> See 1.8.13.
1.12.6. Pro: Even some slave owners, such as in the [District of Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_Compensated_Emancipation_Act), received compensation. The slaves themselves, however, did not receive anything.
1.12.6.1. Con: This case makes for a flawed comparison as these slave owners received compensation for economic losses they incurred - whereas Black Americans would receive reparations for the enslavement of their ancestors and its persistent consequences.
1.12.6.1.1. Pro: [Compensated emancipation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensated_emancipation) was part of the toolbox of US approaches to put an end to slavery. It was used to prevent opposition and speed up the process, and so should be considered as the state doing its best to end slavery, rather than rewarding slave owners.
1.12.6.1.2. Con: Slaves' labour was stolen and reparations would be, at least in part, a compensation for this economic loss.
1.12.6.2. Con: -> See 1.12.6.1.1.
1.13. Con: -> See 1.9.3.
