Discussion Title: Should homeschooling be banned?

1. Homeschooling should be banned.
1.1. Pro: Homeschooling deprives children and families from interacting with people with different religions, ideologies or values.
1.1.1. Con: Homeschool students can interact regularly with other children from a greater diversity of physical locations, allowing them more exposure outside of their socio-economic group.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Homeschooling usually involves children interacting with far more varied age groups on a regular basis.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Since children who attend regular schools can interact with their peers at schools and with other children in leisure and sport facilities, through extra-curricular activities and family or during holidays, it is unclear why homeschooled kids necessarily interact with more varied age groups.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The entire structure of most schools is based on age segregation. Homeschools are rarely segregated in this manner and are instead based on ability levels and interests, as well as family structure.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Children who attend public school still socialise with their siblings and so still socialise with the specific age brackets in their family structure.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Homeschooled children tend to be involved in a [greater number](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1311) of extracurricular activities, and so have other opportunities to socialise with children their own age.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: This means that homeschooled children only get to interact with children with similar interests. Therefore, they aren't exposed to a diversity of interests and viewpoints.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: To compensate for the lack of socialization in the school environment, parents may opt to sign up their children in extracurricular activities, yet that may not be always the case.
1.1.1.2.3. Con: For low-income parents or families who live in remote areas, regular schools provide a minimum of socialization for children that homeschooling does not offer.
1.1.2. Con: Many traditional schools lack significant diversity in their student body.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Parents often select schools for their children on the basis of common values, cultures and achievements.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Parents will often go to extreme measures in order to place their children in what they view as the "best school". Depending on the parent's priorities this can often be based on the school's values, culture and achievements.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Some parents move closer to the school they want in order to fall into its [geographic/catchment](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/oct/25/chicken-run-city-schools) area.
1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: In Ireland due to the [baptism barrier](https://maternityandinfant.ie/2017/01/4-things-need-know-baptism-barrier/) many parents who were not Catholic baptised their children in order for them to get into what they viewed as superior schools.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Some private and charter schools require certain [religious affiliations](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/02/does-religion-have-a-place-in-public-schools/516189/), offering similar degrees of religious isolation as homeschooling.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: These institutions are justified on secular grounds because they offer [thematic language and cultural instruction](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/02/does-religion-have-a-place-in-public-schools/516189/).
1.1.2.2.2. Con: Some schools with religious teachers or mission statements do not exclude students from other faiths from enrolling, thereby avoiding isolationism.
1.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: In Britain, schools with religious charters are required to reserve [at least 50%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_50%25_Rule_\(English_Faith_School_Admissions\)) of their enrollment spots as "open admission," that are allocated without reference to the faith of the student applicants.
1.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: The British Department of Government [recommended](https://consult.education.gov.uk/school-frameworks/schools-that-work-for-everyone/) replacing this rule due to its failure to improve diversity.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Traditional schooling deprives children and families from interacting with people of different religions, ideologies, values and socioeconomic backgrounds.
1.1.3. Pro: Parents are able to control all of their children's social interactions, ensuring they do not meet people with whose values they disagree.
1.1.3.1. Con: Parents are able to create a social environment in which their children interact with people with whom they disagree.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Homeschooling parents can raise their children in an environment with different opinions only if they choose to do so, whereas in regular schools, chances are children encounter people with different opinions.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Religious families that homeschool may foster fundamentalist religious values which are strengthened by isolation. These are bad for the social cohesion of society.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: One should not equate religious behaviors or motivations with homeschooling as the homeschooling community is quite diverse.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Homeschooling may not always be chosen for religious reasons, yet in the US, where it is more [prevalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling_international_status_and_statistics), many families do choose homeschooling for religious reasons.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: [64%](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oii/nonpublic/statistics.html) of parents who homeschool in the US quote religion as important \(among other factors\) to do so.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Parents who homeschool in the US quote other [reasons](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oii/nonpublic/statistics.html) as important before religion: “a concern about the environment of other schools” \(91%\), “to provide a moral instruction” \(77%\) and “a dissatisfaction with the academic instruction at other schools” \(74%\).
1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Voluntary surveys may not adequately represent how important religious beliefs are. Among the reasons quoted by parents \(such as concerns about the school environment or moral instruction\) religion can still be a motivating factor behind them.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Only [17%](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2016/2016096rev.pdf) of parents who homeschool in the US quote religion as the most important factor.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1.3. Con: In Australia, according to data, only [5%](http://whyonearthhomeschool.com/aussiestatsaustralianhomeschooling.html) of parents homeschool for religious reasons.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: [Christians](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/homeschooling-without-god/475953/) make up [75%](http://whyonearthhomeschool.com/homeschoolingfactsandstatistics-454434.html) of homeschoolers in the US. In the general population Christians make up 71% of all Americans.
1.1.3.2.1.1.2. Con: Private schools map to the [same patterns](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oii/nonpublic/statistics.html) as homeschooling in terms of religious orientation.
1.1.3.2.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.2.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.
1.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Qualitative research highlights how Christian fathers view homeschooling as a system of [“total socialization”](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0160597613495841), aimed at rejecting the influence of other socialization agents which goal is above all “[moral conversion](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1033)” besides academic success.
1.1.3.2.3. Con: The religious convictions of various groups are of more importance than an abstract “social cohesion”.
1.1.3.2.4. Pro: In a 2014 survey of 3,700 adult homeschool alumni, [58% of respondents](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1469) agreed that their family had been fundamentalist \(according to George Marsden's [definition](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195300475/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0195300475&linkCode=as2&tag=homesreseanot-20&linkId=4HVY5DNDJPZ26JZ6)\).
1.1.4. Pro: The school system promotes curriculum and programs that help prevent racism and discrimination \(including [anti-Islamophobia](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/17/02/anti-muslim-bias) and [anti-anti-Semitism](https://www.adl.org/education/educator-resources/lesson-plans/challenging-anti-semitism-debunking-the-myths-and) programs.\)
1.1.4.1. Con: Homeschooling [curricula](http://www.secularhomeschool.com/content/directory/secular_homeschool_full_curriculum) are nondiscriminatory and prevent racism and discrimination.
1.1.5. Pro: Once the child grows up they will be expected to work with a wide range of different people. Being deprived of interactions with people of different religions, races or values throughout their childhood will leave them ill-prepared for living in society as an adult.
1.1.5.1. Con: Homeschooling is the best way to expose children to different religions, races, values, ages, socio-economic groups, and in general greater diversity throughout their childhood, giving them exceptional preparation for living in society as an adult.
1.1.5.2. Con: Homeschooled children are already "living in society" rather than in the artificial society of school. They work outside the home at an earlier age than traditionally schooled children. They interact with a wider age group and are not constrained to peer group interactions.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Homeschooling attempts to construct a world for the child that often does not match reality. This can make adult life more challenging for the child.
1.1.5.3.1. Con: Public school attempts to construct a world for the child that often does not match reality. This can make adult life more challenging for the child.
1.1.5.4. Con: There are many parents who are concerned about the types of things being taught in schools, particularly politically left ideology, or other things that have little to do with college preparedness or life skills. As long as they're covering the [three Rs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_three_Rs), those parents should have a choice to instill their own moral values, not those of the state.
1.1.5.4.1. Con: Parents have the opportunity to instill moral values in their children outside of school as they will always be influential in their children's lives. There is no reason to keep their children from school in order to shield them from other ideas. If their morals are appealing to their children, their children will engage with them.
1.1.5.4.1.1. Con: The correctness and the attractiveness of morals are not necessarily correlated.
1.1.5.4.2. Con: If a parent feels that a school is heavily biased, they have the option to send their children to another school that feels less biased or is open to discuss and respect their values when teaching to their children.
1.1.5.4.2.1. Con: Many parents have extremely limited options for the schools they can choose from, particularly those who cannot afford private schools.
1.1.6. Con: Being educated and bonding within a faith community can be beneficial for a child's development.
1.1.6.1. Con: Children can bond with a faith community through Churches and community groups.
1.1.6.2. Con: Religious parents who feel that a beneficial faith community will be present in an accessible school will probably send their child to that school. Parents who don't think that schools can provide that should be allowed to teach their children at home.
1.1.7. Pro: While many homeschooled kids do participate in several activities, some may not receive the level of [socialization](https://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/homeschooling-101/homeschooling-socialization/) they need, which can lead to developing social phobias and extreme social awkwardness.
1.1.7.1. Con: Socialization that reflects what it actually is like to live in society means learning the skills and gaining the experience of engaging with a diverse range of people and situations.  It's much easier for children to gain real world socialization skills and experience outside of school by simply interacting with the real world.
1.1.7.1.1. Con: Traditionally schooled children can equally learn to socialize in the real world outside school bounds.
1.1.7.2. Con: There is no evidence that such phobias and awkwardness are widespread or even common.
1.1.7.3. Con: Multiple [studies](https://hslda.org/docs/nche/000000/00000068.asp) show that homeschool students are not behind socially or emotionally when compared to public schooled students.
1.1.7.3.1. Con: These are studies grouped together by a lobby group for homeschoolers, and thus it is unsurprising that they all favour homeschooling.
1.1.7.4. Con: While many government schooled kids do participate in several activities, some develop social phobias and extreme social awkwardness [that can lead to horrific consequences.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_massacres_by_death_toll) The possibility of bad results exists in both methods.
1.1.7.5. Pro: [13%](https://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/homeschooling-101/homeschooling-socialization/) of [homeschooled](https://hslda.org/docs/study/comp2001/homeschoolachievement.pdf) children in a study sample did not play with anyone outside their families.
1.1.7.5.1. Con: The 13% comes from the fact that only 87% of parents chose “playing with other children” as an explicit “school activity”. It is quite possible that parents did not consider play with other children to be a school activity.
1.1.7.5.2. Con: The 13% is only true if you count activities such as scouts, 4h clubs and playing sports with other kids as not “playing”.
1.1.7.5.3. Con: The survey did not ask if the children played with others. It asked what extra curricular activities the children were engaged in.
1.1.8. Con: Public schools claim to be about "diversity" yet teachers and teacher unions ideologically are overwhelmingly left leaning and trying to impose their social values that run contrary to those of the parents. Schools have gravitated toward conformity and indoctrination where true diversity of thought is non-existent or not tolerated.
1.2. Pro: Homeschooling often involves isolated learning environments that may lack accountability and regulations.
1.2.1. Con: This problem simply shows that more regulations should be placed on homeschooling families, not that it should be banned altogether.
1.2.1.1. Con: However, that may be difficult as homeschooling associations often advocate for not implementing regulations.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Within the US, the [Home School Legal Defense Association](http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/ovic/ViewpointsDetailsPage/ViewpointsDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Viewpoints&prodId=OVIC&action=2&catId=&documentId=GALE%7CEJ3010697213&userGroupName=lincclin_spjc&jsid=f600485f10b7b562ca70412951f6403f), the most effective educational lobby group in Washington, advocates for practically no regulation of homeschooling.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: If HSLDA is effective at preventing regulations from being passed, they will be even more effective at preventing an outright ban.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: Homeschool associations would oppose a ban a lot more vehemently than regulations.
1.2.2. Con: Parents have a great degree of control over their children regardless of whether they attend school or not. Sadly, students are vulnerable regardless of where they are educated.
1.2.2.1. Pro: In total, children spend more time at home and with family members than they do with any given person at school.
1.2.2.2. Con: Unlike formal schools where children are continually observed, there is no ongoing daily [oversight](http://theconversation.com/more-parents-are-choosing-to-home-school-their-children-why-60787) of home-schooled children leaving children more vulnerable to [abuse](http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/editorials/article195311859.html).
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Formal schools, despite monitoring, can often house and even protect teachers, students and administrators who themselves abuse students.
1.2.3. Con: Degree of state control and regulation of homeschooling is not related to academic achievement. [www.nheri.org](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/)
1.2.4. Con: Homeschooled children are abused at a [lower rate](https://www.nheri.org/child-abuse-of-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-students-evidence-philosophy-and-reason/) than are those in the general public, and no evidence shows that the home educated are at any higher risk of abuse
1.2.5. Con: No one is going to be more accountable to a child's education than his/her own parents. Generally parents have more interest in their child's welfare than a state bureaucracy.
1.2.6. Con: Rather than focus on how children are educated or schooled to find ways to reduce child neglect, abuse, and related fatalities, policymakers should pay close attention to the [report](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/cecanf_final_report.pdf) of the United States Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities \(2016\). None of their specific steps to be taken mentioned the type of schooling in which children are found nor did their recommendations include regulating or controlling any type of educational or schooling environment.
1.2.7. Pro: Unlike children who participate in a school system, homeschooled children in abusive families may not have knowledge or access to important outside resources, such as child protective services.
1.2.7.1. Pro: According to [this survey](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1469) of adult homeschool alumni, [10% of respondents](http://icher.org/blog/?p=3195) did not even know about the existence of child protective services. Moreover, 47% of the respondents \(who were aware of the services\) were afraid because they were taught that child services were prejudiced against homeschool families.
1.2.7.2. Pro: [In this survey](http://icher.org/blog/?p=3195) of homeschool alumni, 24% of all respondents [strongly agreed](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1469) that their childhood fear of child protective services did or would have prevented them from reporting child abuse to the authorities
1.2.7.2.1. Con: This is an argument for reforming child protective services to be more accountable and transparent, not ban homeschool.
1.2.7.3. Pro: According to [this survey](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1469) of homeschool alumni, 41% of respondents [stated](http://icher.org/blog/?p=3195) they were not taught how to recognize abuse.
1.2.8. Pro: Abusive parents who homeschool their children do not have to worry about a teacher noticing or reporting their children’s bruises or other physical manifestations of abuse.
1.2.9. Pro: Homeschooling gives abusive parents too much power over their children as they can control every aspect of their lives.
1.2.9.1. Pro: Homeschooling gives abusive parents the ability to deprive their children of food or confine them permanently.
1.2.9.1.1. Pro: Teachers are trained to notice and report students who seem undernourished or constantly hungry. Homeschooling gives abusive parents the [freedom](http://hsinvisiblechildren.org/themes-in-abuse/food-deprivation/) to enact torture not possible when the children are observed by teachers on a regular basis.
1.2.9.1.2. Pro: Social isolation is an emotional abuse which can occur when abusive parents have access to homeschooling.
1.2.9.1.2.1. Con: Socialization happens now in the same ways it did in the thousands of years leading up to compulsory education in brick and mortar institutions by friends in the area, siblings, group outings, etc. Being home schooled does not mean children are isolated, only that they are not at school.
1.2.9.1.2.1.1. Con: When children do not attend a regular school, the chances for socialization diminish greatly if parents decide to isolate their children.
1.2.9.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.2.9.1.2.3. Con: It is important to distinguish between legal homeschoolers who register with the state, and truants, who claim homeschooler status, but are not legally homeschooling.
1.2.9.1.2.3.1. Con: The existence of homeschools allows parents to withdraw their child from school on the pretext of homeschooling them, even if the child is truant.
1.2.9.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: [Some states](https://hslda.org/laws/) in the USA do not require parents to notify the school or state that they are withdrawing children from school, and many others merely require parents to complete a form each year.
1.2.9.1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: The fact that abusive parents can choose to homeschool to conceal their abuse is not a reason to ban homeschooling but to implement better and stricter regulations.
1.2.9.1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: After a mother killed her son \(previously withdrawn from public school to be homeschooled\), Ohio passed a [bill](https://www.hslda.org/cms/?q=bill/senate-bill-248-require-childrens-services-review-homeschooling), known as “[Teddy’s Law](https://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/teddys-law-ohios-s-b-248/)” mandating social services to be informed when parents choose to homeschool. Social services can interview parents check databases for previous concerns and ongoing investigations.
1.2.9.1.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: In some cases school districts use the lax homeschooling law as an excuse to not investigate or intervene when students are chronically truant or simply disappear from school.
1.2.9.1.2.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: A [state audit](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s222/sh/4f6fb7d2-268b-4f8a-b413-fd5810616fc2/e37784b23df0b1a4ba91d00f1fbc5ebc) in Missouri found that in one school district officials were sending a letter saying “we assume you have decided to homeschool” to the parents of any child absent from school for more than 10 days.
1.2.9.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Only twenty-five states have [assessment requirements](https://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/policy-issues/abuse-and-neglect/homeschool-law-truancy/) for homeschooled children. The lax way homeschooling is regulated in America means that it can be a tool for abusive parents.
1.2.9.1.2.3.1.3. Pro: A Sioux Falls school administrator says a state law that allows parents to educate their children at home is being used as a [truancy loophole](https://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/policy-issues/abuse-and-neglect/homeschool-law-truancy/).
1.2.9.1.2.3.1.3.1. Pro: [Director](https://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/policy-issues/abuse-and-neglect/homeschool-law-truancy/) of instructional support services for the Sioux Falls School District, Illinois, said that his district saw around 10 cases each year where parents filed requests to homeschool only when faced with prosecution for chronic truancy.
1.2.9.1.2.3.1.3.2. Pro: When principles in Illinois were [asked](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2013/05/homeschooling-to-avoid-the-truancy-officer.html) why they thought children were being withdrawn to homeschool, the answer in 25.8% of the cases was to “avoid compulsory attendance laws".
1.2.9.1.2.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: Furthermore in [17.3%](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2013/05/homeschooling-to-avoid-the-truancy-officer.html) of the cases when Illinois parents withdrew their children from these principals’ schools those parents admitted that they were doing so to avoid compulsory attendance laws.
1.2.9.1.2.3.1.3.3. Con: Using homeschooling not as a school but as a means of skipping school could be regulated rather than requiring a total ban on homeschools.
1.2.9.1.2.3.1.3.3.1. Pro: There is no reason to abolish a way of learning simply because there are some flaws within its running. In other modes of education we have developed regulations over time, homeschooling should also get this opportunity.
1.2.9.1.2.3.1.4. Con: This could be remedied by increased monitoring instead of an outright ban.
1.2.9.1.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.
1.2.9.1.2.3.3. Con: Many US states do not ask [homeschooling](http://icher.org/HRSR.htm#_edn1) parents to be registered, to comply with parent or instructor educational requirements neither do they require to keep records, a minimum of instruction time, state mandated subjects or any evaluation assessment done by the state.
1.2.9.1.2.4. Pro: There have been a small number of [cases](https://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/policy-issues/abuse-and-neglect/abuse-in-homeschooling-environments/) where homeschooled children were so isolated that they developed their own language or only spoke in grunts.
1.2.9.1.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.2.3.
1.2.9.1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.5.
1.2.9.1.3. Con: Abuse and homeschooling are statistically uncorrelated.
1.2.9.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.2.3.1.1.
1.2.9.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.2.3.1.1.1.
1.2.9.1.6. Pro: More than [380](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-captives-homeschool/california-abuse-case-sparks-calls-for-home-schooling-oversight-idUSKBN1F721R) accounts of [severe or fatal](http://hsinvisiblechildren.org/timeline/) child neglect have been recorded since 2000 in families involved in homeschooling.
1.2.9.1.6.1. Con: More incidents of severe or fatal child neglect has been reported since 2000 in families involved with public schooling. [Both in real numbers and as percentage of participants.](http://www.invisiblechildren.org/2017/12/29/child-abuse-statistics-the-best-resources/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwttbWBRDyARIsAN8zhbK9xzNmoFm8KOxpE_H7iIZT7eKQyQlCmrGuSdZQTZze_atRuJlzROkaAsLQEALw_wcB)
1.2.9.2. Pro: Sexual abuse is already [more likely](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jdibrief/crime/sexual-abuse-in-schools) to occur at home than at school.
1.2.9.3. Pro: Homeschooling [allows abusive or neglectful parents](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/19/raashanai-coley-dark-side-home-schooling) to hide their abuse from authorities as the correct welfare checks are not in place.
1.2.9.3.1. Con: This could be counteracted with regular welfare checks by authorities for homeschooled children.
1.2.10. Pro: According to a review of [74 local authorities](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/oct/13/home-education-badman-inquiry) in the UK, children educated at home are twice as likely to be known by social services \(i.e., "at risk"\) and four times more likely as young adults to be out of work, education or training than those who go to school.
1.2.10.1. Con: The review in the [source](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/oct/13/home-education-badman-inquiry) studied 1220 home-educated children. This is a small sample and might just suggest a statistic deviance in a region. For example there are [418](https://www.lgiu.org.uk/local-government-facts-and-figures/) principal councils in UK
1.2.11. Con: Homeschooling may be used as a front to mask abuse in circumstances which involve isolated and vulnerable children.
1.2.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.2.3.
1.2.12. Pro: Children homeschooled by sexually abusive parents do not have access to age-appropriate sex education that might give them the tools needed to understand and report their own abuse.
1.2.12.1. Pro: A UK report found that friends, mothers and [teachers](https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/research-reports/no-one-noticed-no-one-heard-report.pdf) were the most common people children told about abuse, including sexual abuse. Among this group, teachers are the only professionals, often equipped with protocols to deal with abuse, and the only ones who may not know perpetrators personally.
1.2.12.1.1. Pro: [One quarter](https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/research-reports/no-one-noticed-no-one-heard-report.pdf) of children who disclosed their abuse before turning 18 did so to teachers. Among professionals, they are way more likely to receive that information than social workers or policemen.
1.2.12.1.2. Con: It is false to assume that homeschooled students do not have teachers. Parents tend to be "educational directors" or "facilitators" who manage their children's teachers.
1.2.12.1.2.1. Con: States typically do not require parents to hire outside instructors in order to homeschool.
1.2.12.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.2.3.3.
1.2.12.2. Pro: [50%](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/12-confronting-statistics-on-child-sexual-abuse_us_587dab01e4b0740488c3de49) of child sexual abuse victims under the age of 6 are abused by family members. As such, it is critical that students feel comfortable talking to their teachers about these issues, because they may not be able to disclose to their parents.
1.2.12.2.1. Pro: In fact, [a study](https://www.news-medical.net/news/2005/06/20/11184.aspx) found that the most common factors amongst children who don't tell of their abuse all relate to the family home: coming from a family with rigid gender roles, family violence and bad communication in the home.
1.2.12.3. Pro: [Family loyalty](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/matter-personality/201210/why-dont-child-sex-abuse-victims-tell) is one of the biggest reasons for children keeping quiet on the abuse they have experienced.
1.2.12.3.1. Con: Family loyalty is not isolated to only homeschool families.
1.2.12.4. Con: Children may be victims of abuse in the school.
1.2.12.4.1. Pro: 48% of students surveyed in a [US study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment_in_education_in_the_United_States#cite_note-Crossing_the_Line_.282011.29-1) experienced some form of sexual harassment at school in 2010–11 and of students who had been harassed, 38% were harassed by teachers or other school employees.
1.2.12.4.2. Pro: [A school](https://www.pressreader.com/south-africa/the-sunday-independent/20171015/281530816249987) in South Africa made 83 children allegedly abused by the school guard keep quiet about the abuse in order to protect the guard.
1.2.12.5. Con: Accusations against homeschooling aren’t unique to homeschooling. Sexual abuse is as prevalent in public and private school.
1.2.12.5.1. Pro: Statistics suggest that rates of child abuse are much [higher](http://www.hsc.org/home-page.html) in traditional schools than by parents who educate their children at home.
1.2.12.6. Con: This suggests that compulsory schooling be used as a means of preventing crime which seems outside the mandate of public education.
1.2.12.6.1. Con: Schools are natural places to instil law-abiding values in children, given adherence to school rules is a fundamental part of being a member of a school community.
1.2.12.7. Pro: In [some](http://hsinvisiblechildren.org/2013/05/05/child-of-robert-caravella-and-carol-hann/) families, incest and rape takes place without the children understanding that what is happening is wrong.
1.2.12.7.1. Con: Presumably children of all educational backgrounds can have an insufficient understanding of incest and rape.
1.2.12.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.3.
1.2.13. Pro: Parents who teach their own children have less of an incentive to immunize children and [statistically](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-10-21-home-school-vaccinate_N.htm) do not.
1.2.13.1. Con: Parents who are sceptical of traditional schooling are the same sort of parents who are likely to be sceptical of vaccines. These parents would not immunise their children even if they were forced to send them to traditional schools instead of homeschooling.
1.2.13.2. Pro: Home-schooled children accounted for [25 out of 30](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-10-21-home-school-vaccinate_N.htm) cases in an outbreak of measles in suburban Chicago.
1.2.13.3. Con: Parents have a right to decide if they want to vaccinate their children or not.
1.2.13.4. Pro: Vaccines rely on herd immunity and so allowing parents this choice can be dangerous for others.
1.2.13.4.1. Con: This suggests that compulsory schooling should be instituted as a means of vaccinating children, which seems outside the mandate of education.
1.2.13.5. Con: The quoted sources are able to support correlation but not causation.
1.2.13.6. Con: -> See 1.2.13.4.1.
1.2.13.7. Con: Homeschooled students could have the same vaccination requirements as other students.
1.2.14. Pro: In a [2014 survey](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1469) of 3,700 adult homeschool alumni, [60% of respondents](http://icher.org/blog/?p=2492) who were raised in \(self-reported\) fundamentalist homes were victims of abuse as compared to 17% of respondents from non-fundamentalist families.
1.2.14.1. Pro: In [this survey](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1469), respondents from fundamentalist homes [reported](http://icher.org/blog/?p=2492) emotional abuse \(44%\), educational neglect \(27%\), physical abuse \(26%\), economic abuse \(14%\), sexual abuse \(7%\), and medical abuse \(7%\).
1.2.14.2. Con: This survey only provides comparisons among homeschooling families, but [does not draw any conclusions](http://icher.org/blog/?p=3195) about abuse statistics relative to traditional schools.
1.3. Con: A ban on homeschooling would be difficult to enforce.
1.3.1. Pro: The [1,642,027](https://a2zhomeschooling.com/thoughts_opinions_home_school/numbers_homeschooled_students/) students currently being homeschooled in the US would experience significant disruption to their education if they were forced to integrate into traditional schools.
1.3.1.1. Pro: In many areas traditional schools may not have the facilities to take in such a large number of students at once.
1.3.1.2. Con: A ban can be implemented such that no new homeschooling is permitted, but children currently being homeschooled can continue to be so until they finish their education.
1.3.2. Pro: Some families may [leave the country](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jul/18/home-school-ban-in-sweden-forces-families-to-mull-/) rather than accept a ban on homeschooling.
1.3.3. Con: Most parents are unlikely to want to raise their children outside the law.
1.3.3.1. Pro: [Thomas and Marita Sandberg of Mörbylånga](https://hslda.org/hs/international/Sweden/201702210.asp) in Sweden have had to face fines, threats and public shaming because of their refusal to stop homeschooling their children. Most parents would not endure such hardship.
1.3.3.2. Con: In countries where homeschooling is popular, opposition to a ban on homeschooling could be met with coordinated resistance.
1.3.3.3. Con: There are many examples of homeschool parents perservering in the face of enormous legal consequences. If an established homeschool community were to face a total ban, even a small percentage of resistance would present enormous challenges.
1.3.4. Pro: States may have to take children out of the custody of their parents to enforce a ban.
1.3.4.1. Pro: A [family](https://www.thelocal.de/20170406/german-parents-go-to-eu-court-after-police-seized-kids-in-homeschool-raid) in Germany temporarily lost custody of their children after illegally homeschooling them.
1.3.4.2. Pro: The Swedish government took 7 year old [Dominic Johansson](https://onenewsnow.com/education/2015/11/29/after-7-years-homeschool-boy-still-in-custody) into custody for over half a decade because his parents had been homeschooling him.
1.3.4.3. Con: Less extreme methods of enforcement such as fines can be used.
1.3.5. Con: Bans on many forms of undesirable behaviour can be difficult to enforce. Even if there are a few cases of families not abiding by the law, the vast majority would.
1.3.6. Pro: Some parents, especially abusive ones, might choose to entirely keep the fact that they have children at all as secret as possible.
1.3.6.1. Con: These parents would not be homeschooling anyway. Whether homeschooling is allowed or not, people are capable of keeping their children a secret from the rest of the world.
1.3.7. Pro: Regulation is a better solution.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Regulation offers parents options while ensuring quality control so that the state is not overrun with under-educated, anti-government religious zealots.
1.3.7.2. Pro: Regulations could include: Teaching certificate required by at least one parent; partnership with a public school who would vet curriculum and books; regular check ins with state-certified education counselor; mandated state testing; required social interaction through electives like sports or music, etc.
1.3.7.2.1. Pro: Many US homeschool parents already do exactly this, partnering with local schools to provide a kind of hybridized classroom. Many US public schools have a satellite partnership program for homeschoolers, providing funding for state vetted curricula, books, electives ...etc. Requiring face to face meetings with a counselor ...etc. Currently it is optional in many US states, however.
1.3.7.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.4. Pro: Regular schools offer a better learning setting with more qualified personnel.
1.4.1. Pro: The school system offer students greater resources and educational support than homeschooling.
1.4.1.1. Con: Home-schooling provides one-on-one education, rather than large class sizes.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: [One in eight](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/12/one-in-eight-primary-pupils-overcrowded-class) primary school pupils are taught in overcrowded classes compromising the standard of education that schools provide to children.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: The average class size in 2011–12 was 21.2 pupils for public elementary schools and 26.8 pupils for public secondary schools.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Giving children attention [increases the length](https://www.parents.com/kids/development/intellectual/how-to-improve-attention-spans/) of their attention span. A parent is more easily able to focus on a child compared to a teacher with a busy class.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Brick and mortar schools often provide tutoring at school, sometimes through peer-based or formal mentoring systems.
1.4.1.3. Con: State and government-funded schools' resources vary greatly. Some schools have great resources and ample budgets while others lack the basics.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Nearly [half](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/may02/vol59/num08/Unequal-School-Funding-in-the-United-States.aspx) of US public school funding comes from local property taxes, which means that schools in poorer areas are deprived of funding and lack resources. Parents who choose to homeschool in light of this are likely to provide a better environment.
1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: For example, Texas funds schools by district taxes - wealthier districts have better schools than poor districts.  That is because the money for schools are based on the property value of the homes in the district. Districts where the average home value is $500k would have more resources than a district where the average value of a home was $50k. This imbalance is due to the amount of tax dollars raised in the districts.
1.4.1.3.2. Pro: "[84% of schools](http://www.asiansunday.co.uk/84-of-schools-dont-have-resources-to-deal-with-childrens-mental-health-issues/) don’t have resources to deal with children’s mental health issues." Parents who home school their children have access to [resources](https://www.homeschoolingsc.org/learning-disabilities-resources/) to support their children's mental health which may not be available from schools.
1.4.1.3.2.1. Con: Parents with children who have mental health issues can give them additional support without homeschooling them.
1.4.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Additional support given by parents can be undermined by poor socializing environments in schools, rendering such approach counter-productive. Therefore, homeschooling children is a more productive way of maintaining good mental health for children.
1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Schools are not necessarily [good socialising environments](https://thebestschools.org/magazine/homeschooling-anti-social/), and more controlled home setting can be preferable.
1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Homeschooling offers protection to vulnerable children from the wrong kind of socialization.
1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Homeschooling can protect children from violence and abuse in school environments.
1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Bullying is one of the [principal reasons](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/love-in-time-homeschooling/201003/bullying-reason-homeschool) parents remove their kids from compulsory schooling and begin homeschooling.
1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Removing children from school because of bullying can have [unintended consequences](http://scarysymptoms.com/2014/08/homeschooling-bullied-child-pros-cons/) such as impaired problem solving skills and an over reliance on authority figures.
1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Homeschooling in this instance teaches a child to avoid social problems rather than develop ways of solving them.
1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: The source scarysymptoms.com isn't credible. Read the [about](https://scarysymptoms.com/2012/12/about-this-site/) and [about-me](https://scarysymptoms.com/about-me/) from the author.
1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The article is only supported by a single social workers experience. Which is both selective and subjective
1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Bullying can occur in [homeschooling](https://www.google.ie/amp/s/educatedadventures.com/2014/11/10/mean-girls-and-bullies-exist-in-homeschooling-too/amp/) situations as well. Homeschooling is not a cure for bullying.
1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: The fact that bullying occurs in homeschooling as well doesn't mean that the principal reason why parents choose homeschooling over puplic schools isn't true.
1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Children who are bullied are more likely to [experience](https://www.stopbullying.gov/at-risk/effects/index.html) depression and anxiety, health complaints and lower academic achievement. If homeschooling is what it takes to counteract those things then it is a positive step for the child.
1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.4. Pro: If a child is not comfortable being in a social environment where there can be bullies or drama etc. they and their parents should be able to decide he would be better off home-schooled. It would be morally wrong to take that right away.
1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Anti-social behavior is an inescapable reality of life that is not exclusive to a school environment. Encountering such a reality early in life provides children with the opportunity to learn how to deal with such behavior for when they encounter it in the future.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Homeschooling may not provide the opportunity for physical activities that regular schools do.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: A study found that homeschooled children have higher risks of [cardiovascular](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/josh.12588/abstract) diseases.
1.4.1.4.2. Con: Homeschooled children have been found to be [fitter](https://www.medicaldaily.com/traditionally-schooled-students-more-obese-home-schoolers-are-school-lunches-blame-260398) than children in traditional schools.
1.4.1.5. Pro: Brick and mortar schools often have computer labs, science facilities, and libraries.
1.4.1.5.1. Pro: Science facilities would allow students a greater understanding of scientific experiments than books and household products could provide.
1.4.1.5.2. Pro: Science labs are a safer environment to conduct experiments than the home.
1.4.1.6. Con: Homeschooling relies on individual and family funding. The government should provide greater resources and support.
1.4.1.7. Pro: Homeschooling offers fewer opportunities to collaborate with peers on group projects, such as class assignments, theatre/art performances, or team sports.
1.4.1.7.1. Pro: Group projects can help students [develop skills](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/design/instructionalstrategies/groupprojects/benefits.html) that are increasingly important in the professional world \(Caruso & Woolley, 2008; Mannix & Neale, 2005\).
1.4.1.7.2. Pro: Studies have shown that positive group experiences contribute to [student learning, retention and overall college success](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/design/instructionalstrategies/groupprojects/benefits.html) \(Astin, 1997; Tinto, 1998; National Survey of Student Engagement, 2006\).
1.4.1.8. Con: The school system also slows the education of students as most are not year-round, while parents could theoretically teach their children for upwards of 10 hours a day if needed.
1.4.1.8.1. Con: Regulations are put in place and designed by specialists \(pedagogues, teachers, psychologists, etc.\) to establish teaching times and vacation times according the age of pupils and their capacities. The fact that parents can increase those times may be actually harmful.
1.4.1.8.1.1. Con: Decisions such as school schedule are made by politicians, not by specialists.
1.4.1.8.1.1.1. Con: Politicians take executive decisions, but they do employ education professionals within their departments, and they also receive information from related institutions to make those decisions.
1.4.1.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: Education guidelines and rules \(including vacation periods, teaching times, curricula and evaluations\) in the UK are designed by the [Department of Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations#department-for-education) which employs several non-ministerial departments as well as advisory bodies.
1.4.1.8.1.2. Con: Long summer vacations are a relic of [agricultural societies](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/9057284/School-holidays-are-a-pointless-relic-of-the-past.html) that needed children to work during summer months. It remains only due to inertia, not on the advice of specialists.
1.4.1.8.1.2.1. Pro: [Summer learning loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_learning_loss) - where children lose a significant amount of educational progress over the summer vacation, could be avoided in a homeschooling environment.
1.4.1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.8.1.2.1.
1.4.1.9. Con: Parents who choose to home-school their children have access to local [support groups](http://home-ed.info/local_groups) that give parents access to educational support and resources for their children's educational needs.
1.4.1.9.1. Con: Just [3.4%](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oii/nonpublic/statistics.html#homeschl) of children in the US are homeschooled. It is unlikely that such a small number could sustain effective support groups across the country.
1.4.1.9.1.1. Con: Homeschooling in the United States is [growing](https://theconversation.com/heres-how-homeschooling-is-changing-in-america-63175) at a strong pace. The continued rise of the number of parents homeschooling their children will only strengthen the sustainability of supports groups in effectively supporting the educational needs of children, not hinder it.
1.4.1.9.1.2. Con: [Social media](http://homeschoolcheercolorado.com/2017/02/12/finding-homeschool-support-groups-social-media/) conveniently allows parents to reach a wider network of support groups.
1.4.1.9.2. Con: Parents cannot be forced to attend support groups or implement their advice. Professional teachers must be [certified and evaluated](http://www.futureacademy.org.uk/files/images/upload/184.pdf) and are more likely to use effective pedagogical techniques.
1.4.1.9.2.1. Con: There are over [1,500](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/05/15/what-if-finlands-great-teachers-taught-in-u-s-schools-not-what-you-think/?utm_term=.a17fa11e3d8f) different teacher qualifications in the US, of varying quality. The consistent application of "best practice" in public schools does not occur.
1.4.1.9.2.1.1. Con: Well-regarded educational systems that consistently get the best international results like Singapore or Finland have only “one academically rigorous [teacher education program](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/05/15/what-if-finlands-great-teachers-taught-in-u-s-schools-not-what-you-think/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.6f3ff9230f04)” and other countries like Canada or South Korea do not have “fast-track options into teaching” \(like Teach for America\).
1.4.1.9.2.1.2. Con: That may be a failure from the US educational system that could be reformed, yet it does not mean traditional education cannot offer high-quality certified teachers as many countries manage to achieve.
1.4.1.9.2.1.3. Con: Parents homeschooling will also have inconsistent application of best practice.
1.4.1.9.2.2. Con: Notice the use of "force." Advocating coercion is not advocating effective learning. Notice the misuse of "advice." [Advice](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/advice) does not include forced implementation. Using the vocabulary of persuasion to advocate a policy of coercion is dishonest. "More likely" is asserted without support.
1.4.1.9.2.3. Pro: In Europe, the [requirements](http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/documents/key_data_series/134EN.pdf) to become a pre-primary and primary teacher  require a Bachelor’s degree or equivalent, which takes 3 to 4 years of study and some countries even require a Master’s level. Al lower secondary level, initial teacher education requires a Bachelor’s level and a Master's level, usually around five years. In a lot of countries, teachers also must undergo an induction period.
1.4.1.9.3. Pro: Support groups are able to organise special [seminars and classes](http://www.outlookacademy.org/support-group/88-benefits-of-a-homeschool-support-group) for children pertaining to subjects that are considered difficult to be taught at home.
1.4.1.9.4. Pro: Support groups organize [seminars](http://www.outlookacademy.org/support-group/88-benefits-of-a-homeschool-support-group) for parents on home school topics. Parents can use the skills and information they acquire from these seminars to provide greater educational support for their children.
1.4.1.9.5. Pro: Support groups allow for the [sharing, buying and exchanging](http://www.outlookacademy.org/support-group/88-benefits-of-a-homeschool-support-group) of goods and services with other members pertaining to the educational needs of children.
1.4.1.9.6. Pro: Support groups will give the opportunity for parents to meet and exchange teaching ideas or work through any difficulties they may be facing in trying to meet the educational needs of their children.
1.4.2. Pro: Certified teachers are likely to educate children better than parents.
1.4.2.1. Con: Teachers do not have a continuing relationship with students that allows them to fully understand how to work with them, while parents can observe their children from birth.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: While parents can change learning strategies to find the ones that best suit their children, teachers do not have the time, resources or the adequate setting to do so.
1.4.2.2. Con: Teachers often have to teach children to improve test scores, not necessarily to improve learning.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Given exam performance determines college/university entry and future job applications, they are a fundamental part of doing well in an educational sense.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: In many areas, teachers are [assessed and evaluated](http://www.nea.org/tools/fighting-stress-teaching-to-Test.html) based on test scores. When teachers' wages and career prospects are based on pupils' test scores, they have an incentive to focus on improving those rather than taking a more holistic educational approach.
1.4.2.3. Con: Teacher quality varies widely, and is highly associated with the [wealth](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/09/teachers-in-deprived-schools-more-likely-to-be-inexperienced) of the school's catchment area. Parents shouldn't have to send their children to sub-par teachers.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Worse off areas tend to present more challenging teaching environments. Experienced teachers with better job prospects gravitate towards schools where their job will be easier.
1.4.2.4. Pro: Teaching is a [skill](https://www.suttontrust.com/newsarchive/improving-the-learning-of-teachers/) which can be improved. Teachers have an entire career to practice and improve and are often required to have teaching qualifications, whilst parents rarely receive any form of training.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.9.2.
1.4.2.4.2. Con: Parents who teach from a young age will have over a decades experience by the time their child is finished, more if they have multiple children.
1.4.2.4.2.1. Con: This is not useful for their eldest children and insinuates that the first few years of homeschooling will be subpar. Education should be consistently of a high standard.
1.4.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Teachers in regular schools can also be inexperienced.
1.4.2.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Teachers in regular schools will not be hired unless they have completed a higher level degree or a specific teacher training course.
1.4.2.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Training and experience are entirely different things. A teacher can be well educated and inexperienced.
1.4.2.4.2.1.1.2. Con: In America someone hoping to apply for a [teaching license](https://www.learnhowtobecome.org/teacher/) must have completed a certain number of hours of supervised education experience. The number changes depending on the state.
1.4.2.5. Pro: Parents are biased mentors and therefore may not be the best choice of teacher.
1.4.2.5.1. Pro: Parents who love their children are less able to objectively assess their child's educational needs. For instance, they may be less likely to admit that their child has difficulty reading and fail to give them the additional support they need in that area.
1.4.2.5.1.1. Con: Government employees, whose paycheck is at risk, are less able to objectively assess students' educational needs. For instance, [certified teachers may be less likely to admit that their students have difficulty reading](http://theconversation.com/why-school-leaders-fake-academic-success-91034) and fail to give them the additional support they need. [The Atlanta test scores scandal is one example of this](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/us/atlanta-school-workers-sentenced-in-test-score-cheating-case.html).
1.4.2.5.2. Con: Government employees are biased mentors and therefore may not be the best choice of teacher.
1.4.2.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.
1.4.2.6. Pro: According to surveys in the US, 75% parents who [homeschool](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2016/2016096rev.pdf) did not take any course \(online or in person\) to prepare for their child’s home instruction.
1.4.2.6.1. Con: There is no indication that such preparation improves outcomes.
1.4.2.6.1.1. Con: In this [test](https://www.parentingscience.com/homeschooling-outcomes.html) homeschooled children whose parents were engaged in pre bought curricula or pre planned lesson plans did significantly better than unstructured homeschoolers.
1.4.2.6.2. Con: These same untrained parents have already proven ability to teach a child incredibly complex things. In particular, almost any parent of a 5 year old \(nearing school age\) has already taught that child complex motor skills \(walking or crawling\), to speak, and a myriad of other things. Therefore, that parent has proven success in teaching that child, while the certified teacher only has formal education.
1.4.2.6.2.1. Con: Almost all parents teach children \(or help them learn\) how to speak and walk. However, that does not mean they have the knowledge and tools to teach them complex mathematical equations, art history or a foreign language.
1.4.2.7. Con: In the [US](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/) the home-educated typically score 15 to 30 percentile points above public-school students on standardized academic achievement tests. This would prove that parents tend to be better teachers.
1.4.2.7.1. Con: The studies that allegedly prove this [use data from volunteers](http://www.icher.org/faq_worldwide.html) responding to an invitation by the nation’s most prominent advocacy organisation to contribute test scores administered by parents at home. The data is therefore not reliable.
1.4.2.7.2. Con: These studies generally do not include other [variables](https://hslda.org/docs/news/2016/201606240.asp) \(such as demographics, income, and parent’s education\) which may be [responsible](https://www.nheri.org/homeschool-sat-scores-for-2014-higher-than-national-average/) for the higher results.
1.4.2.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.2.3.3.
1.4.2.9. Pro: In schools children are taught by a range of different teachers, who have different strengths and personalities. This is more beneficial than being taught by one person for your entire education, as may happen in homeschooling.
1.4.2.9.1. Con: Inconsistency in approach and unfamiliarity with the student can be a significant detriment to the quality of education.
1.4.2.10. Con: Homeschool parents are teachers. Presuming the nouns are mutually exclusive sets up a false dichotomy.
1.4.2.10.1. Con: There is a difference between someone who teaches something and someone who has a higher level degree in teaching and professionally teaches. If we were to refer to everyone who has taught children skills as teachers the word would lose meaning.
1.4.2.10.1.1. Pro: Saying that parents who teach their children should be referred to by the same name as teachers is disrespectful to the people who have studied for years to gain the accreditation necessary to become a teacher.
1.4.2.10.1.1.1. Con: Advocating for the banning of independent, parent-directed education is much far more than "disrespectful" to people who have taught for years independently from State accreditation.
1.4.2.10.1.2. Con: There is a difference between someone who spends sixteen years complying with State indoctrination so that they can derive an income from State taxation in exchange for indoctrinating a compelled audience... and someone who freely chooses to teach without compensation.
1.4.2.10.1.3. Con: This example of arbitrarily narrowing the definition of a noun \(teacher\) to exclude people who engage in the corresponding verb \(teach\) is a form of  discrimination that seeks to [disenfranchise](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disenfranchise) a minority.
1.4.2.10.1.3.1. Con: It is not a question of discrimination but credentials. Someone who has an education in teaching and is a certified teacher is different than someone that has no education. In the same vein that someone can recommend a medication, yet that does not make that person a pharmacist or a doctor.
1.4.2.11. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.4.3. Con: Many states have powers to regulate or inspect the quality of the homeschooled child's education to ensure it meets their needs.
1.4.3.1. Pro: In the United Kingdom, the relevant Local Authority can [issue a notice](https://childlawadvice.org.uk/information-pages/home-education/) to parents asking them to demonstrate that their child is receiving a sufficient education. If they cannot do so, the Authority can serve a School Attendance Order, compelling them to attend school.
1.4.3.2. Pro: In New South Wales \(the most populous state in Australia\), parents must prove that the child's education will accord with state standards, and that the educational system and timetable the parent wishes to use is suitable for the child \([Guidelines for Home Schooling Registration in NSW, p.9](http://Guidelines for Home Schooling Registration in NSW)\).
1.4.3.3. Pro: In Ontario \(the most populous state in Canada\), if a school board has reasonable grounds to suspect that the instruction provided at home is not satisfactory, it may open an [inquiry](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/extra/eng/ppm/131.html) into the child's education, and if it is determined that the child is not receiving an acceptable education, it can compel their attendance at school [\(s24\(2\) Education Act\)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90e02#top).
1.4.3.4. Con: The regulatory and inspection process takes time to complete. If it finds that a child is in a substandard educational environment, it cannot undo the damage done in the time that the child was in that environment.
1.4.3.4.1. Con: Every system, including compulsory public education and private schooling, will have students who are abused. The possibility of damage is not sufficient to justify banning homeschool.
1.4.3.5. Con: Homeschooling is sometimes highly unregulated and lacks proper monitoring.
1.4.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.2.3.3.
1.4.3.5.2. Con: Monitoring is not an indication of quality.
1.4.3.5.2.1. Con: Monitoring ensures institutions are reaching a baseline quality standard. This is crucial as children have [a right](https://downloads.unicef.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/UNCRC_summary.pdf) to an acceptable quality of education.
1.4.3.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.
1.4.3.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.
1.4.3.6. Con: Among European countries that allow homeschooling, regulations are [highly localized](https://gaither.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/how-european-nations-regulate-home-education-and-how-they-could-do-it-better/), and therefore inconsistent and insufficiently transparent.
1.4.4. Con: Whether homeschool parents are \(or were ever\) certified teachers is [not related](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/) to their children’s academic achievement.
1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.12.1.2.
1.4.5. Con: Homeschool students score [above average](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/) on achievement tests regardless of their parents’ level of formal education or their family’s household income.
1.4.5.1. Con: Much of the research in this area is conducted by pro-homeschool lobby groups, using unreliable data gathering and analysis techniques.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: The National Home Education Research Institute, which produces the Home School Researcher \(a journal\) is [closely aligned](https://gaither.wordpress.com/2008/10/07/brian-d-ray-and-nheri-part-2/) with the Home School Defence League Association, the largest homeschool lobby group in the country.
1.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: The [call for responses](http://masshope.org/index.php?sub=Research_Study) to an NHERI study openly referenced the fact that the study would be used to promote homeschooling by the HSDLA, before data had been gathered and analysed.
1.4.5.1.1.2. Pro: The NHERI's [homeschooling fact page](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/) only includes articles that conclude homeschooling has extremely positive effects. This calls into question their independence from the outcomes of their research.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: Homeschooling studies often rely on self-reported data from parents, which is necessarily unreliable.
1.4.5.1.2.1. Pro: The type of parents asked influences the results: [a richer, whiter sample group](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1440) will lead to results that show homeschooled children do 'better', when it may merely demonstrate that that demographic is more likely to succeed.
1.4.5.1.2.2. Pro: Parents have to voluntarily sign up for tests to contribute data to these studies. Parents of children who are likely to do better are [more likely](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1440) to put them forward for the test, which creates a reporting problem.
1.4.5.1.2.3. Pro: [Low response rates](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1440) can skew the study towards more motivated parents who wish to report on how well their children are doing.
1.4.6. Con: Boys suffer in public schools. A highly disproportionate number of public school's special-education students are boys. Boys are [2.5 times as likely](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/) as girls in public schools to be diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder \(ADHD\).
1.4.6.1. Pro: It is not surprising that boys do not do well when they are expected to sit at a desk and do low grade clerical work for 6 hours a day. During free play girls often sit in a circle to play. Boys never do, they run around. Schools cater to girls' style of learning and boys are suffering as a result.
1.4.6.1.1. Pro: Due to the fact that girls have more [serotonin and oxytocin](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-gail-gross/how-boys-and-girls-learn-differently_b_5339567.html) they are more able to sit for longer periods of time than boys who may crave movement.
1.4.7. Con: [Educator sexual abuse](https://www.sesamenet.org/) in public schools is widespread.
1.4.7.1. Pro: 1 in 10 of all k-12 students is a victim of educator sexual misconduct. [www.sesamenet.org](https://www.sesamenet.org/) and [docs.wixstatic.com](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/b75d1b_47372ea36dd5443b823dff21aa8f0aea.pdf)
1.4.7.2. Con: -> See 1.2.9.2.
1.4.8. Con: Peer pressure, violence, bullying, sexual assault and drugs can all make traditional schools a very poor learning environment.
1.4.9. Con: [Teachers](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-public-school-teacher-white-nationalist-podcast_us_5a99ae32e4b089ec353a1fba) with racist, sexist and hateful viewpoints have traumatized, and worse, influenced entire classrooms of students.
1.4.9.1. Con: Unlike homeschooling, in which parents may have total reign, regular school systems have measures in place to prevent discriminatory behaviors from teachers. The teacher mentioned in the [article](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-public-school-teacher-white-nationalist-podcast_us_5a99ae32e4b089ec353a1fba) has been [removed](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-school-removes-teacher-who-hosted-white-nationalist-podcast-n853096) from the classroom and there is an ongoing investigation.
1.4.9.1.1. Pro: If white nationalist and racist homeschooling parents shared the same views as mentioned above with their children, no one would stop them from doing so.
1.4.9.2. Con: -> See 1.4.9.1.1.
1.4.10. Con: Each person needs their own process to learn. School creates a system where intelligent children need to slow down their learning and get bored, and slow children are forced to learn too fast to understand each subject fully. Homeschooling creates the perfect environment for personalized learning and a better understanding of each subject.
1.4.11. Con: Not all schools and homes are the same.  In areas with poor schools, homeschooling may be a better choice. For children with well suited parents, homeschooling may be a better choice.
1.4.12. Con: There is no "better" learning setting, but rather a variety of different approaches that work for different children.
1.4.13. Pro: In Research based on Homeschooled children who have ASD it was found that a little over fifty per cent of those surveyed did not meet the legal requirement of hours of studying \(4.5 per day\) and did not receive instruction in all required content areas. \([pp.27](https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/simmons_christina_a_201405_ma.pdf)\)
1.5. Pro: Homeschooling allows parents to give their children a biased education.
1.5.1. Con: Schools also can give a biased education.
1.5.1.1. Con: Homeschooled young adults are [no more religious](https://newrepublic.com/article/122987/does-homeschooling-make-children-more-religious) than demographically similar young people who attended public or private schools.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: In some cases, studies found religious homeschooled students to be more open and [tolerant](https://newrepublic.com/article/122987/does-homeschooling-make-children-more-religious) than their compulsorily educated peers.
1.5.1.2. Pro: A [report](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24018762/ns/us_news-education/t/student-sees-political-bias-high-school-text/) has highlighted that there is conservative political bias in how science is being taught in US schools, particularly with regards to the subject of global warming.
1.5.1.3. Pro: There is evidence to suggest that there is a liberal bias in how politics is being taught at a US high school, which has left children who hold minority political views feeling alienated.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: A [poll](https://waylandstudentpress.com/57896/articles/opinion-there-is-liberal-bias-at-wayland-high-school/) has found that "54% of students with a minority political view felt that their views are not well represented in the school, and about 1 out of 3 of these students felt scared to share their views in the classroom because they feel that students and teachers would judge them."
1.5.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.
1.5.1.4. Pro: China openly uses its school system to promote patriotism and the communist party. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/world/asia/china-school-long-march.html)
1.5.1.5. Pro: A [report](http://www.independentpressjournal.com/2017/07/16/gene-ponder-book-list-the-untold-story/) has found that children were given a biased summer reading assignment by their 12th grade Government & Economics teacher at a US high school. Most of the books on the assignment list were heavily slanted towards a conservative political ideology.
1.5.1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.5.4.2.
1.5.2. Con: Parents are ultimately responsible for their children, and therefore have a right to decide how they are raised.
1.5.2.1. Con: Parents may not choose to raise their children in a neglectful or abusive manner. If homeschooling is shown to be similarly damaging, then parents' rights are an unimportant consideration.
1.5.2.2. Pro: Parents should be allowed to share their values with their children.
1.5.2.3. Con: If parents have a right to teach their kids wrong information, then companies should definitely have the right to not hire people who have been homeschooled.
1.5.2.4. Pro: Parents have extremely onerous legal obligations they have to discharge with regard to their children: these obligations confer a right to determine what is best for their children.
1.5.3. Pro: Some religious groups advocate homeschooling as a way of ensuring children have the same values as their parents, providing an education that lack different perspectives.
1.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.
1.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.5.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.
1.5.3.4. Con: Research about [homeschooling](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2014/05/not-all-homeschoolers-are-religious-but-many-are.html) suggests that evangelical and fundamentalist Christians were the first groups to engage in homeschooling. Nowadays, however, there is growing number of progressive families who view homeschooling as a [better](http://www.businessinsider.com/reasons-homeschooling-is-the-smartest-way-to-teach-kids-today-2018-1) and freer way to educate. [Non-religious](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/homeschooling-without-god/475953/) Homeschooling is growing in the US and [Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/11/unschool-children-monitor-home-schooling-education).
1.5.3.5. Pro: The Quiverfull movement \(a group of conservative Christian couples associated with the evangelical right in the USA\) [promote homeschooling](https://daily.jstor.org/the-duggars-sexual-abuse-christian-homeschool-movement/) as a way of ensuring children adopt the fundamentalist values of the movement.
1.5.3.6. Pro: Adult homeschool alumni report that their teaching came from a [particular ideological slant](http://icher.org/blog/?p=2492). 75.3% of respondents to [this survey](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1469) stated they were taught the superiority of a particular political ideology; 62.2% were taught the superiority of a particular political party; and 42.9% said their form of Christianity emphasized a specific economic theory.
1.5.3.7. Pro: Due to lack of standards and oversight, homeschool students might not learn about mainstream scientific theories that are inconsistent with their parents beliefs.
1.5.3.7.1. Pro: In this 2014 [survey](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1469) of homeschool alumni, 79.9% of respondents [reported](http://icher.org/blog/?p=2492) they were taught[Young Earth Creationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism). Only 2% of the sample were taught evolution. The survey found that being taught evolution was correlated with a higher rating of science instruction by respondents.
1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.6.
1.5.5. Pro: Parents should not be not the sole influencer of children: Both society and the government have a right to influence a child's development.
1.5.5.1. Con: Parents are very rarely the sole influencer of homeschooled children.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: Parents have complete control in a homeschooling situation. Depending on the parent's personalities homeschooling has the [potential](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-sinister-side-of-homeschooling) to be isolated to the parents teachings.
1.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: The website "[Homescholing's Invisible Children](http://hsinvisiblechildren.org/)" documents a constantly growing list of seriously abused children whose abuse was exasperated by isolated homeschooling.
1.5.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Unfortunately this web site conflates "truancy" with "homeschooling". It is well known that removing children from school is correlated with abuse, but that legal homeschooling demonstrates significantly less abuse than in the general population.
1.5.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.2.3.1.
1.5.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: Among children victims of severe abuse, 29% were not allowed to attend school, 12% were withdrawn from school without explanation and 47% were withdrawn to be [homeschooled](https://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/homeschooling-101/reasons-parents-homeschool/).
1.5.5.1.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.2.3.1.1.1.
1.5.5.1.1.2. Con: Potential misuse of freedom is not generally considered cause to eliminate the freedom outright.
1.5.5.2. Pro: The government plays a part in protecting the child and because of the important role the future adult will play as a citizen of society they should have an input.
1.5.5.3. Con: In a free society, the government is influenced by the people, not the people by government.
1.5.5.3.1. Con: In most democratic societies, people elect a government that has the mandate to legislate and enforce laws, thus influencing people’s behaviors and actions.
1.5.5.3.2. Pro: The Government's job is not to influence children in any way.
1.5.5.4. Pro: The government and society play an integral role in developing the personality of children.
1.5.5.4.1. Pro: [Cultural-Historical Theory](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1413-73722014000400587&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en) informs us that the development of personality is dependent on the integration of the individual into society which is full of demands, expectations and habits. It is during childhood the first levels of formation of an individual's personality are established through social activity.
1.5.5.4.1.1. Pro: Therefore the systematized educative process that takes place in the childhood school through subjecting children to an array of social activities plays an important and necessary role in the psycho-physiological development of a child's personality.
1.5.5.4.2. Pro: The government and society play an important role in building the character of children which parents alone are unable to do so.
1.5.5.4.2.1. Pro: [Research](https://www2.ed.gov/parents/academic/help/citizen/partx1.html) indicates that children take values seriously only when they see that the adults they respect agree with those values. Although parents must be the ones to determine which values they want their children to develop, they need the help of the community, particularly the schools, in reinforcing those values.
1.5.5.4.2.2. Pro: Schools encourage children to participate in activities and socialise with different groups of people both inside and outside of school. Subjecting children to such a diverse learning environment encourages children to break free from their comfort zone which helps to build their character.
1.5.5.5. Con: Both the government and society are allowed to infuence a child’s worldview. However, they don't have the “right” to. If parents chose to limit this exposure it is technically their right to allow this while the child is under age.
1.5.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.3.
1.5.6. Pro: Children should be allowed to explore and engage with alternative beliefs that their parents do not hold. They can then choose the beliefs that are most appealing to them. Traditional schools are more likely to facilitate this process.
1.5.6.1. Pro: If children are shut off from alternative viewpoints at an early age, it may mean they can never truly understand or appreciate them.
1.5.6.2. Con: Access to the internet, television, and other people they interact with in their lives, makes it fairly unlikely that they would not be able to explore and engage with alternative beliefs.
1.5.6.2.1. Con: This assumes that the children in question have access to the internet, television and a diverse range of people.
1.5.6.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.5.6.3. Pro: Teachers have been trained to systematically explain a diversity of beliefs.
1.5.6.4. Pro: Unlike a child's parents, teachers are more neutral because they have less of a personal attachment and agenda to what the child ends up believing.
1.5.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.6.
1.5.6.6. Con: The thesis that children should choose the belief that is most appealing to them is itself a belief. Forcing that belief on them is no better than forcing them to believe any other philosophical or religious position.
1.5.6.6.1. Con: Forcing choice upon someone is not the same as forcing a belief upon them. It is inherent in growing up that children eventually have to be capable of making their own choices.
1.5.6.6.1.1. Con: Forcing choice on someone is a positive assertion that there is no correct answer, which is itself a philosophical and religious position.
1.5.6.7. Con: Even if children go to schools, depending on the parents, children might recieve narrow view of society.
1.6. Con: Homeschooling allows parents to teach children according to their beliefs.
1.6.1. Pro: Parents can build a better relationship with their child if they can ensure they share the same religious beliefs.
1.6.1.1. Con: Religious views shouldn't get in the way of someone's relationship with their children. One should be able to discuss different religions and make sure their children understand why they believe in them. If discussing a religion is forbidden, then it's not a healthy religion, it's a sect.
1.6.2. Pro: Being educated in a typical school can make it less likely that children maintain the beliefs and worldview of their parents into adulthood.
1.6.2.1. Con: If people can "convert" other adults into their same religion, that religion probably has values that children can learn to appreciate and respect when compared to other religions.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: Whether there are positive elements or not to a religion, there should be an aspect of choice in something so influential to a person's life.
1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.6.6.
1.6.2.2. Pro: Some [mennonites](http://www.intentionalhands.com/why-we-homeschool/) homeschool to better inculcate their beliefs in their children.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Most [mennonite schools](http://www.canadianmennonite.org/articles/whats-become-mennonite-schools) are private. This means that parents who don't have the finances to sent their children to one may feel that homeschooling is the only option, if they want their child to be reared with mennonitie beliefs in mind.
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.
1.6.4. Con: In a 2014 survey of 3,700 adult Christian homeschool alumni, many reported that they [no longer shared](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1469) the religious beliefs of their family. Current attitudes toward the religion of their parents were bimodal, with a substantial minority viewing the religion unfavorably.
1.6.4.1. Con: Even though many homeschool alumni may reject their parents faith, [a majority of those surveyed](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1469) still viewed their family's religion favorably.
1.6.4.2. Pro: This effectively shows that children educated by parents with Christian beliefs are able to "think for themselves" and not blindly follow their parents beliefs.
1.6.4.3. Con: Four out of five of the children still identified as Christian. That leaves only 20 per cent of the people surveyed no longer sharing the religious beliefs of their family. With the [huge rates](http://coldcasechristianity.com/2018/are-young-people-really-leaving-christianity/) of young people leaving the church, in comparison this statistic is very low.
1.6.5. Con: -> See 1.5.5.
1.6.6. Con: -> See 1.5.6.
1.6.7. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.
1.6.8. Pro: It's the parents duty to regulate society's influences on their children.
1.6.8.1. Pro: Parents have authority over their children. This means that they also have a moral obligation to act in the best interest of their children. This includes acts to protect their children from harm and acts to expose their children to society at large.
1.6.8.2. Pro: Parents can move to regions or areas that benefits their children, thereby regulating which society influences their children.
1.7. Con: Homeschooling provides a superior education to compulsory schooling.
1.7.1. Pro: Homeschooled students in the US have a [9.2% higher](https://www.statisticbrain.com/home-school-statistics/) college graduation rate than compulsorily schooled students.
1.7.1.1. Con: This study relies upon participants responding to mail asking them to fill in surveys \('direct response mail'\). As opposed to data from schools, there is no mechanism to ensure the test score provided by parents is true, nor to prevent the selection bias caused by parents of more successful children being more likely to respond.
1.7.2. Pro: US homeschooled students are ranked in the 77th percentile academically, [27% higher](https://www.statisticbrain.com/home-school-statistics/) than compulsorily schooled students.
1.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.
1.7.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.2.7.2.
1.7.3. Pro: The home-educated score [above average](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/) on measures of social, emotional, and psychological development. Research measures include peer interaction, self-concept, leadership skills, family cohesion, participation in community service, and self-esteem.
1.7.4. Pro: [Research](https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/1195/ajp-age-mixing-published.pdf) consistently shows that mixed-aged learning, a feature of homeschooling, is superior to education constrained to classes of students within a year of one another's birth.
1.7.4.1. Pro: In mixed-age classrooms, children are more likely to cooperate than compete. [www.vineacademy.com](https://www.vineacademy.com/benefits-of-mixed-age-classes/)
1.7.4.2. Pro: Children in same-grade classrooms may be labeled as "below grade level" or "low." [www.vineacademy.com](https://www.vineacademy.com/benefits-of-mixed-age-classes/)
1.7.4.3. Pro: Mixed-age classrooms generate a "family of learners" who support and care for one another.  Older children have the opportunity to serve as mentors and take leadership roles. They model sophisticated approaches to problem solving,  helping younger children to accomplish tasks they would not be able to do independently. This dynamic increases the older child’s level of independence and competence and increases the younger child’s spirit of belonging in a community of learners. [www.vineacademy.com](https://www.vineacademy.com/benefits-of-mixed-age-classes/)
1.7.5. Pro: Research in [Australia](http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/policy-research/pdf_doc/home-schooling-outcomes-review.pdf) shows that homeschooled children achieve slightly better academic outcomes in most learning areas.
1.7.5.1. Con: However, the available data comes only from a small [minority](http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/policy-research/pdf_doc/home-schooling-outcomes-review.pdf) of homeschooled children \(10%\) that have participated in voluntary tests.
1.7.6. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.7.7. Con: -> See 1.4.5.1.
1.7.8. Con: -> See 1.4.3.5.
1.7.9. Con: -> See 1.4.13.
1.7.10. Con: If the homeschooled child cannot demonstrate competency in skills through testing then they must be required to get an education elsewhere.
1.7.10.1. Con: Students who cannot demonstrate competency in public or private schools are not required to get an education elsewhere. It is unreasonable to apply that standard solely to homeschools.
1.8. Con: Homeschooled children benefit from greater safety and well-being.
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.
1.8.3. Pro: [95%](https://hslda.org/research/ray2003/Socialization.asp) of 7000 homeschool graduates are glad they were homeschooled. 82% plan to homeschool their children.
1.8.4. Pro: Legally homeschooled students are [40% less likely](https://www.nheri.org/child-abuse-neglect-fatalities-not-correlated-homeschooling/) to die by child abuse or neglect than the average student nationally. Truants, by contrast, are seven times as likely to die as the average student nationally.
1.8.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.2.3.1.
1.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.
1.8.6. Con: [80% of Christian homeschooling families](https://hareachingout.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/installment7.pdf) have negative attitudes towards LGBT rights, and are therefore unlikely to provide a supportive educational environment if their child is LGBT.
1.8.7. Con: -> See 1.4.1.4.
1.8.8. Pro: Gun violence is [epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States) in America's public schools.
1.8.8.1. Pro: Trauma from gun violence affects not only survivors or gun trauma, but those preparing to defend themselves against gun violence, as public schools are now required to do. [www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/i-would-rather-not-be-alone-behind-their-anger-florida-students-are-still-teens-struggling-with-trauma/2018/02/20/5e21bb40-1661-11e8-8b08-027a6ccb38eb_story.html?)
1.8.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
1.8.10. Pro: According to data collected by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, adolescent religious homeschoolers were less likely to report having been [arrested or booked](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1297) \(1.6%, compared to 3.3% of religious conventionally schooled.\)
1.8.11. Pro: According to data collected by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, adolescent religious homeschoolers were far less likely to report a [substance disorder](http://icher.org/blog/?p=1297) \(3.0% for religious home vs. 6.1% of religious conventionally schooled and 15.8% of less religious home\).

1.8.14. Con: -> See 1.2.13.
1.8.15. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.6.
1.9. Con: Homeschoolers are better socialized than compulsorily schooled students.
1.9.1. Pro: Adults who were homeschooled are more [politically tolerant](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/) than the public schooled.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Homeschooled students grasp the workings of [politics and government](https://hslda.org/research/ray2003/Civic.asp) better than the traditionally schooled. 35% of U.S. adults consider politics and government too complicated to understand, compared to 4.2% of homeschool graduates.
1.9.2. Pro: Homeschoolers are [more politically involved](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/). Over 76% of 18-24 yr old homeschool graduates voted in a national/state election the past 5 years compared with just 29 percent of 18- to 24-year-old public school graduates. When they reach the age of 25-39, 95 percent of homeschool graduates vote. They are also more than twice as involved in campaigns, candidate contributions, and boycotts.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Research evidence supports claims that homeschoolers are more politically active and engaged \([Knowles & Muchmore, 1995; Ray, 2004; and Van Pelt, Allison, & Allison, 2009](https://www.nheri.org/the-harms-of-homeschooling-where-are-the-premises-2/)\).
1.9.3. Pro: Homeschoolers are significantly more [involved in their communities.](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/) Over 71% of homeschoolers participate in voluntary associations vs. 37% of U.S. adults.
1.9.4. Pro: Homeschooled students avoid negative peer influences that children may be exposed to in traditional schools.
1.9.4.1. Con: Homeschooled students may also miss the positive peer influences that children find in traditional schools.
1.9.4.1.1. Con: While positive peer influences can come outside of a school environments, the negative influences there cannot be as easily avoided.
1.9.4.2. Pro: Social trends spread quickly in traditional school environments, due to the size of the social network and high number of constant interactions between students.
1.9.4.3. Con: Homeschool students can be equally exposed to peer pressure on the internet and social media networks.
1.9.4.3.1. Con: Parents can much more easily monitor, control and help children cope with electronic peer pressure than physical in person pressure at a school.
1.9.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.
1.9.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.11.
1.9.5. Pro: Homeschooled students are able to [nurture their individuality](https://www.nheri.org/2007/08/27/social-skills-and-satisfaction-with-social-relationships/) outside of the conformist environment of traditional schools.
1.9.5.1. Con: Schools offer a variety of environments for social development. Students can choose whichever extracurricular activities or elective classes suit their interests.
1.9.5.2. Pro: Across the world, homeschooled students report higher average levels of [self-concept](http://www.moorefoundation.com/article/49/faqs/self-concept-in-home-schooling-children) \(i.e., sense of identity and "self"\) than conventionally schooled students.
1.9.5.2.1. Pro: According to a survey of US homeschooling associations, half of homeschoolers scored [at or above the 91st percentile of self-concept](http://www.moorefoundation.com/article/49/faqs/self-concept-in-home-schooling-children) on a global scale. This may be due to higher achievement and mastery levels, independent study characteristics, or one-on-one tutoring situations in the home-school environment.
1.9.6. Pro: One study \([Shyers 1992](https://www.nheri.org/2007/08/27/social-skills-and-satisfaction-with-social-relationships/)\) used non-self-report methodologies to compare the social skills of home-schooled children to traditionally schooled children. The researcher matched home-schooled and non-home-schooled children. He then had naïve observers rate the social skills of all child participants. Traditionally schooled participants had eight times the number of problem behaviors \(such as being aggressive and overly competitive\) that the home-schooled children had.
1.9.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.
1.9.8. Con: -> See 1.1.7.
1.9.9. Con: -> See 1.4.5.1.
1.9.10. Con: -> See 1.4.1.7.
1.9.11. Con: Homeschooled children may experience difficulties transitioning to college because they have not previously experienced traditional education.
1.9.11.1. Con: Students prepared through the traditional method are not necessarily prepared completely either.
1.9.11.2. Con: The overall conclusion of this study was that homeschooled women were 'socially capable, academically skilled, self-motivated to learn, close to their families, yet capable of living an independent life' \([San Clemente, p. 247](http://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3983&context=dissertations)\).
1.9.11.3. Con: During their freshman year of college, homeschooled students scored significantly lower in anxiety, and no difference was found between them and traditionally schooled students on the remaining scales. Additionally, home schooled students reported fewer symptoms of emotional distress and social problems, and achieving higher first semester GPAs. [www.nheri.org](https://www.nheri.org/2007/12/31/homeschooled-students-adjustment-to-college/)
1.9.11.4. Pro: This study reported that some homeschooled women felt held captive by their parents ideology which held them back in college. [\(San Clemente, p. 117\)](http://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3983&context=dissertations)
1.9.11.4.1. Con: This study only included 11 participants and at that, only a minority expressed the sentiment that they felt held captive by their parents ideology. This is not sufficient evidence to conclude that this is a trend for homeschoolers who attend college.
1.9.11.5. Con: According to [this study](http://i.bnet.com/blogs/homeschool.pdf), homeschooled students graduated college at a rate of 66.7% compared to a rate of 57.5% for non-schooled home students. Additionally, homeschooled students achieved higher grades along the way.
1.9.11.5.1. Con: Homeschooled children have parents who are interested and involved in their education. Even if they were not homeschooled, it is likely that they would still achieve better academic outcomes anyway.
1.9.11.6. Con: Some types of homeschooling encourage pupils to develop their motivation and own approaches to learning, leaving them better equipped for the more independent learning environment of a university
1.9.12. Con: It is harder for homeschooled children to find [friends](http://home-ed.info/home_ed_articles/pros-and-cons-of-home-education).
1.9.12.1. Con: Children are often lonely in school. [drjamesdobson.org](http://drjamesdobson.org/blogs/dr-meeker-blog/dear-dr-meg/2016/06/09/my-child-is-lonely-in-school)
1.9.12.2. Pro: School provides an "[instant community](http://www.aneverydaystory.com/2015/03/04/socialisation-homeschool/)" for children, which is harder to create when necessarily the child sees fewer other children in their day.
1.9.12.2.1. Con: School provides a pool of children, not friends. They also don't provide the opportunity or skills to be friends. Whereas some types of homeschooling encourage children to develop social networks that support their passions and interests.
1.9.12.2.1.1. Con: Many schools throughout the world teach social skills and relationship lessons, both romantic and platonic, as part of their curriculum.
1.9.12.2.1.1.1. Pro: In Britain the [BC curriculum](http://www.bcpeds.ca/uploadfiles/documents/social_skill_tips.pdf) outlines what children are expected to learn at each grade level. This includes goals for social/emotional learning.
1.9.12.2.1.1.2. Pro: The [Social, Personal and Health Education Curriculum](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/Primary/Curriculum-Areas/Social-Personal-and-Health-Education-Curriculum) in Ireland educates children about social interactions.
1.9.12.2.2. Con: Quantity isn't quality. Some children may find it easier to make friends amongst smaller, intentional networks e.g. homeschooling groups aimed at a particular interest.
1.9.12.2.3. Con: Schools are not the only type of intentional learning community. Many homeschoolers undertake a rich variety of social learning activities and are more connected to the daily lives of the community in which they learn e.g. undertaking a shopping trip and knowing the store staff - and indeed participating in formal homeschool groups that enable children to form intentional learning communities e.g. robot club
1.9.12.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.7.
1.9.12.3. Con: Social environments in homeschool tend to be a lot less complex and clique driven than traditional schools.
1.9.12.4. Con: Local support groups allow children to socialize with other children and make new [friends](http://www.outlookacademy.org/support-group/88-benefits-of-a-homeschool-support-group).
1.10. Con: A ban on homeschooling would prioritize state control over individual liberty and would infringe on the most basic freedoms of liberal democracies.
1.10.1. Con: The state has a democratic mandate to ensure the education to a certain standard of its citizens.
1.10.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.
1.10.1.2. Pro: It is difficult and expensive for the state to consistently enforce educational standards for homeschooled children.
1.10.1.2.1. Pro: It is expensive to hire professionals to ensure that children standards are being followed in people's homes.
1.10.1.2.2. Con: It is easy for a state to enforce educational standards. Most states do it now through the usage of standardized tests. States would simply need to ensure that homeschoolers take the tests.
1.10.1.2.3. Con: In the US taxpayers spend an average of $[11,732](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/) per pupil in public schools, plus capital expenditures. Taxpayers spend nothing on most homeschool students.
1.10.1.3. Con: Many parents choose to homeschool because the state has not met the educational standards the state itself has guaranteed.
1.10.1.3.1. Con: Governments should work to achieve a better, inclusive, high-quality and free public education to meet families’ needs, instead of avoiding or outsourcing their responsibility in educating their citizens.
1.10.1.3.1.1. Pro: When parents withdraw their students from the school system, the system suffers from the loss of active and engaged parents who would have otherwise participated in PTA meetings, supported the creation of new curriculum or activities, etc.
1.10.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Forcing children and their parents to improve governments education system is a form of forced labor.
1.10.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Requiring families to stay in a school system that is not working for them means that they are forced to sacrifice their quality of education and personal interests to help solve a problem that they did not even create.
1.10.1.4. Con: A democratic mandate can be used to indoctrinate children into supporting the government or to particular political views.
1.10.1.5. Con: In free societies, family is more important than citizenship, and [socialist governments cannot usurp powers](http://www.reformationboy.com/blog/2018/3/22/do-your-kids-belong-to-the-state) they are not granted.
1.10.1.6. Pro: The political authority has a responsibility to the common good of all citizens. This includes the education of its members, as a well educated younger generation is beneficial for a community.
1.10.2. Pro: Homeschooling keeps students outside the increasingly politicized nature of government education in which political and social agenda often creeps into education material.
1.10.2.1. Pro: By homeschooling, parents can focus on the academic material, free of any whiff of government political indoctrination.
1.10.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.10.2.3. Pro: Totalitarian governments nearly always use the school system to indoctrinate children to follow the state. Homeschool provides a check against this abuse.
1.10.2.3.1. Pro: The Third Reich implemented restrictions on homeschooling in order to expand their influence over children. [\(Martin, p. 228\)](http://arizonajournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7.27.1Martin.pdf)
1.10.2.3.2. Con: The [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling_international_status_and_statistics) of homeschooled children is not high enough to be an effective check on such abuse.
1.10.2.3.2.1. Con: Even if the numbers might not be enough to stop a totalitarian government,it would still preserve freedom of thought and belief for the children who do get it.
1.10.2.3.2.1.1. Con: Countries with large populations of homeschooled children like the US \(2.5 million\), Canada \(60,000\), or the UK \(20,000 to 100,000\) are all liberal [democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling_international_status_and_statistics).
1.10.2.3.2.2. Con: While the current numbers may not be high enough,those numbers would increase if the schools became more biased towards an abusive government.
1.10.2.3.3. Con: -> See 1.10.2.3.2.1.1.
1.10.2.3.4. Pro: China explicitly bans homeschool because it lacks indoctrination into the communist form of government.[breitbart.com](http://www.breitbart.com/education/2017/04/06/china-adopts-policy-officially-condemning-homeschooling/)
1.10.2.4. Con: -> See 1.5.
1.10.3. Pro: Parents should decide about their children's education, not the state.
1.10.3.1. Con: In general, parents do not have the pedagogical or academic knowledge to make informed or effective decisions about their child's education. The professionals employed by the state do.
1.10.3.1.1. Pro: A parent's right to educate their child as they wish is not applicable if they are not aware of what the likely outcomes of a given educational approach are.
1.10.3.1.2. Con: In general, the state does not know a child well enough to make informed or effective decisions about a child’s education. Their parents do.
1.10.3.1.3. Con: Most school do not have the resources to tailor the education of each child based on pedagogy or academic knowledge.
1.10.3.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.3.
1.10.3.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.9.2.1.
1.10.3.1.4. Con: While parents might not have as much academic knowledge as teachers, [67%](https://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/homeschooling-101/reasons-parents-homeschool/) of parents homeschool to provide moral instruction. If that is their goal, they are in a better position to achieve it than teaching professionals.
1.10.3.2. Con: -> See 1.10.1.
1.10.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.
1.10.3.4. Pro: The Supreme Court ruling in the US in 1925 \(["Pierce vs. Society of Sisters"](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/268/510/case.html)\) asserts the State cannot "standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only".
1.10.3.5. Pro: Parents know their children best, and it is this relationship that is the basis for the wide range of decisions that parents are allowed to take on behalf of their children.
1.10.3.6. Pro: If parents are not aligned with their child's school or education, they are unlikely to implement it effectively. It is better to holistically follow one system, than for a child to be confused by contrary instructions at home and school.
1.10.4. Pro: To ban home schooling would say that the state knows better how to make educational decisions than the child's own parents. The government should not have a monopoly on educating the next generation.
1.10.4.1. Pro: It's the parents duty to act in the best interest of the child. Should the parents think that they can provide better education than their local schools they are justified to act accordingly.
1.10.5. Con: The state ought to be more interventionist when it concerns the safety and well-being of children.
1.10.5.1. Pro: Safeguarding the rights of vulnerable groups is a primary function of the state. Given children are the weaker party in the parent-child relationship, the state should closely regulate parental rights.
1.10.5.1.1. Con: Family is the most fundamental and private social organization. “Closely regulating” the family would require government intrusion at unprecedented levels.
1.10.5.1.2. Con: It's true that the safe guarding of rights is the primary function of the state. It's wrong however to use this as a reason for the government to regulate anything. If there exist a reason for the government to intervene in the children’s education, it should be specified before these acts are taken.
1.10.5.2. Con: “More interventionist” does not require a total ban on homeschools.
1.10.5.3. Con: Doing something “for the children” is used as an excuse for many bad policies. More specific reasons should be required.
1.10.5.4. Con: One can argue that by banning homeschooling, you make it harder for parents to be interventionistic. This can be a problem if there are problems at school, such as a teacher who sexually abuses their children, or more commonly, the child is bullied.
1.10.6. Con: Children are citizens with their [own rights](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/child-rights/international-law.php), needs and desires and not their parent’s [property](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15265161.2017.1378768?journalCode=uajb20), thus parents’ authority is not [unlimited](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Parent+and+Child).
1.10.6.1. Con: A child's parents are more likely to have more concern and personal knowledge of their child's unique situation than disinterested government bureaucrats setting policies and curriculum for children in general.
1.10.6.2. Con: -> See 1.5.2.
1.10.6.3. Con: Forced traditional schooling does not necessarily best suit the needs or desires of children either.
1.10.6.3.1. Pro: Some children may prefer to be home schooled. Banning homeschooling would infringe on their rights.
1.10.6.4. Con: This suggests that children are property of the state. Parents know more about the needs and desires of their children than does the state.
1.10.6.5. Con: Children of very young ages can not be expected to make rational decisions in their own self interest, and must rely on their parents.
1.10.7. Pro: Overseeing the raising and education of one's children is a basic human right.
1.10.7.1. Pro: The [US Supreme Court](https://hslda.org/docs/nche/000000/00000075.asp) has consistently made rulings which maintain parental rights, including control of the child's education.
1.10.7.2. Pro: Parents have a moral obligation to act in the best interest of their children. As such, they also have the obligation to extend that right to other parents. As long as they don't infringe on anyone else's rights.
1.10.7.2.1. Pro: Infringement on rights is violence and will likely be met with reciprocal violence. Parents engaged in that behavior don't act in the best interest of their children.
1.11. Con: Homeschooling is economically beneficial.
1.11.1. Con: Given that the type of schooling a child receives is at the heart of their welfare, small economic gains are a minor issue.
1.11.2. Pro: Families can save money through homeschooling.
1.11.2.1. Pro: Homeschooling families save money on expenditures which public schools would otherwise demand.
1.11.2.1.1. Con: The costs of public schools, such as requiring parents purchase certain textbooks, are associated with important educational outcomes. If parents forego these costs, it will impact children's education negatively.
1.11.2.1.2. Con: Most of the costs associated with public schooling are paid through taxes. Homeschooling parents will continue to pay these taxes without availing themselves of the public schools they fund.
1.11.2.1.3. Pro: Homeschooling can be cheaper because its costs are customised.
1.11.2.1.4. Pro: Uniform costs can often be extremely [high](https://www.google.ie/amp/metro.co.uk/2017/09/08/yes-children-need-to-wear-school-uniforms-but-do-they-have-to-be-so-expensive-6912744/amp/).
1.11.2.1.4.1. Con: Just [20%](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=50) of US schools require uniforms.
1.11.2.1.4.2. Pro: A 2015 [report](https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/The-Wrong-Blazer_-_Time-for-action-on-school-uniform-costs_-_The-Children%27s-Commission-on-Poverty_The-Children%27s-Society.pdf) by The Children’s Society in the UK found the cost of a child's uniform at secondary school is on average more than £300 per child annually.
1.11.2.2. Con: Families usually have to forgo a second income in order to homeschool. This removes the income from the family and the production of the second parent in the economy.
1.11.3. Pro: The country where homeschooling is taking place can save a large amount of money.
1.11.3.1. Pro: Families engaged in home-based education are not dependent on public, tax-funded resources for their children’s education.
1.11.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.2.3.
1.11.3.2. Pro: The finances associated with homeschooling represent over [$27 billion](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/) that American taxpayers do not have to spend annually, since these children are not in public schools.
1.11.4. Con: -> See 1.11.2.2.
1.12. Pro: Homeschooling deprives children from a vital socializing environment.
1.12.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.
1.12.2. Con: Traditional/compulsory schooling deprives children of a vital social environment.
1.12.2.1. Pro: Age segregation at a year by year level is unnatural and completely unheard of outside of school environments.
1.12.2.2. Con: -> See 1.5.5.4.2.2.
1.12.3. Con: -> See 1.9.2.
1.12.4. Con: -> See 1.9.3.
1.12.5. Con: [Conventional socialization](https://www.nheri.org/strengthening-the-ties-that-bind/) is not a proper test of success, because homeschooling families seek to resist the influence of peers and the dominant culture.
1.12.6. Pro: In a qualitative [study](http://icher.org/blog/?p=3769) about homeschooling [goals](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03055698.2016.1273763?journalCode=ceds20), education that enhances one’s potential was quoted as a goal for 28 out of 30 respondents; 15 highlighted objectives such as morals, integrity as well as family and religious values and only 13 quoted social goals like “functional life skills” as important.
1.12.6.1. Con: This is an extremely limited sample size to make any conclusions from.
1.12.6.2. Pro: School teaches children how to interact with one another in terms of behavior and consequence not coming from a parental figure, but from people on the same level as them. Hit a friend, you will lose them. Homeschooling doesn't put children out there to experience this.
1.12.6.2.1. Con: Homeschooled children have friends and other social interactions that have consequences, just like this.
1.12.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.7.
1.12.8. Con: "Broad-based assertions by homeschooling’s critics about inferior academic or social outcomes are not justified" \([paragraph 4](http://icher.org/icher.html)\).
1.12.8.1. Con: Similarly, "the research base on academic achievement \(measured primarily via standardized testing\) and socialization relies on small-scale and/or non-randomized samples" therefore "claims that the 'average homeschooler' outperforms public school students is simply not substantiated by the [data](http://icher.org/icher.html)".
1.12.9. Pro: -> See 1.9.11.
1.12.10. Pro: -> See 1.9.12.
1.12.11. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.12.12. Con: Socialisation should be a requirement of homeschooling but this can be achieved in ways other than banning homeschooling outright. For example, adequate socialisation being included within assessment requirements.
1.12.13. Con: Home schooled children benefit from their parents mobility in [social spaces](http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100515480). This means that when conflict occurs, parents can distance their children from the impacts. This is not a option for traditional school's where children can be victimized through bullying.
1.12.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.
1.13. Pro: Homeschooling can interfere with healthy family relationships.
1.13.1. Pro: Homeschooled children may create a co-dependent relationship with their parents.
1.13.1.1. Pro: Parents who wish to have greater control over their children's lives are also more likely to be [codependent parents](https://www.recoveryranch.com/articles/codependent-parenting-nurturing-enabling/), who 'over-parent' their children.
