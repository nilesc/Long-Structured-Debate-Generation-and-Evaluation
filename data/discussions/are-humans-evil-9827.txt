Discussion Title: Are Humans Evil?

1. Humans are evil
1.1. Pro: Humans kill other humans.
1.1.1. Pro: After mosquitoes, humans are the second cause of humans' deaths. [www.telegraph.co.uk](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/03/15/which-animal-kills-the-most-humans/)
1.2. Con: There is no such essence in human being. Everything in our behaviour and way of judging is socially constructed.
1.2.1. Pro: Evil is a subjective social concept created by humans, not an inherent property of humans
1.3. Pro: Human's are capable of understanding consequences of actions and yet do them anyway, the ability to do that in a species qualifies as evil.
1.3.1. Con: Not necessarily, because going against a consequence can be for a good intention. The resulted situation can be judged.
1.4. Con: There is no objective morality, so humans cannot be evil.
1.4.1. Pro: This is clearly seen in the differences in moral perspectives across the globe. Even if there were an objective morality, human beings themselves are far too complex and diverse on fundamental levels that it would be impossible to say all humans are evil or humans as a whole are evil.
1.4.2. Con: Objective morality exists within cultures. Certain especially immoral actions are almost universally seen as cruel across all human cultures \(torture for fun\) and thus nearly all humans.
1.5. Pro: Humans do what's in their best interests even if it's bad.
1.5.1. Con: Humans often act out of kindness and love.
1.5.2. Con: Humans do what they think is in their self-interest. Humans think that acts which are judged to be morally good are in their self-interest. Therefore, humans both act in their own self-interest, and act for the good.
1.5.2.1. Con: Moral acts are only beneficial if others observe the act. If someone believes that they can get away with an immoral act, they are likely to do it.
1.5.3. Con: In modern developed society human interests are generally served best by being more good than evil, due to punishments for evil acts.
1.5.3.1. Con: There is an argument that even the greatest forms of altruism are an attempt to secure a reciprocal benefit for ourselves in the future, thus making them self-interested.
1.5.4. Con: Some people can act and appear as "bad" even if he/she is in good faith.
1.5.5. Pro: A starving person will steal food in order to survive.
1.5.5.1. Con: A person doing what they feel they need to in order to protect themselves or survive isn't coming from a place of wanting to inflict harm on another, but simply to stay alive.
1.5.6. Pro: A person concerned for their life will kill if it's in their power if that means living another a day.
1.5.6.1. Con: That is self defense, not necessarily evil.
1.5.7. Con: [Studies](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-probe-human-nature-and-discover-we-are-good-after-all/) have found that most human impulses are selfless, benefiting others before ourselves.
1.5.7.1. Con: Benefiting ourselves or others does not imply a positive moral outcome.
1.5.7.1.1. Con: This is besides the point. Being driven by the well-being of others above your own is not what most people would call 'evil'.
1.6. Con: Nobody is born evil.
1.6.1. Con: Even if no one was born evil, that does not imply that all are born good, as people may be born neutral.
1.6.1.1. Con: This is besides the point: it doesn't inform the debate on whether humans are evil, rather, it simply re-states that they can be born in a myriad of other ways.
1.6.2. Pro: The notion that all humans are 'evil' has its origins in belief systems that have recourse to magical thinking. It simply does not stand up to scientific scrutiny. [Empirical evidence](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/out-the-darkness/201308/the-real-meaning-good-and-evil) shows that behaviours dubbed 'evil' are a product of nurture, not nature. To suggest otherwise is to fly in the face of all reliable evidence.
1.6.3. Con: Humans are born prone to certain personality traits due to their genetic makeup it just takes time for the traits to surface. Humans can become good or evil over time.
1.6.4. Pro: Evil is a choice.
1.6.4.1. Con: Good is also a choice, the mere presence of a choice does not make the one who chooses inherently good.
1.6.4.2. Pro: One can become evil in subjective way due to his background, morals, beliefs, experiences. Thus being a choice in the end.
1.6.4.3. Pro: Humans have free will and therefore can choose to behave in an evil way, or not. This indicates that evil is not a pre-existing trait, but one that can expressed freely.
1.6.5. Pro: Infants and young children do not naturally exhibit evil behaviors. Any violence or seemingly evil acts are a product of their environment and teachings.
1.6.5.1. Con: Infants and young children do things that, on a larger scale, we would consider evil if done by an adult. For example, stealing a toy or hitting another child--the adult analogues to these \(theft and battery\) we do consider evil.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: Children have the instinct of hurting and being mean to other people whilst growing up we "behave" in order to be socially acceptable.
1.6.5.2. Con: You don't have to teach your child how to misbehave.
1.6.5.3. Pro: [Research](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/11/001106061128.htm) shows violence is a learned behavior.
1.6.5.4. Pro: Children naturally help each other.
1.6.5.4.1. Con: Children naturally fight each other as an internal need for survival, but bond with one another because you also need others to survive.
1.6.5.4.2. Con: They also bully each other as well due to lack of empathy and human experience.
1.6.6. Pro: Humans are inherently neutral.
1.6.6.1. Pro: Good or evil behaviors are cultivated by our parents or surroundings. Our slate is neutral at birth.
1.6.6.1.1. Con: We are born with personality traits simply because babies cannot express those traits clearly at birth does not mean they aren't present.
1.6.6.1.1.1. Pro: Many personality traits are innate due to physiology.
1.6.6.1.2. Con: Good is a cultural construct used by religious institutions.
1.6.6.1.2.1. Con: Good and bad still exists outside of religious authority.
1.6.6.2. Con: There is no neutral stance to morality.
1.6.6.3. Con: What is seen as neutral is often just opportunism.
1.6.6.3.1. Pro: People considered neutral generally do what suits their best interests even if that means ignoring unjust actions. They choose sides based on whether or not it will benefit them not on whether or not it's the right thing to do.
1.7. Pro: Humanity has been at constant war from its existence.
1.7.1. Con: Wars can start out of the best intention, no one going to war will say they are doing it for evil reasons.
1.8. Con: Human brains are hardwired for[empathy](https://news.virginia.edu/content/human-brains-are-hardwired-empathy-friendship-study-shows).
1.8.1. Con: Empathy can be weaponized to know precisely how to hurt someone.
1.8.2. Con: Humans also naturally feel envy and schadenfreude.
1.8.2.1. Con: Envy is a [survival response](https://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/files/2015/09/evolution-of-envy.pdf) seen in both humans and animals, not an ingrained evil.
1.8.3. Con: Psychopaths do not have empathy and cannot process oxytocin like Neurotypicals. This due to their unique brain variant which is clearly not hardwired for empathy.

[medicaldaily.com](http://www.medicaldaily.com/psychopaths-feel-no-empathy-others-how-do-their-brains-differ-257752)
1.8.3.1. Con: Psychopaths only make up 0.75%-1% of human beings.
[livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/7859-psychopath-answers-remain-elusive.html)
1.8.4. Con: Humans are hardwired to be empathetic towards certain people, but not all. One would not be as empathetic towards a stranger as they would be with a loved one.
1.8.5. Con: Sociopaths have impaired senses of empathy due to abuse.[medicaldaily.com](http://www.medicaldaily.com/whats-difference-between-sociopath-and-psychopath-not-much-one-might-kill-you-270694)
1.8.5.1. Con: Sociopaths only make up 3% of human beings and are hardly representative of the whole.[eyesofasociopath.weebly.com](https://eyesofasociopath.weebly.com/statistics.html)
1.8.6. Con: Hardwired does not necessitate the absolute expression of this characteristic, as empathy can also be [learned](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/out-the-darkness/201203/empathy-the-ability-makes-us-truly-human) to some degree.
1.8.7. Pro: [Studies](http://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/8980/20130822/scientists-reveal-human-brains-hardwired-empathy-friendship.htm) have found that when together, a person under threat and a friend viewing this threat can both experience neurological response during the attack. This indicates there is a connection allowing us to empathize with the suffering of another.
1.8.8. Pro: Sadists actually have more empathy that the average person which makes them more effective.[healthland.time.com](http://healthland.time.com/2012/05/14/understanding-the-psychopathic-mind/)
1.8.8.1. Pro: "When viewing the pictures of pain, the sadists showed greater activation in their amygdala — a brain area associated with strong emotion — compared with the other sexual offenders. Moreover, the sadists rated the pain experienced by the victim as more intense than the nonsadists did. And the more intense the sadists thought the pain was, the greater their activation in another brain region called the insula, which is involved with monitoring one’s own feelings and body states."
1.8.9. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.4.
1.9. Pro: Many humans are sadists and feel pleasure in putting others in pain, hence they're not inherently good.
1.9.1. Pro: [The Intrinsic Appeal of Evil: Sadism, Sensational Thrills, and Threatened Egotism](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327957pspr0303_4) discusses how sadism can take place out of boredom and to protect threatened egos. Online games are a great place to observe this type of behavior.
1.9.2. Con: Not being good does not imply being bad/evil.
1.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.6.
1.9.3. Con: The fact that some people enjoy inflicting pain on others does not necessitate the conclusion that humans are not inherently good. That this is a pleasure some might enjoy does not mean they actually intentionally inflict that pain. We should not judge someone solely by a desire if they never act or intend to act upon it.
1.9.3.1. Pro: It is a small exception compared to the whole number of people that make up our race. It is not a trait of our species.
1.9.4. Con: Some people like inflicting pain on others, but there also people who enjoy having a certain degree of pain inflicted upon them. If "sadists" limit their infliction to these contexts, they make a choice of being good. The infliction, not the desire of pain, makes one bad.
1.9.4.1. Con: Those are called Masochists and sadists watching people enjoy the pain that they're in might limit their enjoyment.
1.9.4.1.1. Pro: Some sadists get off by their victims by the emotional pain that their victims experience not just the physical.
1.9.4.1.1.1. Pro: This arousal is purely preferential.
1.9.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Some sadists don't care and just like to see damaged inflicted on the person's body.
1.9.4.1.2. Con: This limits the number of people who practice/would prefer to practice "bad sadism," then, further supporting the point that the existence of such people does not necessitate the conclusion that humans are evil.
1.9.4.1.3. Con: Some sadists don't mind as long as they're sure they're inflicting pain.
1.9.5. Pro: In the Milgram experiment, humans knowingly tortured other humans[simplypsychology.org](https://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html)
1.9.6. Pro: A [study](https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/how-common-are-sadists#page-2) found that everyday sadism is more common than previously thought by researchers, potentially manifesting more commonly online.
1.10. Con: Humans crave love.
1.10.1. Con: Human's may crave love, but that craving may lead them to try to force others to love them, which is evil. Thus, the craving of love in and of itself says nothing as to whether human's are inherently good.
1.10.1.1. Pro: It is possible for humans to crave love because their inherent evilness doesn't allow them to experience it on a daily basis. Therefore, it creates a feeling of wanting to experience it.
1.10.2. Pro: A human's craving for love shows that they have good intentions and desires.
1.10.2.1. Con: Humans may act in a bad/evil way to get that love.
1.10.2.1.1. Pro: The way in which they try to obtain that love is a result of lack of knowledge/cultural influence.
1.10.3. Con: Humans crave love *for themselves*, and not necessarily for others.
1.10.3.1. Con: Craving love for oneself may be considered selfish, but selfishness does not imply evilness.
1.10.4. Con: Just because we crave love does not mean we are love.
1.10.5. Con: Humans may do evil deeds in the name of love.
1.10.6. Pro: The [need for love](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/enlightened-living/200902/primal-wiring-survival-and-the-need-be-loved) is a necessary innate mechanism for the purpose of human survival.
1.10.6.1. Pro: Human survival is good, therefore love is good and since humans crave love they must be good too.
1.10.7. Con: Some humans cannot bond or love such as those with Anti Social Personality Disorder.[psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder)
1.10.7.1. Con: Even humans with anti social personality disorder are capable of love, the fact that some [treatment](https://psychcentral.com/disorders/antisocial-personality-disorder/treatment/) exist proves that. It is not because they don't love now that they will never love or that they never loved.
1.10.8. Con: [Research](https://www.livescience.com/2231-humans-crave-violence-sex.html) on the brains of mice, thought to be analogous with the human brain, has shown humans may crave violence in the same way we food, sex, or drugs.
1.11. Pro: Humans enjoy violence.
1.11.1. Con: Violence can be done for Good or Evil.  Violence against someone attacking your family could be considered a Good act.
1.11.2. Pro: [Ninety-nine percent](https://www.aafp.org/about/policies/all/violence-media.html) of movies contain violence, yet people enjoy seeing these movies.
1.11.2.1. Con: While a majority may enjoy violence on a fictional level, crime levels and conflict levels tend to demonstrate that we're generally not at all that fond to do it in "real life".
1.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.8.
1.11.4. Con: Humans also enjoy romance.
1.12. Con: Evil is just a judgment.
1.12.1. Con: Evil is a linguistic construct we created to describe attributes we dislike in other humans. An action can only be described as evil when a human does it.
1.12.1.1. Pro: For example, lions committing infanticide are not evil but acting on instinct. A human committing the same act would be, so by definition, only humans are evil.
1.12.2. Pro: One man's evil is another man's good.  It is a matter of perspective.
1.12.2.1. Pro: The definition of evil is subjective: where one sees evil, others can see good. Although some actions are purely based of our own interests, surviving itself is in our nature. This is also true for other organisms. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-preservation)
1.12.3. Pro: If there is no fear, there is no judgment.
1.12.3.1. Con: Judgment is required for justice. It not only exists but is morally important
1.12.4. Pro: Humans are not evil but they often act evil. [Most evil comes from the distinction between US and THEM.](https://youtu.be/qZ-hkpqVlYw) Inside their own groups \(e.g. family, nation, religion or even species\) humans act more with compassion and love.
1.12.5. Con: Psychopaths do not have fear and they judge people all the time.
1.12.5.1. Con: Psychopaths [do feel fear](https://www.forensicmag.com/article/2016/09/psychopaths-feel-fear-not-danger), they just lack the judgement of danger therefore being perceived as lacking any fear.
1.12.6. Con: There are things that are universally evil that people do regardless whether or not it's good or bad in order to further their own aims.
