1.5.1. Con: Yet one person can set an example and inspire others.
1.6. Pro: Plastics are exported and, therefore, less plastic reduces emissions that result from transportation.
1.6.1. Pro: Global plastic production is fairly focused on Asia with about 50% being produced there \([p.17](https://www.plasticseurope.org/application/files/5715/1717/4180/Plastics_the_facts_2017_FINAL_for_website_one_page.pdf)\)
1.6.2. Pro: China exported [$17.9 billion](http://www.worldstopexports.com/plastic-item-exports-country/) worth of plastic items in 2017.
