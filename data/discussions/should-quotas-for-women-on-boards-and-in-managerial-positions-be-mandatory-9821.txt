Discussion Title: Should quotas for women on boards and in managerial positions be mandatory?

1. Quotas for women on boards and in managerial positions should be mandatory.
1.1. Pro: Having women in senior positions improves the financial performance of firms.
1.1.1. Con: If having women in senior positions by itself improves the financial performance of firms, quotas would be unnecessary.
1.1.1.1. Pro: If diversity is good for business, companies will recognise that and put more women on boards without the need for quotas.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: If there was truly a correlation between higher percentage of women in senior leadership roles and financial performance, they would be there in greater numbers. The board of directors of a publicly traded company has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the shareholders.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Research suggests that simply placing additional women in management/ board positions is [insufficient](https://hbr.org/2013/09/women-rising-the-unseen-barriers) to creating meaningful change. The women have to be empowered to self-identify, and be seen by others in the business, as leaders in order for cultural shift to permeate the business and its employees.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: These [findings](https://hbr.org/2013/09/women-rising-the-unseen-barriers) may help explain why some businesses thrive when they diversify their management structures, yet others stagnate. If placing women in these structures is the only change a company implements, the underlying culture of the company remains oppositional to female empowerment, whereas companies that promote women as part of changing culture experience more benefit from these promotions.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: In many countries, notably led by Norway's radical quota policy, the [pace](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/03/economist-explains-14) of natural change is simply too slow to allow diversity progress without state intervention.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: One reason for this may be that most people do not consciously devalue female candidates, but subconsciously selection panels [prefer](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/03/economist-explains-14) male candidates over equally qualified female candidates.
1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Even if the [current pace of change](http://fortune.com/2017/02/06/board-diversity-fortune-500/) is maintained, it will take a decade for women to occupy 40% of the board seats in Fortune 500 countries. And that relies on the current pace of change being maintained year on year for that decade.
1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: In a climate of increasing awareness of the unique difficulties faced by women in the workplace, epitomised by the [Me Too Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Too_movement), it is likely that the pace of change will remain the same, if not grow quicker.
1.1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: The 'Me Too Movement' has primarily addressed the issue of sexual misconduct in the workplace, not the lack of gender equality in leadership positions. Therefore, there is no direct evidence to suggest that the movement will hasten the process of seeing more women on boards and managerial positions in the workplace.
1.1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: A decade is not a long time to wait, especially if the introduction of quotas could permanently change the way in which the contribution of women is valued once they reach board positions for the worse.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: Quotas are proving vastly [more effective](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21737079-gender-quotas-board-level-europe-have-done-little-boost-corporate-performance-or) in shifting the behaviour of companies than decades of sociocultural shift/ progression were.
1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The article also mentions Great Britain, who did not have mandatory quotas but [had a similar increase in women board members](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/images/print-edition/20180217_WBC764.png) as Italy, Germany, and Netherlands, who had mandatory quotas.
1.1.1.1.3.2. Con: The article says the gender pay gap shrunk for the women who filled the quotas, but that there was no discernible beneficial effect on women at lower levels of the corporate hierarchy.
1.1.1.1.4. Con: CEOs of companies say that they support diversity in the workplace, but only [45%](http://graphics.wsj.com/how-men-and-women-see-the-workplace-differently/) of their employees think their company is doing the work that is necessary to achieve gender parity.
1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Opinions are subject to a number of biases including social conformity bias and popularity bias, so the opinion of employees who are not privy to the internal decision making process of executives is not a credible indicator of executive performance.
1.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: Although women and men are represented equally at the entry level and lobby for promotions at the same rate, women are [less likely](http://graphics.wsj.com/how-men-and-women-see-the-workplace-differently/) to get those promotions. Making quotas for women on boards and managerial positions mandatory will ensure that CEOs of companies follow through on their commitment to having more women in leadership roles.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1. Con: Numerous other factors can explain why fewer women get promotions besides gender discrimination.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Women may choose to not accept promotions because of demanding family commitments. A [survey](http://www.thejournal.ie/gender-discrimination-promotions-819524-Mar2013/) by Microsoft found that 28 per cent of the women interviewed said that prioritizing of home life was the most significant obstacle to promotion.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Women spend more than double the amount of time men spend on unpaid labour such as household chores. The societal expectation that women will spend more time on [unpaid domestic labour](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/02/the-scourge-of-the-female-time-crunch/470379/) than men is simply another form of gender discrimination.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Young girls are socialised to see themselves as caregivers and to hold family and housekeeping values. From very early years young girls are prepared for their unpaid labour as adults, spending [40%](http://www.medicaldaily.com/chores-around-world-girls-spend-40-more-time-boys-cooking-cleaning-caring-400671) more time than their male counterparts on chores daily.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: It is not men who are sexist when choosing between male and female candidates. It is a deeper cultural bias towards hiring men over women. Research shows that [women share these biases](http://ideas.time.com/2012/10/04/womens-inhumanity-to-women/) against their female peers when they are involved in hiring practices.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: [Numerous studies](http://ideas.time.com/2012/10/04/womens-inhumanity-to-women/) have shown that when gender-blind selection occurs, more female candidates are selected, but when gender is known to the selectors, they \(male or female\) are biased towards female candidates. This suggests the issue is a deep-rooted sociocultural bias that will not be solved by introducing quotas.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: This kind of bias is a [product](http://ideas.time.com/2012/10/04/womens-inhumanity-to-women/) of sexism in our society and culture and can be aided with technology \(which will not share human gender bias unless programmed to do so\) or by raising awareness of people's gender biases, but not by quotas.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Quotas will increase the visibility of women in management, with ripple effects for perception of women in leadership in contemporary culture. Quotas also increase the likelihood of encountering a women on a board, or in management, and being confronted with one's biases towards women in these roles. In these ways, quotas can play a role in reducing these biases over time.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1.3. Con: When hiring, or promoting, selectors tend to choose [the candidate most like them](https://hbr.org/2013/09/women-rising-the-unseen-barriers), meaning that male-dominated companies often identify more with male behaviours, and candidates, and thus perpetuate male dominated management structures.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.2.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.2.1.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.2.1.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1.5. Con: The government's [Equal Opportunities Act](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/362510/Equal_Opportunities_Policy_Statement_GOVUK.pdf) clearly states that "all employees have a fair and equal chance of developing their abilities and realising their expectations and to make full and effective use of their potential." A [study](http://graphics.wsj.com/how-men-and-women-see-the-workplace-differently/) demonstrated that firms have afforded fewer development opportunities to women in contrast to men. This unfairly hinders the prospects of women for promotion thus necessitating governmental intervention.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1.5.1. Pro: The government making quotas for women in leadership roles mandatory ensures that women are not disadvantaged by the lack of development opportunities for women in workplaces.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1.5.1.1. Con: Quotas can lead to discrimination against members of the excluded group. If there are more qualified men than women for example, then a typical man will be discriminated against by a quota for women.
1.1.1.1.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.1.1.4.2.3. Pro: Research has shown that while men are often promoted on the [basis of their 'potential'](https://fairygodboss.com/articles/gender-equality-in-the-workplace-we-are-not-there-yet), women are less likely to be promoted on this basis, instead they are promoted for good performance. This difference may cause a delay for women in moving up a corporate ladder compared to their male peers.
1.1.1.2. Con: The lack of representation for women on boards and in management is the result of discrimination / bias and not rational decision making in the best interest of the organization.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.3.
1.1.2. Pro: Diversity is an asset to businesses, and having women in senior positions allows them to bring a unique perspective.
1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.1.2.2. Con: Diversity being an asset to a business is only one school of thought. An opposing one is that it is better to have a group of like minded individuals with natural similarities and common interests, as they will work better as a team and be able to communicate better.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Companies that have experimented with diversifying by attracting more female employees have found that their output and employee [quality was not harmed](https://hbr.org/2013/09/women-rising-the-unseen-barriers) by increasing the diversity on their team of workers.
1.1.2.3. Pro: A [report](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters) found that gender-diverse companies are 15% more likely to have better financial returns above their respective national industry medians.
1.1.2.4. Pro: While only a fraction of the half of people which make up society are selected to run businesses, a large amount of potential talent goes ignored and under-utilised. It makes sense that fostering and including this talent would improve the performances of businesses.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: One study estimated that male dominated boards cost the global economy [$655 billion.](http://time.com/4053907/female-board-members/)
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: One example, Beam, [lost out](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/lack-diversity-business-leaders-limit-innovation) on over $50 million by failing to see the potential in a product aimed at the female market until after the product had already proven its success.
1.1.2.5. Con: Diversity in gender does not necessarily mean diversity in perspectives.
1.1.2.5.1. Con: Equal representation is more likely to lead to diversity in perspectives than the massively unequal representation currently experienced.
1.1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Managers and board members have been [unable to see value](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/lack-diversity-business-leaders-limit-innovation) in ideas that do not relate to them, an issue that costs their businesses given boards are dominated by white men, meaning they are often out of touch with ideas that serve female and non-white consumers.
1.1.2.5.2. Con: For most businesses the consumers of the company's products or services are not solely male, yet having only, or mostly, male voices at managerial level and on their company board can cost a company, when they cannot see issues from the [perspective](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/03/economist-explains-14) of many of their consumers.
1.1.2.5.2.1. Pro: This effect is [documented](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/lack-diversity-business-leaders-limit-innovation) to have led businesses to miss out on opportunities that were proposed to them, or to have created hostile environments where women or minority members did not feel comfortable highlighting areas of missed opportunity or bringing forward innovative ideas.
1.1.2.5.2.1.1. Pro: Women and minorities have been found to be more likely to [create 'speak up culture'](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/lack-diversity-business-leaders-limit-innovation) as managers than their white male counterparts. It is this culture that is linked to innovation in ideas and valuing new consumer bases.
1.1.2.5.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.
1.1.2.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.1.1.
1.1.2.5.2.3. Con: This claim doesn't address the assertion above it at all.

The core assertion isn't whether or not firms *could benefit from* having more women on their boards, but whether or not they should be *obliged by law*.
1.1.2.5.3. Pro: Many women in the business sphere may come from the same type of background in terms of race and class, and be similarly educated, which means they may not bring particularly diverse perspectives.
1.1.2.6. Pro: A survey by [RSA](https://thersagroup.com/rsa_views/glass-ceiling-addressing-the-boardroom-gender-gap/), an executive search firm, found that "women bring empathy and intuition to leadership" with three quarters \(75 percent\) of managers rating women higher than men for intuition \(people awareness and focus\) and empathy \(insight into how decisions play out in the wider organisation\). Nearly two-thirds of respondents \(62 per cent\) thought that women contribute differently in the boardroom as compared to their male colleagues.
1.1.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.2.
1.1.2.8. Con: Diversity is a consideration that is unrelated or neutral to the fundamental aims of business; the idea that it is an inherent asset to business is not strictly true in any causal sense. It is a manifestation of a particular group of broader beliefs in which equality of outcome is a goal in itself.
1.1.2.9. Pro: Companies that have [gender-diverse](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/J6az76rHkCE8jkJm0VYUnJ/Why-companies-should-recruit-more-women.html) teams have higher sales and profits compared to male-dominated teams.
1.1.2.9.1. Con: Nothing in the cited article supports this claim.
1.1.3. Pro: A [Catalyst study](http://www.catalyst.org/media/companies-more-women-board-directors-experience-higher-financial-performance-according-latest) of Fortune 500 companies found that those with the highest percentage of women board directors outperformed those with the least by 53%.
1.1.3.1. Con: Correlation does not equal causation. It may be instead that the best performing companies are places where it is [easier to focus](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21737079-gender-quotas-board-level-europe-have-done-little-boost-corporate-performance-or) on diverse hiring and promotional practices, rather than the diversity causing the high performance.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Studies that look at performance before and after quotas are introduced [have not shown](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21737079-gender-quotas-board-level-europe-have-done-little-boost-corporate-performance-or) conclusive results linking performance improvement to the presence of gender balance in managerial positions.
1.1.4. Pro: According to a [study](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/08/female-executives-global-study-gender-diversity-workplace), companies with more women in senior executive roles "demonstrated repeatedly" a boost in profits.
1.1.4.1. Con: Correlation does not mean causation. Just because more women on boards correlated with improved financial performances does not mean that they had a direct causal link.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: [Jack Ma](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/308021?) recently spoke on this as his firm Alibaba is one firm benefiting from this effect. His point was that he values more "feminine" virtues like high EQ, and thus happens to hire more women who demonstrate them. The financial improvements that come with women in senior positions seem better explained by company culture.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.4.2. Con: The study cited states flatly that "empirical evidence on these issues is mixed" and goes on to illustrate why.

[piie.com](https://piie.com/publications/wp/wp16-3.pdf)
1.1.4.3. Con: Only because a company can hire the best woman doesn't mean woman at all are better for the profit of a company. Women tend to take similar roles to men when they take higher positions. In this article from the [economist](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21737079-gender-quotas-board-level-europe-have-done-little-boost-corporate-performance-or) it is shown that even in the most equal countries women tend to do little to boost profits.
1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.3. Pro: Businesses, and our work life, are a major part of our lives. Therefore we should consider how to grow equality in the workplace, in a range of ways in order to contribute to a larger shift in society.
1.3.1. Con: This claim doesn't answer the topic's question: there are other ways to genuinely achieve equality than mandatory quotas.
1.3.1.1. Pro: There are alternatives to the legislated quota system that have lesser harms and can help achieve gender equality in the workplace.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: One option is to introduce [targets](http://www.computerweekly.com/blog/WITsend/Is-there-an-alternative-to-female-quotas-for-management-boards), as opposed to quotas. These targets would highlight a lack of diversity at board level and encourage organisations to boost gender equality. By putting the lack of women at board level in the spotlight, the issue would become unavoidable and businesses would have to tackle their diversity issues head on.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Such an initiative would encourage businesses to train women for the boardroom from the beginning of their careers. Women can then rise to the top of their businesses based on their own merit, and not their gender.
1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: This option of gender targets has been used as an alternative to quotas in a number of places, and countries, for example [Ontario](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ontario-wants-at-least-40-per-cent-women-on-provincial-boards-by2019/article30327193/) and [Brazil](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ontario-wants-at-least-40-per-cent-women-on-provincial-boards-by2019/article30327193/).
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: One approach to address the disproportionality on corporate boards is the adoption of a “[comply or explain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comply_or_explain)” governance system which requires companies to address the issue of proportionate gender representation with regards to board and executive appointments in their company filings and other reports and to explain the reason for any failure to comply with particular gender guidelines set out by government regulators.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: In the United Kingdom, the UK Corporate Governance Code contains a mandatory “comply or explain” measure designed to address gender disproportionality on corporate boards. The [UK Corporate Governance Code](https://www.frc.org.uk/getattachment/e322c20a-1181-4ac8-a3d3-1fcfbcea7914/UK-Corporate-Governance-Code-\(September-2012\).pdf) allows corporate boards to implement their own gender diversity policies and explicitly requires merit to be a consideration in candidate selection. \(pg.15\)
1.3.1.1.3. Con: Men will always exhibit stereotypical attitudes towards women in the workplace, which prevents them from having an equal opportunity for promotion to leadership roles. A legislated quota system is the only way to circumvent this hurdle.
1.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: Women who demonstrate [assertiveness](http://www.catalyst.org/media/damned-or-doomed-catalyst-study-gender-stereotyping-work-uncovers-double-bind-dilemmas-women) in leadership roles are are seen as competent but disliked.
1.3.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Recent research demonstrated that employees, who had experiences of women in leadership roles, [rated](https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/03/are-successful-women-really-less-likable-than-successful-men/273926/) them favourably. An increase in women occupying managerial roles will only help break the stereotype that male managers are better.
1.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: Women in leadership roles are judged to a higher standard than males and are rewarded with less. Women have to work twice as hard as men for the same level of work often having to ['prove'](http://www.catalyst.org/media/damned-or-doomed-catalyst-study-gender-stereotyping-work-uncovers-double-bind-dilemmas-women) that they can lead.
1.3.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Female leaders are [perceived](http://www.catalyst.org/media/damned-or-doomed-catalyst-study-gender-stereotyping-work-uncovers-double-bind-dilemmas-women) as “never just right.” If female business leaders act consistent with gender stereotypes, they are considered too soft. If they go against gender stereotypes, they are considered too tough.
1.3.1.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.3.2.1.
1.3.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.5.1.
1.3.1.1.5. Con: Women have been shown in studies to fulfill the primary objective of businesses, which is to boost their financial performance. The fact that women are still grossly[under-represented](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-mather/dear-white-men-seven-piec_b_7899084.html) in leadership roles in light of this fact, means that legislated quotas are the only way to incentivize businesses to ensure gender parity in the workplace.
1.3.1.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.3.1.1.6. Con: [Three-quarters](https://www.economist.com/node/21549953) of people across Europe say they are in favor of laws to ensure gender balanced boards. Rejecting a legislated quota system would therefore be undemocratic.
1.3.1.1.7. Pro: An alternative to quotas is to ensure companies commit to a ["positive action"](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8177872/Britain-embraces-positive-action-to-abolish-workplace-discrimination.html) system in recruitment and promotion processes when faced with two or more candidates of equal merit, to address under-representation of women in the workforce. This alternative will ensure women are not disadvantaged with regards to promotion to leadership roles. Companies that fail to promote a fairer deal for women could be "named and shamed".
1.3.1.1.7.1. Pro: Reputation is important for any business to thrive and prosper. The potential for being "named and shamed" for continuing to perpetuate the [gender pay gap](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8177872/Britain-embraces-positive-action-to-abolish-workplace-discrimination.html), or not resolving the disparity that exists between men and women in leadership roles, will ensure that businesses operate in a way that does not unfairly disadvantage women without the need for gender quotas.
1.3.2. Pro: Gender imbalances result in ineffective product design, Apple famously failed to include a period tracker in their HealthKit product \([Healthkit Failure](https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6844021/apple-promised-an-expansive-health-app-so-why-cant-i-track)\). This was a feature at least half the population would consider *obvious* but the male majority design team overlooked.
1.3.2.1. Con: This only shows women may be better at designing products and features targeted to other women.

This is actually an argument FOR gender imbalances since you'd rather have more women on teams designing female products and more men on teams designing male products.
1.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.2.
1.3.3. Con: There is a big difference between equal opportunity and equal outcome. Equal opportunity should be encouraged with work positions being given on individual merit. Equal outcome becomes forced giving people the position to meet a quota rather than on their full ability.
1.3.3.1. Con: This is an ideal. This ideal would work well in the absence of specific prevalent biases that affect underrepresented people. By itself, it does nothing to address the bias.
1.3.3.2. Con: Women are being denied equal opportunities in the workplace necessitating the need for quotas.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.5.
1.3.4. Pro: Reinforcing the importance of equality in the workplace by putting policies in place to ensure people are treated fairly regardless of who they are, sends an important message to staff which may be carried over into their lives outside the workplace.
1.3.4.1. Con: Quotas aren't fair in that they do not drive selection of candidates based on competency or accomplishment.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: People should earn managerial or board positions on the basis of merit, rather than being selected because of their gender.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: Being in a managerial or board position is not an entitlement just because one is a woman.
1.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: A [study](https://www.forbes.com/sites/datafreaks/2014/10/16/gender-quotas-in-hiring-drive-away-both-women-and-men/#1e5c3c312350) has found that gender quotas are unattractive to women because they negate the importance of merit, driving away top talent.
1.3.4.1.1.3. Pro: Our society should have equal opportunities when it comes to education and work, irrespective of people's race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc. Mandatory quotas on women disadvantage men. Having mandatory quotas on women is the same as the [Numerus Clausus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_quota) in Nazi Germany, which is almost universally condemned.
1.3.4.1.1.3.1. Con: Women are not currently given equal opportunities in the work place.
1.3.4.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Sexist assumptions mean that the merit of female candidates is not acknowledged appropriately in the status quo.
1.3.4.1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Research has shown that the high quality work of female employees is [more likely](https://fairygodboss.com/articles/gender-equality-in-the-workplace-we-are-not-there-yet) \(than the work of male employees\) to be attributed to 'good team effort' rather than to the work of the woman herself.
1.3.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.9.
1.3.4.1.1.3.1.2. Con: If you feel like you're not given equal opportunities at a workspace you can sue them.
1.3.4.1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Equal opportunity legislation is very difficult to enforce. It is very difficult to prove that a panel of selectors chose a male candidate over a female candidate due to bias, rather than because they were placing more value on certain experience or qualifications that the male candidate had, than those of the female candidate.
1.3.4.1.1.3.1.3. Con: Women are given equal opportunities in law. The law is fine, the problem is that it might not be enforced well enough. The solution to this problem should be better enforcement instead of modifying the law to favor women.
1.3.4.1.1.3.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.3.1.2.1.
1.3.4.1.1.3.1.4. Pro: Many women suffer gender discrimination in their work lives. However, many women are unable, or unwilling to pinpoint these experiences, a phenomenon known as '[second generation gender bias](https://hbr.org/2013/09/women-rising-the-unseen-barriers)'.
1.3.4.1.1.3.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.3.
1.3.4.1.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.
1.3.4.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.3.1.1.
1.3.4.1.1.5. Con: Individuals are not selected for managerial or board positions on the basis of merit in the status quo.
1.3.4.1.1.5.1. Pro: The world's largest companies mishired people 80% of the time and mispromoted people 75% of the time according to a [study from 2005.](http://www.davidclutterbuckpartnership.com/wp-content/uploads/Critical-Conversations-in-succession-Planning.pdf)
1.3.4.1.1.5.1.1. Con: The statistic here seems to be a reference to [the following 1999 book,](https://www.amazon.com/Topgrading-Leading-Companies-Coaching-Keeping/dp/0735200491) which suggests both outdated statistics and inaccurately cited claims on part of the original source listed in the above argument.
1.3.4.1.1.5.2. Con: Companies have an incentive to pick the best people for positions so they can make the largest profit. The failure to select more women is associated with their [higher costs to business](http://web.simmons.edu/~turnerg/MCC/Schwartz1989.pdf) rather than companies not recognising their merit.
1.3.4.1.1.5.2.1. Con: The source is from 1989, roughly 30 years ago. It is likely that things have changed and a better source should be provided.
1.3.4.1.1.5.2.2. Con: Women have a lower cost to businesses because [they pay them less than men](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/08/why-the-gender-pay-gap-still-exists-55-years-after-the-equal-pay-act.html).
1.3.4.1.1.5.3. Con: The claim that hiring ought to be based upon merit, as an ideal goal, is not contradicted by the fact that hiring in the present may not be strictly based on merit. The fact of current practical shortcomings of a goal does not invalidate the worthiness of the goal.
1.3.4.1.1.5.3.1. Con: Those arguing for women quotas should not have to argue against an ideal, if the reality still regularly excludes women.
1.3.4.1.1.5.4. Pro: A [study](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/workplace-gender-quotas-incompetence-efficiency-business-organisations-london-school-economics-lse-a7797061.html) found that gender quotas increase the competence of organisations by leading to the displacement of mediocre men.
1.3.4.1.1.5.5. Pro: When boards and [headhunters](http://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/article-details/getting-headhunters-on-board-with-diversity) assess a pool of thousands of possible candidates for a position, it is easier for them to select from those individuals with which they are familiar from networks they are already connected with. Given that these individuals are mostly men, these networks are also dominated by men. Quotas give them an incentive to look outside those networks to find the best candidate.
1.3.4.1.1.5.5.1. Con: The conclusion does not follow from the premises. If headhunters rely on networks to select talent, and the networks are mostly men, it doesn't logically follow that quotas incentivize them to look outside the networks for the best candidate. What follows from the premises \(which are questionable themselves\) is that quotas incentive headhunters to look outside their networks for the candidate that fulfills the quota criteria, not necessarily the best candidate.
1.3.4.1.1.5.5.1.1. Con: The additional costs associated with looking outside existing networks may mean that the marginal benefit to headhunters themselves from selecting from outside networks is not worth it in the status quo, even if it results in the selection of a better candidate. Quotas change that decision making calculus in a way which means that better candidates are selected and more of them are women.
1.3.4.1.1.5.6. Pro: [This](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.2010.55.4.543) research highlights the problem of "merit paradox". When an organizational culture promotes meritocracy \(compared with when it does not\), managers in that organization ironically show greater bias in favor of men over equally performing women in translating employee performance evaluations into rewards and other key career outcomes.
1.3.4.1.1.5.6.1. Con: This [research](http://dspace.mit.edu) does not \(apparently\) have any support in references or additional citations, receiving mostly media interest.
1.3.4.1.1.6. Pro: People who work hard deserve to be rewarded for that regardless of their gender.
1.3.4.1.1.7. Pro: There are broad gender differences in capacity and interest; more women than men *may* be the "right" number for a business concentrating on healthcare, while more men than women *may* be the "right" number for a business concentrating on off-shore drilling. Quotas do not permit individual variance and personal inclination which *may* be correclated with gender.
1.3.4.1.1.8. Pro: Forgoing the most competent candidate for a less competent candidate of the right gender harms productivity and in turn, society.
1.3.4.1.1.8.1. Con: The best candidate for the benefit of society may not be the same as the best candidate for a company's interests. Societal value differs from corporate financial gain in that one must also account for such impacts as representation, quality of life and equality.
1.3.4.1.1.8.2. Pro: Productivity of a nation is [strongly correlated](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/blog/well-being-and-gdp.htm) with an array of desirable life traits: [life](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20217835) [expectancy](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy), [happiness](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction), [health](https://ourworldindata.org/burden-of-disease), [attainment](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction), [free time](http://klenow.com/Jones_Klenow.pdf), and [social mobility](https://www.oxera.com/getmedia/ea133d87-911f-4d0f-87fb-16964c74f569/Social-mobility-and-the-economy.pdf.aspx?ext=.pdf), [among others](https://ourworldindata.org/).
1.3.4.1.1.9. Pro: Is there anywhere that it is illegal to discriminate against women? It is reprehensible to suggest that there should be quotas for women in highly sought after positions when only men are required to register for the draft.
1.3.4.1.1.10. Pro: To put quotas on these positions as an experiment for social change forces an unnecessary risk onto investors, who will ultimately pay the price for decisions made in the board room, good or bad. Only qualified individuals should serve on boards, or in Executive positions, as rising to them is a responsibility that should be merit based.
1.3.4.1.1.11. Con: The ongoing obstacles faced by [women in business](https://isdsnet.com/ijds-v3n3-5.pdf), including sexism, larger familial obligations and a lack of mentors indicates that a woman who has achieved a similar amount that a man has in business is in fact likely to be a candidate of greater merit.
1.3.4.1.1.11.1. Con: This is not an argument for a quota rather than an argument for basing individual employment and advancement decisions on factors beyond those directly related to the position at hand.
1.3.4.1.1.11.1.1. Con: Special accommodations in employment are made for those with disabilities. Societal disabilities should be considered as well.
1.3.5. Con: Instating a quota might lend businesses to view them as a ceiling rather than a floor on the number of women, stalling progress on equality in the long run.
1.4. Con: Quotas will detract from the accomplishments of women who would have earned the position by merit alone.
1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.6.
1.4.2. Pro: Women who hold positions of authority will not be respected or listened to, even if they occupy those positions as a result of their own merit.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Exposure to female leaders doesn’t reduce stereotyping but often reinforces it, creating [“extreme perceptions”](http://www.catalyst.org/media/catalyst-study-exposes-how-gender-based-stereotyping-sabotages-women-workplace) of female leaders.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.3.2.1.
1.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.3.1.
1.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.3.2.
1.4.2.4. Pro: Women who benefit from Affirmative Action policies in the USA are [seen by other employees](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/03/economist-explains-14) as less qualified than their male peers, worse at their job than their male counterparts and less legitimate in holding their role.
1.4.2.5. Pro: In Norway, even though 40.5% of board positions are occupied by women, less than 1% of CEOs are women [\(Stary, p. 22\)](http://law.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/1709500/2-KateStary-CorporateGovernanceandDirectorsDutiesPaper2.pdf). This indicates that women's contributions on boards are not valued such that they advance to CEO.
1.4.3. Con: Quotas are designed to ensure that those wielding powers of selection are forced to consider candidates they would have otherwise ignored. This cannot be automatically interpreted to say that those selected have no merit to hold the role. Quotas do not mean a relaxing of valid criteria for selection, just an elimination of the bias displayed by those who would rather stick to the comforting familiarity of hiring men into positions of power.
1.4.3.1. Con: Eliminating bias can be handled by stricter evaluation methods that ensure performance is evaluated objectively. Quotas just hide the problem of bias rather than solving it.
1.4.3.2. Con: While it is true that it cannot be interpreted to say applicants don't have the merit to hold the role, that is not the problem with quotas in the first place. The problem is strictly with factoring in an orthogonal criteria to hiring, specifically one so fraught with obvious negative consequences as gender, race, etc.
1.5. Pro: The current work environment means that without quotas women simply do not get selected for these roles, even if they are qualified.
1.5.1. Pro: A lack of women in leadership positions means that women lack [role models and mentors](https://assets.rockefellerfoundation.org/app/uploads/20160512082818/Women-in-Leadership-Why-It-Matters.pdf) to help them climb the corporate ladder.
1.5.1.1. Pro: When young women see themselves represented in positions of power, they are more likely to apply to these positions in the first place.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: If women believe that gender-related barriers to success exist in their chosen occupation, then they may be especially inspired by a female role model, who suggests that similar success may be possible for other women in spite of these barriers. \(Lockwood, [pg.3](https://www.hw.ac.uk/documents/same-gender-role-models.pdf)\)
1.5.1.2. Con: Women’s token status in organizations increases the pressure to perform. This may make potential women mentors less likely to take on the risk of a protégé whose failure would reflect negatively on the mentor. The female mentor/female protégé relationship is the most visible of all gender and mentoring combinations and faces the greatest risks. Therefore, women mentors may prefer male protégés over female ones. \(The Handbook of Mentoring at Work: Theory, Research, and Practice, [pg.204](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=haVXOcQ3OLQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA204#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: The lack of women in the upper tiers of corporate and management structures also contributes to women who do make it into these positions [report feeling isolated](https://fairygodboss.com/articles/gender-equality-in-the-workplace-we-are-not-there-yet) as the only woman \(or one of very few women\) on their level. More women in leadership could reduce that feeling of isolation, and should help improve the experience of being a woman in leadership.
1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: In the status quo, the small number of women on boards have to compete for limited acknowledgement. Increasing their number may also increase competition among those women and only increase feelings of isolation.
1.5.1.2.1.2. Pro: [Research](https://hbr.org/2013/09/women-rising-the-unseen-barriers) has shown that when women are isolated in the upper structures of a company they are more likely to display risk-averse behaviour which can deny the company of more innovative contributions to the workplace.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Cross-gender mentoring relationships face many challenges in reality and in the perceptions of those relationships by others. Women are more affected than men because they are more likely than men to be in such relationships. These challenges include the absence of role-modeling, intimacy concerns, gender stereotyping that limits individual growth, public scrutiny of the relationship, and possible peer resentment \(The Handbook of Mentoring at Work: Theory, Research, and Practice,[pg.205](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=haVXOcQ3OLQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA205#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: It is noted that compared to cross-gender mentoring relationships, same-gender mentoring relationships between people who are assumed to be heterosexual by others are less susceptible to sexual innuendos and rumors and have less potential to develop into romantic relationship. Jealous spouses and resentful coworkers are also a problem in same-gender mentoring relationships. \([pg.205](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=haVXOcQ3OLQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA205#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.5.1.3.2. Pro: Women are often hesitant to initiate a cross-gender mentoring relationship because of the fear that it could be misconstrued as a sexual advance by the mentor or others \([pg.205](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=haVXOcQ3OLQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA205#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.5.1.3.3. Pro: Women’s greater participation in cross-gender mentoring relationships provide them with qualitatively different mentoring experiences than those of their male colleagues since participants in such relationships assume more sex-stereotypical roles. This contributes to an unlevel playing field for managerial and professional women, making advancement more difficult. \([pg.206](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=haVXOcQ3OLQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA205#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.5.1.3.4. Pro: The prevalence of cross-gender mentoring relationships which are not ideal for women in corporate structures is additionally damaging as negative protégé experiences cause severe harm to health, behaviour and workplace decision making, according to [this study.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222801754_Are_bad_experiences_stronger_than_good_ones_in_mentoring_relationships_Evidence_from_the_protege_and_mentor_perspective)
1.5.1.4. Con: Mentorship programmes are often [ineffective and ill thought-out](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/corporate-mentorship-programs/528927/) within companies. It is unlikely that increasing women's access to such programmes would have a large effect on their career progression.
1.5.1.4.1. Pro: In Norway; a country that has implemented this policy, the average number of board positions held by women is [four,](http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/40-for-norways-golden-skirt-board-members-do-companies-need-quotas-for-women.html) with some women holding 25 positions. It is unlikely that such women will have the time needed to be an effective mentor to women in all of these companies along with their other responsibilities.
1.5.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.
1.5.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.2.1.
1.5.1.6. Con: Men can equally serve as role models and mentors to women.
1.5.1.6.1. Con: Women have a greater need for a role model who shares their “minority” status as they may find it difficult to identify with a member of the majority group and consequently, they may gain more from exposure to a female than a male role model. \(Lockwood,[pg.2](https://www.hw.ac.uk/documents/same-gender-role-models.pdf)\)
1.5.1.6.1.1. Pro: In a study by Brewer & Weber, members of a distinctive minority group rated themselves more positively after exposure to a successful rather than unsuccessful in-group member. In contrast, members of a majority group rated themselves less positively after exposure to a successful rather than unsuccessful in-group member. Among women who perceive themselves to be in a minority group for their profession, the success of another woman can have a positive impact on their self-perceptions. \([pg.2](https://www.hw.ac.uk/documents/same-gender-role-models.pdf)\)
1.5.1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.
1.5.1.6.3. Con: Given how few women are present in these senior managerial or board positions, it seems clear that men are not currently invested in mentoring women to help them achieve this.
1.5.2. Con: There is no evidence that this is the case. The evidence only shows that a lower percentage of women get promoted, but that doesn't exclude the possibility of other co-variables that are found in a higher distribution of women than men and [which are universally associated with lower promotion rates](http://www.businessinsider.com/big-five-personality-traits-predict-leadership-2016-12), like doing less work overtime, and [being more agreeable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11519935), being the cause of the lower distribution of women being promoted.
1.5.2.1. Con: [Women are penalized for being “agreeable,"](http://theconversation.com/how-skills-and-personality-traits-contribute-to-the-gender-pay-gap-81684) but men aren’t. Being "agreeable" is not a viable reason why women get promoted less because it does not affect men.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.
1.5.4. Pro: The most recent [data](http://fortune.com/2017/02/06/board-diversity-fortune-500/) from Fortune 500 companies show that women only make up 20.2% of board members.
1.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.5.5. Pro: [In Norway](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/03/economist-explains-14), where a quota system was introduced in 2006, female board members are more likely to have a college education than male board members, yet male board members remain twice as likely to be on more than one board of directors than their female counterparts.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Similarly, in Italy, female board members are [more likely](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21737079-gender-quotas-board-level-europe-have-done-little-boost-corporate-performance-or) to hold relevant professional degrees or qualifications than their male predecessors.
1.5.6. Con: Women might have difficulties getting managerial jobs and might be less than men in total but this is not a problem in the western world. The quotas were invented initially for the cases that a boost in women's participation and promotion was needed for a period, because of a previous state of male chauvinism or a social status of depression against women. In normal cases, the markets should select freely. If they take less women, this means that less women deserve such positions.
1.5.7. Con: It is already illegal in most first-world countries to discriminate based on gender.
1.5.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.
1.6. Con: Gender imbalance in the workplace exists due to innate differences between men and women, rather than as a result of systemic barriers. As a consequence of these innate differences, most women simply do not desire leadership roles. Gender quotas will not change this reality rendering them counter productive.
1.6.1. Pro: A study found that when workers were asked to imagine a promotion in their current organization, women anticipated more [negative outcomes](http://www.slate.com/culture/2018/03/katy-perrys-kiss-and-the-regressive-sexual-politics-of-american-idol.html) \(stress, burden of responsibility, time sacrifice\) than men. Such an attitude demonstrates the lack of desirability for females to be promoted to positions of leadership in the workplace.
1.6.1.1. Con: This may be due to hostile workplace culture rather than a lack of desire for promotion.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.2.1.
1.6.1.1.2. Pro: One barrier women face can be a female exclusionary atmosphere. Examples of this include not having adequate provision of female bathrooms \(only on certain floors/ less stalls etc.\), and having male-dominated culture \(office culture of making lewd or sexist jokes, company traditions of entertaining clients at all-male golf clubs etc.\). These barriers to entry are invisible until there is a woman to experience them.
1.6.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.6.1.2. Con: This may be due to women having more domestic responsibilities on top of their paid employment than their male counterparts, rather than a lack of desire for promotion.
1.6.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.1.1.
1.6.2. Pro: Research has found that men are more likely than women to engage in dominant or aggressive behaviors, to initiate negotiations, and to self-select into competitive environments — behaviors likely to facilitate professional advancement.
1.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.3.
1.6.2.2. Con: These behaviours that this claim describes men as being more likely to perform are not necessarily innate even if they are more common in men than women. Behaviours such as aggression or docility can be encouraged by societal stereotypes. Therefore this claim is not necessarily a pro for its parent.
1.6.3. Pro: The lack of women in leadership roles can be attributed to women making different life choices than men. For example, it was revealed in a published editorial that women desire to embrace their role as [child-bearers](https://slate.com/culture/2018/03/katy-perrys-kiss-and-the-regressive-sexual-politics-of-american-idol.html) rather than choosing to work in a leadership role.
1.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.1.1.
1.6.3.2. Pro: A [study](https://www.ccl.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WhatWomenWant.FINAL_.pdf) found that women who refused leadership roles did so because the long hours and added work load would conflict with their desire for a more balanced life. This reinforces the claim that the innate differences between men and women, and how these differences lead to different life choices, can account for the lack of gender parity in leadership roles.
1.6.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.1.1.
1.6.3.3. Con: Simply because something is written in a "published editorial" does not give it validity. A published editorial is not usually reviewed by a panel of peers who have expertise in the subject and can interrogate the statistical methods used by the author. Whilst some women may desire to "embrace their role as child bearers", lack of statistical evidence here tells us nothing about the proportion who do, or any difference with men.
1.6.4. Con: There is clear evidence that suggests women do desire opportunities for promotion to leadership roles. The lack of gender parity in leadership positions is due to barriers in the workplace, such as a lack of development opportunities for women, rather than as a result of percieved innate differences.
1.6.4.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.ccl.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WhatWomenWant.FINAL_.pdf) found that 74.1% of women said they were interested to extremely interested in moving up one or more levels in their organization \(e.g., promotion\).
1.6.4.2. Pro: A [study](http://graphics.wsj.com/how-men-and-women-see-the-workplace-differently/) demonstrated that firms have afforded fewer development opportunities to women in contrast to men. This unfairly hinders the prospects of women for promotion due to barriers in the workplace, rather than innate biological differences.
1.6.5. Con: One should not be so blithely prepared to claim that there aren't men in leadership roles who are less suited to it than women who work for them: dismissing sexism in the workplace and in hiring practices is both callous and hermeneutically disingenuous. If there are more men at the top, they are more likely to hire more men for such roles, because men are who they are in the habit of working with. Quotas help to counter this phenomenon, and can potentially be removed once parity is established.
1.7. Pro: Having women in senior positions allows them to change the culture of companies in order to support women in lower positions.
1.7.1. Con: Women who already occupy a top position in a company have no incentive to care about the welfare of those in lower positions.
1.7.1.1. Pro: They may even have an incentive not to care about women in lower positions. They work as part of a board with a bunch of men who's respect they need in order to do their job. The men may become less receptive to their ideas if they involve helping women in lower positions.
1.7.1.2. Pro: A [study](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/the-queen-bee-in-the-corner-office/534213/) found that female workers did not want to work for female managers. There’s no incentive for female workers in higher positions to care about female workers in lower positions when the latter don’t like the former.
1.7.1.3. Pro: Women in top positions know little to nothing about the difficulties experienced by women working in lower positions.
1.7.1.3.1. Con: It is unlikely that women who get these positions will not have had to work their way up the corporate ladder, meaning they will also have experience in lower roles.
1.7.1.4. Con: Women supporting each other in the workplace serves as a blow to the patriarchal system which affects all women.
1.7.1.5. Pro: The more senior the position women occupy in workplaces, the more likely women are to agree that their pay is [fair](http://www.greatplacetowork.co.uk/storage/documents/women%20at%20work%20is%20it%20still%20a%20mans%20world%20may%202015.pdf). This reduces the incentive of women in senior roles to be concerned with matters of pay pertaining to women in lower positions.
1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.7.3. Con: Quotas do not necessitate that the number of women be equal or greater than the number of men in these positions. It is unlikely that women in these positions will be able to change much if they are outnumbered by male counterparts who already do not like the quota system.
1.7.3.1. Con: Simply having women present in management settings can expose barriers to entry that were overlooked previously. This can range from an exclusionary atmosphere to damaging policy. These issues cannot be tackled as effectively without women occupying these positions.
1.7.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.1.2.
1.7.3.1.2. Pro: Another barrier to entry can be company policies that are disproportionately damaging to women. Poor maternity leave, or a perception that women of child-bearing age could not be trusted not to leave the company 'in the lurch' can damage women from being selected for managerial positions, or from putting themselves forward for such positions in the first place.
1.7.3.1.3. Con: Many countries have Gender Equality laws and policies to deal with barriers to entry for corporate women.
1.7.3.1.3.1. Con: These laws are often [insufficient](https://fairygodboss.com/articles/gender-equality-in-the-workplace-we-are-not-there-yet), especially in targeting barriers that are harder to pinpoint, such as bias and exclusionary behaviour or attitudes within a company's upper echelons.
1.7.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.3.1.2.1.
1.7.3.2. Con: Women in these positions can use their status to raise the wages of those below them, decreasing the overall wage gap in their sector.
1.7.3.2.1. Con: The application of gender quotas in [Norway](http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/gender-quotas-dont-help-businesses-they-dont-even-help-women) had no demonstrable effect on reducing the gender pay gap, nor did it help provide an incentive for women to enter the business world.
1.7.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.7.3.2.2. Con: Women in senior roles are less likely to use their status to actively work towards addressing the wage gap for those in lower positions.
1.7.3.2.2.1. Pro: The [pay gap](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/8902849/Pay-gap-between-rich-and-poor-at-its-highest.html) between the highest and lowest earners has reached an all-time high.
1.7.3.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.5.
1.7.3.2.3. Pro: The majority of medium and large companies pay [higher wage rates](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43129339) to men than to women.
1.7.4. Con: Companies may deliberately select female board members and managers who are not likely to challenge the way in which the company works. As a result, they can comply with the quota and not have to accept any change.
1.7.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.7.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.5.5.
1.7.4.3. Con: -> See 1.4.3.
1.7.5. Pro: Having more women in managerial positions will help break the stereotype that women cannot be good leaders.
1.7.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.3.1.
1.7.5.2. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.7.5.3. Con: Having women put in managerial positions as a result of quotas will create a stereotype that women cannot make it on their own merit, and need a helping hand from government to perform as well as men. It will reduce the achievement of a woman getting such a position, because people will question if the woman really earned that position, or if they only got it because of their gender.
1.7.5.4. Pro: Increased demand for female leaders will encourage supply of women possessing and pursuing leadership skills to increase.
1.7.5.5. Pro: People tend to view men as leaders and women as followers. If given the choice between a male or female boss when taking a new job, Americans strongly lean towards men and prefer a male boss over a female boss by [35% to 23%](http://news.gallup.com/poll/165791/americans-prefer-male-boss.aspx). However, those who currently work for a woman are as likely to prefer having a female boss as a male one.
1.7.5.6. Con: Senior managers who themselves report directly to female managers were found to be more likely to hold [stereotyped](http://women.govt.nz/inspiring-action-for-gender-balance/women-take-care-men-take-charge-stereotyping-us-business-leaders) views of women, suggesting that exposure to women leaders is not enough to reverse the phenomenon.
1.7.5.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.7.5.7. Pro: Deeply entrenched cultural beliefs dictate that women are to be seen as less qualified or less ["natural"](http://vitaminw.co/business/spot-difference-how-unconscious-gender-bias-leads-missed-opportunities) in leadership roles. Having more women from culturally diverse backgrounds in managerial positions will help break this stereotype.
1.7.5.8. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.3.2.
1.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.1.
1.7.7. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.2.
1.7.8. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.
1.7.9. Con: The Economist found this was "puzzlingly" not the case:  "[\[quotas\] had no discernible beneficial effect on women at lower levels of the corporate hierarchy](https://www.economist.com/business/2018/02/17/ten-years-on-from-norways-quota-for-women-on-corporate-boards)."

This includes Norway, which has had mandatory quotas for the last 10 years.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.
1.9. Con: It is impossible to morally justify gender quotas when they focus only on women at the top, while the prospects of women in lower positions continues to shrink.
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.2.2.1.
1.9.2. Pro: Not until quotas for women in the draft, in sanitation, and the sewage industry become mandatory.
1.9.3. Con: If there were more women at the top, surely the circumstances for women further down would improve.
1.9.4. Con: It is better to start improving circumstances for a subgroup of people instead to improving nothing at all for the group.
1.10. Con: There are a limited number of managerial positions, yet a multitude of ways that candidates are discriminated against. Privileging some types of discrimination will necessitate making others worse \(e.g., fewer spots for POC, disabled individuals, GBT candidates who happen to be male\).
1.10.1. Con: This doesn't make sense: there is no contradiction between being a woman and being disabled, LGBT or a POC. Moreover, increasing gender diversity will reduce the "boys club" mentality and help reduce discrimination. The absence of quotas does not benefit any of these groups.
1.11. Con: There is no reasonable method by which to specify what the quota should be. Determining quotas by population demographics ignores the personal choices that particular demographic groups make based on a multitude of reasons.
1.12. Con: Governments should not intervene in the hiring and promotional practices of companies without serious cause to do so.
1.12.1. Pro: One of the primary objectives of any business is to make money. Mandating businesses to promote their employees based on gender rather than their ability to help turn over profits hinders the financial growth of businesses. Therefore governments should stay out of the promotional practices of businesses.
1.12.1.1. Con: Businesses have failed to provide women with the same development opportunities as men, unfairly hindering the promotional opportunities for women. Government imposed quotas will provide the financial incentive for businesses to correct their poor development opportunities for women, removing the need for government interference.
1.12.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.5.
1.12.1.2. Pro: Gender quotas have been responsible for driving away top talent which businesses are in need of to maximise financial growth.
1.12.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.2.
1.12.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.12.2. Con: In the US, there is a growing recognition that [market forces](https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-board-directors-really-think-of-gender-quotas) will not correct the lack of gender diversity in leadership roles. If the government doesn’t intervene then there is no guarantee that this problem could ever be resolved.
1.12.3. Pro: The market has a natural corrective process for eliminating unprofitable business practices, like avoiding the hiring of qualified minorities. Those firms that behave irrationally due to ingrained bigotry will see their market share, and with it their revenue, drop, and consequently will see their share of the work force under their control decline at the expense of more rational and fair-minded companies.
1.12.3.1. Con: It is possible that the loss to profits incurred by not hiring qualified women is not large enough to cause firms to collapse. This is especially true if most other firms are acting in the same way because it means that sexist firms are not forced to compete with non-sexist ones. This does not mean that the failure to hire women of merit is not fair.
1.12.3.2. Con: Shareholders tend to be highly risk averse, even at the expense of possible profit. Shareholders tend to see women in leadership positions as a risk because of how uncommon they are in the status quo. Thus, companies may not appoint women even if it would be good for their business. The state has to step in and make clear the value of women in leadership roles.
1.12.4. Pro: The government mandating hiring practices violates the private property rights of the shareholders to decide who and for what reason to hire people. It would mean using forceful government action to punish particular sets of voluntary interactions, which violates the Non-Aggression Principle, which is the [defining principle of libertarian philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle).
1.12.4.1. Pro: Businesses and the people who contribute to them, through time, investment and subjecting themselves to risk are the ones who have built those businesses, not the government. Therefore, it is their right to decide how those businesses ought to be run, including hiring and promotion practices.
1.12.4.1.1. Con: States provide essential support to businesses through the provision of public infrastructure, the rule of law and other mechanisms. Without those supports, it is likely those businesses would not exist. Therefore, the state has a stake in that business and has a right to intervene in the way it is ran.
1.12.4.1.1.1. Pro: The framework which allows most public and privately owned companies to exist at all, [limited liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability), is provided by the state.
1.12.4.1.1.2. Con: Businesses and the people in charge of them did not explicitly consent to a large number of the things that the state gives them. Businesses cannot be said to meaningfully owe the state anything if it was provided without their input.
1.12.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Firms and the people involved in them choose to sign contracts supported by the state's rule of law, accept government subsidy and a host of other actions. They are fully capable of choosing not to engage with the state but do the opposite. The state is fully vindicated in intervening given that.
1.12.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Businesses are forced to avail of the services provided by the state because otherwise they would be out-competed by other businesses who would. It is unfair to force a firm to avail of a service and then use that as an excuse to intervene in that firms inner workings.
1.12.4.1.2. Pro: The government is perfectly entitled to fight gender inequality in publicly owned institutions, for instance by implementing gender quotas in parliaments - a policy implemented by over 40 countries. [\(Krook, p.2\)](https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/a3e15191-c680-4481-96c2-92181807b829.pdf)
1.12.4.2. Con: Corporate culture in businesses contributes to an environment in which women are stopped from fulfilling their full potential and are robbed of future opportunities and higher wages. Given that companies are complicit in that action, the Non-Aggression Principle does not apply. Companies are harming women and the state is justified in intervening.
1.12.5. Con: Discrimination is a serious cause and is so imbedded in business practice that it needs regulation to assist in changing things.
1.12.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.5.
1.12.5.2. Pro: The government has always passed laws in order to protect people from discrimination. Protecting women from discrimination in the workplace should be treated no differently. Just like the civil rights act in the US was enacted to protect people from discrimination based on racial grounds, gender quotas will protect women from being discriminated based on their gender in the workplace.
1.12.5.3. Con: Quotas are institutionalized discrimination; as such they are likely not the solution to the problem of discrimination.
1.12.5.3.1. Con: Institutionalized discrimination is what the quota is intended to combat.
1.13. Con: Quotas for women will lead to backlash as people will feel it makes the system unfair, and this will lead to a worse work environment.
1.13.1. Con: Backlash is a concern with any major reform policy that may be controversial. This does not mean that the policy is not worth pursuing.
1.13.2. Pro: A [study](https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/11850) found that women who hold right wing authoritarian beliefs were likely to express neo-sexist and hostile attitudes toward women if they believed in the existence of gender quotas within their organisation. Such a backlash will lead to a worse work environment.
1.13.3. Con: Most workers in large companies have little to no interaction with or awareness of the processes for the selection of boards and senior managers. They will not change their behaviour in the workplace as a result of this policy.
1.13.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.
1.13.5. Pro: Given the current sexism at board level, women promoted through a quota system would, to a degree, find themselves sidelined or targeted for abuse, thus reducing the coherence of the board.
1.13.6. Con: Conversely, the current system is unfair, which is why quotas are needed. Gender imbalance already leads to a tougher work environment for women.
1.14. Con: These quotas do not work, as they do not lead to benefits for the company or ultimately change anything about the culture.
1.14.1. Pro: Gender quotas are ineffective and counter-productive.
1.14.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.2.
1.14.1.2. Pro: [Research](http://www.cityam.com/article/gender-quotas-are-wrong-and-don-t-work-it-s-time-treat-people-individuals) has demonstrated that the application of gender quotas in Norway led to "younger and less experienced boards, increases in leverage and acquisitions, and deterioration in operating performance, consistent with less capable boards.” Therefore gender quotas are counter-productive in practice.
1.14.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.2.1.
1.14.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.
1.14.1.5. Con: A number of measures could mitigate potential negative effects of quotas.
1.14.1.5.1. Pro: The Netherlands’ quota system has an expiration data. This would allow women a period of time to build up experience and network mechanisms, put in place training mechanisms for following cohorts, and allow exposure to female corporate leaders. Once these mechanisms are in place long enough that a cadre of women prepared for leadership exists, the
quota could be removed. \([pg.17](https://piie.com/publications/wp/wp16-3.pdf)\)
1.14.1.5.2. Pro: Boards can be expanded to add more women but not at the expense of qualified men. This option comes from the world of sports. The International Triathlon Union, the governing body of the sport, mandates that a certain percent of leadership be women but allows for the addition of an extra board seat for every extra woman brought on board. \([pg.17](https://piie.com/publications/wp/wp16-3.pdf)\)
1.14.1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.
1.14.1.7. Pro: A quota system should only be applied to the earliest point in the labor pipeline where the gender imbalance occurs, this could be happening as early as high school. Focusing on managerial positions where the number applying for roles is already imbalanced is counter-productive.
1.14.1.8. Pro: Quotas do not address the root causes of workplace sexism. If people believe that women are worse at managerial positions they will continue to believe this independent of the quota.
1.14.1.8.1. Pro: Imposing quotas without studying why equal representation hasn't happened organically will only benefit women skilled at gaming a system that is still harder on average for a woman to navigate.
1.14.1.8.2. Pro: [Researchers](http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/careers/ct-biz-0707-work-advice-huppke-20140707-column.html) found that the marriage structure shaped men's attitudes, beliefs and behaviors toward women in the workplace. Imposing gender quotas will not address these root causes of workplace sexism rendering them counter-productive.
1.14.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.4.
1.14.1.10. Pro: Studies show that fewer women than men want to make the sacrifices and take on the stress involved in [top corporate positions](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-on-leadership-mother-bosses-20151004-story.html), just like fewer women than men want to take on the dirt and danger of construction. Attempting to create a quota system to achieve a level of parity that women themselves statistically do not want can only result in sexual discrimination against the greater number of men who are willing to make the sacrifices to achieve those top positions.
1.14.1.11. Pro: -> See 1.6.
1.14.1.12. Pro: Gender quotas will encourage women to exhibit sexist attitudes towards other women which is counter productive. The whole point of quotas is to rid workplaces of sexism, not to embolden it.
1.14.1.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.2.
1.14.1.12.2. Pro: Quotas set women against each other, competing for a certain number of "women's seats", which might destroy co-operation and unity.
1.14.1.13. Pro: Prospects for promotion come at a time when women choose to have [families](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/18/quotas-women-boardroom-equality). With expensive childcare, and few meaningful family-friendly workplaces, few of those talented women last long enough to make it to the top.
1.14.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.14.3. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.14.4. Con: A [study](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikaandersen/2012/03/26/the-results-are-in-women-are-better-leaders/#46e58da6e038) demonstrated that "more women were rated by their peers, their bosses, their direct reports, and their other associates as better overall leaders than their male counterparts".
1.14.5. Pro: These quotas do not actually help women.
1.14.5.1. Pro: Quotas in higher up positions may lead to fewer women hired at the bottom level.
1.14.5.1.1. Pro: If sexist men do not hire women because they do not like to work with women, they will hire the amount they need at the top and won't hire any others.
1.14.5.1.1.1. Con: In large companies, men on boards are not in charge of the minutiae of hiring at all levels. Even if they are sexist they will be unable to control the hiring process to this extent.
1.14.5.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.2.
1.14.5.1.1.2. Con: Increasing the number of women in senior positions will stop men from engaging in blatantly sexist hiring practices.
1.14.5.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.2.
1.14.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.14.1.8.
1.14.5.3. Pro: If a woman is hired in such position under a quota, she would have no way to be sure she's been hired for her capabilities for the job instead of just meeting the said quota. That would affect her workplace confidence, well being, and her authority over managees.
1.14.5.4. Con: -> See 1.7.5.
1.14.5.5. Pro: [When hiring women to their board](http://boardmember.com/3-mistakes-companies-make-when-recruiting-women-as-board-members/), current boards will likely choose women who have an in with them \(ie the CEO's best friend's wife\), women with [familial ties](https://qz.com/223405/indias-effort-for-more-women-on-boards-is-backfiring-in-the-worst-way/) to the board, women who have or are currently serving on another board, or women with passive personalities.
1.14.5.5.1. Pro: This allows companies to feign diversity while maintaining the "boy's club" of managerial positions.
1.14.5.5.2. Pro: This creates a false sense of solvency, convincing people that the issue of gender diversity is less urgent than they thought, making it harder for feminist groups to rally for it.
1.14.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.
1.14.5.7. Con: -> See 1.7.
1.14.5.8. Con: -> See 1.7.1.4.
1.14.5.9. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.
1.14.5.10. Con: Women in leadership roles will serve as important role models to other women who seek to ascend the corporate ladder.
1.14.5.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.14.5.11. Pro: -> See 1.14.1.12.
1.14.5.12. Pro: -> See 1.14.1.13.
1.14.6. Con: Analysis of a global survey of 21,980 firms from 91 countries found no impact of board gender quotas on firm performance. \([pg.3](https://piie.com/publications/wp/wp16-3.pdf),7\)
1.14.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.14.8. Pro: The same set of qualified women; referred to as as [golden skirts](http://sciencenordic.com/golden-skirts-fill-board-rooms), hold multiple board positions, reducing diversity and undermining their ability to create meaningful change.
1.14.8.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.
1.14.8.2. Con: [Over-boarding](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21737079-gender-quotas-board-level-europe-have-done-little-boost-corporate-performance-or) is a challenge that applies to male and female board members, so while it is a challenge to overcome, it is not a problem that only applies to female board members, and it would be unfair to link this problem to the introduction of gender quotas.
1.14.9. Pro: Corporate gender quotas have produced marginal results in the countries that have adopted them.
1.14.9.1. Pro: The [highest](http://time.com/2861431/female-executives-gender-quotas/) proportions of women with senior roles in corporations are in countries that have not enacted compulsory quotas. Russia has the highest proportion of women in senior management globally \(43 percent\) without any type of gender programming. The same applies for the neighboring Baltic States which boast 30 percent or more. Between 2012 and 2013, China doubled the number of senior management roles held by women from 25 per cent to 51 per cent.
1.14.9.2. Pro: Only [3 percent](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-sandvik-scania-are-addressing-the-ceo-gender-gap-1400712884) of 145 Nordic large-cap companies have a female chief executive.
1.14.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.5.
1.14.9.4. Pro: Spain \(22 percent\), Germany \(14 percent\), and Switzerland \(13 percent\) were among the bottom 10 countries in a [2014 report](https://mic.com/articles/84601/the-countries-with-the-highest-number-of-female-executives-are-not-the-ones-you-d-expect#.AsQ1BJ3qX) by accounting firm Grant Thornton, and had some of the lowest proportions of women in senior management roles in the world, despite domestic policies addressing this issue.
1.14.10. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.14.11. Pro: Quotas address the symptom rather than the cause.
1.14.11.1. Pro: Instead to address the cause we could require that when accepting a man over any number of women for an open board level position that each person rejected be provided with the reasons. That process of accumulating those reasons \(and on average finding them fewer and/or thinner for the women than for the men\) could be educational at least.
1.14.11.1.1. Pro: The reasons would be filled in on a standard digital form to prevent the board from just saying something meaningless like 'worst candidate for the job'. The form would be designed to promote rational decision making and the finished forms could be reviewed by a watchdog organisation or in court.
1.14.11.1.1.1. Pro: Though the form would be mandatory for jobs at board level companies could adopt a policy to also use it at lower levels to promote rational analysis of applicants both at all levels and by those promoted to the board internally from recruiting roles.
1.14.11.1.1.2. Pro: It's plausible that the potential both for a questionable decision to be referenced in a suit or for a pattern of suspicious behaviour to be spotted by the watchdog could be incentive to take a more rational approach to filling board level roles.
1.14.11.1.2. Con: There's no particular reason why this should be limited to only when a man has been accepted over one or more woman. It would be equally effective against other bias.
1.14.11.1.2.1. Pro: Providing the reasons to all those rejected would forestall objections that it's unfair to provide information only to women
1.14.11.1.3. Con: Currently, there are [many laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_employment_opportunity) that prohibit discriminatory hiring or promoting practices, yet they still take place, suggesting that is is easy to give reasons why a man was selected over a female candidate, even if they are not the true reason for a discriminatory decision. This suggests an alternative policy, such as having to justify selection decisions, would not prevent discriminatory selections.
1.14.11.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.14.12. Con: Studies have shown that greater gender balance on company boards does [change](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21737079-gender-quotas-board-level-europe-have-done-little-boost-corporate-performance-or) the decision making processes of those boards, despite the fact that female board members did not hold certain types of views, or fill certain roles on the boards.
1.14.13. Pro: Norway has had gender quotas for boards for ten years, and has found that a key shortcoming of the quotas has been that there has been [no effect or benefit](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21737079-gender-quotas-board-level-europe-have-done-little-boost-corporate-performance-or) for women at lower levels of the corporate hierarchy.
1.14.13.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
