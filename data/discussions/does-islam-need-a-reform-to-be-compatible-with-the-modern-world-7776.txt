Discussion Title: Does Islam Need A Reform To Be Compatible With The Modern World?

1. Islam needs a reform to be compatible with the modern world.
1.1. Con: The thesis is too broad. There are already many liberal strains within Islam that already are compatible with the modern world.
1.1.1. Con: But these are exactly that - just small strains. The mainstream Islam is quite illiberal.
1.1.2. Pro: There are [many Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_and_progressivism_within_Islam) who are creating bodies of work supporting progressive and liberal Islam.
1.1.3. Con: Although such people and movements exist, they are [under threat](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/berlin-s-first-liberal-mosque-its-female-leader-fight-modern-n781666) and suffer from wide disapproval within the Muslim societies.
1.2. Con: Islam is a religion. Religion needs human minds to exist. Changing a religion's text or structure does not change its exegesis. Hence, Islam is as modern as the people practicing it and their epistemologies.
1.2.1. Con: Changing text - even by adding to it - absolutely changes religions. Judaism was dramatically modernised by the addition of the Talmud and the lack of this re-interpretation / trans-interpretation in Islam is exactly what has prevented modernisation. One could also argue that the lack of a similar process since the Talmud has similarly hindered Orthodox Judaism.
1.2.1.1. Con: The Qur'an is considered the word of God, so changing it or adding to it is basically sacrilegious.
1.2.2. Pro: The belief structure behind it is more important than the specifics of religious doctrine; Islam can therefore be left alone to develop as it needs.
1.2.3. Con: Reform isn’t only about changing texts, but also to change how to deal with text and how to interpret it.
1.3. Con: Islam cannot be upgraded because divine book \(Quran\) says it is already perfect.
1.3.1. Con: Judaism and its texts was likely thought of as divinely perfect and yet God still sent Jesus and then Mohammad \(pbuh\).
1.3.2. Con: Like all holy books, much of the Quran is open to interpretation. So there is room for some reform.
1.3.3. Pro: In order for this to work, Muslims would have to accept that there is only one perfect Quran and it exists in heaven alone. Any version that has been passed down through humans, should be considered imperfect and therefore subject to critique and questioning.
1.3.4. Pro: Quran is a divine book.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Quran contains scientific claims, unknown at the time of its creation.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: It also contains many more unscientific claims
1.3.4.1.2. Con: It does not contain any such scientific claims actually, and contains many claims that have been proven false. [rationalwiki.org](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Qur%27anic_scientific_foreknowledge)
1.3.5. Con: Being believed by Muslims to be perfect doesn’t make it compatible with modern world.
1.3.6. Pro: In addition, the Qur'an claims itself to be perfect and can't be improved.
1.3.7. Con: Quran, as any other sacred religious text has no supernatural origin.
1.4. Con: Every religion needs a reform to be compatible with the modern world. We need to simply detach politics/life with religion and ideology. They can co-exist but one should not influence the other.
1.5. Pro: All religions need constant reform to be compatible with the ever-changing moral value structure of the modern world. Islam is no exception to this rule.
1.5.1. Pro: [Christianity](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alex-wilhelm/christianity-must-adapt-w_b_552729.html) is acknowledging a need to adapt; Islam ought to do the same.
1.5.2. Con: Just because the populace and youth do not desire to follow the rules of the religion does not mean the rules of the religion should be changed. The word of God does not have a time limit, per say. There are 'soft' things that can be interpreted and considered, but one cannot expect a religion to change very much at a fundamental level.
1.6. Con: It is the modern world that should be made compatible with Islam.
1.6.1. Pro: Islam has solutions to many contemporary societal problems.
1.6.1.1. Con: Contemporary non Muslim societies are generally performing better than contemporary Muslim societies
1.6.2. Con: The world shouldn't change itself to one religion. Some religions are incompatible. And saying the society should change to accept all the spectrum of interpretations of one and only one religion isn't only not inclusive at all, but also only based on the subjective argument that this one belief is better than all the others.
1.6.3. Con: This is an extraordinary claim without any evidence offered and can therefore be countered simply: it most definitely does not.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Surely any religion that has caused a degree of [violence](https://www.csis.org/analysis/islam-and-patterns-terrorism-and-violent-extremism) against those who don't practise it, even if this is a tiny minority of its followers, is not compatible with a world in which tolerance is promoted to such an extent.
1.7. Pro: Without adapting to modern realities, Islam will eventually lose followers and become irrelevant.
1.7.1. Pro: Any 1400 year-old idea, methodology or concept has to be reformed to be compatible with modern world, you can’t use 1400 years old teachings in the modern world.
1.7.2. Con: Iran, Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon and many more have capital cities which [were much more cosmopolitan](https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/the-death-of-arab-secularism-1.589937) and liberal in values a few decades ago. The evidence suggests that in terms of population and strength of adherence [Islam is thriving](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/09/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/) with this anti-modern direction.
1.8. Pro: Some central tenets of Islam make it hard to be compatible with modern world in fields such as: gender equality, religious tolerance, science-based debate.
1.8.1. Pro: Islam teaches that men should have power over women
1.8.1.1. Pro: But not to use that power in an evil way.
1.8.1.2. Con: This is true of most major religions.
1.8.1.2.1. Con: This is true, however, the assertion is not within the scope of the central question.
1.8.2. Con: Muslim principles of lending do emphasize community over capital. In times of raising income inequality this is very much needed.
1.8.2.1. Con: There are many other philosophies which encourage this which aren't Muslim and which are more modern.
1.8.3. Pro: It not just that Islamic law 'cannot be applied' in modernity - it is that they should not. Islamic law is - by modern standards - patriarchal, barbaric and violent. For Islam to be morally acceptable in the modern world, it requires a reformation.
1.8.4. Pro: If we look at how science has evolved in this world, we see that up until the sacking of Baghdad in 1258 almost all of the scientific breakthroughs were from the Islamic parts of the world. There is a reason that most stars have Arabic names. [Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl1nJC3lvFs), however, the Islamic faith says that manipulation of numbers is a sin. Out of 1 billion Muslims, only 3 have won a [Nobel Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Muslim_Nobel_laureates) in science.
1.8.5. Pro: Islam is very far behind. Part of this is due to Wahhabism, [sponsored by Saudi](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/mohammed-bin-salman-break-saudi-wahhabi-pact-180107091158729.html). The progress made in the latter 1800s by the Ottomans is gone. Beheadings, stonings, the list goes on. If majority were against it, they would boycott Mecca. They don't. Human Rights simply not something the Muftis support. The laypeople are perhaps waking up, but slowly. They have been taught to listen to their local [Shaykh](http://factsanddetails.com/world/cat55/sub358/item1448.html). Lack of authority structure makes Reformation impossible. Must be from the layfolk.
1.9. Pro: Islam is more than a religion; it is an ideology. It seeks to control all aspects of human existence. Unfortunately, it does not encourage a critical analysis of the Quran and demands blind adherence to a belief system that was born of warfare and subjugation. If there should be no compulsion in religion, then the penalty for apostasy wouldn't be death.
1.10. Con: There is an ontological difference between Islam and modernity. Islam embraces the very idea of submission to God \(Allah\); whereas modernity adheres the philosophy of anthropocentrism that is 'man is the centre of the universe' this means 'man' will determine the course of action of this planet or beyond with no divine intervention. Therefore there is a thick line between two ideologies and hence Islam cannot be compatible with the modern world.
