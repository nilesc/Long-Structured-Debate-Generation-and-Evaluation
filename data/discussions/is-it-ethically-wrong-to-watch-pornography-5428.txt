Discussion Title: Is it ethically wrong to watch pornography?

1. It is not ethically wrong to watch pornography.
1.1. Pro: Acts of media consumption have a somewhat abstract relationship to ethics. It is difficult, perhaps impossible to draw a clear connection between the act of seeing and personal culpability or responsibility for that which one sees.
1.2. Con: Watching porn indirectly [supports](http://humantraffickingsearch.org/the-connection-between-sex-trafficking-and-pornography/) prostitution, sexual coercion and human trafficking.
1.3. Pro: Porn is made to promote arousal, entertainment and even escapism. As long as the one watching is an adult that knows what happens in screen may differ from reality, there is nothing morally wrong with it.
1.3.1. Con: This perhaps relies on a reductive and simplistic understanding of media consumption, which almost certainly involves parts of the psyche that are more vulnerable than the conscious intellect. Our minds are vulnerable beyond the scope of our conscious awareness.
1.3.2. Con: Personal psychological detrimental effects do not nearly exhaust the potential suffering which is caused by the production and dissemination of pornography. Actresses and actors are affected by the industry.
1.3.3. Pro: Sexuality for most people is a fundamental component of the human condition. Pornography is a sexual performance and needs to be placed in the context of "Acting" as it presents an unrealistic ideal of sex and body image.  If pornography is handled intelligently and in a mature fashion without legislating the morality of others then pornography can be free from ethical complications.
1.3.3.1. Con: It is conceivable that there is no way to consume this type of media without ingesting its potentially psychologically negative effects. Legislation entirely aside, our media and culture cultivates an ensuing mass psychology that is rather extremely not-understood, nor given much energy or attention.
1.4. Pro: Plenty of porn is made in an ethical and safe way. It is perfectly possible to make choices about what porn you watch so that it is ethical.
1.4.1. Con: It may be something more elemental in the structure of the media which engenders and cultivates a subliminally misogynistic or reductive or otherwise violent way of seeing, particularly of men seeing women.
1.4.2. Pro: Porn should have an ethical certificate from independent regulators informing the viewer which porn was made to an ethical standard and pay and which were not.
1.4.3. Pro: So long as the participants are well informed of the repercussions and happy with the arrangements/compensation, it is good.
1.4.3.1. Pro: [We should base our morality on informed consent.](https://www.kialo.com/good-and-evil-is-informed-consent-the-determining-factor-of-morality-21075/21075.0=21075.1/=21075.1/comments)
1.4.3.2. Con: This heavily depends in the way of defining good and wrong, if the actions of the participants have bad consequences then it could be seen as [wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism), even if they're well informed of the repercussions and happy with the arrangements.
1.4.4. Pro: [Ethical porn](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ethical-porn/) focuses on treating performers fairly, showing a diverse range of bodies and representing more realistic human interactions.
1.4.4.1. Con: Treating performers fairly is the only requirement for ethical porn. Porn is a fantasy, it doesn't have to accurately reflect reality.
1.5. Pro: Porn gives access to fetishes and habits that would not be accessible otherwise.
1.5.1. Con: It is not immediately clear that this is important, nor more important than the well-being of those who may be negatively affected by the production or consumption of pornography.
1.5.2. Pro: It is healthy for people to explore their sexual preferences and porn is a way for them to do this without having to involve other people.
1.5.3. Pro: It liberates people with their sexuality - they are shown that there are no rights and wrongs.
1.5.3.1. Con: This is the very definition of immorality. Conditioning people to do away with sensibilities concerning right or wrong is the very essence of the unethical.
1.5.3.2. Con: There're rights and wrongs. Having sex with animals, underage people or without consent is understood to be wrong by almost the whole population, whichever view is also supported by legislation. And all of this can be found in porn.
1.6. Con: People can become addicted to pornography which is problematic.
1.6.1. Pro: Pornography is an addictive behavior in which our brain creates a dopamine dependency based around it. Just as gambling is an addictive behavior, pornography becomes addicting in the exact same way.
1.6.2. Pro: There have been numerous studies about behavioural addiction with pornography.

[Neuroscience of Internet Pornography Addiction: A Review and Update](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4600144/)
1.6.3. Con: Many things can cause addiction, yet that does not mean that those activities or substances are bad per se. The abuse of them is.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Drinking coffee is not unethical.
1.6.4. Con: Addiction has nothing to do with ethics, but is rather related to health.
1.6.4.1. Con: An ethical system is conceivable which treats voluntary addictive behaviors as unethical, in that there tend to be social effects which emanate from every addict. For instance, communities with rampant alcoholism experience much higher rates of drunk driving, domestic abuse, suicide, etc.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: There is a credible case to be made that pornography addiction engenders similar sociological effects and behaviors, such as predatory sexual behavior, normalization of gendered objectification, and perhaps extreme antisocial behavior.
1.6.5. Pro: Pornography addiction shows [similar side effects](https://www.projectknow.com/research/porn-addiction/) to alcohol and drug addiction.
1.6.6. Con: People can become addicted to nearly everything, including sex.
1.7. Con: The viewer may begin to objectify people in their life, in a similar fashion as they're shown in pornography.
1.7.1. Con: Studies show that pornography users were more supportive of women [in politics and working outside the home](https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/porn-watchers-think-more-highly-of-women).
1.7.2. Con: That would be an issue with the viewer, not with porn itself.
1.7.3. Con: People watch violent movies and that does not mean they should commit violent acts. If individuals are not able to distinguish fiction in a screen from reality, that is their specific problem.
1.7.3.1. Con: What one should do is a very different concern from the question of what are the psychological consequences of media consumption.
1.7.3.2. Con: The powerful transformative effects of modern media are well-observed. Consuming images of extreme violence and rape very likely have far-reaching effects which we are only beginning to understand beyond the surface level.
1.7.4. Pro: Porn conveys an image of women as subordinate.
1.7.4.1. Con: This is very often the case, but not always. You can find pornography which presents very natural and equal forms of sexuality.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: The domination is much more frequent.
1.7.4.2. Con: There is plenty of porn where women are dominating over men.
1.7.4.2.1. Con: The ratio is far below 50-50%.
1.7.4.3. Con: Most women still do not want men that are "weaker" than them, intellectually or physically speaking.
1.7.4.3.1. Con: Intellectual or physical strength does not necessitate domination.
1.7.4.3.2. Pro: While most men do not have a problem having a partner that is inferior to them, very few women accept partners that are significantly less smart than them. \([1](https://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138%2808%2900079-2/abstract)\) \([2](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/study-confirms-men-are-turned-off-by-a-clever-woman-unless-she-is-beautiful-a7176051.html)\)
1.7.4.3.2.1. Pro: Most women do not accept men whom they have to explain jokes to as partners.
1.7.4.3.2.2. Pro: Women seem to value the ability to have an intellectual exchange at their level more, than men.
1.7.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: Men consider beauty one of the most important factors for mate selection.
1.7.5. Con: Not all objectification is inherently bad. Some people enjoy being objectified during sex.
1.8. Con: One can get demotivated to find a real partner, when they are satisfied by porn. It might be a problem, both personal and social.
1.8.1. Pro: Isolation could allow unhealthy or unethical sexual preferences to develop.
1.8.2. Con: If genuinely satisfied this doesn't present a personal problem. Overpopulation is a concern so the social problem is null.
1.8.3. Con: There is no moral obligation to promote ones personal sexual activity, if we accept your argument we must accept a moral responsibility to mate or procreate. This infringes on autonomy and seems baseless.
1.9. Pro: Porn can be used to improve a couple's sex life.
1.9.1. Pro: The right kind of pornography can entice a couple to try new things, something they couldn't imagine together or felt embarrassed to talk about.
1.9.2. Pro: If one partner has a fetish that the other doesn't want to indulge, masturbation and/or porn could "lighten the burden".
1.9.2.1. Con: If one partner has a harmful fetish that they immerse themselves in while viewing porn they may start to do it to their partner without asking.
1.9.3. Pro: In some cases porn may help with arousal.
1.9.3.1. Con: This has no bearing on whether it is ethical to consume pornography.
1.9.4. Pro: It channels sexual energy and curiosity in a way that does not transgress a monogamous commitment \(as it does not involve sexual activity with any other person\), therefore watching porn enables ethical behaviour in monogamous relationships.
1.10. Con: Watching porn while in a committed relationship is akin to cheating.
1.10.1. Con: Cheating can result in accidental pregnancy or transmission of a STD to the partner, that makes it unethical behavior, as the partner of the cheater is forced to deal with those things. These risks are not a problem when watching porn.
1.10.2. Con: The act of cheating in a relationship is defined by breaking certain established parameters. If both partners agree that watching porn is not one of those parameters it is not considered cheating to do so.
1.10.3. Con: -> See 1.9.4.
1.11. Con: Watching porn might give you a misrepresented image of sex, hence might harm your self-confidence or body image.
1.11.1. Con: Looking at a painting, listening to music might also have this effect.
1.11.2. Con: This is not a reason why watching porn is unethical, it may be a reason that manufacturing this kind of porn is unethical. People can do ethical things which harm them \(like running into a burning building to save a child for example\).
1.12. Pro: Masturbation is natural and beneficial, and porn is a useful masturbation aid.
1.12.1. Con: Whether something aids you has no bearing whatsoever on whether it is ethical in any transpersonal sense.
1.12.2. Pro: Masturbation or "onanism" has been recorded throughout history, young children masturbate, animals masturbate. Sexual self stimulation could be considered a natural part of life for a lot of people. Pornography is ultimately a paraphernalia not a cause, horny people would masturbate via imagination besides ancient humans probably masturbated to cave drawings or venus figurines.
1.12.3. Pro: Masturbation and orgasms have proven to be [stress relief](http://www.besthealthmag.ca/best-you/girlfriends-guide/6-healthy-reasons-to-masturbate/). If a person lacks of partner, porn is an accessible way to relieve stress.
1.12.4. Con: You don't need porn to masturbate. Overconcumption might lead to needing porn to masturbate.
1.12.4.1. Pro: Over-consumption of porn can also lead to [physical and psychological desensitizatio](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/porn-sex-impact-men-health-and-desensitisation-a7449311.html)n of real life sex, causing erectile dysfunction, which may create future relationship problems.
1.12.5. Pro: Frequent ejaculation \(21 times per month\) may result in [lower prostate cancer risk](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319536.php). Porn provides a safe and healthy way of arousing low libido men, encouraging them to ejaculate.
1.13. Con: People working in the porn industry are treated badly, and often exploited.
1.13.1. Con: This isn't always true. Just like other companies, there are those that treat their staff and performers properly and there are those that don't.
1.13.2. Pro: A lot of women are used and abused and manipulated in the porn industry, as in the rest of the sex industry. Thus it enslaves rather than liberates women.
1.13.2.1. Con: A lot of people are used, abused and manipulated in all kinds of industries. There is good reason to suspect that a lot more people are suffering in sweatshops making clothing for example, that does not mean that making clothes is unethical.
1.13.3. Pro: Men suffer for porn, with typically [lower salaries](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/20/porns-dirtiest-secret-what-everyone-gets-paid.html) than female counterparts, leading many [straight male](https://guce.oath.com/collectConsent?brandType=eu&.done=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.co.uk%2Fentry%2Fheres-what-this-straight-man-who-does-gay-for-pay-porn-wants-you-to-know_us_5671cdf3e4b0648fe301fc26%3Fguccounter%3D1&sessionId=3_cc-session_dc5424fc-ae7a-4d43-a6d3-13633116459f&lang=en-gb&inline=false) actors needing to perform [gay porn to pay bills](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0745361/). Also, if there is a failure for a male performer to ejaculate there is often a large fee for another performer to do the deed.
