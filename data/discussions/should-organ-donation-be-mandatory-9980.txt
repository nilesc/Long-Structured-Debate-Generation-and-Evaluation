Discussion Title: Should Organ Donation be Mandatory?

1. Organ donation should be mandatory.
1.1. Pro: Organs can save and transform people's lives, and currently there is a critical shortage.
1.1.1. Con: In part as the medical technology and health of the population improves, and [traffic deaths go down](http://www.elnortedecastilla.es/20140316/local/palencia/donacion-organos-accidentes-trafico-201403161150.html) the number of organ donations reduce.
1.1.2. Pro: There are well over [100,000 people](https://unos.org/data/) living in the US on waitlists for organs. On average 20 will die every day.
1.1.2.1. Con: The USA donation system is not one of the best. There are [plenty of things to improve before mandating organ donations.](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/28/opinions/hill-organ-donor-rules/index.html)
1.1.3. Pro: As well as saving lives, organ donation can transform the quality of someone's life considerably, as shown by this cross-sectional [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15797751) on lung transplantation.
1.1.4. Con: There are critical shortages of many things in this world, from accessible healthcare to clean water: a democracy, however - in tandem with our bodily autonomy - allows us to choose what we do or do not contribute towards.
1.1.5. Pro: The opportunities to study the plentiful supply of tissue will advance medicine much faster, resulting in potentially less death to begin with.
1.1.6. Con: Increasing the lifespan of sick and dying elderly people by providing them youthful body parts puts an extreme strain on the medical system.
1.1.7. Pro: The needs of the living should be prioritised over those of the dead.
1.1.7.1. Con: The decision to donate or to not donate their organs is made by people who are alive.
1.1.7.2. Pro: A dead person gains no value in having their organs, whereas many people could receive extended lifespans by these organs being donated.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: Being as there is no way to know what occurs after death, it cannot be stated as fact that no harm would come to the dead by harvesting their organs.
1.1.7.2.1.1. Con: While we don't know if any harm comes to the deceased from organ removal as we know very little about the afterlife, we do know harm comes to people without receiving organ donation. It is more important to aid those you know you can aid than philosophise over the uncertain party.
1.1.7.2.1.2. Pro: [Romani](http://www.donatelife.gov.au/sites/default/files/Religion_facts.pdf) people believe that the body must remain fully intact after death so that the soul can retrace the steps of the person's life for a year after death.
1.1.7.2.1.2.1. Con: The body doesn't even [deteriorate at the same pace](https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2015/may/05/life-after-death), meaning that even without organ donation it does not remain 'whole' for very long.
1.1.7.2.1.2.1.1. Con: The beliefs of groups of people are no less beliefs because they appear inconsistent or irrational; the benefit or harms of having those beliefs upheld or subjugated is felt by the individual simply by virtue of them believing it.
1.1.7.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Absurdities or inconsistencies within religious factions - such as a desire to keep the body 'whole' postmortem despite the biological impossibility - undermines religious peoples' ability to object. With an issue as important as organ donation, objections need to be based on something more tangible than nebulous and palpably inconsistent religious ideology.
1.1.7.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: From an evolutionary point of view, based on science not absurdities nor inconsistencies, it could be argued, that people who need transplants should die. Giving value to human life is more a religious belief than a demonstrable fact.
1.1.7.2.1.2.2. Con: Religious exemption from mandatory organ donation could be implemented.
1.1.7.2.1.3. Con: We do know precisely what happens after death: the body decomposes. Seeing that reanimation and/or zombies are not commonplace, one can assert with reasonable certainty that the dead are not going to be harmed by any lack of vital organs.
1.1.7.2.1.4. Con: If we are looking at the 'spirit' or 'soul' somehow coming to harm, this is patently absurd; quite clearly, if there is some intangible element of a person that exists after their demise, it is not an element that requires a physical body any longer. As such, harvesting organs from the cast-off body of a now formless spirit will cause no harm whatsoever.
1.1.7.2.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.2.1.2.1.
1.1.7.2.2. Con: Since a person owns their own body, they may pass that ownership along to family members in their will. Just as one might leave a house to their children, one might leave their body which could be a valuable asset if people were allowed to sell body parts in such circumstances. Higher prices might be awarded for parts from people who lived healthier lives.
1.1.7.2.3. Con: Whilst a dead person can gain no benefits from keeping their organs, a living person may feel great pain and disgust at the prospect of their body being desecrated upon their death.
1.1.7.2.3.1. Con: This is selfish, irresponsible and immature; a body is an empty vessel after death, and one's personal discomfort cannot and should not affect the lives of others. The state, therefore, should not support nor encourage such choices.
1.1.7.2.3.1.1. Con: Adherents of some religions may believe that the fate of their eternal soul could be compromised by mandatory organ donation. It would be grossly unfair and cruel to force them to endure this prospect for most of their lives.
1.1.7.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.2.1.2.
1.1.7.2.3.1.1.2. Con: Ultimately, the salient question here is whether we respect human life, or human beliefs, more than the other. Given that the former is unquestionable, while the latter is subjective and arguably disprovable, it would seem to make substantially more sense to place emphasis on the preservation and continuation of human life than transient belief systems.
1.1.7.2.3.1.1.2.1. Con: The decision to 'value' or 'respect' human lives is an assumed or subjective belief, just as religious beliefs are
1.1.7.2.3.1.1.2.2. Con: The answer to this question is subjective to the person of whom it is being asked; as such, the person whose organs are in question should be the one to make that choice for themselves.
1.1.7.2.3.1.1.3. Con: Most major world religions look [favourably](http://www.donatelife.gov.au/sites/default/files/Religion_facts.pdf) on organ donation.
1.1.7.2.3.1.1.3.1. Con: Even if the religions which ban donating organs are small, they have the same right to be respected.
1.1.7.2.3.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Only respecting the rights of the majority undermines the validity of rights as a concept.
1.1.7.2.3.1.1.3.1.2. Con: There are some compulsory aspects of life that cannot be dodged: taxation, for example, which regardless of one's personal political or religious convictions must be paid all the same. It is just as absurd for religions to be exempt from organ donation as it would be for religions to be exempt from tax.
1.1.7.2.3.1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Many churches and religious organisations are [exempt from paying taxes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2015/09/22/lets-tax-churches/#6ec2eaa9322b). There is a precedent for religious bodies being afforded certain rights that other organisations don't have.
1.1.7.2.3.1.1.3.1.2.2. Con: Bodily autonomy is more fundamental a right than the right to private property in the case of taxation; there is no question over whether or not an individual owns their body, whereas the degree to which an individual can own possessions or have to pay taxes to the state is based on varying conceptualisations of rights and even ideologies.
1.1.7.2.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: Indeed, many [actively encourage it](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/religion-organ-donation).
1.1.7.2.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.7.2.1.
1.1.7.2.3.2. Con: Corpses are generally burned to ash or left underground to decompose; hardly a cheerful thought at the best of times, and is another form of desecration. The least one can do is not waste accessible resources, especially if the concern is due to a specific form of desecration that individuals may find discomfiting.
1.1.7.2.3.3. Con: This is clearly an absurd standard to which to hold bodily autonomy.
1.1.7.3. Con: No one has a right to life at the cost of another life.  No one has the right to someone's property after their death if they are not in the will of the person.  A poor person may *need* our house when we die, but we get a choice as to what will happen to said house.
1.2. Con: Availability or demand for organs might affect medical efforts and spending for those still living whose organs are desired. A conflict of interest is generated.
1.2.1. Pro: Many people - [around 12%](https://nhsbtdbe.blob.core.windows.net/umbraco-assets-corp/6103/od-key-stats-grid-dec-2017.pdf) - fear that doctors will not do enough to try to save them if they are organ donors, as their organs could save more lives than if they themselves were saved.
1.2.1.1. Con: Organ donor organisations are [not involved](https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/59pj7q/no-doctors-wont-let-you-die-because-youre-an-organ-donor) in the end-of-life care process, and cannot influence doctors to treat organ donors differently.
1.2.1.2. Con: These fears have been declared a "legend" and debunked in detail by [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/donor-demised/).
1.2.1.2.1. Con: A fear being irrational does not mean that the fear does not exist; many people believe the myth regardless of it being a myth.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: In the article, they talk about a case that the doctor forced the death of the patient.
1.2.1.2.3. Con: This claim is false, by its own source as well as other news outlets. This case was very highly publicized in [2008](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/us/27transplant.html), with the doctor winning the lawsuits that followed.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Doctors know of the persistent high demand for organs and that one individual's organs could save many lives, even if they do not know the exact individuals whose lives would be saved.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: The conflict of interest is generated from the discrepancy between supply and demand. If the supply vastly outstrips demand then the conflict of interest never presents. If donation is mandatory, there would be an abundance of organs available. The problem exists because organ donation isn't mandatory.
1.2.1.4. Con: Fears of the ignorant masses are a political barrier, not a counter argument.
1.2.2. Con: Medical professionals still have codes of conduct and are held accountable in the case of mistakes or problems; the mistrust is due to a lack of knowledge on the subject, and can therefore be remedied with [publicised information](http://www.donatelife.gov.au/myths-and-misconceptions).
1.2.2.1. Con: If people distrust medical professionals, then information that necessarily will come from that source is unlikely to alleviate that distrust.
1.2.3. Pro: In many instances, a person would have to remain on life support to be able to go through all [tests required](https://www.giftoflife.on.ca/resources/pdf/FAQ_for_HP_\(fact_sheet\)_EN.pdf) for organ donation, including instances where the potential donor is in pain, undergoing seizures, etc. Mandatory organ donation in these cases would cause the donor more harm and suffering.
1.2.4. Con: Medical professionals have a duty to treat and save their patients, not a duty or any external pressure to produce organs for other patients.
1.2.5. Con: Most doctors' charts do not record the patient's donor status or display it prominently. This information is usually sought as an afterthought, when the patient is terminal. Therefore it is unlikely to affect treatment in elective situations.
1.2.6. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.
1.2.7. Pro: Mandatory tissue collection may open doors for other laws or case laws to circumvent the consenting process.
1.2.8. Pro: This fosters a mistrust in the medical profession which will lead to people failing to get treatment.
1.2.8.1. Con: Yet, such people are unlikely to have qualms about accepting organs should they require it; this is a matter of perspective and understanding.
1.2.8.2. Con: If seeking somebody to distrust, it would be more prudent to distrust the government/legal forces behind such a move; medical professionals may advise, but the ultimate decision would be enshrined in law.
1.2.8.3. Pro: People value [autonomy](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/03/people-want-power-because-they-want-autonomy/474669/) and when they perceive the medical industry as infringing on that, they are less likely to have a positive relationship with that industry.
1.2.8.4. Pro: The pretense that there is clear distinction between "alive" and "dead" is false. There is too much gray space in the distinction to make such a grave assertion as a legal mandate.
1.2.8.4.1. Con: The [medical profession](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952109/) seems to be less divided on this issue: "There is uniform agreement on the clinical neurological examination to evaluate absence of brain function. This examination includes the assessment of coma, the absence of brain reflexes, and the assessment of apnea."
1.2.8.4.2. Pro: In 1995, only 1 percent of dead donors nationwide were DCD \("donation after cardiac death"\) donors. That figure [increased](http://sm.stanford.edu/archive/stanmed/2011spring/article5.html) to almost 11 percent in 2008. This could raise ethical concerns about the definition of cardiac death becoming more relaxed.
1.2.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.2.8.6. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.3. Pro: More organs will reduce the demand for harmful black market alternatives.
1.3.1. Pro: Black market organ sales have no regulation, making their use extremely unsafe.
1.3.2. Pro: The organ black market often exploits disadvantaged people.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Traffickers in poorer countries have been known to coerce impoverished individuals into [selling their organs](https://borgenproject.org/organ-trafficking-and-the-poor/) for very low prices and without proper aftercare.
1.3.3. Con: Black market efforts can shift to expedite release of desired donable organs. Potential donors can no longer opt out, and this places them at increased risk.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Rare organs and bloodtype combinations could lead to an exploitative murder market due to the 'knowledge' that the deceased will be harvested, regardless of how she ended up in that state. For example: I need an AB- heart from a 25 year old. I employ a criminal to 'accidentally' kill one, who is then harvested to fill my need of a 25 year old AB- heart.
1.3.4. Con: Due to increase in longevity and disease rates, the demand for organs will always [exceed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4513003/) the supply of organs so people who can afford to purchase black market organs will still have the incentive to do so rather than take their chances waiting on the donor list.
1.3.4.1. Con: Whilst this is true, an increase in the supply of legal organs would still mean less demand on the black market, meaning that less of the abuses associated with it would occur.
1.3.5. Con: Black market alternatives are very rare because they are insanely highly illegal.  Making transplants easy increases the [odds of crimes](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5637687) and it make prosecution difficult.
1.3.6. Con: Voluntary sale of one's own organs would also reduce the demand for black market alternatives as well as State violence resultant from mandates.
1.4. Con: Mandatory organ donation is unethical and damaging.
1.4.1. Pro: Mandatory organ donation stands counter to core tenets of many religions, and would hence violate religious freedom.
1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.2.3.1.1.
1.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.2.1.2.
1.4.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.7.2.3.1.1.3.
1.4.1.4. Con: A dead body does not have the right to religious freedom. That right can only apply to someone who consciously chooses to practice a religion.
1.4.1.5. Pro: Many branches of [Judaism](https://www.jlaw.com/Articles/brain.html) oppose the taking of organs from someone who has suffered brain death if their heart is still beating.
1.4.1.5.1. Con: This is far from universal: 'Jews believe that if it is possible to donate an organ to save a life, [it is obligatory](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/religion-organ-donation) to do so'.
1.4.1.5.2. Con: Only the donation of an organ without an identified recipient is prohibited, as this condition doesn't fall under [pikuach nefesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikuach_nefesh).
1.4.1.5.3. Con: This view is only held by some Ultra-Orthodox fractions these days, while the [official position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation_in_Jewish_law) of Chief Rabbinate and the State of Israel is to consider brain death with heartbeat as equivalent to cessation of life.
1.4.1.6. Pro: Most people of the [Shinto](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/shinto/shintoethics/organs.shtml) faith oppose organ donation.
1.4.1.7. Pro: The decision to donate organs is a personal as well as religious issue among many people. Thus, by making donating organs mandatory, health care facilities would face many protests.
1.4.1.8. Con: The right to religious freedom should be violated if not doing so means that people die unnecessarily.
1.4.2. Pro: Mandatory organ donation adversely affects the bereaved loved ones of a person who has recently died.
1.4.2.1. Con: The negative effect on the bereaved loved ones of the dead organ donor is preferable to the bereavement of the loved ones of the [8 people's lives](http://www.liveonny.org/about-donation/quick-facts-about-donation/) that the organ donor could have saved.
1.4.2.2. Con: Corpses have been treated in different ways since the birth of humanity: burned, buried, embalmed, mummified, the list is endless and socially relative. Families may, at present, find organ donation difficult to cope with; as society shifts, this approach is equally likely to shift.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: The bereaved loved ones will still experience emotional harm between now and when the cultural norms shift. It is unfair of the state to mandate that they go through this, even if there is change decades down the line.
1.4.2.3. Pro: The death of a loved one makes people feel powerless and like they have no control over life. Allowing people to choose whether or not to donate the organs of their loved one can give them a sense of control back.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: In the status quo families often don't have the power to decide whether or not organs are donated anyway. It is entirely contingent on whether the person in question opted in \(or opted out depending on the system they lived under\) to organ donation during their lives.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: In many countries families override the bodily autonomy of donors by choosing whether or not organs are donated.
1.4.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: In countries such as Ireland, people can decide to have their [next of kin's](https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/organdonation/organprocurementservice/organ-donation-leaflet-english.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiowILkqN_ZAhVEI8AKHdnoCDwQFjAMegQIBxAB&usg=AOvVaw24Ii6w1g6QW66m5SjfA_e_) organs donated. A lack of bodily autonomy is already status quo in many places.
1.4.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The spirit of the law is to preserve the bodily autonomy of the individual; the lack of a better way for doing it doesn't dismiss that the right of bodily autonomy must be preserved.
1.4.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: In the [UK](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/15/nhs-moves-to-stop-bereaved-families-blocking-donation-of-relatives-organs), families can even override the decisions of registered donors.
1.4.2.4. Pro: Loved ones may be put under pressure to take their loved one off a ventilator in order to have them become a [donor after cardiac death](http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/transplant/nonlivingdonors/nonliving_after_cardiac.html).
1.4.2.5. Con: The grief felt at the loss of family or friends could be mitigated by the knowledge that another person - along with that person's friends and family - has been spared that same grief.
1.4.2.5.1. Pro: This has been [proven true](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/children/10899012/Organ-donation-The-family-who-turned-their-grief-into-the-gift-of-life.html) in [several cases](http://www.itv.com/news/2017-09-08/13-year-old-girl-saves-eight-lives-as-highest-ever-organ-donor/), with family members finding 'peace' and 'comfort' in knowing others have been able to live.
1.4.2.5.1.1. Con: In both these cases the families in question consented to the organ donation. They may well have felt differently had their loved ones' organs been taken away without them having any say.
1.4.2.5.2. Con: If families feel like donating their loved one's organs would allow them this relief then they can choose to do so. Mandatory organ donations mean that families who do not feel this way do not get to decide for themselves.
1.4.2.5.3. Con: The grief could be exacerbated by the knowledge that their loved one's body could be perceived as desecrated. Grief is a highly subjective emotional experience with no guaranteed responses.
1.4.3. Pro: Taking away the voluntary component lessens the value of the selfless act of donating an organ.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Currently the families of the deceased can draw considerable [comfort](https://news.sky.com/story/it-was-her-wish-to-live-on-daughters-organs-saved-eight-lives-11167348) from knowing that the deceased person selflessly saved lives with their decision to donate organs. Compulsion robs them of that decision, and thus robs the families of that comfort.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Compulsion would enable many more lives to be saved. We should ultimately value those lives over a marginal amount of comfort that some families may feel.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: Most of the comfort in such a situation comes from the knowledge that in their death the deceased was able to help another person or people, regardless of whether or not this help was a choice. More families will now have access to that comfort once organ donation becomes mandatory, as the organs of more people will ultimately enter the system.
1.4.3.2. Con: The tangible value of the organ, i.e. how much benefit it offers the person it is donated to, remains the same regardless of whether the donation was selfless or not.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Suspecting that the donor was not willing to donate may cause moral conflict in the recipient of the organ.
1.4.3.4. Con: The value of being selfless is primarily felt by the person carrying out the selfless act. A person who donates their organs after they die derives no such value as they are dead.
1.4.4. Con: This will normalise tissue donation and thus encourage people to donate tissue when they are alive.
1.4.4.1. Pro: The government mandating organ donation can act as a signalling effect, implicitly encouraging organ donation as a general benefit for society which makes living people more likely to donate.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Conversely, making it compulsory can engender resentment in some people against the whole idea of organ donation.
1.4.4.2. Con: This is pure speculation, as there has been no noticeable increase in [living tissue donation](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/blood_tissues_organs/docs/ev_20141126_factsfigures_en.pdf) in countries like Austria, where their opt-out policy has normalised organ donation.
1.4.4.3. Con: Despite the attempted normalisation of blood donation, less than [10% of people](http://www.centralbloodbank.org/donate-blood/facts) do so.
1.4.4.4. Con: Organ donation after death does not inconvenience the person who has died, unlike tissue donation during life which is an inconvenience and [risk](http://www.kidneylink.org/RisksInvolvedinLivingDonation.aspx) a person must choose to undertake. It is unlikely that people knowing their organs will be donated after death will impact their decision making regarding actively donating tissue while alive.
1.4.4.5. Pro: Several organs are easily accessible and collected while the person is alive. Blood and its other fluid compartments are by definition an organ, while another would be skin tissue.
1.4.4.6. Pro: The ever-growing acceptability of [blood donations](http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Health-systems/blood-safety/news/news/2012/06/rising-blood-donation-rates-in-europe) suggests that, as such procedures become a 'norm', individuals may be prepared to go out of their way to assist.
1.5. Pro: Mandatory donation will simplify the procedures after death leading to fewer organs being needlessly wasted.
1.5.1. Pro: [Often](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/77452336/Potential-organ-donors-being-blocked-by-family-and-doctors-says-audit), perhaps due to prioritising other discussions at a very sensitive time, doctors do not even discuss organ donation with the families of potential donors.
1.5.2. Pro: There are many reasons people don't donate their organs or their next of kin's organs that don't involve being opposed to organ donation. Mandatory organ donation solves those instances.
1.5.2.1. Con: [Presumed consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation#Consent_process) would capture all reasons people fail to donate organs, apart from an opposition to organ donation. Thus it solves this problem without undermining the choice not to donate.
1.5.2.2. Pro: Most people support organ donation in theory but never get around to [registering](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/nudge-theory-richard-thaler-meaning-explanation-what-is-it-nobel-economics-prize-winner-2017-a7990461.html) as a donor.
1.5.2.3. Pro: Many people don't know their next of kin's stance on whether or not they want their organs to be donated after they die, as it is unpleasant to contemplate the death of a loved one so many avoid the subject entirely.
1.5.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.5.
1.5.2.3.2. Con: This is a level of both selfishness and cowardice; all humans die, and to circumnavigate the discussion - potentially at the cost of another person's life - is unacceptable.
1.5.2.4. Pro: Sometimes it is as arbitrary as 'creeping people out'; [eyes and hearts](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8615320.stm) are some of the most commonly opted-out organs for donations, despite the massive good they could do.
1.5.2.5. Pro: Despite cultural and economic development similarities, with an opt-in system Germany has an organ donation consent rate of 12%, [while Austria](http://webs.wofford.edu/pechwj/Do%20Defaults%20Save%20Lives.pdf) has 99.9% with an opt-out system. This provides strong support for the "[default effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_effect)".
1.5.3. Con: With an increased supply of organs, there is less need to be extremely careful with these organs and waste is more likely to occur.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Donated blood, a far more common procedure, has a wastage rate of [around 10%](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13496536.Ten_per_cent_of_donated_blood_is__wasted_/); the same rates could well apply to valuable organs.
1.5.3.2. Con: Due to increase in longevity and disease rates, the demand for organs will always [exceed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4513003/) the supply of eligible donor organs meaning there is always an incentive to be careful with each organ.
1.5.3.3. Pro: When it is easier to replace an organ that is mishandled before transplant than it was previously, the consequences for mishandling \(i.e. a patient dying from being unable to receive the mishandled organ\) become less extreme and thereby lessens the incentive to minimise waste.
1.5.4. Con: Forced donation would increase the organ pool but testing each tissue for STIs and matching organs to recipient’s immune system would be labor intensive. An entire industry would have to be formed to screen tissues and match recipients. Without it, we will find ourselves unnecessarily collecting tissues to find them unusable or run out of time to use them.
1.5.5. Pro: Forced donation for healthcare will allow an additional opportunity for unusable tissues \(such as non-matching organ to recipient immune system or organs carrying STIs like Hep C\) to be collected by researchers. The increase in available material will benefit science.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Even sick and damaged organs can have major benefit to science and in understanding human pathology, thus saving even more lives.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: There is nothing to prevent people from using a collected tissue for other reasons than a transplant, which raises ethical concerns.
1.5.6. Con: Switching to a system that rapidly increases organ donation rates requires appropriate changes in the medical system, including more resources such as hospital reimbursements for organ storage and employing in-hospital transplant coordinators, as exemplified by the [Spanish system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673610613426?via%3Dihub).
1.6. Con: Mandatory organ donation infringes a person's right to bodily autonomy.
1.6.1. Con: Given that families can already override bodily autonomy it makes sense to have an ultimate override.
1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.3.1.1.
1.6.1.2. Con: Families can typically only override autonomy if the person did not explicitly \(living will\) request something else while able to think clearly.  Families do not get to override living wills as long as the person made preparations that enable them to be reasonably executed \(e.g. pre-paying\).
1.6.2. Pro: People may be worried about specific organs such as their private parts being used, as there are now examples of successful [uterus](http://www.clevelandclinic.org/lp/uterus-transplant/index.html) and [penis](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/health/thomas-manning-first-penis-transplant-in-us.html) transplants.
1.6.3. Pro: Procuring body parts by force violates the basic [principles of non-aggression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle).
1.6.3.1. Pro: The most basic possession one has is their body. It is their right as a human not to have this taken by force. It is their right to have it cared for in culturally and legally acceptable means of their choice after death.
1.6.3.2. Con: The principle of non aggression is routinely violated in order to enforce laws vital to the running of society. Taxation, minimum wage laws and laws against pollution all in some way depend upon aggression or threatened aggression.
1.6.4. Con: Dead people cannot exercise their bodily autonomy.
1.6.4.1. Con: Living people can exercise their right to determine how they wish their remains to be treated, same as their property.
1.6.4.2. Pro: The autonomy of the body automatically gets transferred [to the family of the deceased](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/wills-and-probate/content/100635). In case there is no one to decide for the body, the state should take care of the organs and the rest of the body.
1.6.4.3. Con: Bodily autonomy should not be linked to the person's ability to claim this right. Otherwise, even sleeping and unconscious persons or babies would have no right to physical integrity.
1.6.5. Pro: Employing coercion to steal one's property \(in this case, their organs/tissue\) is immoral and unjust. Nobody but an individual \(or their rightful heirs, once deceased\) has a legitimate claim to their property. Therefore, any use of Governmental dictate or intervention to satisfy the "demand" for organs/tissue is inherently immoral and unjust.
1.6.6. Con: -> See 1.1.7.
1.6.7. Pro: The right to bodily autonomy does not end upon death.
1.6.7.1. Con: All other rights of a person end upon death; a dead person is not a citizen and does not have rights.
1.6.7.2. Con: After a couple of days after a person's death, all of the vital organs in the body quickly decay and start rotting, and become unusable. Nature will take the organs away anyways, so we don't take away something that would otherwise remain to the dead person: they will be gone anyways.
1.6.7.3. Con: The concept of autonomy requires the existence of the individual will. Upon death, the will is no longer present in the body and it is in effect an inanimate object, so it is completely meaningless to say that bodily autonomy can outlast life.
1.6.7.3.1. Con: Some [belief systems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy) hold that the dead body is not simply inert matter and [deserves respect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relic). Treating it with respect satisfies a [religious](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/5195466/Muslims-and-Jews-to-be-allowed-to-have-different-post-mortems.html) need.
1.6.7.3.2. Con: Soldiers die trying to make sure the bodies of the fallen are returned to their families. To them the bodies have meaning, they are not just inanimate objects.
1.6.7.3.3. Con: Some belief systems hold that the dead body is not simply inert matter and [deserves respect](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/11/why-humans-care-for-the-bodies-of-the-dead/415425/). Treating it with respect satisfies a [psychological](https://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=7287) need. \(World Health Organization - [PDF](http://Management of Dead Bodies in Disaster Situations - World Health Organization PDFWorld Health Organization › techguidance)\)
1.6.7.4. Pro: Upon somebody's death, we respect their wishes with regard to what should be done with their property because their ownership of it is a manifestation of their autonomy that exists beyond death, even though it would be more beneficial to society as a whole to simply redistribute it evenly. We should recognise the same principle with regard to people's bodies.
1.6.8. Pro: The prospect of forced organ donation at death can have negative influence on a person's life while they are alive. To compromise bodily autonomy at death, therefore, is to in effect compromise it during life.
1.6.8.1. Con: For some people it can have a positive effect to know they are granting life to others.
1.6.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.2.3.
1.6.9. Con: Infringing upon bodily autonomy can be justified in certain instances if it facilitates the greater good through alleviating harm and suffering. Mandatory organ donation is one such instance since it can save many lives.
1.6.9.1. Con: This assumes universal conceptions of the greater good, harm, and suffering which do not exist.
1.6.9.1.1. Con: Health systems are adept at using measure of predicted universal harm and suffering, for example New Zealand basis its decision to fund therapeutics on [Quality Adjusted Life Years](https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/economic-assessment-guide.pdf).
1.6.9.1.2. Con: Even in the absence of universal triggers of suffering and harm the experience of harm, suffering, and benefit are universal. This can be quantified through metrics like Quality Adjusted Life Years \([QALYs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year)\).
1.6.9.2. Pro: People have certain rights, like the right to freedom, infringed upon when society is better off for that, such as when a convicted criminal is put into prison.
1.6.9.3. Pro: Taxation enables the state to take money from people that they have often earned through their own labour, and whether they consent or not, so as to provide essential services such as protection and education. This is justifiable because it provides such a profound benefit to the overall public good, in the same way mandatory organ donation would through saving lives.
1.6.10. Con: It is morally inconsistent to defend the bodily autonomy of the dead while failing to defend the bodily autonomy of the living, as is the case in countries without accessible abortion.
1.6.10.1. Con: This is an argument to be more consistent in preserving bodily autonomy for the living rather than abolishing it for the dead.
1.6.10.2. Con: Morality is, by its nature, individual.  Access to abortion is grounded in the belief that a person should have a choice that is not overridden by the beliefs of others.
1.7. Con: There are alternatives to mandatory organ donation.
1.7.1. Pro: ["Opt-out"](https://sparq.stanford.edu/solutions/opt-out-policies-increase-organ-donation) organ donation systems have proven effective in countries such as Austria.
1.7.1.1. Con: Opt-out systems are certainly better than opt-in systems, but there remains the possibility that somebody could miss out on a life saving organ transplant on account of too many people opting out. This is unacceptable.
1.7.1.2. Pro: The Dutch system recently [changed](https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2018/02/new-dutch-organ-donation-law-will-apply-to-everyone-officially-registered-in-nl/) from opt-in to opt-out. This is another datapoint for the future.
1.7.1.3. Pro: As opting out takes some effort, the number of available organ donors is still likely to be significantly larger than with an opt-in system. In practice, the equilibrium number of people remaining on the organ donor list may be sufficient to meet the demand.
1.7.1.3.1. Pro: This allows people to exercise freedom of choice and would avoid violating religious freedom.
1.7.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.5.3.2.
1.7.1.4. Con: "Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain the variation in organ donation rates between different countries. A combination of legislation, availability of donors, transplantation system organisation and infrastructure, wealth and investment in health care, as well as underlying public attitudes to and awareness of organ donation and transplantation, may all play a role, although the relative importance of each is not clear." \[from a systematic [review](https://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/hta/hta13260/#/abstract) on presumed consent in organ donation\]
1.7.1.5. Con: Despite having one of the most successful opt-out organ donation programmes in the world, Spain still has [10% mortality rate](http://www.ont.es/informacion/Paginas/Trasplante.aspx) for those on the transplant waiting list.
1.7.1.5.1. Con: This mortality is more easily translated to the [lack of investment in the public health system](https://www.elconfidencial.com/economia/2016-10-11/salud-sanidad-recortes-espana-ue-pib-informe_1273294/), not to [the lack of organs](http://www.elmundo.es/ciencia-y-salud/salud/2017/09/08/59b27d0246163fa37c8b45ec.html).
1.7.1.5.2. Con: This is still quite substantially lower than most other countries; in the UK, for example, around a quarter of all those waiting for lung transplants over the last ten years [have died](https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/news-and-campaigns/news/nhs-blood-and-transplant-reveals-nearly-49-000-people-in-the-uk-have-had-to-wait-for-a-transplant-in-the-last-decade/).
1.7.1.6. Con: -> See 1.5.6.
1.7.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.5.
1.7.2. Con: All alternative systems yield fewer organs than a compulsory system, thus still leave some people to die.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Spain, which is the world leader in organ transplants and uses an opt-out system, still has a [wait time](http://www.tenerifenews.com/2016/03/patients-waiting-for-transplant-face-shortest-time-in-spain/) for organs varying from three months to one and a half years \(depending on which organ is needed\).
1.7.2.1.1. Con: Finding compatible organs is difficult and most organs aren't transplanted not due to lack of consent, but due to lack of compatibility.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: Donated organs need to match a [series of criteria](https://organdonor.gov/about/process/matching.html) in order to be viable for transplant. More organs available does not mean they will fit the criteria to be of most use.
1.7.2.1.2. Con: Spain has health care problems, one of which is having[long queues for an operating room](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/sociedad/20171204/vuelve-a-subir-el-tiempo-medio-de-espera-para-ser-operado-en-espana-6471570).
1.7.2.2. Con: The alternative systems can be seen as necessary first steps in the right direction. Jumping straight to an extreme compulsory system may be quicker, but a steady path to compulsory donation may be more likely to succeed.
1.7.3. Pro: Technological and scientific advances offer a possible solution.
1.7.3.1. Pro: It would be better to focus energies \(and money\) on [artificial organs](https://futurism.com/artificial-organs-entering-era-transplants-obsolete/), be they grown via stem cell research or 3D printed.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Xenotransplantation technologies relying on [blastocyst complementation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3607052/) \(generating transplantable human organs from the patient's own cells in lifestock animals\) may reduce the need for human donors in the future.
1.7.3.3. Con: This may well be true, but we should still implement mandatory organ donation until this technology is fully viable.
1.7.3.3.1. Pro: We should not allow the pressure on the current organ donation system build up in the off-chance that a better, more effective solution may be found in the future. Mandatory donation can ease that pressure relatively quickly.
1.7.4. Pro: Systems exist which consider whether someone is a donor themselves when assessing their priority for an organ transplant.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Until 2016, there used to be a private organ donation network in the US: [LifeSharers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LifeSharers). By agreeing to donate their organs to the network, members received priority in receiving organs from other members of the network.
1.7.4.2. Pro: Israel has a policy of [prioritising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation_in_Israel) organ donation to individuals, or families, who are themselves organ donors or on the organ donor registry.
1.7.4.3. Con: Organ donation should be prioritised to aid those in the greatest need, not those who were fortunate enough for either themselves or their relatives to be healthy enough or willing enough to donate organs.
1.7.4.3.1. Con: It is a [serious misconception](http://www.donatelife.gov.au/myths-and-misconceptions) to assume that one has to be in excellent health to be able to donate organs: those who smoke, drink, and/or have unhealthy lifestyles will [almost always](https://nhsbtdbe.blob.core.windows.net/umbraco-assets-corp/6103/od-key-stats-grid-dec-2017.pdf) be able to donate some or all organs.
1.7.4.3.2. Con: It is possible to adjust systems to make exceptions for those who cannot donate through no fault of their own by granting them the same status as those who choose to register as donors. Only those who have viable organs but choose not to register need to be at a disadvantage for the system to work effectively.
1.7.5. Pro: People could be financially incentivised to donate their organs.
1.7.5.1. Pro: In 1988, Iran started paying kidney donors and 11 years later the transplant waiting list [was cleared](https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/12/organ-sales).
1.7.5.2. Pro: Some US states provide [tax incentives](https://www.kidney.org/sites/default/files/LDTaxDed_Leave.pdf) for organ donation.
