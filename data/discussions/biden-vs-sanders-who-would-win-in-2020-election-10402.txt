Discussion Title: Biden vs. Sanders: Who Would Win In 2020 Election?

1. Joe Biden will defeat Bernie Sanders in a 2020 election.
1.1. Pro: The DNC is likely to give Biden more support in the primaries than Sanders.
1.1.1. Pro: Biden has dominated Sanders in recent polls, though it's early.
1.1.1.1. Pro: According to [recent data](http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/369555-poll-biden-holds-double-digit-lead-over-field-of-2020-dem-presidential) from Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll, Joe Biden has 27% of the Democratic vote, in comparison to 16% for Bernie Sanders.
1.1.2. Pro: Democrats will view Biden as "more electable" in majority-white working class areas like the Midwest.
1.2. Con: Bernie Sanders is currently the most popular active politician in America. [thehill.com](http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/329404-poll-bernie-sanders-countrys-most-popular-active-politician)
1.3. Con: Biden rejects Universal Basic Income, which is a popular measure and fixes the inherent issues with welfare state that keep people trapped in poverty. [sppa.udel.edu](https://www.sppa.udel.edu/bideninstitute/research-policy/biden-institute-blog/Let’s-Choose-a-Future-That-Puts-Work-First)
1.4. Con: On foreign policy, Biden is more of a war hawk, and this is likely to disadvantage him. [www.huffingtonpost.com](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-zunes/bidens-hawkish-record_b_214873.html)
1.4.1. Pro: Compared to Biden, Sanders is largely seen as a dove, strictly anti-war. This will be seen as far more attractive across party lines to a war weary populace, making Sanders the overall stronger candidate for a General Election.

1.5. Pro: Russian interference \(which would likely be pro-Sanders\) would be easier to detect, deter and condemn in 2020
1.5.1. Con: There is no evidence to suggest any outside election interference would be targeted to help Sanders. We can only conclude that any purported interference in 2016 was specifically anti-HRC because she is a war hawk.
1.6. Con: Biden doesn't see a moral conflict in the current class divides of America. This leaves him open to sincere to criticism to the growing number of socialist minded millennial \(now the largest voting block in US\).

1.6.1. Pro: This leaves Biden open to honest and fair criticisms about his view of morality with regards to wealth accumulation by left leaning publications. [www.currentaffairs.org](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/06/its-basically-just-immoral-to-be-rich)
1.7. Con: The most progressive magazine in the US will likely not endorse Biden, as they see him as not having learned the lessons of 2016, and of still being cut from the same establishment cloth as HRC.

1.7.1. Con: The Nation didn’t endorse Hillary either, and she won the primaries.
1.8. Pro: Joe Biden would win the same states that Hillary Clinton won. Bernie Sanders lacks sufficient support of African-Americans .
1.9. Pro: Sanders has had [difficulty](http://inthesetimes.com/article/19020/why-arent-more-black-voters-supporting-bernie-sanders) attracting Black voters.
1.9.1. Con: Sanders only had trouble attracting Black votes because the DNC front loaded southern primaries before he had a chance to be well known.
1.9.2. Con: Now that ample time has passed for people to get to know Sanders, he is the most popular politician amongst Black voters, with a 73% favorability rating.

1.9.3. Con: In the deep south, Sanders has become beloved among African Americans. [nymag.com](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/04/what-really-happened-when-bernie-sanders-went-to-mississippi.html)
1.10. Con: Biden attacked Clinton at times.
1.11. Con: Sanders will still be very strong among independent liberals.
1.11.1. Pro: Thirty-nine percent of Americans identify as [independent](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/05/5-facts-about-americas-political-independents/), while only 34% identify as Democrat. From this perspective, Sanders who [identifies as an independent](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/10/23/bernie-sanders-i-am-an-independent/792186001/) could win.
1.11.2. Pro: With Biden positioning himself specifically as anti-populist, and anti-bernie, he will have a difficult time luring liberal independents, and convincing Bernie's largely energetic base to support him. [thenation.com](https://www.thenation.com/article/joe-biden-positions-himself-as-the-anti-bernie/)
1.12. Pro: Biden is a man. Sanders' predominantly male support base might find a male less hostile to them than a female \(Hillary Clinton\), thus reducing enthusiasm
