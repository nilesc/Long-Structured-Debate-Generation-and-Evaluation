Discussion Title: Should "women-only" spaces be open to anyone identifying as female?

1. "Women-only" spaces should be open to anyone identifying as female.
1.1. Con: Women-only spaces have traditionally focused on issues that affect cis women. This tradition should be preserved for its own sake.
1.1.1. Con: This is because traditionally it was assumed sex and gender were the same. We now understand that being a women is not to do with your sex so 'women only' spaces should adapt to cater for this.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Spaces and social norms typically evolve when there is a greater understanding of something. Preserving tradition for its own sake merely preserves outdated information.
1.1.2. Pro: A modern example of a women-only space is the [lactation room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation_room).
1.1.2.1. Con: Although there are women only spaces which exclusively exist for things only biological women can do, such as lactate, the majority of women-only spaces are spaces to discuss women's issues, something which trans women have experience with, thus denying them entry into women-only spaces invalidates their experiences as women and marginalizes them further
1.1.2.2. Con: Some trans women can in fact lactate. There is a spectrum of biological gender too, and some people who were identified as biologically male at birth do in fact have the ability to lactate naturally.
1.1.3. Pro: Certain women-only spaces have existed for many years and may want to honour their own traditions, for example [Turkish Baths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_bath#Function:_gendered_social_space).
1.2. Con: "Women-only" spaces should include non-binary people as well.
1.2.1. Pro: Often non-binary people are placed in a difficult position and generally over-looked by the general population, leaving them severely [marginalised](https://thebodyisnotanapology.com/magazine/a-chronology-violence-against-women-when-youre-not-a-woman/). Women-spaces would offer this group a rare chance to be be part of a community.
1.2.1.1. Con: This claim applies to every marginalized group. Being marginalized is not a criterium for admittance to women only spaces.
1.2.1.2. Con: This reduces the experience of being non-binary people as it assumes that they are similar to women when for non-binary people they definitionally do not identify as women.
1.2.2. Con: It would make more sense for non-binary people to create their own spaces.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Like women-only spaces, non-binary people could discuss the issues they face, without misunderstandings and/or judgement there.
1.2.2.2. Con: Not all towns and cities have a large enough population of non-binary people to create/maintain their own spaces. Suggesting that non-binary people can't use "women-only" spaces, and must use non-binary spaces means that many non-binary people will not have access to spaces.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Other spaces might exist, for example people can travel to cities at weekends or use online spaces.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Non-binary people have different lives and experiences with gender than women* do.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Considering non-binary folks could advance the creation of gender-neutral spaces which are beneficial to all genders, e.g. unisex toilets \(the need to 'go' is a universal human experience\).
1.2.3. Con: Since non-binary people specifically do not identify on either end of the gender spectrum, it is questionable why they should be included in a female-only space.
1.2.4. Con: Often these groups use [gendered language](https://femsplain.com/on-being-non-binary-in-female-spaces-12d5980e7f0c) and other forms of microaggressions that make non-binary people feel unwelcome.
1.2.4.1. Con: The use of gendered language is normal to people who are raised under binary gender. Its use is likely by habit, and not aimed to consciously exclude anyone.
1.2.4.2. Con: The term 'microaggression' is under scrutiny for being arbitrary and ambiguous. The 'aggression'-part implies conscious intent, which is often not the case \(confusingly\) with microaggressions. The term is not considered helpful to constructive discussion as it sets up an atmosphere of blame. See the heading 'What’s in a name redux' in this 2017 paper by Lilienfeld: [Microaggressions: Strong Claims, Inadequate Evidence](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691616659391). Lilienfeld considers this term beyond repair and recommends replacement.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: The assumption of conscious intent is often not verified. This allows this perception to start living it's own life. Note: Lack of trust plays, understandably, a big role here.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: Microaggressions are not just a "perception". They are very real, and born out of people having [unchecked biases](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-science-of-microaggressions-its-complicated/), which are often racial in nature. For example, telling a person of colour that they are "articulate" or "educated" feeds into the long standing, racist stereotype that people of colour are uneducated or must be inarticulate.
1.2.4.2.3. Pro: Although [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression) confirms the term 'microaggression', its validity is heavily disputed elsewhere. It is referred to as [desperately seeking discrimination](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/microaggression-desperately-seeking-discrimination1/16407#.W5K2pugza70), [nonsense](https://blackcommunitynews.com/fascism-and-the-micro-aggression-nonsense/), [Academic Fascism](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2015/08/walter-e-williams/academic-fascism/), [a cult](http://takimag.com/article/the_cult_of_microaggressions_steve_sailer/), [hypersensitive nitpicking](https://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/20/rosen-microaggression-is-hypersensitive-nitpicking/)
1.2.4.3. Pro: Even the name 'women-only' is an example of such gendered language.
1.2.5. Pro: These spaces exist for people who are faced with patriarchal oppression. A non-binary person also faces such [oppression](https://sisteroutrider.wordpress.com/2017/09/05/binary-or-spectrum-gender-is-a-hierarchy/).
1.2.5.1. Con: Women of Colour and white women both face patriarchal oppression. However their experiences of it are different so they should have separate spaces to discuss such issues. The same is true of non-binary people.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.3. Pro: Trans women and cis women have more commonalities than differences.
1.3.1. Pro: Both trans and cis women are required to perform [femininity](https://www.bustle.com/p/7-ways-women-are-expected-to-perform-femininity-on-a-daily-basis-29171), ie. society tells them what they should look and act like.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Trans women face an [impossible balance](https://www.allure.com/story/beauty-standards-transgender-women), between being accused of being a parody for trying too hard, and being told they aren't trying hard enough to be feminine.
1.3.2. Pro: Both trans and cis women are discriminated against by patriarchal society.
1.3.3. Pro: Both cis women and trans women experience [sexual harassment](https://hellogiggles.com/lifestyle/sexual-harassment-dont-forget-trans-women/).
1.3.4. Con: Most trans women will [never experience](http://thefederalist.com/2018/07/25/no-men-taking-transgender-hormones-dont-get-periods/) menstruation in the strictest sense of the word \(the flow of menstrual blood approximately two weeks after ovulation\).
1.3.4.1. Con: Trans women undergoing hormone replacement treatment experience cyclical period symptoms even if they do not technically menstruate.
1.3.4.2. Con: Postmenopausal women experience a decline in fertility and typically no longer experience [periods](http://www.healthtalk.org/peoples-experiences/later-life/menopause/loss-fertility). This does not mean that these women should not be able to access women only spaces. By the same token, trans women should also not be excluded from these spaces.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: Postmenopausal women have the experience of a lifetime of menstruation in a way that trans women have not. This comparison is therefore invalid.
1.3.4.3. Con: Many cis women [don't menstruate](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19993421/period-symptoms-but-no-period/) during their periods.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: Both physical issues like PCOS, excessive exercise, or nutritional imbalances and psychological issues like stress can [cause](https://www.bloodandmilk.com/why-do-i-have-period-symptoms-but-no-period/) a menstrual cycle without actual bleeding in cis women.
1.3.5. Con: Most trans women can't and won't ever be pregnant. Given that reproductive rights are often a core issue in women-only spaces, this difference between trans and cis women is significant.
1.3.5.1. Con: The struggle for reproductive rights and trans rights are united in their belief that all women should have autonomy over their own bodies. As a result, trans and cis women can easily find common cause if they inhabit the same spaces.
1.3.5.2. Con: Central to the struggle for reproductive rights is pursuit of affordable and effective healthcare for women. Both trans and cis women [benefit](https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/rj_and_transgender_fact_sheet.pdf) when improvements are made in this area. As a result, trans and cis women are united, not divided, by the reproductive rights movement.
1.3.5.3. Pro: Women only spaces that include trans women may find it more difficult to focus on reproductive rights if the trans women in those spaces have no incentive to fight for those rights.
1.3.5.3.1. Con: This prediction is not borne out in reality. Trans-inclusive women only spaces have [fought](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/27/glitter-reproductive-rights-rise-of-nail-bar-activism-female-only-spaces-domestic-violence) equally as hard for reproductive rights as trans-exclusive ones.
1.3.5.4. Con: New medical procedures are opening up the possibility for trans women to become pregnant. One expert claimed that trans women could get pregnant '[tomorrow](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/men-pregnant-womb-transplant-dr-richard-paulson-transgender-a8037201.html).'
1.3.5.5. Con: This distinction is not limited to trans women. Cis women may be unable to bear children, and there is a global divide between nations that allow abortion and to what degree. This does not invalidate other women's space in the conversation.
1.3.5.6. Con: The relevant characteristics in a women-only space are not biological, but social and cultural. It is irrelevant if they are biologically different if they share similar experiences, struggles and understandings of the world.
1.3.5.6.1. Con: There is no reason to think that they would have similar experiences, struggles and understandings of the world however. While both groups identify as women they would have had vastly different childhoods, issues and experiences.
1.3.5.7. Con: Reproductive rights also include the opportunity to pursue less common methods of family planning, including surrogates and adoption. Both trans and cis women have needs for these options.
1.3.6. Pro: Trans women are women. They are human beings whose gender is female.
1.3.6.1. Con: Radical feminists \("[TERFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_transgender_topics)"\) [support](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-25/germaine-greer-defends-views-on-transgender-issues/6883132) the opinion that post-operative transgender women are not women.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: Simply because one group believes something does not make it true. Some people believe climate change does not exist or hold racist viewpoints; simply because they hold these views does not make them true.
1.3.6.2. Con: There are many [aspects](https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2018/6/15/trans-women-and-cis-women-are-different-and-thats-ok) of “typical” cis womanhood that trans women will never experience including menstruation, abortions and birth control.
1.3.6.2.1. Con: Trans and cis women have very different experiences of womanhood but that doesn't make either experience any less valid.
1.3.6.2.1.1. Pro: No cis woman will [experience](https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2018/6/15/trans-women-and-cis-women-are-different-and-thats-ok) the need to fight to simply be seen as a woman. Nor fight to get hormones or worry about having doctors who understand a trans woman’s body.
1.3.6.2.2. Con: There are plenty of cis women who do not menstruate, become pregnant, have an abortion, or use birth control. This suggests that it is inaccurate to essentalise a woman's identity based on these arbitrary biological functions.
1.3.6.2.3. Pro: Trans women were not [socialised](https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2018/6/15/trans-women-and-cis-women-are-different-and-thats-ok) from birth as a female. From an early age they were not socialised to live up to society's beauty expectations, to take up little space and to accept being fantasised by men. Such aspects of being a woman and pressures during early socialisation will not have been experienced by trans women.
1.3.6.2.3.1. Con: Trans women suffer from the pressure to visually "pass" as women which is a direct result of patriarchal structures and what society expects women to look like. Conventional beauty standards can be a major cause for dysphoria in trans women. So trans women do know what it's like to suffer from the conventional ideal of femininity.
1.3.6.3. Pro: [Gender identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity) is the personal sense of one's own gender. So if somebody identifies as female, they are.
1.3.6.3.1. Pro: Denying trans women entry into 'women only' spaces furthers the inaccurate notion that biological sex determines an individual's gender.
1.3.6.3.2. Pro: There is more to being a woman than genitalia. If someone feels feminine and identifies with all the attributes of being a women then they shouldn't have to be trapped in a gender they have no connection to.
1.3.6.3.2.1. Con: Women does not mean “feminine person” or someone who likes things stereotypically associated with women. That would leave tons of actual women outside the definition of womanhood.
1.3.6.3.2.1.1. Pro: For example, many people identify as femme, independent of their gender identity.
1.3.6.3.3. Con: Just because someone identifies as female and considers themselves as female does not necessarily mean that others in complex society will also view them in the same way.
1.3.6.4. Con: The need for woman only spaces does not come from being a person who's gender is female. The main reason women need women only spaces is institutional misogyny.
1.3.6.4.1. Pro: Cis women and trans women while both suffering because of misogyny, experience it in different ways. This means that they have very different needs in relation to safe spaces.
1.3.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.6.1.
1.3.6.5. Con: Trans women pre-operation still have what constitutes as male genitalia, even if their personality and psychological makeup is feminine.
1.3.6.5.1. Pro: Some [argue](https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/sex-reassignment-doesnt-work-here-the-evidence) that trans people either become feminised men or masculinised women, impersonators of the sex with which they ‘identify.’
1.3.6.5.1.1. Pro: [3 to 18%](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jul/31/health.socialcare) of post-operative trans people have regretted going through gender reassignment surgery. Such a significant number indicates that sex change can leave people deeply conflicted about themselves, their sex and identity. This reinforces the notion that they do not fully realise or feel comfortable in their new identity as a woman.
1.3.6.5.1.2. Con: Trans women innately identify as being a woman [trapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminine_essence_concept_of_transsexuality) in a man's body. It would be an insult to label such individuals as "impersonators" since they are so strongly connected to their femininity and womanhood.
1.3.6.5.1.3. Con: Being transgender is often an extremely [complex](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/10/transgender-stories-people-think-we-wake-up-and-decide-to-be-trans) experience, which can lead to challenging and marginalised lives within mainstream society. To live through such an ordeal to simply "impersonate" and not fully embody being a woman would be futile.
1.3.6.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.6.
1.3.6.5.3. Con: What genitals a person has determines their [sex](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/232363.php), not their gender. A person can be a woman but have male genitals, in fact many trans people do not get [surgery](https://www.hrc.org/resources/transgender-faq#9).
1.3.6.5.4. Con: The relationship between a person’s gender and their body goes beyond reproductive functions.
1.3.6.5.4.1. Pro: [Research](https://www.genderspectrum.org/quick-links/understanding-gender/) increasingly points to the brain as a key role in how one experiences gender.
1.3.6.6. Con: The different words ‘trans women’ and ‘women’ indicate the distinct difference between the two groups. This prevents them from being defined equally.
1.3.6.6.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.3.1.
1.3.6.6.2. Con: Simply because different language is used does not mean that the two groups are not both groups of women. In the same way, black women and white women are different groups, with different life experiences but still are both groups of women.
1.3.6.6.2.1. Con: When skin colour or ‘black/white’ is used as a descriptive adjective for ‘woman’, it does not affect the constant implied meaning of ‘woman’. ‘Trans’, as an adjective, reduces the meaning of ‘woman’ from a constant state to an inconstant state, by indicating the person was initially not a ‘woman’.
1.3.6.6.2.1.1. Con: Trans women were always women- it is not the fault of trans individuals that they were assigned a different gender at birth.
1.3.6.7. Pro: Simply because some people may believe that someone does not 'pass' as a woman doesn't mean they are not a woman; gender cannot be assumed by someone's appearance.
1.3.6.7.1. Pro: We can usually only tell a baby's or child's gender by its clothes, rather than by appearance.
1.3.6.7.2. Pro: It is an outdated assumption to judge only by appearances, this includes gender identity. Such superficial judgements no longer are relevant in today's diverse and modern society where people can be completely different to what their appearance conveys.
1.3.6.7.2.1. Pro: It is possible for a cis woman to be [mistaken](https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/08/21/25364977/savage-love-letter-of-the-day-cis-woman-mistaken-for-trans) as a "non passing trans woman" or a man in drag.
1.3.6.7.3. Pro: Even if someone thinks they can “tell” if someone is trans or not, a trans person who doesn't “pass” as looking female is still entitled to be in a single-sex space.
1.3.7. Con: Given that neither trans nor cis women are homogenous groups, all women within both will have different experiences of their own gender identity. Whether someone feels that they have a lot or not a lot in common with a member of the other group is an individual matter.
1.3.8. Pro: Trans women will self select into the women only spaces where their experiences are most closely aligned to those of the cis women currently involved. As a result, the commonalities, rather than the differences, between the two groups will be most apparent in their interactions.
1.3.8.1. Pro: Trans women would have no incentive to access women only-spaces that are of little relevance to them, for instance a [lactation room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation_room).
1.3.8.1.1. Con: [New](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/14/transgender-woman-breastfeed-health) medical developments will likely enable trans women to breastfeed in the future.
1.3.9. Con: Trans women have experience of male privilege that cis women do not.
1.3.9.1. Con: Many trans women pre-transition do not experience male privilege because of prejudicial attitudes towards feminine attributes that they [possess](https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a34593/laverne-cox-writes-about-why-not-all-trans-women-experienced-male-privilege-pre-transition/).
1.3.9.2. Con: Even if trans women have experienced male privilege at some point in their lives, trans women [lose](https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/afternoons/audio/2018644143/a-transwoman-on-losing-male-privilege) that privilege after their transition. The immediate experience of trans women and cis women in these spaces is therefore more similar than different.
1.3.9.3. Pro: Even though a trans women may not longer benefit from male privilege after they transition, they can still benefit from the fact that they had that privilege in the past. For example, if they received a higher wage in the past and now have more savings.
1.3.9.3.1. Con: Trans women face an [even wider wage gap](https://www.macleans.ca/society/for-transgender-women-the-pay-equity-gap-is-even-wider/) than cis women, and may see their earnings drop by up to a third after transitioning.
1.3.9.4. Con: The experience of[male privilege](https://medium.com/the-establishment/what-trans-women-have-is-far-more-complicated-than-male-privilege-a39af51fde62) that trans women have pre-transition can be undermined by the fact that they experience oppression through not being able to identify with their true gender at that point in time.
1.4. Con: The life experiences of cisgender women and transgender women can be quite different so they should have different spaces.
1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.2.
1.4.2. Pro: Cisgender women experience lack of privilege from early on, especially if they are also part of a minority or other marginalized community.
1.4.3. Pro: It is unlikely that the voices of trans women will be given equal prominence within women only spaces. For this reason, it would be more effective for trans women to have their own spaces.
1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.3.
1.4.5. Pro: The intrinsic nature of these spaces is that they were never intended to be inclusive. People who feel they don't fit into existing exclusive spaces should work to create their own, rather than trying to demand acceptance into other groups exclusive spaces.
1.4.6. Con: To create additional spaces for transgender women continues to isolate them from society.
1.4.6.1. Con: Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminism is a problem for transgender women as it can often lead to discrimination against them. Given 'women-only' spaces are often run or attended by feminists, if some of those feminists are trans-exclusionary it can make the space unsafe.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: Women-only spaces should ban hostile anti-trans protesters from their membership. The existence of [hostile](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/anti-trans-protests-london-pride-transgender-transphobia-terf-lgbt-feminist-a8448521.html) anti trans protesters should not be used as an excuse to exclude trans women.
1.4.7. Con: Given there are less trans women than cis women, it may be harder to have a space just for trans women, when there are less of them who can be members. This can be due to, for example, a lack of funds or a lack of members to hold certain kinds of meetings.
1.4.7.1. Con: Because trans women are within the minority in society, it is likely groups specifically supporting trans women would attract a strong following. Due to the lack of such spaces, the few spaces available are likely to draw an influx of people seeking help and a chance to meet like minded individuals.
1.4.8. Con: It is important for trans and cis women to share experiences in order to learn about each other and create a more inclusive and cohesive community.
1.4.8.1. Pro: For example, many feminists are unaware of how their language can have an exclusionary effect on trans women. Phrases such as, "[pussy power](https://www.bustle.com/p/4-ways-women-only-spaces-can-be-anti-feminist-even-when-they-dont-mean-to-be-32798)" are problematic because they imply that in order to be an "authentic woman", it is a requirement to have a vagina. The presence of trans women in female spaces will help to prevent such language being used.
1.4.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.4.9. Con: The life experiences of any two people are likely to differ greatly for many reasons. Excluding a trans person for being trans denies their experience.
1.4.10. Pro: Transgender women face [oppression](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/truth-about-trans#trans-people-uk) that cisgender women never will and it can often come from cisgender women. They need their own space to escape from such oppression.
1.4.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.1.
1.5. Con: The owners of privately owned 'women only spaces' should be allowed to determine who counts as a ' women' and is thus allowed to enter their women only spaces.
1.5.1. Con: In instances where the private sector is de facto the only provider of women only spaces, it is necessary for the state to regulate them to ensure women have meaningful access to the facilitates they need.
1.5.1.1. Pro: During recessions, vital state funded services such as women's shelters are often subject to [cuts](https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/heather-mcrobie/austerity-and-domestic-violence-mapping-damage). In these circumstances, privately run charities are often de facto the only providers of these services.
1.5.2. Con: Some public spaces are segregated for cultural reasons, such as washrooms. A reasonable degree of restriction based on identity does not harm anyone.
1.5.3. Con: This opens the door to gender based discrimination.
1.5.3.1. Con: Gender based discrimination in private spaces is legal. For example, actual "[private clubs](https://www.aclupa.org/news/2009/08/21/when-is-a-private-club-not-a-private-club)" are allowed to choose their membership on certain criteria, including discriminating by gender.
1.5.3.2. Con: It is unlikely that policies which are applied in private groups and spaces will go on to affect national laws or wider social beliefs about gender.
1.5.4. Con: Some people might find it emotionally distressing to have their privacy intruded upon by a person they perceive to be of the other gender.
1.5.5. Con: Gender specific public space is often implemented to protect people. In [Rio de Janeiro](https://womenintheworld.com/2015/04/13/a-look-at-women-only-transportation-around-the-globe/) and many other cities female-only carriages in the metro have been introduced to protect women from harassment on public transport.
1.5.6. Con: Often these spaces are private groups e.g. gyms, discussion groups etc. They are entitled to set their own rules on membership.
1.6. Con: With regards to women-only spaces like clinics and shelters, trans women would receive more appropriate help from a dedicated LGBT/trans space. Unless workers at women's shelters are specially trained, they would be able to provide adequate support, neither medically nor psychologically.
1.6.1. Con: While more niche treatment and assistance or care may be better, many communities have no such resources. It is better for a trans woman to receive mediocre accommodations and assistance at a women's shelter than to be homeless.
1.7. Con: Allowing trans women into women-only spaces opens the door for men as well.
1.7.1. Con: The fact that some people men might abuse this space is not a reason to prevent trans people from accessing it. It is better to have policies to remove people trying to abuse the space, rather than remove access to the space for trans women, given the space can be beneficial to them.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Security staff can remove disruptive members from such spaces.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: When men enter the women only space they cannot be removed when trans women are legally allowed to be there. Even calling security won't help, because all that these men have to do in order to prevent being removed is to 'claim' that they identify as women.
1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Even other women could be removed if they are making the other people in the space feel uneasy due to their actions. This would not be a licence for bad behaviour.
1.7.1.1.1.2. Con: A man can already invade women's spaces if he wants to unless the space is heavily guarded by security. There would not be a need to craft a fake trans identity.
1.7.1.1.1.3. Con: There are significantly more trans women who would be hurt or put in danger by being excluded than there are men willing to pretend to be trans women in order to get into women's spaces, and as the purpose of women's spaces is to protect women it doesn't make sense to sacrifice trans women in order to protect cis women.
1.7.1.1.2. Con: Women-only spaces are often either publicly funded or voluntary spaces. As a result, they often lack the resources needed to introduce the level of policing that would be required to keep these spaces safe for the cis women who use them.
1.7.1.1.2.1. Pro: At best, women only spaces would have to divert resources from the facilities and services that they currently provide in order to afford additional policing. This would reduce the quality of service drastically for the cis women who currently use them. Crucially, spaces allocated only for men face no such costs.
1.7.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Gay clubs have been targets of harassment and violent attacks, and have needed to protect themselves and their patrons.
1.7.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: For example, the funeral service held for the victims of the Pulse shooting was [picketed](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/orlando-shooting-angels-block-westboro-baptist-church-protestors-from-victims-funerals-a7090041.html) by religious extremists. Volunteers stepped in and protected mourners.
1.7.1.1.2.2. Pro: At worst, women only spaces would be unable to provide the policing required to keep these spaces safe and usable for women. This is the worst of both worlds, as in this scenario neither cis nor trans woman are able to effectively access these important spaces.
1.7.1.1.2.3. Con: Every space, whether public or privately established, sets up its own rules and guidelines. If anyone breaks them, they can easily be asked to leave, without incurring further cost.
1.7.1.1.3. Pro: The police pursue men who try and enter these spaces to cause [harm](https://www.kansas.com/news/local/crime/article211926634.html).
1.7.1.2. Con: [Private](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/hotels/articles/the-irresistible-rise-of-women-only-hotels-and-resorts/) women only spaces will face increased costs if they must introduce new policing measures. These costs are likely to be passed on to the women who use these services. Given that the poorest [women](https://qz.com/1170426/the-poorest-americans-are-12-times-as-likely-to-be-sexually-assaulted/) are often those who need women only spaces the most, this will mean that those women may now be unable to access them due to increased cost.
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: Trans people \(including trans men\) make up around [0.39%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5227946/) of the population in the US. Similar proportions are likely in other western countries. The additional policing costs associated with allowing this tiny group to access women only spaces mean that it is likely that fewer women overall would be able to access women only spaces.
1.7.1.3. Pro: Religious places of worship are important but often face attacks, however the solution is to prevent attacks not remove access to the place of worship.
1.7.1.4. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.2.
1.7.1.5. Con: A few incidents of abuse \(in a certain location\) is all it takes to undermine the safety of that- and nearby women only spaces.
1.7.2. Con: It seems unlikely that men would want to use women-only spaces such as bathrooms and gyms given they have equivalent facilities available to them.
1.7.2.1. Con: The type of men that will prefer female space \(above equivalent male space\) will be the abusive type.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: There are security measures that can be implemented to ensure that abusive individuals do not enter women- only space, as opposed to excluding trans women, as the above source seems to suggest as a solution.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: For example, access to changing rooms could require a membership card to be swiped- this could limit access in order to prevent people with malicious intent entering easily.
1.7.2.1.2. Con: Even if someone pretended to be transgender and entered a changing room with the intent of exposing themselves or otherwise, they would be subject to the same [laws on sexual assault](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/what-if-a-pervert-pretend_b_12677938.html) as they otherwise would be.
1.7.2.1.3. Con: We have [no information](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/what-if-a-pervert-pretend_b_12677938.html) to inform us that predators dressing up as women to access women-only spaces is actually occurring, despite changing rooms and other women's space being open to trans women for years in many places. If this were to occur it would be major, national news given the debate that surrounds the topic.
1.7.2.1.4. Con: Given that there are few reports of men pretending to be women to access bathrooms etc., while trans individuals face huge discrimination, and [avoid bathrooms](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/transgender-issues/herman-jpmss-june-2013/) \(often resulting in UTIs\), it is probably more important on balance of harms that trans people be able to live their lives fully.
1.7.2.1.5. Pro: There are reports about abusive penetration \(video taping\) happening: [nbcwashington](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Man-Dressed-as-Woman-Arrested-for-Spying-Into-Mall-Bathroom-Stall-Police-Say-351232041.html), [avtimes](http://theavtimes.com/2013/05/14/palmdale-man-arrested-for-videotaping-in-womens-bathroom/)
1.7.2.1.6. Pro: The University of Toronto [closes Transgender Bathrooms](https://www.dailywire.com/news/330/university-toronto-dumps-transgender-bathrooms-pardes-seleh) after incidents
1.7.2.1.7. Pro: Statistical evidence of a rise in sexual abuse cases comes from a [study](http://womanmeanssomething.com/targetstudy/) by the activist group Woman Means Something.
1.7.2.2. Con: A man [sued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stopps_v_Just_Ladies_Fitness_\(Metrotown\)_Ltd) a women's gym for sex discrimination because he was not allowed in.
1.7.2.3. Con: [Men's rights](https://hellogiggles.com/news/why-its-not-sexist-to-ban-men-from-women-only-spaces/) groups have targeted women-only spaces in the past. If men are allowed to enter into those spaces if they merely self-identify as women, such groups may use the opportunity to undermine and possibly destroy these spaces for women.
1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.1.1.
1.7.4. Con: This is a critique of self-identification policies, not a critique of whether trans women belong. With a different set of criteria, e.g. medical gatekeeping instead of self identification, this concern would be completely negated.
1.7.4.1. Con: Installing medical gate keeping at every women's dressing room sounds highly unrealistic.
1.7.5. Pro: Statistical evidence shows that [Sexual incidents increased](http://womanmeanssomething.com/targetstudy/) since publication of Target’s gender-inclusion policy in April, 2016
1.7.5.1. Con: The methodology is flawed, relying on media reports instead of incident reports during a time when the media was focused on the issue \(and largely biased towards casting the bathroom policy in an unfavorable light\). Crime waves are public events visible through and, more significantly, [produced](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=0qN0BQAAQBAJ&pg=PT14&lpg=PT14&dq=scientific+method+relying+on+media+coverage+to+gather+statistics&source=bl&ots=xBOzrYMVrj&sig=BlOyJqyqCrYs2H2l7wC0XELBre0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwig2IDr7OjdAhUaZt4KHZYNCP8Q6AEwDnoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=scientific%20method%20relying%20on%20media%20coverage%20to%20gather%20statistics&f=false) by news reports. A [study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/522733?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) shows that newspaper data are a result of combining news value, the journalistic profession, and a cultural reproduction process.
1.7.5.2. Con: The linked study uses media reported instances of sexual incidents. In a climate where [transphobia](https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2017/01/17/transphobic-slurs-and-death-wishes-how-right-wing-media-responded-commutation-chelsea-manning-s/215039) is rampant in conservative media, it is to be expected that there would be out sized airtime given to sexual incidents associated with gender inclusive policies.
1.7.5.2.1. Con: We can also apply the parent reasoning to liberal media: In a climate where gender-inclusive policies are celebrated in liberal media, it is to be expected that under sized airtime will be given to sexual incidents associated with these same gender-inclusive policies.
1.7.5.3. Con: The study cited is associated with the "WOMAN Means Something" campaign, which has a clear anti-trans [agenda](http://womanmeanssomething.com/about/). As a result, this study is not a neutral or trustworthy source.
1.7.5.3.1. Con: This site is not anti-trans-rights, [it is pro sex-rights](http://womanmeanssomething.com/where-we-agree-and-disagree-with-c-16/), which is a different thing. Labeling every critical note as anti-trans is such a discussion killer.
1.7.5.3.1.1. Con: The language on this site used is 'Most women I know would not feel comfortable in a shower naked with a strange male \(even if they identified as a woman\).' This both refers to trans women as strange and denies their gender identity by referring to them as a 'male'. It is therefore transphobic.
1.7.5.3.1.1.1. Con: As I read it, the words 'strange male' refer to 'a male she does not know', not to 'a male being strange'.
1.7.5.3.1.1.2. Con: This text takes the perspective of a women encountering a male looking body belonging to a person she does not know. Of course her first response will be: Help, a male!! This is not denial perse, this is written from a perspective of a woman not being familiar with body-gender contradictions. Therefore dismissing these words as trans-phobic seems premature.
1.7.5.4. Con: The period the study examines is the same period in which awareness of sexual crimes has increased [exponentially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Too_movement). In light of this, the study's claim that "No other theory seems to account for the significant and precisely-timed increase seen in the Target reports" is blatantly false.
1.7.5.4.1. Con: This claim is incorrect. The study analyzes 220 media-reported sexual offenses in Target stores [from 2003 to August of 2017](http://womanmeanssomething.com/targetstudy/), while the metoo movement [started to get viral in October 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Too_movement).
1.7.5.4.1.1. Con: The #MeToo movement is not the be all and end all of awareness of sexual crimes. Increasing awareness of [sexual crimes](http://thedmonline.com/sexual-assault-rise-in-awareness-increases-number-of-reports/) is a developments that has occurred since 2003.
1.7.6. Con: It is disingenuous to suggest that allowing trans women to enter women only spaces, will also result in men being permitted entry, since men, unlike trans women, do not self identify as women.
1.7.6.1. Con: It is easy to lie about self-identifying as a trans woman, as there is no effective way to verify the internal thoughts of a person.
1.7.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.1.1.
1.7.6.1.2. Con: It is also very easy to lie about something else in order to gain access to a space, e.g. a man lying about his wife / daughter being in the bathroom and needing his assistance. Distrusting people by default is not a good strategy and feeds paranoia.
1.7.6.1.3. Con: Very few people will lie about their gender identity to gain access to 'women only spaces'. A small handful of problematic individuals should not be allowed to undermine sincere efforts to make 'women only' spaces more inclusive.
1.7.6.1.3.1. Con: The damage done by a small number of men in women only spaces is potentially massive - including risks of sexual assault, harassment and stalking. Even if such events are rare, their impact on women's lives is very large.
1.7.6.1.3.2. Con: Even if the number of men who seek to abuse this space is small, the fear of abuse of these spaces may undermine the feeling of safety and protection that these spaces provide to women. In many cases, that feeling of safety is the reason that women seek out these spaces in the first place.
1.7.6.1.3.3. Pro: People who enter with problematic intent, are likely to engage in equally problematic conduct. It will be easy to remove those people once they exhibit such behaviour.
1.7.6.2. Con: Emerging concepts of [gender fluidity](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/beyond-the-binary-what-does-it-mean-to-be-genderfluid-1.2418434) present an additional challenge to women only spaces, as someone who sometimes presents as a man may also present as a woman at a different time. In light of this, verifying that a person is identifying as a woman in good faith is additionally difficult.
1.7.7. Con: The phrase "opening the door for" is a slippery slope fallacy. There is no reason that allowing Trans women into spaces would lead to allowing men, as trans women are a separate category of people and not in any way male. Allowing them in is no more likely to lead to allowing men in than it is to allowing all people dressed as dinosaurs in.
1.7.7.1. Con: Facilitating entry to trans women by removing legal verification that the claimant is living as trans \(as the [UK](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/721725/GRA-Consultation-document.pdf) and [Scottish](https://beta.gov.scot/publications/review-gender-recognition-act-2004/pages/1/) government are suggesting\) would allow cis men to take advantage of anti-discrimination legislation
1.7.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.1.3.
1.7.7.1.2. Con: Men who are likely to take advantage of these laws are likely doing so to protest against trans rights. They will not be deferred in their actions due to laws; whether a law in place is or not will not change their actions.
1.7.8. Con: -> See 1.3.6.
1.7.9. Pro: Perpetuating the idea that women need to be protected from men at all costs can feed into toxic masculinity because it implies that all men are by default dangerous.
1.7.9.1. Pro: Men can be victims of violence, too, so the goal shouldn't be to be "safe from all men" but "safe from perpetrators". Denying people access to spaces based on gender is not useful in that regard.
1.7.9.2. Pro: Shielding women from men affirms the notion that women are inferior.
1.7.9.3. Con: Men do have greater upper body strength then women and have the physical ability to force women. Therefore it makes sense to take this difference in strength into account, both for women and for society.
1.7.9.4. Con: It makes little sense to abstain from warning people, because of fears that issuing such a warning might stimulate unwanted behavior in others.
1.7.10. Pro: [Protesters](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/09/debate-over-inclusion-of-trans-women-in-women-only-spaces-intensifies) against the inclusion of trans women in Hampstead Heath Pond have argued that allowing anyone who says that they are a woman into their facilities would allow men with malicious intentions to access their space.
1.7.10.1. Pro: The inclusion of trans women in Hampstead Heath Pond, made some women who had been using the pond for years feel that they they were [no longer welcome](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/transgender-women-hampstead-heath-ladies-pond-kenwood-kate-moss-a8136581.html) at the pond.
1.7.10.1.1. Pro: The BBC [interviewed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-london-44902047/hampstead-heath-women-only-pond-in-trans-women-debate) users of the swimming facility, some of whom stated that they would no longer use Hamsptead Heath Pond because they felt that the presence of trans women made them feel uncomfortable.
1.7.10.1.1.1. Con: Trans women should not be penalised because of these people. These people who feel uncomfortable, instead should be making an effort to [challenge](http://www.transadvocate.com/ask-matt-why-do-trans-people-make-me-uncomfortable_n_8773.htm) why trans individuals make them uncomfortable.
1.7.10.1.1.2. Con: Anecdotes like this, devoid of knowing the motivations and true feelings of those questioned, are of little value in determining the principal.
1.7.10.2. Con: Women with malicious intent can already access those spaces. Clearly the solution is dealing with malicious intent, not trying to pre-determine if someone has it from their biology.
1.7.10.3. Con: The protesters included people often accused of [transphobia](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/01/julie-bindel-transphobia). As a result, their opinions should not be taken into account.
1.7.10.3.1. Con: Just because certain people within a protest have held views which are objectionable does not mean that the arguments that protesters are putting forward are totally illegitimate. By the same token, it would be intellectually dishonest to dismiss the entirety of a political party's platform just because certain members of that party have expressed "offensive views".
1.7.10.3.2. Con: Phrases such as "oppressive towards others" and "transphobic" are deliberately used by trans rights activists to silence and intimidate those who have legitimate concerns.
1.7.10.3.2.1. Con: Rather than just being a tactic, these protesters are genuinely frequently transphobic, in their conduct and discussion, in particular when they refuse to acknowledge trans women as women, and want to deny them access to [bathrooms](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/5/11592908/transgender-bathroom-laws-rights).
1.7.10.3.2.2. Pro: This is indeed strongly framed language. The strong focus on oppression stems from Cultural Marxism, which divides the world in [those that are oppressing, and those that are oppressed](https://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/what-cultural-marxism).
1.7.10.3.2.2.1. Con: "[Cultural Marxism](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/19/cultural-marxism-a-uniting-theory-for-rightwingers-who-love-to-play-the-victim)" is an idea created by right-wing thinkers who state that the humanities "brainwash" students into accepting "far-left ideology".
1.7.10.3.2.2.2. Con: "Cultural Marxism" is used by the so-called "alt right" as an [umbrella](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/78mnny/unwrapping-the-conspiracy-theory-that-drives-the-alt-right) term for many ideas they oppose, like multiculturalism, liberalism, feminism, among others.
1.7.10.3.2.3. Pro: Dedicated blogs about silencing and intimidation by trans activists can be found online, for example [banned by trans](https://bannedbytrans.wordpress.com/masterpost/)
1.7.10.3.2.4. Pro: Everyone is a risk of being called out as trans-phobic. Veteran gay rights activist Peter Tatchell got in 2016 caught up in a row over ‘no-platforming’. [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/13/peter-tatchell-snubbed-students-free-speech-veteran-gay-rights-activist)
1.7.10.3.2.5. Pro: In 2015, this [open letter in the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2015/feb/14/letters-censorship?CMP=twt_gu) describes a worrying pattern of intimidation and silencing of "individuals whose views are deemed transphobic / whorephobic".
1.7.10.3.2.5.1. Con: Purely anecdotal evidence is of little use in creating general principals.
1.7.10.3.2.5.2. Con: The issue here is harassment and bad behaviour, not that the alleged perpetrator is trans or supports trans rights.
1.7.10.3.3. Pro: Protesters have referred to trans women as ["cross dressers"](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/transgender-women-hampstead-heath-ladies-pond-kenwood-kate-moss-a8136581.html). This misgendering is undeniably transphobic.
1.7.11. Pro: Women only spaces have typically allowed trans women who appear to be cis into their spaces for [decades](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/transgender-women-hampstead-heath-ladies-pond-kenwood-kate-moss-a8136581.html). Self-identification is a much lower bar for allowing women into these spaces. Since anyone can self-identify as a woman at any point, it is easy for this circumstance to be abused.
1.7.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.3.
1.7.11.2. Con: No one is seriously suggesting that just saying "I'm a woman now" is enough to self identify. For such a statement to be accepted it would have to be accompanied by an attempt to live as a woman on a permanent basis. Like any statement its honesty would be judged.
1.7.11.2.1. Con: Then this judgement will have to be done by a judge, otherwise it's deemed to be viewed arbitrary. Making a pass through court in order to use a female dressing room seems unrealistic.
1.7.11.2.1.1. Con: This is not necessarily true, one could simply be required to show a document that proves they have been living as a woman for a substantial amount of time. This could be issued by their doctor who assists their medical transition or it could be their ID if they had their "legal" gender officially changed. Much like a certificate of disability, there could be a certificate of gender transition.
1.7.11.2.2. Con: Emerging concepts of gender [fluidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer) have challenged the notion that a person must live as a woman to identify as one. Applying an arbitrary test of "truthfuless" to the identity of individuals who want access these spaces will likely exclude the most vulnerable members of the trans community.
1.7.11.3. Con: "Passing" as a gatekeeping mechanism is extremely hurtful to trans people and even cis women who are not traditionally feminine. It perpetuates outdated, superficial and rigid definitions of gender.
1.7.11.4. Con: To simply self-identify as a woman in some cases is not enough, especially if such a space is dealing with vulnerable or at risk people. An official document providing evidence of a medical transition or ID showing their legal gender could be necessary in such circumstances.
1.7.11.5. Pro: Trans women who have medical evidence that their biological sex does not correspond to their gender, should be permitted access to women only spaces. This ensures that individuals who genuinely need women only spaces can access them, and, it prevents individuals who have sinister motives for accessing women only spaces.
1.7.11.5.1. Con: To enforce this it would require cis women to also have medical evidence of their birth sex.
1.7.11.5.2. Con: It is exclusionary to require trans individuals to have medical certification before being permitted entry to women only spaces. The [cost, and time](https://news.sky.com/story/line-18-gender-debate-sparks-bitter-divide-among-trans-and-feminist-groups-11439676) required to obtain medical evidence is prohibitive for many individuals.
1.7.11.5.2.1. Pro: In the [UK](https://news.sky.com/story/line-18-gender-debate-sparks-bitter-divide-among-trans-and-feminist-groups-11439676), an individual who wants to be medically certified as trans, is required to have lived with their preferred gender for 2 years, undergo assessment by medical experts, and pay £140.
1.8. Pro: If trans women are not welcome in women only spaces, it is likely that trans men would not be welcome in men only spaces either. Trans men would be required to use women only spaces, including bathrooms/showers and support groups.
1.8.1. Con: Given women's only and men's only spaces are separate ones, it is unlikely that the rules of one will determine the rules of another.
1.8.1.1. Pro: It is the perceived danger of sexual assault that prevents cis women from accepting trans women into women's spaces because most sexual predators are men. This wouldn't apply to men's spaces, because they would not feel threatened by a woman impersonating a man.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: It is irrational to assume only men in women's spaces are a possible danger, since men suffer from sexual assault \(by men and women\) too.
1.8.1.1.2. Con: It is more likely for a [trans woman to be sexually assaulted](http://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-assault-and-the-lgbt-community) than for a trans woman to commit sexual assault.
1.8.2. Pro: This would be incredibly harmful for trans men as it would reinforce a harmful idea that they are not real men.
1.8.3. Pro: Having trans men in a women's only space would impact on other women using that space as men would now be present.
1.9. Con: Allowing anyone who identifies as female into women-only spaces makes those spaces worse for cis women.
1.9.1. Con: Trans women are in real need of safe spaces. Trans women and girls face the same risk of violence from predatory men. In fact most [evidence](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/26/trans-women-single-sex-spaces-cruel-impossible) suggests they face a much higher risk.
1.9.1.1. Pro: [41 percent](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/truth-about-trans#trans-women-refuges) of trans people have experienced a hate crime in the past year and more than a quarter of trans people in relationships have faced domestic abuse from a partner.
1.9.1.2. Con: It is understood that trans women need safe spaces, but this by itself does not imply they should get access to women only spaces.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.7.
1.9.1.3. Con: It is unlikely that women-only spaces that are obligated to include trans women will be effective as safe spaces for trans women due to resentment.
1.9.1.3.1. Pro: If trans women were allowed into [Hampstead Heath](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/transgender-women-hampstead-heath-ladies-pond-kenwood-kate-moss-a8136581.html) pond despite the protests of existing members, they would likely face hostility and animosity from those members. This would not be an effective safe space for those trans women as a result.
1.9.2. Pro: Trans woman have not grown up from birth with the female [experience](https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a34593/laverne-cox-writes-about-why-not-all-trans-women-experienced-male-privilege-pre-transition/) and therefore it is difficult to share some of the difficulties, especially if some of these experiences are the root causes of what is being discussed in the women only spaces.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Trans women formerly would have been exposed to [male privilege](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/05/jenni-murray-transgender-not-real-women-sunday-times-magazine) and therefore some of the cis women in women only spaces may find it challenging to relate to trans women.
1.9.2.2. Con: Spaces that are positively only relevant to women who have been socialized as women can stay "women only". This is not true for all spaces though as not all of them relate to the experience of being raised as a woman.
1.9.2.3. Con: Not every female experience is equivalent, and we can't simply assume that every cis woman has had the same experience growing up. There are vast differences between individual women.
1.9.3. Pro: Some women have expressed concern that trans women seek to regulate the language used by cis women when speaking about gender issues. Though the intention is to make discussion of such issues more inclusive, many worry that this has the effect of silencing women who may fail to abide by shifting standards to acceptably inclusive language.
1.9.3.1. Pro: It is important that cis women can still talk about issues only cis women face.
1.9.3.2. Con: As trans women are in the minority, it is unlikely to assume that inclusive language and behaviour in certain spaces would reduce a cis woman's ability to talk about her specific issues. In many cases she will still be around other cis women.
1.9.4. Pro: Allowing in people with male genitalia might be traumatizing to cis women who are survivors of male violence.
1.9.4.1. Con: People would not be aware what genitalia a person has in these spaces as it is unlikely they would see someone else undressed.
1.9.4.1.1. Con: Any swimming club, sports club, even dance groups have common changing areas.
1.9.4.2. Con: Triggering can often come about through multiple factors e.g. [scents](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/trigger) associated with violence. Given that every incidence of violence is different it is impossible to cater for everyone's trigger. What is better is to provide people with support so that they can [overcome](https://www.recoveryranch.com/articles/battling-ptsd-triggers-effects-sexual-assault/) their triggers.
1.9.4.3. Con: It is wrong to imply that trans women are in any way responsible for acts of violence committed by men. Women who feel this way should be educated to be less prejudiced.
1.9.4.3.1. Pro: To combat prejudice, feminists should ensure more people are aware that trans women face a [similar](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/21/trans-women-rape-domestic-violence-dangers) risk of gendered violence as any one else that falls within the category of 'woman'. This is because, when an individual identifies as a women, they are treated as one by patriarchal society.
1.9.4.3.1.1. Pro: Thus, to deny trans women entry to women's only spaces, such as rape centers, or domestic violence shelters, is particularity problematic.
1.9.4.3.2. Con: According to the reasoning of this claim, women only spaces should also allow men to enter because no individual man should be held responsible to the crimes of other men.
1.9.4.3.2.1. Con: This would only be true if these spaces were public ones open to all. However, given they are women-only spaces, men should not be allowed to enter.
1.9.4.3.3. Pro: People's consideration of a security risk is often not accurate.
1.9.4.3.3.1. Pro: People are notoriously bad at assessing risks and dangers accurately, severely overestimating the probability of tragic events like terrorist attacks and severly underestimating the probability of much more common dangers \(like car accidents\).
1.9.4.3.3.2. Pro: People tend to forget that most of sexual assualts are carried out by people who were fairly close to the victim, not by complete strangers.
1.9.4.3.3.2.1. Con: This claim fails to take other forms of harassment into account: verbal, staring, groping, peep videos/photos
1.9.4.3.3.3. Pro: Many people hold [stereotypes](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1043986207306870) of African Americans believing them to be criminals but these are not valid views.
1.9.4.3.4. Con: Cis women who oppose trans women entering women only spaces are often [subjected to threats of violence](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/07/13/trans-rights-will-be-durable-only-if-campaigners-respect-womens-concerns) from militant trans activists. Thus, it is understandable, that some cis women are concerned about the risks they may face if anyone who self identifies as a woman is permitted entry into women-only spaces.
1.9.4.3.4.1. Con: If trans women were allowed in women's spaces, trans activists would have reached their goal and therefore no reason to attack women in those spaces.
1.9.4.3.5. Pro: In many nations, progressive legislation has allowed individuals who identify as trans women to access women only spaces. There is [no evidence](https://news.sky.com/story/line-18-gender-debate-sparks-bitter-divide-among-trans-and-feminist-groups-11439676) that this has resulted in an increase in violence against cis women.
1.9.4.4. Con: Needing a space where you are "safe from penises" is nonsensical and much like saying you need a space free from people with hands because you have been hit with a hand before. You cannot prohibit people from using a space based on body parts because almost all body parts could be used for violent acts.
1.9.4.5. Con: Excluding all people with penises because of some predatory men is sexist towards men.
1.9.4.6. Con: Transgender women can also be victims of people with penises and could be triggered in much the same way.
1.9.4.7. Pro: Many female rape survivors find women-only spaces where they are with cis women, who fully understand and share their particular experience of womanhood, to be incredibly important for their recovery.
1.9.4.7.1. Pro: The [2010 Equality Act](http://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance) protects transgender people from discrimination or exclusion from single-sex facilities, but contains one exception: in a group counselling session provided for female victims of sexual assault, exclusion of a “male-to-female trans person” is lawful if that person’s presence would make it unlikely for other clients to continue attending the session.
1.9.4.7.1.1. Pro: The fact that this exception was created demonstrates that female rape victims have more specific needs in their women only groups.
1.9.4.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.9.
1.9.4.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.2.3.
1.9.4.8. Pro: Women's spaces have traditionally been sanctuaries from male-dominated society.
1.9.4.8.1. Con: The problems of a male dominated society come from a culture of masculinity and not from what genitals a person has. These spaces can remain refuges from masculinity as they will be open to women* who would not exhibit the characteristics of toxic masculinity.
1.9.4.8.2. Con: If one wanted to truly free themselves from the patriarchy and therefore rigid gender roles, one would not equate trans women with men by utilizing internalized misogyny \(i.e. "women have to look a certain way to be considered real women"\) to deny trans women access to women's spaces.
1.9.4.9. Pro: Many people would consider this a security risk.
1.9.4.9.1. Con: -> See 1.9.4.3.3.
1.9.5. Con: It would not matter if including trans women were to make women only spaces worse for cis women. Both groups have an equal claim to their gender and therefore have an equal right to access women only spaces.
1.9.5.1. Pro: Within women, there are many different groups and identities whose access to spaces might undermine the quality of access for others. For instance, religious and homosexual women may find their preferences clashing. This is not a justification for arbitrarily excluding one in favour of another, as there is no fair way to adjudicate which group's preferences are more legitimate. Trans and cis women are no different.
1.9.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.
1.10. Pro: Most people who identify as women [appear](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/26/trans-women-single-sex-spaces-cruel-impossible) female. Attempts to exclude trans women from women-only spaces will require that a person's sex is verified. Such checks are likely to be invasive and intimidating for all women.
1.10.1. Con: Cis women who have a strong stance against including trans women will accept these tests, even if they are invasive, because they want to ensure that women only spaces, only include cis women.
1.10.1.1. Con: That some cis women might be transphobic does not lend validity to transphobia.
1.10.1.2. Con: Even in such a case, there is no physical evidence separating the genitalia of a trans woman from a cis woman. Thus, [blood tests](https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-how-is-a-karyotype-test-done-1120402) to establish a person's sex would be needed, slowing the process of membership.
1.10.1.3. Con: Not every woman trying to enter these "women-only spaces" may have a strong stance against including trans women. Those who do not may be displeased and/or angry about invasive or lengthly tests.
1.10.2. Pro: Checking patron's genitals violates a person's right to privacy.
1.10.2.1. Pro: Only police have the right to [strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_search) or frisk search a person when they suspect danger or illegal contraband on that person.
1.10.2.2. Con: DNA tests could be required and will in the future be very quick and cheap to do.
1.10.2.2.1. Con: This would require establishments to hire dedicated staff to test people entering these "women-only" spaces. The cost of this is unlikely to be cheap.
1.10.2.2.2. Con: DNA testing could cause undue stress for [intersex](http://www.isna.org/faq/what_is_intersex) people, some of which have differing DNA to their outward appearance.
1.10.3. Pro: It is intuitive that having "sex verification checks", which may require assessment of one's anatomy would increase the risk for abuse- there are numerous reports of [airport security checks](https://www.ranker.com/list/top-12-most-invasive-tsa-sexual-harassment-cases-_so-far_/ariel-kana) straying into the territory of assault.
1.10.4. Con: A simple pledge / oath "I was born with a female body" would probably be sufficient in most cases.
1.10.4.1. Con: This would be utterly ineffective.
1.10.5. Pro: Imposing checks may force trans women requesting help to come out when they are not ready.
1.10.6. Con: -> See 1.10.2.2.
1.11. Pro: Women-only spaces should strive to include all women.
1.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.
1.11.2. Pro: The purpose of women's only spaces is to provide safety for all women.
1.11.3. Pro: Not including transgender women sends a message that these women are not real women.
1.11.3.1. Pro: Excluding trans women would force them to use male spaces, such as bathrooms and showing facilities. As well as being dangerous for them, it may alarm male users just as much to see a woman enter that space.
1.11.3.2. Pro: This form of gatekeeping has been used in the past to exclude women of colour, and queer and lesbian women from women's spaces.
1.11.4. Pro: People identifying as female being forced to use men's spaces because of their physical appearance can harm their mental as well as their physical health, like [adverse effects from trying to avoid going to the bathroom](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1605912) or being [verbally or physically assaulted by people for trying to use the "wrong" bathroom](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf).
1.11.4.1. Pro: Especially in adolescents, being allowed to socially transition \(as well as medically\) greatly [reduces symptoms of dysphoria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4522917/).
1.11.5. Pro: Every woman has a unique experience. Welcoming all women is beneficial and can teach others about the different obstacles that women encounter.
1.11.6. Con: Many women-only spaces are focused on a particular issue that is specifically intended for a niche female audience.
1.11.6.1. Con: There are simple linguistic measures that can be taken to ensure that it is completely clear that a certain space only caters to people experiencing a particular issue. For example choosing the words "people who gave birth" instead of "mothers".
1.11.6.2. Con: If a space isn't useful for women not experiencing a certain kind of experience/problem, it's unlikely that they will join it.
1.11.6.3. Pro: Specific women* groups that are dedicated to certain issues are not useful for all women*, for example domestic violence or young mothers groups.
1.11.6.3.1. Con: It may be easier to place different restrictions on these groups. Rather than only allowing genetically female members in the young mother's club, only allow young mothers.
1.11.7. Con: If trans women are granted access to women only spaces, many [religious women](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/03/transgender-activists-and-the-real-war-on-women/) will de facto be excluded from accessing services in women only spaces.
1.11.7.1. Con: Religious views are a personal matter and should not be forced on others.
1.11.7.1.1. Con: For many, their religious identity is as important to them as their gender identity. Creating spaces which include religious women is therefore not a matter of forcing views on people, but of inclusion.
1.11.7.2. Con: Religious women are no less welcome in trans inclusive spaces than non-religious women.
1.11.7.2.1. Con: This claim completely negates the perspective of the religious women themselves. For some people, it could be offensive.
1.11.7.2.1.1. Pro: Multiple religions, as a core tenet of their religious practice, segregate males and females in religious events, and preclude casual contact with members of the opposite sex. Many strictly observant cis women would therefore not share a space by entering spaces with trans women, because they were biologically born as male.
1.11.7.2.1.1.1. Con: Many religions which traditionally separate male and female are working towards being inclusive of trans people, for example [Jewish](http://www.transtorah.org/PDFs/Trans_Friendly_Community.pdf) temples, or [mosques](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40802538).
1.11.7.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.6.
1.11.7.2.1.1.3. Pro: In [Orthodox Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_separation_in_Judaism#Synagogues), there are separate sections in a Synagogue for men and women during prayer services.
1.11.7.2.1.1.4. Pro: There is ongoing [debate](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124623737&t=1538338218952) within Islam about gender segregation in Mosques.
