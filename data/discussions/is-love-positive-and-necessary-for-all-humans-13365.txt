Discussion Title: Is Love Positive and Necessary for All Humans?

1. Love is Positive and Necessary For Humans.
1.1. Pro: Love is ultimate truth.
1.1.1. Pro: Those who experience true love know that it is a reality.
1.1.1.1. Con: This assumes that love is a singular experience that will recognise; the truth is that love, like grief, manifests in a variety of ways, not always easily recognisable and certainly not always real.
1.1.2. Con: Love is a subjective state that some biological organisations enter in order to facilitate the creation and subsequent rearing of offspring. The only truth is that these organisms experience love. Love itself is not 'ultimate truth'.
1.1.3. Con: There is no 'ultimate truth', it is a nonsensical phrase.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Agreed. It's a rorschach of meaning.
1.1.4. Pro: Truth is good and positively enforcing and if love abides in truth, then it is also good.
1.2. Pro: According to evolution, it's possible that love exists to keep alive the connection between two beings to raise and keep their child safe.
1.3. Con: Love is the cause of all miseries.
1.3.1. Pro: Nowadays love doesn't last forever, and often ends up with an heartbreaking rupture.
1.3.2. Pro: When sharing your life with someone, you have to make compromises on your personal projects. You can't easily move away to get a job somewhere else for instance.
1.3.2.1. Con: And yet this is teaches us compromises and to consider others, to not act with only self interest and allows humanity to be codependent which can see otherwise insurmountable goals accomplished.
1.3.3. Con: Love is also the cause of many real pleasures that you couldn't get alone.
1.3.4. Con: This is simply not the case. Misery can be derived from the loss of a limb, for example.
1.3.5. Pro: People [take advantage](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-personal-renaissance/201503/9-ways-some-people-will-take-advantage-you) of a good experience and turn love into misery.
1.3.6. Con: It is precisely a lack of love that is the cause of miseries associated with love.
1.4. Con: No, some humans are not loved.
1.4.1. Con: This doesn't mean it is any less positive and/or necessary.
1.4.2. Pro: People who are traumatized do not benefit from love. Without knowing the benefits, the do not want to take the risk with love.
1.4.3. Con: Humans who remain unloved are not as well-meaning.
1.4.4. Con: Whether they are loved or not does not mean it is not necessary. People starve without food as it is necessary to survival and growth.
1.5. Con: Love has a price and opportunity cost, which someone has to pay.
1.6. Pro: Love is the reason human beings are are different from other animals.
1.6.1. Con: Animals are understood to be [entirely capable of love](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-mysteries-love/201402/can-animals-love).
1.7. Pro: Most people need to feel love or needed. Without the *proper* love from a mother and father as a child is growing up can damage the child psychologically and make them scared to love or accept love in the future.
1.8. Con: People idealized the idea of love and that's why many see it as our main need. Everyone is different and define love differently to different things and/or are even happier in other ways other than love.
1.9. Pro: Love is the reason we live our lives happily.
1.9.1. Con: Happiness can exist without love.
1.10. Con: People don't need love; they need just sex, food and money.
1.10.1. Con: Some people definitely need love in their lives for emotional stability. This is evidenced by the fact people can feel lonely even when they have platonic friends.
1.10.2. Pro: Many people can survive perfectly happily without love: those with a [lesser degree of empathy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178110005901), [aromantics](http://wiki.asexuality.org/Aromantic_FAQ), et cetera.
1.10.2.1. Con: While true, these are exceptions; the vast majority of individuals do need love in some form. Contrary to the grandparent parent claim.
1.10.3. Pro: Material needs are a huge part of life, and as such, could well allow people to live perfectly happily without any need for love.
1.10.3.1. Con: Love, as an extension of [biochemistry](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/science-jan-june09-love_02-13), is arguably a material need.
1.10.4. Con: "Necessary" doesn't mean avoiding wars but rather the well being of an individual. Sex, food and money provides the physical sustainability. But we're not made up of a mere body. The psychological health is what makes us feel alive even in times of war/misery. Denying the role of emotions, is nothing but belittling the human nature itself.
1.10.5. Con: People are more complicated than that. An example of that is[hierarchy of needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) proposed by Maslow.
1.11. Pro: Love is the only way to keep this world at peace.
1.11.1. Con: The world is not at peace; war and conflict are rife, and always will be.
1.11.2. Con: To keep the world at peace people need respect for others \(either driven by morality or by fear of consequences\). Such extremely positive emotions like love are not necessary to secure peaceful coexistence.
1.11.3. Con: There are certainly more than one factor that allow to keep the world at peace.
1.12. Con: Love of one's own religion, nationality, identity can make people fight with each other.
1.12.1. Pro: [Religious wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_war) are not the primary cause of world conflict \(despite [common belief otherwise](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-alan-lurie/is-religion-the-cause-of-_b_1400766.html)\) but certainly have caused a large fraction.
1.12.2. Pro: Territorial disputes are similarly [very common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_territorial_disputes).
