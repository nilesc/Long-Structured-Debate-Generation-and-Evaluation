Discussion Title: Should the UK Remain in the EU if the only Alternative is a Hard Brexit?

1. The UK should remain in the EU if a hard Brexit is the only alternative option.
1.1. Pro: A hard Brexit will remove our current right to freedom of movement in Europe, restricting options for work, travel, and education.
1.1.1. Pro: It would remove the benefits of EU citizenship as a whole, which include free movement, but also diplomatic protection and voting rights. It also includes the right to be involved in decision-making at the European level through petitions. \(see TFEU part two, in particular article 20\) [eur-lex.europa.eu](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:12012E/TXT)
1.1.1.1. Con: Diplomatic protection offered through EU citizenship is immeasurably weaker than that offered through UK citizenship.
1.1.1.2. Con: The EU parliament is largely symbolic and so are voting rights in EU elections.
1.1.1.3. Con: Petitions are far less effective than the highly paid lobbyists that [pervade Brussels and ensure EU legislation provides preferential treatment for big businesses](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/08/lobbyists-european-parliament-brussels-corporate) at the expense of entrepreneurs and free market competition.
1.1.2. Con: If individual countries in Europe value our work product, holiday euros and students, then they will freely grant us our current rights. If the UK feels the same way towards their work product, holiday pounds and students, then we'll no doubt do the same.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Spain has guaranteed British citizens can continue [to live there](http://www.cityam.com/274318/brexit-british-expats-spain-allowed-stay-even-if-no-deal) even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Spain is only one of the roughly 27 other member states of the EU. Most other EU states will require visas from British people and have to comply with that EU legislation. Free movement is for EU people only and if the UK leaves they will forfeit that right for the majority of member states.
1.1.2.2. Con: Open borders are unique to the EU, and made possible due to their close integration. Without being a member, getting full freedom of movement with all the individual countries in the EU will be practically impossible, and also as unlikely a political move as attempting to have open borders with, say, the US or Canada.
1.1.2.3. Con: For individual EU countries to grant the UK the same full open borders as before, the UK would have to reciprocate by opening their own borders too. This is not politically supportable for the UK, as closing down immigration was a major goal of Brexit - there won't be public desire or the political mandate to start re-opening borders.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: Public support may exist to open borders with countries more ethnically close to us, like France and Germany, but keep eastern Europeans out.
1.1.3. Con: [Brits don't particularly want to work in the EU](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2690347/Revealed-Where-5million-Brits-live-abroad-1-3million-Australia-four-emigrated-San-Marino.html). None of the top 3 countries that Brits emigrate to are in the EU \(Australia, US, Canada are top 3\), with the fourth - Spain - mainly for retirement and not work.  More than 3 times as many Brits have emigrated to New Zealand than Germany, despite Germany being much closer and much bigger.
1.1.3.1. Con: [1.3 million people](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates17.shtml) born in the UK live in other EU countries, according to 2017 estimates from the United Nations \(UN\).
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Many if not most of the UK citizens living in the EU are retirees, with [Spain by far the most popular destination](https://fullfact.org/europe/how-many-uk-citizens-live-other-eu-countries/). [The Spanish government has already said they will be able to stay in Spain](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-british-expats-stay-in-spain-no-deal-european-union-spanish-foreign-minister-alfonso-a8013546.html) even in the event of a no deal Brexit.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: This is still less than the number of Brits living in Australia alone and reinforces rather than negates the parent claim. Given the EU27 comprises 27 countries, 450 million people and 15% of global GDP, while Australia had a population and GDP about one 20th the size, this illustrates the vast preference of Brits to live in non-EU countries, which preference is greatly increased even further when retirees are discounted.
1.1.3.2. Con: This may partly be because [the most popular holidays destinations are in the EU](https://www.kialo.com/should-the-uk-remain-in-the-eu-if-the-only-alternative-is-a-hard-brexit-8708/8708.0=8708.1+8708.1011+8708.1173), and people emigrating want to take the chance to live and work somewhere new that they couldn't visit easily otherwise.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: The qualities one looks for in a holiday destination are different to those one looks for in a place to settle permanently. That people are familiar with the EU but don't want to live there suggests simply that they don't want to live there. Language and cultural barriers are far more likely reasons for Brits choosing not to live in the EU, with the exception of retirees - who are a special case of immigrant living a lifestyle more similar to that of a holidaymaker.
1.1.3.2.2. Con: Given EU countries represent the closest and cheapest travel destinations, this statistic is hardly surprising.
1.1.3.2.3. Con: America is very popular as a tourist destination \(no. 5\) but more than twice as popular for migration as the most popular EU migration destination \(Spain\).
1.1.3.3. Con: Around 900,000 UK citizens are long-term residents of other EU countries \([ONS, 2010 2011](https://fullfact.org/europe/how-many-uk-citizens-live-other-eu-countries/)\).
1.1.3.3.1. Con: [Over 250k](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/investmentspensionsandtrusts/articles/pensionersintheeuanduk/2017-09-05) of these are pensioners, who are effectively on a semi-permanent holiday.  Therefore the number of UK citizens working in the EU is at most just 650k.
1.1.3.3.2. Con: This is a very small number compared to those living in working in Australia alone.
1.1.3.3.3. Con: These are not distributed evenly across the EU, and therefore the UK would be better served by dealing with popular destinations on a bilateral basis.
1.1.3.3.3.1. Con: You can’t negotiate that with part of the EU with any real success, especially in the Schengen zone. You may want to read the basis of negotiations in this briefing. [researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/LLN-2016-0013/LLN-2016-0013.pdf)
1.1.3.4. Con: Freedom of Movement is not the same as Immigration. By definition it is the ability to move about and work anywhere within the EU.
1.1.4. Pro: Travel to Europe is extremely popular for UK residents, [11 out of the 12 top visited countries are in Europe](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/leisureandtourism/adhocs/006046top50countriesvisitedbyukresidentsandtop50overseascountrieswhovisitedtheuk). Of those top 12 countries, Europe accounts for 92.9% of travel.
1.1.4.1. Con: There is no evidence that a hard brexit will prevent Brits from being able to travel to the EU.  At worst will be a very minor administrative hurdle.
1.1.5. Con: If the British people valued those things over their sovereignty, they wouldn't have voted to leave the EU.
1.1.5.1. Con: There were a [number of lies](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/eu-referendum-claims-won-brexit-fact-checked/) told by the leave campaign. This means people may have made the decision to leave on incomplete or incorrect information.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Vote Remain said "[The UK has been outvoted every single time it has voted against EU laws](http://view.publitas.com/15010/164151/pdfs/9b3d7fac7290257c2e72c7784537315b9351806e.pdf)" but this is untrue - UK ministers were on the losing side [only 2% of the time](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-facts-behind-claims-uk-influence/).
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Both sides chose to focus on values, not the details of Britain's EU membership. Due to the Leave campaign's focus on immigration policy, [immigration became the defining issue of the referendum](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/immigration-now-top-issue-voters-eu-referendum). This means many people likely made their decision based on the Leave campaign's promises to cut immigration, rather than considering the specifics of EU policy and what leaving actually entailed.
1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: [Ashcroft's poll](https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/) taken on referendum polling day suggests the single most popular reason for the leave vote was the issue of sovereignty \(49%\). Since [polls taken on election day yield a more representative sample](https://www.ft.com/content/0e38ae9e-4a16-11e7-a3f4-c742b9791d43), it is more likely that sovereignty was the defining issue.
1.1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: [Parliamentary sovereignty](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/sovereignty/) is a principle of the UK constitution. It makes Parliament the supreme legal authority in the UK, which can create or end any law. Generally, the courts cannot overrule its legislation and no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change. Parliamentary sovereignty is the most important part of the UK constitution. Yet the hard brexiteers want to deprive Parliament of a [meaningful vote](https://amp.businessinsider.com/explained-dominic-grieve-meaningful-vote-brexit-amendment-2018-6), thus subverting their sovereignty.
1.1.5.1.2.1.2. Con: It is hard to separate votes for immigration and votes for sovereignty. Leave politicians insisted that taking back our Sovereignty was a means of restricting immigration by allowing us to "control our borders".
1.1.5.1.2.2. Con: Regardless of the defining issue for leave or remain voters \(for whom it was[the risk of leaving to economy, jobs etc.](https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/)\), it does not logically follow that EU policy and what leaving actually entailed were not given full consideration by those voters.
1.1.5.1.3. Pro: For years before the referendum lies and anti-EU propaganda had been swallowed by a large proportion of the British public. Most 'myths' were blatantly wrong. [Check them all out here.](https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/euromyths-a-z-index/)
1.1.5.1.4. Con: Lies were told on both sides, for example few of the [dire economic predictions](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/imf-peak-pessimism-brexit-eu-referendum-european-union-international-monetary-fund) of the effect of a leave vote have materialised.
1.1.5.1.4.1. Con: The predictions of immediate impact were built around several assumptions on the actions of the government and institutions such as the Bank Of England.  For example, the BoE [cut interest rates](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36976528) and offered banks [an extra £250m to borrow.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37386629) These plans were [somewhat mysterious](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/05/bank-of-england-brexit-preparations-uk-banks) so couldn't have been accounted for in any forecasting.
1.1.5.1.4.1.1. Con: It was obvious that the Bank of England would have taken some precautionary measures were the referendum to result in a Yes vote; at no point did the remain campaign claim that their disastrous economic predictions would only come to fruition if the Bank of England did nothing at all.
1.1.5.1.4.2. Con: The predictions of immediate impact also would have assumed that the Prime Minister would have triggered Article 50 immediately, based on [his answers when directly asked.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW1zZ4EufkE)
1.1.5.1.4.3. Pro: Confirmation bias means that those on the remain side focus disproportionately on the inaccuracies of the leave side and assume they had more influence than is supported by any actual evidence. At the same time, they ignore the inaccuracies in the arguments of their own side.
1.1.5.1.4.4. Con: Leave claimed that Brexit would result in increased prosperity. Remain claimed that Brexit would cause economic harm. With our GDP growth already down 2.1%, and forecast to go down 8% in total over the next 15 years in the event of a hard Brexit, it is clear that as far as the economy is concerned, Remain were [far more](https://www.ft.com/content/b3d35136-0543-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5) accurate.
1.1.5.1.4.5. Con: There is a big difference between lies and predictions. Lies were told to intentionally mislead the electorate in able to win votes. It could be argued that predictions were based on us leaving the EU and the Single Market. Neither has occurred yet.
1.1.5.1.4.6. Con: The UK has not left the EU yet \(as of 12th Feb 2018\).
1.1.5.1.4.7. Con: The effects of leaving will only materialise when we leave. This has not happened yet therefore the assertion that lies were told on both sides is incorrect
1.1.5.1.5. Con: Refusing to respect election results on the basis that another party lied would create chaos.
1.1.6. Pro: Without a deal or other residency rights, the entitlement of UK nationals to reside elsewhere in the EU could technically disappear overnight.
1.1.6.1. Con: This would be a bigger disaster for the Spanish economy than that of the UK, which would be a net beneficiary.
1.1.6.2. Pro: British tourists looking to travel Europe would most likely need [visas and security screenings](https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/904036/post-brexit-travel-passport-visa-europe-eurozone). This makes travel more costly and more difficult.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: Those visiting the UK from the EU would also have to obtain visas, making it easier to keep an accurate account of who is legally in the UK.
1.1.6.2.1.1. Con: While that may be positive for immigration, it could have a negative impact on the tourism industry in the UK.
1.1.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Tourism](https://www.visitbritain.org/visitor-economy-facts) in the UK generates 9% of the country's GDP and nearly 10% of jobs. A decline in tourists due to Brexit would damage the UK economy.
1.1.6.2.1.1.2. Pro: The additional work of procuring a visa may deter people from using the UK as a holiday destination.
1.1.6.2.1.1.3. Pro: Currently, the UK's [airline routes](http://uk.businessinsider.com/wef-tourism-competitiveness-report-brexit-impact-on-uk-tourism-2017-4) to EU and US destinations are arranged through EU agreements; a hard Brexit could call these into question.
1.1.6.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: As an island nation, transport links are highly important.
1.1.6.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: The aviation sector does not have the emergency fall-back option of World Trade Organisation rules which apply to most sectors. As a result, Brexit could [severely reduce](http://uk.businessinsider.com/wef-tourism-competitiveness-report-brexit-impact-on-uk-tourism-2017-4) the number of routes for holidaymakers, business travellers and visitors to the UK.
1.1.6.2.2. Con: British people spending money abroad through tourism is money leaving the British economy. It is better to have them vacation domestically.
1.1.6.2.3. Con: It is likely that the visa scheme will resemble [the U.S. process](https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/904036/post-brexit-travel-passport-visa-europe-eurozone) which guarantees 90 days upon entry. While this is more difficult than the status quo, [millions](https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/564537/4-million-Brits-travel-US-in-2014-record-breaking-tourism-year-Ireland-overseas-visitors) of tourists still travel from Britain to the U.S. each year.
1.1.7. Pro: Many students studying in the UK will have less exposure to employers outside of the UK, as well as lower opportunities for studying abroad
1.1.7.1. Pro: A hard Brexit would mean the end of the UK's participation in [Erasmus](https://www.wysetc.org/2017/11/what-would-a-no-deal-brexit-mean-for-the-erasmus-programme/) \(a programme of student exchanges, work, training, and teaching placements across the EU\).
1.1.8. Pro: UK nationals working in a non-EU country like Switzerland may lose significant rights.  Switzerland's arrangements with the EU will [no longer](https://www.eda.admin.ch/dea/en/home/verhandlungen-offene-themen/offene-themen/brexit.html) apply and a new Swiss-UK treaty is likely to be low on the list of priorities given how much else the UK Government needs to negotiate.
1.1.8.1. Pro: Many British cultural leaders [believe](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/31/brexit-threat-to-arts) that a hard Brexit will hurt their nation's artistic reputation, as it curtails the ability of most British artists to work freely abroad and international artists to work in the UK. This also hurts the perception of the UK as an iconic cultural hub.
1.1.8.1.1. Pro: The Creative Industries Federation \(an association of members from UK creative industries\) states that 96 per cent of its members supported remaining in the EU and 84 per cent of its members believed [the outcome of the referendum](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2016/07/what-will-brexit-mean-arts-and-culture-uk) was important to the future success of their organisations, as Brexit would result in a loss of EU funding and support for cultural programs.
1.1.8.1.2. Pro: Travel restrictions, which would result from a hard Brexit, will add large financial and logistical costs to touring companies and so prevent many British theatre companies from touring.
1.1.8.1.3. Con: Travelling won’t suddenly become impossible without the EU, and it doesn’t change anything for non-EU artists or British artists travelling outside of the EU.
1.1.8.1.4. Con: Britain’s iconic cultural hub identity is independent from the EU, as it predates it — wether you take into account London being a capital of culture in the 19th century, or the popular culture boom in the[interwar era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_Kingdom#Interwar_era_1918–1939). Believing brexit will hurt the UK as a culture hub is greatly underestimating the country’s appeal and history.
1.1.9. Pro: With the potential loss of financial passporting arrangements - UK residents in the EU face real problems in receiving pensions created within the UK. Each EU country has its own financial structures in this regard - making the situation even more complex.
1.1.10. Con: Brexit will lead to new rights to travel, work and study.
1.1.10.1. Pro: A new trade deal with India will be possible after Brexit, and may lead to improved ease of movement between the two countries.
1.1.10.1.1. Pro: India has [stated](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-australia-india-tell-uk-relax-immigration-rules-free-trade-deal-eu-visa-restrictions-a7540036.html) that it cannot separate free movement of people from the free flow of goods, services and investments, indicating that any free trade deal will likely require increased immigration from India.
1.1.10.1.1.1. Con: This statement was from "a senior Indian official", rather than an official red line. It should be seen as a posturing/bargaining point, rather than a certainty.
1.1.10.1.2. Pro: The EU prevents member states from striking their own free trade deals with third countries, so a deal opening borders with India is only possible if the UK leaves.
1.1.10.1.2.1. Pro: While within the EU, the UK [can not negotiate](http://brexitcentral.com/uk-trade-agreements-before-brexit/) its own trade deals without consensus of all the member states. This makes it far harder to strike deals with important emerging economies like China and India for example.
1.1.10.1.2.1.1. Con: The ability to do our own trade deals will only bring in an extra [0.6% GDP](https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertonardelli/the-governments-own-brexit-analysis-says-the-uk-will-be). Far less than the losses from Brexit, especially Hard Brexit.
1.1.10.1.2.1.2. Con: Trade deals tend to involve the liberalisation of immigration controls. Trade deals with [India](https://www.politico.eu/article/india-no-rush-to-do-bilateral-trade-deal-with-post-brexit-britain-commonwealth-eu-customs-union-external-tariffs/) would almost certainly increase immigration from those countries, to the displeasure of many Brexit voters.
1.1.10.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.1.
1.1.10.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: There are many different levels of trade deal. The strongest / most expansive Trade deals \(those with the [most advanced stage of economic integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_agreement#By_level_of_integration)\) include eliminating labour barriers \([Common markets, Economic Unions, Economic and Monetary Unions, and Complete economic integrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_integration#Stages)\).
1.1.10.1.2.1.2.3. Con: A very common type of trade deal is a Free Trade Area, which typically does not include "[eliminating barriers for exchange of labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_integration#Stages)".
1.1.10.1.2.1.3. Con: The EU is also looking at [partnerships](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-india-trade-germany-pushes-for-post-brexit-deal/) with India.
1.1.10.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Yet such a trade deal is [possible](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-india-trade-germany-pushes-for-post-brexit-deal/) exactly because the UK is about to leave the EU. The two demands made by India - visa liberalisation and high tariffs on foreign wines and spirits - were heavily resisted by the UK during negotiations in 2013.
1.1.10.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: The EU and India recently [adopted](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/10/06/india-summit-statements/) three joint declarations relating to counterterrorism, climate change, and sustainable development at the 14th EU-India summit.
1.1.10.1.2.1.4. Con: Without the negotiating leverage of the combined EU trade block, the UK will be unlikely to secure new trade deals on as favorable terms as it would have as a member of the EU.
1.1.10.1.2.1.4.1. Con: The UK wants free trade, as evidenced by the fact that it was a [key plank](https://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:sav235yoh/read/single#page/3/mode/1up) of the winning Leave campaign. All the protectionist conditions that the EU places on its trading partners are inherently unfavourable in the context of free trade.
1.1.10.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: A [number of countries](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-trade-partners-object-to-brexit-transition-roll-over/) which have trade deals with the EU wish to renegotiate terms of any post-Brexit deal with the UK to be more in their favour, and thus worse for the UK.
1.1.10.1.2.1.4.2.1. Con: Trade is not a zero sum game. Something that is in favour of a trading partner is not necessarily worse for the UK.
1.1.10.1.2.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: The EU charges a 16% tariff on oranges from south Africa to protect Big Spanish Orange. Oranges would be [cheaper](https://iea.org.uk/the-eus-thousands-of-senseless-tariffs-punish-the-poor/) if we left the EU and abolished this tariff, and we'd buy more south African oranges.  This is in the interests of both the UK and our trading partner south Africa.
1.1.10.1.2.1.4.3. Pro: As the UK economy is already relatively global and deregulated, Britain has [limited leverage](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-trade-deal-thatcher-impact-european-union-single-market-deregulation-a8160026.html) when it comes to negotiating free trade deals.
1.1.10.1.2.1.4.3.1. Con: The  narrative portrayed in the cited support article of Britain wanting to "dictate terms" and "have leverage" in trade negotiations is inherently false. Britain wants to pursue a free trade agenda. Protectionist attempts to dictate terms and use leverage are things that protectionist blocs like the EU do. Brexit is an opportunity to trade with the world unfettered by such chains.
1.1.10.1.2.1.4.3.1.1. Con: Wanting unfettered access to all world markets is all well and good, getting such access is entirely another thing, and [not](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/12/20/business/post-brexit-britain-may-struggle-top-japan-eu-free-trade-deal/) [very](http://uk.businessinsider.com/brexit-trump-global-trade-war-uk-trade-deal-almost-impossible-2018-3) [likely](http://uk.businessinsider.com/ambassador-charles-ries-why-a-uk-us-trade-deal-will-be-difficult-2018-1).
1.1.10.1.2.1.4.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.2.1.4.1.
1.1.10.1.3. Con: The UK already has the ability to open up borders with India, whilst staying in the EU.
1.1.10.1.3.1. Pro: EU rules prevent the UK from negotiating new trade deals, but do not stop the UK from administrating it's own visa/immigration policies.
1.1.10.1.3.2. Con: India recently stated that they cannot separate free trade from free movement. As the UK is not allowed to offer free trade with India under EU rules, India would therefore not accept freedom of movement.
1.1.10.1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.1.
1.1.10.1.3.2.2. Con: This statement was in the context of a post-brexit trade deal. If the UK had offered open borders with India whilst still in the EU, with no strings attached, it is likely they would have accepted. It shouldn't be taken as saying that increasing freedom of movement between the countries would have been impossible if it was negotiated whilst within the EU, as the contexts would be very different.
1.1.10.1.3.3. Pro: There is no political desire in the UK to open borders with India, which is why the UK has not yet attempted to do it.
1.1.10.1.4. Con: This is not a direct effect of Brexit, rather part of a negative consequence of it, as open trade with India is a concession the Indians are demanding the UK makes to sign any trade deal. It is tenuous to say that Brexit would be the cause of open travel with India - rather the Indian governments negotiating position would be the cause.
1.1.10.2. Con: The increase of xenophobic, anti-immigrant sentiment throughout the UK is a barrier to opening up borders.
1.1.10.2.1. Pro: The Brexit campaign resulted in a significant increase of expressions of xenophobia and racism, which may make it harder for the UK to attract foreign workers.
1.1.10.2.1.1. Pro: The government has a policy of creating a [hostile environment](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmhaff/421/42106.htm) for illegal immigrants which will be extended to include [EU citizens](https://www.the3million.org.uk/hostile-environment).
1.1.10.2.1.1.1. Con: EU citizens who choose to break our laws and come here illegally should find a hostile environment.
1.1.10.2.1.2. Con: Making it more difficult to attract foreign skilled workers will encourage the public and private sectors to invest more in training UK residents.
1.1.10.2.1.3. Con: An exodus of skilled workers from foreign countries can lead to a brain drain in those countries, negatively affecting their development.
1.1.10.2.1.4. Pro: A [UN special report](https://ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23074&LangID=E) said that Brexit has contributed to an environment of increased racial discrimination and intolerance, and has made [racial and ethnic minorities more vulnerable](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/11/uk-has-seen-brexit-related-growth-in-racism-says-un-representative) to racial discrimination and intolerance.
1.1.10.2.1.5. Pro: Police figures obtained through Freedom of Information \(FOI\) requests show [incidents surged by 23 per cent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/racist-hate-crimes-surge-to-record-high-after-brexit-vote-new-figures-reveal-a7829551.html) – from 40,741 to 49,921 – in the 11 months after the EU referendum, compared with the same period the previous year. This is the highest spike in religious and racial hate crimes ever recorded.
1.1.10.2.1.6. Pro: The UK's Home Office confirmed victims’ reports of a [dramatic increase in incidents](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/hate-crimes-eu-referendum-spike-brexit-terror-attacks-police-home-office-europeans-xenophobia-a8004716.html) motivated by attackers’ hostility towards their race, nationality, religion or other factors.
1.1.10.2.1.6.1. Con: A home office spokesperson said that the increase was thought to also be due to ongoing [improvements in crime recording](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/hate-crimes-eu-referendum-spike-brexit-terror-attacks-police-home-office-europeans-xenophobia-a8004716.html) by the police.
1.1.10.2.1.7. Con: This is a temporary effect, not a long lasting change in UK racism.
1.1.10.2.1.7.1. Pro: The increase was due to the widespread public debate. Debate will significantly lessen once we leave \(or remain\), and therefore tension within the British public will lessen.
1.1.10.2.1.7.2. Con: There has been a [large](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/revealed-antimuslim-hate-crimes-in-london-soared-by-40-in-a-year-a3775751.html) [rise](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/20/record-number-anti-muslim-attacks-reported-uk-2017) in hate crimes against muslims \(26% rise in 2017\) and people from other non-EU backgrounds. After brexit these groups are not going to decrease in size \(if anything we will see a rise in commonwealth migrants\) even though the expectation among brexiteers is that migration will fall. This disillusionment quite possibly will lead to further increases in bigotry and racism
1.1.10.2.1.8. Pro: Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Service have warned of a “[real possibility](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/19/brexit-will-trigger-rise-in-hate-crimes-warns-police-watchdog)” that Britain’s exit from the European Union next year will trigger a spike in hate crimes.
1.1.10.2.1.9. Con: Comparing attitudes before and after the referendum from within the same groups of individuals suggests that both Leavers and Remainers have [softened in their attitudes towards immigration](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-of-concern/).
1.1.10.2.1.9.1. Pro: This has been quantified at 19% softening over 4 years. Inconsistent question wording makes historical comparisons difficult, but good Ipsos MORI data since 2013 suggests that there has been a recent softening of attitudes with just 45% agreeing that there are too many immigrants in 2017 compared to 64% just 4 years earlier. [Figure 2](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-of-concern/#kp3)
1.1.10.2.2. Pro: Without high levels of pro-immigrant sentiment politicians are unlikely to suggest opening borders, because they want to appeal to voters to get re-elected.
1.1.10.2.3. Pro: Theoretically, a democracy acts based on the will of the population. If the will of a population moves away from more immigration, then their government will also move away from increasing immigration.
1.1.10.2.4. Pro: When negotiating freedom of movement deals with a country, violence and xenophobic attacks against the people of one country by the people of the other will lessen the desire for the attacked country to want freedom of movement to the attacking country. The danger makes freedom of movement less important on the attacked countries agenda, and makes them less likely to support or push for freedom of movement for it's citizens.
1.1.10.2.5. Con: The Brexit related increase in xenophobic and anti-immigrant sentiment will fade in time. By the time the UK is making new trade/migration deals, the prevalence will have dropped, and won't be a factor.
1.1.10.2.6. Con: Any increase of serious xenophobia/anti-immigrant acts is likely attributable to the most extreme part of the population, and a result of Brexit giving them a reason to act on their extreme views. The general moderate population of the UK was unlikely to be as affected as this extreme minority.
1.1.10.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.2.1.9.
1.1.11. Con: The right to move and work throughout Europe will not be removed, but will be returned to a more typical visa process: this was a known quantity during the referendum, and as such is not relevant.
1.2. Pro: A hard Brexit would threaten the UK's domestic security with respect to crime, terrorism and the rule of law.
1.2.1. Con: The UK's primary domestic security is as a result of its nuclear capability because mutually-assured-destruction is the cause of major nations not waging war directly with each other since WW2. Rather than membership of the EU, it's the UK's [relationship](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/defence-and-security-blog/2014/jul/01/trident-nuclear-weapons-uk) with the USA that is important, as they design and build the nuclear weapons systems the UK uses.
1.2.2. Pro: The European Arrest Warrants, which [rely](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/eu-home-affairs-subcommittee/news-parliament-2017/arrest-warrant-government-response/) on the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union, have reduced the time taken to extradite criminals [from 1 year to just 48 days](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23239493).
1.2.2.1. Con: Refusing to sign an extradition treaty with the UK to effectively preserve the present system would be an example of the EU acting maliciously against the interests of its own citizens. It is right to leave a club as nasty as to endanger lives of its own people rather than compromise with a close ally.
1.2.2.2. Pro: While there are some theoretical alternatives to European Arrest Warrants which could be as efficient, these have [not been](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/eu-home-affairs-subcommittee/news-parliament-2017/arrest-warrant-government-response/) successfully implemented despite years of negotiation.
1.2.2.3. Con: This arrangement need not be dependent on the wide-scale political and economic union that the EU entails. Britain could leave the EU in its totality and then make a bilateral agreement with the EU, which closely resembles the current arrangement. It would be mutually beneficial for the EU and UK to make such an agreement.
1.2.3. Pro: In 2016, UK agencies launched [3,000 investigations](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39272921) at Europol \(the [EU's law enforcement agency](https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/our-thinking)\) into cross-border organised crime and terrorism.
1.2.3.1. Con: Refusing to allow Europol to work with the UK would be an example of the EU acting maliciously against the interests of its own citizens. It is right to leave a club as nasty as to endanger lives of its own people rather than compromise with a close ally.
1.2.3.2. Con: Europol is not crucial in combating terrorism as Intelligence Agencies [rarely share](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39272921) this kind of sensitive information via this avenue.
1.2.4. Pro: A hard Brexit would be particularly dangerous as it might threaten access to some [essential](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39272921) systems such as the [Second Generation Schengen Information System](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen-information-system_en), which is a key tool in countering terrorism.
1.2.4.1. Con: Losing access would be an example of the EU acting maliciously against the interests of its own citizens.  It is right to leave a club as nasty as to endanger lives of its own people rather than compromise with a close ally.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: Many aspects of EU counter-terrorism is subject to EU law governed by the ECJ. It would simply be illegal under current EU laws to share information covered by data protection with 3rd nations. Brexit was a vote to become a 3rd nation not subject by EU laws, thus we have voted to [exclude](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/12/britain-falling-behind-eu-terror-fight) ourselves from the sharing of counter-terrorism information.
1.2.4.2. Pro: This system is accessible to individual police officers on the street, and allowed them to identify [over 6,000](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/77/7706.htm) people of interest \(missing, organised crime, etc.\) in the UK between April 2015 and March 2016.
1.2.4.3. Pro: [Counter terrorism](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/77/7706.htm) alerts, which are more discrete than the regular police ones, can also be entered into the system.
1.2.4.4. Pro: This system holds the details of [over 8,000](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/13/brexit-may-britain-terrorists-schengen-information-system) suspected members of ISIS, making it invaluable when it comes to tracking returning foreign fighters.
1.2.4.5. Con: The article quoted says Britain would be unlikely to lose access to these systems: "But shutting Britain out of this club would be counter-productive for the rest of Europe, so officers are confident it will be retained after Brexit."
1.3. Con: The bureaucratic and elected institutions of the EU [demonstrate a distinct lack of ethnic diversity](https://www.dawn.com/news/1388420), particularly when UK-originating MEPs/employees are excluded. Those who support diversity and intersectionality should not want to be associated with such a structurally ethnonormative and patriarchal organisation.
1.3.1. Con: The EU has been a driver of equality policy in Europe.
1.3.1.1. Pro: The UK has introduced many of its equality measures as a result of EU initiatives.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: The UK is heavily represented at the EU, and played a key role in the drafting of these equality measures. In the vast majority of cases, the UK would likely have drawn up similar protections had it been outside the EU.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Whilst the British Government seeks to replicate most EU laws for ease of trading, it refuses to protect EU laws on human rights, offering '[basic rights](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-mps-vote-against-including-european-fundamental-rights-charter-in-uk-law-a8162981.html)' instead.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: The Equality Act 2010 is the piece of UK legislation which protects people in the workplace and wider society from discrimination on various grounds \(including age, disability, race and sexual orientation\). It [implements four major EU Equal Treatment Directives](https://rightsinfo.org/10-times-european-union-made-difference-human-rights/).
1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: The UK may have created the same rules as the four "Equal Treatment Directives" by themselves, if the EU had not made them first.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: The British [Equality and Human Rights Commission](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/about-us/who-we-are) claims that [EU law has led to changes in UK law](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-human-rights-work/what-does-brexit-mean-equality-and-human-rights-uk), which protect equality and human rights. These include data protection, human trafficking, disability rights, workplace discrimination, and equal pay.
1.3.1.2. Con: The UK consistently has the lowest rates of discrimination across the EU, showing that it is not the EU per se that should take credit for high equality, but rather British governments, courts and society in general. See e.g. [figure 5 here](http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2017-eu-midis-ii-main-results_en.pdf)
1.3.1.3. Con: It is the [UK that has been a driver](https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-diversity-exits-the-eu-brussels/) of equality policy in the EU, not the reverse.
1.3.1.4. Pro: The UK has strong equality policies.  By being part of a larger community it can push those policies even further, to affect more people.
1.3.1.4.1. Con: The UK can lead by example just as effectively, if not more effectively, outside the EU where it is not seeking to impose laws on other countries.
1.3.1.4.2. Con: Even if it were true that the UK wants to push equality policies further, and given the [backlash against political correctness](https://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/martin-townsend/772180/trevor-phillips-political-correctness-documentary-channel-4-gone-mad) this is unsubstantiated, it is not at all clear that the UK should seek to legally impose those policies on other countries.
1.3.1.5. Pro: The EU may in fact protect the citizens of the UK, through legal oversight, from the negative effects of poor policy making or implementation. Vulnerable and marginalised groups [have used](https://academic.oup.com/ejil/article/28/3/763/4616672#100347677) the European Court of Justice to bring numerous claims against the British Government for human rights abuses.
1.3.1.5.1. Con: Those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety. [Benjamin Franklin \(1706-1790\)](http://wisdomquotes.com/liberty-safety-benjamin-franklin/)
1.3.1.5.2. Pro: The EU has created [many directives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_labour_law#Equality) which encourage equal opportunities for ethnic minorities across Europe.
1.3.1.5.2.1. Pro: The EUs [European Convention on Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights#Article_14_%E2%80%93_discrimination) is a key legislation for preventing gender/ethnic discrimination, amongst many other similar areas.
1.3.1.5.2.1.1. Con: The ECHR is enforced by the Council of Europe, which is a completely different organisation to the EU.  The [UK will still be signed up to the ECHR](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-human-rights-work/what-does-brexit-mean-equality-and-human-rights-uk) when it leaves the EU.
1.3.1.5.2.2. Con: The EU bureaucratic hierarchy doesn't reflect equal opportunities based on gender or ethnicity, suggesting that it does not take equal opportunities seriously.
1.3.1.5.2.3. Pro: The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides some [Human Rights which would be lost](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-human-rights-work/what-does-brexit-mean-equality-and-human-rights-uk) if we leave the EU as proposed under the [Repeal Bill](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-repeal-bill-white-paper).
1.3.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.5.2.
1.3.2. Con: This is a global problem that is not unique to these institutions, and therefore not a reason to leave the EU.
1.3.2.1. Pro: [The UK has only had](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom#Since_1721) 2 \(out of 75\) female prime ministers since 1721. \(Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May\).
1.3.2.1.1. Con: The UK has had a series of incredibly well respected and powerful queens who ruled as head of state since [1558](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England).
1.3.2.1.2. Con: Over the last 40 years, the UK has had a female prime minister for [13 of those years](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom), which is over 30% of the time. The EU has had female Presidents for zero of those years.
1.3.2.2. Con: The EU bureaucracy is a particularly bad example, which is paying lip service to the problem while continuing in the same worrying vein [favouring white men over woman and ethnic minorities for positions of real power](https://www.politico.eu/article/the-european-commission-gender-equality-6-men-no-women-promoted-to-top-eurocrat-grade/).  As the unelected bureaucratic body which in some respects wields more power than the UK parliament,  we should not accept its power until it has genuinely reformed.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: The seven different 'Presidents' of the EU are all [white and male](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_institutions_of_the_European_Union).
1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: This is not an EU issue, the EU is relatively young, compare the EU to other diplomatic organisations. Britain has had no prime ministers of colour and only two women in it's history.
1.3.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.3.2.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.
1.3.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: The UK has only had white prime ministers.
1.3.2.2.1.1.3.1. Con: The UK had its first ethnic minority Prime Minister and first person from an ethnic minority background to hold one of the Great Offices of State in [1868](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli).
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: The EU has been [accused of being blind to](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/27/eu-criticised-leaving-out-ethnic-minorities-diversity-drive) [ethnic minorities](https://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-blind-to-diversity-whiteout-european-parliament/).
1.3.2.2.3. Pro: Currently only [1.6% of the 751 MEPs are from ethnic minorities](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/11/brexit-betrayal-uk-fight-equality-isolationism-anti-discrimination), and around half \(around 6 MEPs\) are from the UK.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: The total number of national minority populations in Europe is estimated at 105 million people, or 14% of 770 million Europeans. This is different to the EU, but shows that there is likely an imbalance of 12.4% between the ethnic population and ethnic representation by MEPs.
1.3.2.2.4. Con: The best way to influence change in the organisation is by being a member.
1.3.2.2.4.1. Pro: Britain will have significantly less influence in Europe if it leaves the EU, and as a result will be a weaker nation in the international community.
1.3.2.2.4.1.1. Con: Influence is complex and multifactorial, and therefore challenging to predict. The view that the UK's post-Brexit future influence will wane may therefore reflect cognitive bias.
1.3.2.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: Given the size of the UK economy, the EU may be forced to respond to unilateral decisions taken by the UK.
1.3.2.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: Agreements reached between the UK and other countries may directly influence EU policy.
1.3.2.2.4.1.1.3. Con: As a member of the EU the UK has a veto in many important areas of policy, and a vote in many more. It's nonsensical to suggest that losing veto power can add influence.
1.3.2.2.4.1.1.3.1. Con: It isn't nonsensical at all - the EU bureaucratic behemoth does not exist in a vacuum. The UK does not need to be enslaved within the EU treaties to lead by example and influence decision making. Further, the UK is set to have [one of the largest diplomatic footprints in Brussels](https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-europe-britain-moves-big-into-brussels/).
1.3.2.2.4.1.1.3.2. Con: It is not nonsensical that veto only effects european policy and there is plenty we do not have a veto over. We won't have to participate in any schemes or follow any rules we don't want to in the event of no deal. In most instances there are other international bodies that the uk has a major role in anyway. For example: the UN, NATO, WTO etc. Furthermore we still represent a major economic power and can therefore leverage that on some matters to influence other nations still in the eu.
1.3.2.2.4.1.1.3.2.1. Con: The grand parent claim states that influence will increase, not that the UK will retain influence.
1.3.2.2.4.1.2. Pro: The UK owns a market composed of 65 million people; the USA owns a market composed of 300 million people; the EU owns a market composed of 500 million people; China owns a market composed of 1 billion people: the larger your market is, the more powerful you are. Outside the EU, the UK will lose its bargaining power.
1.3.2.2.4.1.2.1. Con: Currently this is true but it must be asked how will the EU fare in the rest of this century. It has major fiscal problems, economies at hugely different speeds, great immigration issues, structural uncompetitiveness, bitterness over Greece, independence movements and populism increasing. The UK benefited from peak Europe but the past is not a guarantee of the future.
1.3.2.2.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Europe isn't perfect, but its problems can be solved. However, these problems can't be solved independently by any of the nations who now are part of the EU, instead they require the cooperation of the whole Union. For example, we can talk about immigration; no nation can solve it on its own, we need to cooperate.
1.3.2.2.4.1.2.1.2. Con: The EU isn't going to face an economic decline: instead, the EU is signing new advantageous deals with [Canada](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/) and [Japan](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/eu-japan-economic-partnership-agreement/).
1.3.2.2.4.1.2.1.3. Con: If the Multi-Speed Europe proposal was implemented, which has been suggested by some leaders, each nation [could integrate itself with other European nations at its own speed](https://www.debatingeurope.eu/focus/arguments-for-and-against-a-multi-speed-europe/#.W2GJEdIzbIU).
1.3.2.2.4.1.2.1.4. Con: Independence movements can be solved through a federal system; if the United States of Europe is the final goal of the  EU, independence movements are excellent: smaller nations need big structures in order to gain bargaining power.
1.3.2.2.4.1.2.1.5. Pro: The [surge in popularity](http://www.cityam.com/288164/italy-poland-eus-federalist-project-starting-rip-apart) in Eurosceptic political parties across Europe suggests the discontent with the EU expressed by the Brexit referendum is widespread across the EU.
1.3.2.2.4.1.2.1.6. Con: The EU is trying to integrate the different European economies with specific cohesion funds. [www.eib.org](http://www.eib.org/en/projects/regions/european-union/index.htm) [ec.europa.eu](http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/funding/cohesion-fund/)
1.3.2.2.4.1.2.2. Con: Economy size is only one metric of how much other countries want to trade with you. The other important metric is ease of doing business.  The UK together with the US are the [only G7 countries that make the top 10 list](http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/global-reports/~/media/WBG/DoingBusiness/Documents/Annual-Reports/English/DB18-Chapters/DB18-Overview.pdf), indicating how desirable the UK economy is and how much other countries will want to do business with us. Germany only ranks 20th, France 31st and Italy 46th. The UK is both very big and a very easy place to do business.
1.3.2.2.4.1.2.2.1. Con: Of course it is, but think about losing all the facilities that the EU offers to the UK \(for example, [two european agencies](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/relocation-london-agencies-brexit/)\), and also think about all the cuts prepared by the English government. We can't be sure the UK will keep being a good place to do business.
1.3.2.2.4.1.2.2.1.1. Con: It is the UK and not the EU that has made the UK a good place to do business, therefore fear mongering about what a future UK government may do outside of the EU is misguided.
1.3.2.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Brexit is making the UK a less good place to do [business](https://www.verdict.co.uk/which-companies-could-leave-the-uk-because-of-brexit/).
1.3.2.2.4.1.3. Con: Britain's soft-power and diplomatic relations with the commonwealth, the Anglosphere and many other nations outside the EU make it if not the pre-eminent global soft-power, then a close second or third. A [report](https://softpower30.com) by Portland, a communications strategy firm working for governments and large corporations currently has the UK as No.1 for example. This makes the UK well placed to weather the transition, and suggests a hard Brexit would not meaningfully affect its influence.
1.3.2.2.4.1.4. Pro: Having a large say in the EU has allowed the UK to shape the policy interests of a larger and more powerful entity, giving Britain more influence on the international stage. Withdrawing from this position would likely reverse these effects, reducing British influence.
1.3.2.2.4.1.4.1. Con: The UKs influence is derived as much from our global 'soft power' and alliance with the United States as anything else. The UK's ability to project hard power comes from its status as a nuclear power. The UK's status as a 'bridge' between the US and EU is much overhyped - witness the recent trade dispute of which the UK is merely a bystander. Freed from the EU, the UK can critique the EUs tendency to exploit its trade power with the global south.
1.3.2.2.4.1.4.2. Pro: Baroness Ashton, a British Labour peer, was the first [High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Representative_of_the_Union_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Security_Policy#Catherine_Ashton_\(2009%E2%80%9314\)), the most senior foreign affairs official in the EU following the Treaty of Lisbon.
1.3.2.2.4.1.4.3. Pro: Not having a say within the EU could reduce the UK's leverage with Washington. The US [currently](http://www.cer.eu/insights/impact-brexit-eu) sees the UK as a bridge between themselves and continental Europe.
1.3.2.2.4.1.4.4. Pro: EU membership has enabled Britain to pursue critical foreign policy objectives as part of a more formidable bloc, such as confronting Russia over its actions in Ukraine or addressing the Iran nuclear program.
1.3.2.2.4.1.4.4.1. Pro: Britain has been the most vocal supporter within the EU of sanctions against Russia, [according](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/26/brexit-is-good-news-for-russia-but-a-headache-for-nato/) to Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin.
1.3.2.2.4.1.4.5. Pro: While within the EU, Britain has sizable representation in the European parliament \([73 seats](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/en/your-meps/european_elections.html)\), as well as throughout all EU institutions.
1.3.2.2.4.1.5. Pro: Leaving the EU would mean the UK probably could not go back if Brexit was a total disaster. Remaining would mean the UK could still leave if membership proved to get worse in the future. The best option is to stay and use veto to agitate for change and improve the EU as a full, key member.
1.3.2.2.4.1.6. Pro: In the event of a hard Brexit, Britain will overnight be excluded from EU arrangements with “third countries”, or non-EU countries, entering the equivalent of a legal void in key parts of its external commercial relations. This exclusion will mean that the UK will have to [renegotiate](https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) 759 treaties.
1.3.2.2.4.1.6.1. Pro: 295 of these treaties are [trade treaties](https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e), leaving in limbo countless businesses who will not know what rules govern trading relations between the UK and other countries.
1.3.2.2.4.1.6.2. Pro: Each agreement has to be reviewed, the country approached, the decision makers found, meetings arranged, trips made, negotiations started and completed. This will take up considerable time and resources of the British government, where some treaties may not be negotiated in time for Brexit.
1.3.2.2.4.1.6.2.1. Pro: Many countries want to know the outcome of EU-UK talks [before](https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) making their own commitments to the UK, ensuring that their won't in fact be treaties signed with some non-EU nations by the time a hard Brexit occurs.
1.3.2.2.4.1.6.3. Pro: Multi-lateral agreements based on consensus also need to be renegotiated, where Britain must [re-approach](https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) 132 separate parties.
1.3.2.2.4.1.6.4. Con: The UK is trying to [secure](https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) transition agreements that will minimise disruption to trade after Brexit, allowing breathing room for old deals to be renegotiated and new ones to be made.
1.3.2.2.4.1.6.4.1. Pro: The UK has secured a [one year transitional period](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-politics-43456502)  \(Brexit day to 31 December 2020\).
1.3.2.2.4.1.6.4.1.1. Con: The EU27 may extend the transition period and [require Britain to refrain](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-trade-deals-liam-fox-two-years-veto-michel-barnier-negotiating-guidelines-a8160996.html) from implementing any independent trade deals for two years after Brexit.
1.3.2.2.4.1.6.4.2. Con: There will not be any [automatic](https://euobserver.com/uk-referendum/140571) roll-over of EU trade deals for the UK during the post-Brexit transition period, unless the EU negotiates them individually with non-EU states. It is unlikely the EU will taken on this burden, or be able to complete the negotiations for all the treaties in the limited time remaining.
1.3.2.2.4.1.7. Con: Instead of being represented by the EU, as one of 28, the United Kingdom will represent her interests directly at various organisations such as WTO. Although it could be argued that a UK seat would be able to exert less power than an EU one, the UK would always be pursuing its own objectives and not those of the majority of 28 countries whose interests don't always align. The result would be a stronger nation in the international community in real terms.
1.3.2.2.4.1.7.1. Con: The UK as a nation that has the backing of the EU and all its 28 countries is more influential then as a single nation.
1.3.2.2.4.1.8. Con: Britain's foreign policy focus on Europe crowds out its ability to pursue partnerships with the [commonwealth](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/769151/Commonwealth-rebirth-Brexit-Britain-shun-EU-Queen-countries-Article-50-trade).
1.3.2.2.4.1.8.1. Con: The commonwealth is a far less politically influential actor to be allied with than the EU.
1.3.2.2.4.1.8.1.1. Con: The commonwealth as a group is not, but individual countries in it are — Australia, Canada, India, South Africa, etc.
1.3.2.2.4.1.8.2. Con: The commonwealth is currently far less unified than the EU, making joint decisions on foreign policy far more difficult.
1.3.2.2.4.1.8.2.1. Pro: The commonwealth is comprised of 52 member states, none of which have any greater decision-making power than the other. This hinders Britain's ability to impose its political will on those nations.
1.3.2.2.4.1.8.2.2. Con: Because it’s not the same goal. Precisely what is criticized in the EU is the amount of control and influence it has on national politics.
1.3.2.2.4.1.8.3. Con: The UK already holds significant political influence with commonwealth states.
1.3.2.2.4.1.8.3.1. Con: The UK has come under criticism by Commonwealth nations in recent years due to its imperialist legacy, with prominent political parties in South Africa [boycotting](https://buzzsouthafrica.com/blacks-are-illiterates-unemployed-and-dying-because-of-whites/) Commonwealth conferences and traditions such as the Commonwealth games coming under [attack](http://allafrica.com/stories/201611240193.html). The political atmosphere makes future cooperation more difficult.
1.3.2.2.4.1.8.3.2. Pro: The commonwealth's [headquarters](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-16842428) are in London.
1.3.2.2.4.1.8.3.3. Pro: Of the commonwealth member states, Britain [provides](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2017/02/commonwealth-global-britain-sounds-nostalgia-something-else) the most funds.
1.3.2.2.4.1.8.4. Pro: The commonwealth in total has a larger [GDP than the EU](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2017/01/26/how-the-commonwealth-can-help-britain-beat-the-brexit-blues/#42e007b179c6) and is rapidly growing.
1.3.2.2.4.1.8.5. Pro: The combined population of the commonwealth is [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) than that of the EU.
1.3.2.2.4.1.8.6. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.2.1.3.
1.3.2.2.4.1.8.7. Con: In the status quo, Britain acts as a voice for the Commonwealth countries' interests within the EU. Commonwealth states in the African, Caribbean, and Pacific Group \(ACP\) benefit particularly from this arrangement, which has [led](https://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/the-commonwealth-a-dormant-giant-looks-towards-the-post-brexit-future-1.672397) to beneficial trade deals with the EU as a whole based on their historic association with Britain. Brexit robs these countries of their primary advocate in the bloc.
1.3.2.2.4.1.8.8. Con: The Caribbean nations depend heavily on tariff-free trade with Britain under the Economic Partnership Agreement. A hard Brexit would leave [little time](http://www.ramphalinstitute.org/uploads/2/3/9/9/23993131/caribbean_hangover.pdf) to renegotiate this, harming British-Caribbean relations.
1.3.2.2.4.1.8.8.1. Con: If it's an agreement already in place with the EU then they have the opportunity to agree it continues as it currently exists with the UK on a bilateral basis until something new is negotiated.
1.3.2.2.4.1.9. Pro: A hard Brexit will adversely affect the interests of countries outside of Europe, leading to a fall in Britain's standing within the international community.
1.3.2.2.4.1.9.1. Pro: The possibility of a hard Brexit has already thrown a trade deal with African states into question, adversely affecting [Kenya's flower exports](https://www.ft.com/content/01beeb54-5347-11e6-9664-e0bdc13c3bef) to the EU, a major part of its economy.
1.3.2.2.4.1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.8.8.
1.3.2.2.4.1.10. Con: The EU has shaped British foreign policy more than Britain has shaped European foreign policy. Speaking with an independent voice will give the UK the ability to lead by example and forge new partnerships rather than continually compromise with other EU countries.
1.3.2.2.4.1.10.1. Pro: Due to its large population and dominating economy, Germany has had [major influence](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-germany-influence-insight/insight-merkels-europe-how-her-men-run-brussels-idUSBRE99N05320131024) over the vast majority of EU policies, much to the [dissatisfaction](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/796149/Eurozone-EU-dominance-Brussels-France-Germany-Merkel-Macron) of other member states.
1.3.2.2.4.1.10.1.1. Con: The same could be said about British politics, where labour and conservative political parties have major control and influence, to the dissatisfaction of other parties/independants.
1.3.2.2.4.1.10.1.2. Pro: Germany has been the principal [force](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/31/growth-decide-eurozones-future-greek) behind EU austerity measures throughout the Eurozone, particularly in Greece.
1.3.2.2.4.1.10.1.2.1. Con: Greece has a huge culture of [Tax Evasion](https://www.dianeosis.org/en/2016/06/tax-evasion-in-greece/) which it has been reluctant to tackle, as well as hiding its [debt](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16834815) from the EU when it joined. The EU could not afford to continue bailing out Greece to the cost of other nation states including Britain when it made no real attempt at tackling it's own economic problems.
1.3.2.2.4.1.10.1.3. Con: Influence or soft power might differ among EU member states, but each EU member state has only one vote in the EU Council and European Council. Therefore decisions are taken democratically with a consent of majority member states.
1.3.2.2.4.1.10.2. Con: As a member of the EU, Britain has always tried to adopt a [foreign policy](http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/72665) that would ensure a balance of power in continental Europe.
1.3.2.2.4.1.11. Con: Britain is still in NATO, giving it many forums and connections for security policy coordination.
1.3.2.2.4.1.11.1. Con: As a result of Brexit, the UK is at risk of losing its [most senior held position](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-latest-news-uk-lose-most-senior-nato-military-position-eu-european-union-deputy-supreme-a7519196.html) in NATO.
1.3.2.2.4.1.11.2. Pro: Because Brexit means that the UK will no longer have to support EU military endeavors, they will have [more](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/25/europes-loss-is-natos-gain/) martial resources to deploy in the service of NATO. This additional support ensures that Britain remains able to access NATO resources and maintain its standing outside the EU.
1.3.2.2.4.1.11.3. Con: The Trump Administration has consistently [expressed doubts](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2017/12/trump_went_back_to_nato_bashing_in_pensacola_speech.html) about the future of the alliance, making it an unreliable plan for British security moving forward.
1.3.2.2.4.1.11.3.1. Con: Despite recent rhetorical grandstanding, the United States has taken [concrete steps](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/29/trumps-shadow-hangs-over-nato-transatlantic-alliance-europe-defense-deterrence-europe-mattis-jens-stoltenberg/) to continue to support the alliance.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12. Con: Remaining in the EU would harm our democracy and humiliate the UK on the world stage.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.1. Con: Remaining could correspond to the democratic will \(expressed through a vote, through parliament, …\)
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.2. Con: Leaving in a way which is harmful to the UK may do even more damage to the UK's reputation.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.3. Con: Both remaining or leaving might harm democracy, and the UK is already humiliated by an incompetent negotiating team. Concerning 'humiliation on the world stage', What could be more humiliating for 'The Mother of Parliaments' and 'The home of Democracy', than the spectacle of an undemocratic government railroading through a decision that the population now probably regrets but will have been denied the democratic right to recant/confirm a possible 'No deal', bail out without a parachute. [Poll](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-poll-voters-eu-leave-wrong-theresa-may-negotiations-deal-yougov-a8383826.html)
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4. Pro: The British public voted to leave the EU. Democratic will requires that the outcome of the referendum must be respected, thus the UK must leave the EU regardless of the deal secured.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.1. Con: The Leave campaign would have demanded [a second referendum](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36306681) had Remain won by a narrow margin; given the narrow win for Leave, a second referendum should still happen
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.1.1. Pro: Polls suggest that Britons support a 2nd referendum by as much as [16%](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/26/britons-favour-second-referendum-brexit-icm-poll), and there is [still time](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-referendum-second-campaign-mps-signatures-best-for-britain-a8389396.html) to allow voters to decide due to a lack of understanding of the true repercussions.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.1.2. Pro: Many Leave politicians [previously](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/final-say-brexit-latest-conservative-mp-explain-speeches-second-referendum-a8477686.html) [suggested](https://dominiccummings.com/2015/06/23/on-the-referendum-6-exit-plans-and-a-second-referendum/) that there should be a second referendum on the final terms of Brexit, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, David Davis, John Redwood, Nigel Farage and Vote Leave campaign director himself, Dominic Cummings.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.1.3. Pro: Data suggests there is popular [support](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/26/britons-favour-second-referendum-brexit-icm-poll) for a second referendum once the Brexit terms are revealed.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.1.3.1. Pro: In 2015, Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings admitted before the referendum that defining Brexit would lose votes and that even Eurosceptic MPs could not agree on what Brexit should entail. He [proposed](https://dominiccummings.com/2015/06/23/on-the-referendum-6-exit-plans-and-a-second-referendum/) a referendum on the final deal himself to gain public consensus.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.1.3.2. Pro: A second referendum or a Brexit-focused vote, specifically on the deal the UK ends up with, possibly with an option to stay, would not necessarily undermine the will of the people. It may in fact strengthen it. It can be explained as a further exercise of democracy, and if so explained, not undermine citizens' belief in democracy at all.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.1.3.3. Pro: Even Nigel Farage has come out in [support](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/01/11/nigel-farage-suggests-uk-may-need-second-brexit-referendum-settle/) of a second referendum.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2. Con: The WTO governed trade relationship with the EU in the event of no deal would not represent an outcome that the electorate voted for.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.1. Pro: Vote Leave - [the official Brexit campaign](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/vote-leave-eu-referendum_uk_570e5074e4b00ed33e06b5f4) - clearly stated that there would be a deal.  It is clear from the second paragraph of[the "About The Campaign" section of their website](http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/campaign.html), and from page 10 of the Vote Leave ["Why Vote Leave" document.](http://view.publitas.com/15010/164151/pdfs/9b3d7fac7290257c2e72c7784537315b9351806e.pdf).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.1.1. Con: It is [predicted](https://www.conservativehome.com/video/2017/11/watch-ici-londres-britain-has-nothing-to-fear-from-trading-with-the-eu-on-wto-terms.html) that trading on WTO terms will, as a worst case scenario,  result in a less than a 2% decrease in trade with the EU which is 0.25% of GDP.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.2. Pro: Though it is not as explicit as Vote Leave, the other prominent Brexit campaign group - Leave.EU - clearly states [their vision](https://leave.eu/about/) that includes some kind of continued relationship with the EU, and explicitly lists Norway-plus and Canada models as options.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.3. Pro: Vote Leave said "we will [negotiate the terms of a new deal before we start any legal process to leave](http://view.publitas.com/15010/164151/pdfs/9b3d7fac7290257c2e72c7784537315b9351806e.pdf)".
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.3.1. Con: Parliament voted to trigger art 50 before the terms of a new deal were negotiated. Vote Leave was a campaign, not an elected political party, as everyone knew.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: It was not Vote Leaves fault that Article 50 was triggered before the promised trade deal was negotiated.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.3.1.2. Con: It does not matter who decided to trigger article 50 before a deal was in place, it was still not what the public voted for \(Brexit with a deal negotiated before leaving\).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.3.1.2.1. Con: How do you know what the public voted for? "Vote Leave" does not represent the public.  MPs do - it's their job, in fact, in a representative democracy.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.3.2. Pro: The full quote is "Taking back control is a careful change, not a sudden step – we will negotiate the terms of a new deal before we start any legal process to leave"
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.3.3. Con: The public at large did not confuse the Vote Leave campaign with an elected Government. Certain Remainers, it appears, are pretending to be confused to further their partisan political objectives.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.4. Con: This simply isn't true. The electorate clearly voted in the last election for the party whose mantra, as [enshrined in their manifesto](https://euobserver.com/uk-referendum/137962), was "No deal is better than a bad deal".
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.4.1. Con: [52 percent](https://www.bbc.com/news/election/2017/results) of voters chose parties who are [against](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-hard-leave-voters-labour-tory-mp-lies-boris-johnson-david-davis-jacob-rees-mogg-a8393841.html) a no-deal Brexit.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.4.1.1. Con: The above claim is simply untrue: Labour's stance on Brexit was deliberately obtuse and so it is untrue to say they were against a no-deal Brexit. Labour was both for and against every type of Brexit. Therefore only 12% of voters chose parties against, while 45.2% voted for parties who said 'no deal is better than a bad deal". They won four-to-one. Incredible.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.4.2. Con: The UK has a two party system, and [neither party](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/11/jeremy-corbyn-refuses-to-firm-up-labours-brexit-plans) said it would stop Brexit. Voting for conservatives or labour was not a Brexit/NoBrexit decision.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.4.2.1. Con: The UK had NoBrexit candidates from major political parties in every single electorate. The liberal democrats ran on a credible "Remainer" platform, and have subsequently become an irrelevancy. The SNP went backwards with its number of MPs too, while the Tories did far  better in Scotland than they have in a long time. The Tories made it clear that no deal was better than a bad deal, and that a good deal was a hard Brexit. And they won the election.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.4.2.1.1. Con: In a first-past-the-post parliamentary system less than 50% is a loss.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.4.2.1.1.1. Con: This is confusing the voting system itself with the results of the system.  It is hardly ever the case that the party which receives royal assent to form a government gets more than 50% of the vote. The Tories at the last election received a [historically high](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7529) proportion of the vote.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: And a minority of seats.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Still more seats than when they won power in [2010](http://www.ukpolitical.info/Historical.htm), and over [2 million more](https://www.bbc.com/news/election/2017/results) votes than they received when they won power in 2015.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.5. Con: WTO governed trade allows beneficial trade deals to be struck and therefore is what the electorate voted for.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.6. Con: WTO governed trade does not preclude a good trade deal with the EU, which definitely represents the desires of the majority.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3. Pro: The turnout for the Brexit Referendum was higher than that of any [general election](http://www.ukpolitical.info/Turnout45.htm) since 1997 \([at 72.2%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results)\)
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1. Con: Only 27% of UK residents [voted](https://www.indy100.com/article/brexit-leave-remain-52-48-per-cent-voter-turnout-electoral-register-charts-7399226) to leave while millions were [denied](https://www.indy100.com/article/heres-a-list-of-all-the-people-who-can-vote-in-the-eu-referendum-and-those-who-cant--x1ZGMHAFWW) a vote in the referendum.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.1. Con: Even though this is true, even fewer people voted to remain. In a binary vote, anyone who chooses to abstain from the vote submits themselves to the result. You absolutely cannot protest a vote of this nature by means of abstaining. There is no third option.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.2. Con: Even if those 16 or over could vote, an overwhelming majority would have to vote remain and not abstain in order to overrule leave votes. 16-17 year olds made up [Roughly 1,428,000](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/timeseries/jn5p/lms) of the voting population at the time. [89% of Scottish 16-17 year olds](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Votes-at-16-briefing.pdf) registered to vote in the Scottish referendum, and [84.6% of those actually voted](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/179807/Scottish-referendum-Public-Opinion-survey-ICM-Report-WEBSITE.pdf), which totals 75.3% of 16-17 year olds. Assuming similar proportions in the EU vote, only 1,075,198 votes would have been cast. This is not enough to change the outcome.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3. Pro: Many people were denied a vote in the referendum; this was profoundly undemocratic.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3.1. Con: Democracy does not mean that every man and his dog are eligible to vote. Rules and regulations on voting eligibility are necessary in a democracy to prevent abuse.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3.2. Pro: Approximately 1.5 million young people \(16-17\), who polled overwhelmingly in favour of staying in the EU, were [not allowed](http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/eu-referendum-uk-result-students-votes-at-16-remain-brexit-leave-a7101821.html) to vote.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3.2.1. Con: Under 18’s can also not vote in UK General Elections, Local Elections, or European elections so it is disingenuous to say they were ‘not allowed’ implying that this is exceptional.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.2.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3.3. Pro: More than 1 million Britons, who had been living in Europe for over 15 years, were [denied a vote](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/21/britons-abroad-denied-uk-general-election-vote-tories) in the referendum.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3.4. Pro: Approximately 1.5 million Europeans working in the UK were [denied a vote](https://www.indy100.com/article/heres-a-list-of-all-the-people-who-can-vote-in-the-eu-referendum-and-those-who-cant--x1ZGMHAFWW).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3.5. Pro: Nationals of most EU states, who pay tax and can vote in some other elections, were [not allowed](https://theconversation.com/who-can-vote-in-the-eu-referendum-57694) to vote in the EU referendum. They should have been allowed to vote.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3.5.1. Con: Paying taxes is not a prerequisite for voting eligibility. If it were then very poor people, for example, may be excluded. It is not unreasonable to limit voting on matters of state to people who have fealty to said state.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3.5.2. Con: Everyone who is eligible to vote in UK general elections was eligible to vote in the referendum.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3.5.3. Con: Britain is actually much more liberal on voting rights than many other countries, and so by international standards EU citizens should NOT have been allowed to vote. For example, only Irish citizens can vote in Irish referendums. Germany does not allow [any non-German EU citizens to vote](https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-ballot-box-closed-to-78-million-residents/a-40359141) in general elections, even if resident in Germany for decades.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3.5.4. Con: Every visitor to the UK who buys something pays tax in the form of VAT. Paying UK taxes does not entitle nationals of 3rd countries to vote.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3.5.5. Pro: [Excluding the estimated 700,000](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2017/02/09/brexit-referendum-human-rights/) British expats who have lived in the EU for 15 years or more \(arguably the group most affected by Brexit\) from voting is not rational or democratic.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3.5.5.1. Con: It is both rational \(they haven't pledged allegiance to the UK\) and democratic \(many countries limit voting to citizens\).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.4. Con: There was not a clear majority, only 51.89% voted Leave. There should have been at least 10% threshold to ensure a clear majority. Such a momentous change in national circumstance should not rest on such an insignificant majority.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5. Pro: The fact that Brexit negotiations have been so difficult has further [convinced](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/14/brexit-eu-referendum) many Leave voters that the EU is un-democratic and impinges on British sovereignty.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1. Pro: The EU is not democratic.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.1. Con: The UK had votes every couple years to elect representatives to the EU.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.2. Pro: Two of the three pillars of UK governance are unelected, i.e. 'The House of Lords' and ‘The Judiciary’.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.3. Pro: One of the most powerful EU bodies, the Commission, is [not democratically elected](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/matthew-ellery/eu-referendum_b_9514608.html).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.3.1. Pro: The European commission is unelected and have been active since 2007. We may elect our MEPs but the [main policy makers](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/c_2017_6915_final_en.pdf) are still unelected and while they are accountable to the European parliament who can censure their decisions it is by no means a perfect system as it falls to the foibles of international politics.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.3.1.1. Con: Commissioners are selected by democratically elected Governments. Having no faith in our Government choosing Commissioners to represent us within the EU suggests that we have no faith in them governing us with the full sovereignty Brexit will deliver.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.3.1.2. Con: The EU is no less democratic than the UK. The British cabinet ministers are unelected; they are selected by the PM.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.3.2. Con: The European Commission holds no actual legislative power, and serves a purely executive function, equivalent of that of the UK Civil Service, which is itself unelected.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.3.3. Con: One potential Commissioner is [nominated](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayFtu.html?ftuId=FTU_1.3.8.html) by the ruling \(democratically elected\) national government of each member state.  These suggestions are then confirmed by the democratically elected European Parliament.  So, the public vote for their own national government and, in doing so, place their trust in them to choose a suitable Commissioner, in an equivalent way to that which the UK public places their trust in their elected House of Commons to select a suitable Prime Minister.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.3.4. Con: The President of the Commission \(Jean-Claude Juncker\) was elected by the [Spitzenkandidat process](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/eu-affairs/20150526STO59409/spitzenkandidaten-the-story-of-what-made-last-year-s-ep-elections-different).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.4. Con: When passing laws the unelected bureaucrats of the EU work in a [co-decision process](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/13/is-the-eu-undemocratic-referendum-reality-check) with elected representatives of the European Parliament.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.10.1.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.6. Pro: The democratic deficit within the EU has left many feeling disenfranchised and led to the rise of [right wing parties.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/29/right-social-democracy-dying-europe-afd-far-right-germany)
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.6.1. Con: Growth of far-right politics is growing around the world, including in America and Australia. This rise has probably much more the effect of the Global Economic Crisis, where people around the world are dissatisfied with wage freezes, greater job insecurity and their politicians austerity policies reducing spending on infrastructure. [Rise of the American Far Right](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-far-right-revival-a-thirty-year-war)
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.6.2. Con: The rise of right wing parties doesn't make the EU undemocratic.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.7. Con: The European Commission is the civil service of the EU. It implements laws passed by the European Parliament. In this respect, the EU is as democratic as the UK. But, because the European Parliament is elected under Proportional Representation, the EU is in fact more democratic than the UK.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.8. Con: Democracy does not necessarily mean the same thing in the EU and the UK. The EU needs to strike a consensus between the different democracies of the Member States, some being coalition systems with multiple parties, some with first-past-the-post systems, etc. The EU cannot have the same type of democracy as a state, because it is a supranational organisation, working for the benefit of citizens and countries.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.9. Pro: European Parliament elections [suffer](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/05/europes-democratic-deficit-is-getting-worse/371297/) from low turnouts, and increasingly disengaged electorates.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.9.1. Con: This does not make the EU a non-democracy; the [United States](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/15/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/) suffers from similarly low voter turnouts.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.10. Pro: Even the EU [recognizes](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/democratic_deficit.html?locale=en) that many voters feel it suffers from a democratic deficit.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.10.1. Con: The fact that the EU publicly recognizes this is the mark of a responsive governance system.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.10.2. Con: The EU has acted to correct this. The democratic basis of the EU has been the European Parliament whose members have been elected by the electorate of the member states. While this is democratic, the electorate places more significance on their votes for their own national government than they do for their MEP, and are subsequently disenchanted that the European Parliament can overrule their national Government. Had the UK not chosen to pursue Brexit this discrepancy would have been [corrected](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/73195/1/blogs.lse.ac.uk-A%20vote%20to%20leave%20the%20EU%20may%20have%20a%20detrimental%20impact%20on%20Parliament.pdf).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.10.3. Con: The public opinion about the democratic deficit in the EU doesn't necessarily reflect reality.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.11. Con: The European Union Parliament is elected using [proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_to_the_European_Parliament), ensuring it is more democratic than the UK's own parliament.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.12. Con: Member states must have [strong democratic institutions](https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/policy/glossary/terms/accession-criteria_en) in order to join the EU.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.12.1. Con: There are four Nazis sitting on the European Parliament, three elected with the Greek [Golden Dawn](http://www.pappaspost.com/refer-greeces-golden-dawn-party-neo-nazi/), and one elected with the German [National Democratic Party](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-18/national-democratic-party-resembles-nazis-but-no-ban/8189930). Their wages are paid by the EU.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.12.1.1. Con: Allowing extreme parties is a characteristic of liberal democracy, not a lack of it. Golden dawn and NDP were elected with enough Greek/German votes to earn their position. Proportional representation requirements for MEP elections are designed to allow minorities a voice, no matter how unpleasant that voice may be. Until convicted of a crime, they have the right to become elected in a democracy, so they shouldn't be seen as a point against the EU's democratic institutions.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.12.1.1.1. Con: Allowing Nazis to be elected is a characteristic of a liberal democracy, but Nazis actually managing to get elected is testament of weak and corrupt democratic institutions.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.12.2. Pro: Following Turkey's dramatic shift toward illiberalism, European Commissioner Johannes Hahn [stated](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-eu/turkeys-eu-dream-is-over-for-now-top-official-says-idUSKBN17Y0U0) that its bid to join the EU was effectively finished.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.12.2.1. Con: This is no longer [the case.](https://www.ft.com/content/09935e16-a230-11e8-85da-eeb7a9ce36e4)
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.12.2.1.1. Pro: The article states that the EU might attempt to strengthen diplomatic relationships, but does not suggest that this comes anywhere close to the threshold required to join the EU.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.12.3. Con: Poland and Hungary have been making increasingly [illiberal and anti-democratic](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/02/05/hungary-and-poland-arent-democratic-theyre-authoritarian/) changes in their governance over recent years. It is unclear if the EU has the capacity to maintain democracy among its member states.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.12.4. Con: EU's accession criteria doesn't prove or refute the \(un\)democratic nature of the EU itself.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.13. Con: The EU's democratic legitimacy is also derived from participation of democratic national governments and leaders in the decision-making process. Some [EU decisions](http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-proposal-for-a-council-decision-establishing-provisional-measures-in-the-area-of-international-prote.html#/##vote_list_tabs_content_1) are taken on an international basis and excludes Parliament \(supranational legislature\) from the decision-making process.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.14. Pro: The EU is anti-democratic. It routinely attempts to enforce its will on member states regardless of democratic direction, as it did regarding Ireland's vote against the Lisbon Treaty. If Britain wishes to have political power, rights and freedoms, it must leave the EU. [The Guardian on the Lisbon Vote](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/13/eu-ireland-lisbon-treaty)
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.14.1. Pro: This has happened [three times](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2015/10/19/asking-the-public-twice-why-do-voters-change-their-minds-in-second-referendums-on-eu-treaties/) in EU referendums – in Denmark on the Maastricht Treaty in 1992-3, Ireland on the Nice Treaty in 2001-2, and Ireland again on the Lisbon Treaty in 2008-9.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.14.2. Con: For all three repeated EU referendum, the governments [sought reassurances](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2015/10/19/asking-the-public-twice-why-do-voters-change-their-minds-in-second-referendums-on-eu-treaties/) from the EU on the controversial themes of the first campaign. This allowed them to ask the same question again, but address the issues raised by the initial vote.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.14.2.1. Con: None of these countries' electorates had been asked their opinion again since they gave the 'right' answer, now that more is known about the implementation of the treaties. This shows a double standard and supports the claim that the EU is an undemocratic ratchet.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.14.3. Con: Scotland hasn't voted for a Conservative Government in decades and yet are generally controlled by Tories in Westminster. Being in a political union will inevitably involve compromises as well as benefits.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.14.4. Con: The situation in Ireland [changed](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/5638510/Why-Ireland-is-primed-to-reverse-its-Lisbon-Treaty-vote.html) after they voted against the Lisbon treaty so they put it to the vote again. It is a strange kind of democracy that cannot allow the electorate to change their mind.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.14.4.1. Con: It is a stranger kind of democracy when people are asked to vote again and again until they give the 'right' answer, at which point they are not asked to vote again.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.2. Con: Negotiations have been so difficult because the UK government did not plan enough time before triggering Article 50 to begin those negotiations.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.3. Con: Negotiations have [mainly](https://www.economist.com/bagehots-notebook/2018/10/01/the-tory-party-is-split-down-the-middle) been [between](https://www.politico.eu/article/steve-baker-brexit-chequers-theresa-may-tory-party-faces-catastrophic-brexit-split-says-former-minister/) [competing](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/conservative-party-split-theresa-may-chequers-brexit-steve-baker-conference-a8530126.html) factions of the Tory party, rather than with the EU.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.4. Con: The Brexit negotiations have been difficult due to lack of planning and incompetence of the Conservative government. The EU is just trying to protect the interests of its citizens.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.6. Pro: The will of the general public was to leave the EU, not leaving would irreparably damage the reputation of Britain on the world stage by making the country look weak and indecisive.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.6.1. Con: Brexit and the subsequent mess have already damaged the UK reputation. However, reputation is by far secondary to actual impacts, on trade, livelihoods, social progress and international cooperation. The capacity to work through a bad decision to a good one would only demonstrate how a mature democracy should actually work.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7. Con: Polls indicate that public opinion now supports remaining in the EU.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.1. Pro: A political group funded by George Soros that wants to overturn the referendum result [has alleged](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/11/more-than-100-pro-leave-constituencies-switch-to-remain) that there are more than 100 constituencies that voted for Brexit but now want to Remain.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.1.1. Con: Both of the groups that funded this study have been funded by [George](http://fortune.com/2018/05/30/george-soros-best-for-britain-brexit-campaign/) [Soros](https://www.civilliberty.org.uk/newsdetail.php?newsid=2345), who has [explicitly stated](https://www.politico.eu/article/second-brexit-referendum-george-soros-campaign-about-to-start/) his intention to reverse Brexit. The bias of the funding source together with clear methodological errors making the results a nonsense from a statistical standpoint and fuels suspicion that this is intentionally misleading propaganda.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.1.2. Con: This poll seeks to analyse all 600+ constituencies on the basis of a survey of just 15,000 people. This means an average sample size of just 25 people per constituency. The mean constituency size is [~70,000](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/elections-and-voting/constituencies/#jump-link-0), which means the margin of error for each constituency of [20%](http://www.comresglobal.com/our-work/margin-of-error-calculator/). Given the difference between Leave and Remain is far less than this in most constituencies, the headline result of this polling data of 100 constituencies switching is, statistically speaking, invalid.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2. Pro: Academics predict based on changing demographics that the majority of people will [want to remain](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-britain-eu-stay-2021-public-opinion-society-changes-theresa-may-transition-deal-a8278146.html) either now or within years, this is due to the increase in remain votes from young educated people entering the election roll, versus old and uneducated leaving \(death\).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.1. Con: The predictions of these academics will likely turn out to be false as according to notable international investors, experienced businessmen and politicians, people across all demographics [will increasingly realise from 2020 onwards](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2018/jul/24/two-50-or-100-years-when-do-leavers-think-brexit-will-pay-off) that they are better served by Britain not being a member of the EU.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.1.1. Con: According to one Brexit leader, the full benefits of leaving will take [at least 50](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2018/jul/24/two-50-or-100-years-when-do-leavers-think-brexit-will-pay-off) years to appear. The people living in the UK for the next 50 years will therefore not realise that leaving the EU is in their interests.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.2. Con: The predictions of these academics have not taken into account the probability that individual opinions on being part of the EU will change over time and as people become older, and therefore their predictions are interesting but extremely unreliable.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.2.1. Pro: As people age [they become more right wing](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/do-we-become-more-conservative-with-age-young-old-politics), and Conservative voters were [more likely](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/06/27/how-britain-voted/) to vote Leave than Labour voters. This was not taken into account by the academics' demography-based predictions.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.2.1.1. Con: A person's age is not the determining factor in deciding voting preferences; the [generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation#Western_world) one grew up is important as well.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.2.1.1.1. Con: The effect of aging on party affiliation as distinct from generational factors has been [known for some time](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/26/4/648/1868747?redirectedFrom=PDF).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: "It has not always been the case that younger generations are more Left-wing", according to a United States PEW Research [study](http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/30/a-different-look-at-generations-and-partisanship/) showing that whilst in 2014 age correlated with right-wing voting, the opposite was true in 1994.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: Studies suggest that the events that happen fairly early on in life set basic outlooks and orientations that affect how people vote for the rest of their lives. Examples from PEW, Bennington College, and Columbia University are discussed in [this article](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/09/the-politics-of-american-generations-how-age-affects-attitudes-and-voting-behavior/).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.2.1.1.4. Pro: The current older generation may vote conservative due to lower education levels, which will not be the case when current young generation becomes old. Younger generations are more likely to have been to university \([35% of 30-year-olds have a degree, compared with 10% of 70-year-olds](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/do-we-become-more-conservative-with-age-young-old-politics)\), and [higher education tends to make people more socially liberal](https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-do-we-become-more-conservative-with-age-47910). As the current young generation ages, they will therefore not be educationally equivalent/follow the same voting patterns as the current old.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.2.1.2. Pro: A long term study tracked voting choices of several thousand people over their lifetime, and found a [0.32% - 0.38%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379413000875) increase in Conservative voters per year.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.2.2. Pro: Older people [were more likely to vote for Brexit](https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/), and if it is true that people become more likely to support Brexit as they age then the academics' predictions will be inaccurate.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.2.3. Pro: The population is getting older because [we are living longer](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/bulletins/nationallifetablesunitedkingdom/2014to2016).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.2.4. Pro: Older voters are on average wiser than the youngest voters, and their views are less prone to fluctuation. As the youngest voters get wiser it is therefore reasonable to assume that a proportion of them will change their views to align more closely to the prevailing wisdom amongst older voters.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.2.4.1. Con: While life-experience increases with age, people's [IQ start decreasing by the age of 60](https://medium.com/psyc-406-2015/how-fast-does-iq-decline-can-you-do-anything-about-it-f5ca370d8b62), hampering good judgement and application of their knowledge.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.2.4.1.1. Con: The decrease in some measures of IQ happens after people tend to become fixed in their political opinions. Therefore the opinions of older generations are representative of the peak of their raw IQ-based capabilities.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.2.2.4.2. Pro: A university of Texas study found that [wisdom increases with age, especially for longer term strategic decisions](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/elder/8720182/Wisdom-comes-with-age-study-shows.html) which took future stages into account. They found that younger adults were better when only the immediate rewards needed to be considered. They suggested a biological cause of younger adults using their still strong ventral striatum, compared to older people who are forced to compensate by using their prefrontal cortices as their ventral striatum degrades.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.3. Con: Current polls show at most a few percent more votes for remaining in the EU. As Polls are not fully reliable especially by one or two percentage points, they currently only show that public opinion is still pretty evenly split.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.4. Con: [YouGov polling](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2018/03/29/where-britain-stands-brexit-one-year-out/) found that while slightly more people now think Brexit was the wrong decision, a majority of people still think they should continue with Brexit in some form \(a softer Brexit\), with only 13% saying Brexit should be abandoned completely.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.5. Pro: Combining all early 2018 polls gives an average \(once the Don’t Knows are left to one side\) of 48.5% for leave, and 51.5% for remain, according to [whatUKThinks.org](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/two-years-on-many-a-doubt-but-few-changed-minds/).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.7.6. Con: The majority of polls before the EU referendum also [suggested](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/eu-referendum-how-right-or-wrong-were-the-polls/) the UK would vote to stay in the EU. There is no evidence that the polling methodology is now more accurate on this question. Polls are therefore not a reliable indicator of voting behaviour on this issue.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.8. Con: If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy. \([Quote from speech](http://www.daviddavismp.com/david-davis-mp-delivers-speech-on-the-opportunities-for-a-referendum-on-europe/) by David Davis, now Secretary of State for Leaving the European Union.\)
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.8.1. Pro: It is not logical to stick to a decision without any reassessment of that decision if the situation changes. This is analogous to driving, where if you choose to turn right, then see a wall, but carry on going because the decision has been made. As negotiations have progressed, and the reality of the impact has begun to emerge, maybe we can now see the wall in front of us. This should at least mean that there is an opportunity to decide again.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.8.2. Con: While a democracy is free to change its mind, officials should not have referendum after referendum until they get the results that they want.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.8.2.1. Con: Results of referenda are not random. It is determined by the will of people. Therefore people can keep voting the same way unless something changed their mind.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.8.2.1.1. Pro: Public opinion has [remained split](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/opinion-polls/poll-of-polls/), within the margin of error of the previous result.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.8.3. Pro: The consensus at time of referendum was mildly in favour of Brexit. Current polling suggests the public are [mildly in favour of remaining.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum) Democratic will is based on a country's public's current preferences, not on their past preferences.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.8.3.1. Con: Polling at the time of the referendum suggested that too. It was wrong.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.9. Pro: When the British people decided by referendum on 23 June 2016 to leave the EU, the decision was not conditional on "hard" or "easy" Brexit.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.9.1. Con: The British people did not *decide* to leave the EU, they merely suggested it, in the certain knowledge that Parliament has a clear duty to consider all the relevant facts and then make the decision themselves...
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.10. Pro: The British people have been asked three times. Firstly, the Conservative Party manifesto promising a referendum on EU membership, secondly the referendum and finally the Conservative Party manifesto promising to uphold the result of the referendum.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.10.1. Con: The third resulted in a hung parliament.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11. Pro: Remaining in the EU would undermine the UK citizens' faith in democracy.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.1. Con: If a decision to remain in the EU was framed as an acknowledgment that the promises made by the leave side in the referendum campaign were entirely unachievable, and that therefore to remain is "the best possible deal", this could reinforce or strengthen democracy.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.3. Pro: The Remain voters tended to come from the "[elite classes](https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/)" with higher levels of education or held professional/managerial roles. Choosing to remain could be seen as the popular will being overcome by the wishes of the elite.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.3.1. Con: The key figures behind the Leave campaign \(politicans, donors and media owners\) are all very wealthy and could well be argued are part of the "elite".
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.3.1.1. Con: Members of the elite establishment were present on both sides of the debate. That does not change that fact that Remain voters were more likely to have [gone to university](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/30/facts-support-mps-claim-that-better-educated-voted-remain-pollster), and were [on average wealthier](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/brexit-voters-are-not-thick-not-racist-just-poor/).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.3.2. Con: Whilst yes the ABs \([The "Elite" classes](https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/)\) were the only social group to have a remain majority \(57%\), a much more decisive predictor of wishing to remain was age. 73% of 18-24s, 62% of 25-34s and 52% of 35-45s.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.3.3. Con: The pro-Brexit campaign was heavily support by wealthy individuals, largely being [funded](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-leave-eu-campaign-arron-banks-jeremy-hosking-five-uk-richest-businessmen-peter-hargreaves-a7699046.html) by five of the UK's wealthiest business men. Nigel Farage, perhaps the most prominent Leave voice, is [personally very wealthy](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/16/nigel-farage-skint-ukip-4m-townhouse).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.3.1.1.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.4. Pro: A majority of voters who did not vote in the 2015 election voted in the Brexit referendum. 60% of this group voted leave. A decision to not leave the European Union may disenfranchise these new voters \(Swales K., 2016, [pg. 19](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NatCen_Brexplanations-report-FINAL-WEB2.pdf)\)
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.4.1. Con: These people can vote for a Brexit party at the next election if they want. They are not disenfranchised.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.4.2. Con: That these people have never voted for or against a representative suggests perhaps that they do not understand the principles of representative democracy, in which case they clearly did not understand the nature of the referendum which was consultative, irrespective of what David Cameron \(UK Prime Minister during the referendum campaign\) might [claim](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-legally-binding-brexit-lisbon-cameron-sovereign-parliament).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.5. Con: Part of the argument for leaving is that Parliament should be sovereign. Parliament is a democratically elected body. If Parliament decides that hard Brexit is not in the best interests of the UK, then this would be a democratic action.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.6. Con: The referendum was [advisory only](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-vote-eu-referendum-not-legally-binding-supreme-court-legal-challenge-article-50-a7418706.html). It fundamentally undermines UK democracy to change the nature of the vote from advisory to binding after the results are in.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.6.1. Con: Parliament voted to implement the decision by triggering Art. 50 by an [overwhelming majority](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38833883).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.7. Con: Implementing a Brexit that does not meet the promises made by Leave politicians or fulfill the expections of Brexiteers will undermine the UK citizens faith in democracy.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.8. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.1.3.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.9. Con: Only a minority of those who were eligible to vote [voted](https://www.indy100.com/article/brexit-leave-remain-52-48-per-cent-voter-turnout-electoral-register-charts-7399226) to leave.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.9.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that those who did not vote would have voted in a different proportion to those who did vote.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.9.2. Con: A much smaller minority of those who were eligible to vote voted to stay.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.9.2.1. Con: A bit under two percent is not much smaller.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.9.2.1.1. Con: 1.3 million more people is much bigger.  This is about equivalent to the entire population of Estonia, and bigger than the entire populations of [3 other](http://www.worldometers.info/population/countries-in-the-eu-by-population/) EU states.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.9.3. Pro: The British 'public' did not vote Leave. The British 'public' far outnumber those in The electorate who voted Leave, but are still profoundly affected by the government's decision to do so. Leave only achieved 3.78% majority of the electorate, not the public.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.9.4. Con: This is juggling with numbers. The rules of the referendum were clear. With the amount of media attention the referendum got there was no way that anyone could not know about this event and its rules.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.10. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.11. Pro: Whatever the eventual consequences of a hard Brexit would be, preserving the basic social contract that gives legitimacy to a modern democracy is almost certainly more important.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.11.1. Con: The idea of a 'social contract' is \(mostly\) that citizens have surrendered decision-making power to the government, in [exchange for a protection of their rights and security.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract) Accepting the results of non-binding referenda \(with a very narrow majority\) as binding, without nuance, may undermine the objective of the social contract by not protecting the rights and security of a large portion of those citizens.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.12. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.13. Pro: Because of how [divided](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-36638528/brexit-just-how-divided-is-britain) the country is, reversing the referendum would require a level of nationwide consensus building that is unprecedented in modern history.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.13.1. Con: Unprecedented things can and do happen. That's where precedents come from.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.13.2. Con: Because every possible version of Brexit is opposed not just by remainers, but by [some factions of leavers](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/16039526.May_risks_inflaming_Tory_infighting_with_longer_Brexit_transition/) as well, following through on the referendum would require an even-greater level of consensus-building.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.14. Con: Referenda are [not legally binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendums_in_the_United_Kingdom) in the United Kingdom, as it is recognised that Parliament has sovereign authority.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.14.1. Pro: The EU referendum was not a General Election. There is no legal precedent on implementing the "democratic will" of the referendum before the Government defines the details of its interpretation of Brexit. A Government interpretation of what Brexit means is not the "will of the people".
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.14.2. Con: British constitutional law is not codified and operates partially through [conventions or customs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_convention_\(political_custom\)#United_Kingdom). Respecting the outcome of a referendum is an important convention, even if not codified.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.14.3. Pro: The referendum was legally advisory, and no supermajority was therefore required. It has only become politically binding during the referendum campaign, but this is not something that Parliament could vote for or against. If it was legally binding, Parliament might have [insisted on a supermajority](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201012/ldselect/ldconst/177/17706.htm).
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.15. Con: It is the primary job of any government to protect its citizens, even if that means sometimes doing things the public doesn’t like or doesn’t understand. If there are clear arguments against a hard Brexit then the UK should not leave the EU.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.15.1. Con: "Democracy is the worst system of government, except for all the others."  What you're espousing here is some sort of oligarchy. Britain, however, is a democracy.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.15.2. Con: You are saying on the one hand that the government should shirk the will of the people, then in the same breath saying that the people should rethink the whole process.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.15.2.1. Con: Unless Leave voters can decide on a definitive version of Brexit they can all stand behind, there is no real "will of the people". If our Government refuses to offer Britain a vote on the best deal it can negotiate on it's own interpretation of Brexit, when according to polls more people would now vote Remain, then doesn't qualify as democratic. [Statistics from 71 polls](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/if-there-was-a-referendum-on-britains-membership-of-the-eu-how-would-you-vote-2/)
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.16. Con: The Brexit Referendum did not generate consensus, with [Scotland and Northern Ireland](http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results) voting to remain.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.17. Con: The referendum was badly drafted, because it did not distinguish between vastly different versions of Brexit. [Leave voters themselves do not agree which version they want.](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/glo3xaqerh/InternalResults_170327_AnthonyBrexitQs_W.pdf) If and when the Government eventually decides what Brexit it wants, the majority of the public may be against it.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.17.1. Con: This point confuses the role of the referendum - to decide whether to leave the EU - and the role of government, which is to negotiate arrangements with 3rd parties on our behalf.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.17.1.1. Con: The decision to leave the EU can only be made properly when the alternative to the EU is clear. While they are two different processes, one may choose to leave the EU in the hope of a particular alternative, but the actual alternative offered in the end may be much worse, at which point the initial decision to leave the EU is not legitimate.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.17.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.17.2. Pro: "Referendums should be held when people know exactly what they are getting... We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards" David Davis \(now Secretary of State for Leaving the EU\) [said](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo021126/debtext/21126-17.htm) in 2002.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.17.3. Pro: Voting for Leave in the Brexit referendum, by a narrow margin of [51.89-48.11](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results), was not necessarily a vote for a hard Brexit.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.17.3.1. Pro: [Many people](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/03/29/attitudes-brexit-everything-we-know-so-far/) considered maintaining access to the single market an important priority in the negotiations.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.17.3.2. Pro: A roughly 50/50 split, as in this case, cannot be considered a consensus of the British people.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.17.3.3. Pro: We do not know the breakdown of issues that people voted Leave for, but it is clear that there were those who did so on the understanding that the UK would remain in the Single Market. If we leave the Single Market, the will of those particular Leave voters would be disrespected.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.17.4. Con: The exact outcome does not need to be clear for the result to have democratic legitimacy.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.17.4.1. Pro: Compared to a manifesto that voters use to determine which party they will vote for at a general election, the question and possible outcomes were narrower for this referendum.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.18. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.11.9.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.19. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.3.1.3.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5. Pro: Remaining in the EU would throw domestic British politics into chaos.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5.1. Con: Disarray in British politics isn't necessarily negative, as it may call into question the existing system and lead to calls for reform.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5.1.1. Pro: This reform could include rethinking the two \(three\) party system, and the need for proportionality voting. If Brexit does not work out, it may become clear that having two parties vying for votes by diametrically opposing each other does not lead to successful policies. It may indicate the need for broader electoral support, and coalitions between parties.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5.2. Con: The mere fact of the referendum has already thrown British politics into chaos, with political discourse dominated by Brexit when there are so many other important issues. Given the extremely narrow margin by which the referendum was won there will remain a large amount of political friction regardless of which route we take. Sadly that is inevitable, therefore it is not a reason to discourage any particular course.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5.3. Con: Leaving the EU is a project that is so all-encompassing, far reaching and consequential in so many areas of trade, jurisdiction and politics, that it will dominate the activities of the government and therefore British politics for years to come. Without the support of a big majority of the people and Parliament, and without a clear and similarly well-supported vision of the kind of country the UK will be after Brexit, Brexit is unsustainable in the long term, and even in the short term.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5.4. Pro: Deciding to remain in the EU grants UKIP a new and powerful antiestablishment narrative of betrayal.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5.4.1. Con: Nigel Farage [has already made comments contradicting himself on the economic benefits of Brexit.](https://twitter.com/open_britain/status/1002472366629322752) It will also be possible to present an equally powerful narrative of UKIP as being con-artists and betrayers.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5.4.2. Pro: UKIP is immensely culturally divisive. Past leaders such as Nigel Farage have made racist, sexist, and xenophobic [comments](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-resigns-ukip-leader-brexit-leave-most-controversial-moments-racism-sexism-immigration-a7118801.html). Current UKIP leader Henry Bolton has [stated](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/11/leadership-hopeful-warns-wrong-leader-could-turn-ukip-into-uks-nazi-party-henry-bolton) that under the wrong leadership, UKIP risks becoming the "UK Nazi Party."
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5.4.2.1. Pro: UKIP has close [ties](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/10/ukip-faces-questions-far-right-europe-for-freedom-and-democracy) to extreme far-right, anti-Islam parties in Europe, such as the Italian Lega Nord.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5.4.2.2. Pro: When addressing issues such as immigration, UKIP [chooses](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10782059/Nigel-Farage-takes-his-message-to-the-country.html) to frame the debate as a struggle between the "Westminster elite" and the rest of Britain, rather than engaging in substantive debate on whatever the issue is at hand. This makes productive discourse around such matters more difficult.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5.4.3. Pro: UKIP was accused of inciting racial [hatred](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants) with its controversial "breaking point" posters.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5.4.4. Pro: As they [considered](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/19/two-tory-mps-defect-ukip-wins-rochester-reckless) in 2014, the newly empowered UKIP will lure in many disaffected Tories, making it difficult to form a majority government.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5.4.5. Con: The UKIP vote has [collapsed](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-general-election-ukip-why-collapse-matters-conservative-majority-theresa-may/), and three leadership elections since the referendum have [strained](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/21/ukip-leader-henry-bolton-says-party-could-collapse-if-it-ousted-him) the party's budget.  It is unlikely the party in its current form can regain the type of power it held before 2016.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5.5. Pro: Immigration was less of an [issue](http://www.electionanalysis.uk/uk-election-analysis-2017/section-4-parties-and-the-campaign/why-immigration-faded-from-view-in-election-2017/) in election 2017 than it had been prior to the referendum. This was in part because many Leave supporters believed a Brexit deal would alleviate their concerns about immigration. Staying in the EU will rekindle the divisive politics of the referendum, as these betrayed voters would be drawn back to antiestablishment parties such as UKIP.
1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5.6. Con: Opinion polls indicate that the public regrets the Brexit vote. A [YouGov survey](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/13/labour-flags-up-brexit-poll-which-suggests-public-regret-decision), this past October, found that only 42% of respondents think it is right to leave the EU, compared with 47% who think it is wrong. This is a shift since the referendum.
1.3.2.2.4.1.13. Pro: If Britain wants to trade with the EU, it will still be forced to follow EU trade regulations, but without any input on what those regulations are.
1.3.2.2.4.1.13.1. Con: Only companies trading with EU will have to follow these regulations and only specific regulations will be applied. The UK is trading with the US but not all US regulations are part of the law in the UK.
1.3.2.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.3.1.
1.3.2.2.4.3. Con: David Cameron already tried proposing changes and [failed to extract meaningful concessio](https://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2017/02/camerons-renegotiation-took-place-a-year-ago-heres-our-take-on-it-from-the-time.html)ns.
1.3.2.2.4.3.1. Con: Mr Cameron secured the [“emergency brake/Red Card”](https://brexit853.wordpress.com/2016/09/27/powers-that-the-uk-has-failed-to-use-to-control-eu-freedom-of-movement-directive/) mechanism which allowed any EU country whose welfare system has come under strain, as the result of an influx of EU migrants of ‘an exceptional magnitude’, to restrict access to certain kinds of welfare benefits.
1.3.2.2.4.3.2. Con: It was recognised that the United Kingdom was [exempt](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35622105) to further political integration into the European Union.
1.3.2.3. Pro: In the UK, [32%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40192060) of MPs are women, whereas in the EU [37.4%](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/publications/2017/0001/P8_PUB%282017%290001_EN.pdf) of MEPs are women.
1.3.2.4. Pro: The UKs unadjusted Gender pay gap is [21%](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Gender_pay_gap_statistics).
1.3.2.4.1. Pro: The UKs Gender pay gap is the 4th largest in the EU, and is [higher than](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Gender_pay_gap_statistics) the EU member state average by 4.8%.
1.3.2.4.1.1. Con: Given that [there is no gender pay gap](https://www.kialo.com/should-the-uk-remain-in-the-eu-if-the-only-alternative-is-a-hard-brexit-8708/8708.0=8708.1-8708.1347-8708.1381+8708.1393-8708.1603), it is unclear what this metric means and whether it is positive or negative.
1.3.2.4.2. Con: There is no evidence this has anything to do with the EU bureaucracy per se.
1.3.2.4.3. Con: This is an [exceptionally crude measure](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37198653), skewed by the small proportion of men who earn extremely high salaries, particularly in finance jobs in London.
1.3.2.4.4. Con: It has been demonstrated that there is no significant gender pay gap. Rather, [proper analysis](https://www.henrikkleven.com/uploads/3/7/3/1/37310663/kleven-landais-sogaard_nber-w24219_jan2018.pdf) by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows that the wage gap is between mothers and fathers, and that it is due to the preference of mothers to focus on family.
1.3.2.4.5. Con: Much of the purported gender pay gap is actually [due to part time work being less well paid \(per hour\) than full time work](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37198653), and women being disproportionately more likely to do part time work.
1.3.2.4.6. Pro: It would be hypocritical to leave the EU citing sexism as a reason.
1.3.2.5. Pro: The EU commissions senior management is [35% female](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-4778_en.htm), and 37% of middle management is female.
1.3.2.5.1. Pro: The EU launched a new “[Diversity and Inclusion Charter](https://www.eubusiness.com/topics/employment/diversity-inclusion/)” in 2017 with promises of fresh action to reach at least 40 per cent women in its management by Nov 1, 2019.
1.3.2.5.2. Pro: This is [higher than](http://www.cityam.com/260427/number-uk-senior-business-roles-held-women-has-fallen-says) the UKs \(falling\) average of 19% in senior roles, and the global average of 25%.
1.3.2.5.2.1. Con: The UK’s civil service has [40% women](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/civil-service-gender-balance-2016) in the most senior roles and over 45% in the next most senior roles.
1.3.2.5.2.2. Con: Comparing the EU bureaucracy to private companies is inappropriate.
1.3.2.5.2.2.1. Pro: The EU bureaucracy passes and upholds laws on gender equality, and so should be expected to "practice what it preaches" and achieve higher gender equality than private companies do.
1.3.2.5.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.5.2.1.

1.3.2.5.5. Pro: This is higher than the worldwide average for parliaments \([22.8% as of June 2016](http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/leadership-and-political-participation/facts-and-figures)\).
1.3.2.5.6. Pro: This is higher than the Fortune 500 average of Female Senior managers \([20.5%](http://fortune.com/2017/06/09/white-men-senior-executives-fortune-500-companies-diversity-data/)\).

1.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.
1.3.7. Con: Men have been responsible for most social and technological advancement in the last 2000 years. There is no evidence supporting a claim that gender or racial diversity in political or social leadership has produced any measurable political or social improvements in the EU \(or anywhere\). Therefore, moving to actively include or exclude any group from leadership based on physical attributes rather than merit, may actually have no benefit to society, and could potentially damage it.
1.3.7.1. Con: This disparity in achievement can be explained by the relative [lack of opportunities](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2017/05/21/432758/womens-leadership-gap/) and resources for non-male persons.
1.3.8. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.
1.4. Con: Being part of the EU harms British culture.
1.4.1. Con: There is plenty of [evidence](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/al-archive/leap/uklife/britishculture/) that British culture \(however you define it\) is robust enough to withstand outside influence. There is no evidence that Germans are less German or French are less French because of the EU.
1.4.2. Con: British culture is itself an amalgamation of different cultures, including from many EU countries.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Being European is a big part of British culture. British art, food, sports and religions are primarily derived from thousands of years of shared history with other European countries and peoples.
1.4.2.2. Pro: British people and their culture are fundamentally European. The [Anglo-Saxons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons) and even the [Celts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts) arrived here from Europe. Before the Celts, Britain was [populated by Basques](https://thewildpeak.wordpress.com/2011/12/28/are-the-english-basque/) who arrived from France and Spain. Old English originates from North Sea Germanic, and [Modern English developed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_English) through combining Old English with Norse, French, Latin, and Greek.
1.4.2.3. Con: British identity, although having indeed been influenced by various cultures over the course of history, is still a unique country, with a specific culture and identity, that cannot be reduced to an amalgamation of different cultures \(which, in the end, could be considered true of all cultures\). After all, it is obvious from a glance, and even more if we dig deeper, that the UK is very different from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Hungary, etc.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: The UK is in fact a [collection](https://brilliantmaps.com/eng-gb-uk/) of countries \(and a country fragment\) each with its own distinct culture. They borrow from one other, and from their European neighbours.
1.4.2.3.2. Con: Italians are different from French \(remember Napoleon?\), Polish are different from Germans \(remember WW2?\). And yet, French, Italians, English, Polish and Germans share common values: human rights, no death row, freedom of speech, public services, democracy \(to mention a few\). The English are different, yes, but not more different than other European nations between them. And at the same time have much more in common compared to other cultures.
1.4.3. Pro: The EU has its own [anthem and flag](https://www.coe.int/en/web/tbilisi/the-coe/about-coe/flag-anthem), as symbols of a shared continental identity. These [cultural symbols](https://books.google.com/books?id=app9DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=council+of+europe+symbols+impact+on+culture&source=bl&ots=gRCvGO2kdo&sig=arEKdjK954syvTNPUUxw7eJlZd8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjtgPfXiYjZAhVDs1kKHaKFA4UQ6AEIUDAJ#v=onepage&q=council%20of%20europe%20symbols%20impact%20on%20culture&f=false) have the potential to distract from more local and national symbols of culture.
1.4.3.1. Con: The UK contains four national identities, each with their [own flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_flags), and even some counties within England, such as Lancashire, have their [own flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Lancashire). If someone can consider themselves to be from Lancashire, England, and the United Kingdom, it should not be difficult to also identify as European.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: It is not a question of difficulty, but of reality. 64% of British people felt they were British to the exclusion of being European \([Standard Eurobarometer 83, p.22](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/eb/eb83/eb83_citizen_en.pdf)\), and therefore feel that European identity and symbols do not represent them.
1.4.3.2. Con: The EU indeed has its own flag and anthem to create a shared feeling of being European. This was deliberate to end wars between European states. The EU has been mostly successful in this, but this doesn't override the national flags or anthems.
1.4.4. Con: EU programs are essential to [protecting culture heritage](https://ec.europa.eu/culture/policy/culture-policies/cultural-heritage_en), including archeological sites, monuments, museums, and artwork, that distinctively represent the culture within its member states. Brexit would mean that Britain would lose access to these programs which promote British culture.
1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.1.
1.4.4.2. Con: Protecting archeological sites is almost useless if the overall culture and identity of the country are being diluted.
1.4.4.3. Con: The money that the UK \([who contributes more than it receives](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8036802.stm)\) gives to the EU could be used directly in their own country. Leaving the EU would thus be more positive than negative.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: It has been argued that this case can easily be contradicted. Prof Iain Begg from LSE wrote in his article on the topic: "Often, however, an opposite case can be constructed just as convincingly by using a different mix of figures, leading to confusion about the true position." \([eprints.lse.ac.uk](https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/67030/1/Begg_EU%20budget.pdf) page 2\)
1.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: Figures are often used in the way that would suit the narration. For example, by using the theoretical contributions instead of the actual payments \(not including the UK's rebate\). In fact, calculations often omit certain indirect payments, or payments which do not go through the government. Prof Begg: "less readily measureable in UK budgetary accounts because a proportion of the receipts from EU programmes goes directly to recipients, rather than through UK public agencies." \([p10\)](https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/67030/1/Begg_EU%20budget.pdf)
1.4.4.3.2. Con: This claim also does not take into account those benefits the UK derives which cannot easily be measured in terms of money, i.e. the increased quality of goods consumed, the efficiencies for companies of having a wider workforce, the healthcare enjoyed by UK pensioners and others in other countries.
1.4.4.3.2.1. Pro: The EU could achieve higher efficiencies for the member states because it allows division of labour and higher specialisation \([see Adam Smith](http://www.victorianweb.org/economics/division.html)\). This is the ideal the EU \(ought to\) work towards.
1.4.5. Con: The UK has been part of the EU for over 40 years and still has a distinct culture. This suggests that EU membership is not a threat to British culture.
1.4.6. Con: The EU supports regional culture, and thus regional identity, more than the UK government does.
1.4.6.1. Pro: The European Capital of Culture Programme has supported regional culture [twice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Capital_of_Culture) in the UK, once in Glasgow and once in Liverpool.
1.4.6.2. Con: Between 2015-2016, the UK benefitted from [€11.3 million](http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/download-file/Arts_culture_Sector_exit_from_EU_NOV_16.pdf). In 2018, the total [Arts Council England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_Council_England) \(which distributes government arts funds\) budget is £622 million, with the amount spent outside London targeted to rise [from 70% to 75%](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/may/28/arts-council-england-increase-ratio-funding-outside-london-darren-henley). The EU's support for regional culture is minor compared to the UK's.
1.4.7. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.
1.4.8. Pro: EU freedom of movement inevitably leads to cultural diffusion as many British people move abroad and many Europeans with different cultural identities move to Britain. Many people in the UK feel this causes a rapid and uncontrollable change of their country's cultural identity.
1.4.8.1. Con: Cultural diffusion in itself is inevitable as countries continue to trade and globalize. Even before freedom of movement in the EU, Britain had massive exchanges of individuals and ideas from other cultures due to its universities, trade, and global conquest. Shifting the UK away from this history of globalization would in itself be a departure from British culture.
1.4.8.1.1. Con: Shifting the UK away from cultural diffusion would not be a departure from British culture. The British have their own unique culture. [Immigration](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-latest-news-leave-eu-immigration-main-reason-european-union-survey-a7811651.html) threatens that and is the number one reason the UK voted for Brexit in the first place.
1.4.8.2. Con: This begs the question of whether or not cultural diffusion is undesirable, or inevitable. London is the most culturally diverse city in Europe. Over [300 languages](http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/definitions.shtml) are spoken there. Arguably this has led not to diffusion, but the opportunity to  understand and embrace cultural diversity.
1.4.8.2.1. Con: It is undesirable when it prevents assimilation into the local or national culture \(thus various cultures simply pile onto each other\), and even damages it \(leading for example to the idea that there is NO national culture\). Culture is beautiful when it is homogenous — any culture muddled with others simply becomes something else, the original culture disappearing.
1.4.8.2.2. Con: Cultural diversity is not best enjoyed by cultures invading your own \(settling in, with very little to no assimilation\), but by travelling, thus in fact witnessing really different cultures preserved in their own land with their own people. For example, to witness Indian culture, you would go to India, not London. Same thing for any other culture \(Chinese, French, Ethiopian, German, Nigerian, etc.\).
1.4.8.3. Con: British ex-pats tend to become more engaged with British culture, as indeed ex-pats in general do. The effect is balanced out between incoming migrants who preserve their originating culture and outgoing migrants who preserve and spread British culture.
1.4.9. Pro: The introduction of new, often short-term, communities of EU workers within Britain weakens cohesion in already established communities by provoking resentment from those who experience economic harms like job loss as a result.
1.4.9.1. Con: On average, areas in which immigration is lower had a [higher share](https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-how-areas-with-low-immigration-voted-mainly-for-brexit-62138) of the vote for Brexit. Those who are impacted by the arrival of EU migrants did not seem to weigh this effect that highly.
1.4.9.2. Pro: Although it is generally small, there is a specific downward effect on the [wages of unskilled native workers](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2015/the-impact-of-immigration-on-occupational-wages-evidence-from-britain). As they are a vulnerable group, their economic welfare ought to be prioritised.
1.4.9.2.1. Con: The impact of migration on the wages of the UK-born in the semi-skilled and unskilled sector since 2004 has been about [1 percent](https://www.ft.com/content/0deacb52-178b-11e6-9d98-00386a18e39d), over a period of eight years. This is not only an insignificantly small decrease over a large period of time, it is certainly not something worth trading off the benefits of migration for.
1.4.10. Con: Culture is organic and evolves constantly, with each generation adding or removing customs and practices. Leaving the EU will do nothing to change this, as migration will still be allowed in both directions, even if in reduced quantities. This means the British population will still be exposed to different cultures, customs and practices which each individual is allowed to choose to adopt or not \(if the law permits\).
1.4.10.1. Con: Culture is indeed organic, however it needs time to assimilate various influences, to make it its own. The lack of border control weakens the ability to control the rate at which people come into the country, which in turn makes it harder to both assimilate immigrants and to integrate eventual cultural influences from them into \(and not on top of\) British culture.
1.4.11. Con: Throughout England and Wales, relatively high immigration areas have voted [overwhelmingly](https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-how-areas-with-low-immigration-voted-mainly-for-brexit-62138) to remain in the EU, whereas the relatively low immigration areas tended to vote leave.
1.4.11.1. Con: If you look at changes in immigration levels a [different pattern](https://www.economist.com/britain/2016/07/14/explaining-the-brexit-vote) emerges. Recent changes in the proportion of immigrants \(even though to smaller absolute numbers\) correlated strongly with voting leave.
1.4.11.1.1. Pro: This shift may mean that the areas that voted leave were less equiped to adjust to immigration, thus they were acting off real experience.
1.4.11.1.2. Con: This does not necessarily disprove the parents claim that "perception of migrants has more effect than experience", instead it shows that people do not like change.
1.4.11.1.2.1. Pro: It could be suggested that if the rate of migration in a town like Boston slowed drastically, the town would get used to the new migrants and opinions would move towards that of the other high total immigration areas \(leaning towards remain\).
1.4.11.2. Pro: From this it appears that any negative consequences for culture and national unity are not so much experienced by people who have the most experience with immigrants, but could be just a perception of those without much experience with immigrants.
1.4.11.3. Con: Most [migrants](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2016/06/24/eu-referendum-how-the-results-compare-to-the-uks-educated-old-an/) and [BME voters](https://quarterly.demos.co.uk/article/issue-7/conservative-breakthrough/) voted for remain — the obvious consequence is that, in high immigration areas, the remain vote was stronger. It has nothing to do with experience of immigration/immigrants. This argument would only be relevant and true if migrants from the last 50 years had not voted.
1.4.11.3.1. Con: Citizens from other European countries \(apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus\) [did not get to vote](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/649517/EU-referendum-2016-Voting-Voters-Allowed-British-Irish-Commonwealth-Citizens-European) in the Brexit Referendum.
1.4.11.3.1.1. Pro: Most EU migrants in the UK do not apply for citizenship.
1.4.11.3.1.1.1. Pro: In 2016 [30,000](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/sharp-rise-in-number-of-eu-nationals-applying-for-uk-citizenship) EU nationals applied for citizenship, out of approximately [117,000](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40043483). This is around a quarter.
1.4.11.4. Con: Even if this were true, it would not be surprising that people who have not yet been negatively affected by immigration would be apprehensive of those effects reaching them — as them not living in high immigration areas does not mean they cannot know how immigration affects their country.
1.4.12. Con: A major proportion of immigrants in the UK are not from the EU, but rather [countries somehow tied in with the British Empire](http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/migrants-in-the-uk-an-overview/) such as Pakistan, India, South Africa, Bangladesh, Nigeria. Culturally, they are more difficult to integrate than fellow Europeans. The control of borders for the former has been resting with British authorities and is not an EU issue.
1.4.12.1. Con: There has been a great [increase of immigration from Europe](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/22/eu-referendum-the-europe-debate-in-numbers/) in the last five to ten years, wether it be [Western, or Eastern Europe](https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/statistics-net-migration-statistics/#create-graph) \(in particular Bulgaria and Romania\). More accurately, immigration is on a downward trend from non-European countries, whereas immigration from EU-coutries has greatly increased. Furthermore, there being strong non-EU immigration doesn’t mean EU-immigration cannot be a problem. Those are two different issues, and should be handled differently.
1.4.12.2. Con: A lot of the immigration people were concerned about was illegal immigration, with the current migrant crisis, as the EU has been very lax in controlling its own borders. In this case, once migrants get into the EU, they can pretty much travel anywhere in it without much problems.
1.4.13. Con: Being part of the EU breaks down reliance on British culture. Culture isn't the latest version of correct. It's your great great… great grandfather's idea of correct. As such it's not necessarily correct today. Relying on it would thus be bad and exposure to other cultures causes us to take a more critical eye to our own.
1.4.13.1. Con: British culture is at least partly that of freedom, democracy, and the enlightenment. Not exactly a bad cultural heritage.
1.4.13.2. Con: A Nation is its culture. Without "British culture", there is no "Great Britain." It would either be a mishmash of other cultures with no real identity, or simply become another country altogether.
1.4.13.2.1. Con: It is deeply troubling that some people feel that British culture is so fragile that they need to isolate it from outside influences. Presumably such people are careful to not allow any American television shows to enter their homes, don't eat Chinese, Indian, Italian, or Mexican food. Even fish and chips, the mainstay of British takeaway cuisine originated in Belgium.
1.4.13.2.2. Pro: A difference needs to be established, of course, between outside influences in a normal fashion \(cultural exchanges, some immigration, etc.\) and in the current situation \(mass migration, intense cultural influences through this migration as well as TV, the Internet, etc.\). Even more so in a country that is presented as having no specific culture, which, if believed, makes it even weaker — the UK being particularly afflicted by this through the notions of multiculturalism and communitarianism.
1.4.13.3. Con: Other cultures can be just as bad \(human sacrifices, honour killings, the position of women and minorities, castes, etc.\). Not to say they’re all or essentially bad and can’t bring anything good, but to say British culture should just be replaced by others is ignorant and selfish.
1.4.13.4. Con: The majority of British culture is about being open, and diverse, taking in, and absorbing a multitude of other cultures, as we have done for centuries, it is the only thing that makes us what we are. The EU has not broken that down, it adds to it.
1.4.14. Con: The greatest changes to British culture in recent decades have been overwhelmingly influenced by American TV, film, social media and music. Even British-made media is now made to be "sellable" to America. Language barriers make influence from European cultures slow to cross over and even slower to spread, but Americanisation permeates every level of British life. It's ironic that many Leave voters support further integration with the USA while simultaneously fearing cultural erosion via the EU.
1.4.14.1. Con: One problem does not negate another, and one could say that at least it’s anglo-saxon culture. The fact is the problem of American influence is a different problem to that of European influence \(especially this notion that the UK doesn’t really have its own culture, and is at best just an amalgam of other cultures — European and otherwise\).
1.4.14.1.1. Con: The Angles, Saxons and Jutes all came from mainland Europe, or from north Germany, Denmark and northern Holland to be more precise. America is itself a huge blend of cultures including German, Italian, Chinese, etc. so suggesting that they are culturally far closer to us is misleading.
1.4.15. Pro: The EU encourages large movements of populations. While immigration is not a problem in itself, if it is too large, and too fast, the people coming in [cannot be assimilated](http://www.france24.com/fr/20150501-birmingham-limites-multiculturalisme-anglais-royaume-uni-elections-islam-tensions-communautarisme-small-heath) to the country’s culture. Thus communities form, that live apart from British culture and do not assimilate or identify with it. It harms British culture, and weakens social cohesion indeed.
1.4.15.1. Con: The way UK immigration figures are calculated means that the numbers include a great many people who have no intention of becoming permanent residents of the UK. Students, seasonal workers, etc. form a large part of the "immigrant" population and they all tend to return to their home countries after a short stay. There's no need for such people to be assimilated, and no evidence that their clustering for mutual support while resident here inflicts any damage on British culture.
1.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.
1.6. Pro: A hard Brexit may significantly damage the UK economy.
1.6.1. Pro: Britain may have to pay a Brexit divorce bill.
1.6.1.1. Pro: The UK's [Office for Budget Responsibility \(OBR\) suggests](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/689581/CCS207_CCS0318157642-1_OBR_EFO_March_2018_Accessible.pdf#page=23) that Britian will be [paying the divorce bill until 2064](https://fullfact.org/europe/brexit-divorce-bill-2064/), with the majority paid by 2021, and the total net estimate at £37.1 billion. \(March 2018\)
1.6.1.2. Con: In the event of a no deal brexit, there will be [no divorce bill](http://uk.businessinsider.com/government-not-obliged-to-pay-52-billion-brexit-divorce-bill-2017-3) for the UK to pay, as the [agreement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/joint-report-on-progress-during-phase-1-of-negotiations-under-article-50-teu-on-the-uks-orderly-withdrawal-from-the-eu&ved=2ahUKEwiDt-Wv8-rbAhUrBsAKHcamDHAQFjAFegQIAhAB&usg=AOvVaw2lySUz0sIGRclxf59BZreS) reached thus far has been "under the caveat that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed."
1.6.1.3. Pro: In December 2017, the British prime minister [put forward £39 billion](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-divorce-bill-financial-settlement-39-billion-theresa-may-juncker-agreement-northern-ireland-a8099076.html), though recent [auditors say](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-divorce-bill-brexit-theresa-may-estimate-eu-exchange-rate-pac-a8312776.html) "relatively small changes” to government assumptions – on economic performance, ongoing payments into EU schemes or the exchange rate – would throw out the calculation.
1.6.1.4. Con: The [British prime minister said](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2017-12-11/debates/965E3010-41F6-4353-A2CC-2F5A6C31495F/BrexitNegotiations) "We will continue to pay our net contributions under the current EU budget plan" but added that that was "conditional upon a number of principles we have negotiated over how we will ultimately arrive at a fair valuation of these commitments" \(December 2017\).
1.6.1.5. Pro: Article 70 of the [Vienna Treaty](https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%201155/volume-1155-i-18232-english.pdf) says a party leaving a treaty has an obligation to existing agreements made before leaving.
1.6.1.5.1. Pro: The [Vienna Treaty text says](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/125/12511.htm)  "termination of a treaty" "does not affect any right, obligation or legal situation of the parties created through the execution of the treaty prior to its termination.”
1.6.1.5.1.1. Pro: If the Vienna Treaty Applies, Brexit is bound by international treaty to pay it's Divorce Bill.
1.6.1.5.2. Pro: A House of Lords report decided "the meaning of Article 50 TEU, should, as a matter of EU law, be determined in the light of rules laid down in the Vienna Convention"
- ["Brexit and the EU budget" March 2017](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/125/12511.htm).
1.6.1.5.3. Con: A House of Lords report "concludes that Article 50 TEU is 'lex specialis', or an exception, expressly mentioned in the first part of Article 70 VCLT. In other words, because the TEU contains a specific provision on withdrawal, Article 70 is irrelevant to the UK’s financial obligations arising out of its EU membership." 
- ["Brexit and the EU budget" March 2017](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/125/12507.htm#_idTextAnchor040).
1.6.1.5.3.1. Con: [Independent legal analysis has suggested](https://www.ejiltalk.org/the-brexit-bill-and-the-law-of-treaties/) this is incorrect. Article 50 TEU only specifies a specific procedure \(the timeline and notification requirements\), and does not explicitly specify anything about existing obligations, and so does nothing to overrule the specified existing obligations under Article 70 VCLT.
1.6.1.5.4. Con: Those agreements were made with two major caveats. Firstly, the possibility of leaving the EU with a two year notice period. Second, the expectation of continuing benefits. Art 70 of the Vienna Treaty is therefore \(arguably\) satisfied without any payment after March 2019 in the event of no deal.
1.6.2. Pro: The end of the free movement of people will reduce the supply of labour, damaging the British economy.
1.6.2.1. Con: Reducing immigration is a political choice that is not necessitated by a hard Brexit.
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: The UK controlling their own immigration policy doesn't necessarily mean it will limit immigration. Perhaps the UK will set such immigration policies as to avoid costs of low immigration or to obtain a free trade agreement with India or Australia.
1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Much of the initial impetus of Brexit was around immigration being too high, impacting housing and infrastructure like schools and the NHS. Suggesting that we could have the same or more immigration as a result of Brexit damages the whole "will of the people" argument.
1.6.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.2.
1.6.2.1.3. Con: Consistent [polling](http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-31/immigration/introduction.aspx) has shown that a sizable majority believe the UK's immigration levels are too high.
1.6.2.1.3.1. Pro: The BSA poll is well respected and has been [running since 1983](http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/about/about.aspx).
1.6.2.1.3.2. Con: Polling the electorate on their beliefs about the levels of immigration is not a valid method of establishing the correct levels or possible effects of immigration, because individual perceptions can be influenced by the media and scaremongering.
1.6.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: Actually, it's true that British people feel they're hosting [more immigrants than those who they really host](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/oct/29/todays-key-fact-you-are-probably-wrong-about-almost-everything).
1.6.2.1.3.2.2. Con: It should be noted however, that the opinions of those that compete for services with migrants are the ones whose lives are most affected by immigration. We should be careful not to neglect the feelings of some people based, for example, on your opinion of the newspaper they read.
1.6.2.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Societal fears should not be a factor in policy making. Misperceptions should be mitigated through correct, responsible information to those sectors of the society by the institutions.
1.6.2.1.3.3. Con: Public perception and concern over immigration levels have little resemblance to the actual levels of immigration.[LSE Blog - Perceptions and Reality](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/perceptions-and-reality-ten-things-we-should-know-about-attitudes-to-immigration-in-the-uk/)
1.6.2.1.3.4. Con: Polls with public results alter perceptions and public opinion by making the majority opinion observable to people who may be influenced when reacting to that same issue.
1.6.2.1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.10.2.1.9.
1.6.2.1.4. Pro: This would allow the UK to implement a [merit-based](http://www.euronews.com/2017/09/06/watch-live-pm-theresa-may-faces-mps-questions-for-first-time-since-summer-break) immigration policy which, due to strict policing and mandatory quotas, would be impossible under EU regulations.
1.6.2.1.4.1. Con: Successive UK Governments have not applied all the measures that are available to police immigration from either without or within the EU.  Under resourced Customs and Immigration departments UK wide are the [problem](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/18/border-force-funding-cut-by-quarter-per-person-arriving-to-uk/), not EU membership as such.
1.6.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: Immigration departments in Britain do not have any figures as to how many legal EU and non-EU migrants are currently living in Britain [Link](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/845163/Immigration-figures-wrong-again-Home-Office-scramble-to-get-numbers-right). The Windrush scandal happened because of poor immigration records and Theresa May's "Hostile Environment" policies.
1.6.2.1.5. Pro: The point of Brexit is that it will be up to the people, as represented through their MPs, who will decide what sort of immigration system they want; together with the freedom to change it whenever they want into the future.
1.6.2.1.5.1. Con: The UK Government has chosen to implement its own interpretation of Brexit. There has been no consultation with the British electorate to debate what kind of immigration system the public wants or what socio-economic costs there would be for doing so.
1.6.2.1.5.1.1. Con: The Government sought a mandate from the electorate based on its manifesto at the last general election, and received it.
1.6.2.1.5.1.1.1. Con: Theresa May insisted that a vote for the Conservatives was a vote for confidence in her delivering Brexit. She lost numerous seats in the last General Election.
1.6.2.2. Pro: Skilled foreign workers actually [grow](http://uk.businessinsider.com/immigrants-create-jobs-for-local-workers-2015-6) British businesses, making them more profitable and leading to further job creation.
1.6.2.3. Pro: [Leaving the EU means we could lose over 4,500 NHS nurses](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/nhs-brexit-crisis-could-see-12925831), among many other skilled workers that come from the EU.
1.6.2.4. Pro: Migrants make a positive net contribution to the economy.
1.6.2.4.1. Pro: Data analysis of 30 years of data from 15 countries in Western Europe shows that [migrants positively affect the economy within a year of arrival](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/6/eaaq0883), continuing to have significant impact for 2+ years.
1.6.2.4.2. Pro: In America, immigrants are [net fiscal contributors](http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=23550) on the federal level.
1.6.2.4.3. Pro: Researchers generally agree that immigrants from the European Economic Area \(EEA\) and recent immigrants are, as groups, [more likely to have a positive net fiscal impact](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-immigrants-affect-public-finances/).
1.6.2.4.3.1. Pro: A [2014 UCL study](http://www.cream-migration.org/files/FiscalEJ.pdf) estimated that during the years 1995-2011 the total fiscal impact of EEA migrants in the UK was about +£0.3 billion per year, but the total fiscal impact of non-EEA migrants for this period was estimated at -£6.9 billion per year. The UK-born population impact was -£34.8 billion per year.
1.6.2.4.4. Con: A [report](https://www.ippr.org/files/images/media/files/publication/2011/05/Paying%20Their%20Way_1352.pdf?noredirect=1) from the Institute for Public Policy Research \(IPPR\) in 2005 found that expenditure attributed to immigrants grew by more than the revenue from them, resulting in a negative impact of -£0.4 billion in 2003-4.
1.6.2.4.4.1. Con: During this time period the report found that the UK born population also had a negative fiscal impact, and their [impact was higher](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-immigrants-affect-public-finances/) than the immigrant impact.
1.6.2.4.5. Con: [MigrationWatch UK studies](https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/briefing-paper/7) show that depending on how you account for dependent children or the elderly, migrants give a negative net contribution.
1.6.2.4.5.1. Pro: If costs from children born to one immigrant and one UK-born parent are [shared between both categories](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-immigrants-affect-public-finances/), MigrationWatch estimates show that the net fiscal impact of immigrants was negative \(-£1 billion for 1999-2000 and -£5 billion for 2003-2004\).
1.6.2.4.5.1.1. Con: These UK born children should count as fully UK born, not half immigrant, because they are UK citizens.
1.6.2.4.5.1.2. Pro: Alternative estimates allocating all children of mixed couples to the immigrant group show the fiscal cost of migrants to be [much higher](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-immigrants-affect-public-finances/) \(around -£3.8 billion in 1999-2000\).
1.6.2.4.5.2. Pro: A Migration Watch UK [paper](https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/briefing-paper/381) looking at the 2014/15 period found that if you look at the Working Age population only, the UK-born population was the only group that \(out of EEA, Non-EEA, UK Born\) [did make a positive fiscal contribution](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-immigrants-affect-public-finances/).
1.6.2.4.5.2.1. Con: It is fairer to look at the whole age range than a narrow one, as increases in dependents/the elderly has a significant effect, and all effects of migration should be considered.
1.6.2.4.6. Pro: HMRC released a [report](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/tax-contribution-of-recently-arrived-eea-nationals-for-2013-to-2014) in May 2016, which said that recently arrived EEA nationals –those who arrived within the previous 4 years – received £0.56 billion in tax credits and Child Benefit in the 2013/14 fiscal year but paid £3.11 billion in income taxes and national insurance contributions.
1.6.2.4.6.1. Con: This report ignored taxes like VAT and Council Tax, benefits like Housing Benefit and JSA, and use of a range of public services, and so is not a good indicator of financial cost/benefit.
1.6.2.4.7. Pro: In 2013 the Office for Budget Responsibility \(OBR\) predicted that in the long term \(50 years\) [higher net immigration would reduce pressure on government debt](http://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/2013-FSR_OBR_web.pdf).
1.6.2.4.8. Pro: The [OECD found that](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/international-migration-outlook-2013_migr_outlook-2013-en) migration in the UK contributed +0.46% of GDP.
1.6.2.4.8.1. Con: The same report found that Germany had negative fiscal impact from migration, at -1% of GDP, showing that depending on the demographics migrating, migration can be bad financially.
1.6.2.4.8.2. Pro: The UK benefits more than average from migration, receiving +0.11% higher GDP due to migration than the average \(+0.35% of GDP\).
1.6.2.5. Con: The UK is one of the [least mechanised](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2018/08/britains-economy-is-not-suffering-as-much-as-the-doom-mongers-insist/) country in the developed world due to the low cost of immigrant labour. This depresses wages and harms manufacturing output. Lack of immigrant labour would lead to increased mechanisation and the funding of training for employees who would in turn earn more money - thus helping with the gap in wages and cost of living.
1.6.2.6. Pro: [EU migrants](http://bruegel.org/2016/06/what-is-the-age-profile-of-uk-immigrants/) are younger and more likely to be in work compared to the average member of the population, and so pay more tax and rely on state services less.
1.6.2.7. Pro: UK unemployment is at an [all time low](http://uk.businessinsider.com/uk-unemployment-rate-productivity-wages-2017-2018-1), meaning the country is almost at [full employment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fullemployment.asp), and therefore the economy will suffer if the labour pool is reduced.
1.6.2.8. Pro: In low-skilled sectors \(e.g. hospitality, food processing and construction\) employers have difficulty finding British employees and rely on predominantly Eastern European migrant labour \([Rolfe, p.51](https://www.niesr.ac.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Free%20movement%20-%20Final%20report.pdf)\).
1.6.2.9. Con: -> See 1.4.9.2.
1.6.3. Pro: Businesses could lose their [passporting](https://www.independent.ie/business/brexit/brexit-means-brexit-everywhere-uk-banks-will-lose-eu-passporting-rights-barnier-36336220.html) rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each individual country.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Over [5,400](https://www.independent.ie/business/brexit/brexit-means-brexit-everywhere-uk-banks-will-lose-eu-passporting-rights-barnier-36336220.html) British firms rely on passporting rights to bring in £9 billion in revenue every year to Britain.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Loss of passporting rights would mean the [immediate end](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-talks-collapse-negotiations-eu-uk-theresa-may-david-davis-no-deal-wto-a7955471.html) to any business UK banks had in the EU.
1.6.3.2.1. Con: Losing passporting rights only [involves a restructuring of operations](http://www.cityam.com/249639/moodys-says-uk-banks-dont-need-eu-passporting-rights) in order to continue offering financial services in Europe.
1.6.3.2.2. Con: Zurich, Switzerland, is the [second most competitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Financial_Centres_Index) banking centre in Europe after London despite not having passporting rights.
1.6.3.2.2.1. Con: Switzerland benefits from a more open [freedom of movement agreement](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/839032/brexit-news-latest-switzerland-germany-economy-finance-banking-european-union) with the EU than the UK will have after Brexit.
1.6.3.2.2.2. Con: Switzerland has made many [ethical trade offs](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/05/tax-gap-avoidance-switzerland) to ensure their competitive edge in the banking sector.
1.6.3.2.3. Pro: As a result, since the Brexit vote, many banks and financial firms have begun establishing EU bases to take their operations [out](http://www.theweek.co.uk/brexit/81116/brexit-and-the-british-economy) of the UK.
1.6.3.3. Pro: Services includes much of the UK's computing industry, such as apps sold online.
1.6.4. Pro: Trade deals take time to negotiate. So for a period of some years the UK will not have negotiated trade deals which will impact the economy. At which point with the UK desperate for trade deals in the beginning to limit the impact of WTO tariffs, it will be likely the UK will be negotiating from a position of weakness and will negotiate one sided deals detrimental to the UK.
1.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.6.
1.6.5. Pro: Britain will default to trading under the worst possible terms with the EU in the immediate aftermath of Brexit.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Britain could become a 'third country', meaning trading with the world under the worst possible tariff rules. Even after a period spent establishing its position [under WTO rules](http://ukandeu.ac.uk/explainers/no-deal-the-wto-option/), the UK will almost certainly still suffer.
1.6.6. Pro: Since the announcement of Brexit the value of the pound has [dropped](https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/bank-of-england-spot/historical-spot-exchange-rates/gbp/GBP-to-EUR#charts).
1.6.6.1. Con: The weaker pound will make British exports more competitive.
1.6.6.1.1. Con: However, with hard Brexit there will be a lack of involvement in the free market. This would mean decreased exports to EU countries due to less benefits and thus increased costs.
1.6.6.1.1.1. Pro: With no new trade agreement with the EU, the rules of the World Trade Organisation would apply. Tariffs would be imposed on goods that the UK sends to the EU, which would negatively affect many British companies who rely on this trade.
1.6.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: British farmers would face [30-40](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-talks-collapse-negotiations-eu-uk-theresa-may-david-davis-no-deal-wto-a7955471.html) per cent charges for exporting to the EU. This would be a huge blow to agriculture in Britain.
1.6.6.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Part of the reason UK farmers are so reliant on EU markets is because the [protectionist](https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/protectionism-tariffs-us-european-union-913499) [nature](https://brexitcentral.com/remainer-lord-hannay-wrong-eu-tariffs-african-imports/) of the [EU bloc](https://iea.org.uk/the-eus-thousands-of-senseless-tariffs-punish-the-poor/) means that reciprocal tariffs or strict quotas are in place with many other countries.
1.6.6.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Mark Manger and Atom Vayalinkal \(of the London School of Economics\), who have compared tariff data for Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, the UK and the US, [reach a different conclusion](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/10/24/the-eu-isnt-protectionist-its-one-of-the-most-open-economies-in-the-world/). On manufactured goods the EU has the second-lowest tariffs after Japan. On agricultural products Japan has the highest tariffs, followed by the US.
1.6.6.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Looking at average tariffs as Manger and Vayalinkal have done can disguise the true picture, as tariffs are only one of the ways in which protectionist entities like the EU and US restrict trade, and specific tariffs still cause harm, as explained by [Rolf Langhammer](https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/protectionism-tariffs-us-european-union-913499) and [Kevin Dowd](https://iea.org.uk/the-eus-thousands-of-senseless-tariffs-punish-the-poor/).
1.6.6.1.1.1.2. Con: Entering into WTO would provide us with the same access to Europe as other non-European countries and any negotiations with regards specific tariffs would be scheduled later as we'd continue on current values. Going WTO is a scaremonger story and the reality is we import more than too Europe, WTO negotiations would be in our favour.[ukandeu.ac.uk](http://ukandeu.ac.uk/explainers/no-deal-the-wto-option/)
1.6.6.1.1.1.3. Pro: Continued EU membership [guarantees](http://foodresearch.org.uk/publications/feeding-britain-food-security-after-brexit/) the long term security of food.
1.6.6.1.1.1.4. Pro: UK trades internationally under EU WTO schedules and quotas, a Hard-Brexit will require immediate implementation of a [UK WTO Schedule and Quota](https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news18_e/mark_24jul18_e.htm). This does not exist and could take a long time to agree.
1.6.6.1.1.1.5. Con: In the absence of any agreement with the EU, imports from the EU will raise £12.9bn for the UK Treasury in duties, whilst UK exporters will face £5.2bn in total in tariffs on their exports to the EU. [blogs.lse.ac.uk](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/01/27/post-brexit-trade-can-thrive-under-wto-rules/)
1.6.6.1.1.1.6. Con: Reciprocal tariffs imposed on goods the EU sends to the UK would protect some British industries, contributing to economic growth.
1.6.6.1.1.1.6.1. Con: The UK is a net importer with the EU. [Imports exceeded exports by £7.6 billion](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/OverseasTradeStatistics/Pages/EU_and_Non-EU_Data.aspx) in April 2018.
1.6.6.1.1.1.7. Con: As Britain comprises [16%](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20170410-1) of EU GDP, reciprocal tariffs would hurt EU businesses as well, incentivising the agreement of sector-specific trade deals.
1.6.6.1.1.1.8. Pro: 75% of British fish is exported. Leaving the EU would put Britain in a position similar to Norway, which is subject to tariffs on exported fish, and has described this as a '[serious obstacle to trade](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-4043758/EU-trade-key-success-UK-fish-industry-75-home-caught-fish-exported-majority-fish-eaten-Britons-imported.html)'.
1.6.6.1.1.1.8.1. Con: Such a high level of exported fish indicates how in demand British fish is in the EU. The imposition of tariffs will hurt EU consumers first and foremost.
1.6.6.1.1.1.8.1.1. Con: Trade is not zero-sum: it is possible for tariffs to hurt both the exporter and the importer, and therefore both the UK and the EU.
1.6.6.1.1.1.8.1.1.1. Con: This would illustrate that the EU as a political organisation is willing to hurt its own citizens in order to protect its own narrow interests, which is a good argument in itself for the UK leaving such a spiteful club.
1.6.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.6.6.1.1.1.6.1.
1.6.6.1.3. Con: Currency depreciation also makes UK produced products [more expensive](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/21/why-pound-sterling-collapse-not-good-uk-economy-robert-skidelsky) as many of them are deeply integrated in foreign supply chains and need foreign imported inputs to produce. When sterling depreciates and import prices rise, the effect on export prices renders them less competitive.
1.6.6.2. Pro: This has [driven up inflation](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-inflation-latest-updates-news-pound-sterling-brexit-vote-prices-city-london-a7941921.html), reducing living standards for people living in the UK.
1.6.6.3. Pro: This is merely in response to the announcement of Brexit, not due to the economic effects of a hard Brexit \(tarriffs, trade barriers, passporting, etc\). Should a hard Brexit actually pass, there is likely to be another significant drop in the pound similar to what was experienced in June 2016.
1.6.6.4. Pro: Increased import prices that come with currency depreciation harm the British consumer as the UK economy [relies on imports](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-trade-deficit-latest-record-high-pound-sterling-slump-exports-goods-imports-brexit-a7992051.html).
1.6.7. Con: A hard Brexit may be the beginning of a more realistic and energetic growth period as happened in post-war [Germany and Japan](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/german-economic-miracle.asp). Perhaps this type of economic cull, even if it causes a period of pain, will lead to a much stronger and more efficient country.
1.6.7.1. Con: This is a poor analogy and is highly speculative. The UK isn't coming out of a lost war and changing its government system, it's leaving a single market customs union. Germany was split in half, Japan was ruled over by America for six years, and both were forced out of protectionist policies in the post-war period.  By contrast, the UK will actually be more protectionist in the years after Brexit, and the political class would have to experience massive changes to compare to Japan and Germany.
1.6.7.2. Con: The UK is not going to be a recipient of a massive foreign aid package like Germany was.
1.6.8. Pro: A Brexit reversal would have a beneficial impact on the UK's economy. This is because it would boost investor [certainty](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/17/reversing-brexit-second-referendum-would-have-positive-impact/) in the UK market.
1.6.9. Pro: The EU directs [considerable investment](http://blog.policy.manchester.ac.uk/brexit/2017/10/uk-regional-development-in-the-context-of-brexit/) towards poorer regions of the UK that the national government tends to ignore.
1.6.9.1. Con: This money is already UK money as the UK is a net contributor. People should speak to their local MP and change how they vote in general and local elections to effect how this money is spent alongside other forms of campaigning. Leaving the EU could therefore increase participation in politics in poorer regions of the UK. The EU spending money like this allows the UK government to get away with being less accountable for helping these regions.
1.6.9.2. Pro: The British government [spends significantly more money](https://www.ippr.org/news-and-media/press-releases/new-transport-figures-reveal-north-to-receive-indefensible-2-555-less-per-person-than-london) on transport infrastructure per head in London than anywhere else in the UK.
1.6.9.2.1. Con: This is because the London area has the oldest rail network, and is subject to the most strain with the largest population increase and thus increase in usage, of any location in the UK. Plus the fragmented nature of the network pushes up costs - London is the [hub](https://www.ft.com/content/d82848ca-f7ba-11e7-88f7-5465a6ce1a00) where a lot of this fragmentation meets.
1.6.9.2.1.1. Con: London does not have the UK's oldest train network. The rail networks around Liverpool, Manchester and most of Scotland are significantly older.
1.6.9.2.1.2. Pro: London's rail network is fragmented because it is run by 38 separate private contractors.
1.6.9.2.1.3. Con: Geographically, London is in no way the nexus point for the British railway. It is only the centre of this matrix by choice, not divine, immutable intervention.
1.6.9.3. Pro: The [European Investment Bank](http://www.eib.org/) is the largest multilateral investment bank in the world \(bigger than the World Bank\), and lent [36 billion euros](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7847) between 2011 and 2016 to British institutions, with less developed areas \(particularly in West Wales and the South West of England\) receiving more per person than other areas.
1.6.10. Con: The UK is too focused on ties to Europe. Diversified international trade deals are more lucrative.
1.6.10.1. Pro: Whilst the EU is a primary trading block, [compared](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Intra_EU_exports_of_goods_compared_with_Extra_EU_exports_of_goods_by_Member_State,_2016_\(%25\).png) to other major EU economies the UK is more tilted to trade outside the EU, giving it more resilience and more opportunities within other trade for good pacts.
1.6.10.2. Pro: Trade in non-physical goods rose \(80%\) from 2006-2016. Whereas physical goods had a \(40% increase\). So physical proximity will be increasingly [less important](https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/wts2017_e/WTO_Chapter_02_e.pdf) to overall trade. It's as easy to do financial services for someone on the other side of the planet as it is with a person in the country next to you.
1.6.10.2.1. Con: Working across timezones can cause problems
1.6.10.2.2. Con: Britain's economy is too [heavily reliant](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-financial-services-tax/britains-financial-sector-paid-record-71-4-billion-pounds-in-taxes-last-year-before-brexit-idUKKBN13V005) on our financial sector, which makes up around 12% of tax revenues. The global financial crisis demonstrated what can go wrong when you place too many eggs in one basket, leading to long term austerity which the UK is still paying for.
1.6.10.3. Pro: The 'anglosphere' of countries with English as a primary business language puts the UK at an advantage in new global trade deals with US/Canada/Australia/India/Nigeria.
1.6.10.3.1. Con: Countries within the EU teach English as a second language as it is considered the number one language for business in the world.
1.6.10.4. Con: Even if the US and Britain are able to come to an agreement quickly, Britain is [unable](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/22/the-uk-is-preparing-11-post-brexit-trade-deals-and-it-might-all-be-for-nothing.html), per EU rules, to sign new deals until the Brexit process is completed.
1.6.10.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.6.4.1.1.
1.6.10.4.2. Con: Although Britain cannot officially sign independent trade deals while still a member of the EU, Britain has [informal arrangements](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5315524/britain-lines-up-post-brexit-trade-deals/) with 36 countries to implement free trade agreements once Britain officially exits.
1.6.10.4.3. Con: It is unlikely any trade deal with another country will be signed immediately. Negotiations for any trade deal will take time, so the UK should start now rather than starting the process after it leaves the EU.
1.6.10.5. Con: Before the referendum Britain [relied](http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/23/news/economy/us-uk-trade-talks-start/index.html) on experienced EU negotiators to secure lucrative trade deals. Many of Britain's new trade officials are novices, and thus at a disadvantage negotiating new agreements.
1.6.10.5.1. Con: The Department for International Trade has [hired high-calibre trade negotiators](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/06/16/uk-hires-top-new-zealand-trade-negotiator-head-post-brexit-deals/) to fill the experience gap.
1.6.10.5.2. Pro: Not only is the British negotiating team not sufficiently qualified, they are also [understaffed](https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e): Whitehall's Trade Policy Group employ's 300 people, but the UK Trade Policy Observatory, an independent think-tank, says they need at least 700 people.
1.6.10.6. Con: If we carve up the world in terms wealth, most of the 35 most wealthy are in Europe. The rest are really far away e.g. US. Canada, Australia, China, India and Japan.
1.6.10.7. Pro: Commonwealth trade officials are currently pursuing [plans](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/mar/10/drive-to-replace-eu-trade-links-with-closer-ties-to-commonwealth-economies) for closer economic integration with the UK in the wake of Brexit.
1.6.10.7.1. Con: Good trade agreements are based on trust and goodwill. Theresa May has already damaged that through her "Hostile Environment" policies which led to the Windrush Scandal. "It is a matter of denial of the dignity of citizenship, which really cannot be restored," - Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. [uk.reuters.com](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-chogm-windrush/trouble-in-the-family-uks-migrant-embarrassment-undermines-commonwealth-reunion-idUKKBN1HQ1ZM)
1.6.10.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.2.1.
1.6.10.9. Pro: The UK could pursue membership in [NAFTA](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-nafta/britain-could-join-nafta-if-brexit-trade-deal-fails-telegraph-newspaper-idUSKBN1CF18K).
1.6.10.9.1. Con: Joining NAFTA would require the UK to conform to the regulatory framework of the deal for goods and services, a framework that is [significantly different](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/06/29/could-the-uk-join-nafta-there-are-considerable-downsides/) to the one that the UK currently has as a member of the EU. The highly complex legislative changes would make trade difficult with the EU, and would undermine stability in British markets.
1.6.10.9.1.1. Pro: To benefit from preferential market access into NAFTA, UK exporters would, in certain cases, have to [significantly restructure](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/06/29/could-the-uk-join-nafta-there-are-considerable-downsides/) their production, supply and distribution chains to comply with the North American trading zone’s product standards and rules of origin. Industries such as the automotive one would have to produce two versions of the same product to export to both EU and NAFTA markets.
1.6.10.9.2. Con: Joining NAFTA would [expose](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/06/29/could-the-uk-join-nafta-there-are-considerable-downsides/) a range of UK manufacturing and agriculture sectors to highly competitive US and Mexican exports, undermining domestic industry.
1.6.10.9.3. Con: The Trump administration is currently [renegotiating](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/business/how-the-trump-administration-is-doing-renegotiating-nafta.html) NAFTA. This means that not only will the UK have to wait for those negotiations to complete, it currently cannot know if the deal will actually be advantageous for it to join.
1.6.10.9.4. Pro: Joining NAFTA will increase trade with the US, Mexico, and Canada, whose combined GDP reached GPB 17.2 trillion in 2017. This [outweighs](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/10/britain-could-join-nafta-trade-alliance-us-canada-mexico-post/) the EU, at GPB 15.7 trillion.
1.6.10.9.5. Con: The effect of distance on trade is a well studied issue in economics. Whilst we could boost trade with other countries they will be further away, increasing the costs, so it is unlikely we will ever find ourselves trading as much with NAFTA or other distant trade organisations, as we will with countries in Europe. If we do it will be [more expensive, and more environmentally damaging](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/credit/documents/papers/11-02.pdf) than if we could trade with the EU.
1.6.10.10. Con: The EU remains Britain's [largest trade partner](https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-trade-partners/), accounting for 48% of goods exports from the UK in 2017, justifying Britain's focus on the EU.
1.6.10.11. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.2.1.4.
1.6.11. Con: The UK could create a more competitive environment for attracting companies.
1.6.11.1. Con: Many companies [are leaving or thinking about leaving](https://www.thenational.ae/business/economy/half-of-big-european-companies-cut-uk-investment-over-brexit-survey-shows-1.743895) the UK.
1.6.11.1.1. Pro: Even the pro-Brexit 'traitor' bashing [Daily Mail](https://twitter.com/AngryScotland/status/888820533512609793?s=19) is quietly considering moving to its Irish offices in Dublin to continue enjoying the benefits of EU membership.
1.6.11.2. Pro: The EU mandates that the UK not have less than a [15% VAT](http://www.blandbaker.co.uk/sites/www.blandbaker.co.uk/files/blandbakerpwp_apu_oct16_vatafterbrexit30.9.16.pdf). Once free from these regulations the UK could lower this and gain a competitive advantage to encourage growth and investment.
1.6.11.2.1. Con: As UK VAT currently stands at 20%, there was room for the Government to lower the tax without exiting the EU.
1.6.11.3. Con: The UK is already a competitive market for companies under the status quo. Trade barriers will only [harm](https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/jun/07/brexit-make-uk-businesses-less-competitive) this.
1.6.11.4. Pro: It has been [proposed](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/446407/brexit-uk-deregulation-parliament-should-seize-opportunity) that the UK could form a commission to cut back on EU regulations post Brexit by almost a quarter. This would save the UK between £33 billion \($43 billion\) and £140 billion \($182 billion\) annually and bring more industry and investment into the UK.
1.6.11.4.1. Con: EU regulations protect the health and safety of its citizens. Severely cutting them back would be a risky measure.
1.6.11.4.2. Con: EU officials have [stated](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-trade-deal-workers-rights-tax-haven-michel-barnier-environmental-legislation-a7851761.html) they will not sign a trade deal with the UK if they begin a deregulatory "race to the bottom".
1.6.11.4.3. Con: Deregulation doesn't automatically mean less stress on public finances or higher economic performance.
1.6.11.4.3.1. Pro: [Deregulation](https://smartasset.com/taxes/do-sin-taxes-affect-cigarette-and-alcohol-consumption) of drugs, tabacco and alcohol would lead to higher consumption of these substances and higher frequency of negative health related issues. Hence higher stress for NHS and public health budgets.
1.6.11.4.3.2. Pro: Unregulated capitalism leads to creation of monopolies, which in turn decreases competition.
1.6.12. Pro: The EU is responsible for the funding/loans behind many of the UK's largest infrastructure projects.
1.6.12.1. Pro: The macroeconomic effects and uncertainty caused by Brexit are likely to [slow down](https://www.squirepattonboggs.com/~/media/files/insights/publications/2016/06/eu-referendum-brexit-and-the-impact-on-uk-infrastructure/eureferendumukinfrastructurealert.pdf) infrastructure spending.
1.6.12.1.1. Pro: Werner Hoyer, president of the European Investment Bank, said it was [inevitable](https://www.ft.com/content/aaaaa9cc-b1b2-11e7-aa26-bb002965bce8) that lending to the UK would fall from recent levels of about £7bn a year once it left the EU.
1.6.12.1.2. Pro: The uncertainty around whether the new regulatory landscape of the UK will be in line with EU regulations is already [causing delays](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/15/uk-infrastructure-projects-could-be-hit-by-european-investment-bank-concerns) in investment, putting jobs at risk.
1.6.12.2. Pro: The UK is one of the largest shareholders \(16%\) in the European Investment Bank \(EIB\), granting it [considerable leverage](https://fullfact.org/economy/uks-stake-european-investment-bank/) to be able to direct the Bank's funding towards its own projects. By leaving the EU, and thereby leaving the Bank, the UK loses access to this pool of money.
1.6.12.2.1. Pro: The European Investment Bank loaned £1 billion towards the cost of [Crossrail](http://www.crossrail.co.uk/news/articles/tfl-agrees-1bn-loan-for-crossrail-from-european-investment-bank).
1.6.12.3. Con: The UK is [seeking to maintain its membership](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eib-european-investment-bank-davis-davis-eu-negotiations-a7932671.html) of the European Investment Bank \(EIB\) after Brexit. If that happens, there will be a minimal effect, if any, on procurement for infrastructure spending.
1.6.12.3.1. Con: In order for the UK to remain a member of the EIB, all the constitution of the Bank would have to be [amended](https://fullfact.org/economy/uks-stake-european-investment-bank/) and all remaining member states would have to agree to this change. This is by no means a given.
1.6.12.4. Con: With regards to funding, the UK is a [net contributor](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/) to the EU. This means that following Brexit the UK could fund all the currently EU funded projects in the UK and still have money left over. With regards to loans, if the UK wishes to borrow money it can do so. It is not necessary to borrow exclusively from the EU. The UK does not do so now and would not need to in the future.
1.6.12.4.1. Con: The problem with this argument is that it does not take into account the efficiencies generated by doing some things at the EU level. It will probably cost the UK more to do them on their own.  [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8SyXnDMfio)
1.6.13. Pro: A hard Brexit would result in short-term regulatory chaos.
1.6.13.1. Pro: When we leave the EU, we will become a 'third country' in terms of data protection. This will cause business no end of effort and expense when transferring data to the EEA and beyond, unless there is an 'adequacy decision' issued. [EU: the UK will be a 'third country' for personal data transfers from the point of Brexit](https://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2018/january/eu-the-uk-will-be-a-third-country-for-personal-data-transfers-from-the-point-of-brexit1/)
1.6.13.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.1.3.
1.6.13.3. Pro: [Inadequate customs contingency](https://www.ft.com/content/5ae67bea-ca0e-11e7-aa33-c63fdc9b8c6c) planning could lead to gridlock in Kent and resulting in delayed deliveries to businesses in the UK.
1.6.13.3.1. Pro: Sainsbury's, a major supermarket chain, is worried about [food rotting](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sainsburys-ceo-mike-coupe-brexit-food-eu-goods-uk-border-a7927606.html) at the border.
1.6.13.4. Pro: Leaving Euratom, the EU's atomic energy community, could cause [energy supplies to be disrupted](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39774062) due to the lack of equivalent national regulatory body, and the inability to source vital components from Europe.
1.6.13.5. Pro: Regulatory misalignment between the UK and EU could result in a [prohibition on data sharing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/brexit-could-put-data-sharing-jeopardy) between the two zones, causing serious problems for businesses.
1.6.13.6. Pro: [Insurance contracts](http://www.lmalloyds.com/LMA/News/Blog/brexit_cliffedge.aspx), vital to companies' ability to manage risk, could face serious difficulty transferring between UK and EU jurisdictions.
1.6.13.7. Pro: A hard Brexit will result in a [legal and regulatory no-man's land](http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-political-economic-and-legal-chaos-risked-by-a-no-deal-brexit-uk-changing-europe-2017-7) with nobody entirely confident of what laws and regulations still apply. Disputes will therefore take far longer to resolve, bringing up costs and throwing into disarray trade relations between businesses.
1.6.13.7.1. Pro: Many international contracts will [lack](https://www.ft.com/content/a9204df0-da84-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482) the details to deal with a new customs border between the UK and the EU. Potentially reviewing thousands of contracts will take a lot of time, but re-negotiating them will take significantly longer, increasing costs and creating a large degree of uncertainty.
1.6.13.8. Con: The UK is planning on [staying within the remit](https://www.ft.com/content/64d30780-10b5-11e7-b030-768954394623) of some of the regulatory agencies of the EU after Brexit, minimising the so-called regulatory upheaval.
1.6.13.8.1. Con: Without a trade deal or open borders, staying in any regulatory remit will mean very little.
1.6.13.9. Con: Brexit is a golden opportunity to get [rid](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2017/03/28/brexit-golden-chance-throw-eu-regulations-bonfire/) of cumbersome EU regulations that the UK has no need for.
1.6.13.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.11.4.
1.6.13.9.2. Con: Supporters of deregulation [won't identify](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-david-davis-tax-haven-cut-regulations-after-leaving-eu-based-on-nothing-european-commission-a8218481.html) or are [not upfront about](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/backlash-liam-foxs-total-secrecy-uk-us-trade-talks/) which regulations need to be scrapped and how they are currently cumbersome.
1.6.13.9.3. Con: It is not certain that deregulation will save money. In fact, the government's own [2014 report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/227069/2901084_SingleMarket_acc.pdf) into the functioning of the single market states "... integration has brought to \[...\] the UK, in most if not all observers’ opinions, appreciable economic benefits". \[...\] Is that trade-off, between cost and benefit, between economics and politics, of overall benefit to the UK? ... Most observers, and indeed most of the evidence received for this report, answer positively." \(p.6\).
1.6.13.9.4. Con: There is no certainty that a more deregulated society is a direction that would win support from the general public, especially when it comes to environmental and labour regulations. A future government hoping to be elected on such a manifesto might not get elected, and therefore, such deregulation may never get implemented. In short, these economical advantages are highly hypothetical and speculative, not just on an economical level, but also on the political level.
1.6.13.10. Pro: The UK will have to create national substitutes of the regulatory institutions that the UK benefits from as members of the EU. The UK will lose out on the economies of scale that the EU has and have costs in setting them up and running them.
1.6.14. Pro: -> See 1.6.6.1.1.1.
1.6.15. Con: The UK would save [billions of pounds](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/) in annual EU contributions.
1.6.15.1. Con: The net gain from leaving has to be compared to the loss to the economy from leaving the free trade area. The impact of leaving the free trade zone is [estimated](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-26/carney-says-u-k-economy-is-feeling-brexit-effect-in-short-term) to be greater than the savings in contributions to the EU  budget.
1.6.15.1.1. Pro: In addition to this we get considerable regional financial benefit from the EU which would reduce if the UK London based government took over.
1.6.15.2. Pro: The UK pays [more money](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/) into the EU budget than it gets back in EU spending in the UK. In 2016, the UK payed £13.1 billion and the EU in return spent £4.5 billion on the UK.
1.6.16. Con: The EU is not the place where most economic growth is occurring. The EU’s share of world GDP is forecast to [decline](http://www.betteroffout.net/the-case/10-eu-myths-about-withdrawl/) to 22% in 2025, down from 37% in 1973.
1.6.16.1. Con: This argument confuses growth with total volume in economic activity. Many areas of high relative growth still represent small markets. Even with slower growth relative to the rest of the world, the EU will remain the [UK's largest export market](https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-trade-partners/).
1.6.16.2. Con: This argument neglects the barriers to trade imposed by geography. Even with falling transport costs, these act to increase the cost of UK goods in more distant markets such as China, Japan, and North and South America.
1.6.16.3. Con: This claim misleadingly suggests that EU trade is shrinking, by confusing GDP and growth with share of total world trade.  The EU has a smaller total share of world trade, because countries like China, India and South Korea have grown very quickly and now take much larger shares of total world trade than they used to. As more middle income countries grow, everyone is sharing a much bigger pie, meaning smaller percentages don't automatically mean less pie.
1.6.17. Con: Economic forecasts are inherently unreliable due to the infinite range of variables involved. Given that, it is impossible to accurately predict the economic consequences of Brexit, or whether the UK economy would be better off in or out of the EU.
1.6.17.1. Pro: The [Bank of England](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/715480/Carney-Brexit-Bank-England-admits-Britain-economic-outlook-POSITIVE-EU) and [David Cameron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDS027L8YMo&app=desktop) made very pessimistic predictions during the referendum about the impact of a leave vote and then later admitted these were overstated.
1.6.17.2. Con: Economic forecasts are not predictions. They are a tool that supports evidence based policy making, such as the [decision](https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/economy/economic-growth/news/77895/bank-england-cuts-interest-rates-and-boosts-quantitative) of the Bank of England after the referendum vote to cut interest rates and boost quantitive easing, to ward off the worst effects of the fall of the pound.
1.6.17.3. Con: If the claim is that it is impossible to accurately predict the economic consequences of Brexit, then that claim makes its own argument for not leaving the EU.
1.6.17.3.1. Con: The future is uncertain inside or outside of the EU. Remaining within the EU is no guarantee of economic success, as any youth from Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain etc will tell you. Economic predictions should not be used in any way to make decisions of this sort.
1.6.17.3.2. Con: Given the hypothetical situation of being in an EU which presented a severely detrimental return on a member country's investment, in that situation it may be deemed better for that country to leave and face uncertainty.
1.6.18. Con: Damage to the UK economy was advised by both side during the campaign, with different degree of the damage, majority decided that other benefits will overbalance short economy disadvantages.
1.6.18.1. Con: Warnings of economic damage were almost always dismissed as 'Project Fear' by Leave politicians. Many people weren't aware of any short term damage to the economy and some Leavers now predict up to 30 years of 'short term' economic pain. [Link](https://twitter.com/OFOCBrexit/status/1009884621306302464?s=19)
1.6.19. Con: If there is no agreement in place at the point of leaving there would be no legal [obligation](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39294904) for the UK to make any payment as part of a financial settlement, saving them a large amount of money.
1.6.19.1. Pro: The UK can leave the EU without a deal and negotiations for a new arrangement can continue. As a deal will last for many years, if not forever, it is critical to obtain a fair deal and not enter into a bad deal .
1.6.19.2. Con: Not paying for agreed commitments would destroy goodwill and trust towards the UK, which will diminish our ability to negotiate any beneficial new trade deals, whether with the EU or others.
1.6.20. Pro: UK companies that participate in security-sensitive EU industry collaborations would suffer.
1.6.20.1. Pro: Britan's satellite industry might very well lose out on the [Galileo](https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21741593-britain-struggles-stay-europes-most-important-space-project-britains-space-industry) project.
1.6.20.2. Pro: Airbus has already [announced](https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21741593-britain-struggles-stay-europes-most-important-space-project-britains-space-industry) that it will move part of it's satellite making operations from Britain to France.
1.7. Con: The EU is too dysfunctional for the UK.
1.7.1. Pro: The EU wastes[vast sums of money](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201310/20131025ATT73477/20131025ATT73477EN.pdf) in [decamping](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-20096221/eu-parliament-s-journeys-from-strasbourg-to-brussels) from [Brussels to Strasbourg](https://news.sky.com/story/meps-on-the-move-madness-of-strasbourg-shift-10293596) every month. If the EU is incapable of making the trivial decision to end this farce how can we have any trust in it's ability to handle decisions that are actually challenging.
1.7.1.1. Con: This is not an example of the EU being dysfunctional per se. It is also not a trivial decision, nor particularly challenging. The policy may be annoying and a strange distribution of wealth - one that ultimately benefits both towns at the expense of the entire block - but does not demonstrate dysfunction.
1.7.1.2. Pro: 91% of MEPs [oppose the commuting](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-European-parliament-move-from-Brussels-to-Strasbourg-once-a-month), with France the only country benefiting.
1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.
1.7.3. Pro: The EU has failed to address many of the [economic problems](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/17/europe-in-turmoil-five-years-of-economic-crisis) that have developed since 2008.
1.7.3.1. Con: It is not an agreed area of EU competence to intervene in sovereign member states' economic affairs. Therefore it is not to be expected that the EU would address member states' internal economic problems. This point appears to conflate EU membership with the adoption of the Euro, which clearly the UK has not joined. And the link in question is very old news.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Economies in Southern Europe still face [over 20%](https://tradingeconomics.com/greece/unemployment-rate) rates of unemployment compared to Northern European economies like Germany which enjoys [under 5%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnmauldin/2016/07/05/3-reasons-brits-voted-for-brexit/#53545e6d1f9d) unemployment rates. This system of inequality continues to put a strain on the union.
1.7.3.2.1. Con: The only country with \>20% unemployment in the EU is [Greece](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268830/unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/).
1.7.3.3. Con: Many countries outside the EU, especially the USA, also suffered a deep recession starting in 2008. Blaming the EU for this is wrong.
1.7.3.3.1. Con: The US was able to recover strongly from its recession because of [stimulus policies](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/upshot/what-debate-economists-agree-the-stimulus-lifted-the-economy.html), which the EU has been unwilling and unable to carry out. The EU has not recovered in many regions. Therefore it is sensible to blame the structure and policies of the EU.
1.7.3.3.1.1. Con: Britain was slow in helping it's own economy due to tight austerity measures which George Osborne [later relaxed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/by-george-britains-austerity-experiment-didnt-work) due to stagnant growth.
1.7.3.3.1.2. Pro: Coordinated stimulus is a difficult policy to carry out due to the [lack](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/01/greece-problems-eurozone-fiscal-policy-germany) of unity in the monetary and fiscal policy of the EU.
1.7.3.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.10.1.2.
1.7.4. Con: Dysfunction is completely subjective. Who's to say what is normal for a union of countries like those in Europe. The fact that they exist and have 28 member states strongly suggests that they are not, "[deviating from the norms of social behavior in a way regarded as bad](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dysfunctional)."
1.7.4.1. Con: If the structure of the EU leads to harmful externalities for its member states, this should be a relevant factor in the decision for the UK to remain or leave in the event of a hard Brexit.
1.7.5. Con: It isn't entirely clear if the EU is any more or less dysfunctional than the UK, as supported by [recent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-parliaments-43791047) [revelations](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/25/number-of-windrush-cases-passes-5000-mark) about the Home Office
1.7.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.5.
1.8. Pro: A hard Brexit threatens the constitutional set-up of the United Kingdom and its associated territories, more so than overturning the referendum result and staying in the EU.
1.8.1. Con: A hard brexit is simply an excuse used by people who wanted to threaten the unity of the United Kingdom before the Brexit referendum was even a glimmer in David Cameron's eye.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Sinn Fein has [long been calling for reunification](http://www.firstdail.com/?page_id=208) of the island of Ireland since well before the EU referendum.
1.8.1.2. Pro: The SNP has long [been calling for](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014) secession of Scotland.
1.8.1.3. Pro: Welsh nationalists have [long been calling for](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_nationalism) secession of Wales.
1.8.1.4. Con: Brexit gives weight to nationalist political parties who will insist that England is forcing its own agenda on Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
1.8.2. Pro: A hard Brexit would throw into disarray the constitutional arrangement between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which represents a serious threat to the peace of the citizens of Northern Ireland.
1.8.2.1. Pro: The EU contributed to [8.4%](http://www.paxetbellum.org/2017/03/21/could-brexit-summon-the-ghosts-of-the-troubles/) of the Northern Irish GDP through financial aid. Without its support the Northern Irish economy will suffer.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: This was the UK's money to begin with. The UK government has [already committed](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/dup-deal-latest-how-much-extra-money-funding-theresa-may-conservative-tory-uk-taxpayers-a7809231.html) to very significant increases in NI funding.
1.8.2.1.2. Con: Westminster is likely to offer more financial support to plug the gap, both because of the [DUP's position](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-may/may-strikes-1-billion-deal-with-dup-to-prop-up-government-idUKKBN19H0H3) in Theresa May's government, and to ensure stability.
1.8.2.1.3. Con: This assumes a post Brexit UK will not be able to secure new lucrative trade opportunities, which is very much up for debate.
1.8.2.2. Con: There is no constitutional legal barrier to the UK leaving the EU. The constitutional arrangement between NI and the rest of the UK predates the EU.
1.8.2.3. Con: The party which won 55% of NI seats in the 2017 general election campaign had a [manifesto committment to leave the EU](https://brexitcentral.com/dup-manifesto-said-brexit/), and to renege on this would throw into disarray the constitutional arrangement between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which represents a serious threat to peace for the citizens of Northern Ireland.
1.8.2.3.1. Con: Manifesto commitments are often [dropped](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/22/theresa-may-u-turn-on-dementia-tax-cap-social-care-conservative-manifesto) by Governments when proved to be unpopular or unworkable.
1.8.2.4. Con: There are already significant legal and tax differences either side of the Irish border.  It is therefore likely that further changes, if properly implemented in the way the Government has described, will NOT lead to an increase in violence.
1.8.2.4.1. Pro: The UK government has [repeatedly stated](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-41365301) there will be no Irish border posts.
1.8.2.4.1.1. Con: Stating something does not make it real. A stated desire for no border posts is a negotiating position, not a fact.
1.8.2.5. Pro: A hard Brexit could lead to a secession of Northern Ireland to rejoin the Republic of Ireland and the European Union.
1.8.2.5.1. Con: This could happen anyway independent of Brexit.
1.8.2.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.1.
1.8.2.5.2. Pro: Northern Ireland voted to Remain in the EU by a [10% margin](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results) \(55-45\).
1.8.2.5.3. Con: The Democratic Unionist Party, the [largest party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly) in the Northern Irish Assembly, is [opposed](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/4172307.stm) to seccession.
1.8.2.5.3.1. Con: The politics of Ireland are incredibly volatile, there has not been a Government in Northern Ireland [since January 2017](https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21731338-belfasts-politicians-continue-bicker-brexit-talks-go-without-them-northern-ireland-hasnt) due to the collapse of power sharing. Therefore the continuation of the DUP as the major party in Northern Ireland is not guaranteed.
1.8.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: The Unionist Parties \([pro-union](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/4172307.stm) with the UK\) hold only a [small plurality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly) over the Nationalist Parties \([pro-unification](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/4172307.stm) with Southern Ireland\) in the Northern Irish Assembly.
1.8.2.5.4. Pro: The tightening of border controls, which would be necessary after a hard Brexit, will increase support for the succession of Northern Ireland.
1.8.2.5.4.1. Pro: A hard Brexit would lead to the return of an enforced border between Northern Ireland and The Republic of Ireland.
1.8.2.5.4.1.1. Pro: The fact there are no customs checks on the border [is reliant on](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42180074) Northern Ireland and The Republic of Ireland having the same food, animal welfare, environmental, and other standards. Without these, customs checks would be needed.
1.8.2.5.4.1.2. Con: The border could be, in effect, [moved to the Irish Sea](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42180074), leaving Northern Ireland effectively within the EU.
1.8.2.5.4.1.2.1. Con: This would effectively allow Northern Ireland a "back door" into the EU market. In the context of a hard Brexit this would likely be unacceptable to the EU member states.
1.8.2.5.4.1.2.2. Con: Both the UK government and the DUP in Northern Ireland have [ruled out](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42180074) this option.
1.8.2.5.4.1.2.2.1. Con: The UK government have ruled out membership of the single market and the customs union. They've ruled out a hard border across the island. They've ruled out a border down the Irish Sea. This is, for obvious reasons, a logically incoherent position. The UK will have no choice but to renege on one of these commitments.
1.8.2.5.5. Con: Even after the Brexit vote, support in Northern Ireland for reunification only stands at [22%](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/sharp-rise-in-support-for-united-ireland-survey-reveals-1.2784882).
1.8.2.5.5.1. Con: While [22 per cent](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/sharp-rise-in-support-for-united-ireland-survey-reveals-1.2784882?mode=amp) seems a low percentage, what is important is that it was a five-point increase in support for a United Ireland from 17 per cent in 2013. Since 2016 when this poll was taken support has continued to rise.
1.8.2.5.5.1.1. Pro: In a [poll](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/13/theresa-may-just-negotiated-away-the-united-kingdom/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) taken in December 2017 a majority in Northern Ireland \(51 percent\) supported unification under the Irish Republic to remain in the European Union in the event of a “hard” Brexit.
1.8.2.6. Pro: The possibility of a no-deal Brexit has already [shifted the balance](https://www.independent.co.uk/author/mary-dejevsky) in Northern Ireland.
1.8.2.7. Pro: Preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could be [incompatible](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/06/brexit-bind-hard-border-ireland-could-unavoidable-uks-customs/) with leaving the Customs Union.
1.8.2.7.1. Con: This is a solvable problem according to the British government and [the former Taoiseach \(Prime Minister\) of Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/bertie-ahern-technology-and-turning-blind-eye-could-solve-brexit-border-issue-1.3306710).
1.8.2.7.1.1. Pro: One possible solution that has been [mooted](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/bertie-ahern-technology-and-turning-blind-eye-could-solve-brexit-border-issue-1.3306710?mode=amp) is to introduce technology to manage multinational trade while turning a blind eye to lower-level cross-frontier movement.
1.8.2.7.1.1.1. Con: "Turning a blind eye" allows the movement of EU immigrants into the UK and vice versa. Brexit was claimed to be about taking back control of our borders. ROI/EU also has the right to controlled migration from the UK of both UK citizens and migrants we allow in too.
1.8.2.8. Pro: A hard exit from the EU could call the [Good Friday Agreement](http://politicalcritique.org/world/uk/2017/what-would-a-hard-brexit-mean-for-ireland/) into question and could possibly cause a return to the violence and terror present in Northern Ireland during [The Troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles).
1.8.2.8.1. Con: There is nothing in the Good Friday Agreement that prohibits the UK leaving the EU.
1.8.2.8.1.1. Con: The Good Friday Agreement makes references to both the UK and the Republic of Ireland being part of the EU as well as an open border. Creating a hard border would violate the terms of the agreement and hence would need to be rewritten with consent from both sides. History has proved this to be very difficult. [Good Friday Agreement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-belfast-agreement)
1.8.2.8.2. Pro: The Sinn Féin President, [Gerry Adams](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-northern-irealand-gerry-adams-sinn-fein-good-friday-agreement-peace-eu-a7539011.html), argued that Brexit will ‘destroy the Good Friday Agreement’, being at odds with consent for change, undermining its human rights elements and reinforcing the border.
1.8.2.8.3. Pro: Violence has never fully ceased in Northern Ireland and so it would not be a large stretch for it to return to the way it was before the Good Friday Agreement.
1.8.2.8.3.1. Pro: On Feb 2017 there was a [bomb explosion](https://m.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/derry-bomb-culmore-device-at-police-officers-home-more-intricate-than-a-basic-pipe-bomb-35472857.html) at a police officer’s house in Derry/Londonderry. It is suspected that this was planned by violent dissident republicans.
1.8.2.8.4. Pro: Irish member of parliament [Neale Richmond](http://nationalpost.com/news/world/is-brexit-going-to-restart-the-troubles-in-northern-ireland) warned that border posts would be a “target for dissident paramilitaries.”
1.8.2.8.4.1. Con: -> See 1.8.2.4.1.
1.8.2.8.5. Pro: The Police Service of Northern Ireland has [observed](https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/twt/brexit-s-threat-northern-ireland) that dissident Republicans and criminal gangs will also seek to tap into the smuggling opportunity presented by a customs border. This could lead to reorganization of old groups as well as new financial streams for them.
1.8.2.8.6. Con: Irish Republicans currently [lack](https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/twt/brexit-s-threat-northern-ireland) political leadership to organize violence.
1.8.2.8.6.1. Con: While they lack a prominent leader this does not seem to be stifling growth. Republican clubs and societies – broadly supportive of armed violence against the British state and not directly controlled by the Sinn Féin leadership − are [increasingly active](https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/twt/brexit-s-threat-northern-ireland) in border communities, drawing energy from the anger that has swelled in these areas since the Brexit vote.
1.8.2.8.7. Con: The UK will no doubt have to [increase support for peace](https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/twt/brexit-s-threat-northern-ireland) programs and negotiate a new border policy. But with sensible policies peace in Northern Ireland can be maintained.
1.8.2.8.8. Pro: Brexit occurs at a time when[shifting demographics in Northern Ireland](https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/catholic-population-set-to-dwarf-protestants-in-years-ahead-1-7872318) are tipping in favour of nationalists. Already, in the most recent elections, the unionist majority has disappeared. Within a decade, there will be a significant nationalist [majority in favour of unification](https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/news-analysis/demographics-are-shifting-towards-a-united-ireland-we-must-have-a-plan-35865222.html). Tensions between communities are running high and there is truly the potential for a return to conflict and violence. Everything must be done to ensure the GFA is protected and a hard border across the island is avoided.
1.8.3. Con: The constitutional set-up of the United Kingdom has always been under threat for reasons that have nothing to do with Brexit. A democratically implemented change to the set-up is not necessarily a bad thing, and certainly not a reason to undermine the very constitution by not respecting the referendum result.
1.8.4. Pro: A hard Brexit could trigger a second independence referendum within Scotland.
1.8.4.1. Con: This could happen anyway. All voters in the first Scottish referendum were aware there was an upcoming referendum on EU membership and so this was factored in to voting decisions.
1.8.4.1.1. Con: The campaign for Scotland remaining in the UK stated:["What is process for removing our EU citizenship? Voting yes."](https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584?lang=en) This suggests voters did not factor this in to their decision. In fact, it claimed that their desire to stay in the EU was a reason to vote for the Union, whereas today they would more likely to see independence as the best route to staying in the EU.
1.8.4.2. Con: The SNP is unlikely to hold a second independence referendum as only [46%](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/what-the-latest-polls-tell-us-about-scottish-independence-1-4636493) of Scots support it.
1.8.4.2.1. Pro: The Scottish National Party does not have an [established timeframe](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/27/nicola-sturgeon-shelves-second-independence-referendum) for a second referendum, showing no current intention to push for one.
1.8.4.2.2. Pro: It is highly unlikely that the SNP will choose to call for a second referendum unless they're certain to win, as a loss would be a devastating blow to their party.
1.8.4.3. Pro: If Brexit proves to harm the UK economy as many people predict, then it could persuade enough people in Scotland to leave the UK. During the original Scottish Independence Referendum, the Better Together website said: “Scotland enjoys membership of the EU because of our membership of the UK and if we no longer are members of the UK then it follows that we are no longer part of the EU.” [Link](https://www.snp.org/broken_promises_by_tories_and_no_campaign_since_indyref). Scots who voted to stay in the UK for continued EU membership now feel cheated as a result of Brexit.
1.8.4.4. Pro: First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon claims it is ["likely"](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-40415457) that a referendum will take place before 2021.
1.8.4.4.1. Pro: The Scottish Government were elected on a manifesto that said they would seek to hold another referendum in the event of a vote for Brexit. They won a majority of seats at UK and Scottish level on this manifesto.
1.8.4.4.2. Con: It is in the interests of the leader of the Scottish National Party to claim a second referendum will take place, as it will keep her hard nationalist base happy. Her statements should not be read as accurate predictions.
1.8.4.4.3. Con: It is impossible for there to be another Independence Referendum without approval from the Prime Minister under [Section 30 of the Scotland Act](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/section-30-scotland-act-1998-important/).
1.8.4.5. Pro: Scotland voted overwhelmingly to stay within the European Union, a margin of [62% to 38%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results), with every single electorate returning a majority in favour of Remain.
1.8.5. Con: Remaining in the EU would represent an equal or even greater threat to the integrity of the UK.
1.8.5.1. Pro: [England and Wales could revolt](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/12/england-wales-eu-brexit-article-50), seceding from NI and Scotland and leaving the EU. NI would then have to decide who to go with, ROI or not. Scotland would jump for joy until the EU told them that they'd have to join the Euro and weren't allowed to catch their own fish.
1.8.5.2. Pro: Nicola Sturgeon could smell blood and use it as an excuse to ram through another independence vote, capitalising on the collapse in support of pro-brexit Tory and labour voters for Westminster elites.
1.8.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.8.4.2.
1.8.5.3. Con: It would be Vince Cable's time to shine, and he would ride into 10 Downing St on a rainbow as the hero of Europeans everywhere and unite the nation with his stirring rhetorical flourish.
1.8.6. Con: Strong independence movements exist within the European Union, as illustrated by the recent [crisis in Catalonia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-41584864). There's no reason to believe that remaining in the EU would protect the UK from secession.
1.8.6.1. Con: Calatonian independence movement is [pro EU](https://frontnews.eu/news/en/13858/Catalonia-wants-to-stay-in-European-Union-president-of-Catalan-Government). In the UK Northern Ireland independence movement [wants to get independence](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/northern-ireland-support-join-irish-republic-eu-hard-brexit-poll-lucidtalk-a8098531.html) mainly because after Brexit the free border with Ireland will be closed, resulting in [huge damages](https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/brexit/predicted-brexit-hit-to-northern-ireland-economy-reality-check-for-may-and-dup-36580101.html) for the Northern Ireland economy and in a hard divison of the island.
1.8.6.2. Con: Ruling by example is good choice. It's difficult to claim union while breaking up bigger commitments in pro of equality in terms of rights and obligations
1.8.7. Pro: A hard Brexit threatens British sovereignty over Gibraltar \(a small territory [bordering Southern Spain](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Gibraltar/\@36.218638,-5.4795662,9z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0xd0cbf762714be35:0x384e25263600870f!8m2!3d36.140751!4d-5.353585)\).
1.8.7.1. Con: A change to the status of Gibraltar would not alter the constitutional set-up of the UK, as Gibraltar is not part of the UK.
1.8.7.1.1. Con: Gibraltar is part of the Overseas Territories of the UK, and therefore it affects the constitution of the UK by proxy.
1.8.7.2. Con: Spain's primary route to bullying and threatening the people of Gibraltar is through its use of [veto](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/07/will-the-uk-lose-gibraltar) in the EU. If there is no deal with the EU, Spain has nothing to veto. A soft Brexit is therefore much more threatening to Gibraltar.
1.8.7.2.1. Con: Spain's veto applies to any future EU deals, and so while a no deal may leave Spain temporarily with nothing to veto, when the UK eventually makes a trade deal with the EU Spain will still be able to use it.
1.8.7.3. Pro: Spain has been [awarded a veto](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/07/will-the-uk-lose-gibraltar) on all trade deals with Gibraltar in future EU negotiations. It could use this to strong-arm Gibraltar to accept Spanish sovereignty.
1.9. Pro: A hard Brexit will hurt the scientific community in the UK.
1.9.1. Con: A hard Brexit will improve scientific research in the UK.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Brexit will increase International non-EU collaborations.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: There are a series of [structural reasons](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2015/12/05/debunking-the-myths-about-british-science-after-an-eu-exit/) which make international collaborations within the EU effective. It is unlikely that collaborations outside the EU can replicate these conditions.
1.9.1.1.1.1. Pro: The centralised funding [substantially reduces bureaucracy](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2015/12/05/debunking-the-myths-about-british-science-after-an-eu-exit/) when it comes to arranging international collaborations.
1.9.1.1.1.2. Pro: The shared political interest in promoting EU science means that the [best laboratory](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2015/12/05/debunking-the-myths-about-british-science-after-an-eu-exit/) can be chosen to perform a particular task without preferentially selecting national funding for work in the country it is sourced from.
1.9.1.1.1.3. Pro: Centralised funding means that there is [less risk](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2015/12/05/debunking-the-myths-about-british-science-after-an-eu-exit/) in engaging in international collaborations, as there is no chance that your collaborator may lose, or fail to acquire, funding.
1.9.1.1.2. Con: There is [no indication](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2015/12/05/debunking-the-myths-about-british-science-after-an-eu-exit/) that the EU reduces other international collaborations, as it already works with 170 countries around the world.
1.9.1.2. Pro: A proportion of current EU-funded non-UK EU scientists who are working in the UK will have been hired over non-EU \(and potentially UK\) scientists for reasons of [administrative ease, visa quotas, funding stipulations etc](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/non-eu-scholars-struggling-with-the-uks-visa-policy/2010106.article) rather than on merit alone. Post-Brexit, non-EU individuals will not be structurally disadvantaged relative to EU individuals.  Hiring foreign scientists based solely on merit rather than citizenship will increase the quality of the scientific research carried out in the UK.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: Money is an issue, however. A significant portion of the funding which is required for those jobs comes from EU sources. The figures vary from sector to sector, but it is roughly [15%](https://fullfact.org/education/how-much-money-do-british-universities-get-eu/) in [general funding](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2016/university-funding-explained.pdf), and according to Universities UK, [overall EU research funding generated over 19,000 full-time-equivalent jobs in the UK in 2014/2015](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2016/economic-impact-of-eu-research-funding-in-uk-universities.pdf) \(p4\). Thus, leaving the EU might mean prioritising non-EU hires in theory, but the money to hire them would be reduced.
1.9.1.2.1.1. Con: No funding is guaranteed, and the EU could equally have withdrawn it in the future.  As the UK is a net payer into the EU, this funding is really UK money, anyway.
1.9.1.2.1.2. Con: Quantity does not mean quality when it comes to scientific research.
1.9.1.3. Con: Ending free movement will restrict the ability of scientists to work across international boundaries and reduce the pool of scientists from which UK institutions can be drawn.
1.9.2. Pro: Brexit threatens the scientific workforce.
1.9.2.1. Pro: More than [half of all scientists](https://www.nature.com/news/brexit-vote-drives-uk-academics-to-think-about-leaving-1.21259) reported that Brexit had increased the likelihood of them leaving. This was even higher for non-UK EU citizens, at over three quarters.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: "More likely" does not mean "likely" or indicate how much more likely.
1.9.2.1.2. Con: It is common for people to overestimate the impact that political votes will have on their future actions.
1.9.2.2. Pro: [31,000 academics](https://www.nature.com/news/brexit-by-the-numbers-the-fear-of-brain-drain-1.21142), or about 16% of the university-based workforce, are non-UK EU citizens. A hard Brexit would end their residency rights.
1.9.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.9.1.2.
1.9.2.2.2. Pro: Many academic staff currently do not earn [enough money](https://www.nature.com/news/brexit-by-the-numbers-the-fear-of-brain-drain-1.21142) to qualify for a tier 2 visa for skilled workers.
1.9.2.2.2.1. Con: As a sovereign country the UK can adjust its visa system to meet its needs.
1.9.2.3. Pro: Applications to UK-based scientific research programs by foreign nationals have dramatically [dropped](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-08-08/brexit-guts-british-science-and-risks-graphene-innovation) since the referendum.
1.9.3. Pro: Brexit will reduce EU collaborations.
1.9.3.1. Con: -> See 1.9.1.1.
1.9.3.2. Con: Some notable collaborations, such as [CERN](http://www.epsnews.eu/2016/07/cern-statement-about-uk-referendum-on-the-eu/), are not contingent upon EU membership.
1.9.3.3. Pro: Outside the European Union, Britain will no longer [host](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/06/researchers-deplore-uk-decision-leave-european-union) the European Medicines Agency, which evaluates medicinal products throughout the EU and has 890 employees. Instead the Agency and those scientists will [relocate](http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Press_release/2017/11/WC500238862.pdf) to Amsterdam.
1.9.3.3.1. Con: This will not affect scientific research in the UK, and so only affects an extremely small proportion of the scientific community.
1.9.3.4. Con: Non-EU [scientists](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2091490-vote-brexit-and-british-science-will-still-be-a-powerhouse/) from Israel and Switzerland have been part of the European Research Council. There is no reason Britain's scientists cannot do the same after Brexit.
1.9.3.4.1. Pro: Israel and Switzerland win more [funding](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/championship-form-uk-leads-european-research-council-cash) per capita than UK researchers, and have similar success rates when attempting to obtain grants.
1.9.3.4.1.1. Con: Switzerland \(2.8 percent\) and Israel \(4.4 percent\) spend proportionally [more](https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/apr/06/eu-brexit-scientific-impact-complicated) of their GDP on R&D than Britain \(1.7 percent\), making it easier for them to obtain research grants from the EU. It is unlikely that the UK will match them in spending anytime soon, given the economic consequences of Brexit.
1.9.3.4.2. Con: These associate members attend Research Council meetings in an [observer](https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/apr/06/eu-brexit-scientific-impact-complicated) capacity only, and consequently their abilities to shape research policy are limited.
1.9.3.5. Pro: The UK [won](https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/apr/06/eu-brexit-scientific-impact-complicated) research grants valued at GBP 1.7 billion during the last funding period of the European Research Council. By contrast Germany won grants valued at GBP 1.1 billion.
1.9.3.5.1. Con: The ERC is not the only source of funding for UK scientific research, and so even if these funds are lost \(which is not necessarily the case as other non-EU countries receive ERC funds\) they could be compensated for through other sources.
1.9.3.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.3.4.1.
1.9.4. Pro: Britain receives around 60% more money from the EU for research funding than it contributes to the EU for research \(Royal Society [pg. 12](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/eu-uk-funding/uk-membership-of-eu.pdf)\).
1.9.4.1. Con: There is not a linear correlation between money and scientific excellence. Many US universities are considerably [better funded](https://www.nonprofitcollegesonline.com/wealthiest-universities-in-the-world/) than Oxbridge and yet Oxbridge [consistently outranks](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2018/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats) them.
1.9.4.1.1. Con: Cutting science funding will not produce more or better research.
1.9.5. Con: The UK can have better scientific research outside the EU as evidenced by the fact that many countries outside the EU have better scientific research programmes than many countries inside the EU.
1.9.5.1. Con: Such countries did not undergo an unprecedented exit from a supranational bloc. This makes it difficult to compare their situations' to a Britain that has opted for a hard Brexit.
1.9.5.2. Con: Research in EU-member states has developed massively thanks to the presence of [EU-funded projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Sk%C5%82odowska-Curie_Actions) and its supra-national institutes \(such as [EMBL](https://www.embl.org/)\). Many of these have [premises in UK](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/). Brexit will change this mainly for UK, as researchers that are working in the aforementioned projects will relocate to EU-member states.
1.9.5.3. Pro: Nations such as Australia and the United States currently [recruit](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2091490-vote-brexit-and-british-science-will-still-be-a-powerhouse/) more international researchers than Britain, which shows that membership in a supranational organization is not a prerequisite for success in this regard.
1.9.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.9.5.1.
1.9.6. Con: The UK will no longer be beholden to burdensome EU regulations.
1.9.6.1. Pro: Following the adoption of the EU Clinical Trials Directive, which added additional costs and bureaucracy to the approval process, the UK's popularity as a destination for clinical trials markedly [fell](https://clinicalaccelerator.com/2014/07/22/nhs-declining-uk-position-on-the-clinical-trial-stage/).
1.9.6.1.1. Con: The EU Clinical Trials Directive was created with the aim to protect patients. While it initially imposed too much of a regulatory burden, the UK has worked closely with the rest of the EU to [reform](https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/feb/19/europes-framework-for-clinical-trials-is-good-news-for-uk-scientists-and-patients) the directive, in order to streamline regulations. This is a clear example of the UK operating within the EU framework to resolve an issue.
1.9.6.2. Con: EU regulations ensure research is undertaken in a safe, sustainable, ethical and accountable way.
1.9.6.3. Con: For example, the 'burdensome' EU regulations that prevent pesticides that devastate biodiversity from being used freely across Europe, thereby protecting the environmental resources on which scientific research \(and a lot more\) depends. It's policies like these, that benefit everyone \(except the likes of Monsanto\)[, that the British government seeks to block](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/22/tories-aim-block-full-eu-ban-bee-harming-pesticides)
1.10. Con: The UK should be able to control and limit its immigration policy as it sees fit.
1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.1.3.
1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.1.4.
1.10.3. Pro: The UK needs the power to restrict entry into the country in order to maintain its ability to provide for the needs of its citizens in the future, otherwise an unemployment crisis in the rest of the EU could burden the UK with an influx of people in need.
1.10.4. Con: The UK can sufficiently control immigration while remaining in the EU.
1.10.4.1. Pro: EU citizens only have the right to reside in the UK for longer than 3 months if they work, or if they are self-sufficient \(including dependents\), students, or accompanying family members - [Article 7 of the Citizenship Directive](http://www.eearegulations.co.uk/CitizensRightsDirective/ByPage/Article_07).
1.10.4.1.1. Con: While the claim is true that as a nation we could assert controls on EU migrants who are not financially independent, we're reliant on EU law to do this and we would still be restricted in our ability to control the flow of EU workers.
1.10.4.1.2. Con: It is not enough for the UK to maintain partial control. These rules significantly infringe on the UK's ability to regulate immigration as it sees fit, which de-prioritizes the national interest.
1.10.4.1.2.1. Pro: An uncontrolled influx of cheap labour suppresses wages and benefits business owners at the expense of the working classes.
1.10.4.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.9.2.1.
1.10.4.1.2.2. Pro: An uncontrolled flux of migrant workers makes it difficult for Government to plan for and train citizens in critical industries to prevent skills shortages.
1.10.4.1.3. Con: EU spouses of UK citizens who earn less than £18,600 are still able to live in the UK and burden the social system, whereas [non-EU spouses are not](http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/reports/the-minimum-income-requirement-for-non-eea-family-members-in-the-uk-2/).
1.10.4.1.3.1. Con: EU-originating benefit tourism was not one of the major factors in the Brexit referendum, and so is largely incidental to this debate.
1.10.4.1.3.1.1. Con: Benefit tourism is important to the electorate, and therefore plays an important part in the publics decision to Leave/Remain. [76%](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10570559/The-public-crave-a-crackdown-on-welfare-tourism.-But-are-they-deluded.html) said they would support a two year benefits ban for immigrants \(2014\).
1.10.4.1.4. Pro: EU rules allow the UK to require migrants to become [self-sufficient within 3 months](http://www.eearegulations.co.uk/CitizensRightsDirective/ByPage/Article_07) of arriving \(excluding students and families\), but the [UK does not](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/richard-bird/immigration-blame-the-uk-_b_13120104.html) register migrants as they arrive and as such has no way of knowing how long they have been in the UK.
1.10.4.1.4.1. Pro: There are no efforts to track or control this movement. The [Home Office has admitted](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10361971/Britain-admits-it-has-no-figures-on-EU-welfare-tourist-numbers.html) it does not even know how many EU citizens are in Britain and eligible for welfare.
1.10.4.1.5. Pro: The UK [could limit 'benefit tourism'](https://brexit853.wordpress.com/2016/09/27/powers-that-the-uk-has-failed-to-use-to-control-eu-freedom-of-movement-directive/) from EU countries if it desired to do so, by using [Article 7 of the Citizenship Directive](http://www.eearegulations.co.uk/CitizensRightsDirective/ByPage/Article_07).
1.10.4.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.10.4.1.3.1.
1.10.4.1.5.2. Con: There are many other reasons to exclude someone from coming to your country other than that they will be a burden on your state. Two reasons in particular would be if they were not a good cultural fit, or they posed a national security risk.
1.10.4.1.5.2.1. Con: Member States, like the UK, can restrict entry and residence of EU citizens on grounds of public policy or public security \([art 27 and further CD](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32004L0038)\). This is understood as 'genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society'. Although to be interpreted restrictively, based on the personal conduct of the individual, it is to be read in light of the national needs of the Member State. \(see cases 30/77[Bouchereau](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/showPdf.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30dd789656d3536448358ccef87255e02c57.e34KaxiLc3qMb40Rch0SaxyOa3j0?text=&docid=89572&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=233337) and 41/74 [Van Duyn](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61974CJ0041)\)
1.10.4.1.5.2.2. Con: [EU regulations](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/mar/29/eu-dangerous-criminals-allowed-free-entry-uk-vote-leave-claims) already allow countries to reject people with a criminal record.
1.10.4.1.5.2.2.1. Con: [According to the same source](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/mar/29/eu-dangerous-criminals-allowed-free-entry-uk-vote-leave-claims), the law states “previous criminal convictions shall not in themselves constitute grounds for taking such measures” \(i.e., for refusing entry to such a person\), adding extra standards for evaluating criminals on a case-by-case basis.
1.10.4.1.5.2.2.1.1. Con: This is a positive thing, as it gives choice and control to UK border staff. Either alternative \(no ability to stop criminals / no ability to accept criminals\) would be worse for the UK than the current situation: getting to decide itself.
1.10.4.1.5.2.2.2. Pro: Convicted criminals can be [excluded](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/mar/29/eu-dangerous-criminals-allowed-free-entry-uk-vote-leave-claims) on a case-by-case basis if they present “a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society”.
1.10.4.1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.4.1.4.
1.10.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.4.1.5.2.1.
1.10.4.3. Con: -> See 1.10.4.1.2.
1.10.4.4. Con: The number of Romanians and Bulgarians living in the UK [has increased by over 80% since 2014](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/964654/Romanians-UK-immigration-levels-2018-EU-Blair-Poles-immigrants) to over 400,000 as a result of EU open border immigration laws. This is unprecedented, was not anticipated \(even Nigel farage underestimated the numbers that would come\) and would not have happened had the UK had full control of immigration.
1.10.4.4.1. Con: It was consecutive UK governments who decided not to restrict residency rights without proof of sustainable work of EU immigrants. The EU is not responsible for the UK lack of regulations. Immigrants who work and pay taxes however contribute hugely to the UK economy.
1.10.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.10.4.1.5.2.2.
1.10.4.6. Pro: The UK [already](http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=460) has the [ability](http://ukandeu.ac.uk/fact-figures/what-is-freedom-of-movement/) to control immigration. It has chosen not to. The fact that there is no enforcement of these rules in the UK is not the fault of of the EU.
1.10.4.6.1. Pro: The UK government has failed to implement the measures allowed by the EU, when it could have. Brexit will enable it to continue to fail to do so. [Farage Admits UK could have controlled EU immigration.](https://twitter.com/Femi_Sorry/status/938456838940643332)
1.10.4.6.2. Pro: The UK previously chose to let in higher numbers of EU migrants than they had to, as the result of their own immigration policy.
1.10.4.6.2.1. Pro: The UK was [one of only three](https://theconversation.com/the-huge-political-cost-of-blairs-decision-to-allow-eastern-european-migrants-unfettered-access-to-britain-66077) EU member states, alongside Sweden and Ireland, to open its labour market to the new 2004 Eastern European EU citizens \(EU10, including the A8\) immediately.
1.10.4.6.2.1.1. Pro: [EU rules allowed](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpb21/reports/HomeOffice25_03.pdf) existing member states 2+3+2 years of their own restrictions, and to suspend free movement of workers if they experienced or anticipated serious disturbances to their labour market.
1.10.4.6.2.2. Pro: Opening borders to eastern european migrants was in keeping with Labours 1997–2010 immigration policies, which had always focused on [expanding immigration and removing restrictions](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369183X.2015.1045711?journalCode=cjms20), to encourage the economic benefits of increased migration.
1.10.4.6.2.2.1. Pro: Under Blair’s Labour government, Britain’s economic immigration policy went from a highly restrictive approach to [one of the most expansive in Europe](https://theconversation.com/how-new-labour-made-britain-into-a-migration-state-85472). It resulted in Immigration five times higher than under the previous government.
1.10.4.6.2.3. Pro: [Tony Blair made a 2004 deal](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1458492/Revealed-Blair-made-deal-with-Romanian-PM-to-let-in-migrants.html) with Romanian prime minister Adrian Nastase [accepting more migrants](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/964654/Romanians-UK-immigration-levels-2018-EU-Blair-Poles-immigrants) in order to manipulate Asylum application figures to make good on earlier promises, rather than trying to resolve the problem properly.
1.10.4.6.2.3.1. Con: Blair's deal was short lived, and it was reversed by the UK government in [2006](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/25/immigrationandpublicservices.eu). As a consequence of Romania then joining the EU and EU migration law, the UK government lost the power to restrict migration from Romania from [2014](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25565302), tying the hands of future UK governments who were then unable to change it despite the [democratic desire to do so](http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-of-concern/). This illustrates the fundamentally undemocratic way the EU project operates.
1.10.4.6.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.10.4.1.4.
1.10.4.6.3. Pro: Other EU nations like Austria currently [restrict EU migrants](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-austria#visas-and-residency) using existing EU laws. Theresa May merely chose not to do so when she was Home Secretary. Brexit was never necessary to restrict migration from the EU.
1.10.4.6.3.1. Con: Austria's laws only restrict EU migrants that aren't working/studying/able to support themselves. The vast majority of EU migrants to the UK are employed, and so these laws would do next to nothing to restrict migration from the EU. Therefore Brexit is absolutely necessary to restrict EU migration.
1.10.4.6.3.1.1. Con: There is no consensus between Leave voters as to what controls on immigration should be put in place. Some insist that immigration was never the issue, some want only to restrict the unemployed being a burden on the country, others go much further insisting that we have "No room". If migrants are working then they are contributing to British society and paying towards new schools, housing, the NHS, etc.
1.10.5. Pro: The possibility that Turkey, an EU candidate country that borders war-torn Syria and has a large population, may join the EU is a major [concern](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/world/europe/britain-brexit-turkey-eu.html) to many British Eurosceptics.
1.10.5.1. Con: The reasons why Eurosceptics object to Turkish EU membership are largely unjustified and based on racial fears. Even if the UK should be allowed to regulate its own immigration policy, these would be illegitimate reasons to exclude Turkey.
1.10.5.1.1. Con: Turkish President Erdogan's [purge on media](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2018/07/erdogan-media-turks-care-180701092502264.html) and the [2017 referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2017) granting him further control over government institutions are not compatible with EU democratic standards and anti-corruption efforts.
1.10.5.2. Con: The EU is [unlikely](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-turkey-eu-factbox/factbox-turkeys-collapsing-eu-membership-bid-idUSKCN1BF1TH) to admit Turkey under its current political [situation](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34503388) with or without the UK. Moreover, the UK \(while historically in favor of Turkey's accession\) would [probably](http://www.dw.com/en/turkey-eu-relations-which-countries-are-for-or-against-turkish-accession/a-40381533) be against it if it remains and would have [veto](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/penny-mordaunt-andrew-marr-uk-veto-tory-minister-accused-of-flat-out-lying-over-turkey-joining-the-a7041956.html) power over its accession.
1.10.6. Con: [The majority](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40015269) of immigration to the UK comes from non-EU countries, which the UK can already control.
1.10.6.1. Con: The EU accounts for less than 10% of the world's population, therefore it is inappropriate for it to account for over 40% of UK migrants.
1.10.6.1.1. Con: It is only natural for neighboring countries to account for more migrants, especially when it's easier.
1.10.6.1.2. Con: This is a very simplistic statistic that doesn't address real world issues and circumstances. It's far less likely for people from African nations to even be able to afford to even come to Britain whilst people from South America are far more likely to migrate to the USA due to geography.
1.10.6.2. Pro: UK Immigration statistics [categorize](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/04/overseas-students-migrants-universities-brexit) overseas students as migrants, but as many of these students will subsequently leave the UK, this overly inflates migrant numbers.
1.10.6.2.1. Con: The [ONS found that](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/whatshappeningwithinternationalstudentmigration/2017-08-24) many people do not simply immigrate for study and leave afterwards; their lives are more complex – some people arrive on a work visa and legitimately change to a study visa and vice versa.
1.10.6.3. Con: The UK is still unable to control the immigration from the EU. Even if they are not the largest fraction of immigrants, the lack of control still undermines the UK's ability to control its borders.
1.10.6.3.1. Con: Britain has chosen in the past not to implement EU laws to restrict unemployed migrants. Brexit was never necessary to reduce the number of migrants coming here. This is how Austria, another EU nation, [restricts](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-austria#visas-and-residency) migrants from other countries including Britain.
1.10.6.3.2. Con: Many Leave voters have no intention of "controlling borders" and thus restrict immigration when it comes down to the complex issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the ROI. Ireland and the EU also has the [right](https://jonworth.eu/england-to-wave-goodbye-to-northern-ireland-to-secure-its-hard-brexit/) to restrict immigrants moving through the UK to get into the EU.
1.10.6.3.2.1. Con: A soft border between NI and ROI following Brexit would allow [any EU national](http://www.irishnews.com/news/brexit/2017/08/16/news/eu-citizens-to-be-able-to-cross-border-without-immigration-checks-1112608/) to travel to ROI and simply cross the border into UK territory without having to be a UK citizen.
1.10.6.3.3. Con: -> See 1.10.4.
1.10.7. Pro: Outside the EU, the UK cannot be subjected to forced immigration like the "[2015 European Agenda on Migration](https://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-to-end-mandatory-refugee-relocation-for-now/)" which obliges member countries to fulfil quotas for asylum seekers.
1.10.7.1. Con: The UK, Ireland and Denmark [have opt-outs](http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.com/2015/05/can-uk-opt-out-of-mandatory-eu-refugee.html?m=1) from parts of EU justice and home affairs \(JHA\) policy. They could use those opt-outs to avoid the European Agenda on Migrations mandatory burden-sharing, if they wanted to.
1.10.7.2. Con: Outside of the EU, the UK will have to enter into bilateral and multilateral discussions and agreements on refugee crises as a single entity. As such, it will wield a lot less authority at the table than either those belonging to multilateral negotiating groups such as the EU, or the big trading partners of those groups. It's more likely to have a lot less control or options, and to find itself pushed around by bigger fish on the global stage.
1.10.8. Pro: If the UK stayed in the EU and did not comply with refugee quotas it could be subject to legal proceedings \(infringement procedures\). This is exactly what has happened to [Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eu-poland-hungary-czech-republic-refugee-crisis-handle-legal-proceeding-lawsuit-european-commission-a7789161.html)
1.10.8.1. Con: Britain has taken [far fewer](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/26/europeans-back-allocating-asylum-seekers-proportionally-study-finds) refugees proportionally than most other EU nations, despite the [majority](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/news/themes-in-the-spotlight/asylum2016) of them arriving from countries that we personally took direct military action against: Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Leaving the EU burdens other nations with a problem that Britain was involved in creating.
1.10.8.2. Con: Accepting refugees from war torn countries is a small price to pay for wider political stability and to demonstrate that Britain can act responsibly as a progressive first world nation on an international level.
1.10.8.3. Con: The UK has a moral duty to take in refugees, and legal proceedings only make us stick to what we've already agreed too.
1.10.9. Con: By leaving the EU, the UK has to sign free trade deals with other nations, many of whom may require increased freedom of movement of people, which could potentially offset any decreased immigration from the EU.
1.10.9.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.1.1.
1.10.9.2. Pro: Australia has [said](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-australia-india-tell-uk-relax-immigration-rules-free-trade-deal-eu-visa-restrictions-a7540036.html) that it wants to liberalise immigration visa policies for Australians wanting to come to the UK.
1.10.9.3. Con: This becomes a matter that can then be controlled by the UK government and renegotiated as necessary, and so is a desirable outcome for those who voted to regain control of the UK's borders.
1.10.9.4. Con: It is highly unlikely any liberalisation of visas will be as expansive as the EU's free movement of people policies.
1.10.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.1.
1.10.10. Con: -> See 1.1.10.2.1.
1.10.11. Con: The free movement of people between the UK and the rest of the EU is actually economically beneficial for the UK.
1.10.11.1. Pro: The USA is commonly called the most economically powerful country in the world, and has the [highest number of migrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_immigrant_population) \(46 million\).
1.10.11.1.1. Con: Correlation does not necessarily mean causation - immigration might not be a factor causing success, but a reaction to success.
1.10.11.1.1.1. Pro: Immigrants naturally flock away from less successful countries towards more successful countries.
1.10.11.1.2. Pro: A survey of leading economists shows a consensus behind the view that high-skilled immigration makes the average American better off. A survey of the same economists also shows strong support behind the notion that low-skilled [immigration makes the average American better off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States#Economic).
1.10.11.1.2.1. Con: The predictions of "economists" in general are not credible. Specific economists with demonstrable track records of predictive success may be more credible.
1.10.11.1.2.1.1. Pro: The predictions and views of surveyed economists are so often [misleading or plain wrong.](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/02/economic-forecasting-flawed-science-data)
1.10.11.1.2.1.2. Pro: [Economics is not a science](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/10390981/Time-to-stop-this-pretence-economics-is-not-science.html) or -at least- economists are not scientists.
1.10.11.1.2.1.3. Pro: Economists have been found guilty of [groupthink, guided by political ends and using error-prone gravity modelling](https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2017/jan/08/economic-forecasts-hardwired-get-things-wrong).
1.10.11.1.3. Pro: America, the promised land, [was built](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigrants-make-america-great-because-immigrants-made_us_5928a40ce4b08861ed0cc96d) on the backs of immigrants. It's melting pot of migrants is a huge part of it's conception, history, and success.
1.10.11.1.3.1. Pro: Because the United States is a settler colonial society, the vast majority of Americans, with the exception of Native Americans, [can trace their ancestry to immigrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States) from other nations.
1.10.11.1.4. Pro: The other countries with next highest immigration levels are also all economically strong countries:  Germany \(12m\), Russia \(11m\), Saudi Arabia \(10m\), UK \(8m\).
1.10.11.1.4.1. Con: The economies of Russia and Saudi Arabia are massively reliant on oil and natural gas, and so in addition to this being something unattributable to migration, the lack of diversification makes the economies prone to economic shock and underlying strength may be illusory.
1.10.11.1.4.2. Pro: Germany, UK, and Russia are in the [top 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_and_social_rankings_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe) economies in Europe, by nominal and PPP GDP.
1.10.11.1.4.2.1. Con: Russia is [46th](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_and_social_rankings_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe) out of 50 European countries by measure of GDP growth rate, and [31st](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_and_social_rankings_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe) out of 50 by GDP per capita.
1.10.11.1.4.3. Pro: The Saudi economy is the [largest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Saudi_Arabia) in the Arab world.
1.10.11.1.5. Con: The USA does not have free movement of people with the EU, indicating free movement with  the EU is in no way a prerequisite for a country to be economically  powerful.
1.10.11.2. Con: The free movement of people may have been economically beneficial for the UK in the past, however the law of diminishing returns suggests that the economic benefits are being increasingly eroded by the associated societal costs, as negative externalities caused by population pressures mount. This is what has happened in the UK.
1.10.11.2.1. Pro: Immigration has been the [largest driver](https://fullfact.org/health/increasing-population-households/) of the increasing population, according to the Office for National Statistics.
1.10.11.2.2. Pro: In 2010, a cross-party group including MPs, poverty experts, economic historians, and the former Archbishop of Canterbury issued a [“Declaration on Population”](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/09/is-britain-full-home-truths-about-population-panic). It warned that a UK population of 70 million – which will arrive about 2030, based on current trends – “would be seriously damaging to the future harmony of our society.”
1.10.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.
1.10.11.4. Con: -> See 1.6.2.1.
1.10.11.5. Con: Whether or not it is beneficial in an economic sense does not affect whether or not the UK should have the right to control it.
1.10.11.6. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.4.
1.10.11.7. Pro: Engineered austerity, not immigration, is behind a lack of resources.
1.10.12. Con: Leaving will bring the migrant crisis to Britain’s doorstep. Border controls from the Continent will [move from Calais in France to Dover in UK](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2016/04/28/brexit-and-the-myth-of-european-security-would-the-uk-leaving-th/), shifting the burden of processing large numbers of migrants to Britain.
1.10.12.1. Con: The above claim is untrue. The Dover/Calais border is governed by the Le Touquet treaty between France and the UK and has [nothing to do with the EU](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/17/may-and-macron-to-sign-new-calais-border-treaty). Brexit, hard or otherwise, has no legal effect on it.
1.11. Pro: A hard Brexit may negatively affect the National Health Service.
1.11.1. Con: [£20 billion has been pledged to NHS](http://www.itv.com/news/2018-06-16/nhs-to-receive-20bn-boost-by-2024-partly-funded-by-brexit-dividend-says-may/) by 2024, funded by money saved from the EU membership.
1.11.1.1. Con: FullFact suggest that [none of the £20 billion Brexit dividend will actually come from Brexit savings](https://fullfact.org/europe/does-brexit-dividend-exist/).
1.11.1.2. Pro: The Brexit dividend will pay the [equivalent of £384 million a week](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/975322/brexit-news-nhs-funding-600-million-week-victory-leave-european-union), more than the [£350 million promised by Vote Leave](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/brexit-latest-nhs-england-350-million-per-week-pledge-eu-simon-stevens-brussels-a8043191.html).
1.11.1.2.1. Con: The EU membership cost to Britain is £13.1bn a year, or [approximately](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/) £251m a week. £4.5bn of that fee covers money paid back to Britain for farming subsidies, science research, regeneration grants, etc. Researchers suggest that the loss of trade through a No-Deal Brexit will [cost far more](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-no-trade-deal-with-eu-cost-58-billion-annually-customs-union-tariffs-a8251581.html) than the EU membership fee itself, a total of £58bn a year.
1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.3.
1.11.3. Pro: Theresa May has [refused](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-nhs-us-trade-deal-talks-privatisation-healthcare-trump-a8198871.html) to rule out when asked in Parliament if the NHS would be part of any trade deal discussions with America.
1.11.4. Pro: A likely period of economic harm after Brexit may be enough to do permanent damage to the already struggling NHS as well as other public services as Government tax revenues would be hit.
1.11.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.
1.11.5. Con: A clean Brexit would enable the UK to move away from applying competition law to the NHS, something which is currently more difficult due to EU regulations \([pg. 4](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/field/field_publication_file/procurement-competition-rules-kings-fund-mar-2015.pdf)\).
1.11.5.1. Pro: While the UK itself has competition law that applies to the NHS this [cannot be reformed](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/brexit-relationship-eu-shape-nhs#procurement-and-competition) as it is echoed by European regulations. This could be changed after Brexit.
1.11.5.2. Pro: Competition law [has prevented](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/15/competition-killing-nhs-bournemouth-poole) the NHS from enacting mergers that could improve care and reduce costs.
1.11.5.3. Pro: Competition law has allowed private health providers to [challenge](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/15/competition-killing-nhs-bournemouth-poole) the NHS for failure to refer services, creating expensive legal fees. This risks clinicians within the NHS experiencing a "[chilling effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect)" whereby they are discouraged from referring patients to public providers, over private ones, even when it is the best clinical decision.
1.11.5.4. Con: EU competition law only applies to 'undertakings'. When acting in a way connected with 'the exercise of the powers of a public authority', or providing services based on solidarity, an entity is not an undertaking. The NHS therefore does not have to qualify as an 'undertaking' for the purpose of EU competition law. \([Case CJEU: Wouters v Algemene Raad van de Nederlandsche Orde van Advocaten, , 2002, paragraph 57](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30ddb41c0a5e81dc4ed98c5ed39e5d840d7a.e34KaxiLc3qMb40Rch0SaxyNchb0?text=&docid=46722&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=239325)\)
1.11.5.4.1. Pro: Scotland and Wales essentially avoid competition law by not treating health services as commercial agreements, but rather as something provided as a public service. This is consistent with the EU regulations and could be followed throughout the UK without Brexit \(Collins, B. 2015 [pg. 5](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/field/field_publication_file/procurement-competition-rules-kings-fund-mar-2015.pdf)\)
1.11.6. Con: A hard Brexit could improve the quality of service provision and medical staff.
1.11.6.1. Pro: The EU working time directive, which restricts the amount of work a week to 48 hours, has had significant benefits for healthcare staff but it is also inflexible. This inflexibility has a [negative effect](https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/about-the-rcs/government-relations-and-consultation/working-time-directive-taskforce/) on the training of doctors.
1.11.6.1.1. Con: The minor changes required to make the working time directive more flexible for training are already being [considered by EU bodies](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-flexibility-for-nhs-doctors-under-european-working-time-directive) in coordination with UK authorities. Such reforms that are beneficial to the UK can take place within the EU.
1.11.6.2. Pro: After Brexit, the General Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council could require [competency tests](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/brexit-relationship-eu-shape-nhs#regulation-of-life-sciences-and-health-care) for practitioners who trained in the EU. This is relevant as there is considerable variation in the way doctors are trained across Europe
1.11.6.2.1. Pro: Oncologists in the UK are trained in both radiation and chemotherapy, whereas in some parts of Europe they may focus on one \(House of Commons [pg. 25](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmhealth/640/640.pdf)\)
1.11.6.3. Con: After Brexit UK doctors, and by extension their patients, will be unable to access the [European Reference Networks](https://ec.europa.eu/health/ern/overview_en). These networks bring together experts from around Europe to assist in caring for patients with rare diseases. This loss will reduce the quality of care these people receive.
1.11.6.4. Con: The [Special EU Programmes Body](https://www.seupb.eu/iva-overview) funds specific initiatives in Northern Ireland that tackle the problems caused by having a border. [These include](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/brexit-relationship-eu-shape-nhs#the-regulation-of-workers) initiatives aimed at supporting children with mental health needs and community care. The vast majority of this funding comes from the EU.
1.11.7. Pro: Brexit will interfere with the supply of goods for the NHS.
1.11.7.1. Pro: Continued EU membership [guarantees](https://news.sky.com/story/pharmacists-preparing-to-stockpile-medicines-and-medical-supplies-for-no-deal-brexit-11441089) the long term security of medicines.
1.11.7.2. Pro: The depreciation of the Pound against the Euro has already cost the NHS [considerably](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2018/01/nhs-already-crisis-brexit-could-finish-it) as at least half of the products used come from overseas. It is [likely](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/pound-sterling-latest-updates-price-value-brexit-currency-dollar-amundi-fund-manager-a8217381.html) that a hard Brexit would cause a further depreciation of the value of the Pound.
1.11.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.6.
1.11.7.3. Pro: Many goods supplied to the NHS have complex supply chains. [For example](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/brexit-relationship-eu-shape-nhs#customs-and-trade), the main supplier of NHS needles produces them in Plymouth but distributes them from Belgium. A hard Brexit will interrupt this movement of products and increase their cost.
1.11.7.4. Pro: Some medical goods, such as radioisotopes and a number of biological agents, have a shelf-life that's [measured in hours](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/brexit-relationship-eu-shape-nhs#medical-radioisotopes). Any delay at customs could be detrimental.
1.11.7.4.1. Con: The UK government would unquestionably put in place arrangements to prevent customs delay on inward movement of such goods.
1.11.7.5. Pro: Currently 'parallel trade', which involves the NHS buying medicines that are sold more cheaply in European countries, is estimated to save more than [£100 million](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/brexit-relationship-eu-shape-nhs#finding-a-system-that-works-for-medicines) a year.
1.11.7.5.1. Con: This is less than 0.1% of the NHS budget, and can probably be recovered by more effective price negotiation by the NHS.
1.11.7.5.2. Con: This may be more than offset by increases in trade with [other countries that can supply high quality cheap medicines, such as India.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry_in_India)
1.11.7.5.2.1. Pro: The supply of high quality medicine from India would make the UK a better place.
1.11.7.5.2.1.1. Pro: It would [significantly alleviate financial pressures on the NHS](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/rising-cost-medicines-nhs), meaning more money that the NHS can allocate to making the UK a healthier country.
1.11.7.5.2.1.2. Pro: Resultant over the counter \(OTC\) medicine price decreases would lead to a small but [measurable](https://www.statista.com/statistics/415963/over-the-counter-otc-medicine-breakdown-of-sales-in-great-britain/) increase in the amount that British people have in their pocket to do with what they will.
1.11.8. Pro: A large number of British pensioners are able to live in Europe and receive healthcare from European systems because of Britain's membership of the EU. If the UK were to leave, some of these pensioners would have to return, costing the NHS \(on net\) approximately [half a billion pounds](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/news-item/nhs-could-face-bill-of-over-half-a-billion-pounds-from-brexit).
1.11.8.1. Con: The estimate of increased costs is highly derived and unclear if it is true or not. The report only considers the cost to the NHS of pensioners returning to the UK, getting older and using more services. It does not consider the economic benefit of those pensioners spending their money locally which will bolster UK tax revenue, rather than that of Spain or France.
1.11.8.2. Con: That the NHS is so much less efficient than the health services of other EU countries is a reason for NHS reform, not a reason not to leave the EU.
1.11.8.3. Con: In the grand scheme of things, half a billion pounds is not very much \(it would fund the NHS for around 1.5 days, based on a yearly budget of [£116 billion](https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/overview.aspx)\).
1.11.9. Con: Currently new medicines used in the UK need to be approved by the European Medical Authority. After Brexit the equivalent UK body could be [more flexible](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/brexit-relationship-eu-shape-nhs#finding-a-system-that-works-for-medicines) and fast-track the approval of medicines, which had already been approved by other regulators \(including the European and American Authorities\).
1.11.9.1. Con: That is an extremely dangerous practice. Fast tracking medicines without proper approval systems will lead to mistakes being made. The EU has a lengthy approval process to protect peoples health from profit hungry pharmaceutical companies.
1.11.10. Pro: When the UK tightened its immigration policy for non-EU citizens this had a [negative effect](https://fullfact.org/immigration/immigration-and-nhs-staff/) on recruitment of hospital staff. It is likely a restriction on EU immigrants would have the same effect.
1.11.10.1. Pro: About [10% of doctors](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40015269) come from the EU, leaving this workforce is particularly vulnerable to reductions in immigration.
1.11.10.1.1. Con: The UK has [just increased immigration quotas](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/14/sajid-javid-confirms-cap-on-foreign-doctors-and-nurses-will-be-lifted) for doctors and nurses from non-EU countries showing that it is not necessary to have completely unfettered free movement in order to effect adequate NHS recruitment from other countries.
1.11.10.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.10.4.6.3.
1.11.10.1.2. Pro: Almost a third of newly-registered nurses in the UK had [trained in the EEA](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/news-item/nhs-could-face-bill-of-over-half-a-billion-pounds-from-brexit). \(2016\)
1.11.10.2. Con: -> See 1.11.10.1.1.
1.11.10.3. Pro: There has already been [a 96% reduction](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-40248366) in nursing applicants from EU countries since the referendum.
1.11.10.3.1. Con: There have recently been [strict new English proficiency tests](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jun/24/english-speaking-ovserseas-nurses-fail-nhs-too-tough-language-test) that are preventing many people being eligible to apply for nursing positions, and so it is not clear whether the referendum has had a significant impact on nursing applications.
1.11.10.4. Con: The immigration policy won't be applying to just the eu. The whole point is we have one policy applied to the whole world encouraging those with skills to come here. Hospital staff constitute those with skills and thus there will be allowances for those coming here to fill those jobs. Infact instead of non eu citizens who could work as hospital staff being blocked because numbers of internal non skilled eu immigrants were too high and thus external skilled quotas had to be cut.
1.11.10.5. Con: EU immigrants make up [only 5% of NHS staff](https://fullfact.org/immigration/immigration-and-nhs-staff/), therefore the effect will not be so pronounced.
1.11.10.5.1. Con: The impact of losing 5% of NHS staff will be more pronounced as the system is already under the strain of staff shortages. [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/13/nhs-faces-acute-and-growing-staffing-shortage-warns-agency)
1.11.10.5.2. Con: The "Hostile environment" towards immigrants created by Theresa May and compounded by Brexit will not only make NHS recruitment much more difficult from the EU, but for medical staff from outside the EU too.
1.11.10.5.2.1. Con: The 'Hostile Environment' refers ONLY to illegal immigrants not to legal ones.["We’re going to give illegal migrants a really hostile reception".](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9291483/Theresa-May-interview-Were-going-to-give-illegal-migrants-a-really-hostile-reception.html)
1.11.10.5.2.1.1. Con: That was the stated goal, but it worked out that lots of legal immigrants were [targeted](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43782241) too.
1.11.10.5.3. Con: The NHS is one of the largest employers in the world employing just over a million "full time equivalent" posts - "only" 5% is roughly 50,000 FTEs - more than we're already short by for nurses e.g. [40,000 nurse FTEs.](https://fullfact.org/health/are-we-short-40000-nurses/)
1.11.11. Con: There are already many good, publicly-funded healthcare systems which operate outside the EU e.g. Canada, Singapore, Japan, Norway. There is no innate reason that a post-hard-Brexit NHS could not be maintained at the current standard or improved by this or subsequent governments, if they make good decisions and provide sufficient funding. The election of such a government is a matter for the UK electorate.
1.11.12. Pro: The Caribbean island of Anguilla is a British Overseas Territory. It [relies heavily](http://westindiacommittee.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/The-White-Paper-on-Anguilla-and-Brexit.pdf) on access to the neighbouring island of St Maarten, which is a French territory and therefore in the EU, especially for medical care. The islanders' access to healthcare will be devastated in the event of a Hard Brexit, as there are currently no backup plans.
1.12. Con: The supremacy of EU law impinges on Britain's ability to make laws to govern itself; by exiting the EU, Britain can make rules on any area it chooses.
1.12.1. Con: With the EU being our [largest trading partner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_United_Kingdom), we are likely to align our laws to make trading easier if we were outside it.  We are going to end up with most EU legislation being enacted, we will just be losing the ability to influence those laws.
1.12.2. Con: EU legislation around areas such as employment rights offers a framework of minimum standards to protect workers. Each EU member can improve on those standards through its own legislation. We already do so on matters such as [holiday pay](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-and-paid-holidays/#).
1.12.3. Con: The minimal amount of sovereignty Britain may win back from Europe is useless if it inhibits future governments from maintaining British prosperity. A Hard Brexit, with its economic and political consequences, calls this into question.
1.12.4. Con: Many of the EU laws and regulations supposedly imposed on the UK were heavily influenced by UK officials working in Whitehall and Brussels. The UK has [disproportionate influence](http://ukandeu.ac.uk/explainers/is-the-uk-marginalised-in-the-eu-2/) across a range of policy areas in the EU and has used this to establish common policies across the EU that benefit the UK.
1.12.4.1. Con: The problem is that once these laws and regulations are established, they are almost impossible to change as they require consensus across the EU. This means that a change in UK government cannot undo what was wanted by a previous government, undermining democracy.
1.12.5. Con: Leaving the EU will likely lead to an increase in the influence of actors other than the British public on UK law.
1.12.5.1. Pro: Multinational companies will be able to exert leverage on UK employment law by threatening to move jobs out of the UK, whereas they would be less able to use this negotiating tactic to influence EU-wide employment laws.
1.12.5.2. Pro: The UK will have to strike deals with both the EU and third countries, which will require it to make concessions. It will probably have to accept, to some extent, the laws of the EU, especially if it wants to trade. It may even have to accept some regulatory alignment with third countries. The ability to choose not to be subjected to those rules is limited by the power the UK has vis-à-vis other countries. The UK may have less power on its own than as part of the EU.
1.12.5.3. Con: Any marginal increase in external lobbying represents less of a problematic influence than that of the EU's direct sovereignty over UK institutions.
1.12.5.3.1. Pro: External lobbying only attempts to influence the UK, and does not have direct authority to mandate a change to UK law. Thus, the influence of lobbying is more easily resisted and less of a significant threat to sovereignty.
1.12.5.3.2. Con: This is an opinion, not a fact.
1.12.5.4. Pro: Some prospective trading partners prefer arbitration of agreements/treaties pertaining to trade to be conducted by [industry panels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor-state_dispute_settlement), not courts. This not only reduces transparency and therefore accountability, it also allows foreign private companies to sue the government for changing laws that they deem to be detrimental to their profits/competitiveness.
1.12.5.5. Pro: The UK government will still want to influence EU laws and regulations, but will do that by lobbying. This occurs mostly behind closed doors, and is therefore less transparent and accountable than having UK citizens in the European Parliament, and in various other positions in the EU.
1.12.6. Pro: A failure to leave the EU would likely force the UK into increased inclusion into EU initiatives such as the [Shenghen area](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/858815/Brexit-news-UK-Labour-Party-conference-EU-Jeremy-Corbyn-European-Union-video) \(free movement\), [the euro](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/19/please-vote-leave-on-thursday-because-well-never-get-this-chance/) \(currency\) and the "[EU army](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/879322/eu-army-latest-5-countries-refuse-sign-up-france-germany-defence-force)" initiative as examples. These initiatives would increase the UK's ties with the EU making leaving the EU in the future much more complicated.
1.12.7. Con: On the votes in the European Parliament, the majority agreed with the UK in [95% of cases](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-facts-behind-claims-uk-influence/). In 2%, the UK did not express an opinion.
1.12.8. Pro: The EU is a [neoliberal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-european-unions-neoliberal-dilemma-1507147154) institution. As part of it, Britain is unable to pursue [socialist economic policies](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2017/07/lexit-eu-neoliberal-project-so-lets-do-something-different-when-we-leave-it), even if it was democratically mandated.
1.12.8.1. Pro: The EU pursued [austerity policies](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/09/greece-debt-crisis-athens-accepts-harsh-austerity-as-bailout-deal-nears) in Greece, [against](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/19/greek-people-austerity-eu-greece-economic-crisis-democracy) the Greek people's wishes. This was made possible [by the ECB](https://www.politico.eu/article/greece-agrees-to-new-bailout-deal/), an EU institution.
1.12.8.2. Con: EU employment law provides some of the [strongest safeguards](https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/may/24/what-would-leaving-eu-mean--employment-rights) for workers in the world.
1.12.8.3. Con: The past six UK prime ministers \([Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#United_Kingdom), [Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#United_Kingdom), [Blair](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/aug/06/society.labour), [Brown](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/04/gordon-browns-legacy-rampant-neoliberalism), [Cameron](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/david-cameron-and-the-neoliberal-undercurrents-of-state-austerity/), and [May](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/theresa-may-tory-manifesto-2017-david-cameron-right-wing-social-care-a7743146.html)\) have run government's with neoliberal policies. The UK does not want to pursue socialists economic policies, so it's ability to do so has never actually come under consideration.
1.12.8.4. Con: The EU is only a sum of the wills of its member states. If the UK citizenry wants to make the EU have more left-wing or protectionist policies, they can vote that way such that their domestic government and EU representatives will advocate for them.
1.12.8.4.1. Con: Whilst it would be possible for a future UK Socialist government and Socialist MEPs to influence the EU, this alone would not be enough to make a significant difference.
1.12.8.4.1.1. Pro: The majority of the EU countries have centre-right or right leaning parties in government, and extreme nationalist and populist parties like AfD are gaining footholds all over Europe.
1.12.8.4.1.1.1. Con: Political trends are fluid. Sometimes there's an authoritarian trend, sometimes there's a democratic trend. The parent assumes that just because the atmosphere is such and such today it will stay just like that frozen in time.
1.12.8.5. Pro: The [ban on tariffs](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/sell-abroad/import-export/index_en.htm) means countries cannot pursue protectionist economic policies to ensure domestic industries survive.
1.12.8.5.1. Con: The single market removes tariffs for its members, which is possible because the single market created a level playing field with regulations \(e.g. on labour standards and the environment\). There still are protective tariffs for exports originating from outside the EU, where standards, labour practices and environmental rules are different, which would give those countries a competitive advantage compared to EU countries \(cheap labour creates cheap products\).
1.12.8.5.2. Con: The UK does not like protective measures. It [rejected](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tata-steel-uk-government-accused-of-failing-to-protect-british-workers-by-blocking-eu-plans-to-allow-a6962446.html) the option to put tariffs on steel to protect the domestic steel industry, even when the EU proposed it.
1.12.8.6. Con: EU membership hasn't prevented Sweden and Denmark's strong workers' rights, nor the Universal Basic Income in Finland.
1.12.9. Pro: EU laws [have supremacy](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-law-and-uk/) over the National laws of the UK.
1.12.9.1. Con: True, but as a large and influential EU member state, UK has a big say in the laws that apply EU-wide.
1.12.9.2. Con: All supranational laws override national laws. International laws have to override national laws in order to be effective, otherwise governments that break international law can just point to their own national laws and say they acted legally deeming international laws useless.
1.12.9.2.1. Con: Much of international law is consent-based governance. This means that a state member is not obliged to abide by this type of international law, [unless it has expressly consented](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law) to a particular course of conduct, usually through [ratification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification) \(making international law/agreements into national law\).
1.12.9.3. Con: Much like in the US Federal laws override state laws. Or UK laws override local council laws.
1.12.10. Pro: Less than 15% of Britain’s GDP represents trade with the EU yet the EU institution's [regulations](http://www.betteroffout.net/the-case/10-eu-myths-about-withdrawl/) affect 100% of the economy.
1.12.10.1. Con: The UK trades with non EU countries through the EU. The EU has trade deals with dozens of countries and is constantly negotiating and signing new ones. This means the EU dependent trade is 100% of British trade.
1.12.10.2. Con: EU institutions only have the right to legislate in certain areas of the economy. The majority of economic decisions concerning member states are made by their respective national governments. Not even fully independent national governments like that of the USA are not able to affect 100% of their economy throught their decisions.
1.12.10.3. Con: Clean beaches have no impact on the UK’s trade with the EU, [yet EU environmental regulations have forced the UK government to clean our beaches](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/23/uk-bathing-water-ranks-next-from-last-eu-beach-table). Without the EU law, our beaches may have remained unclean. EU law requires governments to clean up their act.
1.12.10.4. Con: This is misleading. 15% of GDP is a massive amount, and [in 2015](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7851), 44% of the UK's goods and services were exported to the EU, while 53% of our imports came to the UK from the EU. No country's economy will ever be 100% dependent on trade, which is what the claim seems to fallaciously presume.
1.12.10.4.1. Con: This is misleading. A hard Brexit won't abolish all trade with the EU. At worst it will cause a modest dip, whereas the above claim seeks to scare people into thinking 15% of the economy is in serious jeopardy.
1.12.10.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.2.1.1.
1.12.11. Con: The extra layer of jurisdiction means that UK citizens can appeal to a higher court if they feel domestic law does not implement the rights of citizens that are described in EU law correctly, such as [equal pay](http://www.equalpayportal.co.uk/the-law/).
1.12.11.1. Con: The ECJ takes a purposive approach to interpreting EU regulation that expands its authority rather than respecting member states' sovereignty [\(Alter, p. 656\)](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3083&context=faculty_scholarship).
1.12.12. Con: Brexit legislation has weakened parliamentary sovereignty. Government ministers can amend or repeal legislation without the need for parliamentary scrutiny. [\("Henry VIII laws"\)](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2016/11/30/rights-for-the-chop-how-a-henry-viii-clause-in-the-great-repeal-bill-will-undermine-democracy/)
1.12.13. Con: Today, the British government remains solely responsible for the overwhelming majority of policy actions that matter to voters, such as [health, welfare, pensions, border security, defense, and monetary policy](https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/publications/research/2016-05-09-britain-eu-sovereignty-myth-niblett.pdf).
1.12.14. Con: The United Kingdom controls more than 98 per cent of its public expenditure. \(Niblett, 2016, [pg. 1](https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/publications/research/2016-05-09-britain-eu-sovereignty-myth-niblett.pdf)\).
1.12.15. Pro: The EU consists of member states that often have conflicting interests with clear winners and losers in any given piece of legislation, regulation, etc. It is better for nation states to control their own destinies.
1.12.15.1. Con: EU legislation undergoes fierce bargaining and is a result of compromise more often than not. In most cases member states ask for something in return in order to agree with some legislation.
1.12.15.2. Con: Decision making on a clearly national basis wouldn't avoid competition between national interests, and would facilitate zero sum situations as bigger nations would have no institutional checks on their power. This would only deprive EU nations of the platform and means to negotiate their differences in a peacefull, effective and mutually beneficial way.
1.12.15.3. Con: No nation state controls its own destiny in an[intensely globalized](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/03/trump-tariff-europe/555146/) world. [Giant players on the global stage](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/15/these-25-companies-are-more-powerful-than-many-countries-multinational-corporate-wealth-power/) \(e.g. Exxon-Mobil, Microsoft, General Electric\), [manipulate national politics](http://www.transparency.org.uk/our-work/uk-corruption/lobbying/#.WrVYhpdpHtQ), preferring smaller, weaker states \(less likely to regulate and tax them\). The British electorate's interests are low priority for them, as opinions are easily manipulated via the popular press. Multilateral Organisations allow national governments to collaborate and retain power to act in the people's interests.
1.12.15.4. Con: Inside or outside of the EU, Britain is still beholden to the same tides of international politics and economics \(which are outside of the control of any one state\) that drive the rules and policies of individual states. As an EU member, Britain wields far more power and authority to deal with trans-national players \(e.g. corporations and their lobbyists, rebel groups, cross-border rogue states etc\) and navigate these tides than if it stands alone.
1.12.15.4.1. Pro: No trade agreement exists that does not have an arbitrator that forces changes of laws in the participating countries. Even falling back to World Trade Organisation would mean other countries have effects on our laws.
1.12.15.5. Pro: It’s easier to navigate outside pressures \(big corporations, other states, etc.\) if you are not limited by a supra structure such as the EU. Being free to make your own choices does not mean you’re alone or weak — there’s much space for alliances with other nations, in bilateral agreements and such.
1.12.15.6. Pro: Even big corporations are bound by law, wether it be national or international, thus ways remain to limit their capacity for interference in national politics.
1.12.15.7. Pro: The EU itself lacks transparency and is very much affected by [lobbying](https://lobbyfacts.eu/charts-graphs) from big corporations. It is not an exaggeration to say that there is even less control from the people in this instance than there would be were the national state the only institution to be considered, in the absence of the EU.
1.12.16. Con: -> See 1.12.15.4.
1.13. Pro: The UK leaving the EU harms the EU and wider Europe.
1.13.1. Con: The harming of the EU will provide impetus for the EU to seek to resume negotiations and find a better compromise, and the UK rejoining the EU would prevent this from happening.
1.13.2. Con: The EU is a barrier to global free trade, which is against both its long term interests and those of wider Europe. The UK is a champion of free trading and a hard brexit will give the UK the opportunity to lead by example to the benefit of all.
1.13.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.2.
1.13.3. Pro: Brexit strengthens [Eurosceptic parties](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/24/european-far-right-hails-britains-brexit-vote-marine-le-pen) throughout Europe \(making other exit votes more likely\), posing an existential threat to the EU.
1.13.3.1. Con: [Approval](https://qz.com/1153966/britain-rejected-the-eu-and-the-eu-is-loving-its-new-life/) of the EU has gone up amongst the citizens of Germany, Hungary, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and France since the referendum.
1.13.3.1.1. Pro: Even Italy's eurosceptic 5-Star Movement, which leads opinion polls ahead of the upcoming election, has [abandoned](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-election-5star/italys-5-star-presents-election-program-with-no-euro-referendum-idUSKBN1FB1LM) its plans for a referendum on membership in the eurozone.
1.13.3.1.2. Con: This is an immediate impact due to the uncertainty of Brexit. Even if the UK is mildly successful this will likely change.
1.13.3.1.3. Pro: [Eurobarometer 88](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/Survey/getSurveyDetail/instruments/STANDARD/surveyKy/2143) \(p. 15\) confirms an improving overall image of the EU since the Brexit referendum in 2016.
1.13.3.1.4. Con: Brexit, as a symbol of a populist uprising agains the globalist order, has emboldened actors \(such as Hungarian Prime Minister [Viktor Orbán](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/a3jmba/trumps-victory-and-brexit-have-emboldened-hungarys-prime-minister-to-lead-a-populist-revolt-in-europe)\) who, while not wanting to leave the EU, seek to [undermine](http://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/viktor-orban-enemy-within-1-5300076) it.
1.13.3.1.4.1. Con: Orbán is the democratically elected and extremely popular prime minister of Hungary and should not be glibly maligned.
1.13.3.2. Con: The UK's fall from the fastest growing member of the G7 to the [slowest](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/uk-economy-lags-behind-g7-after-2017-growth-rate-cut-idUKKCN1G6110) will serve as a warning to other countries as to the effect of leaving the EU.
1.13.3.2.1. Con: The citizens of other countries aren’t stupid enough to look at short term economic blips but rather longer term trends.
1.13.3.2.2. Con: This only applies if Brexit is extremely harmful for the UK economy in the long term, a point which is [heavily contested](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/brexit-success-story-leaders-lost-plot-uk).
1.13.3.2.2.1. Con: The short term harm to the economy can also serve as a signal to the remaining members of the EU to not arrange for a referendum, especially as a short term economic hit would be attributed to the ruling party in question.
1.13.3.3. Pro: EU politicians [fear](http://www.cer.eu/insights/impact-brexit-eu) the greater German dominance that will emerge without the UK's check on German will.
1.13.3.3.1. Pro: Poland saw Brexit as negative, largely because the UK acted as a [counterweight](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-mourns-brexit/) to the eurozone countries \(particularly Germany\) and therefore aligned with its interests.
1.13.4. Con: The EU will feel a greater sense of [cohesiveness](https://www.thebalance.com/brexit-consequences-4062999) without the UK holding it back on key issues.
1.13.4.1. Con: EU's cohesion policy is in under threat due to economic and financial effects of Brexit. [Budget consequences article.](https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-gets-glimpse-of-post-brexit-eu-budget-horrors/) [Report on cohesion policy challenges in the light of Brexit.](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/83499/1/Begg_Cohesion%20policy_2017.pdf)
1.13.4.2. Pro: EU officials think [greater integration](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-future-timmermans/germany-and-france-to-lead-post-brexit-eu-in-further-integration-idUSKBN19I14O) will be possible without the UK's opposition.
1.13.4.2.1. Pro: The UK's special EU Reform deal would have included exemption from the "[Ever Closer Union](https://fullfact.org/europe/explaining-eu-deal-ever-closer-union/)" of the EU.
1.13.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.3.1.
1.13.4.4. Con: -> See 1.13.3.1.4.
1.13.5. Con: The UK has no obligation to the EU, and should only do what is in its interests. The harms to the EU of Brexit are irrelevant.
1.13.5.1. Con: If the UK leaving the EU harms the lives of millions of people in Europe, this is a relevant factor in the decision at a moral level.
1.13.5.1.1. Pro: Even in terms of national interest, acting immorally by harming the lives of European citizens also has a negative consequence of harming the UK's relations and public image.
1.13.5.2. Con: This debate is not inherently from the UK's perspective. It is unclear why we should not also factor in the benefit of hundreds of millions of people in Europe.
1.13.5.3. Con: Whether within or outside of the EU the UK needs to take the interests of its closest allies \(the EU member states\) into account for its foreign policy. This is because they share many geopolitical interests which are less likely to be promoted with a weakened EU.
1.13.5.4. Con: The harms to the EU can lead to economical, political or other crises which can spread beyond the EU borders.
1.13.6. Pro: A hard Brexit makes the expansion of the EU more [challenging.](https://www.ft.com/content/2cd87b08-42ac-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d)
1.13.6.1. Pro: The UK has long been a [vocal proponent of extending](https://www.ft.com/content/2cd87b08-42ac-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d) the bloc into ex-communist central and eastern Europe. Other donor states will become less willing and able to support this without the support and funding of the UK.
1.13.6.1.1. Con: Germany, not the UK, has taken the lead on many accession talks [since 2014](http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=1014763485&Country=Albania&topic=Politics&subtopic=Forecast&subsubtopic=International+relations).
1.13.6.2. Con: EU expansion is bad for Europe and bad for accession states.
1.13.6.2.1. Pro: As [Greece](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21724810-country-saves-too-much-and-spends-too-little-why-germanys-current-account-surplus-bad) demonstrated, newly added states to the EU cannot compete with the larger and more developed economies of Western Europe. This leads to loss of industry, jobs, and forces the countries to run government deficits to offset trade imbalances.
1.13.6.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.8.5.
1.13.6.2.2. Pro: As we see with [Hungary](http://carnegieeurope.eu/2017/09/04/defending-eu-values-in-poland-and-hungary-pub-72988), some states have competing values to the EU and once added foment internal conflict and a crisis of common values.
1.13.6.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.12.3.
1.13.6.2.2.2. Pro: Turkey, run by what is considered to be an [authoritarian regime](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/07/how-erdogan-made-turkey-authoritarian-again/492374/) by many, is one of the states that has been considered historically in accession debates. Its competing values upon admission would certainly call the EU's values into question.
1.13.6.2.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.10.5.2.
1.13.6.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.5.1.12.
1.13.6.2.3. Pro: New member states tend to put economic strains on the funds of the union as we have [seen in the past](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/2565277.stm). This not only puts economic strain on the union, but reduces the available structural funding for current EU recipients.
1.13.6.2.4. Con: Growth potential in accession states like [Serbia](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-future-of-serbia-s-economy/) and [Ukraine](https://www.ft.com/content/9d2173a2-60d7-11e7-8814-0ac7eb84e5f1) is high. They could be strong trade partners for the EU \(and the UK if they stay\).
1.13.6.2.5. Con: Prospects of EU accession have long been drivers of reforms preventing ethnic conflict and discrimination. Political analysts and diplomats worry that the loss of EU leverage in accession states could pose a [security threat](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-cee-integration/central-european-states-urge-eu-to-speed-up-enlargement-in-west-balkans-idUSKBN19V1FT) for entire European community.
1.13.6.2.6. Con: The EU is [based on](https://europa.eu/european-union/topics/human-rights_en) “freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.” This is universal and does not just apply to original member states. Once they meet democratic and economic criteria, the EU has a moral obligation to let accession states in.
1.13.6.2.7. Con: Adding new members to the EU like Ukraine and states in the Western Balkans gives it strength in numbers and increased leverage on a global stage as a bloc.
1.13.6.2.8. Con: The influence of Russia in the [Balkans](http://www.lse.ac.uk/LSEE-Research-on-South-Eastern-Europe/Assets/Documents/Events/Conferences-Symposia-Programmes-and-Agendas/2015-Report-Russia-in-the-Balkans-merged-document.pdf) and [Ukraine](http://theweek.com/articles/449691/ukraines-fraught-relationship-russia-brief-history) is troublesome for the UK and the EU. Russia constitutes an [attractive model](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-reports/ever-farther-union-balkans-and-brexit) of government for a number of regional leaders, who might seek to align their policies more with Russia and other non-EU actors. If these states are not brought into the EU fold they may fall back under the influence of Russia which is not in the UK or EU's interest geopolitically.
1.13.6.3. Pro: Brexit makes states deciding to join the EU more [uncertain](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-reports/ever-farther-union-balkans-and-brexit) about its future and thus [less likely](https://www.voanews.com/a/brexit-dampens-zeal-for-serbias-eu-bid/3407552.html) to join.
1.13.6.3.1. Con: The accession process is likely to remain a foreign policy priority for all western Balkan countries because these states do not have a [viable economic alternative](http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=1014763485&Country=Albania&topic=Politics&subtopic=Forecast&subsubtopic=International+relations).
1.13.6.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.13.6.2.8.
1.13.7. Pro: Brexit will harm the economies of EU countries.
1.13.7.1. Con: Poland is [actively attempting](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-hopes-brexit-will-lead-its-native-stars-home/) to draw skilled young workers back from the UK to benefit the Polish economy.
1.13.7.1.1. Con: Poland is the [biggest](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36620886) beneficiary of EU funds, which are transforming the country. The UK leaving means there are less funds for countries like Poland.
1.13.7.2. Con: A [number of companies](https://www.verdict.co.uk/which-companies-could-leave-the-uk-because-of-brexit/) may relocate to other countries within the EU after the UK leaves.
1.13.7.3. Pro: The loss of jobs for migrant workers may [harm](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-economy-europe/from-trade-to-migration-how-brexit-may-hit-the-eu-economy-idUKKCN0ZA0KE) the economies that currently export workers to the UK.
1.13.7.3.1. Pro: Migrants working in the UK sent [£1.5 billion to £16.5 billion in Remittances](http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/migrant-remittances-to-and-from-the-uk/) to their home countries \(in 2014\).
1.13.7.3.2. Con: Skilled migrant workers remaining in their home countries may in fact boost their economies.
1.13.7.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.7.1.
1.13.7.3.3. Con: Other EU developed EU economies, such as France and Germany, may [benefit](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-economy-europe/from-trade-to-migration-how-brexit-may-hit-the-eu-economy-idUKKCN0ZA0KE) from an influx of workers who can no longer work in the UK.
1.13.7.4. Pro: The loss of the UK's total contribution to the EU budget leaves a gap to fill of just over [5 percent](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-economy-europe/from-trade-to-migration-how-brexit-may-hit-the-eu-economy-idUKKCN0ZA0KE).
1.13.7.4.1. Pro: This will necessitate cuts in the budget, perhaps causing [development funds](https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-gets-glimpse-of-post-brexit-eu-budget-horrors/) for Western European nations to be scrapped.
1.13.7.5. Pro: European countries will experience [reduced trade volumes](https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-impact-on-european-regions-revealed-by-eu-report-phase-2-negotiations/) because of trade restrictions with the UK.
1.13.8. Pro: Europe faces a world in turmoil. The UK will be weaker outside the EU. This is not the time for Brexit. This is the time to come together and stand up for Europe.
1.13.8.1. Pro: Russian mafia groups are [reported](http://www.dw.com/en/russian-mafia-groups-reportedly-operate-in-europe-on-behalf-of-the-kremlin/a-38617828) to be operating in the EU on behalf of the Russian government.
1.13.8.2. Pro: Some criminal gangs in Russia may be [more powerful](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/03/16/russian_exile_mikhail_khodorkovsky_a_criminal_gang_runs_the_kremlin_putin_may_no_longer_be_main_boss.html) than the government itself, and thus represent an even greater risk for the stability of Europe.
1.13.8.3. Pro: The political turmoil in the United States is [destabilising](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/markets/us-political-turmoil-sends-shockwave-through-global-markets-1.3312843) the stock market in European countries.
1.13.8.4. Pro: The United States Trump government [may be corrupt](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-white-house-howard-dean-vermont-governor-criminal-democratic-dnc-chair-a8130396.html), which means it is perhaps a less useful and less reliable ally for Europe.
1.14. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.12.4.
1.15. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.4.1.12.5.
1.16. Con: The UK [might have to re-enter](http://uk.businessinsider.com/uk-supreme-court-article-50-notice-cannot-be-withdrawn-2017-1) the EU.
1.16.1. Con: The author of Article 50, Lord Kerr, [says](http://uk.businessinsider.com/lord-kerr-author-article-50-brexit-reversed-high-court-ruling-2016-11) that Britain would not have to reenter.
1.16.2. Pro: The UK Supreme Court, when ruling on whether parliament had to vote to start the Brexit process, [proceeded on the basis](http://www.mondaq.com/uk/x/589132/Constitutional+Administrative+Law/Brexit+Judgment+UK+Supreme+Court+Dismisses+The+Governments+Appeal) that notice, once given, cannot be withdrawn.
1.16.2.1. Con: The UK Supreme court is not the EU supreme court and the UK is currently still in the EU. It is not for the UK courts alone to decide how Art.50 should be interpreted. Art.50 was drawn up by the EU and the UK was fully engaged in it's construction, but not the meaning of its contents, retrospectively, when actually applied.
1.16.2.1.1. Con: The UK Supreme court is not bound by treaty to refer questions of interpretation to the ECJ. It need only do so if it considers that a decision on the question is [necessary to enable it to give judgment](https://www.supremecourt.uk/about/the-supreme-court-and-europe.html).
1.16.2.2. Con: This decision was not meant to say we would have to re-enter, it was just setting assumptions to enable other decisions.
1.16.3. Pro: If the UK re-enters, it would get a worse deal than it currently has.
1.16.3.1. Pro: As a new member the UK would have to adopt [the euro.](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/euro-area/enlargement-euro-area/who-can-join-and-when_en)
1.16.3.1.1. Pro: This would result in an astronomical cost to the treasury, requiring the complete replacement of a well-established currency. This [article](https://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2016/nov/01/new-pound-coin-uk-march-how-much-cost) highlights a rough estimate of the costs of replacing just the new pound coin - never mind an entire currency system.
1.16.3.2. Con: The UK didn't get a good deal previously.
1.16.3.2.1. Pro: The UK was forced to accept uncontrolled migration of workers from 27 other countries, many of which are linguistically, culturally and economically different to the UK.
1.16.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.10.4.
1.16.3.2.2. Pro: The UK was forced to accept laws and interpretations laid down by a foreign court.
1.16.3.2.3. Pro: The UK was unable to strike trade deals with 3rd countries that are in its best interests.
1.16.3.2.4. Pro: The UK had to pay billions and billions of pounds to prop up a bloated foreign bureaucracy.
1.16.3.2.4.1. Con: The UK has to hire [a large amount](http://uk.businessinsider.com/may-government-hired-3000-people-to-deliver-brexit-2017-10?r=UK&IR=T) of bureaucrats when they leave the EU.
1.16.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: By sharing bureaucracies with the EU, member states including the UK can save money.
1.16.3.2.4.2. Con: The [EU budget](http://ec.europa.eu/budget/explained/myths/myths_en.cfm) is less than 1% of its GDP. This is considerably lower than any other government.
1.16.3.2.4.3. Con: Most of the EU budget [goes](http://ec.europa.eu/budget/explained/myths/myths_en.cfm) directly to investments, not to bureaucracy.
1.16.3.3. Pro: As a new member the UK would lose it's [special rebate](https://theconversation.com/the-uks-eu-rebate-explained-58019) \(66% of the UK's net contribution\).
1.16.3.4. Pro: The UK negotiated special changes to EU membership \([EU Reform Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_renegotiation_of_European_Union_membership,_2015%E2%80%9316)\), which were due to come into effect after a "Remain" vote.
1.16.3.4.1. Con: These perks would have to be renegotiated if the UK remains, as they were made before Brexit, on the assumption of a remain vote.
1.16.3.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.13.4.2.1.
1.16.4. Con: France [says that](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/uk-can-cancel-brexit-stay-12984264) there would be no need to re-enter.
1.16.5. Con: The UK's Lords’ European Union committee [concluded that](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/16/uk-ministers-pressed-to-reveal-legal-advice-on-reversing-brexit) “a member state could legally reverse a decision to withdraw from the EU”.
1.16.6. Pro: The EU commissioned an [official report on UK re-entry](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2018/596820/IPOL_IDA\(2018\)596820_EN.pdf), which said that CJEU \(Court of Justice of the European Union\) jurisdiction would be required for a final say.
1.16.7. Con: Many EU officials are of the opinion that regardless of article 50 having been triggered the process can be stopped without re-entering.
1.16.7.1. Con: None of these people appear to wield the power to decide how EU treaties are interpreted.
1.16.7.2. Con: The fact that this is still not the official policy of the EU suggests that this belief is not shared by those in the EU with the power to make such determinations.
1.16.7.2.1. Con: Those who have the power to make such determinations \(members of the CJEU\) have no incentive to do the work to make an official legal decision. Whether they personally believe the UK would need reentry or would just remain is unknown, and also inconsequential, until they researched and evaluated the decision officially.
