Discussion Title: Is Attachment Parenting the Best Way to Raise a Child?

1. [Attachment Parenting](http://www.attachmentparenting.org/principles/care) is the Best Way to Raise a Child.
1.1. Con: Attachment parenting is deleterious for feminism by virtue of relegating women to 'traditional' gender roles.
1.1.1. Con: Feminism is about choice: if a woman chooses attachment parenting as her way of raising her child, that does not diminish her feminist leanings.
1.1.1.1. Con: Promoting attachment parenting makes women feel as if they need to be at home with their child all the time in order to be a good parent; that pressure of being a good mother deprives women of a genuine choice.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Feminism is about being able to choose your role. If a woman chooses attachment parenting, then it's just as feminist as being the CEO of a company. There's [nothing wrong](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/joanna-hyatt/when-did-feminism-become-_b_13666536.html) with "women's work" even though Western society devalues it.
1.1.2. Con: Attachment parenting ensures that girls grow up to be strong, educated and confident women which will help them effectively challenge patriarchal structures in society.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Attachment parenting aids mental development.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Children in France, who are traditionally raised to learn self-control early on, are less often diagnosed with [ADHD](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/suffer-the-children/201203/why-french-kids-dont-have-adhd), suggesting that attachment parenting, where the parents must cater to every need of the child whenever the child wants, may facilitate ADHD in children.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: France's High Health Authority [officially disagreed](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pay-attention/201511/french-kids-do-have-adhd) with the assessment made in the article above that only 0.5 children in France are diagnosed with ADHD. The agency has also suggested that a cause of under-reporting of ADHD in France is 'due to the inadequate training of care providers, inequalities in access to care as well as the stigma and misconceptions surrounding ADHD.'
1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: ADHD is [not caused](https://www.additudemag.com/is-adhd-hereditary-yes-and-no/) by parenting style.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: The stability provided by attachment parenting positively shapes how the child [interacts with the world](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5576/ca056c7c286e0e73dd0b1a4236f324d32280.pdf).
1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Early caregivers serve as a model for how children characterize relationships and social expectations later in life.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Adolescents who developed ambivalent attachment patterns as children reported [significantly more](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/147608303770584728) interpersonal difficulties and symptoms compared to young people classified as having secure and avoidant attachment classifications from childhood.
1.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Babies who respond positively to close physical contact with their parent also display less distress and generally [respond better](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5576/ca056c7c286e0e73dd0b1a4236f324d32280.pdf) to being set down for independent exploration or play.
1.1.2.1.2.3. Pro: Attachment parenting has been shown to [increase compassion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16351370) in children.
1.1.2.1.2.4. Pro: Children raised through attachment parenting deal better with [separation](http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-55579-001.html) than children who are not.
1.1.2.1.2.5. Pro: Attachment parenting promotes [greater independence](https://www.parentingscience.com/attachment-parenting.html) in adult life; children feel supported by the parents' presence to have the confidence to explore the world on their own.
1.1.2.1.2.5.1. Pro: For a child, the [knowledge](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/emotional-nourishment/201706/some-thoughts-independence) that they have others in their lives who they can turn to for comfort, support, and security is essential in fostering independence. By fostering a close and secure relationship with the child, attachment parenting ensures this happens.
1.1.2.1.2.5.2. Pro: Attachment parenting is about being sensitive to the needs of children; when the child needs and wants independence, the parents not only allow them to stand on their own two feet, they [encourage](https://unnecessarywisdom.wordpress.com/2013/06/13/how-attachment-parenting-produces-independent-kids/) the child as well.
1.1.2.1.2.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.2.
1.1.2.1.2.5.4. Con: Children can become inappropriately emotionally sensitive and dependent because of attachment parenting.
1.1.2.1.2.5.4.1. Pro: Children [naturally detach](http://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/winnicott1.pdf) from the biologically close form of relationship with their parent beginning around 4-6 months and concluding around 8-12 months.
1.1.2.1.2.5.4.2. Pro: Children can struggle to [become independent](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/children/9399989/Attachment-parenting-Can-baby-be-too-attached.html) due to how much they depend on the attached parent.
1.1.2.1.2.5.4.2.1. Con: In the source linked above, attachment parenting is unfairly equated to [intensive](https://books.google.com/books?id=ixUuDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=sharon+hayes+sociologist+parenting&source=bl&ots=cmzDP3DhtB&sig=T9JoAjW5fwcQ_PrzHDQ27TAYikk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjL2dSmsrraAhUPrVkKHSIcBQIQ6AEITzAE#v=onepage&q=sharon%20hayes%20sociologist%20parenting&f=false)  parenting, but these are two very different things. Negative effects that arise due to misinterpreting the principles of AP and engaging in some other form of parenting instead should not be blamed on AP.
1.1.2.1.2.5.4.2.1.1. Pro: Any method or theory, when exaggerated or misused, will have undesirable outcomes. That is not because of the method.
1.1.2.1.2.5.4.2.2. Con: The cited [author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Furedi) makes the assumption that "\(AP\) mothers and fathers live their lives through their children and cease to have regard for the boundaries, parents and children are so closely entwined that the independence of the children can be compromised" without supporting evidence.
1.1.2.1.2.5.4.2.3. Con: Toddlers \(when securely attached\) only turn to their primary caregiver more [in moments of distress](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638312001117).
1.1.2.1.2.5.4.3. Pro: Children raised under attachment parenting are often very afraid to leave their parents even for short periods of time.
1.1.2.1.2.5.4.3.1. Con: This [natural behavior](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/separation-anxiety) is no measure of their clinginess [when adults](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/compassion-matters/201307/how-your-attachment-style-impacts-your-relationship).
1.1.2.1.2.5.4.4. Con: Children raised through attachment parenting could have an easier time separating because the practices [encourage](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1992.tb00939.x) the [progression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4033092/) of their natural phases of attachment.
1.1.2.1.2.5.4.5. Pro: In trying to ensure the best possible outcome parents may overreach and become too attached, leading to pathological co-dependent behavior called [enmeshment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enmeshment).
1.1.2.1.2.5.4.5.1. Pro: In practice, it is [difficult](https://theparentingpassageway.com/2013/01/23/attachment-parenting-whats-going-on/) for parents to [identify](https://theparentingpassageway.com/2013/01/28/part-two-attachment-parenting-whats-going-on/) the line between attachment parenting and enmeshment; as a result some parents end up creating an enmeshed relationship with their child.
1.1.2.1.2.5.4.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.5.4.2.1.1.
1.1.2.1.2.5.4.6. Con: Children become inappropriately sensitive and dependent as the result of overprotective parents. Not as the result of a method.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.5.4.
1.1.2.1.4. Con: Attachment parenting - in being exclusionary towards fathers - can only partially aid mental development. Babies need strong relationships with their fathers too; seeing a caring father figure instructs children in male responsibility and roles.
1.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Babies are naturally focused on [one primary caregiver](https://www.simplypsychology.org/attachment.html) during the first 9 months. In this time fathers play a different, but equally important role, and will be bonding as [secondary caregivers](https://www.simplypsychology.org/attachment.html) between 10 and 18 months.
1.1.2.1.5. Pro: Attachment parenting [promotes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4995667/) the development of a secure style of [attachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory) as an adult.
1.1.2.1.6. Con: Even if the method helps secure attachment, it can still go wrong because of divorce, hospital stay, illness or death in the family.
1.1.2.1.7. Pro: Extensive breastfeeding \([beyond 6 months of age](https://kellymom.com/fun/trivia/bf-rates-2004/)\) provides positive benefits that are supported by research.
1.1.2.1.7.1. Con: Breastfeeding restricts the [freedom](http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/breastfeeding-benefits-and-disadvantages) of women. A nursing mother’s breasts must be available for every feeding, regardless of time of day or location. Not being able to find the time to breastfeed the child can lead to the child not being adequately fed.
1.1.2.1.7.2. Pro: There is a [positive](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/1/e137) [relationship](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/194901) between the length of breastfeeding and cognitive achievement later in life.
1.1.2.1.7.2.1. Pro: According to one [study](https://www.today.com/health/more-evidence-breastfeeding-makes-babies-smarter-t9651), babies who are breastfed for at least a year grow up to be significantly more intelligent as adults and they earn more money.
1.1.2.1.7.2.1.1. Pro: Participants who were breastfed for [12 months or more](https://www.today.com/health/more-evidence-breastfeeding-makes-babies-smarter-t9651) had higher IQ scores \(difference of 3.76 points\), more years of education and higher monthly incomes than did those who were breastfed for less than 1 month.
1.1.2.1.7.2.1.1.1. Con: Parents who can dedicate themselves to breastfeeding for 12 months are likely to be of [higher socioeconomic status](https://qz.com/1034016/the-class-dynamics-of-breastfeeding-in-the-united-states-of-america/), which makes the child's income and IQ unlikely to be a direct result of breastfeeding.
1.1.2.1.7.2.1.2. Con: The study [did not track](https://www.romper.com/p/how-attachment-parenting-affects-kids-later-in-life-22854) the socio-economic status of the participants, hence it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions from this study.
1.1.2.1.7.3. Pro: Extensive breastfeeding has been shown to [correlate positively](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2957551/?tool=pubmed) with psychosocial development.
1.1.2.1.7.4. Pro: Breastfeeding has been shown to [reduce](https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-breastfeeding-benefits-you-and-your-baby_8910.bc?page=3#articlesection6) incidences of [post-partum depression](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007215.htm), which is the moderate to severe depression a woman can experience after giving birth, and which ultimately negatively impact the developing relationship between mother and child.
1.1.2.1.7.5. Pro: Breastfeeding has been linked with a lower risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome \([SIDS](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-breastfeeding-sids-idUSTRE75C2V220110613)\).
1.1.2.1.7.6. Con: Antidepressants and other medications, alcohol, caffeine and recreational drugs consumed by mothers can be passed to the child through [breastfeeding](http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/breastfeeding-benefits-and-disadvantages), potentially putting the child's health [at risk](https://www.breastfeedingbasics.com/articles/drugs-and-breastfeeding).
1.1.2.1.7.6.1. Con: Although there is some risk associated with antidepressant use, the risk of untreated depression may be [even greater](https://www.infantrisk.com/content/antidepressant-usage-during-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding).
1.1.2.1.7.6.2. Con: [Moderate consumption](https://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/lifestyle/caffeine/) of caffeine is likely to not present significant harms to the breastfeeding child.
1.1.2.1.7.7. Con: Unlike using formula to feed a child, mothers who breastfeed are unable to [measure](http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/breastfeeding-benefits-and-disadvantages) how much milk their baby is drinking. This runs the risk of either not feeding the baby enough leading to nutritional deficiencies, or overfeeding. Both potential outcomes are dangerous for the health of a baby.
1.1.2.1.7.7.1. Con: [As a general rule](https://themilkmeg.com/can-i-overfeed-my-breastfed-baby/) it is impossible to overfeed a breastfed baby.
1.1.2.1.7.7.2. Con: There are reliable ways to determine if an infant is breastfeeding well, such as [stool colour and weight gain](http://www.nancymohrbacher.com/articles/2015/8/17/the-clock-and-early-breastfeeding). [Checking the latch](https://www.askdrsears.com/topics/feeding-eating/breastfeeding/rightstart-techniques/baby-latching-and-sucking-efficiently-how-tell) during feeding is another way.
1.1.2.1.7.7.3. Pro: Breastfeeding support for new mothers is important because many mothers worry about whether or not their child is breastfeeding well enough.
1.1.2.1.7.7.4. Con: Formula marketing claims exploit mothers' uncertainties about nursing. Suggesting that the ability to see the number of ounces in a bottle results in better infant health is a [marketing ploy](https://www.citizen.org/sites/default/files/public-hospitals-infant-formula-marketing-report-april-2016.pdf), not a fact.
1.1.2.1.8. Pro: Attachment parenting minimises infant stress.
1.1.2.1.8.1. Pro: Attachment parenting ensures that a child [appropriately relies](http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-55579-001.html) on their parent for comfort and support, particularly when stressed, afraid or ill.
1.1.2.1.8.1.1. Pro: Consistency and promptness of maternal response is [associated](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1127506.pdf?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) with decline in frequency and duration of infant crying.
1.1.2.1.8.1.1.1. Con: Crying in either infants or adults is [not necessarily a bad thing](https://archive.org/stream/TearsAndTantrums-AlethaJ.Solter/tears-tantrums-Solter_djvu.txt), with crying acting as a tool to reduce tension.
1.1.2.1.8.2. Pro: The [more a child is held](http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-55579-001.html), the less the child cries.
1.1.2.1.8.2.1. Pro: Excessive crying and fear of abandonment [can be](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/moral-landscapes/201112/dangers-crying-it-out) [developmentally damaging](https://www.askdrsears.com/topics/health-concerns/fussy-baby/science-excessive-crying-harmful) to young children.
1.1.2.1.8.2.1.1. Con: Certain studies referenced in the link have explicitly [rejected](http://ideas.time.com/2012/05/10/the-science-behind-dr-sears-does-it-stand-up/) the article's conclusions, suggesting that their research involved "babies and young children whose parents are in the pathological range of neglect and maltreatment … not children with normative, ‘good-enough’ parenting.”
1.1.2.1.8.2.1.1.1. Pro: Crying is often a symptom of abuse or neglect, but should not be confused as [the cause](http://ideas.time.com/2012/05/10/the-science-behind-dr-sears-does-it-stand-up/) of developmental damage.
1.1.2.1.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.8.1.1.1.
1.1.2.1.8.2.3. Con: Attachment parenting does not claim crying is bad, but that [crying without a response](http://www.awareparenting.com/cryinginarms.htm) can cause stress.
1.1.2.1.8.3. Pro: [Stress in infants](http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-55579-001.html) can have an irreversible impact on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical \(HPA\) axis and on the production of neurohormones; this means that the stress response throughout one's life is more easily triggered than in others, even in situations of comparably low stress.
1.1.2.1.9. Pro: Attachment parenting leads to [more intelligent](https://www.parentingscience.com/attachment-parenting.html) children, due to practices such as breastfeeding.
1.1.2.1.9.1. Con: Equally, this may be because smarter kids are better able to form secure relationships, rather than secure attachments leading to higher intelligence. The source in the parent itself says that there are only 'hints' that secure attachments are linked with higher intellectual achievement, and that 'correlation doesn't prove causation. It might be that smarter kids have an easier time forming secure attachments.'
1.1.2.1.9.1.1. Con: There is little proof of this. In fact, many highly intelligent people experience relationship problems.
1.1.2.1.9.2. Pro: Children who have solid attachments to their primary caregiver at a young age develop better self-control, which leads to [better performance](https://www.mother.ly/news/its-science-having-a-secure-attachment-with-your-kids-helps-make-them-smarter#close) in school a decade later.
1.1.2.1.9.3. Pro: Close, secure relationships help a child's brain [develop](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/features/can-you-boost-your-childs-intelligence#2) because neurons get connected through social connection and language.
1.1.2.1.9.4. Pro: Childhood learning is also often [motivated](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/features/can-you-boost-your-childs-intelligence#2) by close relationships. The more the child values the relationship with the parent, the more the child is likely to want to please their parent by working harder and trying to learn more.
1.1.2.1.9.4.1. Con: Pleasing the parent is not always a sign of secure attachment. It can be an extrinsic motivation such as [fear](https://rampages.us/buffingtonpost/2015/04/08/rough-draft/) of [rejection](https://glynissherwood.com/attachment-trauma-relationships-adult-children-abuse-neglect/) in insecurely attached children.
1.1.2.1.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.7.2.
1.1.2.1.9.6. Con: Any benefits for the child's intelligence are a result of breastfeeding, which is not an exclusive component of attachment parenting, but is a common practice even amongst non-AP parents. The higher intelligence could be gained by simply breastfeeding your child, rather than by adopting attachment parenting wholesale.
1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.5.
1.1.3. Con: AP helps empower women by supporting a woman's right to understand how her body functions through the practice of breastfeeding children.
1.1.3.1. Con: Some women may find it far from empowering to experience difficult changes to their body that accompany breastfeeding - engorged breasts leaking milk that need emptying regularly.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Increased awareness of and support for breastfeeding can help undermine stigma against the natural function of women's bodies.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Seeing the powerful and important role that breastfeeding plays in the early development of a child's wellbeing can help boost women's sense of self-worth.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: Deriving self-worth from the state of motherhood works to reinforce conservative dogmas about the role of women in our society.
1.1.4. Pro: Attachment parenting is almost exclusively aimed at mothers; fathers are overlooked and their roles minimised, even though a strong relationship between a father and a child is [beneficial](https://www.parent4success.com/2014/03/03/20-reasons-why-children-need-dads/) for both.
1.1.4.1. Con: Fathers can participate in co-sleeping, babywearing and responding to baby needs such as soothing. These physical activities are not limited to the mother.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: If the mother is not working and spends most of her time available to care for the child because she is breastfeeding, it is likely the mother will also be the primary caregiver in other ways.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The consequences of involved fathering for father-child attachment security are dependent upon qualitative aspects of fathering behaviour. When a father engages in high quality parenting behaviour, a secure attachment may develop [regardless](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-19634-003) of the amount of time the father spends with the child.
1.1.4.1.1.2. Con: Mothers are often the primary caregiver in other parenting methods; attachment parenting only requires them to be marginally more involved.
1.1.4.1.1.3. Pro: Due to the proximity needed for breastfeeding at all hours of the day, the mother is likely to take on other childcare tasks because she is available and present for them, i.e. baby-wearing, changing nappies, or bathing the child.
1.1.4.1.1.4. Pro: If the mother is not working, the father probably is.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: If a child is breastfeeding, they will become more immediately attached to their mother \(as the source of food\) and will likely prefer to receive care from the mother, reducing the role of the non-lactating parent.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Con: Babies develop a spread of attachment relationships simultaneously with the adults with whom they interact regularly – [including their fathers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247499772_Fathers_in_attachment_theory_and_research_A_review).
1.1.4.2. Pro: A large aspect of attachment parenting focuses on extended breastfeeding, which excludes parents who can't lactate from it.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.3.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: Fathers [can](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-males-can-lactate/) lactate, too.
1.1.4.3. Con: Even if [fathers have a different role](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4422500/) in the first year of AP, their care, support, providing for and protecting the family are just as important and challenging parts of AP.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.4.1.
1.1.4.4. Pro: Both father and mother have equal responsibilities towards their children, on a daily basis as well as on long term; it is deleterious to all concerned to exclude fathers.
1.1.4.5. Con: There is no evidence that [fathers practicing attachment parenting](https://www.askdrsears.com/topics/parenting/child-rearing-and-development/fathering/becoming-dad-dr-bills-story) are less involved or bonded.
1.1.4.6. Pro: There is [evidence](http://theconversation.com/do-mothers-really-have-stronger-bonds-with-their-children-than-fathers-do-57590) to support that fathers can form just as strong a bond with their child as mothers.
1.1.5. Pro: Some attachment parenting groups [instruct](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=cVRFAAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP5&dq=attachment+parenting&ots=tLZR0gqZnm&sig=-XGRYJt_W0Ydo7aXbdky7s0mCrY#v=onepage&q=attachment%20parenting&f=false) women to breastfeed their children until at least 3-4 years of age, and as late as 8 years old, although the practice is time-intensive and can impose constraints on the woman's daily life.
1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.
1.1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.1.8. Pro: Though "traditional" gender roles are not necessarily wrong, giving all the responsibility and role in \(early\) parenting to the mother only will give a wrong vision of education and caring to the child, perpetuating harmful stereotypes.
1.1.8.1. Con: Not every role model is a harmful stereotype. Being a caring parent can be a great model for boys and girls.
1.1.9. Con: Feminism isn't just about women being equal to men, but also about values like care, empathy and education becoming as important to society as they are to our offspring.
1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.3. Pro: Attachment parenting leads to physically healthier children.
1.3.1. Con: Other factors, such as [nutrition and exercise](http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_young_people/en/), also contribute to a child's physical health.
1.3.1.1. Con: There is no reason why attachment parenting cannot be adopted along with other means of improving the child's physical health.
1.3.2. Con: It is certainly true that children who are neglected and abused suffer neurocognitive impairment and socio-emotional problems; however, this is not the case in the vast majority of Western parenting. This has not stopped certain proponents of attachment parenting from making [false equivalences](https://www.parentingscience.com/attachment-parenting.html) in the hope of promoting their ethos.
1.3.3. Pro: [Responsive parenting](https://www.parentingscience.com/responsive-parenting-health-benefits.html) creates children with fewer cortisol fluctuations, reducing the risk of a variety of metabolic conditions, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.
1.3.3.1. Con: It is possible to practise [responsive parenting](https://www.aptaclub.co.uk/article/supporting-your-toddlers-development-through-responsive-parenting) without having to go to the lengths of attachment parenting.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Just because it is potentially easier to practice responsive parenting doesn't mean it is as good or better than other methods.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: Attachment parenting and responsive parenting are terms often used synonymously, which makes discussing them as different relatively arbitrary.
1.3.4. Pro: [Extended breastfeeding](https://www.parents.com/baby/breastfeeding/tips/benefits-of-extended-breastfeeding/) provides nutrition, boosts the immune system and supports physical development.
1.3.4.1. Con: Exclusively [breastfeeding](http://healthybabycode.com/babies-should-be-breastfed-exclusively-for-6-months) is only necessary for a baby's health for the first 6 months. Weaning a child by 12 months of age does not cause medical harm.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: If the child is younger than two years, the child is at [increased risk](https://www.aafp.org/about/policies/all/breastfeeding-support.html) of illness if weaned.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: The absence of medical harm does not reflect what would be optimum for the child.
1.3.4.2. Pro: In the second year of breastfeeding, breast milk [provides](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11236735) one third of the energy requirements, half the protein and a large proportion of vitamin requirements \(A, B12, C and folate\) for the child.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: In some parts of the world where the adult diet may be inadequate in providing key nutrients, such as [Kenya](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2567774/?tool=pubmed) or [Bangladesh](http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/food/V194e/ch08.htm), extended breastfeeding can serve as a vital source of Vitamin A, niacin and fats.
1.3.4.3. Pro: [Several](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3633073) [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8019249) [support](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1936731) the assertion that extended breastfeeding provides direct health benefits.
1.3.4.4. Pro: Immune factors in breastmilk [increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6880736) in the second year of breastfeeding.
1.3.5. Pro: Children subjected to early or [developmental trauma](http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-55579-001.html) showed "less optimal cardiovascular and neurohormonal outcomes, including elevated blood pressure and cortisol, when engaged in tasks designed to be stressful".
1.3.5.1. Pro: This was not discovered exclusively in extreme situations \(abuse, criminal neglect\) but also in circumstances that many children experience: maternal depression, socioeconomic background, and 'low quality maternal behaviour'.
1.4. Con: Attachment parenting is exclusionary.
1.4.1. Pro: Attachment parenting is difficult for working class women to adopt as the parenting method can end up costing the mothers significant amount of money.
1.4.1.1. Pro: In order to [fully implement](http://msmagazine.com/blog/2012/06/13/momtroversy-how-feminist-is-attachment-parenting/) AP, a woman needs to have the economic means to live on one income, and the time to devote herself entirely to mothering.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: AP requires a substantial monetary commitment.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Equating the inability or unwillingness to make such an investment with "bad parenting" is economic elitism.
1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Breast-feeding may [negatively influence](https://www.livescience.com/19934-hidden-cost-breast-feeding.html) a woman's earnings in the long run.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: [Employers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinehoward/2012/05/10/time-magazine-has-the-wrong-breast-on-its-cover/#2692dc1335ff) might not be able or willing to allow mothers to bring children with them to work, and keeping them close-by at all times.
1.4.1.1.3. Con: Families or individual mothers could take out a loan to cover the additional expenses.
1.4.1.1.3.1. Con: The financial burden of a loan, along with a gap in career and a reduction in lifetime earning potential due to an unpaid/unsecured maternity leave, just serve to exacerbate the position of a working mother.
1.4.1.1.3.2. Con: Loans and credit can often be unavailable to people of a disadvantaged socioeconomic background, making attachment parenting inaccessible to them by necessity.
1.4.1.1.4. Pro: Attachment parenting is bad for society because it alienates one or two adults to the needs of one infant, thus not making them able to contribute to society in other ways, either through work, research or even charity.
1.4.1.1.4.1. Con: Raising children well is important to sustain a society, hence parenting is still a contribution.
1.4.1.1.4.2. Con: [Working](http://www.attachmentparenting.org/parentingtopics/special-areas/work-ap) outside the home and attachment parenting are not mutually exclusive.
1.4.1.1.5. Con: Attachment parenting makes redundant a number of things parents usually buy for the baby, which makes being a parent a lot [cheaper](http://www.scarymommy.com/attachment-parenting-out-of-laziness/). You don't need to buy baby formula or bottles as you breastfeed, baby carriers since you carry the baby in your arms or on a sling around you, and cribs since you co-sleep.
1.4.1.1.5.1. Con: Some parents may be [unable](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/michelle-mchale/5-reasons-attachment-pare_b_11214140.html) to breastfeed, co-sleep or wear the baby on them, in which instance AP will still require the parent to buy all the items a non-AP parent will buy, removing any savings that may have been made.
1.4.1.1.6. Con: Some countries provide adequate support for childcare in the form of generous parental benefits, and job security of returning to your previous job being guaranteed by law.
1.4.1.1.6.1. Pro: Estonia provides 18 months of [parental benefits](http://mdm.wageindicator.org/chart/maternity/233) at the rate of 100% of the average salary the parent received in the preceding year.
1.4.1.1.6.2. Pro: Parental leave policies in [some](http://www.businessinsider.com/countries-with-best-parental-leave-2016-8) [countries](http://www.businessinsider.com/countries-best-paternity-leave-2017-6) [provide](http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/19/news/economy/countries-most-maternity-leave/index.html) adequate financial support to the new parents.
1.4.1.1.6.2.1. Con: According to this article, Serbia only provides 100% benefit for the first 26 weeks, after that it goes from 60 to 30% eventually. Assuming a [median income](https://tradingeconomics.com/serbia/wages) of about 50,000 RSD \(420 €\) this means that for the last quarter a mother will get about 125 € per month. This is not adequate financial support.
1.4.1.1.6.2.2. Con: [Many](http://www.businessinsider.de/countries-with-best-parental-leave-2016-8?r=US&IR=T#/#hungary-8) of [these](http://www.businessinsider.de/countries-with-best-parental-leave-2016-8?r=US&IR=T#/#serbia-6) [countries](http://www.businessinsider.de/countries-with-best-parental-leave-2016-8?r=US&IR=T#/#belgium-4) only pay for a week or two of leave for fathers.
1.4.1.1.6.3. Pro: Estonia enables parents to take up to three years of parental leave with [guaranteed employment](http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=18228&langId=en) in the previous workplace upon returning from leave.
1.4.1.1.6.4. Con: The US [offers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/06/23/global-view-how-u-s-policies-to-help-working-families-rank-in-the-world/?utm_term=.bc55da736df7) no paid maternity leave, variable child care support with large degrees of variation between support and poor work flexibility laws.
1.4.1.1.6.5. Con: While parental support laws allow women to take time off from work, the more time that is taken off work, the [likelier](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/work/maternity-discrimination-is-pushing-women-out-of-work---and-its/) the woman is to be overlooked for a promotion or be made redundant in the future.
1.4.1.1.6.6. Con: Society having to support other people's children through benefits in an overcrowded world doesn't seem to be the best way to spend tax money.
1.4.1.1.6.6.1. Con: For countries like [Estonia](https://news.err.ee/599528/report-estonia-unable-to-maintain-population-size-without-immigration), the problem is the opposite - low birth rates and high emigration rates lead to a decrease in population. Such policies help counteract that trend.
1.4.1.1.6.6.2. Con: By the same line of argument, society shouldn't support elderly people, sick people, people unable to work etc.
1.4.1.1.6.6.3. Con: With the link between [secure attachment and IQ,](http://cleverkidsconsultancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wellisch.pdf) and the correlation between [high IQ and high income](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2008/02/06/correlations-of-iq-with-income-and-wealth/), the state has an incentive to promote attachment parenting to increase the wealth of its citizens.
1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.4.3. Pro: AP requires a support network, such as extended family, to help with daily tasks.
1.4.4. Pro: AP makes it difficult for women to work, therefore increasing even more the [feminization of poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminization_of_poverty): 2/3 of the poor in the world are women.
1.4.4.1. Con: Extended leave for parents and unconditional basic income could take care of this in the future.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: In 2018, there are only a handful of places in the world experimenting with UBI. And even if fully rolled out in all the places where the governments are currently debating it, it wouldn't cover a significant number of the world's population and would remain a utopia for quite some time.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Attachment parenting excludes working women as the parenting style is too demanding on mothers, making it harder for them to work.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Attachment parenting being the "best" form of parenting would imply that parents who cannot spend excessive amounts of time at home with their child are necessarily bad parents.
1.4.4.2.1.1. Con: Not being able to do the 'best' thing doesn't make your parenting bad, just not 'the best'.
1.4.4.2.2. Pro: Parents on a work schedule would not be able to organize their days based on their child's needs and wishes.
1.4.4.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.4.4.2.2.2. Con: In some countries, such as the [Netherlands](http://www.expatfocus.com/expatriate-netherlands-holland-maternity-childcare), breastfeeding mothers are allowed to use a quarter of their normal working hours to breastfeed in the work place. Working mothers can practice attachment parenting if facilitative laws are passed.
1.4.4.2.3. Con: Even when a parent is away from their child for several hours every day, children and parents [can still create](http://school-age-children.yoexpert.com/child-parenting/how-can-a-working-mom-practice-attachment-parentin-36901.html) a strong emotional bond through attachment parenting.
1.4.4.2.4. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.6.
1.4.5. Pro: Attachment parenting can make women feel incompetent or guilty if unable to breastfeed / cosleep / carry the infant because of medication, addiction or other handicap or condition.
1.4.5.1. Con: All forms of parenting make parents feel guilty. Parents manage to feel guilty no matter what their parenting style is like--because good parents always tend to worry that they aren't doing the best possible job. But that doesn't mean they aren't doing just fine. It just means they care enough to worry.
1.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.2.
1.4.7. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.6.
1.5. Con: The quality of care is more important than the particular method or "way" a child is raised.
1.5.1. Pro: There are an almost infinite number of ways to raise a child. Different schools of thought will always tout different, 'better' ways; however, it is a personal decision parents have to make themselves.
1.5.2. Pro: Even advocates of attachment parenting usually view its principles as just [a list of ideas](http://www.attachmentparenting.org/WhatIsAP.php) - take what works and leave the rest.
1.5.2.1. Pro: It is entirely possible that a person could follow all guidelines of attachment parenting and not raise their child to their maximum potential, simply due to their incompatibility with the method.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: There is no absolute standard for 'maximum potential', and it is not a universally held goal.
1.5.2.1.2. Pro: Parenting is just a small part of raising a child to their full potential. Education, society, family, peer group, personal traits and capabilities, and a lot of chance also play a role.
1.5.2.2. Con: This can be because AP relies on intuition or [instinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_parenting#Instinct_and_nature), rather than written methodology.
1.5.3. Con: However, certain methods of parenting may consistently provide better quality of child care than others.
1.5.3.1. Con: On the [contrary](http://www.developmentalscience.com/blog/2017/3/31/what-is-a-secure-attachmentand-why-doesnt-attachment-parenting-get-you-there), each parenting method can be done insensitively and mechanically, which would prevent the formation of a secure bond between the mother and child. On the other hand, if a parenting method is undertaken in a sensitive, considered manner while picking up on cues from the baby, a secure relationship is likely to form.
1.5.3.2. Con: Often what matters is the [mental state of the parent](http://www.developmentalscience.com/blog/2017/3/31/what-is-a-secure-attachmentand-why-doesnt-attachment-parenting-get-you-there), rather than the particular method prescribed. For instance, while holding and carrying a baby is a good thing, if the caregiver is stressed out or engaged or not picking up on the baby's signals, then the desired result is not achieved.
1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.
1.5.5. Con: Young parents tend to follow any method of parenting too stringently, therefore not allowing any flexibility in their parenting approach. When parents follow attachment parenting without setting any boundaries for the child, it leads to children becoming spoilt.
1.5.5.1. Con: Setting limits and providing appropriate guidelines for children is essential for all good parenting methods. Attachment Parenting [is not permissive parenting](http://attachmentparenting.org/blog/2014/11/12/its-not-called-permissive-parenting/).
1.5.6. Pro: Following a "parenting method" as "the best", carries a risk of fundamentalism, and looking down at other ways of parenting.
1.6. Pro: Attachment parenting is beneficial to society.
1.6.1. Pro: AP accentuates the importance of care, family and bonding in our society.
1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.
1.6.4. Pro: Attachment parenting is more [environmentally friendly](http://www.ecomall.com/greenshopping/mbr.htm). While co-sleeping can save on heating, breastfeeding is [sustainable](http://www.tensteps.org/benefits-of-breastfeeding-for-the-environment-society.shtml) and has a much [lower carbon footprint](http://breastfeedingtoday-llli.org/tiny-feet-large-footprint/) than [formula](http://www.gifa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FormulaForDisaster.pdf).
1.7. Con: Sharing a bed with your baby is dangerous.
1.7.1. Pro: In some cases, co-sleeping has been linked with increased risk of SIDS \(sudden infant death syndrome\).
1.7.1.1. Pro: If the mother or her partner have been drinking alcohol, are smokers or have taken medication that causes drowsiness, co-sleeping [increases](https://www.babycentre.co.uk/x7767/does-co-sleeping-reduce-the-risk-of-sudden-infant-death-syndrome-sids) SIDS risk.
1.7.1.2. Pro: If the baby is less than three months old, was born premature or weighed less than 2.5 kg at birth, co-sleeping [increases](https://www.babycentre.co.uk/x7767/does-co-sleeping-reduce-the-risk-of-sudden-infant-death-syndrome-sids) SIDS risk.
1.7.1.3. Con: If none of the risk factors apply, co-sleeping is a safe option.
1.7.1.3.1. Pro: This study [thoroughly investigates](http://cosleeping.nd.edu/safe-co-sleeping-guidelines/) how to co-sleep safely.
1.7.1.4. Con: The risk of SIDS with bedsharing, for a healthy baby without risk factors, is smaller than the risk of [getting struck by lightning](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/05/21/601289695/is-sleeping-with-your-baby-as-dangerous-as-doctors-say?utm_campaign=storyshare&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social).
1.7.2. Pro: The [dangers of bedsharing](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/29/deaths-babies-linked-bed-sharing-uk-data) include suffocating, overheating, falling out of bed and being crushed.
1.7.3. Con: Most co-sleeping beds attach to the parental bed, rather than the child sleeping between the parents.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Safe sleep guidelines [recommend](http://cosleeping.nd.edu/safe-co-sleeping-guidelines/) that infants sleep near the breastfeeding parent and not between the two parents.
1.7.4. Pro: Mothers can accidentally suffocate their babies while co-sleeping.
1.7.4.1. Con: Healthy breastfeeding mothers are able to [sense the proximity](https://www.bellybelly.com.au/baby-sleep/rolling-onto-baby-while-cosleeping/) of their babies in order to avoid smothering them.
1.7.5. Con: Sharing a bed with your baby allows you to be more responsive to some important health signals, such as being more aware of baby's apnoea \(breathing pauses\).
1.7.6. Con: There are [practical steps](https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a558334/co-sleeping-and-safety) that can be taken to make co-sleeping safer, such as using a firm mattress and light bedding.
1.7.7. Con: Alternatives to sleeping on the same bed as the baby are also dangerous.
1.7.7.1. Pro: It is [safer](https://www.mdedge.com/jfponline/article/62492/sleep-medicine/what-are-safe-sleeping-arrangements-infants) for a baby to cosleep than to sleep in a room separate from caretakers.
1.7.7.2. Pro: Cribs can be [dangerous](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/news/20110216/cribs-frequent-cause-of-injury-for-babies-toddlers#2) too. It is harder to notice and respond to dangers such as suffocating, overheating, falling out and getting wedged or stuck.
1.8. Pro: Attachment parenting is a natural way of parenting.
1.8.1. Con: Attachment parenting being "natural" does very little to support it being the "best" method.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Johnson's, a major company focused on children's products, recently highlighted that [safety is more important than what's natural.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kavinsenapathy/2017/06/08/safety-more-important-than-following-the-natural-is-best-trend-says-johnsons-baby/#ee97a65372ac)
1.8.1.2. Pro: According to researcher Paul Rozin, people [intuitively believe](https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-preference-for-natural/) natural is necessarily better, despite very little supporting evidence.
1.8.1.3. Pro: Many things that are natural, such as [cancer, poisons, and natural disasters](http://piecubed.co.uk/appeal-to-nature-natural/) are objectively harmful despite their natural status.
1.8.1.4. Con: In the context of child-rearing, being 'natural' actually does give the method merit. This is because evolution has done the hard work of trial and error, and has arrived at the [best-yet](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/james-mckenna-co-sleeping-expert_b_7119782.html) method.
1.8.2. Pro: The alternative to breastfeeding is infant formula, the production of which is a multistage [process](https://bodyecology.com/articles/baby_formula_health_risks.php) potentially prone to mistakes. At best, infant formula is an imperfect mimic of natural breast milk.
1.8.2.1. Pro: The American Academy of Pediatrics \(AAP\), the American Medical Association \(AMA\), and the World Health Organization \(WHO\) all [advocate](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/breast-bottle-feeding.html) for breast-feeding over using formula.
1.8.3. Pro: There is [anthropological research](https://www.parentingscience.com/attachment-parenting.html) which demonstrates that many practices associated with natural parenting, such as baby-wearing and co-sleeping, have deep roots in our evolutionary past.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Humans are mammals, closely related to bonobos and chimps. The study of mammals is enough to see that a mother's instinct is supported by hundreds of millions of years of descent.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: Co-sleeping is an [inseparable component](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057899/) of maternal care in other mammals, especially our closest relatives apes and monkeys.
1.8.3.2. Pro: Jean Liedloff studied the [Ye'kuana people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye%27kuana) and wrote an influential book on parenting \([The Continuum Concept](http://www.continuum-concept.org/cc_defined.html)\) in which she argues for many of the same principles as attachment parenting on the premise that infants, unlike adults who have experienced a kind of evolution to come to depend on the provisions of the modern world, do not rely on any of the technological advances, and therefore need more pre-modern approaches to parenting.
1.8.3.3. Pro: [Ethnopediatrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnopediatrics) has been influential in promoting the benefits of attachment parenting, especially with the publication of [Our Babies, Ourselves](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/407854.Our_Babies_Ourselves) by Meredith Small, in which she argues for attachment parenting on the basis of cultural insights into traditional societies.
1.8.4. Pro: Crying is a [simple and efficient signal](https://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/week-10/decoding-cries.aspx) of need or discomfort in babies, which parents are intuitively driven to respond to.
1.8.5. Pro: By ensuring care is completely responsive to the child, AP reflects every natural process a child goes through and is thus an instinctively natural way of caring for a child.
1.8.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.5.
1.9. Pro: Attachment parenting is beneficial for the mother.
1.9.1. Pro: Attachment parenting creates a unique, special and intimate bond between child and mother.
1.9.1.1. Pro: A mother's sensitivity to infant signals is [significantly related](http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-55579-001.html) to secure attachment of that infant to that mother. The closer the connection of the mother with the child, the better the mother can understand the needs of the child.
1.9.1.2. Pro: In the Dogon culture who breastfeed on demand, hold their infants a large portion of the time, respond quickly to crying, and co-sleep, 87% of infants were found to be [securely attached](http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-55579-001.html) to their mothers, in contrast to 65% of infants in American households. Attachment parenting clearly fosters a better overall relationship between mother and child.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: This assumes that 'secure attachment' is the optimum; psychologically speaking, the concept of attachment was formed and primarily tested in the USA, which has an individualist culture. In China and Japan - with collectivist cultures - 'insecure' attachments were the norm. The concept is [culturally biased](https://www.simplypsychology.org/culture-attachment.html), which pressures the idea that AP is best for child-rearing.
1.9.1.2.2. Con: There are vast ways in which Dogon society and norms differ from those in America. It is unlikely that the focus on attachment parenting is the sole factor influencing the different rates of secure attachment in these two cultures.
1.9.1.3. Pro: Intimate [social bonding](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/happiness_is_being_socially_connected), especially with family, is a major factor in happiness, benefitting both mother and child.
1.9.2. Con: The subservience of a mother's needs to that of her child's is only feasible to a point; whilst the child may benefit, the mother may lose all sense of independence.
1.9.2.1. Pro: The mother must be [available](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/the-perils-of-attachment-parenting/375198/) for breastfeeding 24/7. If this is to occur, the mother cannot maintain her own independent schedule, or even sleep for more than two hours straight, but must act simply on the whims of her child.
1.9.2.2. Pro: The inability to tend to one's own needs ends up [harming](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/the-perils-of-attachment-parenting/375198/) the child as well. Parents are at their best when they've taken care of themselves - when they've had a decent night's sleep, when they've had a chance to connect with their partner, and when they've had the opportunity to move around baby-free. Otherwise, the mother is simply frustrated and tired, and may take out the frustration on the child.
1.9.2.3. Pro: Attachment parenting excludes working mothers.
1.9.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.2.2.
1.9.2.4. Con: An infant is totally dependent on someone responsive to its needs.
1.9.3. Con: Constant breastfeeding, child holding, lack of sleep training and other AP behaviours are likely to make a mother [exhausted](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/lynn-shattuck/a-mothers-needs-the-downs_b_4697608.html); 'mainstream' baby rearing is challenging enough.
1.9.4. Pro: Breastfeeding acts as a natural contraceptive due to hormonal changes that result in [lactational amenorrhea](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/breastfeeding).
1.9.5. Con: -> See 1.4.4.
1.9.6. Pro: Extended breastfeeding has positive health effects on the mother.
1.9.6.1. Con: D-MER \(Dysphoric milk ejection reflex\) causes some women to get [depressed](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/i-hated-breastfeeding-but-not-for-the-reason-you_us_58cac68ce4b07112b6472b77) because they breastfeed.
1.9.6.1.1. Con: The fact that rare conditions exist where it is not a positive experience, or even possible to do, does not undermine the positive effects of breastfeeding in general.
1.9.6.2. Con: [Breastfeeding](http://www.healthywomen.org/content/ask-expert/1371/breastfeeding-causing-diminished-sexual-desire) will probably diminish the mother's [libido](https://www.hersolution.com/info/breastfeeding-and-libido-what-your-doctor-doesnt-tell-you-about-sex/).
1.9.6.3. Con: Breastfeeding can have negative health effects on the mother too, like [breast and nipple pain](http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/breastfeeding-benefits-and-disadvantages).
1.9.6.4. Pro: Extended breastfeeding reduces the risk of multiple types of cancer for the mother: [breast](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12704674?dopt=Abstract), [ovarian](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361371/), [uterine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2956020/) and [endometrial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4517025/).
1.9.6.5. Pro: Extended breastfeeding can help mothers [lose weight](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8338042).
1.9.6.6. Pro: Extended breastfeeding reduces the risk of [osteoporosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22295033), [rheumatoid arthritis](https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/53/5/860/1798220), [cardiovascular disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19384111) and [type II diabetes](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/33/6/1239) for the mother.
1.10. Con: Attachment parenting has detrimental effects on the relationship of the parents.
1.10.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.10.3. Pro: The intense demands of attachment parenting \(especially in time, scheduling constraints and money\) make it less likely the parents will be able to focus on cultivating their own relationship.
1.10.3.1. Pro: If a mother must always be available for breastfeeding, it makes scheduling dates or leaving for longer parent-only trips or activities more difficult.
1.10.3.2. Con: Some people see children as an important goal of matrimony, investing more in offspring than in cultivating the relationship with a partner.
1.10.3.3. Con: All parenting - attachment parenting or not - puts a strain on parents' relationship with each other.
