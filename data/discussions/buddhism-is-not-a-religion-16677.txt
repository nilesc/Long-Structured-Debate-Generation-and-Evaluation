Discussion Title: Buddhism is not a religion.

1. Buddhism is not a religion.
1.1. Pro: Religion is [defined](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/religion) as "the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods." Buddhist philosophy technically doesn't have a god. However, in its evolution into religion, Buddha is seen and prayed to in god like fashion today.
1.1.1. Con: Going by the definition [provided](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/religion), parts 1.1 and 1.2 of the definition of religion were skipped. The first uses the definition of "a particular system of faith and worship and the second "a pursuit or interest followed with great devotion". As such, Buddhist philosophy does fulfill the other parts to the definition provided and it is thus a religion.
1.1.2. Con: Buddhist refer to supernatural beings as devatā "deity" and devaputra "son of the gods." [¹](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Deva#Devas_in_Buddhism) - In Mahayana Buddhism the universe is populated with celestial buddhas and bodhisattvas who are worshipped as gods and goddesses. The historical Buddha is honored in this way, but most other Buddhist deities are adapted from the cultures Buddhism has encountered, from the Hindu pantheon in its home culture of India to the indigenous religions of Tibet, China and Thailand. [²](http://www.religionfacts.com/buddhism/gods)
1.2. Con: This discussion seeks to define religion through a single criterion: belief in a God as conceived of by another religion. This is an absurd criterion.
1.3. Con: Buddhism has definite religious beliefs.
1.3.1. Pro: Buddhism is a Religion since it has practices to obtain Enlightenment.
1.3.2. Pro: Buddhism subscribes to the Anatman theory, according to which the self, the thinker of thoughts and doer of deeds, does not exist.
1.3.3. Pro: Buddhism involves a belief in rebirth.
1.3.4. Pro: Buddhism believes in various supernatural races of beings.
1.3.5. Pro: Buddhism subscribes to a very specific cosmological model involving different worlds.
1.3.6. Pro: Buddhism subscribes to the existence of Siddhis or magical powers acquired through meditation.
1.3.7. Pro: There are paranormal claims about the world in bhuddism just like in any other religion. For example the existence of hell-spirits and reincarnation and the contact to the spirit world through idols.
1.3.8. Pro: Bhuddism is consisting of traditional and communal activities that involve beliefs about certain supernatural claims about the world wich generate meaning for bhuddists. This is one of the signs of it being a religion.
1.3.9. Pro: If a religion is often determined by the belief in the supernatural, as such, Buddhism is a religion since it has a clear belief system on the afterlife.
1.4. Pro: God is not mentioned in Buddhism.
1.4.1. Con: Shinto religion doesn't have a god either.
1.4.1.1. Con: Shintoism can also not be considered a religion.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: "Because ritual rather than belief is at the heart of [Shinto](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/shinto/beliefs/religion.shtml), Japanese people don't usually think of Shinto specifically as a religion - it's simply an aspect of Japanese life".
1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Japanese people think this way because of the Western concept of religion- [Shinto, to them, doesn't fit the Western concept, so to them it does not appear to be a religion, even though it is.](http://www.greenshinto.com/wp/2011/08/14/is-shinto-a-religion/)
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Japanese Shinto is a Syncretic Religion. [¹](https://www.britannica.com/topic/religious-syncretism) [²](http://science.jrank.org/pages/11386/Syncretism-Syncretism-in-World-Religions.html) [³](https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/bible/bible-general/syncretism)
1.4.1.2. Con: Shintosim doesn't have a god, but it does have "[gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kami)" \(e.g. Amaterasu, the "sun god," considered one of the most powerful\).
1.4.1.3. Con: Shinto reveres location-based spirits. They could be considered "gods" depending on the used definition of the term.
1.4.2. Con: One [definition](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/religion) of religion is "a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects". While Buddhism does not have a god head, it still fits the definition of a religion.
1.4.3. Pro: Most religions do have some sort of god.
1.4.3.1. Pro: All religious views belong to one of following three groups: [Agnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism); [Atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism) and [Theism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theism). The first position is the belief that existence of God is unknowable, the second is based on the belief in the lack of God, and the third is based onthe belief in the existence of God. Therefore, if Buddhism can be considered a religion, then Atheism could also be a considered a religion.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Atheism isn't a religion.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: They believe that \(any\) God doesn't exists. 
It is kind of belief .
1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Con: A belief is not the same as a religion.
1.4.3.1.1.1.2. Con: However, [atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism) lacks the organized practices, rituals set of morals or tenets to follow as well as the belief in the supernatural to be considered a [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion).
1.4.3.1.2. Con: Many new age religions would then also not be considered religions.
1.4.3.1.3. Con: There are others. One example being [Deism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism). A deist is someone who believes that a supreme being, who remains unknowable and untouchable, created the universe, and then abandoned it based on rational grounds. Hence the supreme being has no control over the natural phenomena occurring in the universe. - In short: A supreme being appeared, created, departed, and no longer has any relevance. [¹](http://www.differencebetween.info/difference-between-theist-and-deist)
1.4.3.1.4. Pro: Atheism could be considered a religion.
1.4.3.1.4.1. Pro: Atheism seeks to answer the same questions that all religions answer. Is there a plan or purpose in the universe? What is right and wrong? Is there life after death? Etc...
1.4.3.1.4.2. Pro: Atheists take many unprovable postulates on faith, the same as any religion.
1.4.3.1.5. Con: There are three major generalized worldviews, known as [theism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theism), [pantheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism), and [atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism). Buddhism falls under pantheism as a shared worldview, where as Christianity falls under theism.
1.4.3.1.6. Con: The statement that Atheism is “a belief in the lack of God” is incorrect. The statement has transposed two of the words from a correct definition, changing the meaning to an incorrect one. A more correct statement is that Atheism is the lack of a belief in God. This statement covers all atheists. However, only a subset of these atheists covered by that statement also have a stance that goes further, believing there is no God.
1.4.3.2. Pro: In most religions, God is able to save believers. Buddha, on the other hand, offers teachings but individuals need to work on themselves to fin enlightenment and [salvation](http://www.buddhanet.net/nutshell03.htm).
1.4.4. Con: A single all-powerful God is not mentioned in Buddhism. But many gods and supernatural beings are part of traditional Buddhist thought.
1.4.5. Con: The idea that a religion needs to deal with God explicitly may be a reductive Westerner view.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Religion is not inherently a belief in God, as this is a common conception about religion in general. There are plenty of religions within the pantheistic worldview perception that do not necessarily believe in God, and arguments against God are not inherently a position against religion, but in particular, to theistic worldviews.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Buddhism, is a religion. It has a belief in the afterlife, a set of principles to live by, and you put faith in the Buddha for helping you find your path. Buddhism asks that you to have faith in yourself, and your path in life. Unlike western religions it does not require a follower to have blind faith, but an open view and open mind of the world.
1.4.6. Con: -> See 1.3.9.
1.4.7. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.4.8. Pro: [By definition,](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/religion) a religion needs a God or gods. Buddhism doesn't have gods, therefore it can't be considered a religion, it's more a way of life.
1.4.8.1. Pro: If a religion is defined as the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods, Buddhism is not a religion. Buddhism is a spirituality.
1.5. Pro: It is philosophy of behaviour in every day life .
1.5.1. Pro: Buddhism shows that a moral beliefs system does not need a "God".
1.5.1.1. Con: Buddhism teaches that there are supernatural consequences to moral behavior. Therefore it hardly supports the idea that morality does not require supernatural or otherwise religious foundation.
1.5.1.2. Con: Ethical systems do not require a "god." Secular ethics has existed for thousands of years. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_ethics)
1.5.2. Con: Philosophy is based on reasons, fact and observations and religion is based on faith. By those definitions, Buddhism is a religion since it requires faith.
1.5.3. Pro: Unlike other religions, the lack of dogma, brings Buddhism closer to a philosophy than a religion.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Personal moral principles are above any kind of dogma and Buddha's teachings are not meant to be divine and immutable laws.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: The [Four Noble Truths](https://www.lionsroar.com/what-are-the-four-noble-truths/) are the central principles of Buddhism and considered to be immutable natural laws.
1.5.3.2. Con: Dogma is not necessary for something to be a religion [\(e.g. Shintoism\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto).
1.5.3.3. Con: [Buddhism](http://www.sapphyr.net/buddhist/buddhist-core.htm) has [dogma](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dogma).
1.5.3.3.1. Con: [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_\(Buddhism\)) does not demand blind belief and allow for a vast continuum of interpretations. It embraces the individual's path to truth and makes it clear that dogma does not supersede personal conscience and experience.
1.5.3.3.1.1. Con: The path is till guided by basic tenets and doctrines \(which are fundamental to the idea of dogma in terms of religion\).
1.5.3.3.1.1.1. Con: The key difference is that in most religions, dogmas are doctrines that are “[unquestionably true](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dogma)” and generally “[authoritatively proclaimed](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dogma)”. If a religion has tenets but they are not mandatory or unquestionable, one can consider them not dogmatic.
1.5.3.3.1.2. Pro: When a person takes on [The Five Precepts](https://tricycle.org/magazine/the-five-precepts/), they are left to the rationalization and justification of the individual. Example: The First Precept is to abstain from taking life. Is it ethical to take the life of one person who is intent on taking the life of another? The individual has to decide and live with the consequences of such decision.
1.5.3.3.2. Con: Buddhism, for example, does not provide strict and unanimous moral teachings on issues like [abortion](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml), [death penalty](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/capitalpunishment.shtml) or [euthanasia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/euthanasiasuicide.shtml).
1.5.3.3.2.1. Pro: Buddhism has never held views against [homosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_and_sexual_orientation) and Buddha's teachings do not condemn non-reproductive [sex](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/contraception.shtml).
1.5.3.3.2.1.1. Con: Buddhism doesn't specifically make statements about sex other than to "not misuse" sexuality.
1.5.3.3.3. Pro: The [Pāli Canon](http://palicanon.org) is certainly [dogma](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dogma) in both definition 1 and 2. The Canon is a central authority and foundational to Buddhism.
1.5.4. Con: It is a doctrine[¹](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/doctrine) based on philosophical theology[²](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_theology) and a dogma[³](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/dogma)representative of Buddhist sociological ideology.[⁴](https://www.gemass.fr/IMG/pdf/IESBS-ideology_sociology_of_.pdf)
1.6. Con: Many people are considering Buddhism as a religion
1.6.1. Pro: Buddhism is a religion; opinions have been made that it is an "ethical teaching" more than it is a religion, which is agreeable to some extent, since not all Buddhism are the same and differs in beliefs and practices at some level.
1.6.2. Con: A majority of people agreeing on something is not a necessary conditions for that something to be true.
1.6.2.1. Con: [376 million](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/10/06/the_odd_body_religion/) people believing that Buddhism is a religion and practicing it as a religion, definitely makes it more than just a philosophy.
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.2.
1.7. Con: [Buddhism](https://www.infoplease.com/us/major-religions-world/buddhism) is considered one of the major and [most practiced religions](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/10/06/the_odd_body_religion/) of the world.
1.7.1. Pro: There are two aspects to religion, that include [dogma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogma), and [spirituality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality). A religion does not have to hold both aspects. Buddhism lacks in dogmatic principles as compared to theistic worldviews, but flourishes in spirituality.
1.7.1.1. Con: Spirituality is not sufficient to characterize religion. A non-religious atheist person can develop spirituality, even with no beliefs.
1.7.1.2. Con: "Dogma" does not require belief in God.
1.7.1.3. Pro: Buddhism lacks a dogmatic aspect because there is no official mention of God, as dogma is a set of principles of authority, and there is no authority within Buddhism, or any pantheistic worldview for that matter. That is what sets pantheism apart from theism.
1.7.1.3.1. Con: "Dogma" means the fundamental teachings of a religion. Though Buddhists don't specifically use the word, their fundamental teachings \(including the lack of a creator God\) could be called "dogma".
1.7.2. Pro: Buddhism [has many sects](https://archive.artsmia.org/art-of-asia/buddhism/buddhist-sects.cfm) with widely different belief systems and practices and cannot be lumped together under one umbrella.
1.7.2.1. Con: The same could be said for Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: The various sects of Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism all have shared pantheons. Not all sects of Buddhism even agree that gods and devils exist, they therefore cannot be grouped together in the same way.
1.8. Con: There are monks and temples in Buddhism similar as in other religions
1.8.1. Con: Ancient Greek philosophers such as [Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates) and [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras) had brotherhoods of scholars and [places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_Academy) to discuss [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_philosophy) similar to religions.
1.8.2. Pro: [Japan has many such temples.](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2058.html)
1.9. Pro: Atheism and Bhuddism share the same belief in the lack of God.
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.9.2. Con: Buddhism makes no statement about the existence of God, but rather a statement about fundamental principles of reality.
1.10. Con: Probably the buddhists consider Buddhism as a religion.
1.10.1. Con: One can opt in and out of Bhuddism. For example, attending Bhudda's Birthday celebrations in Korea makes one part of Bhuddism even though one has a different denomination otherwise.
1.10.1.1. Con: It isn't attendance at festivals that make one a Buddhist, any more than singing Handel's "Messiah" at Christmas time make one a Christian. It is a combination of accepting the [Three Jewels](https://tricycle.org/magazine/etymology-three-jewels-2/) and the [Five Precepts](https://tricycle.org/magazine/the-five-precepts/) that "make" one a Buddhist.
1.10.2. Con: To most practicing Buddhist, they are allowed other faiths, if they are following the teachings. There is nothing wrong in following another deity if it helps in the attainment of Nirvana
