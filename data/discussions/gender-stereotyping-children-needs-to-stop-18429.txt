Discussion Title: Gender stereotyping children needs to stop

1. Gender stereotyping children needs to stop
1.1. Con: Protecting children from gender stereotyping is difficult.
1.1.1. Pro: Social institutions, such as the Scouts, separate between genders.
1.1.1.1. Con: [The BSA is now allowing girls into their programs.](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/02/607678097/boy-scouts-changing-name-to-scouts-bsa-as-girls-welcomed-into-program)
1.1.2. Pro: Social interactions at kindergarten or school primes children.
1.1.3. Con: Providing a gender neutral space at home will make the child aware of the difference in the public.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The pressure created by institutions outside of the home make a safe space all the more important.
1.1.4. Con: The end of gender stereotyping will take major reform across a wide spectrum of social institutions, but it will be worth it for the equality it brings with it.
1.2. Pro: Gender stereotyping promotes a society where segregation is acceptable.
1.2.1. Pro: In any society where two groups are expected to have mutually exclusive interests, segregation - and all the negative repercussions thereof - will undoubtedly propagate.
1.2.2. Con: Gender is inherent to the way we view ourselves and each other. It is far better to address it explicitly from a young age so that people can grow up understanding the way they are viewed.
1.2.2.1. Con: Gender is informed by the way society [views](https://othersociologist.com/sociology-of-gender/) a person's sex. It is not inherent, rather it is constructed by those around us. There is no a priori need to labour these stereotypes on children.
1.2.3. Pro: Single sex schools, sports clubs and extra curricular activities from a young age encourage segregation.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Spending so long divided on the basis of gender creates [harmful](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/single-sex-schools-offer-no-advantages-and-feed-stereotypes-psychologists-told) opinions of the opposite gender.
1.2.4. Con: Single sex education is steadily declining in [popularity](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/03/single-sex-schools-could-disappear-from-australia-within-20-years-study). The recognition of differences between sexes does not necessitate segregation.
1.3. Con: Gender stereotypes are not constraints, but recommendations. It gives a place to start for a child in finding who they are, instead of being confused and clueless.
1.3.1. Con: Many trans youth are forced into the confines of one gender by society. By removing things like color coding by gender we can reduce social pressure on trans or gender-nonbinary youth.
1.3.2. Pro: Parents send a clear message of acceptance and love to their children. The fact that they might give footballs to boys and dolls to girls does not prevent children from expressing alternate interests.
1.3.3. Con: Suggestions of specific behaviors, interests, etc. of someone based strictly off their gender is gender stereotyping. It is the same as racial stereotyping, or age stereotyping.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Just like age or race, individuals cannot select what gender they present as at birth. Thus, it is just as discriminatory to treat some differently based on what gender they appear to be.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Gender is not determined by sex, or the physical way a person is born. Thus it is not like race or age in that people can say what gender they are for themselves, regardless of the lottery of birth.
1.4. Con: Men and women are different.
1.4.1. Con: Biologically, there are at least [five](https://www.fd.unl.pt/docentes_docs/ma/TPB_MA_5937.pdf) sexes. Dividing society into two is an arbitrary and artificial exercise.
1.4.2. Pro: Trans children as young as five [know](https://www.vox.com/cards/transgender-myths-fiction-facts/transgender-children-too-young-fiction) their gender. We should listen to them, support them, and treat them as the gender they identify as. This requires applying some stereotyping.
1.4.2.1. Con: This may be true for some youth, but for many people it can take a lot longer.
1.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.
1.4.2.3. Con: Simplistic stereotypes of only two genders do not reflect the wide [spectrum](https://www.parentmap.com/article/gender-identity-sexuality-civil-rights) of gender identities that people experience. Thus, they are unhelpful to letting people develop their true gender identity.
1.4.3. Con: Being different does not necessitate stereotyping, especially if those stereotypes are ultimately harmful.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Being biologically different does not mean that we should perform certain roles according to our gender, especially if they are discriminatory.
1.4.4. Pro: Men and women have different brains and are genetically different. Gender stereotypes are based on these biological facts.
1.5. Pro: Gender stereotyping produces negative economic consequences.
1.5.1. Pro: Business may not reach a large portion of the potential market because they have propagated stereotypes.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Gender stereotyping in the video game industry has [led to major business not reaching women in marketing.](https://www.appnova.com/video-games-marketing-women/)
1.5.2. Pro: A stereotype of men being the sole or primary breadwinners leaves out a huge portion of the potential labor force.
1.5.2.1. Pro: When employers are [biased](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/why-employers-favor-men) towards male candidates, it means that they will not pick the best person who will perform their role to the most profitable standard.
1.5.3. Pro: The vast [pay gap](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43129339) between men and women negatively impacts the sustainability of different workplaces.
1.5.4. Con: In adults; this isn't salient to a discussion about gender stereotyping children.
1.5.4.1. Con: The treatment of children dictates how they will act later in life. Our conception of gender is [taught](https://www.genderspectrum.org/quick-links/understanding-gender/) to us in our youths.
1.5.5. Con: 45% of the U.S. workforce is [female](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sl.tlf.totl.fe.zs). Gender stereotypes are not preventing women from entering the workforce.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Women in the UK are up to a [third](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/aug/28/university-gender-gap-at-record-high-as-30000-more-women-accepted) more likely to attend college than their male counterparts. This suggests that more and more women will enter the labour force in the future.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: Women have outnumbered men in university for over forty years. [Despite](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-women-professional-inequality-college/) this, they are systematically excluded from positions of power in the working world.
1.5.5.2. Con: At the same time women constitute to 51% of the US population \([data from 2017](https://www.statista.com/statistics/737923/us-population-by-gender/)\), so there is 6% gap between expected and actual part of women in the workforce.
1.6. Con: Gender differences need to be celebrated.
1.6.1. Con: There is no particular reason to celebrate gender as a defining feature.
1.6.2. Con: They can be celebrated without media enforced stereotyping.
1.6.3. Pro: Many languages are themselves [gendered](https://bostonlanguage.wordpress.com/2015/01/09/gender-in-languages-across-the-world/). it is difficult and confusing to engage with such a gendered society without a lived understanding of what it means.
1.6.4. Pro: Being raised without gender can make forming a sense of self more [difficult](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/26/how-important-is-gender).
1.6.4.1. Con: It is a larger concern that we might impose gender stereotypes on a child that do not correspond to the identity that they feel.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Being mis-gendered can have devastating effects on a person. As many as [78%](http://www.teni.ie/page.aspx?contentid=673) of trans people have contemplated suicide.
1.6.4.1.2. Con: As few as [0.58%](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/transgender-population-in-us/) of Americans identify as transgender. This means that the risk harms very few people.
1.6.4.1.2.1. Con: Even accepting that percentage, the harm extends to a substantial number of people. Based on the current [U.S. population](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/us-population/), 0.58% amounts to close to 2 million individuals. What's more, transgender individuals are not the only people who are affected.
1.7. Pro: Sexism in the workplace would disappear.
1.7.1. Con: A conversation around gender roles form a young age allows us to critique oppressive and mysogynistic behaviour.
1.7.1.1. Con: One in [five](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/25/two-five-women-have-sexually-harassed-workplace-poll-shows/) women have been sexually harassed in the workplace. These behaviours have not been addressed effectively.
1.7.1.2. Pro: It is necessary for everyone to understand gender in detail in order to embrace a more nuanced view that avoids bigotry.
1.7.2. Con: Sexism in the workplace is a completely unrelated topic.
1.7.2.1. Con: Growing up with strong reinforcements of interests based on gendered socialization leads to women being turned off from traditionally masculine careers.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: Associating skills like programming with men [has contributed](https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/519426/how-did-tech-become-so-male-dominated/) to a [massive gender gap](https://www.businessinsider.com/statistics-prove-men-dominate-tech-world-2013-7) in the tech sector.
1.7.2.2. Pro: Misogyny and disrespect towards woman are not part of childhood stereotypes such as wearing blue and liking sport.
1.7.2.3. Con: If men and women were conditioned without systemic misogyny, pursuing different careers and being successful in them would be possible.
1.7.2.3.1. Pro: Setting different rules for boys and girls at a young age leads to different expectations of men and women in adulthood. This can lead to double standards.
1.7.2.3.1.1. Pro: The word "bossy" is a good example: girls are criticised while boys are commended for being more dominant/controlling.
1.7.2.3.1.2. Pro: Children also internalise these expectations. Because women are taught not to be dominant, they are far less likely than men to, for example, ask for a pay [raise](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/04/women-are-still-not-asking-for-pay-rises-here-s-why/).
1.7.2.3.2. Pro: Gender stereotyping at a young age leads to a "otherization" of women by men and a resulting lack of empathy.
1.7.2.3.2.1. Pro: Stereotypes that define male as the opposite of female creates [myths](http://savisyouth.org/gender-identity/) which hurt both boys and girls.
1.7.2.3.2.2. Con: This forgets how much young children interact with people of the opposite gender. The fact that they are conditioned to act a certain way does not stop them befriending and respecting those of the opposite gender.
1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.3.
1.8. Pro: Children would be free to discover more talents.
1.8.1. Pro: Imposing femininity on girls has numerous negative effects on their lives.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Growing up being told that they are girls affects the way that young women act and how they physically hold themselves. [Young p 139](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/special/transnational/iris_marion_young.pdf)
