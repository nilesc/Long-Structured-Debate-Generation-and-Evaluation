Discussion Title: Darwinian evolution is philosophy not science.

1. Darwinian evolution is philosophy not science.
1.1. Con: Science of evolution is well established.
1.1.1. Pro: There are [endless studies](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=science+of+evolution&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart) to back this up.
1.2. Con: Darwinian evolution is a scientific theory, very defective \(structuralism is preferable over functionalism\), but a theory. However, the fact that some people conclude philosophical things about Darwinism does not make Darwinism a philosophy, it is still science.
1.2.1. Pro: Science is defined by objective testability. Any idea that can be scientifically tested is a hypothesis. Any hypothesis that can stand the test of time is a theory. Thus Darwinian Evolution IS a theory that is inside the realm of science.
1.3. Con: Natural selection is a well established scientific fact.
1.3.1. Pro: Natural selection has endless [scientific studies](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=natural+selection+scientific+journal&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart) to support it.
1.4. Pro: Unobserved events with no experimental backup are only philosophical ideas.
1.4.1. Con: Science does not always have experimental evidence to support its claims.
1.4.1.1. Pro: The strength of a [Scientific Theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theories) \(as opposed to a general theory or "philosophy"\) is related to the diversity of Phenomena \(i.e that which is actually happening in Human experience\) it can explain and its simplicity. As additional knowledge is gained on the phenomena, a scientific theory may be modified, strenghtened or even ultimately rejected if it cannot be made to fit the new findings.
1.4.1.2. Con: Science always has empirical evidence to support its theories.
1.4.2. Pro: A theory may sound scientific but without experimental backup is really philosophy based on assumptions.
1.4.2.1. Con: A theory in science is very different to the colloquial definition of a theory.
1.4.3. Con: While this is strictly true, where there is a reliance on [abductive reasoning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning) , a theory is still Scientific if there is no abandonment of the effort to test the reasoning against what can be observed so far, and build really large machines to [make the unimaginable, observable](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-the-higgs-boson-was-found-4723520/)
1.4.4. Con: You don't have to directly observe an event to be able to assess if it really occurs. [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes) never needed to travel into space to acknowledge that Earth is round.
1.4.5. Pro: Science deals with what we can test and observe. If I come up with a theory that theory, however well grounded in sound reason, still must be tested in order for it to be accepted as scientific fact. Einstein would not be the genius that we regard him as today if his theories of gravity affecting the path of light or time dilation were never observed. His theories would have died. The only reason Darwin's theory still survives is because humanity likes the idea of no divine moral accountability.
1.5. Pro: Any idea that tries to answers questions of existence belongs to the realm of philosophy.
1.5.1. Con: An idea can belong to philosophical realm but still be scientific.
1.6. Con: A science makes a testable claim which must be established by observable evidence. Evolution proposes the argument that organisms have adapted over time in order to survive in their chosen/imposed environment. This claim has numerous examples of observational evidence. It is also falsifiable, there is nothing in this theory that makes it impossible to criticize, unlike creation science, which claims to be infallible
1.7. Pro: No single example of evolution has ever been documented.
1.7.1. Con: Numerous examples of change to a species have been observed.
1.7.1.1. Con: The changes are from the variation which already existed in the DNA coding.
1.7.1.2. Pro: The fossil record, genome, comparable anatomy and many other avenues of reasoning lead to the conclusion that all life is related.
1.7.2. Pro: Changes observed are the result of pre-existing genetic specifications.
1.7.2.1. Con: There is no proof to that.
1.7.2.2. Con: That is an opinion with little merit as evolution rarely happens in a moment of time, rather over many years of observation. We have seen animals modify their diet and as such modified their digestive and eating abilities. Some birds are a perfect example of this.
1.7.3. Con: There are many ongoing experiments that are expanding knowledge of the science of biological evolution. Here is one that has been going for [30 yrs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment). All of them have demonstrated Darwins mechanism.
1.7.4. Con: Spontaneous mutation has given us the [Poodle-Cat](https://www.ibtimes.com/poodle-cat-new-cat-breed-discovered-scientists-1319077) - the conditions of the human home are good for this evolution, it will keeping multiplying and be fruitful.
1.8. Con: Numerous examples of evolutionary change have been documented.
1.8.1. Pro: [This spans](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/her/evolution-and-natural-selection/a/lines-of-evidence-for-evolution) anatomy through molecular biology to simply observing lifeforms with short life spans.
1.8.2. Pro: There are numerous well established family trees of evolutionary development.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Here is an example of an [insect family tree](https://www.livescience.com/48663-insect-family-tree-evolution.html) of evolutionary development.
1.9. Con: Scientific theory with lots of consistent evidence is science fact.
1.10. Pro: Creation is a better explanation of the facts than evolution.
1.10.1. Con: Though the amount by which the discrepancy is present varies from creation account to creation account, most creation accounts contain unverifiable claims \(existence of a god etc.\), logical inconsistencies \(light shining on Earth before Sun invented etc.\) and disconnect from currently accepted science \(age of the Earth etc.\)
1.10.2. Con: Creation requires creator. Evolution does not, so the evolution is by [Ockham's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) a better explanation.
1.10.2.1. Con: Evolution is not the simpler answer, compared to Creationism. Apart from trying to comprehend mind boggling timescales of millions of years, it means we have to also consider the origins of the Universe, which are equally [beyond human experience](http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-origin-of-the-universe.html).
1.10.2.1.1. Con: Creationism requires understanding of even more complex reality - such that requires a transcendental Creator, and a timeless scale in which it exists. This concept is far more incomprehensible: what is a million of years compared to infinity?
1.10.3. Con: Explaining something better doesn't necessarily bring us any closer to the truth. The whole point of science, although imperfect and sometimes even fallible, it enables progress in the sense that it produces further questions. This is unlike creation, which has a "concrete" answer for everything that cannot be argued against which is the exact opposite of what science should be
