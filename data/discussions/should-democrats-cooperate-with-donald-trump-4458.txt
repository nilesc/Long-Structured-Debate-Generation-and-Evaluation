Discussion Title: Should Democrats Cooperate with Donald Trump?

1. Democrats should not cooperate with Donald Trump’s presidency.
1.1. Pro: Allowing Trump to claim to be a bipartisan President strengthens his political stature.
1.1.1. Con: These concessions can have political gain too: distancing Trump from his traditional Republican supporter base hurts his political position and divides the opposition the Democrats will face in 2018 and 2020.
1.1.2. Con: Democrats [condemned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/26/democrats-gop-plot-obstruct-obama) Republicans for unwarranted obstructionism aimed at [hurting](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/republican-party-obstructionism-victory-trump-214498) Obama's political standing; it would be hypocritical of them to do the same now.
1.1.2.1. Con: This assumes that obstructions faced by Trump are unwarranted, whereas this may not be the case.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Trumpcare](https://www.thebalance.com/how-could-trump-change-health-care-in-america-4111422) and executive orders that alter Obamacare would raise costs faster than Obamacare and would prevent millions from accessing healthcare. Opposition to such a plan is by no means unwarranted.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Cooperating with Trump makes him [appear](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/20/opinions/democrats-cooperate-trump-zelizer/index.html) to be just like any other Republican president, something he is not given the themes of xenophobia, sexism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia prominent in his campaign.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Other Republican Presidents were just as problematic as Trump but Democrats cooperated with them.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: George Bush's administration [falsified intelligence](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/9/12123022/george-w-bush-lies-iraq-war) to justify an invasion of Iraq and failed to help the [black community in New Orleans](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/9495294/ns/us_news-katrina_the_long_road_back/t/hurricanes-are-over-issue-race-lingers/) after Hurricane Katrina.
1.1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: George H. W. Bush utilized [racist attack ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io9KMSSEZ0Y) to help stir up fear to beat Mike Dukakis.
1.1.2.1.2.1.3. Con: Even if one assumes that George H.W. Bush and Donald Trump are equally bad, saying that Democrats have done this in the past does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that they should do it now.
1.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: It is precarious to cooperate with someone who has demonstrated [no regard for the truth](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/statements/byruling/false/) or his moral obligations.
1.1.2.1.2.3. Pro: Donald Trump is considered the most [ableist](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-perry-trump-ableism-20161017-snap-story.html) presidential nominee in modern American political history.
1.1.2.1.2.4. Pro: Donald Trump’s [campaign](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/president-donald-trump-racist-examples_us_584f2ccae4b0bd9c3dfe5566), like his real estate business, was built upon [racism](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/trumps-long-history-of-racism-w497876).
1.1.2.1.2.5. Pro: Donald Trump’s election campaign was based on racist and xenophobic practices, such as [anti-Mexicanism](http://time.com/4473972/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-insult/) and [Islamophobia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/20/i-think-islam-hates-us-a-timeline-of-trumps-comments-about-islam-and-muslims/).
1.1.2.1.2.6. Pro: Donald Trump has a well-documented [history](https://www.vox.com/2016/10/8/13110734/donald-trump-leaked-audio-recording-billy-bush-sexism) of misogyny, sexism, and [harassment](https://www.thecut.com/2016/10/all-the-women-accusing-trump-of-rape-sexual-assault.html).
1.1.2.1.2.6.1. Con: The "well-documented" claim is hardly proof of misogyny, but rather private trash talk. Many individuals talk in a similar manner with friends and acquaintances, hence many people overlooked the tape. It's juvenile behavior but this is a moral argument, not an ethical one. The women who accused Trump of harassment [dropped those claims](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit-dropped-230770), which leads many to believe that the claims were false or a political stunt.
1.1.2.1.2.6.1.1. Con: Just because many other individuals talk in a similar manner does not make the manner any more acceptable. Trump's words were still misogynistic and degrading to all women.
1.1.2.1.2.6.1.1.1. Con: A good many women do not believe so if they were [willing to vote for him](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/09/28/millions-of-american-women-disagree-with-michelle-obama-donald-trump-is-their-voice/?utm_term=.c4e3dd35f404). Morality is different from person to person.
1.1.2.1.2.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Women can internalise misogyny and perpetuate patriarchy as well. Them supporting a sexist person does not make the person not sexist.
1.1.2.1.2.6.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It's a bit inappropriate to paint 53% of the women who voted for him as having "internalized misogyny" or are self-hating. Them supporting a perceived sexist probably means they don't believe he is sexist. Hence their sense of morals are different to others.
1.1.2.1.2.6.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Whether they believe he was sexist or not is irrelevant to the fact that his comments were degrading to all women.
1.1.2.1.2.6.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Studies](http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/08/07/why-some-women-support-sexism_a_23067811/) have found that women can actually internalise misogyny and believe in sexism.
1.1.2.1.2.6.1.2. Con: Trump has been accused by at least [16 women](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/27/donald-trump-sexual-harassment-claims-women-lying-white-house) of sexual harassment. This isn't just "locker room talk", Trump is likely a predator.
1.1.2.1.2.6.1.3. Con: This claim says "women", while the cited article mentions one woman. The article also states that the accuser claims to have been harassed in order to silence her suit. Whether in private or in public the utterances in question represent a sexist and misogynistic mindset. Indeed, the legal threshold that an accuser must meet in order to convict the accused is arguably an impediment to a victim's access to justice and a method by which the power of the accused is maintained.
1.1.2.1.2.7. Pro: Democrats have a [responsibility](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/harry-reid-is-not-going-to-pretend-that-electing-donald-trump-is-ok) to be the voice of the millions of Americans who feel like they are not welcome in Trump's America. By cooperating with Trump, they tacitly endorse his insults.
1.1.2.1.2.8. Pro: Trump ran on a campaign of implicit white nationalism. Cooperating with him [sanctions](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/the_democrats_are_already_screwing_up_the_trump_resistance.html) tribalism as a legitimate political strategy, a strategy that is antithetical to liberal pluralist democracy.
1.1.2.1.2.8.1. Pro: Trump defended white nationalists as '[very](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-defends-white-nationalist-protesters-some-very-fine-people-on-both-sides/537012/) [fine](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/15/politics/donald-trump-david-duke-charlottesville/index.html) [people](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/trump-charlottesville-white-nationalists.html?_r=0)' during the Charlottesville protests.
1.1.2.1.2.8.1.1. Con: Trump's comments were being [misrepresented.](https://www.vox.com/2017/8/15/16154028/trump-press-conference-transcript-charlottesville) He said that there were "very fine people on many sides" and correctly pointed out that there were some people who were not affiliated with the white nationalists who simply didn't want the historical monuments taken down. It's disingenuous to conflate this as a defense of white nationalists.
1.1.2.1.2.8.1.2. Con: Trump has [condemned white nationalists](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/14/politics/donald-trump-charlottesville-resolution-white-supremacy/index.html) [and Antifa](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/15/politics/trump-charlottesville-delay/index.html) which is just as bad as the white nationalists. Just because Trump rightfully condemned both groups doesn't mean he supports white nationalism.
1.1.2.1.2.8.1.2.1. Con: Some of Antifa's actions may be morally questionable, but to claim that it is as bad as white supremacists is [blatantly untrue](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/what-trump-gets-wrong-about-antifa/537048/).
1.1.2.1.2.8.1.2.1.1. Pro: There are numerous accounts of Antifa protesters saving the lives of other more traditional, peaceful protesters at [Charlottesville](https://itsgoingdown.org/antifa-saved-their-lives-report-from-clery-at-charlottesville/). This indicates that sometimes the violence they deploy is necessary to protect people, which cannot be said of the far-right.
1.1.2.1.2.8.1.2.1.2. Pro: Of at least 372 murders that were committed by domestic extremists between 2007 and 2016, according to a study by the Anti-Defamation League, 74 percent were [committed by right-wing extremists](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/theories-meaning-trump-many-sides-remark.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&login=facebook). Muslim extremists were responsible for 24 percent of those killings, and the small remainder were committed by left-wing extremists.
1.1.2.1.2.8.1.2.1.3. Pro: Members of Antifa are, at worst, [anarchists](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/theories-meaning-trump-many-sides-remark.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&login=facebook), which is an impractical ideology, but it is not the same as believing that one group of people are inherently superior to another, or that America belongs to only one group, which is what white nationalists believe in.
1.1.2.1.2.8.1.2.1.4. Con: Antifa and other "resistance" movements have [assaulted](https://www.rt.com/usa/401119-berkeley-far-right-rally-protest-arrests/) individuals for the very purpose of [shutting down discussion](https://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/08/14/violent-antifa-protesters-try-to-shut-down-pro-trump-patriot-prayer-rally-in-seattle/) and perpetuating hysteria. This alone already violates free speech laws and thus, Antifa is a direct threat to individual's rights.
1.1.2.1.2.8.1.2.1.5. Con: Antifa is dangerous enough to have been declared a [domestic terrorist group](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/antifa-domestic-terrorists-us-security-agencies-homeland-security-fbi-a7927881.html) by the US Government.
1.1.2.1.2.8.1.2.1.5.1. Pro: The FBI [defines](https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005) domestic terrorism as the “unlawful use, or threatened use, of force or violence by a group or individual based and operating entirely within the United States or Puerto Rico without foreign direction committed against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof in furtherance of political or social objectives.” Antifa's members often attempt to influence policy through mob violence and can be declared terrorists.
1.1.2.1.2.8.1.2.1.6. Con: Antifa itself [promotes attacks on conservatives](http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/06/21/antifa-website-promotes-violence-against-trump-supporters-says-capitalism-causes-death) on their website.
1.1.2.1.2.8.2. Pro: 31% of the American population believe Trump [supports](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-poll-white-nationalism-support-charlottesville-alt-right-more-americans-believe-president-in-a7896981.html) white nationalism, while only 24% believe he is personally opposed to it.
1.1.2.1.2.8.2.1. Con: The polls are coming from sources such as Huffington Post which hasn't revised its methodology since the 2016 prediction debacle, but even then only a minority of individuals believe Trump supports white nationalism. [40% of people agree that both sides were the problem.](http://dailycaller.com/2017/08/18/poll-shows-nearly-half-of-americans-agree-with-trump-about-charlottesville/)
1.1.2.1.2.8.3. Pro: [Steven Bannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon#Political_career), chief executive of Donald Trump's presidential campaign and former chief strategist and senior counsellor in the White House, ran Breitbart news, an organisation he proudly called the '[platform for the alt-right](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/magazine/breitbart-alt-right-steve-bannon.html)'.
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.1. Con: The conservative publication has [pushed back](http://thehill.com/media/347266-breitbart-pushes-back-on-alt-right-label) against the label that it is alt-right.
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.1.1. Con: Regardless of what Bannon has said since coming under fire, Breitbart has certainly given extremely favourable coverage to the alt-right, including this [glowing profile of the movement](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/29/an-establishment-conservatives-guide-to-the-alt-right/) written in 2016.
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.1.1.1. Pro: Racist people can claim that they are not racist, that does not change the fact that they are. A buzzfeed [expose](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/10/06/breitbart-expos%C3%A9-confirms-far-right-news-site-platform-white-nationalist-alt-right) of the inner workings of Breitbart solidifies the far-right outlet’s reputation as a platform for the white nationalist “alt-right.”
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.2. Pro: Under Bannon's leadership, the site published an article that [celebrated](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/29/an-establishment-conservatives-guide-to-the-alt-right/) the work of several white supremacists, including Richard Spencer, who was one of the leaders of the Charlottesville rally and who made [headlines](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/alt-right-salutes-donald-trump.html?_r=0) for using Nazi slogans and gestures at a Washington celebration of Trump's inauguration.
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.3. Pro: Bannon has [reportedly praised](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/03/16/steve_bannon_is_at_it_again_and_by_it_we_mean_nazism.html) a far-right French writer named Charles Maurras who was sentenced to life in prison after World War II for collaboration with Nazi occupiers.
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.4. Con: The alt-right is [not a monolithic or cohesive movement](https://therationalists.org/2016/03/23/an-honest-look-at-the-alt-right/) and in fact has many different groups within that range from moderate to extremist viewpoints. It is therefore not appropriate to conflate Bannon with the more extremist group.
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.4.1. Con: The article linked in the above claim itself states that the most common thread running through the alt-right is white nationalism. Even if Bannon does not associate with the most extreme alt-right tendencies, it is still fairly damning that he would associate with such an ideology at all.
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.4.1.1. Con: White identitarianism is of course no different from the other identitarian movements that surged out of the left. When even one group begins an identitarian movement based on race, like Black Lives Matter, then the logical conclusion would be that everyone will want an identitarian movement as well including white people. The fact is that Bannon is [not willing](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40958329) to associate himself with the farther right wing movements, it is therefore unfair to categorize him as such.
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.4.2. Con: Bannon has [repeatedly and publicly endorsed](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/03/06/steve_bannon_and_the_camp_of_the_saints.html) The Camp of the Saints, a novel popular in white-pride circles in which black Americans, "dirty Arabs," and feces-eating Hindu rapists \(among others\) destroy civilization.
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.4.2.1. Con: He never endorsed it, not even in the link provided, he simply mentions it as an analogy for the crisis in Europe.
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.4.2.1.1. Con: He [compared](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/03/06/steve_bannon_and_the_camp_of_the_saints.html) the refugees flooding to Europe as feces-eating, dark-skinned immigrants overrunning "the white world." It's not about endorsing the book as much as it is about being explicitly racist and white nationalist.
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.4.3. Con: When "[moderate](http://This type of assistance will not necessarily always be readily accessible or affordable to suffering women.)" views include racial purity, antisemitism, and "white genocide" then they're not really moderate at all. The alt-right exists on a spectrum from extreme to very extreme viewpoints.
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.4.3.1. Pro: Many segments of the alt-right do fear a white genocide or at the very least [racism against white people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp0uq-QafYQ).
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.5. Con: Bannon was [eventually fired](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/steve-bannon-chief-strategist-breitbart-forced-out-resigned-fired-president-donald-trump-white-house-a7901841.html) from his position in the White House.
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.5.1. Con: Bannon was fired [due to](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/18/16145188/steve-bannon-fired-resigns) internal friction with other members of the administration, not his white nationalist beliefs.
1.1.2.1.2.8.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.8.3.4.2.
1.1.2.1.2.8.4. Pro: Trump and his administration have extensive connections with members of the alt-right movement, a movement he refuses to condemn.
1.1.2.1.2.8.4.1. Pro: Alex Jones advocates paranoid beliefs of all sorts, included [alt-right-adjacent theories](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/02/27/white_house_apparently_sends_press_release_to_alex_jones_anti_semitic_infowars.html) about the "Jewish mafia" and "globalists," such as the Rothschilds, who manipulate world events to enrich themselves. Trump called Jones "amazing" during a 2015 interview, and the White House [confirmed](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/02/21/trump_and_alex_jones_in_contact_white_house_seems_to_acknowledge.html) to the New York Times that Trump and Jones occasionally speak on the phone.
1.1.2.1.2.8.4.1.1. Pro: Alex Jones peddles all sorts of [conspiracy theories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ePLkAm8i2s).
1.1.2.1.2.8.4.1.2. Con: Alex Jones has never really identified himself as Alt-Right and even [confronts them](https://www.infowars.com/alex-jones-confronts-leader-of-the-alt-right-race-riot/) from time to time. He's merely a popular and entertaining conspiracy theorist.
1.1.2.1.2.8.4.2. Pro: Julie Kirchner was appointed to work at the federal Office of Citizenship and Immigration Services by the Trump administration in May. She was previously the executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an organisation that has complained that [immigration undermines whites' dominance](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/05/01/trump_immigration_ombudswoman_julie_kirchner_fair_white_supremacy_eugenics.html).
1.1.2.1.2.8.4.2.1. Con: FAIR is a liberal organization that advocates for [centrism](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/us/17immig.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0) on the immigration issue. Its founder John Tanton, didn't oppose immigration [based on race](http://but population growth put ever more pressure on the land.), he opposed immigration due to the idea that overpopulation would lead to exploitation of natural resources.
1.1.2.1.2.8.4.3. Pro: Dan Scavino, assistant to the president and director of social media, regularly uses Twitter to [push](https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2016/12/22/trump-brings-his-slimy-social-media-director-dan-scavino-white-house/214901) anti-semitic conspiracy theories.
1.1.2.1.2.8.5. Con: Trump ran on a populist message of tax reform, Obamacare repeal, border security, immigration reform, and hard stance against Islamic terrorism. It is unfair to associate and elevate far right fringe groups as the explicit voice of his campaign when [far left](http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/08/16/former-clinton-campaign-spokesmans-antifa-comparison-might-just-make-you-nauseous) [fringe groups](http://theduran.com/hillary-clinton-exposed-redirected-800k-from-campaign-to-antifa/) were also [supporting](http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-black-lives-matter-activist-endorses-1477486400-htmlstory.html) [Hillary Clinton](http://www.jpost.com/US-Elections/Clintons-foreign-policy-team-of-social-justice-warriors-447298).
1.1.2.1.2.9. Con: If Trump's platform is explicitly racist, Democrats should focus on moderating his proposed legislation by cooperating with him, in order to minimise the harmful impact of the legislation.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1. Con: Cooperation with Trump is bound to fail; Democrats should focus on forming a policy platform which they can run on in 2018 and 2020.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.1. Pro: The divisions between Republicans and Democrats on fundamental political values – on government, race, immigration, national security, environmental protection and other areas - has reached [record heights](http://www.people-press.org/2017/10/05/the-partisan-divide-on-political-values-grows-even-wider/) under Trump. There is very little room for cooperation to begin with.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.1.1. Con: Revamping America’s outdated tax code and modernizing its run-down infrastructure are [progressive causes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/opinion/why-democrats-should-work-with-trump.html) Democrats should support. They have been elected to pass useful policy, not to prevent its creation altogether.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2. Pro: Democrats do not need support from Trump's base to win the [2018 election](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-dont-need-trumps-voters-to-retake-the-house/). It is unreasonable to risk harm to the party and its legislative agenda when there is no considerable benefit to be derived.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1. Pro: Granting Trump legislative victories will simply make it harder for Democrats to win mid-term elections in 2018 and the White House in 2020.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1. Pro: Trump currently has an [approval rating](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/) of less than 40%, a historically low approval rating amongst recent US Presidents. By staying away from Trump, Democrats can use that low approval rating to win future elections.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Polling has proven to be [unreliable](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/what-went-wrong-polling-clinton-trump/507188/). Making strategic decisions based on such results may not be the smartest political move.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Trump is [likely to win](https://theconversation.com/trump-will-likely-win-reelection-in-2020-77362) in 2020, regardless of what the Democrats do, so any impacts on his popularity should not matter to the Democrats.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Parties usually spend at least 8 years in office. [Since 1932](http://campuspress.yale.edu/davidmayhew/files/2013/05/mayhew_incumbencyadvantage_2008.pdf), there has only been one instance of a party spending less than 8 years in office.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Historically, [less than half](http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/09/politics/btn-second-term-presidents/index.html) of all US presidents won a second term. Even if Republicans win in 2020, Trump can still lose the primaries.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Polls from [late April 2017](https://theconversation.com/trump-will-likely-win-reelection-in-2020-77362) suggest that if the election had been held then, Trump would not only have won again, but also won the popular vote. This is despite his declining approval rating.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.3. Pro: If Democrats lose in the next election cycle, then this staunch opposition would have been for nothing. It would have prevented certain beneficial policies from passing without anything to show for it.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.4. Con: Even if Trump will win his next term, lowering his popularity is still good for Democrats.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.4.1. Pro: The lower President Trump's approval numbers get, the worse his claim to a mandate becomes.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.4.2. Pro: If Trump's approval numbers climbed higher, then Democrats in conservative leaning states would feel immense pressure to vote with him in Congress.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: In fact, the Governor of West Virginia [switched parties](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/08/03/west-virginias-governor-is-switching-parties-and-democrats-just-hit-a-new-low/?utm_term=.0546794452fa) to become a Republican.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: The Governor was [previously](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/03/politics/west-virginia-gov-republican-democrat/index.html) an independent and then a Republican up until 2015, so he is hardly indicative of what the average Democrat would do.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.4.2.2. Pro: Democrats in states Trump won in 2016 faced [considerable abuse](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-in-states-won-by-trump-feel-pressure-ahead-of-vote-on-neil-gorsuch/) when they decided to vote against Trump's supreme court nominee Neil Gorsuch.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.4.3. Pro: If Trump turns out to be a severely unpopular president, this strengthens the Democrats' mandate when they next come into power.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.4.4. Pro: If the popularity of Trump - and by extension the Republican Party - is lower, then Democrats will have a better chance of winning midterm elections.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.5. Con: Hillary Clinton had very [low approval ratings](http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-poll-numbers-after-216-election-2017-7). Democrats can field candidates in 2020 that are likely to be more successful than Clinton.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.6. Con: Trump's approval rating is [incredibly low](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/25/trump-approval-rating-fox-news-244181), and continuously declining.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.6.1. Pro: More Americans disapprove of President Donald Trump's job performance than approve of it across [31 states](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/26/politics/trump-approval-underwater-11-states/index.html), including 11 that voted for him. If his popularity continues to decline or remains as is, it is unlikely that he will win the 2020 presidential election.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.6.2. Con: Trump's approval rating remains high among Republicans, at [78%](http://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx), and has remained broadly stable since July.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.6.2.1. Con: There has been a roughly [10% drop](http://www.newsweek.com/do-republicans-trump-latest-polls-show-base-slipping-approval-rating-plunges-715748) in the approval rating of Trump amongst Republicans during the month of November. This support is likely to continue to dwindle, increasing the chances of primary challengers.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.7. Pro: Incumbents enjoy a significant advantage in US presidential elections. \([Mayhew, p. 212](http://campuspress.yale.edu/davidmayhew/files/2013/05/mayhew_incumbencyadvantage_2008.pdf)\)
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.7.1. Pro: Challengers often have to build name recognition, which can be a difficult task.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.7.1.1. Pro: This is especially true given President Trump's [disproportionate coverage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/how-that-nations-largest-owner-of-tv-stations-helped-donald-trumps-campaign/2016/12/22/02924864-c7af-11e6-8bee-54e800ef2a63_story.html?utm_term=.32c54843dcca) by the media.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.7.2. Pro: Delegates and other party figures are unlikely to support a primary challenger if doing so risks losing favour with the incumbent once they win.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.7.2.1. Con: This logic applies equally to supporting the incumbent, as supporting the incumbent may risk losing favour with the challenger were they to win.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.3. Con: While polls of all adults in America show Trump's political future to be bleak, polls of [registered and likely voters](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-polls-differ-on-trumps-popularity/) show the country split roughly half in half for and against Trump, same as before election day in 2016. It is not true that Trump will lose the next election by virtue of just being unpopular.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.2. Pro: Refusal to cooperate will affect Trump's behaviour in desirable ways for the Democrats.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: If Trump's agenda is obstructed, he will become angry and erratic, and more likely to take radical measures which will undermine his popularity.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.2.2. Con: If Democrats obstruct Trump, he will not see himself as a potentially bipartisan President, and will be more likely to embrace Republican orthodoxy.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Given Trump brought Steve Bannon into the White House, wanted to repeal Obamacare, and is intent on passing tax cuts for the rich, it is safe to say that Trump was never intending on acting as a bipartisan President.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.3. Pro: Trump is [losing support](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-ruralamerica-poll/trumps-popularity-is-slipping-in-rural-america-poll-idUKKBN1CE15S) in rural America, a key constituency for him in the 2016 election, for failing to act on immigration. By cooperating with Trump, Democrats risk boosting Trump's support.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Democrats [have cooperated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/09/13/trump-top-democrats-agree-to-work-on-deal-to-save-daca/) with Trump to secure better legal status for Dreamers. If Trump's base is being alienated by his actions on immigration, then cooperating with him for more generous immigration policy is precisely the way to undermine his support.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.4. Pro: Moderates [tend not to be ideological](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/05/moderates-who-are-they-and-what-do-they-want/370904/) in nature, so instead they tend to gravitate towards candidates that seem more productive or successful.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Moderates are likely to be alienated by parties that refuse to have bipartisan cooperation.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: [Republicans](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/republican-party-obstructionism-victory-trump-214498) were extremely obstructionist during Obama's terms in office, but the electorate tends to blame the party in charge for failing to pass policies.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The less Trump seems to be someone who can get things done, the [less](https://hbr.org/2017/02/if-democrats-want-to-challenge-trump-they-need-a-new-strategy) his marginal voters will believe in him. That is the key to defeating Trump in the next election.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.5. Con: 66% of Democrats want [cooperation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/11/14/morning-plum-democrats-want-compromise-republicans-dont-thats-bad-for-democrats/?utm_term=.e9dc83cb8f4a) with Republicans. Not cooperating is likely to harm the Democrats more than cooperating.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.5.1. Pro: If traditional Democrats are less enthusiastic about the party, Democratic turnout in midterm elections, which [is already low](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/upshot/democrats-are-bad-at-midterm-turnout-that-seems-ready-to-change.html), will likely worsen even more.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.5.2. Con: Refusing to cooperate with Trump is different from refusing to cooperate with the Republican Party. Recent [bipartisan bills](https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/19/honest-ads-acts-facebook-google-twitter-ads-regulated/) have shown that lawmakers can refuse to cooperate with Trump but still get [support](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/03/robert-mueller-senate-bills-protection-241296) from the other side of the aisle.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: The Congress [overwhelmingly passed](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/russia-sanctions-trump-house-passes-bill-putin-kremlin-a7860191.html) a bill to put sanctions on Russia for instance, despite opposition from Trump.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.6. Con: Cooperating with Donald Trump on certain issues where Republicans are divided, such as healthcare reform, could prompt Republican infighting that ultimately strengthens the position of the Democrats in Congress.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.7. Con: Not cooperating on mutually agreeable issues will cause the Democrats to look like a hindrance to the country at large and its ability to operate, decreasing their popularity while increasing Trump's.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.7.1. Pro: It was by making a deal with Trump that the Democratic party [protected](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/daca-deal-or-no-deal-trump-democrats-dreamers/539784/) Dreamers; without cooperation, these immigrants could be at risk of being kicked out of the country.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.2. Pro: Trump's [approval ratings](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/) have consistently declined and continue to do so. Supporting such a President will not lead to more public support. In fact, it may lead to a loss of support.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.1.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3. Con: Democrats need to win back some of Trump's base in order to win the next election, primarily rural areas and the white working class.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.1. Pro: [9.2%](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/upshot/the-obama-trump-voters-are-real-heres-what-they-think.html?_r=0) of previous Obama voters voted for Trump.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.2. Pro: Clinton lost the election in part because of [key shifts in support](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/upshot/the-obama-trump-voters-are-real-heres-what-they-think.html?_r=0) from white voters in swing states.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Whites without four-year college degrees make up [fully half of the adult population](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/opinion/democrats-virginia-jersey-victory.html?WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region&_r=0&action=click&clickSource=story-heading&emc=edit_ty_20171113&module=opinion-c-col-right-region&nl=opinion-today&nlid=76391954&pgtype=Homepage&region=opinion-c-col-right-region&te=1). Giving up on the white working class is bound to result in electoral failure for the Democrats.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.3. Con: At least [eight state legislature](https://www.vox.com/2017/11/7/16619800/2017-election-virginia-governor-northam) seats flipped from Republican to Democrat in the 2017 special elections, with none going the opposite direction, including a Democratic win in [Georgia](https://www.vox.com/2017/11/7/16622128/georgia-election-results-state-senate), which voted for Trump in the presidential election. Democrats are already winning over Trump's base, they do not need to co-operate.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.3.1. Con: A few state legislature elections are not necessarily indicative of Democrats' chances in the presidential election 3 years from now.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.3.2. Con: This is not true. The Democratic victories occurred [almost](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/opinion/democrats-virginia-jersey-victory.html?WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region&_r=0&action=click&clickSource=story-heading&emc=edit_ty_20171113&module=opinion-c-col-right-region&nl=opinion-today&nlid=76391954&pgtype=Homepage&region=opinion-c-col-right-region&te=1) entirely in areas that had voted for Hillary Clinton last year.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.3.2.1. Pro: Only [one](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/opinion/democrats-virginia-jersey-victory.html?WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region&_r=0&action=click&clickSource=story-heading&emc=edit_ty_20171113&module=opinion-c-col-right-region&nl=opinion-today&nlid=76391954&pgtype=Homepage&region=opinion-c-col-right-region&te=1) of the 15 districts that flipped from Republican to Democratic had voted for Trump. Republicans largely held the Trump districts, which let them keep control of the Virginia House of Delegates, 51 to 49.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.3.2.2. Con: In virtually every House special election this year Democrats over-performed, by [a large amount](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/28/politics/state-legislative-elections-annette-tadeo-kari-lerner/index.html), Hillary Clinton's 2016 showing in these congressional seats.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.3.3. Pro: Of the 27 Republican-held state legislative seats that have come open in 2017 to date, Democrats have now flipped [almost 30%](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/28/politics/state-legislative-elections-annette-tadeo-kari-lerner/index.html) of them, a remarkable number under any circumstance but especially so when you consider the average Trump margin in these seats in 2016 was 19 points.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.3.4. Con: Each of these races have unique dynamics. In the [Florida race](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/28/politics/state-legislative-elections-annette-tadeo-kari-lerner/index.html), the seat was open because the Republican incumbent was forced to resign after making racist comments to several black lawmakers at a bar in Tallahassee. It's not exactly easy to run as a Republican in the district in the wake of that sort of scandal.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.4. Pro: Democrats cannot rely exclusively on metropolitan cities to win elections. As the recent governor election in Virginia shows, Democrats [lose](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/opinion/democrats-virginia-jersey-victory.html?WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region&_r=0&action=click&clickSource=story-heading&emc=edit_ty_20171113&module=opinion-c-col-right-region&nl=opinion-today&nlid=76391954&pgtype=Homepage&region=opinion-c-col-right-region&te=1) outside of the big metropolitan areas, and badly so. Without appealing to the white working class that Trump won, Democrats will lose future elections.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.5. Pro: If Democrats give up on the white working class people that voted for Trump, they effectively [forfeit](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/opinion/democrats-virginia-jersey-victory.html?WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region&_r=0&action=click&clickSource=story-heading&emc=edit_ty_20171113&module=opinion-c-col-right-region&nl=opinion-today&nlid=76391954&pgtype=Homepage&region=opinion-c-col-right-region&te=1) Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin, all of which are now Republican. This is hardly the foundation of a successful future electoral strategy.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6. Con: Appealing to Trump voters is futile. Democrats are better off focusing on other groups.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.1. Con: 44% of Obama-Trump voters are currently [undecided](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/opinion/how-democrats-can-extend-the-winning-streak-into-2018.html?em_pos=small&emc=edit_ty_20171113&nl=opinion-today&nl_art=5&nlid=76391954&ref=headline&te=1). While it may be difficult, it is clearly possible to convince these undecided voters to vote Democrats.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.2. Pro: Trump voters [lean culturally to the right](https://newrepublic.com/article/143519/culture-became-main-fault-line-american-politics). Unlike economics, there is little room to bargain or negotiate over identity and culture, making any appeal to Trump voters futile.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.2.1. Con: Arguably the left has become racist, if not hostile, towards white people and males, hence why the majority of white people feel [victimized by racism](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/24/559604836/majority-of-white-americans-think-theyre-discriminated-against). Such racism and hostility, from flat out telling white people that their way of life should [die out](http://dailycaller.com/2016/03/12/national-review-writer-working-class-communities-deserve-to-die/), to telling them to "[check their privilege](http://www.theroot.com/yes-you-can-measure-white-privilege-1794303451)", is arguably what gave [rise to white identitarian](http://thefederalist.com/2016/05/23/how-anti-white-rhetoric-is-fueling-white-nationalism/) groups and a new "culture war". The left merely has to cut back on some of it's anti-white rhetoric to make even a slight change in it's favor.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.2.2. Pro: The white working class is in fact more likely to vote Democrat, and was more likely to vote for Clinton rather than Trump, if it had voted on economic concerns. The fact of the matter is that this part of the electorate is motivated far more by [concerns about cultural displacement](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/9/15592634/trump-clinton-racism-economy-prri-survey) than they are by economic concerns, making such a fight futile.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3. Pro: A slim majority \(51%\) of white working-class Americans [identify with or lean toward](https://www.prri.org/research/white-working-class-attitudes-economy-trade-immigration-election-donald-trump/) the Republican Party, whereas only one-third \(34%\) say the same for the Democratic Party. The Democrats face an uphill battle.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3.1. Con: Trump focuses on the 'white' part of white working-class, appealing to cultural issues. If Democrats instead focus on the 'class' part by offering a coherent economic message, they can win over this group of voters.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3.1.1. Pro: The landslide victories for ballot initiatives on [Medicaid](http://www.pressherald.com/2017/11/07/medicaid-expansion-campaign-goes-down-to-the-wire/) and the [minimum wage](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/11/minimum-wage-2016/507158/) indicates that the white working class is progressive when it comes to economics. Democrats can defeat Republicans if they focus on putting forward progressive economic policies.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3.1.2. Pro: Most swing voters lean [notably left](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/opinion/how-democrats-can-extend-the-winning-streak-into-2018.html?WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region&action=click&clickSource=story-heading&emc=edit_ty_20171114&module=opinion-c-col-left-region&nl=opinion-today&nlid=76391954&pgtype=Homepage&region=opinion-c-col-left-region&te=1) on economic policy. It’s true of people who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 but not Hillary Clinton in 2016 and even of those who switched from Mitt Romney in 2012 to Clinton in 2016. This is something Democrats have an edge over Republicans on.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3.1.3. Pro: While Clinton adopted a [centrist](https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21722838-democrats-want-become-again-working-peoples-party-donald-trumps-america) position on the economy in 2016, Trump moved [further left](https://www.npr.org/2016/07/01/484284763/trump-s-position-on-trade-often-aligns-with-left-wing-economists) than she did to appeal to economic woes of the working class. There is no reason why Democrats can't take back the economic left.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3.1.3.1. Pro: Now that Trump is [breaking](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/319134-sanders-trump-backtracking-on-every-economic-promise-that-he-made) most of his economic promises, Democrats can convince voters that they will follow through on progressive economic policies.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3.1.3.2. Pro: While Trump campaigned on an economically left position, mainstream Republicans won't, allowing Democrats to win those voters concerned about the economy in 2018.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3.1.4. Con: Trump is going to make all future elections about culture. Democrats not only [lose](https://newrepublic.com/article/144092/trump-wants-culture-war-democrats-ready-fight-back) the fight when it comes to cultural issues, but are likely to lose the white working class if Trump succeeds in making the election about culture rather than the economy.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3.1.4.1. Pro: Clinton's argument in 2016 that Democrats’ social and cultural values were “American values” [did not work](https://newrepublic.com/article/144092/trump-wants-culture-war-democrats-ready-fight-back) - nonwhite voters didn’t show up in great enough numbers, and white voters went for Trump in record numbers.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3.1.4.2. Pro: In the 2016 election, fears about immigrants and cultural displacement were [more powerful](https://www.prri.org/research/white-working-class-attitudes-economy-trade-immigration-election-donald-trump/) factors than economic concerns in predicting support for Trump among white working-class voters.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3.1.4.3. Pro: White working-class voters who favored deporting immigrants living in the country illegally were 3.3 times more likely to express a [preference](https://www.prri.org/research/white-working-class-attitudes-economy-trade-immigration-election-donald-trump/) for Trump than those who did not. Yet Democrats are moving [further left](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/18/16458164/democrats-daca-border-security-schumer-pelosi) on immigration.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3.1.4.4. Pro: Nearly two-thirds \(65%\) of white working-class Americans believe American culture and way of life has [deteriorated](https://www.prri.org/research/white-working-class-attitudes-economy-trade-immigration-election-donald-trump/) since the 1950s. Democratic progressivism, at its core, is about changing American culture to include everyone, as opposed to Republican conservatism, which is about maintaining the status quo.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3.1.4.5. Pro: More than seven in ten \(71%\) white working-class Americans [identify](https://www.prri.org/research/white-working-class-attitudes-economy-trade-immigration-election-donald-trump/) as Christian. Democrats' position on issues such as abortion make it [difficult](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/21/where-major-religious-groups-stand-on-abortion/) for them to tap into this group.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3.1.4.6. Pro: The Left won the old culture wars, which arguably focused on civil rights, but the new culture wars typically revolve around [Freedom of Speech,](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/opinion/liberals-free-speech.html) and the left will always lose if it argues against this right.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3.1.5. Con: The Democrats will not focus on "class" when time after time they themselves have [focused on race](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/page/ct-perspec-page-identity-politics-democrats-20170905-story.html), even when it isn't necessarily the issue.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.3.1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.6.2.2.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.3. Con: Forty-four percent of Republicans and those who lean Republican prefer leaders to [compromise](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/laurettabrown/2017/10/09/gallup-more-americans-prefer-leaders-compromise-rather-than-stick-to-principles-n2392603) and just 23 percent prefer that leaders stick to their beliefs. Trump, as a Republican, will listen to his base, and therefore cooperate.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.3.1. Pro: 54 percent of Americans in general preferred [compromise](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/laurettabrown/2017/10/09/gallup-more-americans-prefer-leaders-compromise-rather-than-stick-to-principles-n2392603) and just 18 percent wanted leaders to stick to their beliefs even if little gets done. Trump has little reason to go against public opinion here.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.3.2. Con: Trump's [declining](http://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx) approval rating among Republicans and independents indicates that he is not that responsive to popular preferences.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.3.2.1. Con: The "declining" approval ratings from his base were caused in part [due](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-ann-coulter-impeachment-tweets-daca-immigration-compromise-democrats-a7947436.html) to his compromises with the Democrats themselves, particularly when it came to DACA. Trump is willing to compromise in good faith even if it hurts his standing with his base, but the opposition party isn't.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Trump's approval rating among Republicans actually rose to a [brief peak](http://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx) when the [DACA deal](https://www.vox.com/2017/9/13/16305690/top-democrats-announced-daca-deal-trump) was making headlines; so in fact cooperating with Democrats may have increased his popularity among Republicans, by making him look more effective.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The brief peak \(September 14\) was before his base knew what the deal comprised of, as nothing was set in stone at the time. As details of the deal came to light in the following weeks, it was clear that the deal was a bad one to Trump's base hence the fall off in [Sept 25 - Oct 29](http://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx). But with Trump reiterating that the deal must include [border security](http://abc13.com/politics/trump-denies-daca-deal-made-with-dems/2413969/), along with the recent terror attacks, support from his base will likely increase once again. His quick response shows he is receptive to his base.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.3.3. Pro: Trump's [core supporters](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bowmanmarsico/2017/06/23/who-were-donald-trumps-voters-now-we-know/#2e9605733894) are a relatively bipartisan group, many of whom voted Democrat in the past. They are likely to support cooperation with Democrats.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.3.1.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.3.3.2. Pro: Trump's core supports are also [unlikely to abandon him](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41028733) no matter what he does, so he does not need to worry much about their wishes.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.4. Pro: Standing up to President Trump and refusing to cooperate shows a united front and brings together a party which was heavily divided during the 2016 primaries.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.4.1. Con: It is a bad sign - in general, and to the voters - if Democrats can only be united by obstructing a Republican President.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.4.1.1. Con: Uniting to obstruct is better than not being able to unite at all.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.4.1.2. Pro: Democrats need to build up a unified positive message, rather than merely presenting themselves as the negation of Trump.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.4.1.3. Con: Obstructionism as a [political strategy](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/republican-party-obstructionism-victory-trump-214498) got Republicans the House in 2010, the Senate in 2014, and the White House in 2016. There is no reason why it should not work for Democrats either.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.4.2. Con: A policy of obstruction is unlikely to be universally loved by all Democrats, and would likely generate internal division.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.4.2.1. Pro: The Democratic Party [already lost voters to Trump](http://time.com/voices-from-democratic-counties-where-trump-won-big/). Obstructing his presidency risks losing more.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: The Democrats are at risk of losing moderates, swing voters and party radicals who want to 'shake up' Washington.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.4.3. Con: Showing unification of resistance against cooperation does not reflect well on Democrats.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5. Con: There is no particular reason why Democrats cannot both attempt to cooperate with Trump and form independent policy to run on in 2018 and 2020. These are not mutually exclusive.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1. Pro: Attempting to cooperate with Trump and Republicans will allow them to develop policy that is more bipartisan, and more likely to propel them to success in the future.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1. Pro: If Democrats pursue their own policy goals independently, without cooperation from Republicans, then their resulting legislative agenda will be more radical.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Even as Republicans try to replace Obamacare, Democrats are [internally beginning to support](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/healthcare-congress-bernie-sanders-single-payer-obamacare/533595/) singlepayer healthcare.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Democrats are simply responding to clear voter preferences: two in three Democratic voters \(65%\) say that a single-payer healthcare system is a "[good idea](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/30/politics/single-payer-democrats-support/index.html)," and 49% of overall Americans [support](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/americans-dems-support-single-payer-health-care-poll-article-1.3509035) the system while just 35% oppose it.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.1.2. Con: The bulk of Senate Democrats still [do not](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/12/16293016/sanders-single-payer-health-care) support single-payer healthcare.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.1.3. Pro: The number of Democratic senators supporting single-payer healthcare is [rapidly increasing](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/12/16293016/sanders-single-payer-health-care): from 0 Senators two years ago, 11 Senators now back Bernie Sander's single-payer healthcare bill.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.2. Con: Democrats are aware of what they need to do to win elections, and will moderate their own legislation independently if necessary.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.2.1. Con: Past records suggest that Democrats do not always recognise what is necessary to win elections. The Democratic National Convention [conspired](http://observer.com/2016/07/wikileaks-proves-primary-was-rigged-dnc-undermined-democracy/) against Bernie Sanders, who may have had a [better chance](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/357937-trump-pollster-sanders-would-have-defeated-trump-in-the-presidential) at winning the presidential election.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.2.1.1. Con: While members of the DNC were opposed to the candidacy of the Vermont senator, there is no actual proof that they [interfered](https://www.thenation.com/article/what-the-leaked-e-mails-do-and-dont-tell-us-about-the-dnc-and-bernie-sanders/) with the Democratic primary.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Recent [admissions](http://dailycaller.com/2017/11/02/donna-brazile-slams-debbie-obama-for-running-the-party-into-the-ground-giving-hillary-control/?utm_campaign=thedcmainpage&utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=Social) from DNC officials and volunteers suggest otherwise.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.2.2. Pro: There is no reason why Democrats can't develop bipartisan policy by themselves, just as Obama passed [nearly every single legislation](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/01/16/obamas_unsung_bipartisan_legacy_132798.html) during his time in office with the help of Republicans.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.2.2.1. Con: The very notion of bipartisanship suggests cooperation and compromise from the opposition party. If the Democrats are passing bills by themselves then they aren't being bipartisan. The fact that Obama was capable of passing legislation with the help of the opposition party meant that the opposition party was either willing to compromise or were strong armed into accepting the deals. The Democrats at the moment [are not seeking deals nor compromise](http://news.gallup.com/poll/207599/democrats-say-leaders-not-compromise-trump.aspx) with this president, [Trump however is willing](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/19/trump-tax-strategy-cut-few-compromises-but-dont-count-democrats/777597001/).
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: This is not true. When Obama was president, the GOP [decided](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/us/politics/17mcconnell.html?pagewanted=all) to oppose all legislation, regardless of whether it was bipartisan or not. Legislation does not require the cooperation of the other side to be bipartisan, it just has to actually reflect ideological principles of both sides.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.2.3. Con: The Democratic party has different groups within it, all with differing opinions on what the best legislative strategy is. There is no reason why the party will eventually follow the path of moderation.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: The more left-wing factions of the Democratic Party have [gained substantial influence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/05/the-remarkably-fast-liberalization-of-the-democratic-party/?utm_term=.cda720eb3c65) in the past decade. It is unlikely that, if left to themselves, they will decide to moderate their legislation.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, recently [demoted](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/even-the-anti-trump-resistance-cant-unite-the-dnc) a large number of progressive party officials who had supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primaries, only to replace them with Hillary Clinton alumni and lobbyists. The internal struggle between the two factions of the party is unlikely to resolve itself any time soon.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.3. Con: Despite nothing but obstruction from the Republicans, Obamacare was actually a [bipartisan](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/opinion/the-original-lie-about-obamacare.html) healthcare act that incorporated many conservative ideas, including borrowing from Mitt Romney's own healthcare plan in Massachusetts. Democrats, of their own volition, made a bipartisan healthcare plan, and there is no reason why they can't be bipartisan in the future either.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.3.1. Con: Obamacare passed without a single [Republican vote](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/21/AR2010032100943.html). The "conservative" ideas were meant to be implemented on a state level and as Romney reiterated several times, the Massachusetts healthcare plan was designed for the people of Massachusetts, it was [never designed to be expanded](http://www.newsweek.com/mitt-romney-mass-health-care-vs-federal-plan-70441) on the national level. If the Democrats were capable of passing a law like Obamacare despite the warnings from their Republican colleagues, then not engaging with this administration will lead to more radical laws.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4. Con: Democrats should unapologetically pursue a more left-wing and partisan legislative agenda as this will increase their electoral chances in 2018 and 2020.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.1. Pro: A [majority of Americans](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/23/public-support-for-single-payer-health-coverage-grows-driven-by-democrats/) now believe that it is the federal government's responsibility to ensure that everybody has healthcare. Pushing a more explicitly left wing healthcare legislative agenda could enable them to tap into this support.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.2. Pro: Bernie Sanders is [currently the most popular active politician in America](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bernie-sanders-most-popular-politician-poll-trump-favorability-a7913306.html). He is considered to be on the far left of the Democratic party, which suggests that a more radical legislative agenda could be very popular with voters.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.3. Con: This relies on the assumption that Democrats will be able to win enough seats in the House and Senate that Republicans can't obstruct their legislative agenda. This is by no means guaranteed.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.3.1. Pro: If the Democrats fail to win Congress with a super-majority, they will need to be able to cooperate with Republicans. A radical left-wing agenda ensures that no such cooperation will be possible.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.4. Pro: The radical wing of the Democratic party is already threatening to break out of the two-party system and form their own '[multiracial, democratic political organisations](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/radical-left-advice-democrats_us_5883f22ce4b070d8cad31155)'. By moving to the left, the Democratic party can retain this key constituency in the upcoming elections.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.4.1. Con: Splinter third parties rarely do well in US politics; the Green Party, for example, got [1% of the vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Stein_presidential_campaign,_2016#Results) in 2016. A breakoff is unlikely to threaten the Democratic party.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.4.2. Con: Moving further to the left is not the best solution for Democrats. Trump was capable of attracting [disenfranchised Democrats](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/upshot/the-obama-trump-voters-are-real-heres-what-they-think.html) to support him because despite the rhetoric, Trump is actually a [moderate](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/donald_trump_is_a_moderate_republican_that_s_why_he_s_winning.html) Republican: nothing he is currently doing or has proposed to do has been surprising since he campaigned on many of the same things. The radical wing of the Democratic party is arguably the [ball](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/08/05/bernie-kamala-and-the-lefts-war-of-mutually-assured-destruction/) and [chain](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/why-this-radical-activist-is-disillusioned-by-the-toxic-culture-of-the-left-a6895211.html) of the Left and should be discarded.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.5. Pro: Protecting the environment is a completely [partisan](https://newrepublic.com/article/128835/politicized-environment) issue, one which Republicans consistently try to undermine.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.6. Con: Campaign finance, ethics and gerrymandering reform; ranked choice voting; transparency; automatic voter registration, and vote-by-mail are just some of the few issues supported by [overwhelming majorities](https://www.salon.com/2017/09/05/democrats-blindspot-our-political-system-is-rigged-and-partisanship-cant-unrig-it/) of Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Bipartisan policy making is definitely better than engaging in partisanship.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.6.1. Con: The status quo of many of these issues \(especially campaign finance, gerrymandering and voter registration\) benefits the institutional Republican Party greatly, regardless of what rank and file members think. It is therefore unlikely that they will be resolved through non-partisan cooperation.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.6.1.1. Pro: Demographics who would be enfranchised through automatic voter registration [tend to vote Democrat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/heres-why-california-republicans-oppose-a-measure-to-link-voter-registration-to-drivers-licenses/?tid=a_inl). For this reason the institutional Republican Party tends to be opposed to it.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.6.1.2. Pro: Gerrymandering benefited [the GOP in the 2016 elections](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/25/partisan-gerrymandering-republicans-2016-report).
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.6.1.3. Pro: The Republican party [receives huge amounts of money from large corporate donors](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/a-guide-to-the-billionaires-bankrolling-the-gop-candidates/391233/) and so would be unlikely to support increased campaign finance regulation.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.7. Pro: Inspiring the base and generating enthusiasm drives high voter turnout, which can be more important than persuading moderates.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.8. Con: A party platform which is more left-wing will push more conservatives to the polls in order to stop policies they are greatly opposed to.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.8.1. Con: Conservatives as a demographic [already reliably turn out in large numbers](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/20/opinion/voter-turnout-democrats-republicans.html). The increase in turn out among liberals that a left-wing platform would drive is likely to be far more significant.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.9. Con: A Democratic Party which is exceedingly far left will have a hard time getting its candidates elected if they continue to alienate parts of the electorate.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.9.1. Con: The Democratic party lost [more](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/opinion/move-left-democrats.html) voters to third party candidates than they did to Trump in 2016. To move leftwards to regain those disaffected voters is exactly what the party needs to do.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.9.1.1. Pro: In the decisive states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, the Republican total increased by about 440,000 votes, whereas the third and fourth-party surge was of 503,000 votes. More Democrats shifted to the Libertarian or the Green candidate than they did to Republicans, and [moving](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/opinion/move-left-democrats.html) to the Centre will not get them back.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.9.1.2. Con: This assumes that the voters who disaffected to third party candidates did so because Democrats weren't left enough. In fact, it could have been for a variety of other reasons, including the [sheer unpopularity](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-poll-popularity-record-low-us-presidential-election-2016-a7390346.html) of the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.9.2. Pro: [Central](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/opinion/center-democrats-identity-politics.html) to the Democrats’ diminishment has been their loss of support among [working-class voters](http://prospect.org/article/democrats’-‘working-class-problem’), who feel abandoned by the party’s shift away from moderate positions on trade and immigration, from backing police and tough anti-crime measures, and from trying to restore manufacturing jobs. Moving to the left will not bring them back to the fold.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.9.3. Pro: In the election to become Virginia's Governor, the centre-left candidate not only [beat](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/06/13/establishment-candidate-beats-sanders-backed-liberal-va-gubernatorial-primary/102832012/) the more liberal insurgent in the primary, but decisively [won](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/08/democrats-win-up-and-down-the-ballot-in-legislative-mayoral-and-governors-races.html) the Governorship as well. Voters clearly preferred the moderate Democratic candidate over the more liberal one.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.9.4. Pro: Most Democratic voters [identify](http://www.thirdway.org/report/why-demography-does-not-equal-destiny) as “moderate” or “conservative". Ignoring them to focus on the more left-wing base is political suicide.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.9.5. Pro: Most of Bernie Sander's voters [aren't](https://newrepublic.com/article/143286/bernie-sanderss-army-not-democratic-base) part of the traditional Democratic base. Reaching out to the far left risks losing the more traditional Democratic voters, an electoral strategy that may not even result in any gains.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.9.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.2. Con: There is little hope for bipartisan legislation in the future.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: There is [very little](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/05/politics/poll-partisans-growing-apart/index.html) the Democrats and Republicans agree on.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.2.2. Pro: Given their [previous strategies](https://www.politico.com/story/2010/10/the-gops-no-compromise-pledge-044311) when not in power, it is unlikely that Republicans will try and work with Democrats.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.2.2.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.4.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.2. Con: Attempting to cooperate and negotiate with Trump takes up the time, effort, and expertise of Democratic legislators. It therefore means that they have less resources to devote to policy development.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.2.1. Con: The point of cooperating and negotiating with Trump is to create a policy that is workable for both sides of the political spectrum. Policy development is a part of the negotiating process.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.3. Con: It is much easier to energise their base to turn out and campaign on the basis of a separate policy platform if they aren't seen to be simultaneously capitulating to Trump.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.4. Con: If Democrats try to push an independent policy platform and capitulate to the Trump administration at the same time, they will look like unprincipled flip-floppers.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.4.1. Con: There is nothing principally inconsistent about developing an independent policy platform and also cooperating with Trump; both are simply mechanisms by which to achieve better public policy.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6. Pro: Trump will want to avoid primary challenges in 2020 from candidates to the right of him. If Trump looks moderate, he is more likely to be vulnerable to a serious challenge.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.1. Con: Trump's unpopularity levels are high enough that he is likely to face primary challenges either way.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.1.1. Con: Around [80 percent](http://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx) of Republicans approve of the job President Trump is doing.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.6.2.1.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2. Con: Trump is unlikely to fear primary challenges. The last time an incumbent president lost a primary was [in 1852](http://www.npr.org/sections/politicaljunkie/2009/07/a_president_denied_renominatio.html).
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.7.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.2. Pro: There are very few Republicans to the right of Trump with enough name recognition, charisma, and connections to launch a robust campaign for president.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.2.1. Con: The right-wing insurgency within the Republican party is [gaining momentum](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/10/26/16552816/republican-elites-insurgency-mcconnell-bannon-media-flake), and has already ended the careers of establishment Republicans such as Jeff Flake. It is not impossible for a right-wing candidate to emerge in the next four years that could threaten Trump.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.2.2. Con: Trump himself lacked political connections and experience, but nevertheless managed to succeed off of the back of right-wing antiestablishment sentiment. Other candidates could attempt to replicate that.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.3. Con: The primary system is structurally built to empower challengers.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.3.1. Pro: The race starts in two smaller states, [New Hampshire and Iowa](http://mashable.com/2015/04/21/iowa-new-hampshire-first-caucus-primary/#POm.B1MNQSqw), with diverse and anti-establishment political traditions. This allows challengers to build momentum early in the season.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.3.1.1. Pro: New Hampshire has a famously [independent](http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/268461-independent-voters-play-key-role-in-nh-primaries) political streak.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.3.2. Pro: The long lead-up to primary elections can give challengers a leg-up where, in other systems, incumbents would always have the advantage.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.3.2.1. Pro: The long lead-up to election season means that challengers can spend months campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire to level the playing field with already established candidates. Then they can gain momentum from success in these states.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: Ted Cruz started [campaigning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz_presidential_campaign,_2016) in Iowa in 2013 for a caucus that was on February 1st, 2016. He came in first place.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.3.2.1.2. Con: It takes money, time and staff to campaign for months on end without running your campaign into the ground. This benefits incumbents and elites, not challengers.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.3.2.1.2.1. Con: Challengers are usually also established members of the party who can access the necessary funding and resources, or can self-fund, as Trump himself did.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.3.2.2. Pro: The race happens over a long period of time, allowing for candidates to build name recognition and support.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: Bernie Sanders went from a fringe political figure in Congress, to nearly becoming the Democratic nominee, by building on successes over a long period of time.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.3.2.2.2. Con: This isn't structurally advantageous compared to the incumbent, who has the name recognition and support from having been in the White House for five years.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.3.2.3. Pro: The long lead-up can give more time for challengers to fundraise and court big donors so that they can pose a meaningful challenge.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.3.2.4. Con: Challengers are not always able to use the run-up to their advantage since many of the votes are cast [more than a month](http://iowademocrats.org/early-voting/) before the actual day of the primary while challengers are still building steam.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.3.2.4.1. Pro: Bernie Sanders [performed far better](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/seth-abramson/sanders-currently-winning-democratic-primary-race-ill-prove-to-you_b_9528076.html) on the primary days than he did in early voting, because much of early voting took place before he really had a chance to campaign.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.4. Con: Primary challenges can often destabilize or weaken incumbents and hurt them in the general election.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.4.1. Pro: Jimmy Carter's presidential primary was contentious and bitter, narrowly beating Ted Kennedy. He went on to [lose in a landslide](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-presidents-get-primary-challenges/) to Ronald Reagan.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.4.2. Pro: An extremely contentious Democratic Party convention in 1968 led to the [nomination](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-presidents-get-primary-challenges/) of LBJ's vice president, Hubert Humphrey, over the pro-peace Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy. The frustration of much of the party helped to lead to Richard Nixon's victory.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.4.3. Pro: Hillary Clinton's heated 2016 primary against Bernie Sanders [arguably](http://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-trump-2016-election-654320) contributed to her loss in the general election.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.4.3.1. Con: The primary against Sanders was normal in most respects, and [the data does not indicate](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/did-bernie-sanders-cost-hillary-clinton-the-presidency/) that it contributed to her loss.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.3. Con: The majority of his base will not want far right candidates because the majority of [his base are center right individuals](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/428353/trump-doesnt-represent-conservative-base-jonah-goldberg) and [some center left individuals.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/opinion/did-moderates-help-elect-trump.html) In other words, he appeals to moderates. The more moderate Trump is, the better.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.4. Pro: Trump's [biggest threat](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/18/could-donald-trump-lose-in-the-gop-primaries/) in the primaries in 2020 would be someone from the right who would make all the campaign promises Trump did but convince the voters that he could do it better than Trump.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.4.1. Pro: Low popularity in polling suggests that if a candidate felt emboldened to run, they would be able to convince voters.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.4.2. Con: This is not necessarily the case. If Trump moderated his platform to get Democrats and moderate Republicans on side, he would accomplish far more and have far more to show at the end of four years. This would be a robust defence in a primary challenge.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.4.2.1. Con: Trump is [antagonising](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-government-shutdown-budget-tax-plan-no-deal-us-president-congress-a8080241.html) Democrats, so it is unlikely he will adopt this path.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.4.2.2. Con: Given how polarising and adversarial Trump is, and the litany of accusations of sexism and racism against him, it is extremely unlikely he will moderate, much less get Democrats to vote for him.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.5. Con: Trump's appeal has little to do with policy positions. It has more to do with his [authoritarian personality](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/donald-trump-2016-authoritarian-213533). Trump's base will support him no matter what he does, as long as Trump does it.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.6. Pro: Trump benefited from division among the more mainstream and establishment candidates during the 2016 Republican primary. If his base was to be divided among multiple candidates, however, then he might be unseated.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.6.1. Con: There were plenty of conservatives like Scott Walker and Ted Cruz, who ended up losing by a large margin to Trump in 2016.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.6.1.1. Con: Trump won the Republican primary based on a mix of [anti-establishment sentiment and cultural grievances](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republican-voters-decided-on-trump/), something unique to his candidacy. Scott Walker and Ted Cruz weren't able to split Trump's base because they didn't fight the election on his terms, but that doesn't mean Republicans in the future can't.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.6.1.1.1. Con: The main part of Donald Trump's campaign was the anti-establishment part, and [replicating this](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-cruz-candidacy-20160503-snap-story.html) did not help Ted Cruz. It is unlikely to help future Republicans.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Replicating Trump's anti-establishment rhetoric did not work for Ted Cruz as he had been in the "establishment" for a while. Trump was seen as an outsider. This approach can help Republicans who are new or are political outsiders.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.6.2. Pro: In fact, the Republican Party was arguably just as divided as the Democratic Party in the run-up to the 2016 election, if not more so. Yet Trump still comfortably took the nomination and the presidency.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.7. Pro: A primary could weaken Trump's candidacy in the general election.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.4.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.7.2. Pro: A primary would be an immense waste of money and time for Trump.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.7.2.1. Pro: Clinton and Sanders [spent](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/us/politics/hillary-clinton-money.html) tens of millions of dollars each month during the height of the campaign.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.7.3. Pro: A primary challenger could attack Trump and lower his popularity prior to the general election.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.2.4.3.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.8. Pro: When Trump passes left-leaning legislation, this makes him look weak and unprincipled.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.8.1. Con: If Democrats cooperate with Trump, it will not lead to left-leaning legislation - just slightly less far right-leaning legislation. This will make the Democrats look weak, not Trump.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.8.1.1. Pro: The Republican Party holds the House, the Senate and a majority of state governors and legislatures. Republicans and Trump have far more bargaining power than Democrats do.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.8.1.1.1. Con: The Republicans are [desperate](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/27/16374582/paul-ryan-tax-reform) to pass tax reform, as the electoral consequences of not being able to do so will be devastating. This gives Democrats considerable bargaining power.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.8.1.1.1.1. Con: On the contrary, Republicans [passed](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-vote-congress.html?emc=edit_mbae_20171220&nl=&nlid=76391954&te=1&_r=0) unpopular tax reform legislation without the vote of a single Democrat, either in the House or the Senate.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.8.1.2. Con: This would still make the Democrats look stronger than if they failed to pass any legislation at all.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.8.1.2.1. Con: Democrats not cooperating with Trump does not mean they sit back and do nothing; they can actively obstruct his agenda. This makes him look weak, and makes them look like a necessary opposition.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.8.1.2.1.1. Pro: This is far more preferable to the image Democrats would take on if they worked with Trump - that they are just as bad as him, and that their voters might as well not turn out.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.8.1.3. Con: It is unlikely that Democrats would sign off on 'slightly less far right-leaning legislation'; either the legislation will seek to accomplish something Democrats stand for, or it will simply not be supported.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.8.2. Con: Those supporters which have stuck with Trump this far, despite the numerous scandals and mistakes, will not leave him for marginal cooperation with the Democrats. Moderates, on the other hand, may see Trump more favorably now.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.8.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.3.3.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.8.4. Pro: Cooperation can equally ignite [backlash](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/09/house-crazies-angry-at-trumps-debt-deal-threaten-paul-ryan.html) from Republicans, as it did when Trump made a deal with Democrats to raise the debt ceiling for three months.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7. Pro: The Trump administration acts erratically and cannot be trusted.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.1. Pro: [Politifact's](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/) tracking of how well Trump has been able to keep his promises shows that he is untrustworthy.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.2. Pro: Trump broke [64 promises](https://thinkprogress.org/trump-broke-64-promises-in-his-first-month-in-office-5470f2c337e1/) in just his first month in office.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.3. Pro: Trump [unexpectedly](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/trump-debt-limit-deal-democrats) broke with his own party and made a deal with the Democrats on policy regarding the debt ceiling. There's no reason to expect that he would be more loyal towards the Democrats.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.3.1. Con: He may not be an ally all the time, but once co-operation happens, it is likely to lead to more avenues of co-operation in the future.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.3.1.1. Con: Yet such cooperation did not continue, and in fact [stopped](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/28/democrats-pelosi-schumer-trump-meeting) when work on tax legislation began.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.3.1.2. Con: Cooperation with Democrats will simply be used by Trump as a way of [signalling](http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Democrats-consider-Trump-s-potential-for-12184359.php) to Republicans that they either fall in line behind him or he will go another route. If anything, cooperation will strengthen the Republican party.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.3.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.8.4.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.4. Pro: Trump has also shown that he has no problem with breaking previous commitments made by the U.S. government, as seen with the withdrawal from the [Paris agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Paris_Agreement). This suggests that Trump can't be relied upon to uphold any commitments made by the U.S.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.4.1. Con: Trump opposed the Paris Agreement during his [campaign](http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-36401174). If anything, his actions prove that he can be trusted.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.5. Con: Democrats achieve success if they manage to make a deal with Trump that he upholds, or they make Trump look bad if he breaks the deal - making a deal with Trump is a win-win situation either way for the Democrats.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.6. Con: Trump's unpredictability means that he does not consistently stick with Republican legislators. This allows Democrats to occasionally work with him.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.6.1. Con: If the Democrats agree to cooperate with Trump on an issue and Trump suddenly decides to pull out, the Democrats would look foolish for trusting Trump.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.6.1.1. Con: Democrats can always choose to cease co-operation in the future after such an instance. However, they should not cease co-operation just because they think Trump may pull out.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.6.1.2. Con: It is more likely that Trump would look untrustworthy and the Democrats would look good for trying to cooperate.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.6.1.2.1. Con: Trump posits himself as a successful businessman who can discern a good deal from a bad one. His base is likely to see this as him not signing a bad deal.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.3.1.2.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.7. Pro: The Trump administration is deceptive. Trump and his team have used varying tactics to [manipulate and mislead](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/18/donald-trump-media-manipulation-tactics) the public.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8. Con: It is possible for Democrats to obtain concessions from Trump on certain matters that are important to them.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.2. Pro: The Trump administration became the first Republican administration to include paid parental leave in their budget \([pg.20](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/budget/fy2018/budget.pdf)\). The move marks a key departure from Republicans' traditional opposition to paid family leave; a benefit long advocated by Democrats.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.3. Pro: Trump recently went against his own party’s congressional leadership and struck a [deal](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/trumps-christmas-gift-to-democrats/539022/) with Democrats to package nearly $8 billion in Hurricane Harvey relief with a three-month extension of government funding and increase in the debt ceiling.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.4. Pro: Trump [promised](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/donald-trumps-big-spending-infrastructure-dream/494993/) a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, a policy on which Obama could never get the Republicans to commit to.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.4.1. Pro: Democrats have a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that is very [different](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/24/14369666/democrats-infrastructure-plan-trump) from the one Trump has promised; it is only by cooperating with the President will they be able to get a bill that incorporates provisions important to them.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.4.1.1. Con: If the Democrats' infrastructure plan differs significantly from Trump's, it is unlikely that they will convince him to adopt some of its provisions.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.4.1.1.1. Con: President Trump wants to be able to claim that he is a bipartisan president and get credit from the Democrats for his legislation.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.4.1.1.2. Pro: Trump would not want to deviate significantly from his proposed plan, for fear of being seen as changing his mind or being too conciliatory to the Democrats.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.4.1.1.3. Pro: Trump's infrastructure plan, when it is presented to Congress, will likely be backed by Republicans. Since Democrats do not have a majority in the Senate or the House, Trump has no incentive to deviate from the Republican plan to the Democratic one.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.5. Pro: Trump has passed [laws](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-policies-liberals-like-2017-2/#guaranteed-paid-leave-3) to encourage women to enter STEM fields.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.7.1.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.7. Con: Trump has the ability to manipulate the situation in order to make concessions one-sided. For instance, the only reason the deal to protect Dreamers was necessary, was because Trump arbitrarily decided to crack down and cause a political crisis.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.7.1. Con: Concessions, however, were not one sided. Trump was [willing to grant citizenship](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/10/trump-administration-comes-out-for-amnesty-for-dreamers.html) to the current Dreamers, an act which went against the majority of his base and was an issue that the Democrats had wanted. In exchange, Trump wanted [increased border security and the end of DACA to reduce the incentive for illegal immigration](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/09/14/trump-says-no-deal-reached-dems-over-dreamers-border-wall/665109001/). This is in essence a workable compromise and involves concessions from both sides.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.7.2. Con: His action was not arbitrary. His administration faced an [impending lawsuit](https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/money/4927838/trump-daca-attorney-generals) that likely would have striken down DACA.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.7.2.1. Con: There is no reason to believe this lawsuit would have been successful. Ultimately, this was Trump's decision.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.7.3. Pro: Whenever Trump wants leverage, he need only threaten to do something disastrous to push the Democrats into a bad bargaining position.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.8. Pro: Trump went around the Republicans to make a deal with the Democrats to [avert](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-congress-harvey-aid-20170906-story.html) a budget and debt crisis. Cooperation is clearly possible.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.9. Pro: Republicans have threatened to cut social welfare programs such as Medicare. Democrats should be willing to work with Trump to stop this.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.9.1. Con: Even if Democrats and Trump happen to agree on Medicare, [Trumpcare](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/06/trumpcare-vs-obamacare) is diametrically opposed to Democratic healthcare demands and policies. To get Trump's support, concessions would have to be made. These concessions could lead to a loss of voters, but even if they do not, would lead to compromising on fundamental Democratic principles.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.9.2. Con: Democrats do not need Trump's support to block harmful GOP legislation. They can rely on some Republican senators or congressmen to do so, as was evidenced by the [failure of Trumpcare.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/opinion/trumpcare-dead-opposition-healthcare.html)
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.9.2.1. Con: Yet this did not happen when it came to [tax reform](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/01/politics/senate-tax-bill-vote-uncertainty/index.html). Democrats cannot just rely on some Republican senators or congressmen to defeat legislation; they need to cooperate with Trump.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.9.3. Pro: On the campaign trail, Trump promised that he would not cut Medicare and Social Security programs '[like every other Republican](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/313223-priebus-trump-doesnt-want-to-meddle-with-medicare-or-social-security)'.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.9.3.1. Con: Yet Trump has [embraced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/05/22/another-core-trump-campaign-promise-falls-by-the-wayside/?utm_term=.011f02575986) cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.9. Con: Democrats should at least attempt to cooperate with him. Even if cooperation is unsuccessful, Democrats cannot be held morally responsible, since they have done their best to make government function. Otherwise, they are to blame for the ineffectiveness of government.
1.1.2.1.2.9.1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.4.1.1.
1.1.2.1.2.10. Pro: The [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window), the range of acceptable discourse, shifts towards racism, misogyny, the alt-right, and other things Trump has exhibited or defended when he is normalized.
1.1.2.1.2.10.1. Pro: Even if the Democrats are able to score short term legislative victories, cooperation will normalise alt-right discourse and portray it as acceptable to tap into. Future politicians could easily follow in Trump's footsteps, something that would have an extremely adverse effect on American society and democracy.
1.1.2.1.2.10.1.1. Pro: Individuals would be emboldened to be openly racist. This would have a serious effect on the lives of members of marginalised communities.
1.1.2.1.2.10.1.2. Pro: If alt-right discourse is normalised, a future candidate that did not mimic Trumps's more brash and belligerent behaviour might be able to appeal to the same alt-right and white nationalist tropes that Trump appealed to. Such a candidate would potentially be even more dangerous than Trump as, no matter how dangerous their ideas might be, they would appear reasonable.
1.1.2.1.2.10.1.3. Con: Alt-right discourse was normalised when Trump won the Republican nomination, and was further normalised when he won the Presidency. This cannot be undone by the non-cooperation of a party with no control.
1.1.2.1.2.10.1.3.1. Con: But it can be made worse by cooperation from the opposition, a party which should otherwise stand in steadfast opposition to the ideals Trump espouses.
1.1.2.1.2.10.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.7.
1.1.2.1.2.10.2. Pro: Granting Trump legislative victories normalises Alt-Right voters and their discourse: someone they explicitly supported and voted for, while in power, not only got the cooperation of Democrats, but also passed bipartisan legislation. As a constituency, the Alt-Right won't be as toxic as they used to be.
1.1.2.1.2.10.3. Pro: A refusal to cooperate is a radical measure which indicates that the status quo is completely out of the ordinary, and should not be treated as a normal political situation.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: Whether the obstructions are warranted or not makes little practical difference; they still harm the Democratic Party's chances.
1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: The appearance of hypocrisy makes the Democrats look as if they care more about tit-for-tat point-scoring than their constituents. And worse, it makes them look weak when their obstructionism [doesn't even work](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/apr/07/senate-confirms-neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-trump).
1.1.2.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.
1.1.2.2. Con: If a lack of cooperation with Trump produced favourable political outcomes for Democrats, then whether or not they acted hypocritically would be of comparatively little importance.
1.1.2.3. Con: Compromise works both ways. If the Democrats cooperate, when the Republicans were so obstructionist during the Obama presidency, and Republicans show no signs that they have changed, then Democrats weaken their position.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: The Democrats were also obstructionists during the Obama years as well. The difference then was they refused to [include republicans or public disclosure \(C-SPAN\)](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/doug-heye/2010/01/05/c-span-demands-democrats-open-secret-health-reform-talks) in the process. Today the Democrats refuse to contribute.
1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.
1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.
1.1.5. Con: President Trump [regularly](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html?_r=1) makes claims without any basis in fact. Whether or not he is actually bipartisan is less important than whether his followers believe that he is bipartisan.
1.1.5.1. Con: If Trump is simply unable to pass legislation, there is nothing his electoral base can point to to prove that he is bipartisan.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: Trump is very good at spinning situations in his favor. He will make Democrats seem like unnecessarily hardcore obstructionists, something that his base is likely to buy as opposed to viewing him as the loser.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Trump has consistently [blamed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/24/republican-healthcare-plan-bill-vote-pulled-obamacare-trump) the Democrats for preventing the repeal of Obamacare.
1.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Alternatively, Trump simply [passes on the blame](https://www.vox.com/2017/3/26/15064014/white-house-judge-jeanine-paul-ryan-ahca) for failure onto members of his party, as he did when Obamacare was not repealed.
1.1.5.1.1.3. Pro: Despite having [utter disregard](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html) for the truth, GOP voters [believe](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/02/22/gop-voters-know-trump-is-telling-them-the-truth-and-the-media-is-lying-to-them/?utm_term=.76009fb2c2b8) that he tells them the truth. His ability to lie his way through tough political situations is unlikely to change.
1.1.5.1.1.4. Con: If Trump is good at spinning situations into his favour without much regard for the truth, then he will spin either situation into his favour, whether the Democrats do or do not decide to cooperate.
1.1.5.1.1.5. Con: Yet Trump's approval rating is [falling](http://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx) among Republicans and Independents, illustrating the limitations of the political spin emanating from the White House.
1.1.5.2. Con: Even if this is true, allowing Trump to actually be bipartisan just strengthens that image.
1.1.6. Con: On the contrary, being bipartisan is what hurts Trump more.
1.1.6.1. Pro: GOP leaders have mostly [rejected](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/01/dreamers-house-gop-border-wall-trump-immigration-243311) Trump's overtures to the Democrats, especially his deal regarding the Dreamers.
1.1.6.2. Con: 72% of Republicans are [happy](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/trump_administration/september_2017/most_voters_welcome_trump_s_outreach_to_congressional_democrats) about Trump reaching out to Democrats, and 66% of all voters approve of this move. Appearing as a bipartisan President definitely helps Trump's approval ratings.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.3.2.1.1.
1.1.6.3. Con: By a 2-to-1 margin, Republican voters said that they trust Trump \(56 percent\) [more than they trust](https://morningconsult.com/2017/09/13/republicans-trust-trump-gop-leaders-bipartisan-dealmaking/) Republican leaders \(28 percent\) to work with Democrats in Congress to achieve certain policy outcomes.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: This does not necessarily indicate that voters want Trump to engage in bipartisan dealmaking, only that if bipartisan deals are made, they would prefer that Trump make them.
1.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: This may even indicate that Republican voters are hesitant towards bipartisan cooperation, and feel that Trump would be better because he would take harder stances with the Democrats.
1.1.6.4. Pro: A bipartisan approach on tax reform is [anathema](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/15/16305114/trump-paul-ryan-separate-worlds-tax-reform) to Republicans who want to cut taxes on the wealthy, whereas Democrats want to raise them. Cooperation would only have created backlash, which is why tax reform was eventually passed without a [single](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-vote-congress.html?_r=0) [Democrat's vote](http://time.com/5072678/gop-tax-reform-bipartisan/).
1.1.6.4.1. Pro: Republican tax plans have included provisions which substantially harm [Democrat-held states](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-states/republican-tax-plan-a-blow-to-democratic-states-officials-say-idUSKBN1D300Q).
1.1.6.4.2. Pro: The tax legislation passed will [raise](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-republican-tax-plan-contains-more-middle-class-pain-than-even-its-critics-are-saying) [taxes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwasik/2017/11/29/how-the-gop-tax-plan-scrooges-middle-class-retired-and-poor/#8d27b116c1ee) for the middle class.
1.1.6.4.2.1. Pro: According to the [Tax Policy Centre](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/about), an independent group that analyses tax policy, the bill will [increase taxes](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/publication/147726/2001579_preliminary_distributional_analysis_of_the_tax_cuts_and_jobs_act_0.pdf), on net, for families that have at least one child and make less than $100,000.
1.1.6.4.3. Pro: The tax reform passed will [raise the deficit](http://uk.businessinsider.com/trump-gop-tax-reform-bill-impact-economy-business-debt-income-2017-12) by $1.5 trillion. The Republicans will likely pay for this through tax increases or [benefit cuts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwasik/2017/11/29/how-the-gop-tax-plan-scrooges-middle-class-retired-and-poor/) for the middle class and poor.
1.1.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.
1.1.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.6.8.
1.1.7. Pro: Marginal voters pay little or no attention to politics, so they [won’t](https://hbr.org/2017/02/if-democrats-want-to-challenge-trump-they-need-a-new-strategy) give Democrats credit for being bipartisan. They will simply give credit to the President for getting anything done. An attempt to cooperate will backfire on the Democrats by raising Trump's popularity.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Only 36% of Americans can [correctly identify](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/09/22/just-36-percent-of-americans-can-name-which-parties-control-house-senate/?utm_term=.7a90125f7727) which party controls the House and Senate. Among registered voters, that number only increases to 41%. Such a populace is hardly going to identify Democrats as the reason legislation was passed, much less give them credit for it.
1.1.7.2. Pro: On the flip side, if Democrats successfully block an infrastructure bill, marginal Trump voters are not likely to blame Democrats for that opposition — they will just blame the president for failing to get things done.
1.1.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.4.1.1.
1.1.7.2.2. Pro: Voters tend to attribute all outcomes, positive or negative, to the president, [regardless](https://hbr.org/2017/02/if-democrats-want-to-challenge-trump-they-need-a-new-strategy) of what actually happened. Uniform opposition to Trump makes him look weak, not the Democrats.
1.1.7.2.2.1. Con: Failing to make deals with a party that has adopted a policy of blanket obstruction and noncooperation does not indicate that someone is not generally a dealmaker. Republican voters are unlikely to hold this against Trump.
1.1.7.2.2.1.1. Pro: Trump has [already attempted](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/18/trump-blames-democrats-and-a-few-republicans-for-health-care-bill-collapse.html) to shift blame for the failure of legislation he supports onto legislators who vote against him.
1.1.7.2.2.1.2. Con: Obama [has been blamed](https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/01/19/how-press-never-stopped-blaming-obama-radical-gop-obstruction/215056) for failing to accomplish much in his presidency, despite the fact that Republican obstruction was a heavy contributor.
1.1.7.2.2.1.3. Pro: Trump can blame the incompetence of "establishment" figures like Mitch McConnell rather than take the blame himself. His base is already primed to believe these sorts of claims.
1.1.7.2.2.1.4. Pro: After the gridlock and partisanship of Obama's term in the White House, voters are already accustomed to nothing happening and compromise being elusive. The bar is set very low for Trump.
1.1.7.2.2.1.4.1. Con: Since Trump promised to replace the "old, broken" system with a new system that will get things done, voters are unlikely to be satisfied with performance similar to Obama's.
1.1.7.2.2.1.5. Con: Voters may choose to blame both President Trump and the Democrats for failure to compromise. This is still harmful to President Trump.
1.1.7.2.2.1.5.1. Con: Voters may blame both, but in the instance that they blame the Democratic Party more than they blame Trump, such actions benefit Republicans.
1.1.7.2.2.1.6. Pro: A big part of his mantra was his ability to recognise and reject a bad deal when he sees one: [NAFTA](https://thetylt.com/politics/nafta-bad-trade-deal) and the [Paris Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Paris_Agreement) are prime examples. Deals proposed by Democrats can be rejected as "bad deals" without damaging his reputation.
1.1.7.3. Con: Coverage of legislation often involves headlines like "Republican Tax Bill Passes House With Democratic Support." If voters are paying enough attention to know what Trump is or isn't doing, then they are also likely to be aware of whether he is doing it in cooperation with Democrats.
1.1.7.3.1. Con: Voters are unlikely to [read beyond](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/03/19/americans-read-headlines-and-not-much-else/?utm_term=.b869533ea1e9) such headlines. Given this scenario, framing the piece of legislation as a Republican one automatically gives the party more legitimacy.
1.1.7.3.2. Con: The reason a voter is a marginal voter is because they don't pay that much attention to politics, or follow daily coverage of Congress and the White House. As far as marginal voters are concerned, any good thing that happens during a particular President's term happens because of that President.
1.1.8. Pro: Trump got elected on the mantra that he was a [deal-maker](https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2017-07-21/trump-promised-to-be-a-deal-maker-hes-not); destroying that image is crucial to defeating him in future elections.
1.1.8.1. Pro: Trump is afraid of appearing as the '[loser](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/27/politics/donald-trump-alabama-race-roy-moore/index.html)' in any political situation. Not being able to make deals with Democrats would force that label onto him, which will only frustrate him and his base more.
1.1.8.1.1. Pro: Trump is already facing the [perception](https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2017-08-04/trump-faces-perception-that-he-is-a-loser) that he is a loser. The Democrats should capitalise on that rather than give Trump a way out.
1.1.8.1.2. Pro: The reputation of being a loser is compounded when refusal to cooperate prevents Trump from achieving his legislative agenda.
1.1.8.1.2.1. Pro: Without Democratic support, it is nearly impossible for Trump to achieve his legislative agenda.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1. Pro: The Republican party is a party that wants to cut back on governmental programs, an intellectual disposition that makes passing legislation [incredibly difficult](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/opinion/republicans-bills-fail.html).
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: A [growing majority](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/23/public-support-for-single-payer-health-coverage-grows-driven-by-democrats/) of Americans, currently 60%, say the federal government is responsible for ensuring health care coverage for all Americans. The public mood is not in favour of rolling back government programs.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Even among those who say the federal government is not responsible for ensuring Americans have health care coverage, there is little public appetite for government withdrawing entirely from involvement in health care coverage. Only  5% of Americans say the government [should not be involved at all](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/23/public-support-for-single-payer-health-coverage-grows-driven-by-democrats/) in providing health insurance.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: However, two-thirds of Republicans and Republican leaners \([68%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/23/public-support-for-single-payer-health-coverage-grows-driven-by-democrats/)\) think the American government is not responsible for providing health care. Clearly there is enough support for a smaller government.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Yet most Republicans \([57%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/23/public-support-for-single-payer-health-coverage-grows-driven-by-democrats/)\) say the government “should continue programs like Medicare and Medicaid for seniors and the very poor,” something the GOP is [aiming to cut](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/4/16416646/bernie-sanders-gop-budget-medicare) from its budget.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: In a survey conducted in April 2017, majorities in both political parties said they favored [maintaining or increasing spending](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/26/few-americans-support-cuts-to-most-government-programs-including-medicaid/) in nearly all of the 14 specific budget areas that respondents were asked about. There is little public appetite for government cuts.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.3. Con: According to a survey conducted in April 2017, Americans are [split](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/26/few-americans-support-cuts-to-most-government-programs-including-medicaid/) in their preferences on the size and scope of government: 48% said they would rather have a bigger government providing more services, while 45% preferred a smaller government providing fewer services.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: While true when asked about the general budget, Americans tend [not to favor budget cuts](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/26/few-americans-support-cuts-to-most-government-programs-including-medicaid/) when asked about specific areas being affected. Republicans may get elected on a  campaign of smaller government, but they can't cut back specific programs without hurting their constituencies.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.3.2. Con: More Americans still want a bigger government than want a smaller government, and the tide is [moving](http://www.people-press.org/2017/04/24/with-budget-debate-looming-growing-share-of-public-prefers-bigger-government/) towards a bigger government: support for bigger government increased by 7 percentage points since last September alone.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.3.3. Con: Although Americans are quick to say they don't like big government, voters of all political stripes, including many Republicans, are [less receptive](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-libertarians/americans-dont-like-big-government-but-like-many-programs-poll-idUSKBN0NL15B20150430) when asked about ending specific functions of the federal government.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.4. Pro: When asked slightly differently, 57% of Americans, [a record high](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/poll-record-number-americans-say-government-should-do-more-n749766), think the government 'should do more' to solve problems and meet the needs of Americans.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.1. Con: 69% of Republicans still think the government [does far too much](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/poll-record-number-americans-say-government-should-do-more-n749766), and that is the base the Republican party needs to care about.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.1.1. Con: But this is a [shrinking](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/poll-record-number-americans-say-government-should-do-more-n749766) base: 10% fewer Republicans think the government does too much as compared to seven years ago, in 2010.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.2. Pro: In 2010, independents favored a less active government by 22 percentage points. This year, they favor a more active government [by the same share](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/poll-record-number-americans-say-government-should-do-more-n749766).
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.5. Pro: Federal anti-poverty programs primarily help the GOP's base: whites without a college degree - the cornerstone of the modern GOP electoral coalition - are the [principal beneficiaries](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/gop-base-poverty-snap-social-security/516861/) of such programs. This highlights the contradiction within the Republican party.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.1. Pro: 152 House Republicans, out of 241 total, [represent](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/gop-base-poverty-snap-social-security/516861/) heavily blue-collar districts where the white population exceeds the national average and the portion of those whites with at least a four-year degree lags below the national average. These House Republicans cannot vote for cutting back federal programs without risking their own political careers.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.6. Pro: More than 20% of the U.S. population [receives](https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/whos-on-welfare-9-shocking-stats-about-public-assistance.html/?a=viewall) public assistance, and this percentage is increasing. It will be difficult for the Republican party to roll back government programs when so many Americans depend on them.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.7. Pro: Trump [ran](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/trump-government-ethnocentrism/473538/) on a campaign of big government, where he vowed to use government as a tool to improve the lot of his supporters. Even though a Republican is in the White House, his election was the defeat of mainstream Republican ideology.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.7.1. Pro: Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, Trump's main opponents in the Republican primaries, all [ran](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/trump-government-ethnocentrism/473538/) on shrinking the role of government and lost.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.7.2. Pro: On trade, Trump [broke](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/11/us/politics/-trade-donald-trump-breaks-200-years-economic-orthodoxy-mercantilism.html?_r=0) with Republican orthodoxy by promising to interfere in the free market: he promised to implement an import tax and penalise American companies that build foreign factories.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.7.3. Pro: Trump promised a [$100 trillion](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/donald-trumps-big-spending-infrastructure-dream/494993/) infrastructure plan, which is highly unlikely to gain support from Republicans and therefore unlikely to pass without Democratic support.
1.1.8.1.2.1.1.8. Pro: [Healthcare reform](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare/republicans-fail-again-to-kill-off-obamacare-in-senate-idUSKCN1C00BT) has failed repeatedly because it would involve loss of insurance for many people who receive insurance through the current law.
1.1.8.1.2.1.2. Con: Republicans [have a majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/115th_United_States_Congress) in both the House and Senate. They can pass legislation independently of the Democrats.
1.1.8.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Republicans are far [too divided](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/after-health-care-loss-what-s-next-divided-republican-congress-n739266) to be able to push through legislation by themselves.
1.1.8.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: The Freedom Caucus, which has enough support in the House to [block](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/09/freedom-caucus-meadows-labrador-sanford-ryan/97704576/) any legislation, makes it difficult for Trump to get a Republican consensus on legislation.
1.1.8.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The Freedom Caucus [doomed](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-freedom-caucus-obamacare-repeal-replace-secret-pact-236507) any Obamacare repeal effort they deemed to not be sufficiently right-wing, yet healthcare reform was [impossible](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gops-new-health-care-plan-is-doomed-without-moderate-republicans/) without the support of the moderate Republicans as well.
1.1.8.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Republican party is so divided on healthcare reform that Trump has [warned](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/344669-hatch-gop-too-divided-to-restart-obamacare-repeal) that he will work with Democrats instead; if Democrats refuse to cooperate, Trump will never be able to achieve healthcare reform.
1.1.8.1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: More and more Republicans are [coming out against](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/republican-party-flake-mccain-corker-bush-trump.html?emc=edit_mbae_20171025&nl=&nlid=76391954&te=1) Trump, with Senators rebuking the President for his hard-right brand of politics. The Republicans are far from a united front.
1.1.8.1.2.1.3. Pro: Mitch McConnell, the current majority leader in the Senate, does not actually want to pass partisan legislation. He wants Democratic buy-in for anything with the potential to be unpopular, so his party members [cannot be blamed](https://www.thenation.com/article/senate-republicans-dont-really-want-to-govern-in-the-era-of-trump/). If Democrats refuse to cooperate, this limits McConnell's ability to get through legislation.
1.1.8.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Yet McConnell assisted in passing [amazingly](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/19/politics/cnn-poll-tax-bill-opposition-grows/index.html) [unpopular](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/21/unpopular-gop-tax-bill-relative-deprivation-216158) tax legislation without any votes from the Democrats.
1.1.8.1.2.1.3.2. Con: On the contrary, McConnell put his support behind various Obamacare repeal and replace legislative initiatives, all of which were [incredibly](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/28/suffolk-poll-obamacare-trump-senate-health-care-plan/103249346/) [unpopular](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/06/senate-trumpcare-bill-still-disliked-by-pretty-much-everyone.html).
1.1.8.1.2.1.4. Pro: The [senate filibuster](https://people.howstuffworks.com/filibuster.htm) allows the Democrats to massively stall the passage of legislation.
1.1.8.1.2.1.4.1. Con: The filibuster is not a guarantee. If Democrats overuse the option, Republicans can [ban the use of filibusters](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/us/politics/filibuster-supreme-court-neil-gorsuch.html) for certain votes with a simple majority.
1.1.8.1.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: Democrats have [already abolished](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/us/politics/filibuster-supreme-court-neil-gorsuch.html) the use of filibusters for confirming nominees to certain executive positions, and they ran the risk of Republicans doing the same for Supreme Court nominations if Democrats had tried to block Neil Gorsuch.
1.1.8.1.2.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Banning the use of filibusters to hold up nominee confirmations is very different from banning the use of filibusters for legislation in general, which was its intended purpose.
1.1.8.1.2.1.4.1.2. Pro: Trump has [repeatedly called](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/2/15515834/filibuster-kill-abolish-nuclear-option-trump-mcconnell) for abolishing the filibuster rule, and will likely place pressure on the Senate to do exactly that.
1.1.8.1.2.1.4.1.2.1. Con: All the Democrats need are three Republicans to vote against the "nuclear option" for an attempt to abolish the filibuster to fail.
1.1.8.1.2.1.4.1.3. Con: The Republicans are unlikely to support the abolition of the [filibuster rule](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nuking-the-filibuster-may-hurt-republicans-in-the-long-run/) given their own frequent use of it during the Obama era, especially given that the Democrats may still win the 2018 and 2020 elections.
1.1.8.1.2.1.4.1.3.1. Con: Yet they still deployed the '[nuclear option](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-senate.html)' and lowered the threshold for advancing Supreme Court nominations from 60 votes to a simple majority.
1.1.8.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Senators can initiate a procedural filibuster to extend "debate" on a piece of legislation. [Cloture](https://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_index_subjects/Cloture_vrd.htm) requires 60 votes, 3/5 of the senate body, but Republicans only have 52 senators.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5. Con: President Trump can still achieve much of his agenda using executive orders. Not cooperating only harms the Democrats.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.1. Con: President Trump's executive orders have often faced sharp rebuke from the courts.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: His travel ban, now in its third incarnation, has faced court [injunctions](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-court/federal-judge-in-hawaii-expands-block-on-trump-travel-ban-idUSKBN1CQ0MI) each time.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.1.2. Pro: The Mexico border wall [may face legal challenges](http://uk.businessinsider.com/trump-border-wall-mexico-texas-private-land-use-2017-9?r=US&IR=T) from landowners.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.2. Con: Many of the most important elements of Trump's legislative agenda cannot be passed through executive orders.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: Trump's promise of [tax reform](https://www.taxjournal.com/articles/trump-and-big-six-kick-us-tax-reform-legislation-28092017) requires legislation to pass through both Congress and Senate.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.2.2. Pro: Trump has been [unable](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-27/donald-trump-senate-will-not-vote-on-obamacare-repeal/8991640) to repeal Obamacare, a central policy promise of his campaign, something he can't do using executive orders.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.2.2.1. Con: Failure to stop Obamacare through Congress did not stop President Trump from [issuing executive orders](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/upshot/what-did-trumps-health-care-executive-order-do.html) in order to make it "implode."
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.2.3. Pro: Much of Trump's objectives are closely linked with Steve Bannon's stated goal of "[deconstructing the administrative state.](http://billmoyers.com/story/deconstructing-administrative-state/)" The structure of the US government prevents massive changes from happening without legislative support.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.3. Con: If making executive orders helps Trump further his agenda in the way that he wants to, Democrats cooperating will not change that. He would likely make the executive orders anyway, but with a supposed blessing from the opposition.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.2.1.5.2.2.1.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.5. Pro: A significant part of Trump's trade policy has been, and is being, enacted through executive orders.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.5.1. Pro: Trump [withdrew](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/23/politics/trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal-withdrawal-trumps-first-executive-action-monday-sources-say/) from the TPP using an executive order.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.5.2. Pro: Trump may be able to [withdraw](https://www.law360.com/articles/960203) the US from NAFTA using an executive order.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.5.2.1. Con: There is actually [significant uncertainty](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/26/16505508/nafta-congress-block-trump-withdraw-trade-power) as to whether Congressional approval of withdrawal will be required or not, throwing uncertainty on Trump's ability to use executive orders to drive his economic agenda.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.6. Pro: Trump has used executive orders to push his environmental agenda.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.6.1. Pro: Trump is repealing and replacing the [Clean Power Plan](https://thinkprogress.org/trump-clean-power-plan-21baad0ebd19/), designed to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, using executive orders.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.6.2. Pro: Trump used an executive order to [roll back](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/climate/flooding-infrastructure-climate-change-trump-obama.html?_r=0) environmental regulations on developing infrastructure.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.6.3. Pro: Trump has [signed](http://executive order expands offshore drilling) an executive order that aims to expand offshore drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, as well as assess whether energy exploration can take place in marine sanctuaries in the Pacific and Atlantic.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.6.4. Pro: Trump revoked a regulation [protecting](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38695593) waterways from coal waste.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.6.4.1. Con: The Obama regulation was arbitrary because [other laws](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/water-enforcement), both on the federal and state levels, were already in place that did the same thing, hence why Trump's decision had support from [key Democrats](http://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2017/05/18/coal-state_democrats_quietly_push_agenda_in_senate.html) located in the midwest.
1.1.8.1.2.1.5.6.5. Pro: Obama passed these laws with executive orders, and not through Congress. Trump can therefore achieve his own environmental agenda by reversing Obama's executive orders and passing his own.
1.1.8.1.2.1.6. Pro: The Republican party have been accused of '[policy apathy](https://newrepublic.com/article/141722/republican-partys-deadly-policy-apathy)', where they simply don't focus on intricate policy making. Democrats not assisting in forming policy will mean that Republicans simply get less done.
1.1.8.1.2.1.6.1. Pro: This [lack of detail](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/donald-trump-policy-2016-hillary-clinton-214058) from the White House makes actual policy formation significantly difficult as [wide promises](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/24/trumps-endless-rallies-defeat-this-goal-commentary.html) are made without paying any attention to what the minutiae of the legislation will look like.
1.1.8.1.2.1.6.1.1. Pro: Trump's [focus](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/24/trumps-endless-rallies-defeat-this-goal-commentary.html) is on winning in 2020, and keeps his promises as broad as he can to appeal to his base. This does not assist in making actual detailed policy.
1.1.8.1.2.1.6.1.2. Pro: Trump himself understands [neither ideology nor policy](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/trump-isnt-a-pragmatist-he-doesnt-understand-ideology.html), and is completely unable to form legislation.
1.1.8.1.2.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Trump simply [does not understand](https://www.vox.com/2017/7/20/16003218/trump-nyt-interview-ignorance) how healthcare works.
1.1.8.1.2.1.6.2. Pro: The Republican party's approach to specific issues is incredibly vague, and has limited chance of ever crystallising into actual legislation.
1.1.8.1.2.1.6.2.1. Pro: When Senate Republicans are asked about the various healthcare bills proposed to repeal Obamacare, [none actually explain](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/16/15810524/senate-ahca-explain-please) how a bill would work, but simply make broad promises about solving all problems.
1.1.8.1.2.1.6.2.2. Pro: The Republican candidates for President in 2016 [simply did not](https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance) have detailed plans about how they would manage to reduce taxes, but simply tried to out-compete their opponents on who would lower them most.
1.1.8.1.2.1.6.3. Pro: In a Republican primary, making tough policy choices and trying to be substantive [does not pay off](https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/why-the-g-o-p-candidates-dont-do-substance); making unrealistic promises does. That means candidates partake in one-up-manship rather than formulating actual detailed policy that they can pass once in power.
1.1.8.1.2.1.6.4. Pro: Since the Republican Party is dysfunctional when it comes to forming policies, it is in the interest of the Democrats to refuse to co-operate. Allowing them to fail or not get policy passed makes them lose voters who are unsatisfied due to a lack of fulfilment of electoral promises.
1.1.8.1.2.1.6.4.1. Pro: These voters may choose to switch allegiance to the Democratic Party, thereby helping them in future elections.
1.1.8.1.2.1.6.4.2. Pro: In the instance where these voters have lost faith in the Republican Party but still do not want to vote Democrat, these voters may choose to not vote altogether. This is still a net benefit for the Democrats as the Republicans lose some support.
1.1.8.1.2.1.6.4.3. Pro: Having realized that a lack of bipartisanship translates into a lack of policy-making, these voters may choose to vote for relatively moderate Republicans.
1.1.8.1.2.1.6.4.3.1. Pro: In the instance where Democrats win, these Republicans can be especially useful in passing policy.
1.1.8.1.2.1.6.4.3.2. Pro: In the instance where Democrats lose, this situation is still better. Rather than an unhinging opponent, they have a moderate across the aisle. This moderate is likelier to field acceptable demands in negotiations, allowing for more legislation to be passed than in the status quo, consequently helping more Americans.
1.1.8.1.2.1.7. Pro: Republicans in bluer states or constituencies feel pressure to vote against the party line when the Democrats are united in opposition to something.
1.1.8.1.2.1.7.1. Pro: Prominent Democrats can take to the media and other channels to get the public to put pressure on these individuals.
1.1.8.1.2.1.7.2. Pro: [Susan Collins](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-mccain-collins-murkowski-voted-against-gop-health-care-bill-2017-7) \(R-Maine\) is the only Republican senator left in New England and felt intense pressure to vote against the Affordable Care Act Repeal, publicly citing the need for a bipartisan replacement plan
1.1.8.1.2.1.8. Pro: Given how [harmful](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/29/politics/president-trump-legislation/index.html) Trump's legislative agenda is, this is actually cause for Democrats to not support Trump.
1.1.8.2. Pro: If refusal to cooperate prevents the passing of legislation, Democrats will get a double win: not only will they prevent Republican legislation from passing, they will show that his '[aura of competence is a false one](https://hbr.org/2017/02/if-democrats-want-to-challenge-trump-they-need-a-new-strategy)'.
1.1.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.
1.1.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.
1.1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.2.2.
1.1.8.4. Con: Historically, Trump has [failed](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/23/why-trump-really-believes-hes-the-most-successful-president-ever-215063) at making deals far more than he has succeeded, yet his perception as a deal-maker persists. It is unlikely that the Democrats will be able to change this perception.
1.1.8.4.1. Pro: Trump [flopped](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/american-football/38662209) as an owner of a professional football team, effectively killing not only his own franchise but the league as a whole.
1.1.8.4.2. Pro: Trump has filed for [bankruptcy](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/21/hillary-clinton/yep-donald-trumps-companies-have-declared-bankrupt/) six times on completely separate businesses.
1.1.8.4.3. Pro: Trump bought an [airline](https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/articles/the-time-trump-bought-an-airline-and-crashed-it/) that existed for less than three years and ended up almost a quarter of a billion dollars in debt.
1.1.8.4.4. Pro: Trump has invested in beverages, video games, magazines, mortgage companies, steaks, travel sites, a university, and more; all of these business ventures [failed catastrophically](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/donald-trumps-13-biggest-business-failures-20160314), losing Trump many billions of dollars.
1.1.8.4.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.1.2.6.
1.1.8.4.6. Con: Most of Trump's failed business ventures were never scrutinised by the American public like his presidency: he will likely be far more accountable for his actions in the White House than when he was engaging in private business affairs away from the public eye.
1.1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.
1.1.8.6. Con: -> See 1.1.7.2.2.1.6.
1.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.2.1.
1.1.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.7.3.1.2.
1.2. Con: Democrats can weigh the costs and benefits of cooperation on a case-by-case basis. It is highly unlikely that cooperation will always turn out to be a bad idea, so rather than adopting a blanket policy, Democrats should reserve cooperation for the few cases where it is rational.
1.2.1. Con: Senator Mitch McConnell at the election of Obama said that he and the GOP would oppose President Obama and his administration.
1.2.2. Con: It is easier for the Democratic party to oppose Trump across all matters of legislation. If it became a question of cooperating on specific legislative issues and not others, Democrats could fracture, granting Trump easy legislative victories.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Democrats in red states may feel pressure to vote with Trump if the taboo on cooperation is removed by party leadership.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: If the pressure on Democrats in Republican states is strong, a 'taboo' on cooperation will not stop them from cooperating with Trump.
1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.
1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.7.
1.2.5. Pro: If cooperating with Trump has certain negative consequences, then Democrats will be aware of that, and can avoid cooperating whenever the negative consequences outweigh the benefits of cooperation. But it is unlikely that in every single possible case, the harms of cooperation will outweigh the benefits, so Democrats should keep their options open.
1.2.5.1. Con: Certain negative consequences are such that they [can not be predicted](http://www.dummies.com/education/politics-government/how-policies-can-have-unintended-consequences-in-washington-d-c/) at the time in which a compromise happens. Therefore, Democrats may not necessarily always be aware of all negative consequences.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Even if Democrats are not specifically aware of the potential negative consequences, they can make probabilistic calculations about the expected value of cooperating.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: It is also the case that never cooperating with Trump could itself have certain hidden negative consequences which could be taken into account in probabilistic calculation about the expected value of cooperating.
1.2.5.1.2. Con: This argument can be made about any form of cooperation, with any President or opposing party, but to say that no cooperation should ever occur is obviously wrong.
1.2.5.1.3. Pro: The [majority of Democrats](http://news.gallup.com/poll/207599/democrats-say-leaders-not-compromise-trump.aspx) \(57%\) nationally believe it is more important for their party's leaders in Congress to stick to their beliefs even if little gets done, rather than compromise with the Trump administration to enact policy changes. Given that Democrats cannot accurately predict how people will respond to co-operation with Trump, it would be unwise to risk losing voters.
1.2.5.1.3.1. Con: A more [recent poll](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/laurettabrown/2017/10/09/gallup-more-americans-prefer-leaders-compromise-rather-than-stick-to-principles-n2392603) contradicts this, stating that 62% of Democrats would prefer leaders to compromise over sticking to principles.
1.2.6. Con: A compromise necessarily benefits Trump too, otherwise there would be none. A compromise that benefits someone perceived as a sexist, homophobic and racist president is wrong in principle.
1.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.6.
1.2.6.2. Con: The perception that the character of the president is deeply flawed is [irrelevant](http://www.dailywire.com/news/18757/shapiro-national-review-more-and-more-trump-ben-shapiro#exit-modal) when the actual core policies he is proposing can be beneficial. The principle of compromising with a president of poor character is unimportant and irrelevant compared to pushing through policy that can actually benefit people's lives. If democrats can do this through compromise, they should therefore weight it as more important than whether or not Trump also benefits.
1.2.6.2.1. Pro: In a true democracy, policy for the people should be the priority. If Democrats have to risk giving Trump or the Republicans points on the board, so that the best policies can be put forward, then they should. Opposition for opposition's sake is undemocratic.
1.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: Trump offered a path for DACA immigrants to become citizens but Democrats are refusing to negotiate. Democrats are choosing to hurt the group they claim to support just to resist Trump.[Do Democrats even want an immigration deal?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/do-democrats-even-want-an-immigration-deal/2018/02/01/ece4f290-077d-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html?utm_term=.35b3f3c09d67)
1.2.6.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.
1.2.6.2.1.3. Pro: Members of Congress have a responsibility to represent their district. An obstructionist approach would reduce their ability to do so.
1.2.6.2.1.4. Con: The issue is that giving Republicans 'points on the board' risks keeping them in power, which, from the Democrats' perspective, would guarantee four more years of bad policy.
1.2.6.2.1.4.1. Con: If the Republicans "score points" by putting forward such good policies that the Democrats can vote for them despite their ad hominem hatred of Trump, then we are not going to have "4 more years of bad policies".
1.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.2.1.
1.3. Con: Refusing to cooperate with or obstructing the other party when they are in government violates democratic norms and principles.
1.3.1. Con: The question of legitimacy of Trump's Presidency has not been settled. The basis of working with an opposition President depends on the legitimacy of  the election process. The US has, in the past, in many instances, refused to recognize leaders of the countries where it suspected irregular elections. This perhaps, is the first instance, where its own elections are suspect. As an opposition party, Democrats should not cooperate with Trump till his legitimacy is proven.
1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.3.3. Con: Blanket obstructionist politics are justified if the minority feels the majority or the executive has been elected on a wholly objectionable platform.
1.3.3.1. Con: Yet the minority's platform was rejected by the public. A complete lack of compromise will prevent the minority party from re-evaluating their own policies such that they can win elections in the future.
1.3.3.2. Con: American politics is sufficiently polarised that the loser in any election will likely feel that the winner has been elected on an objectionable platform. Acceptance of this principle would entail that parties are never obligated to cooperate with each other.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: The Democrat/Republican split [on abortion](http://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/) allows both parties to view each other as possessing deeply immoral views.
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: An [increasing percentage](http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-partisan-polarization-20140611-story.html) of Americans see the other political party as a threat to the country's wellbeing.
1.3.3.2.3. Con: Cooperating with Trump normalises his Presidency and everything he stands for, something which Democrats should be opposed to.
1.3.3.2.3.1. Con: Democrats must cooperate with Trump in order to forward their legislative agenda, an agenda that stands in opposition to the ideals Trump espouses.
1.3.3.2.3.1.1. Con: Any legislation which Trump supports will always be in line with his own ideals.
1.3.3.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Trump is unlikely to support legislation that Democrats can claim to be their own.
1.3.3.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: One of the major sources of Trump's support is the fact that he is [anti-establishment](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/11/09/election-analysis-hillary-clinton-donald-trump/93198882/). Co-operating with the Democratic establishment is not in his self-interest.
1.3.3.2.3.1.1.2.1. Con: If co-operating with the Democratic Party establishment is not in his interest then nothing will happen. This thesis becomes relevant in the instance that Trump is willing to co-operate.
1.3.3.2.3.1.1.3. Con: Trump's ideals and values are relatively [malleable](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/president-trumps-first-100-days/here-are-new-policy-stances-donald-trump-has-taken-election-n684946)- he might change his mind and support policies which are typically more in line with Democratic thinking.
1.3.3.2.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.
1.3.3.2.3.1.2. Pro: Passing legislation will strengthen the position of the Democrats in future elections.
1.3.3.2.3.1.2.1. Con: Working with Trump may alienate voters on the far left, who may gravitate towards third party candidates such as Jill Stein, or abstain from being involved politically.
1.3.3.2.3.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.4.1.
1.3.3.2.3.1.2.3. Con: Legislation passed while the Republicans are in the majority will be credited to them, not the Democrats.
1.3.3.2.3.1.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.
1.3.3.2.3.1.2.3.2. Con: Legislation passed will be credited to the legislators. A polarized or politicized view of this \(claiming a mixed group, with different opinions works together\) would be better for the country and raise the "re-elect-ability" of those in office.
1.3.3.2.3.1.2.3.3. Pro: In 2018 and 2020, voters will ask themselves whether they are better off then they were in 2016. If the answer is yes, even if in reality that is due to Democratic party support for legislation, voters will respond to perceived Republican success in governance.
1.3.3.2.3.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.1.1.
1.3.3.2.3.1.2.5. Pro: Cooperating with Trump specifically on the issues of infrastructure investment and protection of American jobs would undermine the idea that the Democrats have abandoned blue-collar workers. If this line of attack was less potent for Trump, it would increase Democratic chances in crucial [states like Pennsylvania](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/25/blue-collar-democrats-to-party-its-still-the-economy-stupid.html) in the 2020 election.
1.3.3.2.3.1.2.5.1. Pro: The Trump administration has already proven itself quite ineffective in drafting and passing legislation. This means that Democrats could take the lead on these policies, and therefore a large share of the credit.
1.3.3.2.3.1.2.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.2.1.6.
1.3.3.2.3.1.2.5.1.2. Con: It is unlikely that the GOP will allow Democrats to lead the way in drafting legislation when they control both the House and the Senate, as well as the White House. It is far more likely that they will draft a bill which could, at best, be moderated by Democrats.
1.3.3.2.3.1.2.6. Pro: Democrats need to show voters that they will be able to get things done in the majority.
1.3.3.2.3.1.3. Pro: The Republicans have control of both houses of Congress and the White House. Any potential legislation will likely need backing from the President as a result.
1.3.3.2.3.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.8.
1.3.3.2.3.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.
1.3.3.2.3.1.6. Con: By threatening to cooperate with the Democrats, Trump can [scare](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/26/politics/tax-reform-trump-work-with-democrats/index.html) members of his own party into compromising with him. This leverage allows Trump to force through more radical or unpopular legislation moderate Republicans might otherwise not allow.
1.3.3.2.3.1.6.1. Con: It is unlikely that Democrats would support legislation that is too conservative or too far right for moderate Republicans. This means that it would be implausible for Trump to use the threat of cooperating with Democrats in order to pass this kind of legislation.
1.3.3.2.3.1.7. Pro: Trump has few true ideals of his own other than authoritarianism and enriching himself and his family. Ironically, this means he may be persuaded to embrace more moderate positions if this would give him the [appearance of a legislative win](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/18/trumps-true-ideology-has-been-revealed/?utm_term=.f008476cb415). While this too has its risks for Democrats, it could be worthwhile in the case of truly vital legislation such as a clean Dreamers bill.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8. Con: The Democrats should focus their attempts to cooperate with the Republicans outside of the Trump administration instead of trying to cooperate with the Trump presidency.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.1. Pro: Trump's unpopularity with the Republican Party could open up Republicans who oppose Trump to cooperate with Democrats to pass legislation.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.1.1. Pro: [Trump's](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/republican-party-approval-ratings-congress-trump) historically low ratings are having a negative effect on down-ballot Republicans.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.1.1.1. Pro: [Midterm elections](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-normal-rules-of-politics-still-apply-to-trump-and-to-republicans-in-congress/) are often thought of as referendums on the sitting president, and Trump's ratings directly affect Republicans' ability to get elected in 2018.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.1.2. Pro: Donald Trump has personally attacked 1 in 5 Republican [senators](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/24/politics/trump-gop-senators-corker/index.html).
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.1.2.1. Pro: Directly attacking Republican senators could alienate them from his administration, paving the way for cooperation with Democrats.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.1.3. Pro: Plenty of Republicans, such as [John McCain and Bob Corker](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/17/politics/bob-corker-john-mccain-speech/index.html), are starting to condemn President Trump. Lots of individuals on the right sympathize with anti-Trump rhetoric.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.1.3.1. Con: Only a tiny minority of Republicans have been willing to criticise Trump; the majority support him, so refusal to cooperate will inevitably be polarising.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.1.3.1.1. Pro: The only Republicans who have been willing to oppose Trump are those whose political career is ending soon: [Bob Corker](http://time.com/4958159/bob-corker-reelection-2018/) and [Jeff Flake](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/jeff-flake-arizona.html?_r=0) because their prior opposition to Trump means they will not win reelection, and [John McCain](http://fortune.com/2017/09/25/mccain-brain-cancer-prognosis-poor/) because he has brain cancer. So the fact that they are willing to stand up to Trump does not mean there is a widespread willingness to do so.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.1.3.2. Con: John McCain and Bob Corker have significantly low favorability among the Republican demographic and actually have [higher favorability with Democrat voters](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/358250-mccain-better-liked-by-dems-than-republicans-poll). So using people like John McCain as an example of "lots of individuals" on the right sympathizing with anti-Trump rhetoric is inaccurate.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.1.3.3. Con: Even if certain people on the right disapprove of Trump, that does not mean they will approve of a Democratic policy of total obstruction.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.2. Pro: Successfully cooperating with Republicans could break some of the existing stigma against bipartisanship, leading to a more productive political landscape.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.2.1. Pro: A recent [study](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/us/politics/partisanship-republicans-democrats-pew-research.html) showed that US partisanship is the highest in decades.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.2.2. Pro: A Democrat was [punished by his own party](http://www.maciverinstitute.com/2017/07/pro-free-speech-dem-ostracized-punished-for-working-with-republicans/) for cooperating with Republicans; clearly there is stigma against this within parties.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.2.3. Pro: Since Americans want bipartisan cooperation, they will only look favourably upon those elected officials who cooperate.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.2.3.1. Pro: Americans [want bipartisan cooperation](http://thehill.com/homenews/news/320229-poll-americans-want-democrats-to-work-with-trump). They are unlikely to look at opposition as principled, especially not in a positive way.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.3. Con: Even if democrats follow this path, the existence of the presidential veto means that cooperation with Trump would still be necessary at some point in order to get legislation signed into law.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.3.1. Pro: If the president vetoes legislation, a two-thirds majority in both houses is required to pass it. It seems implausible that a large enough coalition between Republicans and Democrats could be found in such a situation.
1.3.3.2.3.1.8.3.2. Con: In order to pass legislation through both houses, Democrats will need some support from House and Senate Republicans. It would therefore be against Trump's interest to veto Democratic legislation, because doing so would alienate members of his own party, whose votes he might need in the future.
1.3.3.2.3.1.9. Con: Democrats can forward their agenda on the state level and focus on local politics instead. Not cooperating with Trump does not mean that they cannot pass policy.
1.3.3.2.3.1.9.1. Pro: California, for instance, just [legally recognized](http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/355806-california-first-state-to-legally-recognize-third-gender-option) a third gender.
1.3.3.2.3.1.9.2. Pro: Gridlock in Washington presents an opportunity for Democrats to focus on local politics, where they've historically been rather [weak](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/the-ideological-reasons-why-democrats-have-neglected-local-politics/512024/).
1.3.3.2.3.1.9.2.1. Pro: Having strong or compelling candidates down ballot is an incentive for voters to come to the polls, when they may not have felt motivated otherwise.
1.3.3.2.3.1.9.2.2. Pro: Republican legislatures have been trying to pass laws which would tie [Presidential electors](https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/tying-presidential-electors-gerrymandered-congressional-districts-will-sabotage-elections) to \(gerrymandered\) individual districts, in an effort to skew election results to benefit Republican Presidential candidates. Without significant gains on the local level this will be impossible to stop.
1.3.3.2.3.1.9.2.3. Pro: Republicans picked up [over 800 seats](https://newrepublic.com/article/138897/democrats-biggest-disaster) in state legislatures while conducting a campaign of obstructionism in Washington aimed at President Obama.
1.3.3.2.3.1.9.2.3.1. Pro: The party that controls the entire government is the one that is [blamed](https://www.brookings.edu/research/president-barack-obamas-first-two-years-policy-accomplishments-political-difficulties/) for continuing partisan wrangling. Continuing obstructionism is likely to get Democrats elected in local legislatures.
1.3.3.2.3.1.9.2.4. Pro: State legislatures and Governors have a great deal of control over [redistricting](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/national-overview-redistricting-who-draws-lines), which will happen after the 2020 census. Without major local electoral gains by Democrats, Republicans will be able to gerrymander districts in the states in which they control large majorities.
1.3.3.2.3.1.9.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.
1.3.3.2.3.1.9.3. Con: Democrats have [relatively low](http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/306736-dems-hit-new-low-in-state-legislatures) control of local legislatures, so their ability to pass local policy is limited.
1.3.3.2.3.2. Pro: Refusing to work with Trump signals to the country that he is unfit to serve.
1.3.3.2.3.2.1. Con: Voters who the Democrats need to win back in the next presidential election will not be persuaded by a party they do not support merely signalling that a president, whom they did support, is unfit to serve.
1.3.3.2.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.
1.3.3.2.3.2.2. Pro: In many countries, parties refuse to cooperate with far right candidates or parties in an attempt to de-legitimize them.
1.3.3.2.3.2.2.1. Con: This only works because far-right candidates and parties in these countries are not in power.
1.3.3.2.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: It would be seen as ludicrous if Hungarian politicians refused to work with [Viktor Orbán](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Viktor-Orban) or Polish politicians with [Law and Justice](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/magazine/the-party-that-wants-to-make-poland-great-again.html).
1.3.3.2.3.2.2.2. Con: European countries are multi-party states, so rejecting far right candidates is possible when there are multiple other options to choose from. That does not apply to America where rejection of the right-wing party means your only other option is the left-leaning Democrats.
1.3.3.2.3.2.2.3. Pro: The [Sweden Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_Democrats), a far right and nationalist party, has won a significant number of seats in their parliament due to rising anti-immigrant sentiment. All major parties in Sweden have refused to cooperate with them, however.
1.3.3.2.3.2.2.4. Pro: [During the 2017 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_for_Freedom#2017.E2.80.93present), all major Dutch parties announced that they would refuse to form a coalition with Geert Wilder's far-right Party of Freedom.
1.3.3.2.3.2.3. Con: Donald Trump won the election on an [anti-elitist platform](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/445255/thoughts-about-spinning-our-president). If the Democrats continue to push the narrative that he is unfit to serve, this will only make them look more elitist and play into his platform.
1.3.3.2.3.2.4. Con: As a strategy, attempting to portray Trump as unfit for the Presidency, either because of his character, intellect, or ignorance about government, has [simply not worked](https://hbr.org/2017/02/if-democrats-want-to-challenge-trump-they-need-a-new-strategy) for the Democrats.
1.3.3.2.3.2.4.1. Pro: If anything, such a strategy could simply [amplify](https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-so-many-people-dont-get-about-the-u-s-working-class) the class resentments between Middle America Trump supporters and the coastal and urban elite.
1.3.3.2.3.2.5. Pro: Democrats in the House of Representatives brought a '[no confidence](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world-0/us-politics/donald-trump-house-democrats-president-impeach-no-confidence-resolution-a7850006.html)' resolution against Trump, detailing 88 reasons for why he wasn't fit to serve as President. To then start cooperating with him seems hypocritical.
1.3.3.2.3.3. Con: Cooperation does not require normalisation. Democrats can be vocal critics of Trump while still cooperating with him on certain legislative priorities.
1.3.3.2.3.3.1. Con: Trump is unlikely to cooperate with a party that continuously and vocally criticises him. If Democrats decide to cooperate with Trump, this will require moderating their criticism of him.
1.3.3.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: The difference between Trump himself and his administration should be clearly defined. That way, all members of the political spectrum could act accordingly when not cooperating with the President, rather than the administration.
1.3.3.2.3.3.2. Pro: Democrats have been fiercely criticising Trump since he began running for President, yet they've still managed to cooperate with him on a couple of occasions.
1.3.3.2.3.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.7.1.
1.3.3.2.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.
1.3.3.2.3.5. Con: Democrats should behave as normally as possible in order to draw attention to how anomalous Trump's presidency is. Abnormal behaviour, like a refusal to cooperate, draws attention away from the abnormality of the administration itself.
1.3.3.2.3.5.1. Pro: Democratic obstruction would be seen by many voters as a self-interested move rather than a principled resistance to the Trump administration.
1.3.3.2.3.5.1.1. Con: There is no reason why voters won't see Democrats opposition as a [principled](https://www.arlnow.com/2017/01/19/progressive-voice-principled-resistance-to-trump/) one, especially when Trump opposes everything the Democrats stand for.
1.3.3.2.3.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.7.
1.3.3.2.3.5.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.3.1.8.2.3.1.
1.3.3.2.3.5.2. Pro: Democratic obstruction would allow right-leaning commentators to focus on the actions of Democrats, thus drawing attention away from Trump's actions.
1.3.3.2.3.5.2.1. Con: Right-leaning commentators would criticise the Democrats and blame them for a lack of legislative achievements regardless of their actions. It is unlikely that news outlets such as Fox News will start criticising the Trump administration just because Democrats decided to cooperate.
1.3.3.2.3.6. Con: Democrats should represent their constituencies, and vote accordingly. If, however, there is a thing that Trump himself, not the administration, does that is unforgivable, Democrats, Republicans and Independents should call him out on it \(case in point, his [tweets on Flynn](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/02/politics/trump-tweet-flynn-firing-fbi-reaction/index.html)\).
1.3.3.2.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.3.1.8.1.3.
1.3.3.3. Pro: Members of Congress have a sworn duty to uphold the constitution, but are not sworn to create, enact, or support any specific legislation.
1.3.4. Pro: By refusing to cooperate, Democrats will erode norms of cooperation and make it more likely that Republicans will obstruct Democratic presidencies in the future.
1.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.5.2.
1.3.4.2. Pro: The Republican obstructionist strategy was largely driven by current [Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/01/strict-obstructionist/308344/). If Democrats adopt the same strategy, they risk institutionalising obstructionism as the de-facto strategy of the opposition party, something that would be incredibly difficult to reverse, if at all possible.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: The fact that norms of obstructionism were introduced by Republicans indicates that Republicans are likely to engage in obstructionism no matter what Democrats do.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Con: Just because Republicans introduced norms of obstructionism does not mean that they will needlessly engage in it.
1.3.4.2.1.2. Con: The fact that the obstructionist approach was [largely designed and led by Senator Mitch McConnell](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/01/strict-obstructionist/308344/) indicates that the approach has not been institutionalised within the party. When he leaves, the party may well change tack.
1.3.4.2.1.2.1. Con: On the contrary, the fact that the Republican party [adopted obstructionist tactics wholeheartedly](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/republican-party-obstructionism-victory-trump-214498) and the fact that it brought them such clear electoral results means they are unlikely to abandon the approach after the departure of McConnell.
1.3.4.3. Con: Norms of cooperation in the American Congress are already pretty much gone in the status quo, replaced by norms of intense [partisanship](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/republican-party-obstructionism-victory-trump-214498). This is not a tipping point.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: In 2013, the Republican Senate [forced a government shutdown](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/10/republicans-shut-down-the-government-for-nothing/280611/) over a minor change to Obamacare.
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: Voting patterns in the House of Representatives [indicate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/23/a-stunning-visualization-of-our-divided-congress/?utm_term=.193f79a70ffe) significantly increased polarization; Democrats and Republicans rarely vote together.
1.3.4.3.3. Pro: Congress has been progressively [polarised](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/polarized-politics-in-congress-began-in-the-1970s-and-has-been-getting-worse-ever-since/) since the 1970s. Polarisation will continue increasing regardless of what the Democrats do as it is rooted in other factors.
1.3.4.3.3.1. Con: Just because polarisation happens because of other factors, does not mean that efforts should not be made to close off one avenue that perpetuates it.
1.3.4.3.3.2. Pro: The parties’ electoral coalitions have become increasingly distinct racially. The nonwhite share of the U.S. electorate has doubled since the early 1990s and this trend is certain to continue based on the racial make-up of the youngest and oldest age groups in the population. Due to the preference of nonwhite voters for the Democrats, the growth of the nonwhite electorate has led to an increasing racial divide between the Democratic and Republican electoral coalitions. \([Abramovitz, pg 4](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/archived/Bicameralism%20papers/abromowitz3.pdf)\)
1.3.4.3.3.2.1. Pro: The combination of increased geographic polarization and increased party loyalty in voting means that it is now much more difficult for a candidate from the minority party to win a Senate election. Fewer senators represent swing states or states that favor the opposing party while more senators represent states that are relatively safe for their own party. As a result, fewer senators need to worry about appealing to voters who identify with the opposing party. [\(Abramovitz, pg 5\)](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/archived/Bicameralism%20papers/abromowitz3.pdf)
1.3.4.3.3.3. Pro: The parties’ electoral coalitions have become increasingly distinct ideologically as a result of a gradual ideological realignment within the electorate. Democratic Senate voters have become increasingly liberal while Republican Senate voters have become increasingly conservative.[\(Abramovitz, pg 5\)](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/archived/Bicameralism%20papers/abromowitz3.pdf)
1.3.4.3.3.3.1. Pro: Increased ideological polarization of the Democratic and Republican parties took place during the Reagan and post-Reagan eras. Clearer differences between the parties' ideological positions made it easier for citizens to choose a party identification based on their policy preferences. [\(Abramovitz and Saunders, pg 4\)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.649.2675&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
1.3.4.3.3.4. Pro: Due to growing racial and ideological differences between the Democratic and Republican electoral coalitions, party loyalty and straight ticket voting have increased in Senate elections. This increase in party loyalty at the individual level means that state partisanship is now a stronger determinant of the outcomes of Senate elections than in the past and that winning candidates’ electoral coalitions are more party-based than in the past. [\(Abramovitz, pg 5\)](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/archived/Bicameralism%20papers/abromowitz3.pdf)
1.3.4.3.3.4.1. Pro: As a result of ideological and racial differences, geographic polarization has increased. Although the overall balance of power between the parties in the nation has been relatively close, the number of states dominated by one party has increased while the number of evenly balanced states has decreased. \([Abramovitz, pg 5](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/archived/Bicameralism%20papers/abromowitz3.pdf)\)
1.3.4.3.3.5. Pro: Senate elections have become increasingly nationalized. In choosing a Senate candidate, voters are increasingly influenced by their opinions about the national political situation and especially their opinions about the president’s performance. Therefore the polarisation of national politics directly effects polarisation at the state level. [\(Abramovitz, pg 6\)](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/archived/Bicameralism%20papers/abromowitz3.pdf)
1.3.4.3.3.6. Con: A refusal to co-operate with Trump will reinforce the causes of polarization that have been mentioned.
1.3.4.3.3.7. Con: Making deals with Trump, a candidate who has been championed by the other end of the spectrum, will be a powerful show of bipartisanship which will help combat the current trend.
1.3.4.3.3.7.1. Pro: The only way to stop partisanship is to normalize working across the isle.
1.3.4.3.3.7.1.1. Pro: People are often influenced by their leaders about what is acceptable or normal.
1.3.4.3.4. Pro: Obama passed many major regulations through [executive orders](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/us/politics/obama-era-legacy-regulation.html?_r=0), bypassing normal mechanisms of bipartisan cooperation entirely.
1.3.4.3.5. Con: Even if the American Congress has declined into partisanship, Democrats should attempt to reverse the trend rather than give into it.
1.3.5. Pro: Not allowing Trump to govern effectively prevents him from representing those millions of Americans who voted for him. This is a direct affront to what democracy stands for.
1.3.5.1. Con: Democratic principles also require the Democrats to represent the millions of American voters who voted for their candidate. If 'allowing Trump to govern effectively' consists of capitulating to his agenda, then they are failing to do so.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: Members of Congress are sworn to uphold the Constitution "without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion." As such, while they represent their constituent interests, they are not bound by their constituent interests in their service in government, but are instead bound by their constitutional duty.
1.3.5.2. Con: The separation of powers means that the Congress must seek consensus on the means of government, rather than the act of government itself. The President is allowed to govern as he sees fit, but must obtain the means, particularly the financial means, to implement policy. If Congress cannot agree upon said means, this does not unfairly limit the President's authority, but merely does not extend his authority with any new power.
1.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.2.1.
1.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.9.
1.3.8. Pro: Democratic systems of government are based on a cooperative, rather than a purely adversarial, form of politics. It is expected that parties will accept losses graciously and still cooperate with their opponents.
1.3.8.1. Pro: When parties or candidates win elections, they win a mandate from the people to pass their policies and institute their ideas in legislation. The party that loses should acknowledge that mandate.
1.3.8.1.1. Con: The idea of a mandate from the people for President Trump when more people voted for Hillary Clinton seems absurd.
1.3.8.1.1.1. Con: The election was conducted under rules that both sides agreed to; the Democrats cannot legitimately object to the electoral setup after having lost.
1.3.8.1.1.1.1. Con: Even if Democrats should concede that Trump won fairly, this does not mean that he has a moral mandate to govern.
1.3.9. Con: Trump's presidency is so unusual and anomalous that standard principles and norms of democracy should not apply.
1.3.9.1. Con: The norms and principles of a Democracy should not be waived for any sitting president. Doing so would cause a precedent of obstructionism for any future president by the opposing political party. The optimal option here would be for both sides to compromise on key issues.
1.3.9.2. Pro: Trump [himself](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/donald-trump-democratic-norms/508469/) disrespects and violates many democratic norms, like respecting the press, telling the truth, or accepting the results of elections.
1.3.9.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.1.
1.3.9.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.
1.3.9.2.3. Con: There is no democratic norm to suggest that the sitting president ought to get along with the press, especially when the press has been passing along [erroneous information about the current presidency](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/business/media/cnn-retraction-trump-scaramucci.html). If we are judging the norms of a presidency based on the truthfulness of the sitting president then doesn't that make [previous administrations](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-keep-it/) aberrations as well? The Left is actively trying to subvert the [results of the 2016 election](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/the-lefts-hypocrisy-on-accepting-election-results/article/2607121) and therefore does not respect the results.
1.3.9.2.4. Con: Just because Trump violates democratic norms doesn't mean Democrats should do the same. Democrats should be more responsible.
1.3.9.2.4.1. Con: Co-operation with a President who violates democratic norms is harmful to democracy and Democrats therefore should not do it.
1.3.9.2.4.1.1. Pro: Trump has said [multiple times](http://time.com/5008823/donald-trump-russia-investigation-democrats/) that the Justice Department should investigate Clinton and the Democratic Party. Not co-operating with a President who wants opponents to be investigated for no reason at all is justified and does not violate democratic norms.
1.3.9.2.4.1.2. Pro: If not co-operating with a President who does not follow democratic norms and principles is wrong, then any attempt at impeachment must logically also be wrong. But, impeachment and non co-operation can be forms of protecting democracy.
1.3.9.2.4.1.3. Pro: Trump has tried to [hinder](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/eric-holder-trump-hindering-mueller-investigation-creates-issues-of-constitutional-and-criminal-dimension/article/2629310) the Russia investigation. A President who tries to strip away fundamental principles of democracy like accountability, should not be worked with.
1.3.9.3. Pro: Norms and principles require mutual adherence. If Republicans do not adhere to the normal principles of democracy, then Democrats should not be expected to adhere to them either.
1.3.10. Con: Democrats have a moral mandate to do what their base wants them to do. Given that their base overwhelmingly disapproves of Trump, they ought not to cooperate with him.
1.3.10.1. Pro: Trump has an approval rating of [8%](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/20/politics/democrats-trump-approval-history/index.html) from Democratic voters.
1.3.10.2. Pro: 47% of Democrats [believe](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/us-liberals-donald-trump-supporters-half-same-room-hillary-clinton-republicans-democrats-a7853661.html) that if a friend supported Trump, it would put a strain on their friendship. If this is the attitude towards Trump voters, there is clear distaste for Trump himself.
1.3.10.3. Con: Disapproval of Trump is not the same as not wanting cooperation. Democrat voters can despise Trump but still believe that cooperation is a good thing.
1.3.10.3.1. Pro: [52% of Democratic voters](http://http://thehill.com/homenews/news/320229-poll-americans-want-democrats-to-work-with-trump) think that the Democratic Party should work with Trump on areas of agreement.
1.3.10.3.1.1. Con: A 52/48 split is not exactly a ringing endorsement of this approach; almost as many Democrats oppose it as favour it.
1.3.11. Con: The American system of government is structurally designed to allow the minority party to keep the majority party in check.
1.3.11.1. Con: The American system was designed to allow the minority party to prevent or alter specific proposals they find objectionable, not adopt a blanket policy of obstruction.
1.3.11.1.1. Pro: George Washington warned about [partisanship](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp) in his farewell address.
1.3.11.2. Pro: The founders [designed](https://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/primary-source-documents/the-federalist-papers/federalist-papers-no-51/) the branches of government and introduced checks and balances to avoid a tyranny of the majority.
1.3.12. Pro: Elected officials, in order to truly represent their constituents, are expected to make changes based on what is best, not the party affiliated with those changes.
1.3.12.1. Con: Co-operating with the Trump administration may not necessarily be for the best.
1.3.12.1.1. Pro: Cooperation with Trump will require trading away key Democratic priorities; this should be avoided at all costs.
1.3.12.1.1.1. Pro: The Trump administration is far more conservative and extreme than previous Republican administrations. The vast majority of its policies so far contradict fundamental principles of the Democratic Party.
1.3.12.1.1.1.1. Pro: Trump's policies thus far include attempting to ban Muslim refugees from the United States and putting [more than one million people](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/23/trumps-obamacare-ad-cuts-will-slash-enrollment-by-more-than-one-million.html) out of health coverage.
1.3.12.1.1.1.2. Con: This is not necessarily true. In fact, Democrats and Republicans may be [about to strike a deal](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/24/dreamers-immigrants-republicans-senate-244082) on DACA.
1.3.12.1.1.1.3. Con: Trump has contradicted Republican orthodoxy by expressing relatively liberal stances on issues like [gay marriage](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/trump-says-he-s-fine-gay-marriage-60-minutes-interview-n683606) and [foreign policy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/11/trump-foreign-policy-national-security-defense-spending). His administration is not necessarily more conservative than past Republican administrations.
1.3.12.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Even if he has commented positively on gay marriage, the Trump administration has [severely](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-transgender-workers-discrimination-law-memo-jeff-sessions-justice-department-a7985171.html) [limited](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/25/politics/trump-transgender-military/index.html) trans rights.
1.3.12.1.1.1.3.2. Con: Although Trump's foreign policy is not strictly conservative, it is still [contrary to](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/01/trump-sticks-to-a-protectionist-isolationist-script-in-first-big-speech/) Democratic foreign policy.
1.3.12.1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: A huge part of Trump's foreign policy strategy has involved seeking closer and more cordial relations with [Russia and Vladimir Putin](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/07/09/trump-has-picked-americas-enemies-in-russia-over-its-friends-in-europe/). This is something that the Democratic Party is opposed to.
1.3.12.1.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Trump has [weakened](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38984947) [commitments](https://thediplomat.com/2017/06/the-truth-about-trumps-asia-commitment-problem/) to defense partners, moves which have been criticised by Democrats like [Barack Obama](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/obama-trump-nato-foreign-policy-president).
1.3.12.1.1.1.3.2.3. Pro: Hillary Clinton [has criticised](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/hillary-clinton-trump-un-speech-north-korea-totally-destroy-general-assembly-nuclear-weapons-a7957086.html) Trump's attitude towards North Korea.
1.3.12.1.1.2. Pro: Refusing to cooperate allows moderate Republicans such as John McCain to gain massive [leverage](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/25/16543314/flake-corker-mccain-leverage), because their votes make the difference between bills passing or failing on the floor. This forces the Republicans to pass watered down or more moderate legislation.
1.3.12.1.1.3. Pro: 57% of Republicans [think](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/11/14/morning-plum-democrats-want-compromise-republicans-dont-thats-bad-for-democrats/?utm_term=.e9dc83cb8f4a) that their leaders should be more conservative than they are now; cooperation with Trump would require accepting positions which are at odds with Democratic ideals.
1.3.12.1.1.4. Con: Our nation was built on a system of compromise, and that is just the nature of living in a world of opposing viewpoints. You can do your best to share what you think, but that doesn't mean you'll always get things the way you want.
1.3.12.1.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.3.12.1.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.3.12.1.1.6. Con: Refusing to cooperate effectively trades away a Democratic priority by allowing Republicans to pass unmoderated legislation.
1.3.12.1.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.2.1.
1.3.12.1.1.6.2. Con: If Republicans can pass a particular piece of legislation without Democratic support, they are likely to do so whether or not Democrats are willing to cooperate, since they do not wish to moderate their own legislation.
1.3.12.1.1.6.2.1. Con: Republicans will be willing to moderate legislation they can pass by themselves since they will need the assistance of Democrats in passing other legislation that their own party is not united on.
1.3.12.1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
1.4. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.3.1.
1.5. Con: Refusal to cooperate with Trump will polarise the American public even more.
1.5.1. Pro: Refusal to cooperate will make Republicans more radically opposed to and distrustful of Democrats.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Even if Democrats win majorities in the subsequent election cycle, Republicans are likely to actively oppose proposed pieces of legislation as a consequence of their own experience with the Democrats.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: This is likely to be true regardless of whether Democrats cooperate. The entire Republican strategy from 2009 through 2016 was to obstruct Democratic legislation and policy.
1.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.5.2.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Republicans will be able to claim that Democrats have betrayed the principles of democratic governance by obstructing the party in power.
1.5.1.3.1. Con: Democrats were able to claim the same thing about Republicans in the run up to 2016, but Republicans were still able to keep the House and Senate and win the Presidency.
1.5.2. Pro: Increased polarisation among the American public creates an electoral incentive for both Democrats and Republicans to be less willing to make compromises so as to appease their bases. This means subsequent administrations are likely to be highly dysfunctional.
1.5.2.1. Con: Compromise isn't necessary for efficacy. Almost every major Obama-era initiative, from the stimulus package to Obamacare, passed the Congress with almost entirely united Republican [opposition](https://www.brookings.edu/research/president-barack-obamas-first-two-years-policy-accomplishments-political-difficulties/).
1.5.2.1.1. Con: Republican opposition led to a [two-week government shutdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_shutdown_in_the_United_States#2013) in 2013.
1.5.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.4.
1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.2.1.5.2.
1.5.4. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.3.
1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.5.1.1.
1.5.6. Con: Trump's agenda is polarization. If Democrats cooperate now, he will only pursue more extreme policy to maintain the uproar.
1.5.6.1. Con: Many of Trump's proposals, particularly regarding healthcare reforms, were pretty moderate and tried to preserve things that were important to Democrats. The recent attempt for a "skinny repeal" for instance was [Trump's attempt to remove](https://www.axios.com/heres-whats-in-skinny-repeal-2466204086.html) the harmful aspects of Obamacare that hurt many Americans while simultaneously keeping some of its protections. Arguably this would have been a step in the right direction that could have opened up more options to either fix or completely replace Obamacare.
1.5.6.2. Pro: Trump's strongest support comes from an energised and angry base. Given that maintaining this depends on portraying the democrats as the enemy and anti-American, his incentive will always be to push the [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) even further to the right if the Democrats themselves move right in order to compromise.
1.5.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.
1.5.8. Con: This assumes that all Republicans completely support Trump. If Trump does not have the complete support of either the Republican voter base or of elected Republicans, opposition to Trump by Democrats will not polarise the American public.
1.5.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.3.1.8.1.3.
1.5.8.2. Con: Even if a few Republicans in Congress don't agree with Trump and are willing to side with Democrats, that doesn't mean that that opposition won't polarize the American public. Arguably John McCain's opposition to Trump has polarized the country even further, despite Trump trying to pass similar legislation that 4-8 years ago [McCain had promised](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/09/27/john-mccain-ran-repealing-obamacare-he-broke-his-promise-robert-robb-column/708114001/) to do \(repeal Obamacare\).
1.5.8.2.1. Pro: Republicans like McCain further polarized the country because they also want to take an all or nothing approach like the Democrats. [McCain wants a full repeal on Obamacare](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/22/john-mccain-obamacare-repeal-opposition-243036) and thus refused the recent skinny repeal which would have only repealed a few parts of the law.
1.5.8.3. Pro: Even the Republicans who support Trump, such as Paul Ryan, are [losing faith](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/opinion/republican-support-donald-trump.html?_r=0) in him.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.9.1.
1.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.12.1.1.
1.8. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.3.
