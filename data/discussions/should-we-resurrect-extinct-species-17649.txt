Discussion Title: Should We Resurrect Extinct Species?

1. Mankind should resurrect extinct species.
1.1. Pro: Resurrection would unlock incredible opportunities to learn about our planet, the nature of life, and where we come from.
1.1.1. Con: We would first have to understand our planet and the nature of life to be able to resurrect a species.
1.2. Con: Such species became extinct simply by process of natural selection. To de-extinct them would be to go against the laws of nature.
1.2.1. Con: Tetrapods above 25 kilos, especially dinosaurs, where extinct by a [meteroite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event) rather than natural selection.
1.2.2. Con: Humans drove many species to extinction. This process is not natural and did not come about due to natural selection, but due to intentional acts of mankind.
1.2.2.1. Pro: [Humans](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/64542/20150630/humans-cause-of-extinction-of-nearly-500-species-since-1900.htm) are responsible for over 500 extinctions since the early 1900s.
1.2.3. Pro: De-extinction would involve genetic manipulation, which is inherently unnatural.
1.2.3.1. Con: Unnatural is not inherently negative. There are advances in medicine and technology that are unnatural, yet beneficial.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: [In vitro fertilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation) for example, is not natural yet allows women who cannot conceive naturally a chance to have a child.
1.2.4. Pro: Many species went extinct via [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection), or may have even disappeared long before humans arrived on Earth.
1.2.5. Con: [Naturalistic fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy). Something being natural doesn't imply it's right.
1.3. Pro: Mankind is most directly responsible for the elimination of species; therefore, mankind has a moral responsibility to de-extinct them.
1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.3.3. Con: The act of de-extincting the species could act to remove the guilt felt and as a consequence encourage the continuation of the exploitation that caused the extinction. We could potential act under the pretence that our negative actions no longer matter as we can just bring back the species in the end.
1.3.4. Pro: In the past [500 years](https://www.seeker.com/humans-caused-322-animal-extinctions-in-past-500-years-1768850883.html), humans have been responsible for over 322 extinct species.
1.3.5. Con: In a purely natural world and worldview, moral responsibility does not exist.
1.4. Con: Earth doesn't have the resources to go around.
1.4.1. Pro: Earth has [limited](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethhoffman/2013/08/12/limited-water-resources-might-mean-eating-less-meat/#74b2ce737f1e) water resources. Adding extinct species will deplete this supply at a faster rate.
1.4.1.1. Con: Numbers of animals are currently not limited by water resources, but by human activities. That means that current population are well below what water reserves can sustain.
1.5. Pro: Resurrection can help rebalance ecosystems that have been damaged or have disappeared.
1.5.1. Con: Resurrection could also destabilize ecosystems that have adapted to the absence of extinct species.
1.5.2. Con: Modern ecology has adapted to the extinction of such species. Resurrecting them would have disastrous effects on ecology.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Just like the introduction of foreign species to ecosystems can lead to the extinction of local species, so too can the introduction of a long-extinct species be a threat.
1.5.2.2. Con: The reintroduction process can gradually allow ecosystems to slowly stabilize.
1.5.3. Pro: Introducing flora back to a location after deforestation can invite certain animal species back to the area.
1.6. Pro: Resurrecting the extinct would be good for the economy.
1.6.1. Con: Humans may exploit these species.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Humans may put these animals in captivity for human entertainment.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: We could ride Tyrannosaurs.
1.6.2. Pro: Resurrection of extinct animals would create jobs.
1.6.2.1. Pro: This would generate huge investments in biotech, growing the interest in genetic research which ultimately will benefit human sciences, like curing diseases.
1.7. Pro: De-extincting species would allow scientists to better research them.
1.7.1. Pro: There is a lot of uncertainty in paleontological research. Being able to study living species will help to clear those.
1.7.2. Con: Humans do not need to resurrect species in order to study them. Scientists could do so just by comparing DNA \(assuming more knowledge is gained in genomics\).
1.7.2.1. Con: It is impossible to directly observe an animal's behavior simply by comparing DNA.
1.7.3. Pro: Our current understanding of extinct species is severely limited by their absence.
1.8. Con: We should focus on protecting existing species which are threatened, not on resurrecting those which are already extinct.
1.8.1. Pro: Certain threatened species, if extinct, can [collapse ecosystems](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/if-these-species-go-entire-ecosystems-will-disappear/). Our collective efforts should be in protecting them.
1.9. Con: It is unlikely we could resurrect an extinct species with significant genetic diversity to allow for a healthy population.
1.10. Con: -> See 1.5.2.
1.11. Con: Resurrecting extinct species could have harmful unintended consequences.
1.11.1. Pro: Bringing these species back may also resurrect pathogens and viruses we are not capable of handling.
1.11.2. Pro: Resurrecting a species that no longer has a natural predator could cause it to multiply out of control and ravage species or fauna we need, driving either toward extinction.
1.11.2.1. Pro: We have limited ability to hunt predators in the oceans, so an inedible \(e.g. poisonous\) or largely inedible predator of the major edible fish populations could leave us with little to no edible fish.
1.11.2.2. Pro: Velociraptors could ravage livestock.
1.11.2.3. Pro: A herbivore could devastate crops or destroy the rain forest even faster than we do.
1.11.3. Pro: Some resurrected species could lead to increased generation of greenhouse gases, particularly if we farm them for food.
1.11.3.1. Con: This is only depending on a secondary step. Humans can choose not to farm them, thus eliminating the threat of this.
1.11.3.1.1. Con: It would be next to impossible to achieve consensus on this. If there's a profit in it people will do it, if not in the face of regulation then in areas, potentially entire countries, that the regulation doesn't reach.
1.11.4. Pro: Some extinct species were natural predators. It's plausible that we could become prey, particularly if the predators manage to multiply before we start to effectively hunt them.
1.11.5. Con: We know enough about most extinct species to accurately predict such negative consequences and therefore to avoid them.
1.11.6. Con: Extinct species need not be resurrected for introduction to the general population, which could have these consequences. It might be done on a small scale in order to further research.
1.12. Con: The habitats of most of the extinct species are no longer around to support them.
