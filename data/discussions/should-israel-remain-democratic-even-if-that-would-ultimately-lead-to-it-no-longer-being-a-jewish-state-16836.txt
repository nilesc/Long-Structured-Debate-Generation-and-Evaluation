Discussion Title: Should Israel Remain Democratic Even If that Would Ultimately Lead to it No Longer Being a Jewish State?

1. Israel should choose to be Jewish over being Democratic.
1.1. Con: It is emphasised in the Declaration of Independence that Israel was envisioned to be a democratic state by its founders.
1.1.1. Pro: [The declaration](https://www.knesset.gov.il/docs/eng/megilat_eng.htm) proclaimed that Israel “will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants” and will “ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.”
1.1.2. Pro: Although not an absolute position, as a moral value judgement the value of democracy supercedes the value of national identity.
1.1.3. Con: The interests and intentions of the deceased founders of Israel are less relevant than the immediate concerns of those who currently live in Israel.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Those who founded Israel had no experience of the issues that Israel would come to face, including [multiple wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Israel) as well as consistent [unrest and conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict). These experiences inform the views of Israelis today.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Legal themes such as secularism and democracy can and do work regardless of where they surface. Being surrounded by hostile nations won't reduce Israel's ability to adhere to either of those principles.
1.1.4. Pro: Democracy is easier and immeasurably more stable as a legal default than theocratic or fundamentalist based law which prioritises the needs of one group.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Democracy counts each citizen as a political unit.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Arguably, democratic systems are more stable in the long run \(since tensions between population groups can be resolved\). An unstable system can hardly provide protection for anyone.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: "The results show that highly democratic states are more likely to experience a decreased likelihood that its regimes will be overthrown violently. States with higher levels of democracy are also less prone to ethnic tensions, religious tensions, socio-economic grievances, and military intervention \[...\]"[Tusalem, Rollin F. \(2015\) "Democracies, Autocracies, and Political Stability," International Social Science Review: Vol. 90: Iss. 1, Article 1.](https://digitalcommons.northgeorgia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&context=issr)
1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Democracies are known to value the pluralistic nature of ideas. Democratic systems aim to settle political conflict through meaningful debate and civilized discourse, leading to cultural values of consensus seeking and compromise building, which can offset political instability coming from minority groups in society \(Democracies, Autocracies, and Political Stability, [pg.5](https://digitalcommons.northgeorgia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&context=issr)\).
1.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Democracies are known to provide a pacifying effect on social unrest by allowing citizens to express dissatisfaction with the incumbent regime through the electoral process. They are also known to provide a smooth transition from one elected leader to another without political violence \(Democracies, Autocracies, and Political Stability, [pg.5](https://digitalcommons.northgeorgia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&context=issr)\).
1.1.4.3. Pro: Democracies can avoid the problems of concentration of power with one group/person/body due to frequent elections and separation of powers.
1.1.4.4. Con: Democracies are slower moving on security issues in order to protect individual rights and the rule of law. Maintaining security is the most important objective for preserving stability.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: To protect its citizens from violence, Israel must pursue security measures and government policies which either lack democratic support or contradict democratic values.
1.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Israel has introduced policies which undermine democratic rights, including freedom of association and freedom of speech, in order to prevent organisations and individuals from inciting or organising violence within the state.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: Israel [outlawed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/17/israel-bans-islamist-group-islamic-movement-of-israel) the [Islamic Movement in Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Movement_in_Israel), an organisation which advocates for Muslims in Israel and has stood candidates for election. As the organisation was using its political platform to spread information about Israel's activities which were likely to incite violence, it was worth it to prevent access to this democratic right in order to protect Israeli citizens.
1.1.4.4.1.1.2. Con: Policies which limit the ability of Arab Israelis and Palestinians to organise and communicate their grievances peacefully are likely to push those with legitimate grievances towards increased antagonism and violence. This exposes Israeli citizens to more danger.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3. Con: These policies constitute an unacceptable theft of democratic rights from Arab Israelis and Palestinians, even if they are an effective way of reducing violence.
1.1.4.4.1.2. Pro: Israel has changed the structure of its democratic institutions to make them less open and less representative in order to exclude extremists who would use those institutions to foster hatred and incite violence.
1.1.4.4.1.2.1. Pro: In 2016, the [Knesset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset) voted to introduce a mechanism which allows the parliament to [expel members](https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Let-the-people-expel-MKs-558871) on the [basis](https://www.adalah.org/en/content/view/8866) of either inciting racism or supporting armed struggle against Israel, without any due process, based entirely on the votes of Parliamentarians.
1.1.4.4.2. Pro: Normal democracies need to have broad coalitions in order to advance controversial measures that protect certain groups of people. This can take a long time to build. A Jewish Israel would already have this majority built in.
1.1.4.4.2.1. Con: Israeli Jews have [significant divisions](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/03/no-consensus-among-israeli-jews-about-settlements-impact-on-security/) on major security issues and do not vote as a monolith.
1.1.4.4.3. Con: Many major liberal democracies are able to also have strong state action towards preserving security.
1.1.4.4.3.1. Pro: The United States has the [highest level of military spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures) in the world while being a strong democracy.
1.2. Pro: If the one-state solution is implemented, remaining democratic will make Jews a minority in Israel to the detriment of their welfare.
1.2.1. Pro: Israel can [only be both](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/can-israel-remain-a-democracy/2015/03/20/49d766a8-cf06-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html?utm_term=.4d692bf921e4) Jewish and democratic if it agrees to a two-state solution with Palestine. This is something that Israel is vehemently opposed to. Without a two-state solution, Israel must annex the Palestinian Territories instead. By annexing the Palestinian territories, Israel could remain democratic, but split roughly evenly between Jews and Arabs, and therefore no longer remain Jewish; or Israel annexes the territories, suppresses the rights of Arabs, and ceases to be democratic.
1.2.1.1. Con: It's not Israel as a whole that's opposed to the two-state solution - it's the current government, in the current regional situation. Netanyahu himself has flipped flopped on the issue. And the popularity of the two-state solution has fluctuated wildly, based on short term events. The Israeli body public, in other words, is in two minds about it, and an Arab majority is precisely one of the things that makes the two state solution more attractive.
1.2.1.2. Con: There is no reason why Israel must annex Palestinian territories. The status quo, where a [two-state solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution) is not in place, but Israel remains democratic, is proof of this.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: The current situation is not practical, or likely, long term. Israel faces [international](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/15/world/middleeast/missing-at-israel-palestinian-peace-conference-israelis-or-palestinians.html) [pressure](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/passes-resolution-israeli-settlements-161223192709807.html) to come to a more stable long-term solution.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: UN opposition to Israel has been consistent and ineffectual for the past 50 years. Despite nearly [40%](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-12-26/israelis-don-t-care-how-the-un-votes-here-s-why) of all of the UN's resolutions in the period 2003 and 2012 condemning Israel, neither the Israeli government, its citizens nor its essential allies cared or took any action as a result.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: Additionally, Israel faces [internal pressures](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/03/13/these-are-the-political-parties-battling-for-israels-future/?utm_term=.aacac6238e44) to solve the conflict with Palestine, both from Jewish and \(Palestinian/\) Arab Israelis.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Relationships between Israel's Jews and Arab minority are [worse](https://www.thenational.ae/world/israel-s-jews-and-arab-minority-further-apart-than-ever-poll-says-1.711840) than they have ever been, with each side losing faith in coexistence and becoming less tolerant of the other. Reinforcing Israel as a Jewish state will only lead to a worsening of relations between the two communities, making it harder for Arabs to live in Israel.
1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Israel’s Arabs see their failure to achieve equality with Israel’s Jews as a consequence of the country’s Jewish identity and the failure of its democratic values to compensate for the advantages extended to Jews. Formalising Israel's status as a Jewish state will cement the Arab minority's perception that they will always be inferior \([Rekhess, p. 201](http://www.institutobrasilisrael.org/cms/assets/uploads/_BIBLIOTECA/_PDF/as-minorias-em-israel/37b14f20805634a3087b1c8ee5ff3533.pdf)\).
1.2.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Between 2015-2018, popular opinion polls show a [significant decline](https://www.thenational.ae/world/israel-s-jews-and-arab-minority-further-apart-than-ever-poll-says-1.711840) in the acceptance of Arabs by Jews.
1.2.1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: The percentage of Jewish respondents who recognise the right of Arabs to live in the country as a minority with full citizens' rights [declined](https://www.thenational.ae/world/israel-s-jews-and-arab-minority-further-apart-than-ever-poll-says-1.711840) from 79.7 percent in 2015 to 73.8 percent today.
1.2.1.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: Those [refusing](https://www.thenational.ae/world/israel-s-jews-and-arab-minority-further-apart-than-ever-poll-says-1.711840) to have Arab neighbours rose from 41 percent to 48 percent and the percentage of Jews who decline to enter Arab communities climbed from 59.3 percent to 63.7 percent.
1.2.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Even if making Israel into a Jewish state lead to no legal changes in the position of Arabs, it would at the very least [strengthen the message](https://www.thenational.ae/world/israel-s-jews-and-arab-minority-further-apart-than-ever-poll-says-1.711840) to Arabs that they are second class citizens and that the state belongs to the Jews.
1.2.1.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: In 2012, 70% of Arabs believed that the government treated them as second-class citizens \([Rekhess, p. 192](http://www.institutobrasilisrael.org/cms/assets/uploads/_BIBLIOTECA/_PDF/as-minorias-em-israel/37b14f20805634a3087b1c8ee5ff3533.pdf)\).
1.2.1.2.2.1.3.2. Pro: The Future Vision Documents, a set of documents published by Arab leaders in Israel in 2006-7, called for full equality between Jews and Arabs in every sphere of Israeli society \([Rekhess, p. 190](http://www.institutobrasilisrael.org/cms/assets/uploads/_BIBLIOTECA/_PDF/as-minorias-em-israel/37b14f20805634a3087b1c8ee5ff3533.pdf)\). This indicates a belief that Arabs so far are not equal to Jews; cementing Israel's status as a Jewish state is only going to reinforce this belief.
1.2.1.3. Con: No matter how politically unpopular the two-state solution is amongst Israelis, abandoning the Jewish nature of the state will always be more unpopular.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: In [2016](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/03/08/how-israels-jewishness-is-overtaking-its-democracy/?utm_term=.e1bf5332ec0b), more Israelis agreed with than disagreed with the statement "Arabs should be expelled or transferred from Israel." This is evidence that the Jewish nature of the state is incredibly important to Israelis.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: [Nearly half](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/pf_2016-03-08_israel-01-10/) of Israeli Jews say Arabs should be expelled or transferred from Israel, including roughly one-in-five Jewish adults who strongly agree with this position \([Pew Research Center Survey](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/), 2016\)
1.2.2. Pro: In the event of a one-state solution, a democratic Israel would attempt to integrate Palestinians into Israel. However, since [35%](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinians-becoming-more-extreme-in-their-positions-poll/) of Palestinians support armed resistance against Israel, this attempted integration may end up placing Israeli Jews at risk.
1.2.2.1. Con: Once peace is achieved and Palestinians are able to enjoy equal rights, it seems unlikely that they would still want to engage in violence.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: According to [Nehemia Shtrasler](https://www.haaretz.com/one-state-utopia-it-s-a-surefire-recipe-for-disaster-1.5419573), any artificially-imposed binational state would quickly plunge into violence, as Jews and Palestinian Arabs would identify with their own communities rather than the state, and each community would seek to dominate the other.
1.2.2.2. Pro: [New Historian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Historians) [Benny Morris](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/books/review/Goldberg-t.html?_r=1&ref=books) argues that a single state would be an authoritarian, Islamic fundamentalist state with a persecuted Jewish minority, citing the racism and persecution minorities face throughout the Arab and Muslim world, and in particular, the fact that Jews in Islamic societies were historically treated as second-class citizens and subject to pogroms and discrimination.
1.2.3. Pro: In countries where Jews are a minority, they disproportionately are victims of religiously-motivated violence and hate crimes \(e.g. [France](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/04/is-it-time-for-the-jews-to-leave-europe/386279/)\). Some fear that an Israel without a Jewish majority could see a rise of antisemitism.
1.2.4. Pro: The high total fertility rate among Palestinians accompanied by a return of Palestinian refugees, would quickly render Jews a minority, according to [Sergio DellaPergola](http://fc.retecivica.mi.it/rcmweb/testwebisraele/Israele/Aliyah%20e%20diaspora/Demografia%20e%20sviluppo/S03D0F4A4.0/Demography%20in%20IsraelPalesti.pdf), an Israeli demographer and statistician.
1.2.5. Pro: A [poll](https://web.archive.org/web/20110727165917/http://www.pcrd-pal.org/opinion_polls.php?pid=5) found that, in a unified "democratic" state, 23% of Palestinians want civil law only, 35% want both Islamic and civil law, and 38% want Islamic law only. A unified "democratic" country would clearly be detrimental to the Jewish minority.
1.2.6. Con: In anticipation to a shift towards a single state, by instituting policies to protect minorities and keep religion out of politics, the potential Islamization could be mitigated. By looking critically upon other systems in the world and analyzing how to protect citizens from both religions, minority status wouldn't be the end of Jewish representation. While not always 100% effective, they can help mitigate discrimination and [justify legal action](https://www.aclu.org/other/discrimination-against-muslim-women-fact-sheet) against them \(no ACLU without rights to defend\).
1.3. Con: Israel can be both Jewish and democratic at the same time.
1.3.1. Pro: According to the Israeli Democracy Index 2013, a sizeable majority of Jews \(74.8%\) believe that the State of Israel can be both Jewish and democratic \([pg.8](https://en.idi.org.il/media/5112/2013-democracy-index-main-findings.pdf)\).
1.3.1.1. Con: The percentage of Jewish respondents who prefer the combined definition “Jewish and democratic” has declined steadily in recent years, reaching 37% in 2013 \([pg.8](https://en.idi.org.il/media/5112/2013-democracy-index-main-findings.pdf)\).
1.3.1.2. Con: Only a third of Arab respondents share the view that the State of Israel can be both Jewish and democratic \([pg.8](https://en.idi.org.il/media/5112/2013-democracy-index-main-findings.pdf)\).
1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.3.3. Con: A 2014-2015 survey by [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/pf_2016-03-08_israel-01-03/) shows that Israeli Arabs generally do not think Israel can be a Jewish state and a democracy at the same time. This view is expressed by majorities of Muslims \(63%\), Christians \(72%\) and Druze \(58%\). Overwhelmingly, all three of these groups say that if there is a conflict between Jewish law and democracy, democracy should take precedence.
1.3.4. Pro: Israel has no official state religion and maintains a system of [religious courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_of_Israel) for the Jewish, Muslim, Druze, and Christian populations. These courts have jurisdiction over cases such as marital issues, conversion, and appointment to religious leadership positions.
1.3.5. Con: Israel should become democratic and stop their racist politics against Arab population. That's impossible to achieve while becoming a religious or ethnical state, those kind of states are non-democratic by definition.
1.3.6. Pro: Religious and Haredi Jews have the two highest [fertility rates](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/israel-confronts-its-changing-demographics) of any demographic grouping within Israel. As a result, the Jewish demographic makeup of the country is unlikely to be challenged despite relatively high fertility rates among Arab Christians and Arab Muslims.
1.3.6.1. Pro: The religious conservatism of [Haredi Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haredi_Judaism), the group with the highest [fertility rate](https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Haredi-population-tops-one-million-521515) of any group in Israel, indicates that the Jewish identity of Israel is likely to be strengthened, not weakened as the state moves forward.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: The religiously conservative groups are also more likely to be undemocratic in some ways. Thus, the increase in Jewish proportion of the population and strengthening of the Jewish identity may come hand in hand with the erosion of democracy.
1.3.6.2. Con: Fertility rates alone do not account for the likely return of many [Palestinian refugees](http://fc.retecivica.mi.it/rcmweb/testwebisraele/Israele/Aliyah%20e%20diaspora/Demografia%20e%20sviluppo/S03D0F4A4.0/Demography%20in%20IsraelPalesti.pdf) in a scenario in which the Israeli state fully embraced democratic principles.
1.3.6.3. Con: Other sources point out that, depending on whether a two-state solution is implemented, the proportion of Palestinians may range from [20% of eligible voters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/03/13/these-are-the-political-parties-battling-for-israels-future/?utm_term=.2b7da7b6cd50) in Israel itself, to predictions that Palestinians will [outnumber](https://www.haaretz.com/pa-palestinians-to-outnumber-jews-by-2020-1.5285402) Jews by \(as early as\) 2020 in a combined Israel-Palestine.
1.3.6.3.1. Con: 20% of voters are not enough to compromise the integrity of Israel as a Jewish state and have not done so.
1.3.6.3.1.1. Con: 20% of voters is a significant voting bloc that can make or break coalitions for a government. This will give Palestinians significant influence over the policies of Israel.
1.3.6.3.2. Pro: A major factor in determining exact demographic predictions is whether there will be a solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, what this solution will look like and how it will impact demographics.
1.3.6.3.2.1. Pro: For example, if there was a stable one-state solution, Palestinian emigrants/ refugees \(and their descendants\) may wish to return. This population along with those currently living in Gaza and the West Bank would add to the current 'Arab Israeli' demographic. These possible demographic changes need to be considered in order to create accurate demographic predictions.
1.3.7. Pro: It is possible for a state to maintain an emphasis on certain cultural and religious values even as it maintains an equality of democratic civil rights for all. Israel is no exception.
1.3.7.1. Pro: It is the duty of every democracy to reflect the basic preferences of the majority, as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others. In Israel’s case, this means preserving the Jewish character of the state.
1.3.7.1.1. Pro: The majority of the Israeli population are Jews \([74.5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Israel)\). The Israeli state has an obligation to them to keep the state Jewish.
1.3.7.1.1.1. Con: There are many Jews who are secular and believe that Jerusalem should be a city for all people: religious, non-religious and those belonging to different religions.
1.3.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: The call for an "open" Jerusalem has [received support](https://web.archive.org/web/20090912054710/http://www.hartman.org.il:80/Opinion_C_View_Eng.asp?Article_Id=365) from Rabbi Dr. Donniel Hartman, an Orthodox Rabbi and President of the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem. He wrote: "As a religious Jew who is also a Zionist I believe Jerusalem is not simply important as the city of God, but as the capital of the State of Israel.… The meaning of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is that it is a city which belongs to all citizens of the State of Israel.”
1.3.7.1.1.1.2. Pro: [44 percent](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/latest-population-statistics-for-israel) of Jews in Israel self-identify as secular, 11 percent self-identify as religious, and only 9 percent self-identify as ultra-Orthodox.
1.3.7.1.2. Con: The duty of reflecting preferences cannot infringe the rights of others. A Jewish \(or Muslim, or Christian\) state, by definition, infringes the rights of the rest of the population as long as it puts one religion \(or the lack of it\) above others. A state cannot link its laws to human rights and to religious dogmas at the same time.
1.3.7.2. Pro: The [Croatian constitution](http://www.constitution.org/cons/croatia.htm) emphasises the importance of Croatian national and ethnic identity while also acknowledging the place of other ethnicities within the state. It proclaims “the national state of the Croatian people and a state of members of other nations and minorities who are its citizens: Serbs, Muslims, Slovenes, Czechs, Slovaks, Italians, Hungarians, Jews and others, who are guaranteed equality with citizens of Croatian nationality.”
1.3.7.3. Pro: Both the [Irish](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en) and [Greek](http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/) constitutions, which are democratic, begin with explicit references to the [Holy Trinity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity)
1.3.7.4. Con: There is a difference between placing emphasis on particular parts of national identity, and explicitly being defined by one part of that identity. The latter, necessarily, includes preferential treatment for those who subscribe to that identity; after all, there is no point in having a Jewish state if Jews receive no further benefit from it.
1.3.7.4.1. Pro: Jewish religious symbols define and dominate Israel.
1.3.7.4.1.1. Pro: The Israeli National Anthem, [Hatikvah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatikvah#Objections_by_non-Jewish_Israelis), is exclusively Jewish as it refers to Jews by name and alludes to the concept of Zionism. The anthem contains no mention of Palestinian Arab culture and therefore excludes non-Jews from its narrative of national identity.
1.3.7.4.1.2. Pro: The blue stripes of the [Israeli flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel#Origin_of_the_flag) are intended to symbolize the stripes on a [tallit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallit), the traditional Jewish prayer shawl.
1.3.7.4.1.3. Pro: The portrayal of a [Star of David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_David) on the flag of the State of Israel is a widely acknowledged symbol of Judaism.
1.3.7.4.1.4. Pro: Israel's [official holidays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Israel) are exclusively [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_holidays#Israeli/Jewish_national_holidays_and_days_of_remembrance).
1.3.7.4.2. Pro: According to the [Law of Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Return), Jews around the world have the right to come and live in Israel and to gain Israeli citizenship. No such right is accorded to Palestinian minorities.
1.3.7.4.2.1. Pro: Those who gain Israeli citizenship through this law receive many [government benefits](http://www.jewishagency.org/aliyah-benefits/program/8231) such as housing and health insurance.
1.3.7.4.2.2. Pro: Palestinian Israeli citizens, however, are subject to a ban on family reunification: if they marry a fellow Palestinian from the West Bank or Gaza, they are prohibited from living in Israel under the [Citizenship and Entry Into Israel Law](http://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/citizenship_law.htm).
1.3.7.4.2.3. Pro: The law rejects the Palestinian right of return and refuses to allow the Palestinian citizens of Israel to unite with their immediate families or with those who were expelled in 1948 despite the right being recognized internationally by the UN [General Assembly Resolution 194](https://jewishvoiceforpeace.org/un-general-assembly-resolution-194/) of 1948.
1.3.7.4.2.4. Con: The Law of Return is no different from the [immigration laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_return) of Armenia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Hungary, Poland and Portugal, which likewise grant a right of return based on ethnic origin.
1.3.7.4.2.4.1. Con: If someone has converted to Judaism without having Jewish ancestry, they can still exercise the [right to return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Return), making Israeli immigration laws unique in that the selection happens on religious basis, and not ethnic.
1.3.7.4.3. Con: Preferential treatment for one group does not necessarily damage the prospects of another. For instance, Israel's funding of the [Israel Antiquities Authority](http://www.antiquities.org.il/default_en.aspx) benefits people who care about Jewish culture, while those who do not face no particular harm.
1.3.7.4.4. Pro: 79 percent of all Jews in Israel, including 69 percent of Hilonim \(secular Jews\), say that Jews [deserve](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/03/08/how-israels-jewishness-is-overtaking-its-democracy/?utm_term=.626610f34e7a) “preferential treatment” in Israel. A Jewish state is more than just mere 'emphasis' on Jewishness.
1.4. Con: Israel must remain democratic to protect its minorities, especially the Arab Israeli minority.
1.4.1. Pro: Many existing laws are already discriminatory towards the non-Jewish citizens of Israel. Such legislation is only going to increase if Israel formally becomes a Jewish state.
1.4.1.1. Pro: The Jewish nature of the state is explicitly anchored in Amendment 9 to Basic Law: the Knesset \(1985\), which states that "A candidates' list shall not participate in elections to the Knesset if its objects or actions, expressly or by implication, include one of the following: \(1\) negation of the existence of the State of Israel as the state of the Jewish people..." \([pg.11](https://publicofficialsfinancialdisclosure.worldbank.org/sites/fdl/files/assets/law-library-files/Israel_Basic%20Law%20The%20Knesset_1958_EN.pdf)\).
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The Central Elections Committee initially banned the political party, [Progressive List For Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_List_for_Peace#Attempted_banning), from running for the 1988 elections, arguing that its policies promoted the scrapping of Israel as a Jewish state. Attempts were also made to ban the Israeli Arab parties Balad and Ta'al using the same law prior to the [2009 elections](https://en.idi.org.il/articles/11889).
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: The Fifteenth Knesset again amended the "Basic Law: The Knesset", in order to enforce the limit not only upon a party of candidates list but also upon each individual, separately \([Article 7A](http://knesset.gov.il/constitution/ConstP2_eng.htm)\).
1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: During the [Elections for the 16th Knesset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_and_democratic_state#Israeli_High_Court_of_Justice's_commentary), the Israeli Central Elections Committee [disqualified](https://www.haaretz.com/1.4972014) the candidacy of Azmi Bishara and of Ahmad Tibi based upon this law.
1.4.1.2. Pro: There are currently [over 65 Israeli laws](https://www.adalah.org/en/content/view/7771) that discriminate directly or indirectly against Palestinian citizens in Israel and/or Palestinian residents of the Occupied Palestinian Territory \(OPT\). The discrimination in these laws is either explicit or, more often, the laws are worded in a seemingly neutral manner, but have a disparate impact on Palestinians in their implementation. These laws limit the rights of Palestinians in all areas of life.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: The Israeli High Court has [upheld](https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-court-allows-villages-to-veto-residents-1.5302588) the Admissions Committees Law, which allows communities to reject housing applicants who “aren’t suitable to the community’s social life” - a legal pretext to deny residency to non-Jews.
1.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: This law allows small communities built on state lands to condition membership to that community on the approval of a screening committee. Under the law, the committee may reject candidates deemed unsuitable to the “social life” or the “sociocultural fabric” of the community, an easy excuse to [discriminate](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/court-sanctioned-discrimination-committees-1.5303289) against all sorts of minorities.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.4.2.
1.4.1.2.3. Pro: The [Arab minority](https://www.thenational.ae/world/israel-s-jews-and-arab-minority-further-apart-than-ever-poll-says-1.711840) has the right to vote and has representatives in parliament but has traditionally faced discrimination in employment and government budgets. The demolition of Arab homes built without permits - which are difficult or often impossible to obtain - also breeds bitterness.
1.4.2. Con: There is an [obligation in Judaism](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/minority-rights-behar-bechukotai-5777/) to support and sustain resident aliens \(people who are not Jewish but continue to remain in Israeli lands\). They have a right to live in this land and have a right to share in welfare provisions. Therefore, a Jewish Israeli state need not necessarily and should not discriminate against minority religious groups.
1.4.2.1. Pro: "If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and are unable to support themselves among you, help them as you would a foreigner and stranger, so they can continue to live among you." \([Leviticus 25:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+25%3A35&version=NIV)\)
1.4.2.2. Pro: "For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes. He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the stranger residing among you, giving them food and clothing. You are to love those who are strangers, for you yourselves were strangers in Egypt." \([Deut 10:17-19](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/minority-rights-behar-bechukotai-5777/)\)
1.4.2.3. Pro: "Do not oppress a stranger; you yourselves know how it feels to be strangers, because you were strangers in Egypt." \([Ex. 23:9](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/minority-rights-behar-bechukotai-5777/)\)
1.4.2.4. Pro: According to the [Rambam](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/minority-rights-behar-bechukotai-5777/) there is an obligation on Jews in Israel to establish courts of law for resident aliens to allow them to settle their own disputes – or disputes they have with Jews — according to the provisions of Noahide law.
1.4.3. Pro: A bill seeking to formalise Israel's status as a Jewish state would become a Basic Law, which means its principles would guide the rest of Israel’s legal system. This would make it [easier](http://www.jewishomaha.org/jewish-press/2014/11/making-israels-jewish-status-the-law-does-it-matter/) for discriminatory laws to pass Knesset and stand up in court, hurting minorities even more.
1.4.3.1. Pro: The "[nation state](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-44881554)" law passed by the Israeli Parliament says Jews have a unique right to national self-determination in Israel and puts Hebrew above Arabic as the official language.
1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.1.
1.5. Pro: The state of Israel was created for Jews, and it is only right that the state remain Jewish.
1.5.1. Pro: The Law of Return makes Israel [important for Jews globally](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/can-israel-remain-a-democracy/2015/03/20/49d766a8-cf06-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html?utm_term=.4d692bf921e4), because it can ease anxiety about a future rise of anti-semitism threatening Jewish existence outside a Jewish state.
1.5.1.1. Con: A Jewish state is not the only possible safe home for Jews. A liberal democracy should safeguard the rights of all its citizens, independent of ethnicity. A non-Jewish majority state could also be a safe home, provided the constitution gives strong protection of minorities.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Nearly [98%](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/pf_2016-03-08_israel-01-05/) of Israeli Jews strongly agree that Jews around the world should have the right to make [aliyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah). Fully three-quarters of Israeli Jews \([76%](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/)\) think that anti-semitism is both common and increasing around the world, and roughly nine-in-ten \([91%](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/pf_2016-03-08_israel-01-06/)\) say that a Jewish state is necessary for the long-term survival of the Jewish people.
1.5.1.3. Con: Israel can reasonably continue to protect persons from xenophobic persecution through mechanisms such as granting asylum without necessarily becoming a Jewish state.
1.5.1.3.1. Con: While Israel would still be able to grant individuals asylum, it would also be politically more difficult to prioritize Jewish asylum seekers over others if Israel was a democratic state and not a Jewish state.
1.5.1.4. Pro: These fears may be [well founded](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/04/is-it-time-for-the-jews-to-leave-europe/386279/), with the current rise of [anti-semitism](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/07/antisemitism-rise-europe-worst-since-nazis) and [far-right](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/world/europe/europe-far-right-political-parties-listy.html) politics in Europe.
1.5.1.4.1. Pro: 7% of Jews in a group of major European states have experienced physical attack for being Jewish in the past five years \(2013 numbers\).[Technical report: FRA survey - Discrimination and hate crime against Jews in EU Member States: experiences and perceptions of antisemitism](http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2013/discrimination-and-hate-crime-against-jews-eu-member-states-experiences-and)
1.5.1.4.2. Pro: In Hungary, a party with openly anti-Semitic roots - [Jobbik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobbik) - secured almost 20% of popular vote in the 2018 parliamentary elections.
1.5.2. Pro: The [Balfour Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration), the first political recognition of Zionist aims by a major international power, makes explicit reference to ["a national home for the Jewish people".](http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/peace/guide/pages/the%20balfour%20declaration.aspx)
1.5.2.1. Con: The [Balfour declaration](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/01/the-balfour-declaration-review-conflict-and-coexistence-in-israels-promised-land) also includes this clause, "it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine." This could reasonably be interpreted to suggest that Israel should not become a Jewish state, given how minorities might be affected by such a decision.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.
1.5.3. Pro: Israel was created after the horrors of the Holocaust as a place of refuge for the Jewish people. That is more important than the kind of political system they have.
1.5.3.1. Pro: The presence of a Jewish state is important for the future protection of Jewish people who may face persecution elsewhere in the world. A Jewish state guarantees that those people will always have a refuge. There is no such guarantee if Israel surrenders that identity.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: While many of the world's other main religions, \(like [Islam](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion#Islamic_countries), [Christianity](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion#Christian_countries) and [Buddhism](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion#Buddhism_as_state_religion)\) are accepted by several countries as their state religion; no other country has Judaism as its state religion.
1.5.3.1.1.1. Con: There are [hundreds, if not thousands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religions_and_spiritual_traditions) of currently-practiced religions, most of which are not designated state religions of any country. It's not clear why having a country is necessary or desirable for a religion.
1.5.3.1.1.2. Pro: With just over 6.5 million Jews, [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_population_by_country) is the only Jewish majority and explicitly Jewish state.
1.5.3.2. Con: The Holocaust did not create the state of Israel. The Zionist movement and the establishment of the modern state were underway long before it happened.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: In 1917, the [Balfour Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration) marked the British government's endorsement of the creation of the state of Israel.
1.5.3.2.2. Pro: The roadmap for a Jewish state in the area that later became Israel was established in August 1897, during the [First Zionist Congress](http://blogs.cbn.com/jerusalemdateline/archive/2011/09/09/the-declaration-of-basel.aspx?mobile=false) convened in Basel, Switzerland.
1.5.3.2.2.1. Pro: Theodore Herzl, who presided over the meeting, famously [wrote in his diary](https://www.arza.org/blog/post/modernity-created-israel): "At Basel I founded the Jewish State. If I said this out loud today l would be greeted by universal laughter. In five years perhaps, and certainly in fifty years, everyone will perceive it."
1.5.3.2.3. Con: Even though the Holocaust may have happened after the initial movement for the Jewish state, it proved the necessity of the Jewish state as a sanctuary for the Jewish people.
1.5.3.2.4. Pro: The right of the Jewish state to be re-constituted was incorporated into international law at the [San Remo Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Remo_conference) in 1920, following World War I, and remains in effect to this day. The mandate affirmed the Jews’ right to settle anywhere between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. [This right](http://blog.camera.org/archives/2011/08/israel_and_jerusalem_in_intern_1.html) has never been superseded by any other legal document.
1.5.4. Con: The [land](http://www.cjpme.org/fs_007) which the state of Israel claims has been occupied by people who are not Jewish in significant numbers for centuries. These people, mostly Arab Muslims and Christians, have at least as much of a claim to participate in any state that is set up in that land.
1.5.4.1. Con: Arab Muslim and Christian states exist in abundance around the world and in the region. The population of nearby Jordan is [70% ethnically Palestinian](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/weekinreview/world-jordan-has-its-own-palestinian-problem-mideast-kingdom-threatened-peace.html). The Jewish state exists to provide a home not only to Jews in European diaspora, but also to Jewish populations in the Arab world that had been expelled in 1948 or after the Second World War.
1.5.5. Con: A country must protect the rights of all its citizens. Citizens are not able to simply pick up and leave. Since they have no choice on where to live, it is unacceptable to arbitrarily exclude a part of the population and claim the state is "not for them".
1.5.6. Con: The actions required to protect a 'Jewish' Israel would compromise Israel's 'Jewishness', because those actions would be inconsistent with Judaism.
1.5.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.
1.5.7. Con: None of the 11 Basic Laws of Israel, the closest thing the country has to a constitution, [define](http://www.jewishomaha.org/jewish-press/2014/11/making-israels-jewish-status-the-law-does-it-matter/) Israel as a Jewish state. Despite the mention of Judaism throughout Israel's laws, there is [no constitutional basis](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/making-the-jewish-state-a-jewish-state/) for claiming that Israel is a Jewish state.
1.5.7.1. Con: A lack of constitutional support for recognising Israel as a Jewish state does not undermine the historical understanding and contemporary perception of Israel as a Jewish state.
1.5.8. Pro: The state of Israel established a Jewish majority after the exclusion of the indigenous Palestinian population.
1.5.8.1. Con: When the State of Israel was established, around 80 percent of the Arab inhabitants of what became Israel [were expelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_exodus) forcefully from their homes. Their exclusion from the country is what created the so-called Jewish majority that Israel says is its right to maintain and is undemocratic in nature.
1.6. Con: Forsaking its status as the only true democracy in the Middle East will alienate Israel from its allies.
1.6.1. Con: Israel's allies, most importantly the United States, have a [long history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi) of supporting [anti-democratic](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/saudi-arabia-protests-execution-uk-police-training-saudi-forces-torture-theresa-may-a7878361.html) [governments](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2017/qatar) in the Middle East.
1.6.2. Pro: Along with the US, two of Israel's other primary allies, [Australia and Canada](https://www.cfr.org/blog/israels-three-un-allies), align with Israel because of its image as a democratic country.
1.6.3. Pro: Israel may not be able to pursue better relations with Arab states like [Saudi Arabia](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-43632905) and [Egypt](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/11/egypt-israel-relations-highest-level-history-161107083926863.html) if it ceases to remain a proper democracy.
1.6.3.1. Pro: It would become politically impossible for Muslim majority Arab states to support Israel or try to improve relations with Israel in any meaningful way if Israel becomes an explicitly Jewish state.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: Moves towards a Jewish state will garner protests from Muslim and Arab communities \(among others\) within Israel. These groups will put pressure on majority Muslim and Arab states to further condemn Israel. This has [already happened](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/israel-s-nation-state-law-unites-arab-world-in-condemnation-1.3573981) with the new nation state law.
1.6.4. Con: Since the US remains allies with Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy, there is no reason to think that a non-democratic Israel will alienate its allies.
1.6.5. Pro: The creation of a Jewish state would increase the gap between Israel and the already distancing young American Jews. This is problematic because these two countries collectively have the [largest global population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_population_by_country) of Jews and the future of world Jewry will likely be shaped by the relationship between them.
1.6.5.1. Pro: According to [a recent report](https://www.timesofisrael.com/crisis-with-world-jewry-could-cost-israel-billions-deputy-minister-warns/) issued by the Diaspora Affairs Ministry, American Jews give NIS 8 billion in cash to Israel every year - that is 90 percent of all donations to the state. Together with the contributions made through investments and venture capital, real estate holdings, exports and tourism, the amount US Jews put into the Israeli economy reaches nearly NIS 58 billion \(about $14 billion\).
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: A one percent drop-off in the Diaspora’s contribution to the Israeli economy [could result](https://www.timesofisrael.com/crisis-with-world-jewry-could-cost-israel-billions-deputy-minister-warns/) in the loss of 1,800 Israeli jobs.
1.6.5.2. Pro: Many North American Jews were angered after Prime Minister Netanyahu [reneged on an agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/world/middleeast/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-ultra-orthodox-western-wall.html) to improve pluralistic prayer arrangements at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, once a hallowed symbol of Jewish unity, and promoted a bill enshrining the Orthodox Chief Rabbinate’s monopoly over conversions to Judaism in Israel.
1.6.5.3. Pro: A solid majority of Israeli Jews \([69%](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/views-of-the-jewish-state-and-the-diaspora/pf_2016-03-08_israel-09-10/)\) believe that a strong Jewish diaspora is vital to the long-term survival of Jews.
1.6.5.4. Pro: [Most young American Jews](https://theconversation.com/as-israel-turns-70-many-young-american-jews-turn-away-95271) have been raised with two complementary belief systems: political liberalism that emphasizes equality and opposes all forms of discrimination, and a non-Orthodox Americanized Judaism that emphasizes universalism and a commitment to social justice. Many find it hard to reconcile these internalized values with the idea of a state that gives preferential treatment to Jews at the expense of its non-Jewish citizens.
1.6.5.4.1. Pro: This also distances young American Jews from the Orthodox portion of Israeli population.
1.6.5.5. Pro: In [a recent survey](http://www.acjna.org/acjna/articles_detail.aspx?id=2694) of Jews living in San Francisco’s Bay Area, just 45 percent of those between the ages of 18 to 34 said they were comfortable with the idea of a Jewish state, and just over a third thought that a Jewish state was very important.
1.6.5.6. Pro: Young American Jews are growing more estranged from the Jewish state. [Pew data](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey/) from 2013 found that only 38% of Jews say that the Israeli government is making a sincere effort to establish peace with the Palestinians.
1.6.5.7. Con: Young American Jews are a relatively unimportant element of the [Israel lobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_lobby_in_the_United_States) in the United States. This is evidenced by AIPAC's [continued success](https://www.aipac.org/about/what-weve-accomplished) despite the trends noted.
1.6.5.7.1. Pro: In 2017, the Israel lobby secured one of its most important goals when President Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's [capital.](https://qz.com/1148673/trumps-jerusalem-move-is-backed-by-billionaires-lobbyists-and-evangelicals/)
1.6.5.8. Pro: Clashes with American Jews will [threaten the unity](https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/A-sad-decision-that-may-yet-come-to-haunt-us-all-497930) of the Jewish people and pose a long-term threat to one of the foundational pillars of Israeli national security: the willingness and ability of American Jewish organizations to stand by Israel at her hours of need. The special relationship with the USA is central to Israel’s prospects of surviving and prospering in a dangerous and hostile region.
1.6.5.8.1. Pro: A reducing support for Israel among American Jewish politicians could also jeopardize Israel's national security. [Currently](https://www.timesofisrael.com/almost-6-of-congress-now-jewish-28-democrats-and-2-republicans/), 5.6 percent of the US Congress is Jewish \(30 lawmakers\).
1.6.6. Con: The largest pro-Israel lobbying organisation in the US is [CUFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians_United_for_Israel) \(Christians United for Israel\). Christian evangelical support for Israel has very little to do with Israel's status as a democracy. As a result, it is unlikely that the US position on Israel would change even if it began to act in undemocratic ways.
1.6.6.1. Pro: Evangelical Christians see Israel's continued existence as vital for the protection of [Christian minorities](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/01/07/christians-united-for-israel-hits-2-million/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.c9657ac64223) in the Middle East. This has little to do with whether or not it is democratic, and if Israel became a state dominated by Arab Muslims, it is likely that such support would dwindle.
1.6.6.2. Pro: A significant proportion of Evangelical Christian support for Israel is based on the belief that the existence of a fully Jewish state in the Holy Land is a requirement for the coming of the [Armageddon](https://youtu.be/Fo77sTGpngQ).
1.7. Pro: Israel must choose to reject democracy in order to protect its Jewish population.
1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.
1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.1.
1.7.3. Pro: The creation of a Basic Law proclaiming Israel a Jewish state would [prevent](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/making-the-jewish-state-a-jewish-state/) courts from making decisions that erode Israel’s Jewish nature in the name of preserving its democratic one.
1.7.3.1. Pro: A series of High Court rulings have stated that Jewish organisations such as the Zionist Federation, the JNF, and the Jewish Agency can no longer restrict sale of the land they own to Jews, but must also sell to Arabs. Many in the country [perceived](http://azure.org.il/include/print.php?id=492) this as an attack on the right of Jews to settle in their historical homeland.
1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.
1.7.6. Con: The Israeli population includes people other than Jews. [20.9 percent](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/latest-population-statistics-for-israel) of the population in Israel is Arab and people identified as "others" \(non-Arab Christians, Baha'i, etc\) make up 4.6 percent of the population. It is important to protect all of them too.
1.8. Con: Israel choosing to be Jewish would destroy the Palestinian peace process.
1.8.1. Pro: Choosing to be Jewish would alienate Arab Israelis, a key group in the Palestinian peace process.
1.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.1.
1.8.1.2. Pro: The peace process should not be over until Israel can reach mutually acceptable agreements over the [treatment of Palestinians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel#Contesting_allegations_of_discrimination) who now live within the borders of Israel. This group would be worse off if Israel rejected democracy.
1.8.2. Con: How Israel forms its own political system should not affect the Palestinian peace process since they are separate entities.
1.8.2.1. Pro: The Palestinian [Declaration of Independence of 1988](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/6EB54A389E2DA6C6852560DE0070E392) plainly declares that the Palestinian state would be an Arab state. That did not impede negotiations for peace between Israel and the Palestinians as the [Oslo Accords](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1993-2000/oslo) were signed 5 years later.
1.8.3. Pro: Israel choosing to be a Jewish state confirms the narratives of an antidemocratic state that many Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza use to fuel anger against Israel.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Leaders of both Fatah and Hamas have [condemned](https://www.timesofisrael.com/abbas-urges-world-to-halt-racist-nation-state-law/) Israel's new nation state law.
1.8.4. Con: The Palestinian peace process is already dead, regardless of whether Israel chooses to be democratic or Jewish.
1.8.4.1. Pro: Representatives of the Palestinian Authority have already [proclaimed](https://www.jpost.com/Blogs/Frank-Times/Palestinians-Call-Moribund-Peace-Process-Dead-517530) the Peace Process dead.
1.8.4.2. Con: Despite a drop in support, a [majority](https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Public-opinion-poll-No-Palestinian-state-in-five-years-501329) of both Palestinians and Israelis continue to support a two-state solution.
1.8.4.3. Pro: The US has played a [pivotal](https://www.mepc.org/united-states-and-breakdown-israeli-palestinian-peace-process), if difficult, role as a broker in the peace process. After Trump recognised [Jerusalem](https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Its-past-time-to-bury-the-Israeli-Palestinian-peace-process-558434) as the capital of Israel; a key sticking point in negotiations, Palestinians can no longer count on the US as an honest broker.
1.8.4.4. Pro: Prominent Palestinians already view Israel as a non-democratic ["Apartheid"](https://www.timesofisrael.com/abbas-tells-un-its-responsible-for-ending-israeli-apartheid/) state.
1.8.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.1.3.1.
1.9. Pro: Israel must remain a Jewish state in order to preserve Jewish culture.
1.9.1. Pro: Becoming a Jewish state protects Jewish culture within Israel.
1.9.1.1. Pro: [Laws](https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Knesset-passes-contentious-Shabbat-law-by-one-vote-after-all-nighter-533209) protecting [Shabbat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat), an essential Jewish cultural and religious practice, are unlikely to be maintained in an Israel that chooses to be democratic rather than Jewish.
1.9.1.2. Con: Among different ethnicities of Jewish people in Israel, there are [significant](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/jewish-beliefs-and-practices/) differences between cultural and religious practices. There is therefore no single Jewish culture which can be effectively protected and preserved by the state.
1.9.1.2.1. Pro: The [public intermingling](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/pf_2016-03-08_israel-01-09/) of men and women is a point of disagreement among Israeli Jews. A solid majority of Haredim Jews \(62%\) favor gender segregation on public transportation, such as buses and trains, used by members of the Haredi community. Among Hilonim Jews, meanwhile, just 5% favor this policy. The vast majority of Hilonim Jews \(93%\) are opposed to enforcing gender segregation on any public transport, even when it is used by Haredim Jews \([Pew Research Center](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/)\).
1.9.1.2.2. Pro: Israel does not allow civil marriage, and Jewish marriages conducted in Israel must be sanctioned by Orthodox rabbis. Haredim Jews [strongly oppose](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/pf_2016-03-08_israel-01-09/) allowing non-Orthodox rabbis to conduct marriages in Israel, while a majority of Hilonim Jews favor changing the current law to allow Reform and Conservative rabbis to conduct weddings \([Pew Research Center](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/)\).
1.9.1.2.3. Pro: [A majority](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/) of Haredi \(81%\) and Dati \(66%\) Jews oppose allowing women to pray at the Kotel \([Western Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Wall)\). 44% of Masorti and 55% of Hiloni Jews, however, support allowing women to pray at the Kotel.
1.9.2. Pro: Jewish culture in Israel is essential for preserving Jewish culture globally.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Jerusalem holds a deep religious significance for Jews around the world. The history, faith, religion, culture and identity of the Jewish people have always been tied to Israel so it is important that it remains under Jewish influence.
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: [In Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_in_Judaism#In_prayer), the daily prayers contain numerous references to Jerusalem.
1.9.2.1.1.1. Pro: The amidah prayer, which is recited three times on regular weekdays, must be said [facing towards Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amidah#Facing_Jerusalem).
1.9.2.1.1.2. Pro: [The Grace After Meals](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/135366/jewish/Birkat-Hamazon-in-English.htm), which is recited after partaking of a meal eaten with bread, and the thanksgiving blessing [contain references to Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_in_Judaism#In_prayer).
1.9.2.1.2. Pro: Many Jewish groups observe [several customs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_in_Judaism#Customs_in_remembrance_of_Jerusalem) in remembrance of Jerusalem.
1.9.2.1.2.1. Pro: [A tiny amount of ash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_in_Judaism#Customs_in_remembrance_of_Jerusalem) is touched to the forehead of a Jewish groom before he goes to stand beneath the bridal canopy which symbolically reminds him not to allow his own rejoicing to be "greater" than the ongoing need to recall Jerusalem's destruction.
1.9.2.1.2.2. Pro: One explanation for the well-known custom of the groom [breaking a glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_wedding#Breaking_the_glass) with the heel of his shoe after the wedding ceremony is that it is related to the subject of mourning for Jerusalem. It is a custom for some that the groom recites the sentence from Psalms, "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget \[her cunning\]." \(Psalms 137:5\).
1.9.2.1.3. Con: With or without a Jewish state, it is likely the long standing [status quo of the Holy Land sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_of_Holy_Land_sites#Impact) will continue. This allows for Jewish control over designated Jewish holy sites in Jerusalem, while Christians, Jews, and Muslims have to all agree on issues relating to the common holy sites of Jerusalem.
1.9.2.1.3.1. Pro: Even the right wing Israeli Prime Minister has [confirmed that Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-no-change-in-temple-mount-status-quo/) has no plans to change the status quo.
1.9.2.1.3.2. Pro: Israel has a tremendous amount of pressure from the millions of followers of Christianity and Islam abroad to respect this status quo.
1.9.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: The Vatican has strongly advocated for [maintenance](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-israel-pope/respect-status-quo-of-jerusalem-says-pope-in-response-to-trump-move-idUSKBN1E00VE) of the "status quo".
1.9.2.1.4. Con: Jews from across the world don’t have a single homogeneous identity.
1.9.2.1.4.1. Pro: With the birth of the state of Israel in 1948, in addition to existing dimensions of identity, a new and unique one [emerged](http://www.spiegel.de/international/religion-and-secularism-in-israel-unholy-conflict-in-the-holy-land-a-469996.html), defining itself particularly through the Hebrew language, Israeli culture, strong national sentiment, the experience of the Holocaust and the need to band together against conflict with hostile neighbors in the Middle East.
1.9.2.1.4.2. Pro: Jewish identity can have cultural, ethnic, religious, political, genealogical, and personal [dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_is_a_Jew%3F).
1.9.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: [Ethnic Jew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_is_a_Jew%3F#Ethnic_definitions) is a term generally used to describe a person of Jewish parentage and background who does not necessarily actively practice Judaism, but still identifies with Judaism or other Jews culturally or fraternally, or both. A number of [distinctive communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ethnic_divisions#Geographic_distribution) exist within the world's ethnically Jewish population.
1.9.2.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Jewish communities in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ethnic_divisions#Europe) include Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardi Jews, Italkim, Romaniotes and San Nicandro Jews.
1.9.2.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Jewish communities in the [Caucasus and the Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ethnic_divisions#The_Caucasus_and_the_Crimea) include Juhurim, Gruzim \(or the Georgian Jews\), Krymchaks, Crimean Karaites and Subbotniks.
1.9.2.1.4.2.1.3. Pro: Jewish communities in [North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ethnic_divisions#North_Africa), collectively known as [Maghrebi Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghrebi_Jews), include Moroccan Jews, Algerian Jews, Libyan Jews and Tunisian Jews. Jewish communities in [Sub-Saharan Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ethnic_divisions#Sub-Saharan_Africa) include the Abayudaya, Beta Israel, Descendants of the Jews of the Bilad el-Sudan \(West Africa\), the House of Israel, the emergent Igbo Jewish community of Nigeria, the Lemba people in Malawi, the Jews of Rusape and South African Jews.
1.9.2.1.4.2.1.4. Pro: Jews originating from [Muslim lands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ethnic_divisions#Middle_East) are generally called by the catch-all term [Mizrahi Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrahi_Jews), and these groups include Babylonian Jews, Kurdish Jews, Persian Jews, Yemenite Jews, Palestinian Jews, Egyptian Jews, Sudanese Jews, Lebanese Jews, Omani Jews, Syrian Jews.
1.9.2.1.4.2.1.5. Pro: Jewish communities in [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ethnic_divisions#South,_East,_and_Central_Asia) include the Bene Israel, Bukharan Jews, Cochin Jews, Syrian Malabar Nasranis, Baghdadi Jews, Bnei Menashe, Bene Ephraim, Chinese Jews, Pakistani Jews and Afghan Jews.
1.9.2.1.4.2.1.6. Pro: The great majority of recognized Jews on both the North American and South American continents are [Ashkenazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews), particularly among Jews in the United States. Some unique communities associated with the [Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ethnic_divisions#Americas) include Sephardic Bnei Anusim, Amazonian Jews, Iquitos Jews, B'nai Moshe, Veracruz Jews.
1.9.2.1.4.2.2. Pro: Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism [follow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_is_a_Jew%3F) the [Halakha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha) \(Jewish religious laws\), deeming a person to be Jewish if their [mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrilineality_in_Judaism) is Jewish or they underwent a proper conversion. Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism accept both matrilineal and [patrilineal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrilineal) descent. Karaite Judaism predominantly follows patrilineal descent.
1.9.2.1.4.2.3. Pro: Some [Israeli Jews](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/pf_2016-03-08_israel-01-13/) see their Jewish identity as religious, others as cultural or ethnic. 70% of Haredim Jews and roughly half of Datiim Jews \(52%\) believe that being Jewish is mainly a matter of religion, while 3% of Haredim and 16% of Datiim Jews believe that being Jewish is mainly a matter of ancestry and/or culture. Among Hilonim Jews, by contrast, only 4% see being Jewish as primarily a matter of religion, while 83% think Jewish identity is mainly a matter of ancestry and/or culture.
1.9.2.1.4.3. Pro: [A Pew Research Center survey](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/identity/) provided eight attributes and behaviors and asked Jews in Israel and USA whether each is essential, important or not important to what being Jewish means to them. The results show that there is little consensus among Israeli Jews and American Jews about what is essential to Jewish identity.
1.9.2.1.4.3.1. Pro: A majority of Israeli Jews \(65%\) said remembering the Holocaust is essential to their [Jewish identity](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/identity/pf_2016-03-08_israel-04-10/). Nearly half \(47%\) said living an ethical life is essential to being Jewish, while roughly one-third said observing halakha \(35%\), living in Israel \(33%\) or working for justice and equality in society \(27%\) are essential to being Jewish. Smaller shares of Jews said eating traditional Jewish foods \(18%\) and being intellectually curious \(16%\) are essential aspects of their Jewish identity.
1.9.2.1.4.3.2. Pro: [Far more American](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/16/a-closer-look-at-jewish-identity-in-israel-and-the-u-s/) than Israeli Jews say “leading an ethical and moral life” \(69% vs. 47%\) and “working for justice and equality” \(56% vs. 27%\) are vital to being Jewish. On the other hand, Israeli Jews are more likely than US Jews to say that observing Jewish law is essential to what being Jewish means to them \(35% vs. 19%\).
1.9.2.1.4.4. Pro: Israeli Jews are far from [a homogeneous group](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/08/key-findings-religion-politics-israel/). Virtually all Jews in Israel identify with one of four major religious subgroups: Hiloni \(secular\), Masorti \(traditional\), Dati \(religious\) and Haredi \(ultra-Orthodox\).
1.9.2.1.5. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.1.1.
1.9.2.1.6. Con: Religious significance alone is not enough for a people to lay claim to ownership of a city, since other competing religious beliefs have an equally legitimate claim on that basis.
1.9.2.1.6.1. Pro: The city of Jerusalem is significant in a number of religious traditions other than Judaism, including [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_significance_of_Jerusalem#In_Christianity) and [also](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-city-of-jerusalem-in-islam-2004409) [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_significance_of_Jerusalem#In_Islam).
1.9.2.1.7. Con: -> See 1.9.2.1.6.1.
1.9.2.2. Pro: Israel funds and supports programmes which seek to [preserve and protect](https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/US-Israel-agree-to-up-joint-preservation-of-European-Jewish-sites-543677) sites of cultural importance for the Jewish people globally.
1.9.2.3. Con: Israel is not the only state actor that seeks to protect Jewish culture. In the European Union, The European Association for the Preservation and Promotion of Jewish Culture and Heritage [\(AEJP\)](https://www.jewisheritage.org/web/about) supports the preservation, appreciation and promotion of Jewish culture and Jewish Heritage in Europe.
1.9.2.3.1. Pro: Agencies which seek to protect Jewish culture within their own countries are likely to be more effective at protecting their indigenous Jewish cultures as opposed to Israel, a foreign actor. This is because they have more freedom to act within their own state and are less likely to face backlash due to perceived interference.
1.9.2.4. Con: Non-state organisations such as the [Future for Religious Heritage](https://www.frh-europe.org/the-jewish-religious-heritage-in-europe-value-and-preservation/) \(FRH\) make a significant effort to protect and preserve important Jewish cultural and religious sites. Israel plays little role in these organisations and they would continue to do such work if Israel was no longer a Jewish state.
1.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.1.
1.9.4. Con: -> See 1.3.7.
1.9.5. Con: It is possible to maintain cultural legacies through non-state action.
1.9.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.4.
1.9.5.2. Pro: Jewish foundations are able to fund projects that promote and maintain Jewish cultural values.
1.9.5.2.1. Pro: Over the past three years, the [Weinberg Foundation](http://hjweinbergfoundation.org/about-us/jewish-community/) has approved grants totaling $120 million, of which 153 were $50,000 or more, serving the Jewish community within the United States and overseas.
1.9.5.3. Pro: Hebrew schools are able to pass on the traditions of Judaism to Jewish youth without state support.
1.9.5.3.1. Con: Private schooling will never go as far as public curricula to promote the cultural tradition of Judaism.
1.9.5.3.1.1. Pro: Supplementary schools that teach about Jewish culture are expensive to maintain.
1.9.5.3.1.1.1. Con: The Jewish people are lucky in that they have a large portion of the world's [most wealthy](https://forward.com/schmooze/131574/jews-dominate-forbes-rich-list/).
1.9.5.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.1.
1.9.5.3.1.1.1.2. Con: The ease with which the Law of Return grants citizenship makes the conclusion that wealthy Jews/Israelis are invested in maintaining Jewish culture tenuous at best. For instance, the wealthiest Israeli citizen is the Russian oligarch [Roman Abramovich](https://www.thejc.com/news/israel/roman-abramovich-instantly-becomes-israel-s-wealthiest-citizen-after-being-granted-passport-1.464684).
1.9.5.3.1.2. Pro: Private schools can only reach students who can afford them.
1.9.5.3.1.2.1. Con: Many Hebrew schools in the US are [free](https://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/1846543/jewish/Hebrew-Schools-Offer-Free-Programs.htm).
