Discussion Title: Does Hell Exist?

1. Hell exists
1.1. Con: Hell is not a present reality but a future punishment so in the present, it does not exist.
1.1.1. Con: If Hell is the reality created when humans chose to define right and wrong for themselves, as opposed to abiding to God’s definition of right and wrong, then Hell does exist as both a present and a future reality.
1.1.1.1. Con: Redefining Hell in the most ambiguous terms still does not make it exist.
1.1.1.2. Con: When Adam and Eve tried to choose right and wrong for themselves, and ate the fruit, they were told 'dust you are and to dust you will return.' [biblegateway.com](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen+3%3A19&version=NASB) They were the original sinners, but not punished in Hell.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: If Hell means not being near God, and Adam and Even were expelled from the Eden, then they were punished with Hell.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The Garden of Eden was a finite space on Earth, where God had His throne and His council all together, and where Adam and Eve were created and assigned the mission of expanding the Eden and God's council on Earth. But when they sinned, they were expelled from Eden, which means that they were no longer near God, they weren't one of God's "children" in the divine council anymore. Hell, then, by definition, is this status of not being part of God's "family" and council anymore.
1.1.1.3. Con: The claim presumes an existence of a deity defining norms for the human behavior, which is [disputed](https://www.kialo.com/the-existence-of-god-2629/2629.0=2629.1/=2629.1).
1.1.2. Con: Hell as a punishment does not exist.
1.1.2.1. Pro: There is no need to punish someone who brings suffering upon themselves through sinning.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The nature of sin is that it brings suffering upon the sinner and those around the sinner.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: Jesus [mentions](https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-24.htm) how it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day judgement than for towns that rejected Him. This implies that Sodom and Gomorrah have been punished once already and will be punished again in the future.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Hell is a reality of suffering people choose to create by deciding to define right and wrong for themselves as opposed to abiding by God’s definition of right and wrong.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: God’s definition of right and wrong is such that any human choice which brings about suffering, even on the smallest scale, is wrong.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: This can’t be true as Jesus willingly suffered on the cross, and He is without sin.
1.1.3. Pro: The future cannot exist in the present moment. Therefore, Hell, a place we supposedly go if we die as sinners in the future, cannot exist.
1.1.3.1. Con: By this logic however, Hell can exist in the same present time for those who are currently present there.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Jacob expected to go there. He knew Sheol is just the grave. [biblegateway.com](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen+42%3A38&version=NASB)
1.1.4. Con: Even if this assertion about the nature of Hell is granted, this only proves that Hell does not exist yet. This establishes little ground in a debate about whether or not Hell exists at all.
1.1.5. Con: This presupposes a universal understanding and meaning of that which neither humans or the Bible articulate with a modicum certainty.
1.1.6. Con: Hell is a present reality for those that are there currently. The Bible mentions the story of the [rich man and Lazarus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+16%3A19-31&version=NIV) and the rich man calls out from Hell so that his family could be saved.
1.1.6.1. Con: Stories from the Bible are not to be taken as reality.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: It is clear from other passages that the lessons from this story were meant to be taken literally. In general, New Testament authors wrote to immortalize real events. New Testament characters take Old Testament figures as historic.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Other Bible passages support the idea of a present Hell. Isaiah 57 speaks of [rest](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-2.htm) in death for the righteous, but verse [21](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-21.htm) says the wicked will not rest, implying while alive and, from the prior context, dead. Their place of death must be a different place, one lacking rest.
1.2. Pro: The concept of Hell \(or a hell type afterlife\) has shown to be prominent in cultures around the world throughout history.
1.2.1. Con: Having a concept of Hell is to be expected from a species with an inherent sense of justice, however it does not prove that Hell exists.
1.2.2. Con: Many mythologies have [common roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_religion) that drift apart and change over time much like language and other cultural traits.
1.2.2.1. Pro: A Christian doctrine cannot be based on mythology. A doctrine from mythology is inherently untrue.
1.2.3. Pro: Judaism has Sheol.

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheol)
1.2.3.1. Con: Hell as defined by the Bible only means the grave. The Hebrew word was Sheol. In Greek it was Hades. 
[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_Hell)
1.2.3.1.1. Con: The Bible describes a place of [eternal punishment](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A46&version=ESV) and[eternal fire](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A8&version=ESV) which is [away from the presence of the Lord](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+1%3A9&version=ESV) without using the word "Hell."
1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Hell is how gehenna is translated. But, in Matthew 10:28 note that gehenna is where both body and soul are *destroyed*. See footnote b.
[biblegateway.com](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10%3A28&version=ISV)
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Jesus warned of something more serious than the grave, destruction. Gehenna, the word Jesus used, is often translated as Hell. But Gei Hinnom was the Jerusalem city dump, where garbage etc was deposited. The dead bodies of criminals were also disposed there. No live criminals were punished there, though. In Revelation, Gehenna is the Lake of Fire, a symbol of destruction. Not a symbol of punishment. See footnote: [biblegateway.com](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10%3A28&version=ESV)
1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: Revelation does not say Gehenna is the Lake of Fire. The Greek translation of Rev. 20:10 is limnen tou pyros, not Gehenna. This link provides over 20 translations of the verse and none of them say Gehenna. They all say Lake of Fire. [biblehub.com](https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm)
1.2.3.1.2.1.1. Con: The lake of fire and Gehenna are both symbols of destruction.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Sheol is also called 'the grave' in the KJ. Rather than a place of torment, a place of sleep, until the resurrection. This is also in agreement with what the Christian Scriptures say, for example writing of people who had fallen asleep rather than having died. [biblehub.com](http://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm) [biblehub.com](http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm)
1.2.4. Con: The concept of Hell is socially constructed, which means that this concept is relative to other cultures. Therefore "hell" is not the same thing in other societies.
1.2.5. Con: [Most](http://www.sikhanswers.com/god-and-his-universe/hell-an-heaven/) cultures have an afterlife with the classic good/neutral/bad outcomes.   The definition of good/bad, the description of the outcomes, the length of time, are all wildly different.   Without sufficient commonality, all we can assert is that [most](https://www.hafsite.org/hinduism-essentials/qa-booklet#Heaven) cultures believed in morality and a punishment / reward model.
1.2.6. Pro: The idea of Hell is found commonly in different cultures possibly due to common global geologic observations. These include lava flows, volcanic activity, and other fearful geologic phenomenon.
1.2.6.1. Pro: These often frightening types of geologic phenomenon are found on all continents, which can explain the universal nature of a "Hell". From ancient peoples' standpoint, these widespread geologic features provide mutual evidence for Hell is underneath us.
1.2.7. Con: The concept that the Earth is flat has shown to be prominent around the world throughout history, but was decisively falsified. Majority voting is by far not a secure way to establish facts, in particular about the existence of a Hell.
1.2.8. Pro: [Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_hell#Hell_in_the_New_Testament) have views of Hell.
1.2.8.1. Con: Not all [Christians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_theology) had / have [views](https://medium.com/\@BrazenChurch/how-when-the-idea-of-eternal-torment-invaded-church-doctrine-7610e6b70815) of Hell.
1.2.8.2. Con: People having views of something does not prove that this thing exists.
1.2.9. Pro: The ancient [Sumerians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer) had a view of Hell called [Kur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kur).
1.2.9.1. Con: The first sentence of the cited Wikipedia article on Kur reads: "All souls went to the same afterlife, and a person's actions during life had no effect on how the person would be treated in the world to come." Thus, Kur may not be considered as Hell.
1.2.10. Pro: The [ancient Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_religion) believed in a [lake of fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_of_fire#Ancient_Egyptian_religion).
1.2.10.1. Con: Egyptian mythology was very heterogeneous. According to the Egyptian [Book of the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_the_Dead), the sinister souls that could not pass the divine trial were eaten by the underworld monster and ceased to exist altogether. There was thus no division of the underworld into Heaven and Hell.
1.2.11. Pro: The [ancient Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology) believed in an [underworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_underworld) with a deepest pit called [tartarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus).
1.3. Pro: According to the Bible, Hell exists.
1.3.1. Con: The ideas of Hell and God both predate the Bible. [The first five books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament) are estimated to have been first written down about 1000 years after the pyramids were built.
1.3.1.1. Con: This is inconsistent with [material](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+8&version=NASB) in the Bible itself.
1.3.2. Con: The word Hell [is of germanic origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell#Etymology) and part of pagan folklore.
1.3.2.1. Con: The word in the Bible is Greek. English or German can only be a translation.
1.3.3. Con: Any suggestion of Hell comes also from the Bible. Recently the Catholic search revised its Bible version of Genesis claiming now that the evolution is a respectable option of human creation. The church is re tracking now Bible's Hell version as well. [30ce.com](http://30ce.com/helltoday.htm)
1.3.4. Pro: The texts within the Bible does not leave room for an interpretation of Hell such as annihilationism or purgatory. Hell is the eternal right judgement of God and is spoken of as both real and conscious separation from the godhead.
1.3.4.1. Con: The [Bible](http://biblehub.com/psalms/94-23.htm) says the wicked will be destroyed.
1.3.4.2. Con: In the parable of the [dragnet](http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-47.htm), the Bible says the angels decide which fish are put in vessels and which are thrown out. The parable does not say Hell is the judgment of God.
1.3.4.3. Con: The definition of Hell as "the judgment" is too ambiguous. The topic of this discussion is whether Hell exists, not whether judgment exists.
1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.3.6. Pro: Paul teaches in [2 Thessalonians 1:8-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+1%3A8-10&version=NIV) that those who "do not know God" and who "do not obey the Gospel" will "suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord."
1.3.6.1. Con: Paul teaches the wicked are destroyed. He is saying it is "eternal" because the destruction can not be reversed.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: The broader usage of the word [eternal](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G166&t=ESV) in the New Testament does not substantiate that interpretation. It is more reasonable to understand "eternal destruction" as a synonym of ["eternal fire"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+25%3A41&version=ESV) or ["eternal punishment"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A46&version=ESV), which are used interchangeably in [Matthew 25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+25&version=ESV).
1.3.6.1.1.1. Con: [Matt 25](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+25/) contains the parable of the 10 virgins, where the punishment is not going to the feast. It does not say the feast is eternal. The passage also contains the parable of the Talents. The punishment is being escorted to the "outer darkness." It does not say this is forever.
1.3.6.1.2. Con: Rather than understanding the words "eternal destruction" to mean they are destroyed, it is more reasonable to conclude they go on and on in a fiery torture.
1.3.6.2. Con: In this passage, Paul says "[in the day](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+1%3A8-10&version=NIV)" Jesus returns, some will be destroyed and some will be shut out. It's not about the myth of Hell, but about the [millennial kingdom](https://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/revelation/related-topics/summary-of-the-millennial-kingdom.html).
1.3.6.3. Pro: So eternal destruction is eternal death.
1.3.7. Con: If the penalty for sin is eternal torment in fire, then Jesus did not pay the penalty for sin as Christians claim.
1.3.7.1. Pro: In order for Jesus to pay the penalty for sin, Jesus would have to suffer a punishment of eternal fire, which He did not.
1.3.7.1.1. Con: Jesus' atonement for sin is only effectual for those who [place faith in Jesus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+3%3A16-18&version=ESV).
1.3.7.2. Pro: If Jesus paid the penalty for sin, then it is not right for any sinner to suffer in Hell.
1.3.7.3. Con: Jesus did [appease](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/devotionals/cup-jesus-drinks/) God's wrath, and God sends people to Hell to appease his [wrath](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/biblical-evidence-hell/).
1.3.8. Con: This is a logical fallacy that presumes the answer in order to prove it. by [rationalwiki.org](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning)
1.3.8.1. Con: The veracity of the Bible is not dependent on the existence of Hell.
1.3.9. Con: Just because the concept of "Hell" is mentioned in the Bible doesn't make it real.
1.3.10. Con: There are [arguments](http://brazenchurch.com/hell-in-the-bible/) that the Bible does not say that, and that this was an interpretation added later.
1.3.10.1. Con: A [dichotomy](https://www.biblehub.com/matthew/25-46.htm) of "Heaven and Hell" is a constant theme throughout the Bible.
1.3.10.1.1. Pro: [Isaiah 57](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+57&version=NIV) is an example in the Old Testament. The beginning of the chapter mentions that, in death, there is rest for the righteous. The end of the chapter mentions that there is no rest for the wicked.
1.3.11. Pro: Hell grows with fear, Heaven grows with love. The world shrinks as you shrink and the world grows as you grow.
1.3.12. Con: The Bible is not quite a reliable scientific source.
1.3.12.1. Pro: The writers of the Bible weren't scientists. They saw the world not as a place of objects, but as a drama.
1.3.12.1.1. Con: The writers of the Bible intended to communicate historical facts. It is reasonable to assume that they would also attempt to communicate scientific facts, to the extent that they were known and relevant. Even if they conceived of the events of history as a drama, that would not preclude their understanding of the events as historical rather than mythical.
1.3.12.1.1.1. Pro: 1 Chronicles provides an extensive genealogy starting with [Adam](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+chronicles+1%3A1&version=ESV) and tracing his lineage all the way through the [Kings of Israel](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+chronicles+3&version=ESV). This sort of detail would not be necessary unless the the author considered the people and the events surrounding their lives to be historical.
1.3.12.1.1.2. Pro: [Luke](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+1%3A1-4&version=ESV) writes to Theophilus that he may have certainty concerning the testimony of those who were eyewitnesses to the events of Jesus' life. It is clear from this that both the authors and the audience regarded the New Testament as history, not myth, fable, or parable.
1.3.12.1.1.3. Con: The writers of the Bible lived in different ages, different locations and made different kinds of literary works. Genesis, Psalms, Song of Songs, Romans and Revelation are all completely different kinds of texts and making a general claim about their genre as a whole is a mistake.
1.3.12.1.1.4. Con: We don't know [who wrote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_authorship) portions of the Bible, so it's difficult to consider such a broad claim as what the "writers" of the Bible intended. This [site claims authorship](http://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/who-wrote-the-bible), but it says Peter was the author of 2 Peter, [which is contested](https://bible.org/article/2-peter-peter%E2%80%99s). But whoever wrote 2 Peter did not intend to allude to Hell as a place of eternal torment. [2 Peter 2:12 says the evil will "perish," not go on forever.](http://biblehub.com/commentaries/2_peter/2-12.htm)
1.3.12.1.2. Pro: Conservative theologians like [NT Wright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BP1PpDyDCw), Progressive ones like [Rob Bell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2rklwkm_dQ&t) and psychologists like [Jordan Peterson](https://jordanbpeterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/12_Rules_Christmas_Package.pdf) all make this claim in their works.
1.3.12.1.3. Pro: Science as we understand it is only a couple of centuries old. It wasn't a way of looking at the wold in the time of the writers of the biblical stories.
1.3.12.1.4. Con: The[writers of the Bibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorship_of_the_Bible) are not all known and there isn't a general consensus on what their view of the world was at the time of its writing.
1.3.12.2. Con: Much of what the Bible says has physical evidence, such as what it says about demons. [washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/07/01/as-a-psychiatrist-i-diagnose-mental-illness-and-sometimes-demonic-possession/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.34e5157cf7c2)
1.3.12.3. Con: That the Bible is not a reliable scientific source says nothing as to whether it is a reliable historical source, and so nothing as to whether it rightly depicts the history of God's actions in the world.
1.3.12.3.1. Con: Things like the existence of Hell and other claims in the Bible are affirmation about the world and nature, which justifies scientific scrutiny, and which they cannot withstand.
1.3.13. Con: According to DC Comics, the book on which we base the existence of Superman, the fortress of solitude exists. Therefore, literature is not adequate proof.
1.3.13.1. Con: According to this logic, we should dismiss all of recorded history because it is apparently meaningless.
1.3.13.1.1. Con: Interpretation of recorded history is always just tentative. The more ancient, the less reliable, unless corroborated by different sources, which is not the case of the most important claims of the Bible.
1.3.13.2. Pro: It is not because literature can show us some historical facts like buildings, journalists, politicians, cities, that it is evidence of all things like the "fortress of solitude" or Hell.
1.3.13.3. Con: We do not believe Superman exists, and so do not base the existence of superman on DC Comics.
1.3.13.4. Con: The Bible is not any literature, but a piece of history.
1.3.13.5. Con: DC books are marketed as fiction, while the Bible was complied by a group of people who believed it to be the inspired word of God.
1.3.14. Pro: A [lake of fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_of_fire#"Lake_of_fire"_in_the_Book_of_Revelation) is referenced multiple times in Revelations.
1.3.14.1. Con: Mt. Doom is referenced multiple times in The Hobbit.  This is not evidence for the existence of Mt. Doom.
1.3.14.1.1. Con: This is a known work of fictional literature. The Bible is a religious book considered historically true.
1.3.14.1.1.1. Con: The Bible is consistently [wrong](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Biblical_scientific_errors) about science and cosmology and [frequently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_the_Bible) describes historical events that are contradicted by more reliable sources.
1.3.14.1.1.2. Con: The Bible is not, as a whole, considered to be historically true or a reliable source of history. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_the_Bible)
1.3.14.1.1.3. Con: All religious books are fiction to the people who don't follow that particular religion.
1.3.14.1.1.3.1. Con: 'Fiction' is not the genre most people would attribute to sacred texts outside of their own religious tradition.
1.3.14.2. Con: It is true the Book of Revelation mentions the Lake of Fire. In one of those references in the Church of England's authorized "King James" version, Rev. 20:14, it says Hell is thrown into the Lake of Fire. That suggests that the biblical reference to the Lake of Fire is not intended to be a description of Hell, but of a final destination for Hell. It would make no sense to say Hell is thrown into Hell.
1.3.14.3. Con: If we start interpreting The Book of Revelation literally in the very last chapters, we really should do it all through the book. But the vivid, metaphorical language - the Greek drama played out in the bulk of the text - suggests otherwise.
1.3.15. Pro: The[parable of the sheep and goats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sheep_and_the_Goats) in Matthew references an 'eternal fire'.
1.3.15.1. Con: [In Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings), Gandalf mentions Mordor.  This is not evidence for the existence of Mordor.
1.3.15.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.14.1.1.
1.3.15.2. Con: The King James, NIV, ESV, American Standard and Youngs literal translation all say "eternal punishment." It is not translated eternal "fire." 
Here is a link to Bible Hub that shows 22 versions of Matt 25:46. They all say punishment.
[biblehub.com](http://biblehub.com/parallel/matthew/25-46.htm)
1.3.15.2.1. Con: "Eternal fire" is used just a few verses earlier in [Matthew 25:41](http://biblehub.com/parallel/matthew/25-41.htm) as part of the same [parable](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+25%3A31-46&version=ESV). This suggests that the terms are being used interchangeably to refer to the same thing.
1.3.15.3. Con: The teaching of [sheep and goats is about nations](http://www.pray4zion.org/SeparatingtheSheepfromtheGoats.html). It says "all nations will be gathered before him." Augustine of Hippo does not suggest [Hell for nations](https://soundandsilence.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/eternal-punishment-in-augustine%E2%80%99s-the-city-of-god/), but for deserving individuals. The teaching in "sheep and goats" eludes to a fire for spiritual beings  [Matt 25:41.](http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-41.htm) This could be a hint at Jesus' later revelation of the [Lake of Fire](http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm), which is not Hell, but the final destination for [death and Hades](http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-14.htm).
1.3.15.3.1. Con: Though the parable says Hell is for the devil and his angels, it also says that the [goats are sent there](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A41&version=ESV). If it is true that the parable is about nations, then it would seem that the Bible does in fact support Hell for nations. If the parable is not about nations, then it seems that the Bible supports Hell for individuals. Either way, the parable teaches the existence of Hell.
1.3.15.3.1.1. Pro: The introductory sentence says nations. [Matt 25:32 Berean Literal Bible](http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-32.htm)
And all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
1.3.15.3.1.1.1. Pro: God's judgment of nations is a biblical concept. Here is just one [example](http://biblehub.com/joel/3-2.htm): 'Then I have gathered all the nations, And caused them to go down unto the valley of Jehoshaphat, And I have been judged with them there, Concerning My people and Mine inheritance -- Israel, Whom they scattered among nations, And My land they have apportioned.'
1.3.15.3.1.2. Pro: Many Jews of Jesus' time expected the [Messiah to push](https://www.thattheworldmayknow.com/the-jewish-revolts) Rome out of the land and his apostles were interested in the [Messianic kingdom](http://www.bereanbiblechurch.org/transcripts/mark/13_3-4.htm) to come. 
The sheep and goats prophecy is about the Messianic Kingdom, not about the myth of Hell.
1.3.15.3.1.3. Con: The prophecy does not reference a place for the goats. It merely says they [go into the fire](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A31-46&version=NIV.). That could mean a spiritual fire that has no physical place.
1.3.15.3.2. Pro: The sheep and goats teaching is a [prophecy, not a parable.](https://gracethrufaith.com/end-times-prophecy/the-sheep-and-goat-judgment-matt-2531-46/)
1.3.15.3.3. Pro: The prophecy of sheep and goats does not say Hell is for the devil and his angels. It says the goats go into a ["fire" that was intended for the devil and demons.](http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-41.htm)
1.3.15.3.4. Pro: The prophecy of the sheep and goats says Jesus will [reward nations that are charitable](http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-40.htm) and kind to the least of these and [punish those who are not](http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-45.htm). It does not mention Hell.
1.3.15.3.5. Pro: [Matthew presents Jesus' teaching just before the narrative leading to the crucifixion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivet_Discourse)[Jesus' apostles are keenly interested in his fulfillment of messianic prophecy.](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt%2024.3)  Jesus does not take this opportunity to introduce the myth of Hell, but but tells his followers he [will sit on a throne.](http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm)
1.3.15.4. Pro: Fire has many [different meanings](https://www.riverlifemn.com/article-list/2014/628/what-does-fire-represent-in-the-bible-what-about-in-matthew-311-and-1-corinthians-315) in the Bible. 
God ordered the fire on the altar Lev 6:13 to never go out. That does not mean it was Hell.
1.3.15.5. Con: Eternal punishment translates 'kolasin aionion.' Kolasin basically means lopping off, as in pruning. i.e. destruction. [biblegateway.com](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A46&version=WHNU)
1.4. Con: The concept of Hell is a coercive idea propagated to influence people's behaviour.
1.4.1. Pro: Hell is a myth created to keep the people under religious control.
1.4.1.1. Con: The idea of Hell is older than the medieval church.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: The idea of a punishing afterlife does pre-date the Medieval Church \(re: St. Augustine\) but the translation of Old Testament words like Sheol and Hades as Hell was popularized after Medieval times. Circa 1611 . [www.christiancourier.com](https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/406-use-of-hell-in-the-new-testament-the)
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Logically \(no data exists far enough back\) the concept of control could predate the idea of Hell. This goes to the chicken \(humanity created as-is\) and egg \(evolution\) dilemma. Since there is insufficient data going that far back, the idea of which came first \(control or Hell\) is speculation.
1.4.1.2. Pro: In the middle-ages, a person could pay [the church](http://www.csis.pace.edu/grendel/projs2c/middle.html) \(indulges\) to pay off their sins \(except murder\).
1.4.1.3. Pro: Fear is a powerful tool for controlling behavior.
1.4.1.4. Con: The concept has been used to keep people under control, but it's impossible to prove that it has been 'created' for this purpose.
1.4.1.5. Pro: It is much more likely that Hell was useful myth since it fits what we know of human behavior.
1.4.1.6. Con: Considering more people now than past have less belief in faith and/or less adherence to religion and/or religious practice, such assertion appears untenable; moreover, this assertion fails to negate the claim.
1.4.1.7. Pro: The rules for getting into Hell can be obscure and not logical.
1.4.1.7.1. Con: Life is full of obscure and unlogical rules. The afterlife can thus similarly be governed by obscure and illogical rules. Thus perceived  unfairness does not support the fact that Hell doesn't exist.
1.4.1.7.2. Con: The root of sin is [refusing to honor God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+1%3A21&version=ESV). People are not sent to Hell for failing to abide by a few obscure rules, but for refusing to praise the one true God who made them.
1.4.1.7.3. Con: Simply because one perceives rules as obscure and illogical does not constitute a negation of such rules: e.g. how is gravity logical?
1.4.1.7.4. Con: Hell is the necessary and logical consequence of two fundamental Christian doctrines: 1\) God is Love and 2\) human beings have free will \(to accept or reject/separate themselves from God's love\).
1.4.1.7.4.1. Con: This leads to the dilemma of God is omniscient \(can forsee all outcomes and what leads to them\), omnibenevolent \(does not want anyone to suffer for eternity\), and omnipotent \(is empowered to make all changes necessary to ensure humans make choices that don't lead to eternal doom\).  Including at a minimum providing a single, clear, universal set of rules that all humans know to be true.  So either there is no God, no Hell, or God is limited.
1.4.1.7.5. Con: While there were many rules given to the Jews before Christ\(Prior to the holy spirit descending upon believers\), after Christ came there was only one rule for getting into heaven and avoiding Hell.["If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.](http://biblehub.com/romans/10-9.htm)
1.4.1.7.5.1. Con: Here are other rules for avoiding Hell.
1. [Matt 16:16 - you must be baptized](http://biblehub.com/mark/16-16.htm).
 2. [You must repent Luke 13:3](http://biblehub.com/luke/13-3.htm). 
3. [You must live in sinless perfection](http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-6.htm). Heb 6:6.
4. [You must have oil in your lamp.](http://www.bibleresearch.org/prophecybook2/b2w4.html)
5. [You must give the naked some clothing.](http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-36.htm)
6. [You must be a good fish](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A47-50&version=NKJV).
7. [You can not rely on the law for justification Gal 5:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A47-50&version=NKJV)
8. Christians tell people you are saved by belief, but even the [demons believe](http://biblehub.com/james/2-19.htm).
9. You must wear the right clothing [Matt 22:11](http://biblehub.com/james/2-19.htm)
1.4.1.7.6. Pro: Some believe Hell is a final judgement for those who commit crimes throughout their lives.
1.4.1.7.6.1. Con: If people repent they won't go to Hell, regardless of their offenses.
1.4.1.7.6.1.1. Con: This logic assumes that all people are of the same religious belief that Hell exist and they must repent. This is not the case, therefore it is likely repenting is unnecessary for majority of people in this world.
1.4.1.7.6.1.1.1. Con: Repentance may include coming to right belief, and so makes no such presumption.
1.4.1.7.6.2. Con: Hell is the desire of those who desire sin.
1.4.1.7.6.2.1. Pro: Assuming Hell is a present reality on Earth, sin is only permitted in Hell. [What will be permitted in the Kindom of Heaven.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21&version=NIV)
1.4.1.7.6.2.1.1. Pro: Sin is not permitted in the Kingdom of Heaven.
1.4.1.7.6.3. Con: Punishment for crimes seems like a perfectly logical reason for someone to go to Hell. People who commit crimes like murder and rape are generally regarded as being worthy of Hell. This does not support the idea that people are sent to Hell for petty and arbitrary reasons.
1.4.1.8. Con: Mythology emanates from the human unconscious; therefore, myth is created by something we do not fully understand and cannot control.    [The Hero with a Thousand Faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces)
1.4.1.9. Pro: The very effectiveness of the myth shows that it has a reality, at least in a subjective sense.
1.4.1.10. Con: The absence of Hell is a myth created to keep people under the control of greed, lust, and pride.
1.4.1.10.1. Pro: People often use the propensity of greed and lust and pride in other people to control them manipulatively through advertising, seduction, and flattery.
1.4.2. Pro: The hellfire doctrine is just another way to extract money from the flock by intimidation, preaching about the evils of Hell and then passing the plate.
1.4.2.1. Con: There exist those who preach hell without insisting / asking for money. Jesus Christ is one example.
1.4.3. Con: The idea of Hell can be used in this way. But this does not imply that it does not exist.
1.5. Con: There are many religions/cultural beliefs which do not believe in Hell.
1.5.1. Pro: [Atheists](http://www.religionfacts.com/atheism) do not believe in the existence of Hell.
1.5.2. Pro: [Confucianism](http://www.religionfacts.com/confucianism) does not address the existence of Hell.
1.5.3. Con: Not believing in the existence of Hell is not evidence that it does not exist, as there are many things that are not universally believed in but exist in this world.
1.5.3.1. Pro: There are people that believe Earth is flat. Today, that is a clearly false statement, but they still believe it.
1.5.3.2. Con: [Russel's Teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot). Burden of proof lies upon a person making unfalsifiable claims, rather than shifting the burden of disproof to others.
1.5.4. Pro: If \(according to many religions\) someone does not know about the religion, they are given the benefit when they die to not be punished for it.
1.5.4.1. Con: For the Christian Worldview: Paul states in [Romans 1:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A20&version=NIV) - "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse"  So those that don't believe have no excuse because of the evidence given to them in the form of creation.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Had Paul believed in Hell, he might have let this secret out somewhere in this 24-verse sermon about the results of non-belief. Instead, he says [they perish](http://biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm).
1.5.5. Pro: Hell does not exist in [Scientology](https://www.scientology.org/faq/scientology-beliefs/does-scientology-have-doctrines.html).
1.5.6. Pro: Jews don't generally believe in Hell. [myjewishlearning.com](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/heaven-and-hell-in-jewish-tradition/)
1.5.7. Pro: Many traditional societies [lack the concept of afterlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife#Traditional_African_religions) whatsoever.
1.5.8. Con: Operating on the basis that it isn't possible for every religion/culture to be completely right in regards to the existence/depictions of Hell, it logically follows that most people are wrong, which means that even those who know there is a Hell but it isn't their Hell are grouped with the non-believers.
1.5.8.1. Con: A religion is never right for religion and their scriptures are based on belief, not on facts.
1.6. Pro: Philosophical and psychological theories support the existence of Hell in some form.
1.6.1. Pro: Hell exists as the total inability to express a conscience.
1.6.1.1. Con: There is no way for this to be known, or proven as truth.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: There is no scientifically valid evidence that can give us interesting information on the afterlife, to the point that there is no evidence that it exists.
1.6.1.1.2. Con: The completely "different" nature of the afterlife means that the normal laws of matter do not apply to it. Which is why we can only build a map based on the reports of those who report having seen it.
1.6.1.2. Pro: [Lack of conscience](http://truediscipleship.com/lack-conscience-overcoming-sin-christ/) is considered living in sin, and therefore living in Hell. Without it, one cannot comprehend and live by the word of God.
1.6.1.3. Con: This definition of Hell is ambiguous. What you are referencing here might be Gehenna, which is linked by Jesus to a failure of conscience in the sermon on the mount. 
[www.sermononthemount.org.uk](http://www.sermononthemount.org.uk/Background/Gehenna.html)
1.6.1.4. Con: Lack of conscience does not prove the existence of Hell.
1.6.2. Pro: Hell is a description that evokes certain emotions, so it has symbolic and imaginary value in human experience, which is a subjective reality.
1.6.2.1. Con: Unless you imagine you are currently in Hell \(which is probably rare amongst people\), then simply imagining Hell exists does not create a subjective reality of Hell.
1.6.3. Pro: Hell is an object of the collective unconscious proposed by Jung.  [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious#/media/File:Sandro_Botticelli_-_La_Carte_de_l%27Enfer.jpg)
1.6.3.1. Pro: It does not exist as a literal place but must be understood as the spiritual underworld that most religions painted.  It is equivalent in understanding as "the place you do not want to go". It is a concept that everyone understand intuitively due to our connection to the collective unconscious. It is not punishment, it is a necessary part of the struggle of life.[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNcgBAFDBP8)
1.6.3.2. Con: As per the [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious), "Hell represents, among every culture, the disturbing aspect of the collective unconscious". This refers to a conceptual construct not a literal locating. Most of Jung asserts that our mythology is a way for humanity to explore and discuss it's own psyche.
1.6.4. Pro: All things in the Universe were designed to reach and keep balance. If there is a Heaven, then Hell must exist. \(The ultimate universal "balancer" is entropy\).
1.6.4.1. Con: The existence of heaven cannot be used to justify the existence of Hell. There is no additional evidence of the former compared to the latter.
1.6.5. Pro: Justice demands the existence of Hell and Heaven.
1.6.5.1. Con: [Punishment in the afterlife](http://www.neatorama.com/2014/05/16/Punishment-in-the-Afterlife/) does not require the modern myth of Hell.
1.6.5.2. Con: The punishment of the wicked is destruction. Here is a [bibical example of punishment](http://The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads of many countries \(Psalm 110:5-6\).) that does not require a perpetual fire. "The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads of many countries [\(Psalm 110:5-6\).](http://biblehub.com/context/psalms/110-5.htm)
1.6.5.3. Pro: Without a reward or punishment after death, there can be no objective reason to behave morally.
1.6.5.3.1. Con: Atheists do not fear Hell, but are moral.
1.6.5.3.2. Con: Human beings possess [mirror neurons](http://www.apa.org/monitor/oct05/mirror.aspx) which reliably trigger \(and can predict\) [empathy](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180105124023.htm) and 'ethics'.
1.6.5.3.3. Con: There is a reasonable argument that morality is a product of [evolution](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/12/evolution-of-morality-social-humans-and-apes/418371/), serving a role in survival of the fittest 'group'.
1.6.5.4. Con: The universe does not guarantee justice and nothing in natural in our world or the natural world implies 'justice'
1.6.5.5. Con: Everlasting punishment for what is done in a very brief lifespan of, at best, a few decades would be unjust. And God is never unjust.
1.6.5.6. Con: Justice does not need the postponing of its action to the afterlife. That is just a tool to ease people's pain after being subject to an injustice that goes unpunished.
1.6.6. Pro: "One of the key tenets of Neoplatonic thought adopted by Augustine was that humans possess an immortal soul. This was a critical step in his developing the idea that unbelievers could be made to endure eternal torment in Hell." [vision.org](http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/origin-of-hell/41044.aspx)
1.6.7. Con: Psychology deals with human mind, so it cannot prove existence of Hell.
1.7. Con: Accounts of Hell differ wildly and tend to be more allegoric than literal; for example, [Dante's Inferno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_\(Dante\)).
1.7.1. Con: Just because a person, place, thing, or concept can be poorly described, misused, etc., does not mean that it does not exist.
1.8. Con: Eternal punishment for finite crimes is incompatible with an omni-benevolent God.
1.8.1. Con: Disobeying an eternal God in order to [usurp](https://www.biblehub.com/genesis/3-5.htm) His power is not a finite crime.
1.8.1.1. Con: Not all disobedience is based on power.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: All disobedience is a statement, by action, of "I will do it my way and not the way prescribed by the authority." It is very much about power.
1.8.1.2. Con: There's an infinity involved, but it's not relevant in a way that makes it a more heinous crime.
1.8.1.2.1. Con: If God is meant to be our King forever, and then we rebel and try to take that right away from Him, He is right to punish us forever.
1.8.1.2.1.1. Pro: We can't possibly take God's power away, but our desire to do so makes us guilty of the punishment fit for such treason.
1.8.2. Pro: The idea that an omnibenevolent and omniscient God would create sin, create people in the knowledge they were going to sin, and then punish them for following a path which had been predetermined for them since the beginning of time is highly illogical.
1.8.2.1. Con: Foreknowledge is not predetermination.
1.8.2.2. Con: Humans are not logical enough to call God illogical.
1.8.2.2.1. Pro: The initial conditions of the first humans were more than reasonable. They lived in a place that was "[very good](https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-31.htm)" and could do all they wanted except for [one](https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-17.htm) thing. They acted very illogically.
1.8.3. Pro: An all-powerful God who allows souls to be sent into eternal suffering is less compassionate than many of the humans who are being judged.
1.8.3.1. Con: It is doubtful that there is any person who hasn't [wished ill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_5:22#Analysis) on someone else before when it actually wasn't justified. So all of us are guilty of creating a hell for others, even if it is only in our minds. Surely, none of us is better than God.
1.8.4. Con: A finite act of [repentance](https://biblehub.com/acts/3-19.htm) can take away the eternal punishment. This is a more-than-fair act of restitution.
1.9. Con: There are scientific reasons to reject the existence of Hell.
1.9.1. Pro: By any traditional definition, Hell is eternal. Per the second law of thermodynamics, all realms are subject to entropy and therefore cannot be eternal. The second law is well-supported by science, and the notion that there can be an exception to it is merely speculative.
1.9.1.1. Con: Many notions of Hell suggest it is where souls go, and since souls aren't physical, the 2nd law of thermodynamics may not apply to Hell.
1.9.2. Pro: The presence of Hell cannot be scientifically proven.
1.9.2.1. Pro: The strength of love between two people cannot be scientifically measured or proven. Therefore, science cannot prove the existence or amount of everything.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: Given a set of parameters science could measure the amount of love between two people.
1.9.2.1.2. Pro: If the Universe is infinite then its totality will never be measured.
1.9.2.1.3. Con: The strength of love [may be measured](http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/08/health/la-he-love8-2010feb08).
1.9.2.2. Pro: The idea of Hell is a mental construct and thus no physical evidence is available to be tested.
1.9.2.2.1. Pro: [Studies](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-big-questions/200909/why-and-how-afterlife-belief-occurs) have shown that because we know we will die, we want to believe in some continuity of ourselves, be it physical or spiritual. So we have zero facts for Hell, but studies showing why we want to believe in a Hell or Heaven.
1.9.2.2.2. Con: Mental construct exists, existence and physicality are not equivalent.  Therefore Hell being a mental construct does exist, as does Middle-Earth or Gotham city.
1.9.2.2.3. Pro: The brain is a physical thing that can not survive the death of the body. There is no reason to think that there is an afterlife, let alone Hell.
1.9.2.2.3.1. Con: The brain cannot survive the death of the body, but the mind may survive it and go on to an afterlife, and thus the brains inability to survive death says nothing of the existence of an Hell nor an afterlife more generally.
1.9.2.3. Con: Scientific proof is a [myth](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/11/22/scientific-proof-is-a-myth/#26b887a92fb1).
1.9.2.3.1. Pro: Nothing is science can truly be proven as scientific evidence is limited in what it can replicate to be true in every instance.
1.9.2.3.2. Con: Absolute proof does not exist but science relies on evidence, which, when strong enough, provide a degree of certainty that can be be trusted for all practical purposes.
1.9.2.3.3. Con: The Forbes article uses a very common misconception; an error that scientific proof requires finding an absolute consensus. It only requires a majority consensus "of the scientific community" for it to be taken as fact. There is no weight considered on the views of laypeople.
1.9.2.3.3.1. Pro: Scientific proof requires only a majority consensus that a idea fits the evidence of proof, such as Newtons theories on gravity, or that the earth is round, or that global warming exists.
1.9.2.3.3.2. Pro: Scientific proof does not even require a consensus of the scientific community. It requires the predictions of a theory to comply with the measured values with statistical significance under required error level.
1.9.2.3.4. Con: Forbes is hardly a reliable source for establishing the nature of science and scientific method.
1.9.2.4. Con: The nonexistense of Hell cannot be scientifically proven.
1.9.2.4.1. Pro: The Bible proves the nonexistence of the common concept of Hell.
1.9.2.4.1.1. Pro: There is an extensive discussion in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 of the resurrection. [jw.org](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/study-bible/books/1-corinthians/15/) Verses 12-57
1.9.2.4.1.2. Pro: Romans 6:7 states that the dead are free, acquitted from, etc. sin. [biblehub.com](http://biblehub.com/romans/6-7.htm)
1.9.2.4.1.3. Pro: Romans 6:23 shows the punishment for sin is death, not everlasting torment. [biblehub.com](http://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm)
1.9.2.4.1.4. Con: The Bible can at best claim this, but not prove it.
1.9.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.5.3.2.
1.9.2.5. Con: Being "scientifically proven" is not a necessary requirement for being true.
1.9.2.5.1. Pro: Just because we cannot get there now and we can not observe a place does not mean it does not exist. Our galaxy is filled with places that cannot be scientifically proven. It does not mean they are not there.
1.9.2.5.1.1. Con: It doesn't mean they are there either. The burden of proof rests on the person making the claim. Otherwise anything from unicorns to elves are just as likely to exist and there is no valuable information to gain from that line of reasoning.
1.9.2.5.1.2. Con: All we know about our galaxy is from scientific observations. We cannot affirm anything beyond that. Nothing suggests that our galaxy is filled with places that cannot be scientifically proven.
1.9.2.5.2. Pro: Hell is a concept that's strongly entangled with morality, it's arguably a normative concept and not a descriptive concept, and as Hume pointed out with the is-ought distinction, you can't extract morality \( normative statements \) from scientific facts \( descriptive statements \) in any coherent or logical way. 
[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is–ought_problem)
1.9.2.5.3. Con: It is a necessary requirement for being objectively true, allow to make predictions and independently verify results.
1.9.2.5.4. Pro: The scientific method isn't the only means to truth and existence—contrary to our scientistic culture—due to its empirical limits. If it were the only means of knowing, a great many imperceptible/undetectable things would be de facto nonexistent or cognitively meaningless.
1.9.2.5.5. Con: Scientific proof is a very potent, if not the best indicator for truth.
1.9.2.5.5.1. Con: Scientific proof requires the repetition of experiments. History cannot be repeated in the manner of scientific experiments, and so scientific evidence tells us little about history, and so is not a good indicator of historical truth.
1.9.2.5.5.2. Pro: Scientific proof is the methodology that tries to remove emotional arguments from the debate and make it more objective, not subjective. If an objective metric can be found to measure the existence of Hell, it would be openly accepted.
1.9.2.5.6. Con: What is presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.
1.9.2.5.6.1. Con: 'Evidence' is ambiguous. If 'rational argument' and 'historical documents' are included in one's notion of evidence, and not merely scientific tests, then there are arguments for the existence of God who reveals truths and historical documents suggesting a God revealed that Hell exists, and arguments that those two Gods are the same. In this way, there is evidence for Hell, and so it may not be so summarily dismissed.
1.9.2.5.6.1.1. Con: The evidence is 'ambiguous' due to the essence of these 'historical documents' - Homer's Odyssey is also a 'historical document', but you would not base your world view upon it.
1.9.2.5.6.1.2. Con: Historical documents offer very weak evidence due to the subjective nature of their accuracy, especially if they are quite old and have little to offer as independent companion proof. Even in our modern times, it is quite easy for people to pass falsehoods and be believed. Examples occur in Facebook and in the "Fake News".
1.9.2.5.6.2. Con: Not all evidence is scientific evidence. To say that there is no scientific evidence for something is not the same thing as saying that there is no evidence of any kind for that thing.
1.9.2.6. Pro: If Hell existed, it would have a big impact on our lives and would be easy to detect.
1.9.2.6.1. Pro: Detectable effects of Hell's existence such as demonic possession, curses, and plagues have not been seen, thus Hell likely doesn't exist.
1.9.2.6.1.1. Con: Board certified psychiatrists have reportedly witnessed demonic possession in some of their patients.
1.9.2.6.1.1.1. Pro: Ivy League educated, board certified psychiatrist [Dr. Richard Gallagher](https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/04/health/exorcism-doctor/index.html) reportedly documented many accounts of humans displaying semonic-like behaviours that are 'beyond psychiatry.'
1.9.2.6.1.1.2. Pro: Reknown psychiatrist [M. Scott Peck](http://www.beliefnet.com/faiths/christianity/2005/01/glimpses-of-demons.aspx) wrote a book called 'Glimpses of the Devil' detailing how many patients of mental illness where helped by performing exorcisms.
1.9.2.6.1.2. Con: If Hell is the world of suffering brought about by sin, then every insistence of suffering is the essence of Hell.
1.9.2.6.1.3. Con: According to the Bible, Hell is not the place where demons come from, but the place prepared for their [punishment](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A41&version=ESV). The presence of demons would not prove Hell's existence, nor would their absence prove its non-existence.
1.9.2.6.1.3.1. Pro: Re: Hell is not where demons come from. Jude 1:6 says they are already in chains. And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling--these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day.
1.9.2.6.2. Con: Something doesn't have to be easy to detect to have an impact on individuals and society. Think about the theory on [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter), which has never been detected but is assumed to have a huge impact on the behaviour of matter in the universe.
1.9.2.6.3. Con: If Hell is, as the Bible says, a place of [future punishment](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A31-46&version=ESV), there is no reason to expect that it would have any measurable impact on our lives prior to that time.
1.9.2.6.4. Con: Mars wasn't easy to detect for centuries, yet it has always existed. That something is not easy to find does not necessarily mean that it does not exist.
1.9.2.6.5. Con: Hell is not described as something detectable, at least not  without the help of divine or angelic revelation. So we would not expect it to be easy to detect, even if it existed.
1.9.2.7. Pro: But we can use scientific observation and deduction to describe what can see in the galaxy and the universe. We cannot observe Hell to even verify that it may exist. Science cannot make any deduction on something that cannot be observed.
1.9.2.8. Con: Absence of evidence is not proof of absence. This is a very common fallacy.
1.9.2.8.1. Con: In science, a claim \(in this case, the claim that Hell exists\) is presumed to be false until sufficient evidence is found to support it.
1.10. Pro: Hell is the absence of God.
1.10.1. Con: This is a modern idea that has no basis in scripture, which depicts Hell as eternal torture in a blazing furnace. If this version of Hell is to be considered, there needs to be some basis for it in the first place.
1.10.1.1. Con: The Earth's core might suffice as the location of Hell.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: The Christian concept of Hell is not suppose to be a corporeal location.
1.10.1.1.1.1. Pro: Like Heaven, Hell is not a physical place but rather a [state of being](http://www.onenessofreligions.com/hell-physical-place/).
1.10.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: If a god is omnipresent, the absence of god is not a place but a state of being. By this definition for Hell to exist then it must be continuously be experienced by one or more beings. We cannot prove that Hell is perpetually experienced so therefore Hell cannot exist.
1.10.1.1.1.2. Con: Hell is a place with a physical place with a location.

[newadvent.org](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm)
1.10.1.1.1.2.1. Con: A physical location of Hell hasn't been pinpointed, and there is no evidence that a Hell exists under the Earth's crust.
1.10.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Hell is not on any map.
1.10.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.6.
1.10.1.2. Pro: Without the nervous system, which dies with the body, there's no reason to think that anyone would be able to feel the pain of torture in the first place.
1.10.1.2.1. Con: The resurrection is both physical and spiritual so one would be able to feel pain.
1.10.1.2.2. Con: There is more to the human experience than the materialistic worldview allows.
1.10.1.3. Pro: The basis for the Christian concept of Hell is Dante's Inferno.
1.10.1.3.1. Pro: In Dante Alighieri's 14th century poem['Divine Comedy'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_\(Dante\)), Hell is depicted as 9 concentric circles of torment on Earth. He describes it as being 'the realm of those who have rejected spiritual values by yielding to bestial appetites or violence, or by perverting their human intellect to fraud or malice against their fellowmen'
1.10.2. Con: Currently, there is no way to logically know that Hell is a place devoid of God's love.
1.10.3. Con: An eternal place of punishment is a metaphor for extreme sin and/or immorality becoming the norm everywhere and is to contrast increasing hurt versus increasing good. If divinity has any compassion then there is no place of eternal suffering.
1.10.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.
1.10.5. Con: Not everyone accepts that there is a God and that it is a loving one.
1.10.5.1. Con: Just because people don't accept it, does not mean it's not true. Some people do not accept that the world is round, for instance.
1.10.5.1.1. Con: One thing is accepting or rejecting tangible proofs of the Earth's roundness. Another thing is acceptance or rejection of the existence of supernatural entities, which is not supposed to be directly provable by the very adherents of these ideas.
1.10.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.2.
1.10.6. Con: Christian theologians say Jesus experienced the absence of God while on the cross, but that had an end. A place of perpetual torment, using the absence of God as a definition, does not exist. It was not perpetual for Jesus.
1.10.7. Con: God is in everything \([pantheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism)\). Therefore, Hell cannot exist.
1.10.8. Con: Hell is not found anywhere but in mythological scriptures and in the minds of those who believe in it.
There is no fundamental physical reason to consider Hell as something real.
1.10.8.1. Con: But given the possibility of it being real and the implications that it would bring it would be logical to side with those that do believe in it's existence and make attempts to avoid Hell.
1.10.8.2. Pro: Hell doctrines are easy to disprove using the Bible. People still believe them, though.
1.10.9. Con: This could be construed as one definition, not universally accepted.
1.10.10. Con: This idea is initially supported by scripture, but is likely impacted by considering scripture as a whole.  [Psalm 139](https://www.biblica.com/bible/niv/psalm/139/) seems to imply that there is no true escape from God's presence-- even in the realm of the dead.  Though this is referring to Sheol \(and not Gehenna\), perhaps it warrants interpreting [2 Thes. 1:8-10](https://www.biblica.com/bible/niv/2-thessalonians/1/) in an analogical \(rather than literal\) sense.  If so, this could justify the claim that Hell is not the absence of God\('s presence\) after all.
1.10.11. Con: [Rev. 14:10](http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-10.htm) does not indicate eternal separation for the condemned, but the presence of God.
1.10.11.1. Pro: Revelation 14:10 is about what is happening now, God's disapproval of those who are worshipping the beast and its image.
1.10.11.2. Con: [Revelation 22:14,15](https://www.bible.com/bible/1/REV.22.14-15.KJV) says the opposite. They will stay outside of the city where God will be
1.10.11.2.1. Con: Outside because they will be destroyed in the lake of fire where Hades will have been destroyed. "This means the second death, the lake of fire." —Revelation 20:14 [biblehub.com](https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-14.htm)
1.10.12. Con: If God is omniscient \(one of the attributes asserted in the definition of God\), there cannot be a place where God's senses do not extend.
1.10.13. Pro: To torture someone for eternity, irrespective of repentance, is not just and is evil. Therefore, it cannot exist in the presence of a loving God.
1.10.13.1. Con: Hell could be empty. So the existence of Hell does not negate the existence of a loving God in itself.
1.10.13.1.1. Pro: Hell is described as empty in [Rev. 20:5](http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-5.htm). It is empty because all have risen.
1.10.13.1.2. Con: No description of Hell has ever shown it to be empty.
1.10.13.2. Con: Humans cannot comprehend all facets of God's love. Therefore, what is judged as evil and unjust to humanity, may be considered loving in God's eye.
1.10.13.2.1. Pro: Humans cannot grasp the big picture of God's plan, thus certain actions may be wrongly judged as unjust.
1.10.13.3. Pro: A truly loving God would never say to one of his children, "I'm giving up on you forever."
1.10.13.3.1. Pro: There's no point in punishing anyone eternally since they won't be able to change their behaviour afterwards, for there is no after eternity.
1.10.13.3.1.1. Con: Punishment need not always be restorative, it could be retributive.
1.10.13.4. Pro: Punishments should be proportional to the crimes for which they were given. Since there is no way to commit an infinite crime, an infinite punishment will always be unjust.
1.10.13.4.1. Con: People could be continually sinning in Hell, and so in need of continual punishment.
1.10.13.4.2. Con: People could choose to remain in Hell despite the punishment, because the condition for exiting Hell is to serve God, and they come to hate God so much that they would rather stay in Hell for eternity than to ever serve him.
1.10.14. Con: God is said to be omnipresent, so assuming that 'absence of God' is not a figurative or analogous way of speaking, it would require that an omnipresent God does not exist.
1.10.14.1. Con: The Bible does not teach that God is omnipresent, for he is spoken of as having a location. \(1Ki 8:49; Joh 16:28; Heb 9:24\)
