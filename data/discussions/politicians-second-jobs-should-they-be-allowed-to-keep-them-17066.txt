Discussion Title: Politicians' Second Jobs: Should They be Allowed to Keep Them?

1. Politicians should be allowed no incomes except the salary they receive as members of parliament.
1.1. Pro: Being a member of parliament is a full time job. Any other employment will simply prevent politicians from doing their job properly.
1.1.1. Pro: If politicians have time to work other jobs it most likely means that they are not doing enough in their roles as elected representatives.
1.1.1.1. Pro: If a politician has free time they should use it to learn more about current issues and the problems of their constituents, not to earn extra income for themselves.
1.1.2. Pro: If many politicians held second jobs, the risk of schedule conflicts disrupting votes would be very damaging to the workings of parliament.
1.1.2.1. Pro: In 2017, Douglas Ross, a conservative MP, [missed an important vote](https://www.ft.com/content/29fde362-b42c-11e7-8007-554f9eaa90ba) in order to show up for his second job on a football team.
1.1.3. Con: Throughout history, holding public office was not a full time job.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Traditionally, members of the US Congress didn't see their job as a full time commitment. This only began to change in the [1970s](https://www.npr.org/2010/12/28/132294306/hey-congress-dont-keep-your-day-jobs), so having a full time Congress isn't necessarily needed to run a functioning governement.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Congress needed to become a full time job in order to match the research capability of the executive branch so they could make independent decisions rather than solely relying on the executive. This is crucial in keeping a check on the power of the President.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Most U.S. lawmakers in the 18th and early 19th centuries can be characterized as [“citizen legislators,”](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41545.pdf) holding full-time non-political employment and serving in Congress on a part-time basis for a short number of years.
1.1.3.3. Con: Historical examples are irrelevant when [evidence](https://www.thoughtco.com/average-number-of-legislative-days-3368250) suggests that modern politicians work at least as much as the average member of the public.
1.1.4. Con: Many politicians have personal commitments outside of their political responsibilities other than a second job, which do not prevent them from holding office properly.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Conservative MP Nadine Dorries suggested that criticism against her second job as a writer was [unfounded](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/23/twenty-mps-declare-over-100000-from-second-jobs) because she had spent years as a cook, chauffeur, and laundress for her family while holding office. These duties were not a "second job" in a technical sense, but they required her to balance her personal time with her parliamentary duties.
1.1.4.2. Con: Politicians who take second jobs likely have these personal commitments too, meaning they are even more likely to be overworked and unable to attend properly to their duties.
1.1.5. Con: The US Congress has only averaged [138](https://www.thoughtco.com/average-number-of-legislative-days-3368250) legislative days per year since 2001. This allows for plenty of time to do another job.
1.1.5.1. Con: Members of Congress work [70 hours a week](https://www.thoughtco.com/average-number-of-legislative-days-3368250) when Congress is in session, more than twice the average length of the work week for Americans. Given there are only [261](https://hr.uiowa.edu/payroll/2015-fiscal-year-payroll-calendar) working days in a year, members of Congress end up working equal to or more than the average working American.
1.1.5.2. Con: The work of Members of Congress is not limited to legislation. They also spend [substantial](https://wtop.com/news/2013/03/how-exactly-do-members-of-congress-spend-their-time/) amounts of time on administration, research, and in their constituencies, meeting with the voters whose interests they represent.
1.1.6. Con: Politicians should have the right to have a second job as long as this do not interfere with their offices.
1.1.7. Pro: There are many who do take second jobs, detracting from time spent in their constituency understanding the electorate.
1.1.7.1. Pro: In 2017, [around 200 British MPs](https://www.ft.com/content/29fde362-b42c-11e7-8007-554f9eaa90ba) had outside business interests or jobs.
1.1.7.2. Pro: British MP George Osborne held at least five other jobs, including [editor](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/17/george-osborne-named-new-evening-standard-editor-newspaper) of the Evening Standard, for which he was widely criticized.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: George Osborne increased his share of the vote in his constituency in [each](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatton_\(UK_Parliament_constituency\)#Elections) election which he contested, suggesting that his constituents felt he was doing a good job of representing their interests.
1.2. Pro: Politicians should not take limited job opportunities that would have otherwise been available to other people in need of work.
1.2.1. Pro: A Delaware state Representative was given a [second job as a receptionist in the City Council office](https://www.delawareonline.com/story/opinion/editorials/2018/01/29/stop-giving-politicians-second-jobs-editorial/1074997001/) to supplement her income, which could have been offered to someone looking to start their career.
1.2.2. Con: If a politician secures a job ahead of other candidates, it is likely because they are able to do that job well.
1.2.2.1. Con: Politicians can be seen to have an unfair advantage over regular candidates, as they are well-known public figures with a considerable degree of power.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Hiring a politician can also carry a disadvantage, as they are likely to dedicate less time to their second job and might not be as readily available as a regular candidate.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: Politicians have very specific experiences of a wide range of policy areas and sectors, which gives them an entirely fair advantage over other candidates.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Politicians' unique knowledge of the government makes them invaluable as consultants.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Politicians carrying out consulting work based on their political experience at the same time as their main careers opens the way for clear conflicts of interest.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: 'Consulting' is [often](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/31/labour-mp-barry-sheerman-first-serving-politician-registered-lobbyist) a euphemism for 'lobbying'. Politicians who take on consulting work may be unfairly giving private actors privileged access to, and influence over, the government.
1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con: [Revolving door laws](https://www.alter-eu.org/revolving-doors/faq/what-is-the-timetable-of-the-current-review-of-the-staff-regulations) exist for the purposes of regulating the outside work of politicians to ensure they are not carrying out unfair lobbying. The problem does not require a full ban on second jobs.
1.2.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Revolving door laws are often [inadequate](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/law-doesnt-end-revolving-door-on-capitol-hill/) and beset with loopholes which make lobbying easy.
1.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: Politicians working with consultancy firms may be inclined to provide those firms with unfair advantages on the basis that they expect to work for them full-time after retiring from politics.
1.3. Pro: Having multiple jobs can create a [conflict of interest](https://www.oge.gov/Web/oge.nsf/Resources/Outside+Employment+Limitations) for a politician.
1.3.1. Pro: State lawmakers around the U.S. have introduced and supported legislation that [directly and indirectly](https://www.publicintegrity.org/2017/12/26/21432/unexpected-jobs-your-state-lawmakers-have-outside-office) helped their own businesses, employers or personal finances.
1.3.2. Pro: President Trump has been criticized as having an "[unprecedented conflict of interest](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/16/donald-trumps-properties-reveal-unprecedented-conflicts-of-interest-warns-public-citizen-report.html)" for his continued business involvement during his Presidency.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Foreign state officials as well as representatives of various commercial industries have stayed at [properties related to Trump.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/16/donald-trumps-properties-reveal-unprecedented-conflicts-of-interest-warns-public-citizen-report.html)
1.3.2.2. Pro: To avoid conflicts of interest, former Presidents \(including Reagan, Bush, and Clinton\) had placed their assets in [blind trusts](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/trumps-conflict-of-interest-problem) while holding office as a way to minimize financial interests outside of their political service.
1.3.2.3. Pro: The Trump campaign directed millions of dollars in political expenses to [Trump-related business ventures](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/trumps-conflict-of-interest-problem), directly using his political activities to enrich his "second job."
1.3.2.3.1. Con: Trump's business dealings are not a 'second job'. Entirely different regulations are needed to prevent this kind of corruption, and it would be unfair to target non-corrupt politicians with second jobs in that effort.
1.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: The lack of [comprehensive regulations](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/04/16/177496734/how-congress-quietly-overhauled-its-insider-trading-law) to prevent insider trading by members of Congress presents a greater risk of corruption than members holding second jobs.
1.3.2.3.1.2. Pro: Scapegoating politicians with second jobs may divert attention from insider trading and other forms of actual corruption, making regulation of those activities less likely.
1.3.2.4. Con: For some, Trump's business success is an inextricable part of his credibility as a politician.
1.3.2.4.1. Pro: Forcing successful individuals to abandon control of their business dealings in order to be politicians could discourage them from entering politics, leading to a loss of valuable talent.
1.3.2.5. Con: Trump's business activities involve his ownership of assets, not salaried employment. As such, they would not be constrained by a regulation on 'second jobs'.
1.3.3. Pro: Even if the politician believes they are acting in integrity, the [perceived conflict of interest](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2052263014000219) can undermine their credibility and ability to govern effectively.
1.3.4. Con: Regulatory oversight like forcing them to publicly post their incomes can solve for this. What can't be solved is the income lost to the politicians' families.
1.3.4.1. Pro: MPs need to declare their financial interests, including paid employment outside Parliament, in the [Register of Members' Financial Interests](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-members-financial-interests/). If voters are choosing to remain ignorant and do not take that information into account, it's their fault, not the politicians'.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: The ways in which a politician's second job exposes him to a conflict of interest may not always be obvious to the general public or even to trained journalists. Anti-corruption regulations exist because it is unreasonable to expect citizens to serve as the corruption watchdog.
1.3.5. Con: Even if politicians didn't hold second jobs, they might still face a conflict of interest in other ways, such as through their financial holdings.
1.3.5.1. Pro: By 2016, [more than half](https://money.cnn.com/2014/11/14/investing/congress-stock-ownership/index.html) of the U.S. Congress owned stock - with some holdings at $100,000 or more.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Politicians receive [non-financial and in-kind benefits](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/us/politics/11trips.html) as a result of their service, which would not be counted as "income."
1.3.5.3. Con: The fact that there is more than one way in which a politician can experience a conflict of interest does not mean that conflicts of interests attendant upon the holding of a second job become less important.
1.3.6. Pro: Foregoing a second job can prevent politicians from being influenced by lobbying groups.
1.3.6.1. Pro: A YouGov [poll](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/02/25/voters-support-ban-second-jobs-mps/) found that 60% of UK voters believe members of Parliament taking second jobs risks conflicts of interest or corruption.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: The test of whether a given practice leads to corruption should not be a survey of public opinion, but rather an evidence-based investigation.
1.3.6.1.1.1. Con: Public faith in the integrity of politicians is necessary for the functioning of democracy. If individuals have little faith in their politicians, they are unlikely to see the point in voting or interacting with politics.
1.3.6.2. Con: Even if a politician divests themselves of their business interests, they cannot erase their previous business relationships - therefore, non-financial influence can remain.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: Similarly, the behaviour of politicians may be influenced by their expectation of taking on a job in a given industry or consulting firm after their retirement, regardless of the ban on simultaneously holding multiple jobs.
1.3.6.2.1.1. Pro: Allowing politicians to hold second jobs will make their outside interests more transparent in comparison to a circumstance where their behaviour is being influenced by their own private expectations of post-political employment.
1.3.6.2.2. Con: This policy simply has to reduce the influence of outside interests; the fact that it may be unable to eliminate those outside interests is not a reason to oppose the policy.
1.3.6.3. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.3.6.4. Con: Many of the [top recipients](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=K02++) of lobbyist money do not have second jobs.
1.3.6.5. Pro: The second jobs a politician is likely to have will often make them a member of a specific interest group, thus limiting their ability to do their job impartially.
1.3.6.5.1. Pro: Member of Legislative Assembly Donald Arseneault in Canada was hired by Canada's Building Trades Unions and his role [involved](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/taxpayers-federation-politician-job-donald-arseneault-lacey-1.4396996) lobbying the government on behalf of his employer.
1.3.6.5.2. Con: Politicians may align themselves with interest groups whose suggestions will be a benefit to all of their constituents.
1.3.6.5.2.1. Pro: Interest groups, such as those based on gender, disability, ethnic and religious identities, can suggest important checks to politicians on the powers of the majority. These suggestions by interest groups can ensure that minority constituents are represented equally as those in the majority ensuring impartiality.
1.3.6.5.3. Pro: British MP [Jack Straw](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-31587588) was caught telling a firm that he "operated under the radar" and had used his influence to change EU rules in favor of a firm he'd worked for in the past.
1.3.6.5.3.1. Con: MP's act on behalf of their constituents. Thus, if a particular law that is being argued for by an MP in Parliament contradicts the interests of their constituents, then it is the responsibility of the constituents to lobby their MP to act in accordance to their interests. Otherwise, MP's have tacit approval to act in a manner that they think benefits the interests of their constituents.
1.3.6.6. Con: When incomes are too low, politicians will look for other under the table methods of supplementing their incomes, leading to more corruption and influence from outside groups.
1.3.6.6.1. Pro: In lower income countries and smaller economies, increasing salaries of politicians [decreased the incentive to take bribes.](https://voxeu.org/article/higher-government-wages-may-reduce-corruption)
1.3.6.6.2. Con: The high salaries currently enjoyed by politicians mean that they are unlikely to need to seek under the table sources of income in the absence of second jobs.
1.3.6.6.2.1. Pro: According to one study, MPs in the EU earn [878%](https://presse.preisvergleich.de/salary-atlas-in-the-27-eu-countries-mps-earn-an-average-of-878-percent-more-than-eu-citizens/) more than the average EU citizen.
1.3.6.6.3. Con: Nigerian and Kenyan MPs have the [highest salaries](https://democracychronicles.org/comparison-politicians-pay/) relative to per capita GDP, but both countries still have high levels of [corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index), indicating that the "best" are not entering parliament, despite having high salaries.
1.3.6.6.3.1. Pro: High salaries [could](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2013/jul/01/do-higher-mps-wages-encourage-corruption) increase the likelihood of corruption by attracting those who are financially greedy to politics.
1.3.6.6.4. Con: Politicians' salaries are already too high.
1.3.6.6.4.1. Pro: Many countries' MPs get [paid](https://www.lovemoney.com/gallerylist/65052/this-is-what-mps-get-paid-in-other-countries-around-the-world) many times more than their constituencies' per capita GDP.
1.3.6.6.4.1.1. Con: Being a good politician requires a sense of responsibility for all those whose lives are impacted by the choices made. Jobs with greater human responsibility should have greater salaries.
1.3.6.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.6.2.1.
1.3.6.6.4.3. Con: Politicians have to bear an enormous responsibility to their constituents and are thus adequately compensated.
1.3.6.6.4.4. Pro: Public opinion polls indicate that people feel disconnected from their government representatives. Nevertheless, politicians continue to receive high salaries regardless of their performance, which is unjust.
1.3.6.6.4.4.1. Pro: In the US, public trust in government has reached [historic lows](http://www.people-press.org/2017/12/14/public-trust-in-government-1958-2017/) - with only 18% of Americans saying they can trust the federal government to do what is right “just about always” \(3%\) or “most of the time” \(15%\).
1.3.6.6.4.4.2. Con: It would be difficult or even impossible to tie politicians' compensation to their performance.
1.3.6.6.4.4.2.1. Pro: Approval ratings for any given representative are likely to vary depending on the voters' party affiliations - there is no consistent standard for "good performance."
1.3.6.6.4.4.2.2. Pro: The policies which a politician supports often take years or decades to come into fruition, at which point they may no longer hold government office.
1.3.6.6.4.5. Con: Running for office might mean a [significant paycut](https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2013/07/16/can-you-afford-to-be-a-politician) for otherwise committed and highly qualified professionals. Allowing these candidates to earn extra income means that the best people are not discouraged from entering politics.
1.3.6.6.4.6. Con: Politicians having access to alternative income from a second job could facilitate a reduction in parliamentary salaries, which would save the public money.
1.3.6.6.4.6.1. Con: We cannot expect everyone who wants to become a politician to take on multiple jobs. Doing so would significantly narrow the pool of willing candidates and therefore influence the political landscape of the country as well.
1.3.6.6.4.6.2. Con: Politicians have had second jobs for a long time at this point and there hasn't been a significant push to lower salaries.
1.3.6.6.4.6.3. Con: Politicians are not likely to vote on their own salary reductions because it would be detrimental to them. So there isn't a way to get any bills related to pay cuts on the docket.
1.3.6.6.4.6.3.1. Con: In many countries, the salaries of politicians are set by [independent bodies](http://www.theipsa.org.uk/about-us/who-we-are/) rather than the politicians themselves.
1.3.6.6.4.7. Pro: The gross economic [disparities](https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/ed-jones/these-figures-show-how-out-of-touch-uk-politicians-are-from-everyone-else) between politicians and the average person are likely to lead to politicians failing to understand important issues facing the populace, such as lack of access to education or the cost of childcare.
1.3.6.6.4.7.1. Con: Spending time in a conventional workplace may give politicians additional insight into important issues which impact ordinary people such as workplace rights and parental leave.
1.3.6.6.4.7.1.1. Con: Workplaces have departments run by qualified workers that oversee these matters. A politician can simply liaise with these departments in order to gain additional insights, rather than having to work for them.
1.3.6.6.4.7.1.2. Con: Most politicians have access to a variety of [research services](https://www.parliamentaryresearch.com/) through their party or staff which they can make use of in order to gain insight into these issues.
1.3.6.6.4.8. Pro: The average [base salary of US politicians](https://www.thoughtco.com/how-much-do-politicians-earn-3367616) in both the Senate and the House of Representatives is 174,000 dollars a year, while the [average American earns](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-census-median-income-2017-9) 59,039 dollars.
1.3.7. Con: Since many politicians have conflict of interest despite not having a second job, allowing them to have could lead to better monitoring politicians external activities.
1.4. Con: Given how salaries of members of parliaments are often not very high, this would discourage the best from entering parliament.
1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.6.4.
1.4.2. Pro: Not being able to earn an extra income might force people who want to start families out of the job.
1.4.3. Pro: This would prevent people from low income backgrounds from running, causing a disconnect between the politicians and the people they represent.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Politicians in the US tried [living off of the minimum wage](http://time.com/3049371/politicians-minimum-wage/) in their state for a week. All of them failed because they live in a bubble vastly different from the people they represent.
1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.3.6.6.3.
1.5. Con: In a world where more opportunities are available to people than before, more people aspire to work for more than one employer. Politicians are people, therefore they should have the right to do it.
1.5.1. Con: According to [Gallup polls](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236474/millennials-job-hopping-generation.aspx) on the state of the workforce, 60% of millennial employees say they are open to taking a new job opportunity, and 20% report switching jobs within the last year. However, these statistics and aspirations do not mean politicians should also view their role as transient or have the right to quit unexpectedly.
1.5.2. Con: It is more likely that people work multiple jobs because they are [forced to do so](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2014/12/14/the-devalued-american-worker/) [to make ends meet](https://www.businessinsider.com/more-americans-working-more-than-one-job-to-make-ends-meet-2017-8).
1.5.3. Pro: Members of parliament should follow the same rules that apply to most people. If most people have two jobs, then it makes sense to apply it to members too.
1.5.3.1. Con: The [vast](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/multiple-jobholding-over-the-past-two-decades-1.htm) majority of people do not have multiple jobs.
1.5.3.2. Con: Some job contracts have exclusivity requirements or non-compete clauses, depending on the job description. It is reasonable to think that serving in a job similar to an MP could require an exclusive commitment.
1.5.3.3. Con: If an employer believes that a second job impacts the quality of the work of their employees, the employer has every right to question the dedication of the employee. A job of high responsibility representing between [60,000 to 85,000](https://www.politico.eu/article/india-no-rush-to-do-bilateral-trade-deal-with-post-brexit-britain-commonwealth-eu-customs-union-external-tariffs/) constituents and the best interests of the country should not be part-time.
1.5.4. Con: Members of parliament aren't like most people. They were given a position of power to be representatives of their constituents. They lose a level of privacy, freedom of speech, etc. because they speak on behalf of many people. This should be another right they lose as a result of choosing this job.
1.6. Con: Politicians often need a second income to meet the needs of their household.
1.6.1. Pro: In the U.S., [only 10 of 50 states](https://www.publicintegrity.org/2017/12/26/21432/unexpected-jobs-your-state-lawmakers-have-outside-office) pay legislators enough to make a living, according to a 2017 report by the National Conference of State Legislatures.
1.6.1.1. Pro: In 2017, average compensation for a state legislator in Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Wyoming was [less than $20,000](http://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/full-and-part-time-legislatures.aspx), which is under the poverty line for a [household of three](https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines).
1.6.2. Pro: When a politician eventually leaves office, they may be at a disadvantage in the private sector job market. Having a second job while in office ensures they will be prepared for retirement from public service.
1.6.2.1. Con: Upon retirement, many politicians receive well-paying jobs [as political consultants](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/05/lobbying-the-job-of-choice-for-retired-members-of-congress/558851/).
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: Between a quarter and a sixth of members of Congress become [lobbyists](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/05/lobbying-the-job-of-choice-for-retired-members-of-congress/558851/) after leaving office.
1.6.2.1.2. Pro: Politicians frequently receive [lucrative appointments to corporate boards](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/02/01/how-and-why-retired-politicians-get-lucrative-appointments-on-corporate-boards/?utm_term=.40538ba8c9c2) after leaving office.
1.6.2.2. Con: -> See 1.6.2.1.2.
1.6.3. Pro: Running for office [can be incredibly expensive](https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2013/07/16/can-you-afford-to-be-a-politician). Very little funding is provided publicly so most campaigns are funded out of the pocket of the person running. A second income would mean more people can remain financially stable while running for office.
1.6.3.1. Con: Most [campaign financing](https://www.thoughtco.com/who-funds-political-campaigns-3367629) comes from individual donors, special interest groups, and political action committees.
1.6.4. Con: -> See 1.3.6.6.4.5.
1.6.5. Pro: Being a politician can be stressful enough given the many responsibilities that come with holding political office. The added stress of struggling to fulfill the needs of their family can compromise a politician's ability to represent constituents effectively.
1.6.6. Con: -> See 1.3.6.6.4.
1.7. Con: Politicians can provide helpful services to their communities in the capacity of their second jobs.
1.7.1. Con: Being a politician is a position of enormous influence relative to the average person. These politicians could likely achieve more net good by devoting extra energy to their political work.
1.7.2. Con: 'Helpful service' is relative - the best thing a politician can do is actively engage with their constituencies and represent their interests in Parliament, which might be impaired if said politican's attention is divided between multiple jobs.
1.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.7.4. Pro: Several British MPs [work](https://fullfact.org/law/are-mps-allowed-second-jobs/) in the medical field as nurses and doctors.
1.7.5. Pro: MP Douglas Ross works as an [assistant referee](https://fullfact.org/law/are-mps-allowed-second-jobs/) for the Scottish Football Association.
1.7.6. Con: Politicians are unlikely to have the [comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage) in their second job, therefore they should focus solely on public administration.
1.7.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.7.6.2. Con: People are generally allowed to pursue a career of their choice regardless of whether or not they enjoy comparative advantage at a given job. Politicians are just as entitled to make this choice.
1.7.7. Con: Politicians often [take higher paying second jobs](https://billypenn.com/2016/05/31/city-council-side-jobs-all-the-totally-legal-ways-phillys-electeds-supplement-income/) to supplement their original incomes. This would pull them to higher paying consulting groups or other private sector jobs, rather than nonprofits or more community based work.
1.8. Con: Having a job outside parliament provides valuable experience that a member of parliament can use in their political life, preventing them from having an exclusively political view.
1.8.1. Con: Politicians constantly legislate on issues of which they have no firsthand or personal experience.
1.8.1.1. Pro: White, male politicians frequently vote on legislation regarding the rights of women and ethnic minorities.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Politicians vote on foreign policy issues regarding the use of military force, but are not required to have served in the army to do so.
1.8.2. Pro: Having a second job allows MPs to directly interact with members of their constituencies.
1.8.2.1. Con: The pool of people politicians can interact with through their second jobs is much narrower than it would be if they dedicated that time to meaningful engagement with constituents.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: In most jobs, the employee interfaces with a relatively homogenous group of people \(i.e., the same types of clients from the same geographic area or economic class\). In contrast, politicians have a mandate to diversify the kinds of people they meet.
1.8.2.1.2. Pro: Not working a second job means that politicians have more time to meet with constituents and learn about their wide range of experiences.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Politicians working in a blue-collar second-job may have insights into the community which they would otherwise not see in the course of their official duties.
1.8.2.2.1. Pro: Arkansas state representative Stephen Meeks says he witnesses [rare glimpses into people's lives](https://www.publicintegrity.org/2017/12/26/21432/unexpected-jobs-your-state-lawmakers-have-outside-office) in his second job as a pizza delivery man.
1.8.2.2.2. Con: Given the [high salaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaries_of_members_of_the_United_States_Congress) of politicians, the number of them who will consider it worthwhile to take a blue-collar second job is low.
1.8.2.3. Con: MP's directly interact with members of their constituency by attending local events, holding [advice surgeries](https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/assets/0003/8416/Meet_your_MP_guide.pdf) or at their constituency office by appointment. Therefore, having a second job is an unnecessary requirement for politicians to directly interact with members of their constituency.
1.8.2.4. Con: MPs with additional jobs very often do not actually work in their [constituencies](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/5663446/MPs-second-jobs-revealed.html).
1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.6.4.7.1.
1.8.4. Con: -> See 1.3.6.5.
1.8.5. Con: A large amount of politicians have [different jobs](https://www.thoughtco.com/members-of-congress-by-former-professions-3368253) prior to entering politics. This means that they have the past experience of working outside jobs while being able to focus completely on their political work.
1.8.5.1. Con: Some politicians are in office for [decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_of_members_of_parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom#Longest). As time goes by, they may become increasingly distant from their previous work and exposure to the non-political sphere of life.
1.8.5.1.1. Con: Politicians are likely to always remember core experiences of being employed in the regular economy, and to be able to incorporate those experiences into their political work.
1.8.5.1.2. Pro: The economy is constantly transforming in ways which may render the experiences of politicians who worked regular jobs early in their careers irrelevant.
1.8.5.1.2.1. Pro: Recent years have seen the rise of [automation](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ch/Documents/innovation/ch-en-innovation-automation-report.pdf) in the workforce, threatening many traditional jobs.
1.8.5.1.2.2. Pro: Informal or less secure employment practices such as [freelancing](https://www.upwork.com/press/2017/10/17/freelancing-in-america-2017/) are increasingly the norm for younger workers.
1.8.5.1.3. Pro: Having worked outside of politics makes it [more likely](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44675842) a person will not be a career politician, because they have a broader range of experiences and career options.
1.8.5.1.4. Pro: [More than 110](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_United_States_Congress_by_longevity_of_service) U.S. Congressmen and women have served more than 35 years in office.
1.8.5.1.5. Con: Term limits could prevent people from holding office for long periods of time.
1.8.5.1.5.1. Con: Term limits would mean that politicians are able to gain less experience of governing, potentially leading to lower-quality political leadership.
1.8.5.1.6. Pro: Winston Churchill was an MP for more than [60 years.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_of_members_of_parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom#Longest)
1.8.6. Con: Politicians still interact with a variety of workers and people in "normal life" settings, even if the politician themself is not employed.
1.8.6.1. Pro: By virtue of how many people they meet, politicians hear stories from more people in more varied professions than they could possibly experience first-hand in a job.
1.8.6.2. Con: Interacting with employees as a customer does not provide the same insights as having their job. A politician might frequently eat in restaurants, but that doesn't mean they will understand the difficulties of long hours in the service industry.
1.8.6.2.1. Con: It is unrealistic to expect politicians to have first-hand experience of all jobs and industries. One does not have to work in a certain job to grasp the hardships involved in it.
1.8.6.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.
