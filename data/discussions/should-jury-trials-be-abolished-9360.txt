Discussion Title: Should jury trials be abolished?

1. Jury trials should be abolished.
1.1. Con: Judges are more likely to reach unfair outcomes than juries.
1.1.1. Pro: Judges are easier to influence and bribe than 12 citizens selected from a large pool of people.
1.1.1.1. Con: In countries with well-functioning judicial systems, it is very hard to directly bribe judges.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: According to a [Transparency International study](http://pennsylvaniacourtwatch.com/research/judicial-corruption-yale-university-research/), in the US and Canada, countries that have well-developed judicial systems and value the rule of law, 2% of people in the court system in the past year have paid bribes. That translates into more than one million bribes in the US, including some paid to judges.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This statistic includes bribes to police and prosecutors, as well as judges, thus it is not an effective indication of judicial corruption.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Nevertheless, bribes paid to judges are included in the statistic. The integrity of judges is crucial to a just court system, so any indication of corruption should be concerning.
1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Bribes may be more likely to be paid early in the judicial process \(i.e., to police and prosecutors\) because it is easier and cheaper to get a police officer to walk away or a prosecutor to drop a case, than to convince a judge to rule fraudulently.
1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Judges are likely more difficult to bribe because they typically receive [higher salaries](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-compensation) than police officers and prosecutors.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Altogether, research indicated that some 2.5 million bribes are paid each year within the U.S. Justice System \(which is generally considered to lack systemic bribery/corruption\), according to [Pew Research, Yale Law School, and other sources](https://www.seeker.com/how-corrupt-is-americas-judicial-system-1792674447.html).
1.1.1.2. Pro: In 2018, a Texas judge was [arrested](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/texas-judge-arrested-and-charged-bribery) for taking bribes from an attorney. From the attorney's perspective, it would have been riskier to attempt to bribe every jury they interacted with.
1.1.1.3. Pro: People [trust judges](https://www.indy100.com/article/trust-in-almost-all-occupations-is-fading-especially-for-journalists-and-politicians--W1lI3R1xbue) to be unbiased and impartial, therefore their rulings are [not often questioned](https://www.seeker.com/how-corrupt-is-americas-judicial-system-1792674447.html).
1.1.1.4. Con: Using panels of 3 judges to preside together over every case can curb the problem of undue influence over any one judge enormously.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: Many countries already experience [underfunded and understaffed](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/mar/01/courts-are-running-out-of-qualified-judges-peers-are-told) judicial systems. Requiring that three judges preside over a case means that far fewer cases can be seen, delaying justice.
1.1.1.5. Con: Most judges earn over [$200 000.00](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-compensation), which would make them much harder to bribe than the average jury member.
1.1.1.6. Pro: Judges who preside over a large number of similar cases can be corrupted by institutional interests related to their field of law.
1.1.1.6.1. Pro: In 2008, two US judges pled guilty to accepting [millions in bribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_for_cash_scandal) from a private youth detention facility in exchange for harsher sentences on juveniles appearing in their courts.
1.1.2. Con: It's easier to check for bias if you are looking through one person's history rather than twelve. With juries it is much more likely that a biased juror influences the rest, whereas with a judge, if they have a biased history, it could warrant taking them off the case.
1.1.2.1. Con: In Brazil, the judge himself decides if he/she is unfit for judging, which leads to some midiatic cases like [a judge from the superior court judging the father of his best man, conceding him three consecutive habeas corpus.](https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/gilmar-mendes-manda-soltar-jacob-barata-filho-e-lelis-teixeira.ghtml)
1.1.3. Con: Judges have the training and expertise to better understand complex law.
1.1.3.1. Con: Judgeships do not require any expertise since many judges are appointed through elections which are open to anybody.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Even if this is true, it would be much easier to enact policies to train all judges up to a standard where they can understand complex legal issues than it would be to train all potential jurors to the same standard. There are much fewer judges than potential jurors.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: 28 states [require](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/when-your-judge-isnt-a-lawyer/515568/) that judges are lawyers.
1.1.3.1.3. Con: Non-lawyer judges may only hand out sentences of up to six months, and may have their sentences [appealed](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/when-your-judge-isnt-a-lawyer/515568/).
1.1.3.1.4. Con: The public is unlikely to elect someone who they do not think can effectively discharge the duties of the role. Non-lawyer judges are rare and only elected when the public thinks they are best for the role.
1.1.3.2. Con: Juries represent the ultimate "reasonable person test" -- how would a reasonable layman interpret and understand a particular law? That perspective is important in deciding matters of justice, and judges may sometimes be "overeducated/overqualified" and too rigid to allow for this crucial perspective.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Laws often have to be interpreted, and having legal training makes one better qualified to do this.
1.1.3.4. Con: We have had, especially in the last two decades, an ever increasing number of Activist Judges. These are judges who rule by what they want the law to say and not by what the law actually says. This is the biggest threat to our justice system and to democracy. This bypasses legislators, public input, the value of a vote and the rule of law.
1.1.3.5. Pro: Judges are cognizant of legal precedents and thus, more aware of the nuances in a case. Juries are less likely to be familiar with prior instances of the case and more likely to be biased by their preferred media outlets. Since judges are aware of prior arguments in similar cases, they can be more discerning in spite of their ideology.
1.1.3.6. Pro: Not only do Judges have more expertise in the law, they also have a better understand of what the standard for "proof beyond a reasonable doubt" actually is.
1.1.3.7. Con: Judges should give the facts required for a conviction, the reading of the law\(s\) and what's to be proven and not a discourse unrelated to the charges as often happens. In many cases no convicting facts are proven, charging judges don't read the laws nor what is required to be proven is presented yet people are found guilty. When We The People chosen are educated and know - see [hubpages.com](https://hubpages.com/politics/The-U-S-Constitutions-Spirit) - judges are to be the opposite of what I presented Jury trials should be maintained.
1.1.3.8. Pro: Jurors are generally ill informed on any specific issue, and may make worse judgements over the facts than experts in the subject matter.
1.1.3.9. Con: Judges can [advise jurors](https://www.lawhandbook.sa.gov.au/ch13s03s06s01.php) as to what the law is whenever the jury has questions.
1.1.3.9.1. Con: Studies [have found](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/feb/17/jurors-judges-legal-advice-report) that jurors often misunderstand the legal advice of judges.
1.1.3.9.2. Con: Judges are often not allowed to give useful explanations beyond using the legal terminology. In examples, such as [this survey](https://www.ruleoflaw.org.au/beyond-reasonable-doubt/), it has lead to jurors having different understandings of what is meant by terms such as 'beyond reasonable doubt'.
1.1.3.10. Pro: Many cases, such as those involving financial crime, are too [complex](http://forumonpublicpolicy.com/archive06/ward.pdf) for juries to fully understand. Therefore, their decisions cannot be trusted.
1.1.3.10.1. Con: Specially selected [expert juries](https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/politics/dpp-white-collar-criminal-trials-may-need-expert-juries-120013.html) can be used for certain crimes.
1.1.3.11. Con: Judges can become jaded and inattentive after having tried thousands of cases in their career.
1.1.3.11.1. Con: Judges are professionals who have chosen to spend a career watching court cases, so they are less likely to be inattentive than jurors who might be uninterested in the case.
1.1.3.11.2. Pro: A juror sees just one case and is more likely to judge it on its own merits.
1.1.3.11.3. Con: Judges who try many cases can be held to account based on patterns of incompetence or bias. No such mechanism exists for juries who try a single case.
1.1.4. Pro: Judges' verdicts are often influenced by politics.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Judges may reach certain verdicts in an attempt to be re-elected rather than to serve justice.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: It is extremely problematic to have such a politicised environment around judges. If they have to rely on being re-elected, they are far more likely to cater their decisions towards the biggest blocks of voters, which may mean leaning towards more liberal or more conservative decisions than are reasonable.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Judges have a strong incentive to appear strong on crime in order to be re-elected.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Trial judges impose the death sentence [more frequently](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/How_Judicial_Elections_Impact_Criminal_Cases.pdf) during election years.
1.1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Appointed judges [reversed](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/How_Judicial_Elections_Impact_Criminal_Cases.pdf) death sentences at a much higher rate than elected judges, and more than double the rate of judges facing competitive elections.
1.1.4.1.2.3. Pro: In states where judges are elected, the likelihood of a judge affirming a death sentence were [directly correlated](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/How_Judicial_Elections_Impact_Criminal_Cases.pdf) with the local rate of approval for the death sentence.
1.1.4.1.2.4. Pro: Trial judges in Pennsylvania and Washington sentenced defendants to [longer](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/How_Judicial_Elections_Impact_Criminal_Cases.pdf) sentences the closer they got to an election.
1.1.4.1.2.5. Pro: Supreme court justices are far [less](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/How_Judicial_Elections_Impact_Criminal_Cases.pdf) likely to rule in favour of criminal defendants in the year before an election.
1.1.4.1.2.6. Con: If this reflects the views of the public on how crime ought to be handled, this is a good thing.
1.1.4.1.2.7. Con: It's far more likely that they will want to approach crime in line with public opinion, whether that's strong or weak on crime. In any case, they rarely need to worry since judges are almost universally re-elected regardless of their performance.
1.1.4.1.3. Con: While that it is true, there's little evidence that they need to since they are almost always re-elected anyway.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Judges who are appointed by legislatures, such as those in [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_appointments_in_Canada), are likely to reflect the political views of those in that legislature.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Judges tend to serve long terms. This means they may effectively advance a political agenda no longer supported by the public.
1.1.4.2.1.1. Con: Jury trials help in faster disposal of cases via quick hearings and helps in having lessor backlog in the Judicial system.
1.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.6.
1.1.4.4. Con: While this may sometimes be true, there is little evidence to suggest that juries aren't at least as influenced by politics as judges.
1.1.5. Con: Laws tend to be unfair. For example, it is unfair that people serve long sentences for minor crimes, but sometimes that is the law. However, it is better for judges to make decisions based on the law rather than 12 people making decisions based on subjective conceptions of fairness.
1.1.6. Pro: 12 randomly selected jurors are necessarily more representative of the general population than a single judge,[who is likely to be white and privileged](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43426.pdf).
1.1.6.1. Con: The law is not a matter of being "representative of the general population." Justice is not democracy. Justice and law are the application of usually complex legal codes to complex situations, while keeping emotion and prejudice out of it. A judge \(a professional juror, trained in ways to avoid prejudice and liable to be held accountable for every judgement he makes by his peers through the appeals system\) will be much more likely to achieve this than 12 laymen.
1.1.6.2. Con: Jury selection can be biased against minorities, preventing them from participating equally in the justice system.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Studies in the US [have shown](https://today.duke.edu/2012/04/jurystudy) that all-white juries are disproportionately more likely to convict black defendants than juries including a black person.
1.1.6.2.2. Pro: The US has had many [instances](https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2015/11/timothy-foster-supreme-court-smoking-gun-black-jurors/) of prosecutors removing black jurors from juries on the basis of their race.
1.1.6.2.3. Con: If the justice system in a particular area is sufficiently prejudiced to allow prosecutors to do this, then the judges in that system are probably prejudiced as well and would not offer a large improvement over even rigged juries.
1.1.6.2.4. Con: If jury selection is properly moderated and overseen, prosecutors should be unable to do this.
1.1.6.2.5. Pro: Ethnic minorities are [underrepresented](http://www.flinders.edu.au/ehl/fms/law_files/staff/pdf/EthnicBias.pdf) on juries in Australia and New Zealand, partially as a result of discriminatory challenges by prosecutors.
1.1.6.3. Con: According to [US statistics](https://www.statista.com/statistics/408483/percentage-of-us-district-court-judges-by-race/) \(at least as far as district courts go\) it looks as if the number of judges fall almost exactly on the lines of our national demographics.
1.1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.1.8. Pro: Judges are elitists by definition.
1.1.9. Con: Potential jurors are intentionally screened out by prosecutors and defense prior to trial, leading to a biased jury.
1.1.10. Con: According the U.S. Constitution's Art. 3, sec 1, Judges are to be circumspect both on and off the bench which require them to be objective when decision making. If they were without biases and constitutionally conscious it would be less costly therefore,  constitutional judges should try all cases except for murder and sexual behavior trials.
1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.3. Con: Juries provide a valuable check and balance against the power of the government.
1.3.1. Pro: Jury Nullification - when the jury finds a defendant not guilty, despite the evidence, is an important check against the government and unjust laws.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Jury Nullification was used by juries to prevent the [conviction](http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2010/02/10/the-untold-history-of-nullification/) of fugitive slaves.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Jury Nullification was also used by juries to [prevent](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-01-27/opinion/ct-jury-nullification-edit-0127-20140127_1_jury-nullification-law-professor-jurors) the [conviction](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-death-of-emmett-till) of lynch mob members.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Jury Nullification was used by juries to prevent the [conviction](https://openjurist.org/417/f2d/1002/united-states-v-moylan) of Vietnam War protesters and draft dodgers.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Jury Nullification was used to protect Free Speech and freedom of association when juries refused to [convict](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/249us211) union members and labor organisers.
1.3.1.4. Pro: Jury Nullification was used by juries to prevent the [conviction](https://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/04/08/history-is-clear-juries-were-supposed-to-be-able-to-overturn-laws/?utm_term=.fbe244304325&httpsredir=1&article=1671&context=hlr) of those who violated the Volstead Act, and thus brought about the end of prohibition.
1.3.1.5. Con: Patently unjust laws should be addressed and rectified through democratic means involving everybody, not through the ad hoc say-so of a random group of 12 laymen.
1.3.1.6. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.
1.3.1.7. Con: Jury nullification is unjust because it requires jurors to violate the oath they take at the beginning of the case to consider only the evidence presented and the instructions of the trial judge.
1.3.1.8. Pro: The right to jury nullification [exists](https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/06/jury-nullification), though there are some barriers to exercising it.
1.3.2. Pro: The jury system puts a greater burden of proof on the State to prove your guilt. They must convince 12 non-government individuals rather than one other government representative.
1.3.3. Pro: Jury trials are your right to have non-governmental actors involved and you can waive it for a bench trial if you want.
1.3.4. Pro: We should not abolish juries for the same reason you don't abolish plebiscites: it is a bulwark against tyranny.
1.3.5. Con: Most juries are composed of less qualified or educated individuals than judges and lawyers. Their opinions can be easily swayed by rhetoric and are bored by the nuances of the law that actually matter in a trial. Their check against the government is functionally arbitrary.
1.3.6. Con: Most countries have rigorous systems to ensure that judges remain independent of the government, so juries are not necessarily better at checking the power of government.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Unlike juries, judges have the power to make law under [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law) jurisdictions, so they can more actively check government power.
1.3.7. Pro: Juries ensure that laws remain reasonable and reflect the opinion of society in general.
1.3.7.1. Con: That usually does more harm than good. The general opinions of society tend to be biased and misinformed. That should not be reflected in the justice system.
1.3.7.2. Pro: Criminal law is meant to be a codification of the values and principles of society.
1.3.7.3. Con: Juries have nothing to do with the law. They are supposed to determine if a law was violated or not, or rather if the State proved that it was.
1.3.7.3.1. Con: Juries are one of the main organs of the justice system. They ensure the law is applied in as much an unbiased way as possible. Therefore juries have everything to do with the law.
1.3.7.4. Con: The small sample size of jurors \(usually 12\) means it cannot hope to provide a true reflection of the views of the community, and so is ineffective in representing “the people”.
1.4. Con: Juries increase the legitimacy of the criminal justice system in the eye of the public by including them in trial processes.
1.4.1. Pro: Juries inject a "community norm" into the process which helps maintain a necessary connection between the body politic and the adjudicative element of the Judicial Branch.
1.4.2. Pro: As a compulsory civic duty, jury service serves an role in promoting community values and collectivism within all citizens, whom otherwise may just focus on their individual rights and goals.
1.4.3. Pro: If the judicial system is not perceived as legitimate, their rulings may not be respected or followed by people or other branches of government.
1.4.3.1. Pro: The judiciary does not have the power to enforce its rulings \(especially in the criminal justice system\) without cooperation from the other branches of government.
1.4.3.2. Pro: The judicial branch often rules contrary to the actions of other branches of government, therefore it is especially vulnerable to becoming powerless if the public does not trust its legitimacy.
1.4.4. Pro: In a democracy, "accountability and the consent of the governed form the most common source of [institutional legitimacy](http://mjnelson.wustl.edu/papers/AnnualReview.pdf)."
1.4.5. Pro: The judiciary is mostly comprised of officials who are not elected, making them vulnerable to accusations that they are too far removed from the people's wishes. Juries can help remedy this by providing direct involvement.
1.4.6. Con: The system should not prioritize the wishes of the public, if juries produce problematic rulings or unjust outcomes.
1.4.6.1. Con: A judge still has the power to overturn a jury, change a sentence or deliver a directed verdict, in cases where the law is clear and the jury has not voted in accordance with the law.
1.4.7. Con: Most people hope to avoid being chosen for jury duty, therefore, their personal participation is not necessary for a belief in judicial legitimacy.
1.4.8. Pro: Without jury trials, most people's knowledge of the justice system would be based on film and television. Inclusion of the public is essential in educating people about how courts actually function.
1.4.8.1. Pro: Voters cannot be expected to make decisions about how the criminal justice system should function if they do not understand it.
1.4.8.2. Con: Just [0.02%](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-are-the-chances-of-serving-on-a-jury/) of U.S. adults serve in a jury trial in a given year. A proportion of people this tiny does not have a meaningful effect on the the public's knowledge of justice.
1.4.8.2.1. Con: Even if the number is small, those who serve in a jury communicate with friends and family about their experience and spread knowledge of the justice system throughout society.
1.4.8.2.2. Pro: This is because the number of adults functionally eligible for jury duty is far smaller than the total adult population. Jurors must be fully proficient in the native language of their country, be a citizen, have no disqualifying health condition and must not have been convicted of a [felony.](http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/jury-service/juror-qualifications)
1.4.9. Con: Flawed juries mean that the law is inconsistently and unjustly applied. This reduces public faith in the justice system.
1.5. Con: Juries have the ability to find individuals not guilty when they think the law is wrong or that the punishment would be unfair.
1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.5.2. Pro: Judges, who have to provide legal reasoning for their decisions, are not in a position to be able to take these factors into consideration when determining guilt.
1.5.2.1. Con: As juries do not have to provide reasons for their decisions, the transparency and quality of the court system are harmed.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: [This is changing in many places](https://www.npr.org/2017/03/06/518877248/supreme-court-allows-prying-into-jury-deliberations-if-racism-is-perceived). The Supreme Court of the US recently ruled that, when there is evidence of racism during jury deliberations, the judge can violate their secrecy to make sure the defendant got a fair trial.
1.5.2.1.2. Con: Judges don't have to provide logical, supportable reasons for their decisions.   Take, for example, the affluenza case  -- the judge accepted a ridiculous 'malady' made up by the defendant's legal team.   There was no precedent or solid argument for him doing so, nor any reason to assume a jury wouldn't have done as well or better.  A link on the "affluenza" case \([dailymail.co.uk](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3458754/No-regrets-Texas-judge-sentenced-affluenza-teen-Ethan-Couch-slap-wrist-punishment-killing-FOUR-people-drunk-driving-crash-says-facts.html)\) and a proposal to impeach the judge [change.org](https://www.change.org/p/texas-house-of-representatives-and-senate-impeach-and-remove-district-judge-jean-boyd-for-rich-texas-teen-s-lenient-sentence)
1.5.2.1.3. Pro: Convicted defendants are more likely to feel alienation from the justice system if no explanation is given for their conviction.
1.5.2.1.3.1. Pro: This is particularly harmful for the rehabilitative purpose of the criminal justice system. If people do not know the exact reasoning for their verdict, they assume it's all arbitrary, feel as though the system messed up and not them, and never really repent of their actions.
1.5.2.1.4. Pro: In cases where prominent defendants are controversially acquitted or convicted, it is crucial that the public is informed about why the decision was made.
1.5.2.1.4.1. Con: The vast majority of trials receive no public attention. Jury trials can be abolished in cases of a high profile and maintained for all others.
1.5.2.1.5. Con: Juries force lawyers to speak in clear understandable language instead of legal jargon. This ensures the justice system remains transparent and accessible to defendants and the wider public.
1.5.2.1.6. Con: A court case involves the presentation of arguments for both sides. Juries are not allowed to decide based on evidence or arguments that were not presented. Therefore, the reasoning for a verdict is clear based on what was presented by the winning side.
1.5.3. Pro: Jury's offer a human counterweight to the rational process of law. In cases where the accused felony conflicts with the human factor behind the crime a jury can decide to declare the offender not guilty based upon "fairness". Take for example a father who kills the raper of his daughter. Is it right to convict the father for murder? A jury might decide not to, cause the father was under influence of strong emotions and it should be manslaughter.
1.5.4. Con: It is wrong for 12 randomly selected individuals to override laws decided upon by democratically elected legislatures.
1.5.4.1. Con: Juries are still democratic in the sense that they're a randomly selected portion of the population, so they represent the population in a way comparable to democratic elections.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: 12 people is too small of a sample to be reliably representative of the wider population.
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: Elections are simply a way to approximately estimate the underlying preferences and beliefs of the populations; juries can serve the same purpose.
1.5.4.1.3. Con: Jurors may be randomly selected, but the prosecutor and defence select which jurors may serve on any particular trial.
1.5.4.2. Con: The judicial system in the US already allows for elements of the judiciary to override democratically determined legislation.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: [Judicial review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review_in_the_United_States) gives judges in the US the power to strike down laws that interfere with the Constitution.
1.5.4.2.1.1. Con: The judiciary may only strike down laws that interfere with the constitution, juries may nullify constitutional but nonetheless unfair laws.
1.5.4.3. Con: It is legal for juries to vote not guilty for this reason. It is not an override of these laws.
1.5.4.4. Con: -> See 1.3.1.
1.5.4.5. Pro: Jurors have been arbitrarily elevated to a position of power for a specific purpose. They cannot legitimately impose their will on the rest of the population.
1.5.5. Pro: There are cases where even though legally someone may have committed a crime, mitigating circumstances mean it would be wrong to punish them as criminals, and it is valuable that juries can therefore choose to acquit them.
1.5.5.1. Con: If mitigating circumstances are often relevant in determining punishment, then they should be incorporated into the law through democratic mechanisms, rather than left to the decisions of juries.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: Legislation cannot capture or foresee the nuances of every specific case. Juries are in a position to do so.
1.5.5.2. Pro: A jury in New Zealand took only 47 minutes to [acquit a father](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/faces-of-innocents/80034909/Faces-of-Innocents-The-killer-a-jury-wouldn-t-convict) who killed his baby daughter after she was diagnosed with a condition that meant her brain would never develop beyond that of a 13 week old fetus.
1.5.5.3. Con: Judges are empowered to reduce the severity of a sentence based on mitigating [circumstances.](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/aggravating-circumstances-sentencing.html)
1.6. Con: The right to a fair trial and judgement by a jury of your peers \(your peers, not a single individual above you or them\) is one of the cornerstones of most modern legal systems in most modern democracies.
1.7. Con: Juries are more likely to cancel out bias because they are made up of 12 people who have to reach a unanimous decision.
1.7.1. Con: The same effect is already achieved \(without need of a jury\) by the appeals system. By the time a case runs out of appeals, a significant number of judges have already handled the case and agreed about the correct verdict. No jury is required to cancel out bias.
1.7.1.1. Con: Appealing a decision can be both expensive and time consuming, which means it may not be an option for all accused, and should not have to be in order to avoid bias.
1.7.1.2. Con: Just because judges agree, doesn't mean they are right.
1.7.1.3. Con: Repeated appeals are incredibly inefficient for the justice system as a whole, since they require many times the amount of resources that a single jury case consumes.
1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.
1.7.3. Pro: It is hazardous to leave the fate of the accused in the hands of a single person.
1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.7.5. Con: The ability of counsel to “strike out” potential jurors leads to a biased representation of the community in any given trial.
1.7.6. Con: These decisions usually take a long time. Long decisions are worse because while they happen the accused must remain in prison unjustly. Allowing these decisions to continue indefinitely forces potentially innocent people to remain in prison unjustly.
1.7.6.1. Pro: This is particularly bad for poor and disprivileged defendants who cannot afford bail, and must remain in jail until they are found innocent.
1.7.6.2. Con: If in the long run juries ultimately lead to fairer outcomes, this is preferable to more innocent people being found guilty and then spending many years in jail.
1.7.7. Con: Unanimity does not necessarily counter bias, since more powerful or outspoken jurors can sway the rest of the jury in accordance with their prejudices.
1.7.7.1. Pro: Confirmation bias is so much worse as a result of this. Most jurors are at least somewhat biased but don't want to say anything. All it takes is one outspoken juror to confirm everyone's initial biases and throw off the entire decision.
1.7.8. Pro: The requirement of unanimity forces the jurors to consider the facts as much as possible in order to reach consensus. No comparable incentive acts on judges.
1.7.8.1. Con: Judges have a professional reputation to maintain, and will be criticised if they do not consider the facts of a case sufficiently.
1.7.8.2. Con: Since judges have to write a judgement, they have much more of an incentive to consider all of the facts than jurors, who do not need to justify their reasoning.
1.7.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.7.8.3. Con: A robust appeals system holds judges accountable for every verdict they make. It is embarrassing to have a verdict overturned by the next judge to review the case, not to mention it tarnishes the judge's reputation. This acts as a powerful check and balance.

Juries have no such accountability built into the system.
1.7.8.4. Pro: Because of court clog, judges are actually incentivized to do the opposite, and turn out decisions as quickly as possible.
1.7.8.4.1. Con: The justice system faces a significant amount of court clog. Taking time to assemble juries eats away at time that could be spent seriously considering other cases, making the justice system run more slowly and inefficiently.
1.7.8.4.1.1. Con: That is a problem with how it is run, not necessarily with the use of juries itself. The system could be made more efficient. In any case, the other long timelines and delays inherent to the legal system dwarf the time taken on jury selection.
1.7.8.5. Pro: Taking time to really look into all of the facts of the case makes jurors more likely to empathize with the defendant, inform themselves on the nuances of the law, generate solid arguments for their opinions, etc. All of these things make the justice system more just.
1.8. Pro: Juries are more likely to be swayed in their decision making by emotional or irrational factors.
1.8.1. Con: As the fact-finders in a trial, Jurors educated about neurological processes can filter bias, manipulation, and error out of the trial process. Advances in neurology show us that the brain processes stimuli in certain ways: certain language triggers certain emotional biases, details of visual stimuli are largely "filled in" by the brain, and we process stimuli differently based on when we last ate. Sharp fact-finders are a check/balance against bias and emotionally persuasive legal arguments.
1.8.2. Con: The fact that juries take context and emotion into account is a benefit, not a flaw, of the system.
1.8.2.1. Con: When jurors decide according to their emotions, they are more likely to be swayed by instinctive prejudices like racism.
1.8.2.2. Pro: How a witness expresses their emotion on the stand may reflect the truthfulness of their testimony. Jurors are ordinary people who can assess that.
1.8.2.3. Con: Justice is supposed to be blind. Only the facts matter.
1.8.2.4. Con: Jurors should take their common sense into the courtroom, not their emotions. Whilst common sense can allow for sensible verdicts to be reached, an emotional juror is only a hindrance.
1.8.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.
1.8.3. Con: If judges are elected, as they are in some jurisdictions, they they are open to political influences which may interfere with their ability to reach unbiased decisions.
1.8.4. Con: Judges are just as emotional and biased as jurors.
1.8.4.1. Con: Judges are specifically trained to be impartial and consider only the facts.
1.8.4.2. Con: Even if judges are more emotional, they still have to abide by case law. If they do not follow it, they get fire or reprimanded. Juries are not held to this standard.
1.8.4.3. Pro: One study showed that the severity of judge decisions is [correlated](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889) with the timing of their meals and breaks.
1.8.4.4. Pro: 39 states in the U.S. [elect judges.](https://ballotpedia.org/Judicial_selection_in_the_states) They are particularly subject to partisan and ideological bias.
1.8.4.4.1. Pro: The [US Supreme Court](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/08/AR2009060801366.html) issued a ruling stating that excessive financial contributions to judges' election campaigns were a threat to fair trials.
1.8.4.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.8.5. Pro: Appeals to the jury often cater to prejudice and fear, and other emotional arguments that would not persuade a judge.
1.8.5.1. Con: Assuming that judges don't have their own prejudices. There are plenty of judges who play fast and loose with the law, and will legislate from the bench rather than enforce the law. At least with a jury it's not up to one person.
1.8.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.1.
1.8.6. Pro: Some lawyers [argue](http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/amjtrad17&div=11&id=&page=) that 85% of cases litigated are won or lost when the jury is selected, implying that facts are not impartially or consistently considered.
1.9. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.10. Pro: It takes a great deal of time and resources to assemble juries.
1.10.1. Con: The time and effort taken to assemble a fair jury is worth it if that jury delivers better outcomes than a judge would.
1.10.1.1. Con: This statement is not self-evidently true. For example, paying 140% more to enable a jury system \(as opposed to a judge-only system\) to gain outcomes that are merely 25% better would be wasteful. The relative cost and benefits need to be measured to prove this statement.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: It is essentially impossible to evaluate how just an outcome of a case is in quantitative terms. It is therefore not sensible to weigh it against financial cost in this manner.
1.10.1.2. Pro: The decisions of the judicial system have an immense impact on people's lives. This is more important than financial cost.
1.10.1.2.1. Pro: Criminal courts are empowered to punish people with custodial sentences. Putting someone in prison is a gross violation of an individual's liberty and requires a strong, fair and transparent process.
1.10.1.3. Con: That is arguably true, but it is unclear that juries do, or would, produce better results than judges.
1.10.2. Pro: There is a [large cost](http://www.ncsc-jurystudies.org/~/media/Microsites/Files/CJS/What%20We%20Do/SAVING%20MONEY%20FOR%20EVERYONE.ashx) to the economy inherent in using juries: For a single case resolution, 12 people are taken away from their regular jobs, sometimes for months at a time, leading to lots of lost productivity in the economy, all to achieve something \(a verdict\) that a judge could just as easily have done in their stead.
1.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.4.1.
1.10.4. Con: Jurys should be selected by random as they are to appear for jury selection. Lawyers should not be afforded the ability to select jurors they want as this then becomes a game. Random selection from voter registration and you get what you get. The constitution secures you to a trial by your peers not a trail by persons manipulated by lawyers.
1.10.4.1. Con: This would be a significant change to the current jury system and require reforming the system, suggesting it is not currently operating in a particularly effective way.
1.10.4.1.1. Con: Jury selection has become more important than the facts. It is more important to have the right group of jurist than to have the facts. This process also hampers our courts with sometimes very lengthy selections, costing exorbitant amounts of the courts money and time. It backs up dockets, which drives the plea bargain system \( which is another issue that should possibly be discussed here\). This adds nothing to the pursuit of Justice.
1.10.4.2. Pro: The complexities in the process of selecting juries are not inherent to their use. The processes could easily be streamlined.
1.10.5. Con: Juries ensure a fair trial and their more unbiased view is critical when dealing with a person's liberty.
1.10.6. Pro: When trials are widely publicized, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to find jurors who are not already biased by the media's presentation of the case.
1.10.6.1. Pro: [Many jurors](https://www.ft.com/content/d5f18a5c-bd6e-11e2-a735-00144feab7de) misunderstand contempt of court laws, and research the cases they are judging on the internet.
1.10.6.2. Con: If the media reported on the facts instead of opinion and [yellow journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism) there would be no bias from the media.
1.10.6.3. Con: The legal assumption that they must find jurors ignorant of events is not inherent to the use of juries. Jurists could be used regardless of their knowledge of the case.
1.10.6.4. Con: In cases of high public importance and thus media scrutiny, cases can be retried if there is evidence of jury bias and jurors are instructed to ignore any bias they may have formed due to exposure to the media.
1.10.6.5. Pro: After the Boston Marathon bombing, [over 1300 potential jurors](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-presumption-innocence) were interviewed, in an attempt to find people who did not have a close connection to the bombing, could fully consider the facts of the case, and were open to the possibility of the death penalty.
1.10.6.6. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.4.1.
1.10.7. Con: Most juries are selected in a single [day.](http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/Library3.nsf/pagecurrent/CF056B4CF5DBB14380258010003CFB75?opendocument&l=en)
1.10.8. Pro: Many people manage to [get out of jury duty](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/two-thirds-of-people-avoid-jury-service-739677.html) and this can result in difficulties forming fair juries, and a disproportionate number of [retired people and unemployed people](http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/07/rough_economy_makes_filling_nj.html) serving on juries.
1.10.8.1. Con: The imperfect mix of juries is not necessarily a problem.   There do not seem to be large-scale studies that show that juries with a larger portion of retirees or unemployed yields worse, or even different, outcomes than a jury more closely matching the population at large.
1.10.8.2. Con: This issue could easily be resolved by allowing less excuses for getting out of jury duty.
