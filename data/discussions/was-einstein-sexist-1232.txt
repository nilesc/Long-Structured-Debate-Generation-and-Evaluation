Discussion Title: Was Einstein Sexist?

1. Einstein was a [sexist](http://www.openculture.com/2013/12/albert-einstein-imposes-on-his-first-wife-a-cruel-list-of-marital-demands.html).
1.1. Con: Einstein was not a sexist. At the time he wrote the demands he simply was fed up with Mileva.
1.1.1. Pro: In a letter to Elsa Lowenthal, [Einstein](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/06/arts/dark-side-of-einstein-emerges-in-his-letters.html?pagewanted=all) wrote: "I treat my wife as an employee whom I cannot fire. I have my own bedroom and avoid being alone with her.''
1.1.2. Pro: Einstein did not want his wife to expect any intimacy from him, nor that she reproached him in any way. If he were sexist, he would have wanted the opposite. \(Regarding C\)
1.1.3. Pro: In another letter [Einstein](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/06/arts/dark-side-of-einstein-emerges-in-his-letters.html?pagewanted=all) described Mileva as ''an unfriendly, humorless creature."
1.1.4. Con: If he was simply fed up with Mileva it would have be less time-comsuming and easier for him to just separate.
1.1.4.1. Pro: After a short time Mileva left with the children and later on filed for divorce anyway.
1.1.4.2. Con: Einstein had pleaded for a divorce, but Marić [refused](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/even-einstein-was-a-fool-in-love/). Thus he issued such a shocking ultimatum.
1.1.5. Pro: No conversation, no sitting together and no intimacy. All this seems like Einstein was really fed up with his wife.
1.1.6. Pro: Throughout their marriage he continued to have [extramarital dalliances](http://mentalfloss.com/article/20812/everything-you-ever-wanted-know-about-albert-einstein).
1.1.7. Pro: Back in the days when he still was in [love](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/even-einstein-was-a-fool-in-love/) with his first wife, Mileva Marić, he wrote to her things such as “I feel alone with everyone except you.” This shows a deep bond and respect. His demands are not of sexist nature but simply due to faded love.
1.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.
1.2. Con: When Einstein wrote the note most of the mentioned demands were reality for the majority of wives. So regarded in context of time it was nothing dramatical.
1.2.1. Con: It may not have been dramatical at the time, but in form and content it still was sexist.
1.2.1.1. Con: The term "[sexism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism#History)" as we understand it today was only developed in the 1960s.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Eventhough the term was not coined until the 20th century, what we today regard as sexism did already exist beforehand.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Sexism may have been the impetus that fueled the [witch hunts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism#Witch_hunts_and_trials) and trials between the 15th and 18th centuries.
1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Until the 20th century, U.S. and English law observed the [system of coverture](https://web.archive.org/web/20081005032946/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/xblack.htm), where "by marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage".
1.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Gender has been used as a tool for discrimination against women in the political sphere. [Women's suffrage](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0931343.html) was not achieved until 1893, when New Zealand was the first country to grant women the right to vote.
1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.3. Pro: \(Social\) perception changes with time. Behavior patterns which are seen as unacceptable and sexist today, were completely normal back in the beginning of the 20th century.
1.2.3.1. Con: Eventhough it was completely normal to be an anti-semite back in the "Deutsches Reich", we still consider the people involved as Nazis / racists today. Thus, we can call someone "sexist" for his behaviour in the past, eventhough it may have been acceptable and normal back then.
1.2.3.2. Pro: As a child of his time Einstein cannot be judged by today's moral and social standards.
1.3. Pro: Einstein demanded typical "womens' tasks" from his wife. This is linked to classic stereotypes and gender roles, thus he can be regarded a sexist. \(Regarding A\)
1.3.1. Pro: From the kind of formulation \("you will..."\) Einstein used, it is clear that he regarded his wife as a subject to his orders.
1.3.2. Pro: From the beginning of his marriage with Mileva Maric, Einstein did not distribute domestic tasks equally. In a letter to a friend she [wrote](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200506/history.cfm) "We have a nice little household which I am taking care of quite alone."
1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3.4. Con: According to Einstein's letter he is quite aware of the fact that he treats his wife poorly and like an employee. If he was sexist, he would not have even mentioned it.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Being aware of his own poor behaviour do not excuse that behaviour. Being sexist is based on behaviour rather that ones own perception of that behaviour.
1.4. Con: The note of conditions to his wife merely shows Einstein's difficulty with personal relationships. It does not prove that he was sexist.
1.4.1. Pro: Einstein was simply asocial in general.
1.4.1.1. Pro: When he was a child, some medical professionals suggested his behavior as symptomatic of either [autism](http://mentalfloss.com/article/20812/everything-you-ever-wanted-know-about-albert-einstein) or Asperger's Syndrome.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: No one but a dr can diagnose a disorder. He was married, he was educated and had a job. We should not assume because someone is smart they had autism
1.4.1.2. Con: He demonstrated the [emotional capacity](http://mentalfloss.com/article/20812/everything-you-ever-wanted-know-about-albert-einstein) to develop both close friendships and passionate relationships.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Commanding someone to not talk / interact with oneself is an asocial act, not a sexist one.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Philosopher Bertrand Russell, who knew Einstein, said that "[personal matters](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-08-10/features/1994222020_1_called-einstein-albert-einstein-hans-albert) never occupied more than nooks and crannies in his thoughts."
1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.5. Con: The note of conditions can be regarded as a desperate approach of a husband to stay with his wife only for the sake of the children.
1.5.1. Pro: Einstein was willing to stay in a partnership without any love / emotional involvement, this merely shows that he was trying to be a good father.
1.5.1.1. Con: Einstein was not a good father.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Einstein abandoned his first illegitimate [daughter](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-08-10/features/1994222020_1_called-einstein-albert-einstein-hans-albert) \([Lieserl](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieserl_Marić)\).
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Einstein rarely [visited](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-08-10/features/1994222020_1_called-einstein-albert-einstein-hans-albert) his son Eduard, who suffered from schizophrenia, in the psychiatric clinic.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: When [Eduard](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/06/arts/dark-side-of-einstein-emerges-in-his-letters.html?pagewanted=all) passed away in 1965 Einstein had not seen him for 30 years.
1.5.1.1.3. Pro: Einstein did not have a close relationship with his elder son Hans Albert.
1.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: An assistant recalled that [Hans Albert](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-08-10/features/1994222020_1_called-einstein-albert-einstein-hans-albert), a longtime professor at the University of California at Berkeley, rarely spoke of his famous father, his family or his private life. And his daughter, Evelyn, sensed a suppressed resentment that fed on the many family secrets that his father had left behind.
1.5.1.1.4. Con: Einstein never failed in his [financial responsibilities](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-08-10/features/1994222020_1_called-einstein-albert-einstein-hans-albert), always paying the bills for his ailing son and supporting his first wife, Mileva Maric Einstein.
1.5.1.1.5. Con: From [this correspondence](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1211594-1,00.html) you can tell that Einstein was exerted about the relationship with his son Hans Albert. He wanted to teach him maths and go on hiking vacation with him but was not able to, because of the war and argumentations with Mileva.
1.5.1.1.5.1. Pro: In 1915 Einstein wrote a [letter](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1211594-4,00.html) to Hans Albert: "I will try to be with you for a month every year so that you will have a father who is close to you and can love you. You can learn a lot of good things from me that no one else can offer you. The things I have gained from so much strenuous work should be of value not only to strangers but especially to my own boys \(...\)."
1.5.2. Con: According to that list he was not willing to contribute to an improvement of the situation.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The note of conditions only lists orders for his wife and not a single one for him \(unlike e.g. modern prenups\).
1.5.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.7. Con: Einstein, in his note of demands, comes along as misogynistic, rather than sexist.
1.7.1. Con: Einstein's [treatment](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200506/history.cfm) of female colleagues and professionals was exemplary.
1.7.1.1. Pro: That was not normal at that time. For example there are notes of the famous scientist [Max Planck](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200506/history.cfm) being clearly sexist at workplace.
1.7.1.2. Pro: [Einstein](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200506/history.cfm) helped female scientists \(Marietta Blau, Emmy Noether\) by writing letters of recommendation for them.
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: Einstein called Emmy [Noether](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/five-historic-female-mathematicians-you-should-know-100731927/?page=5) as a "creative mathematical genius."
1.7.1.2.1.1. Pro: A male who compliments women in such a way is no sexist.
1.7.1.3. Pro: Einstein wrote a supporting [letter](http://www.popsugar.com/tech/Albert-Einstein-Letter-Marie-Curie-36239395) to Marie Curie telling her to ignore the colleagues who depreciated the female scientist.
1.8. Con: Walter [Isaacson](https://jrbenjamin.com/2013/12/11/einstein-breaks-up-with-his-first-girlfriend/) asserts in his book "Einstein: His Life and Universe" that the scientist, beside all the stereotypes, loved women and vice versa.
1.8.1. Pro: After breaking up with his first grildfriend he noted “It fills me with a peculiar kind of satisfaction that now I myself have to taste some of the pain that I brought upon the dear girl through my thoughtlessness and ignorance of her delicate nature". It showcases the respect he had for her.
1.8.2. Pro: In a [love note](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/albert-einsteins-tangled-love-life-exposed-his-personal-letters-1478644) to his second wife, Einstein wrote: "Tonight I'm sleeping in your bed! It is peculiar how confusedly sentimental one is. It is just a bed like any other, as though you had not yet ever slept in it. And yet I find it comforting that I may lay myself in it, somewhat, like a tender confidence."
1.8.3. Con: Love for women is completely unrelated to having a sexist attitude.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.7.
1.10. Pro: Einstein commanded his [wife](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2133922/Was-Einstein-worlds-worst-husband-Wife-ordered-room-tidy-serve-meals-day--expect-NO-affection--stop-talking-demands-it.html) to stop talking if he wishes.
1.10.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.10.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.3.
1.10.3. Con: -> See 1.3.4.
1.11. Con: It is impossible, ignorant and unacceptable to judge a person by a single letter.
1.11.1. Pro: Every individual has dark sides, bad moods or desperate moments. Humans are emotional and feeling beings and no robots; and so was Einstein.
1.12. Con: -> See 1.7.1.
1.13. Con: In September 1946 Einstein corresponded with a young South African girl called Tyfanny, who wanted to become a scientist. In a [letter](http://io9.gizmodo.com/5900385/einsteins-advice-to-women-in-science-still-relevant-more-than-60-years-later) she said that she was a girl and that she hoped he did not think any less of her because of that. He responded: "I do not mind that you are a girl, but the main thing is that you yourself do not mind. There is no reason for it."
1.13.1. Pro: Einstein's encouraging letter is the right opposite of sexist behavior.
1.13.2. Pro: Basically the statement of Einstein's answer is that gender does not matter to him, that he was "[gender blind](http://www.thegrindstone.com/2012/04/10/education/albert-einstein-was-gender-blind-when-it-came-to-women-in-science-173/)".
