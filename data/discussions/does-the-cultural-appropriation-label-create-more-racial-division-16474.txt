Discussion Title: Does the "cultural appropriation" label create more racial division?

1. The label "cultural appropriation" creates more racial division.
1.1. Con: The term is not creating racism and division, it is raising awareness.
1.1.1. Pro: The "cultural appropriation" label is raising awareness that the people who are represented in the media as portraying a culture are not from that culture and aren't the best ones to portray it.
1.1.1.1. Pro: It is not moral to portray a culture that has been discriminated so badly in the past, especially if you are part of the group of people who created that suffering.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: The actions of people someone shares creed with are not their fault, nor are they their problem. Especially if the wrongdoing happened before they even existed.
1.1.2. Pro: This term is simply bringing to light an action that is considered offensive to those of minority cultures.
1.1.3. Con: Raising awareness can result in more division.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Raising awareness brings the issue to the forefront, where its likely to garner pushback from those doing the appropriating.
1.2. Con: Cultural appropriation helps people be aware of offensive racial stereotypes.
1.3. Pro: The term and its usage sets up borders of what can and cannot be done due to a certain cultural or ethnical background.
1.4. Con: To call out cultural appropriation makes the "perpetrators" aware of what they are doing and \(hopefully\) makes them think about why are they doing it.
1.4.1. Con: This 'calling out' creates witchhunts on people without bad intentions.
1.5. Pro: The term merely serves to divide people further, and pulling us away from each other instead of promoting acceptance and tolerance.
1.6. Pro: It feeds the "us and them" mindset, instead of acknowledging that we are all just us.
1.6.1. Con: The action of cultural appropriation is what perpetuates the 'us and them' mindset. Feeding this mindset stops when the action itself is curtailed.
1.7. Con: It may create more division, but this is a small cost compared to the suffering of those experiencing their culture being appropriated for trivial ends.
1.8. Pro: The "cultural appropriation" label makes people see racial differences rather than equality.
1.8.1. Pro: The "cultural appropriation" label claims people should keep their culture for themselves: that means that only a few people can do things a certain way. This is discrimination.
1.8.2. Pro: Some people are now being held responsible for their ancestor's actions even when they did not take part in them.
1.8.3. Con: Bias and discrimination based on race exist and thus 'seeing' racial differences is not inherently a bad thing. The only way to reach true equality is to acknowledge discrimination.
1.9. Pro: The term creates division because we are all "cultural appropriators" in a way.
1.9.1. Pro: Almost all of our cultures, as they are today, have taken characteristics from other cultures.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Several aspects of Christian celebration such as [Christmas](https://www.history.com/topics/christmas/history-of-christmas) and [Easter](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/apr/03/easter-pagan-symbolism) are heavily adapted from old pagan religions.
1.9.1.2. Con: While most cultures have mixed and borrowed from one another it is still possible to distinguish between colonizing cultures from cultures who have been colonized.
1.9.2. Con: Melding of cultures does not constitute cultural appropriation, it is a natural and non-invasive process in communities consisting of members of several different cultures.
1.10. Pro: The "cultural appropration" movement is blaming people who have no intention to be racist.
1.10.1. Con: More often than not, racist attitudes are unconscious or not done on purpose: that does not mean they are not racist.
1.10.2. Con: The lack of intention to do harm does not absolve the blame. Neither does ignorance.
