Discussion Title: Should recipients of government benefits be recruitable by municipalities for work?

1. Recipients of welfare and unemployment benefits should be recruit-able by municipalities for work.
1.1. Con: This might cause a situation, where the welfare recipient might find himself in an endless loop of empty jobs that hinder his opportunities of getting out of unemployment
1.2. Con: The time spent working at municipalities is time the person could be spending looking for private work or in rehabilitation programs, thus prolonging the time they are on welfare.
1.2.1. Con: Welfare may not have such a negative connotation. It may be acceptable for someone to stay on welfare if they choose to do so. I assume in this case private jobs would be preferable and that would be the incentive.
1.3. Pro: This would help save taxpayer money.
1.4. Pro: This would relieve work shortages on the municipal level.
1.5. Pro: This would help the unemployed obtain skills and experience.
1.5.1. Con: Most of these jobs would most likely involve few advanced skills. Otherwise, they would pay well and be taken by other, regular workers.
1.6. Pro: Tax payers feel better about what their money is being used on.
1.7. Con: It is immoral to allow people to have nothing if they choose not to work.
1.7.1. Con: It's immoral to take money from people to give to others.
1.7.1.1. Con: Redistribution is key to make a society work.
1.7.2. Con: You could give reduced pay for not working.
1.8. Con: This may cause other job losses.
1.8.1. Con: This could easily be prevented by setting up this system in the right way.
1.8.1.1. Pro: The utilization of welfare recipients could be limited to open positions that haven't been filled in several months.
1.8.2. Pro: Govt may choose to go with the lower paying welfare/Unemployment option over regular pay.
1.8.3. Con: More Jobs will be created.
