Discussion Title: Has Religion Been a Good Thing for Humanity?

1. Religion has been a good thing for humankind.
1.1. Pro: Religion has created valuable moral codes and philosophical frameworks.
1.1.1. Pro: Our understanding of "good" and "humanity" are mostly grounded in religion. Saying religion has not been good is a contradiction because religion has defined the meaning of "good" in our development as a species.
1.1.1.1. Con: The more we learn about other animals, particularly social species, the more we understand that moral and ethical behaviors are not simply human characteristics.  And given that only humans have religion, it would be incorrect to say what we understand as good or human is grounded in religion.  Those without religion understand what is or is not good, and it has more to do with our instincts as an empathizing social species.    [Finding Morality in Animals](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/morality_animals)
1.1.1.2. Con: This amounts to "we're-right-because-we-say-we're-right". It's evidence that religion is bad for humanity, because it amounts to letting the few tell the many what they have to do and what they can't do, under threat not just of being in the wrong but of eternal damnation.
1.1.1.3. Con: Religion is not the only source of ethics, [secular ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_ethics) exists and can be used to evaluate whether or not religion is good this is not a contradiction.
1.1.1.4. Con: If moral codes were universally originated in religion there would be more homogeneity between cultures and not countless different religious denominations across the world.
1.1.1.5. Pro: The very notion of "good" would not exist in the absence of religion, without a [transcendent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_and_evil#Transcendental_realism) instance, beyond human reach.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: Good and bad are subjective terms that make up a dichotomy. They are often defined by each other, not by religion. Things are good only in comparison to bad things and vice versa. This does not require religion to work.
1.1.1.5.2. Con: Since humans are in any case those who interpret and apply the transcendental notion of good, even if this is sanctioned by a higher power, its application is bound to abuse or misuse, in the same manner that any human construct on morality and ethics is.
1.1.1.5.2.1. Con: Human judgement is indeed imperfect. Yet, the notion of good remains the same irrespective of any human judgement. This is why, for example, in Christian Bible it is said not to judge. This is the atribute of the divinity.
1.1.1.6. Con: Perceptions of "good" and "humanity" could have been derived naturally or elsewhere, and then transcribed into religion.
1.1.1.6.1. Pro: There is no tangible and specific evidence that what is deemed good or bad is actually based on religion.
1.1.1.6.2. Pro: [Natural morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_morality) is the moral philosophy describing how we arrived at the morals we currently possess through evolution and thus such morals help us survive as individuals and as a species.
1.1.2. Pro: Religions provided, for centuries, common behavioral guidelines for the society, enabling an organized and peaceful coexistence \(what constitutions and legal codes do today\).
1.1.2.1. Con: History has been quite the [opposite of peaceful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_wars) for virtually all of recorded human existence. Peaceful coexistence has simply not been a feature of reality.
1.1.2.2. Con: Modern propagation of news gives the unintentional impression that there was a good-old-days by spreading bad news far more efficiently than in the past and far more efficiently than the good news progress, much of it secular or scientific, has wrought. Rather than peaceful coexistence there was relative ignorance of war, murders, theft, bigotry etc.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Religion helps people focus on the present by finding peace in God's will and trusting in his plans and guidance. This inner peace permeates outwards and reduces conflict.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: Peace can imply complacency in which one simply stands by and allows atrocities to occur to themselves and others. Things such as the [bystander effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect) illustrate just how complacent humans already are without a shift in attitude of only focusing on the present and on inner piece.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Many religions hold peace and tolerance as core values
1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Christianity instills values of peace and non-violence.
1.1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: Christianity [compels](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20&version=NIV) its followers not to kill, commit adultery, or steal.
1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Contemporary law is not based at all on the 10 commandments. The first four are about god and the sabbath none of which appears in contemporary  western law. Honoring your parents may be expected but is not required. Killing is permitted under certain circumstances \(self defense\). Adultery and coveting goods are not illegal either. Theft and perjury are all that remain.
1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Even [perjury has been watered down to varying degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury). Generally it can only be illegal if you're lying to the police or under oath.
1.1.2.3.2.1.2. Pro: One of the 10 commandments is "thou shalt not kill".
1.1.2.3.2.1.3. Con: Religion has preached intolerance for centuries and persecuted people for just as long, people typically do not want to be persecuted and so it would seem that at least not all religions hold that you should treat all others as you would want to be treated.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: Religion has historically had to catch up and modify its morality to fit the changing secular standards. If its moral code was truly beneficial it wouldn't have to play catch up to secular ethics.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: The [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_slavery) was used as both an argument for and against [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_slavery).
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: Christian responses to domestic abuse have been catching up to secular standards over the past 40 years. [Many pastors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_domestic_violence#Responses_to_abuse) have said and many continue to say that they would never advise a women to leave an abusive husband, and many advise forgiveness and enduring.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Recently church leaders such as the Pope and bishops have openly condemned this behavior and with more women pastors entering the ranks the responses are finally catching up to secular standards.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.3. Pro: The [Catholic church molestation scandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases) show that until pressed by secular authorities religious ones are content to hide their crimes.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: A report estimated about [7% of clergy](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/13/catholic-sexual-abuse-partly-caused-by-celibacy-and-secrecy-report-finds) had abused children between about 1950 and 2000.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.3.2. Con: The Congregation of the [Servants of the Paraclete](http://mtcarmelrenewalcenter.org/about/) was founded in the 1940's by Fr. Gerald Fitzgerald to expose and help prevent child sexual abuse by the clergy.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.3.2.1. Con: Fitzgerald started to assist priests dealing with substance abuse but soon began receiving priests who had sexually abused minors. He did not bring them to justice and was [against secular treatments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_of_the_Servants_of_the_Paraclete) like psychiatry and psychology.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.3.2.2. Con: Fitzgerald recommended some priests to be laicized but, in general, most bishops chose to [ignore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_of_the_Servants_of_the_Paraclete) his recommendations and kept employing priests with sexual abuse history.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.3.2.3. Con: The center was [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_of_the_Servants_of_the_Paraclete) in the 1990s as the result of lawsuits over priests who had molested children while staying at the center or after being treated at the facility.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.3.2.4. Con: Abusive priests from all over the US where brought to the Monastery run by the Servants of the Paracletes since 1947. Very often, those priests were released to work with [non-white and poor communities](https://rewire.news/religion-dispatches/2018/08/27/from-pa-to-new-mexico-colonialism-and-the-crisis-inside-the-crisis-of-catholic-sexual-abuse/) and very often sexual abuses continued. In that sense, the church disposed of abusive priest in predominately white and mid-western communities to bring them to poorer and brown communities, without ever truly eradicating sexual abuse.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.3.2.4.1. Pro: Fr. Edward Graff \(included in the [Pennsylvania grand jury report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/08/14/pennsylvania-grand-jury-report-on-sex-abuse-in-catholic-church-will-list-hundreds-of-accused-predator-priests/?utm_term=.c90e5d6dca61)\) was moved from Allentown where the report alleges “raped scores of children” to the Monastery. Eventually, in 1980, he was released and worked in Texas and New Mexico until being arrested for [sexually abusing](https://rewire.news/religion-dispatches/2018/08/27/from-pa-to-new-mexico-colonialism-and-the-crisis-inside-the-crisis-of-catholic-sexual-abuse/) a minor. In the investigation, it was discovered he would employ and potentially abuse young and poor Hispanic youth. He died in prison before trial.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.4. Pro: The Catholic church preached as doctrine that the Jews were collectively responsible for [deicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_deicide). This belief fostered two millennia of antisemitism and was only [repudiated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_deicide#Repudiation) and removed as doctrine in 1962 during the second Vatican Council. This antisemitism was part of the environment that allowed Hitler's rise.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.5. Con: Secular and religious ethics are vastly intertwined. In religious doctrines you are asked to do good and be good. This doesn't mean that religion introduced these ethics but it did help propagate them.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.5.1. Con: While the set of secular morals/ethics can change and be added to as we learn, religion does not change. That makes religion a barrier to morals and ethics beyond those it subscribes to.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.5.1.1. Pro: The bible ends in [68AD](https://ichthys.com/mail-Bible%20chrono.htm), at the end of Revelations, and was finished by Apostle John in [95AD](https://www.biblica.com/resources/bible-faqs/when-was-the-bible-written/) at least 1804 years before any currently living person was born. Nothing was added when we learnt to treat women and men equally, nor when we learnt that cowering is not "yes" and "no" is relevant in marriage, nor when we learnt to treat each others' sexual preferences equally.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: If there is a God he won't have overlooked the morals the bible does. Remember the [story](https://truthbook.com/stories/funny-god/the-drowning-man): A man on a roof in a flood who waits for God to save him and turns down three forms of salvation before drowning. Then God tells him that he sent those three. Religion has ignored much that it could have seen as messages from God over the last 1800 years. There's been more than a rowboat, a motorboat and a helicopter in that time but religion is still not seeing the signs.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.5.2. Con: Secular ethics and religious ethics are distinguished by where they come from. A framework of secular ethics may have the same exact tenets as a religious one and yet be derived in a completely different way. It is also possible for them to have completely differing tenets. The definition of secular ethics is that it is not derived from religion thus the term secular. So without completely redefining the terms we are using it is impossible to say that they are the same.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.5.3. Pro: Even if the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule#Ancient_Egypt) \(treating other as ones would wish to be treated\) was not invented by Christianity, Christianity did make it popular.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.5.3.1. Con: Religion takes claim of things without regard for the original source; often absorbing aspects of subjected people's culture, as a mean to further control and dominate them.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.5.4. Pro: [Scholasticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism) acted as a bridge between Greek and Roman knowledge and Christian theology, as a way of teaching that [focused](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Western-philosophy/Medieval-philosophy) on "logic, dialectic, and all the scientific disciplines known at the time".
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.5.4.1. Con: The fact that religious people did logical things does not imply that they did it because they were religious.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.6. Con: The higher rate of change of secular ethics does not make them more true. It just means religious ethics move more slowly. This could be a good thing, when the common opinion is changed for the worse.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.6.1. Con: Most religions' primary texts are finalized at some point. After that their ethics don't move slowly—they don't move at all.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.7. Pro: [Blasphemy laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law) have been overturned slowly over time and some still exist. This runs counter to the secular ideal of free speech and is slowly being stripped away in the western world.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.8. Pro: Religion still to this day condemns the morality of the LGBT community, a practice modern western society condemns as bigotry.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.8.1. Pro: Religion can be used as a protective barrier to further discriminatory, or harmful views that would otherwise be seen as violations of rights. For example, refusing to provide services for LGBT+ individuals on the basis of exercising religious freedom.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.9. Pro: Religion moves too slow in regard to society therefore their values are too archaic to be useful
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.9.1. Con: Martin Luther Kings famously [analogised](https://stanfordfreedomproject.com/multi-media-essays-on-freedom/the-biblical-exodus-in-the-rhetoric-of-martin-luther-king/) the struggle of the civil rights movement to the biblical story of [Exodus](http://videri.org/index.php?title=Martin_Luther_King_and_the_Rhetoric_of_Freedom:_The_Exodus_Narrative_in_America%27s_Struggle_for_Civil_Rights), proving that religion is not archaic if recontextualised correctly.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2. Pro: The moral codes often found in religious texts have been the cause of many social injustices including the persecution of homosexuals, people of colour and women.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: To give some idea of the scope of this issue, including persecution of those perceived as atheists: The percentage of us who are white male heterosexual Christians \(using this group not as definitive, but only to get us in the right ballpark\) is very low, so the vast majority of us are potential targets.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: Religion often condemns [homosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_religion).
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3. Pro: Religion has tried to control women's bodies by banning abortion, birth control and contraception.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1. Con: Opposing abortion is a testament to the preservation of life. Abortion can be viewed as killing potential life.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.1. Con: The preservation of life leads to overpopulation, which leads to famine, spreading of diseases, and many other causes of death. So saving some lives indirectly kills much more lives. [Overpopulation effects.](http://www.everythingconnects.org/overpopulation-effects.html)
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.1.1. Con: The preservation of life has a [marginal effect](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/causes-effects-solutions-of-overpopulation.php) on population growth. Other factors to take into consideration are: the decrease in mortality rates, the overcoming of poverty, advancements in fertility treatments, immigration and the lack of family planning.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Religiosity has [decreased](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/do-countries-lose-religion-as-they-gain-wealth-1.1310451) internationally, especially in developed countries, and many believers do not follow every religious teaching, yet if most of the world’s population did, overpopulation could be a bigger problem.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [Roman Catholic Church](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/contraception_1.shtml) refuses artificial methods of contraception; many [Hindus](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/contraception.shtml) are unlikely to use contraception; in [Orthodox Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_contraception), birth control is not acceptable or only to use in limited circumstances and although [Islam](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/contraception.shtml) allows contraception, more conservative leaders campaign against it.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Opposing birth control and contraception can be viewed as advocating against promiscuity.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Regardless of how one views it the consequences are real and can be shown.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Religion has made promiscuity a bad thing, because if women had multiple partners the filiation link couldn't be established. By forcing monogamy \(at least for women \) on humanity , religion portrayed "promiscuity" as a bad thing. But one could see it as a very natural thing, to respond to one's desires.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Opposing birth control also increases venereal disease.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: When contraception is prohibited even between married spouses, promiscuity is not the key element in its prohibition.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See discussion #9226: Global overpopulation is a myth.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.2.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.2. Pro: Killing potential life is immoral
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3. Con: Control does not imply harm.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.1. Con: "Forced conversions" implies harm would befall the converted if they would not convert. Therefore, this conversion is harmful to the well-being of the converted.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.2. Pro: Control is not necessarily harming people. [Leadership and followship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_leadership_theory) can be beneficial to both parties. Power is sometimes viewed as only tyrannical control over the populations, but we often forget the benevolent and caring side of organized social structures.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.2.1. Con: Even if control was beneficial for a person, it would still be unjustified. Each person should have the right to decide how they will live their life, and noone should be able to make that decision for them. To decide otherwise is the beginning of tyranny.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.2.1.1. Con: People can value security over freedom and therefore feel happier when they don't have to choose everything themselves. Excessive choice is tyranny to some.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.2.2. Pro: Traditionally, a [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy) is a way for the followers to elect the leaders. People choose and respect the most competent people that they can trust to rule over them and represent their views on large scale issues.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.2.2.1. Con: Democracy is a very inefficient type of government structure. It is maintained as a social luxury, not for its merit.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.2.1.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4. Pro: Religious social control can be and most often is consensually chosen by the believers themselves, particularly among converts.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.1. Con: If the religion has control over public policy and uses it to exert social control, then non-believers will also be forced to adhere nonconsensually to the control created. [Pew Article on views on abortion](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/22/american-religious-groups-vary-widely-in-their-views-of-abortion/)[Views on homosexuality](http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/views-about-homosexuality/)
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.2. Con: Religious control uses emotion and faith which ignore reason. This makes the religion itself and the individuals less able to rationally evaluate social impacts or structures. A tipping point emerges when a religion cannot assess appropriate impacts within a larger group and are outcast as cult.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.2.1. Pro: The problem is more profound when the religion wields too much influence for it to be outcast.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3. Con: Being born and indoctrinated into a faith is not voluntary. Moreover several religions place severe consequences on those who leave.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3.1. Pro: If you leave Islam in certain countries you will die. If you leave Jehova's witnesses you will never speak to your family again. Same with the Amish. But more importantly you did not choose to have the religion forced on you as a child and it may be so deep in your brain that you could never escape.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3.2. Pro: [Religious Trauma Syndrome \(RTS\)](http://www.babcp.com/Review/RTS-Trauma-from-Leaving-Religion.aspx) “is a function of both the chronic abuses of harmful religion and the impact of severing one’s connection with one’s faith” and can be compared to a combination of PTSD and Complex PTSD.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3.3. Pro: Religions are routinely introduced to children who are too young to make an informed choice.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3.3.1. Con: Children are capable of choice, but the degree to which they can make an informed and/or rational decision will vary from not at all, through not enough, to a minority who are as capable of making a decision as an adult.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3.3.2. Pro: [Circumcision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision#Cultures_and_religions) is performed by Jews on the eighth day of life.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3.3.3. Pro: The [First Communion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Communion) is normally received around the ages of 7 to 10  after a period or [cathequesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechesis) \(education\). And [Confirmation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation#cite_note-28), the time when the believer really gives consent, also happens when children are young or in their mid-teens.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3.3.4. Pro: Catholic parents [baptise](http://www.annunciationevv.org/Guidelines-for-Baptism) their children when they are babies and thus introduce them into the Catholic faith when they cannot consent.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3.4. Pro: Hasidic Jews are [indoctrinated](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/21/ex-hasidim-life-stories_n_7343084.html) from a young age, often poorly educated \(with lack of English skills\) and pressured to have and provide for big families at really young ages. Those who try to live [secularly](http://www.nycreligion.info/leaving-ultraorthodox-judaism/) are often completely [rejected](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/magazine/the-high-price-of-leaving-ultra-orthodox-life.html) and, in many cases, their religious communities fight to keep custody of their [children](https://www.refinery29.com/2017/10/177040/netflix-one-of-us-orthodox-jewish-women-abuse-etty?bucketed=true).
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.4. Con: Through history, most often than not religion social control is imposed. Nowadays it is imposed by social stigma in some countries.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.5. Con: Forcing women to continue their pregnancy and give birth may be harmful for the woman. Also, having to raise an unplanned child in a difficult economical or social environment can be a source of pain, such as starvation.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.5.1. Pro: Fetuses do not have a conscious mind capable of experiencing pain and suffering. Pain reception only develops well into the [third trimester](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-does-consciousness-arise/) of pregnancy.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.5.2. Pro: As the fetus is a biological extension of the mother, it is up to her do with it what she sees fit.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.5.3. Con: Not all religious people view abortion as wrong.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.5.3.1. Con: In a lot of cases, even if individual believers do not think abortion is wrong, their religious teachings say otherwise.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.5.3.1.1. Pro: The [Roman Catholic Church](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/abortion_1.shtml#h2) considers an abortion "a grave moral wrong"; in [Sikhism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/sikhethics/abortion.shtml) abortion if forbiden; [Hinduism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/abortion_1.shtml) is opposed to it, except where it is necessary to save the mother; [Islam](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml) regards abortion as wrong and forbidden though with vital exceptions and [Judaism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/abortion_1.shtml) only permits it for serious reasons.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.5.3.2. Pro: Some [Catholics](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/abortion_1.shtml#h2) disagree with the Vatican about abortion and the Church has expressed the right and  responsibility of each believer "to follow his or her own conscience on moral matters, even when it conflicts with Church teaching".
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.5.4. Con: Many religious people feel that while abortion is wrong, it goes against the tenets of that religion to force that belief on others.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.5.5. Con: This is to prevent the greater harm of a death of a child. Religious view abortion as killing a human being with a soul and abhorrent in the same way most people would feel about killing an infant.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.5.5.1. Pro: The murder of children is wrong
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.5.5.2. Con: While it is true that religious people view abortion as killing a human being it is not true that a fetus is equivalent to a child.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.5.5.3. Con: The Catholic Church cares much more about the new adept-to-be rather than the wellness of women.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.5.6. Pro: -> See discussion #5637: Women should have the right to choose abortion.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.6. Pro: The creation of standardized structures of morality keeps society predictable and manageable by those who live within them.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.6.1. Con: Religion is not required to create these standardised structures. Morality can successfully be defined by secular methods as well.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.6.2. Con: Creating one standardized structure of morality is near impossible even within one religion, much less in a way that creates predictability about how you should live. Evidence for this is differing opinions on any number of moral issues between different sects of Christianity, Islam or Judaism. If you live in society where multiple sects or multiple religions coexist whose standard prevails?
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.7. Con: Control implies a reduction in freedom. Individual freedom should not be impinged upon except to protect others.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.7.1. Con: Limiting individual freedom is necessary for group activities. The limitations of freedom a parent places on a child are for that child's own good, and similarly it does not follow that the controls exerted by religious adherence are necessarily bad for the individual.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.7.1.1. Con: A gilded cage is still a cage.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.8. Pro: Social control is not a minus in environments lacking other forms of control.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.9. Pro: The state is a form of social control too. Control is necessary to safeguard the rules that keep society safe and working and to protect the values we hold important. Without control, society would not exist.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.10. Pro: Control is needed for a society to advance.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.4. Pro: This regulation made overpopulation worse. [Overpopulation](http://churchandstate.org.uk/2015/12/how-religion-is-making-overpopulation-worse/) is the main cause of many major problems around the world.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.1.1.

1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.5. Pro: The [Roman Catholic Church](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/abortion_1.shtml#h2) considers an abortion "a grave moral wrong"; in [Sikhism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/sikhethics/abortion.shtml) abortion if forbiden; [Hinduism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/abortion_1.shtml) is opposed to it, except where it is necessary to save the mother; [Islam](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml) regards abortion as wrong and forbidden though with vital exceptions and [Judaism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/abortion_1.shtml) only permits it for serious reasons.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.5.1. Con: Some [Catholics](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/abortion_1.shtml#h2) disagree with the Vatican about abortion and the Church has expressed the right and responsibility of each believer "to follow his or her own conscience on moral matters, even when it conflicts with Church teaching".
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.5.6.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4. Pro: Many religions instill views of shame and sin regarding sexual relationships.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.1. Pro: Some religions do not approve pre-marital sex.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: [Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_sexuality#Judaism) rejects premarital sex and views it as a sin.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.1.2. Pro: [Traditional Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_sexuality#Judaism) prohibits sexual relations outside of heterosexual marriages.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.1.3. Pro: [The Catholic Church](https://www.catholic.com/tract/birth-control) believes that artificial contraception is sinful and immoral, and that sex should be reserved to marriage.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.1.3.1. Pro: [Monty Python make the case for contraception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUspLVStPbk)
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.2. Pro: Anti-sex [views](http://metro.co.uk/2017/04/21/its-sexual-happiness-day-so-lets-talk-about-sex-guilt-6588843/) can have deep and [harmful psychological](https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/love-sex/77129141/Religious-or-cultural-beliefs-making-you-feel-guilty-about-sex) effects.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.3. Pro: Religious views regarding sex rely on harmful stereotypes that often place women's virginity and purity as the measure of a woman's worth.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.3.1. Pro: Gendered expectations around virginity often mean that women view virginity loss as giving something away and are encouraged to protect their virginity, while men losing their virginity is viewed as a way to gain status and experience.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: Traditional sexual scripts have resulted in women largely viewing virginity as a gift and something that they therefore have to be careful about giving away, while men see virginity as a stigma and think of its loss as a relief [\(Humphreys, p. 672\)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00224499.2012.677868?needAccess=true).
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.3.1.2. Pro: In the US, there has been a spread of [virginity balls](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/purity-balls-girls-in-the-us-making-virginity-pledges-as-fathers-vow-to-protect-purity-10271933.html) in Christian communities, where young women attend a ball with their fathers and pledge to abstain from sex until marriage. This often involves the fathers vowing to protect their daughter's purity and therefore equates virginity with purity for women.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.4. Con: Shame and sin regarding sexual relationships can encourage more stable relationships in society. Polygamy is linked to social discontent and [war](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2017/12/19/the-link-between-polygamy-and-war), as an individual man taking multiple wives for himself leaves many other men without a wife. Monogamous relationships encouraged by Judeo-Christian \(and other\) values have been stated as the cause of the [success of societies such as ancient Rome, and Western Europe.](http://theconversation.com/society-wide-benefits-of-monogamous-marriage-6908)
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.4.1. Con: The [roman republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic) began in 509 BC and the first christian emperor was during the reign of [Constantine the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great) \(306-337AD\) the[western half of the empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire) then dissolved in 480AD the vast majority of Roman prosperity in the western European area then was before Christianity was even legal in the region.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.5. Con: Shame and sin can still be instilled on people's sexual relationships in secular societies. For example, in [China](https://www.outrightinternational.org/content/china-legal-position-and-status-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-people-people%E2%80%99s), which is predominately atheist, there is still a huge social stigma against homosexuality.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.5.1. Pro: In civil law, it was not until 1997 that the vague law called "hooliganism", which was primarily used as a de-facto ban on consensual homosexual conduct, was repealed.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.5.2. Pro: There are no laws that protect LGBT peoples from [discrimination](https://www.outrightinternational.org/content/china-legal-position-and-status-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-people-people’s) from workplaces under the Chinese Labour Law.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.5.3. Con: [According to a study and scholars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_China) homophobia did not take root in China until the 19th and 20th centuries and was due to Westernization. As such, it would be the countries of Europe who were predominately Christian at the time which originally influenced and created the stigma in China.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5. Pro: Several religious denominations have often supported gender inequality.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.1. Pro: Orthodox Judaism is not [egalitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarianism#Judaism) and opposes women being [rabbis](http://jbuff.com/c091607.htm).
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.2. Pro: Many [religions](http://www.bishopofmaidstone.org/male-headship-the-theological-basis/) support [complementarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarianism), a view that favors [male supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarianism) as it defines men as the heads of the house and the Church.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.2.1. Pro: [Research](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X\(15\)00013-3/fulltext) points that domestic abuse is higher in regions across the globe "where norms related to male authority over female behavior are more common".
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.2.2. Con: This statement is only 'true' for the judeo-christian religions but are in no way defined as absolute truths \(and often debated\) in many other religions or sub-denominations. In non-judeo-christian religions it is also not implied that because 1 source of authority claims something, everybody else accepts this, which is quite different in catholic, judean or islamic 'hierarchies' or power structures.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.3. Pro: Although [Jainism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/beliefs/women.shtml) is a religion of equality that seeks liberation and recognizes the rights of all living creatures \(including animals\), some sects consider liberation impossible for women without being reborn into men, and many denominations consider women harmful, impure or ‘second-class’ citizens .
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.3.1. Con: The words 'some' indicates that it might be a marginal strand of the religion thus it cannot count as an argument for religion itself to be biased \(in favor of males\) or patriarchal. Also there are also many [denominations](https://listverse.com/2013/10/04/10-forgotten-ancient-religions/) that adore women and consider them sacred so in the end, it could balance out.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4. Pro: Abrahamic ethics includes the [commandment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_covet) "You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor." This lumps people and wives particularly in as property. This is generally not seen as a kind thing.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.1. Con: You own yourself as you would property.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.1.1. Con: However, you do not own your spouse, which is what seems to be implied in the commandment.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.2. Con: This is meant as a lesson on jealousy, not as a commentary on the worth of women.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.2.1. Con: Yet it positions jelousy as coveting someone's possessions and those possessions include women, servants, a house and animals.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.3. Con: Religious based discrimination often just reflected the attitudes of the time, thus other forces, not religion, drove those views.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.3.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon, a text written in the [1830s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon), [included](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/mormons-race-max-perry-mueller/539994/) a number of contemporary racist themes.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.3.2. Pro: The Apostle Paul's [views on women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle_and_women) likely [reflected](https://www.crosswalk.com/church/pastors-or-leadership/ask-roger/does-the-apostle-paul-hate-women.html) the culture of the time.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.3.3. Con: Religion has a loud and powerful voice and claims to be divinely inspired and claims to define goodness, sin, and evil. If their morality simply reflects that of the time then it will have a tendency to popularize, and embed terrible trends and attitudes, thus hampering moral progress and holding society back.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.3.4. Con: If religious moral codes are deemed to transcend humans and be absolute in their own right \(because they emanate from a superior force\) then they should not be influenced by humanity's failures.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.3.5. Pro: The shocking thing would be if this weren't the case. Demagogy relies on instilling fear. That religion would not rely solely on creating a difference \(believers/infidels\) is hardly surprising.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.3.6. Con: By pointing to other differences that people already accept as bad they conflate belief/disbelief with those. That does not lessen the extent of their demagogy, it highlights it and shows that they were even worse, inventing a new thing to fear out of whole cloth.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.3.7. Con: Attitudes of the time are often the only overriding force to counter-act religious discrimination.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.3.8. Con: Attitudes of the time often change, but when adopted and codified into the doctrine of a religion they gain longevity in peoples minds for generations, eventually to the point where people no longer really understand what that attitude came from - they just adopt it - regardless of how toxic. The religion is then very stubborn/takes a long time on giving up on it, as to do so would be to admit fault
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.6. Con: This lies on the idea that what is considered a wrong thing now was wrong in the past. To determine if something is wrong, its reasons and effects have to be analyzed according to the historical moment.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.7. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.3.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.8. Pro: Religion rely on books written long ago, which are representative of their times. Relying too much to the word, and not the meaning leads to bigotry and ignorance
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.3. Pro: Some religions also contain scripture that has undoubtably made people less kind towards fellow humans. For example, violence in [Islam](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/violence.aspx) or [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_violence).
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.4. Pro: The origins of the "[Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule#Ancient_Egypt)" \(the principle of treating others as one would wish to be treated\) which is often attributed to Christianity are actually far older.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.5.3.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.5. Con: Intolerance of other groups is a sociological phenomenon, and religion is merely the form or pretense it may take. For any example of something bad done in the name of religion, you can find equal evils done in the name of non-religious ideology or even naked tribalism.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.5.1. Con: The more that separates us the easier it is to point fingers.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.5.2. Con: Not every evil done in the name of religion would have been replaced by one done for a secular reason. It's plausible that none of the evils done in the name of religion would have been replaced. We don't all walk around looking for reasons to kill each other.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.6. Pro: Research found that children from religious families are [less kind and more punitive](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/religious-children-less-altruistic-secular-kids-study) than those from non-religious households.
1.1.2.3.2.1.3.6.1. Pro: Children from households identifying as Christianity or Muslim were [less altruistic](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/religious-children-less-altruistic-secular-kids-study) than children from non-religious households. Moreover, older children \(with a longer exposure to religion" showed "the greatest negative relations”.
1.1.2.3.2.2. Con: Many religious teachings promote violence.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: Some [Buddhist](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/09/can-anyone-stop-burmas-hardline-buddhist-monks/538992/) and [Abrahamic](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/barcelona-attack-imam-police-investigation-house-explosion-location-islamist-terrorist-plot-las-a7905226.html) clergy commit violence toward their fellow man because they believe their religion requires it.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1. Con: The vast majority of practitioners and believers in these traditions are good people, and violent vocal minorities do not accurately reflect the majority of people.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con: It is not a question of whether it reflects that majority. It is a question of whether it reflects the actual messages of the texts and tenets.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Often because they believe the lies by preachers.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1.3. Con: The history of religions is not overloaded with tales of civilians who stand against preachers who are promoting violence but rather with people who stand with those preachers, rational thought set aside, or who stand aside in rational fear.
1.1.2.3.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.3.
1.1.2.3.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.
1.1.2.3.2.2.4. Pro: There are many passages within the main religious texts that exhort the adherents to kill all non-believers and that any who do not follow this "one true" religion are evil. Examples from the [Torah and Bible](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2015/01/22/yes-the-bible-does-say-to-kill-infidels/) and from the [Quran](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/violence.aspx).
1.1.2.3.2.2.4.1. Con: Historical texts are not written as a scientific paper, but most of them are written in a prose. A more right interpretation of these typical examples is a spiritual death. Nowadays, we attend to interpretate religious texts literally, however we find there true meaning between the lines; as is in life itself.
1.1.2.3.2.2.4.1.1. Con: It can hardly be claimed that one interpretation is 'right'. Religious scholars have been arguing over the right interpretations for thousands of years with no obvious conclusion. Therefore it is just as viable to claim that literal death is the right interpretation rather than spiritual death.
For example, violent texts  [in the Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_in_the_Quran) and in [the Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_violence).
1.1.2.3.2.2.4.1.2. Con: While some examples could be argued as meaning spiritual death, there are many others that extoll violence/murder be carried out on non-believers or those doing 'bad' deeds. It is hard to argue these are only meant to be taken as non-literal.
1.1.2.3.2.2.4.2. Pro: The [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam#Quran) condemns apostates to death if they do not quickly repent and rejoin.
1.1.2.3.2.2.5. Con: Fanaticism, religious or secular, in contrast to mere fervent belief, is identical in its underlying extremism, but most major beliefs themselves do not inherently require intolerance of other beliefs. In the absence of specifically intolerant suppositions, found in fanaticism, belief isn't intolerant - people are.
1.1.2.3.2.2.5.1. Con: Many beliefs are themselves inherently intolerant and require neither fanaticism nor extremism to cause problems.
1.1.2.3.2.2.5.1.1. Pro: The belief that [infidels and apostates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy#Contemporary_criminalization_of_apostasy) must die is the problem, there is not even need to take that to extremes to see the dangers.
1.1.2.3.2.2.5.1.2. Pro: The belief that abortion is murder is inherently intolerant of the view that it is not since murder is outlawed in modern society, if one truly believes that abortion is murder they cannot allow others to commit the act just because they have differing views.
1.1.2.3.2.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: The belief that abortion is murder makes you inherently intolerant of other people's choices, and justifies violence, as you believe that you are preventing substantial harm.
1.1.2.3.2.2.5.2. Con: Extremism is not a problem unless the fundamental beliefs are themselves flawed. A harmless belief taken to extremes is still harmless.
1.1.2.3.2.2.5.2.1. Pro: Extreme forms of love thy neighbor for example are not dangerous taken to any extreme conviction. It is other flawed beliefs that create the danger. Such as the belief that people who disagree should be made to agree or be killed.
1.1.2.3.2.2.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.5.1.1.
1.1.2.3.2.2.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.5.1.2.1.
1.1.2.3.2.2.5.2.4. Pro: [Janism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism) for example, the more extreme you are the less dangerous you are to other people because the fundamental belief is non-violence. You might pose a danger to yourself if you cannot move or eat anything but you are no danger to others.
1.1.2.3.2.2.6. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1.
1.1.2.3.2.3. Pro: Islamic [scriptures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_other_religions#Islamic_views_on_religious_pluralism) and teachings ask followers not to persecute other faiths.
1.1.2.3.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.4.
1.1.2.3.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.6.
1.1.2.3.2.5. Pro: Sikhism pledges to protect the weak.
1.1.2.3.2.6. Con: Holding these religious ideals does not stop the believers from committing atrocities in the name of and because of the religion. Contradictions and inconsistencies in the texts often leads people to justify atrocities.
1.1.2.3.2.6.1. Pro: Religious values of peace and loving one's neighbor did nothing to stop protestants and Catholics from slaughtering each other in the name of their religion and because of their religious differences. [Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wars_of_religion). [Recent violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles)
1.1.2.3.2.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.1.
1.1.2.3.2.7. Con: Conversely anything deemed immoral by a religion can lead to horrific persecution, especially when backed by religious fervour and a sense of moral righteousness.
1.1.2.3.2.7.1. Pro: These views cannot then be swayed by any form of argument, whether based on logic or science, as all viewpoints are considered inferior to the impervious tenets of the religion being questioned.
1.1.2.4. Pro: While religion may not be perfect it is more valuable to have the order that it brings than to risk the disorder that would be present in its absence.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: By claiming to have a direct connection to God and through a supporting morality, [monarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings) were able to convince their subjects to gladly do things against their own personal interest, but supporting the survival of the nation. This increased social density, which lead to economic and technological development.
1.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Concepts, like the [Divine Right of Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings), were important in establishing state authority.
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: Religion can provide particularly strong, rules-based, morals.
1.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Religion serves as a moral crutch for those people unable to recognise right from wrong
1.1.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: [Research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261834425_Crime_and_Religion_Assessing_the_Role_of_the_Faith_Factor) [supports](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261834488_Religion_and_Crime) that "religious involvement is a relevant protective and prosocial factor" in relation to crime.
1.1.2.4.2.1.2. Con: However, they don't adopt morals so much as dogma which may include morals but also may include homophobia, bigotry and other isms.
1.1.2.4.2.1.3. Con: Religion overrides objective analysis of right and wrong.
1.1.2.4.2.1.3.1. Con: This could be argued of anything which affects society since they skew the general perception of ideas.
1.1.2.4.2.1.4. Con: The people who have no internal moral compass such as people with [Antisocial Personality Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder) typically ignore rules and authority of any type and thus religion would have little to no effect on their behavior.
1.1.2.4.2.1.4.1. Pro: The punishment and ostracism from secular society, e.g. imprisonment, is arguable far greater than religious disapproval. It is therefore unlikely that religion will impact any individuals who are not already persuaded by secular laws.
1.1.2.4.2.1.4.2. Con: However, many of those will comply to avoid ostracism or to exploit the system
1.1.2.4.2.1.5. Pro: There are people who just aren't smart enough to tell the difference between right and wrong, particularly where an issue is some shade of grey or foul mix of black and white – for instance pro-choice vs pro-life. Some religions give these people an easy out.
1.1.2.4.2.1.5.1. Con: An easy out is not necessarily a good thing and is certainly worse than thinking things through. If someone is not intelligent enough to think things through they need guidance but this need not be religious guidance.
1.1.2.4.2.1.5.1.1. Con: There's not necessarily anyone there for that person to provide that guidance apart from the local church of their choice.
1.1.2.4.2.2. Pro: Strong moral codes are generally a good thing, unless they are carried to extremes.
1.1.2.4.2.2.1. Con: This depends on what those moral codes are. One need not be extreme to have negative consequences to thinking the LGBT community is immoral.
1.1.2.4.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.5.2.
1.1.2.4.2.3. Pro: Religion has inserted unmovable values in the humanity which has created respect between people.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1. Con: It may create respect between people of the same religion but a history of conflicts between religions shows that this respect does not extend to other faiths.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: Religions have been a prominent source of [conflict](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_war) and strife all over the world and through all ages.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Religions are abused as causes of war and conceal actual reasons for conflicts, which makes the resolution of these conflicts more difficult.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: Conflict is unavoidable, yet while conflicts about land ownerships or civil rights have a tangible outcome \(being able to live in a place, the abolition of slavery, etc.\) religious conflicts are based on a preventable dispute about ideas that, even after violence, have no substantial consequences.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Religious conflict has at times had immense ideological and sociological consequence. Christianity and Islam both completely upturned the societies they won over. The zoroastrian Mazdakites initiated what amounts to a socialist revolution 1300 years before Marx was born. Religious conflict is one of the major reasons North America was colonised as quickly as it was.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.3. Pro: Religion stands next to race, gender and sexual preference as a primary source of bigotry, which, even where it results in no specific and/or deliberate malevolent acts, has still blighted humanity, destroying relationships and potential relationships.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: In recent decades the favourite word which religious leaders use to suggest they're not bigots is a giveaway that that's exactly what many of them are: They claim they "tolerate", a word that's open to interpretation either as biased \(to placate their bigots\) or unbiased \(to placate everyone else\).
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Secular laws, governments, and constitutions have played a part in religions starting to use the word tolerate not only to allow a degree of interfaith cooperation to defend their rights as they see them, but also to suggest that they'll conform to secular laws and drop some antisocial practices used against infidels.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: Many potential marriages have been stopped dead by differences of religion.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.3.3. Pro: Religions are open to interpretation and yet they claim perfection. This leads to irrepressible conflict even among people who believe in the [same](http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_maco1.htm) particular [religion](https://www.cfr.org/news-releases/shia-revival-how-conflicts-within-islam-will-shape-future).
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.4. Pro: Religion is a perpetuator of conflict even if it is not the original source.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.4.1. Pro: United States Armed Forces personnel are [fighting](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/inside-americas-secret-war-with-isis-w501346) and dying in wars influenced by [religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_military_intervention_against_ISIL) zealots.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.4.2. Con: The idea of [ahimsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa) \("to do no harm"\) is a unique ideal in several Eastern religions, and is related to the idea of [pacifism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifism#Religious_attitudes), which is espoused by sects of almost every major religion today.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.4.2.1. Con: Religions can espouse pacifism in some situations and violence in others. Religion often contradicts itself and commands people to do wicked things. So simply promoting pacifism with one hand is not enough if if the other hand is a fist.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.4.3. Pro: In a globalized society, where borders and nation states are diminishing, religion is used by reaction to seperate people and religions are their allies, fearing to be abolished.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.4.3.1. Pro: For example, in secular Europe, that can be observed in the [tensions](https://www.euractiv.com/section/languages-culture/opinion/ethno-religious-conflict-in-europe-radicalisation-in-europe-s-muslim-communities/) between Muslim and non-muslim citizens.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Far right groups use [Christianity](https://theconversation.com/how-the-english-far-right-co-opted-christianity-and-why-its-crusade-shouldnt-be-ignored-82842) as a value to protect from Islamization in multi-faith countries.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.4.3.2. Pro: In secular [US](https://qz.com/1122117/what-does-it-mean-to-be-evangelical-how-the-right-wing-hijacked-christian-identity/), some people come together under the [Christian right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right) to support that “their understanding of the teachings of Christianity” is applied to politics and public policy.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.4.3.3. Pro: Nowadays [anti-Semitism](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/08/far-right-aims-take-over-european-union.html?gtm=bottom&gtm=bottom) in [Europe](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/anti-semitism-is-on-the-march-across-europe-1.3421116) is a [growing](https://cst.org.uk/news/blog/2018/07/26/cst-antisemitic-incidents-report-for-january-june-2018-published-today) [concern](https://www.thedailybeast.com/a-frightening-look-at-the-rise-of-anti-semitism-in-france).
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.4.3.4. Con: Bigotry, intolerance and an “[us vs. them](https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/nov/08/us-vs-them-the-sinister-techniques-of-othering-and-how-to-avoid-them)” mentality is commonly [used](https://www.salon.com/2015/04/24/us_vs_them_america_why_is_politics_so_nasty_because_we_treat_it_like_sports/), especially by certain politicians, to create exterior enemies and unite and strength their bases. Whereas it is religion, race, sexuality or migrant status, the problem is not the characteristic itself, but those who use them to divide and agitate.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.5. Pro: The variety of religions polarizes the faith of human beings, confronting each other. Moral values and love are universal and religion only divides morality by justifying any conflict between the goodwill of the believers.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.5.1. Con: Moral values and love are in no way shape or form universal. One only has to look at civilizations across the world and throughout history to find that tribalism and genocide of outsiders is far more universal than any such ideals, and to find morality differs radically based on the culture you look at.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6. Pro: Religion is man-made. It is a set of rules and ways of praising, communicating, believing the so called God, that exists and grows affected by cultures and more. Which in the process can crash between cultures, ideologies, and history. If there's no religion nor God, but people strive to work in harmony and compassion, side by side, things will be better and more peaceful.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.1. Pro: One way forward in conflicts such as Israel-Palestine would be for both sides to adopt atheism. This would remove the need to fight for religious views.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2. Con: Humans are innately self-interested, and this naturally leads to competition and conflict between people. Religion is an effective tool for organizing human behavior around principles beyond their mere self-interest. Admittedly, evil leaders can lead their followers astray, but good or decent church leaders encourage and promote selfless behavior in their followers to an extent that would be absent if we did away with religion.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1. Con: The selfless behavior promoted is often contingent on following what the religion thinks is best for people which is sometimes very bad.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: Religion often encourages [gay conversion therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy) as what is best for homosexuals.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.2. Pro: The [beheading of homosexuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_in_Islam) is sometimes seen as what is best.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3. Pro: Religions' protest against safe sex is causing an epidemic.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.1. Con: There is more than the Catholic Church out there. Other churches promote safe sex. Generally speaking for a church the safest sex would be inside the bonds marriage and faithfulness in marriage.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.2. Con: Most religions advocate for abstinence outside of marriage because sex with multiple partners is never 100% safe.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.2.1. Con: Sex with multiple partners is safer with a condom than without it.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.2.2. Con: Many young people [believe](https://f1000.com/prime/1325990) oral sex and genital stimulation to be 'abstinent practices', however, they are still unsafe practices without the use of prophylaxis.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.2.3. Con: Having more sexual partners may provide a variety of benefits for an individual.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Having more sexual partners may expand people's horizons about sex as well as giving them a better comparison between what good or bad sex is, since they have something to compare it with.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.2.3.2. Pro: Having more sexual partners [could possibly](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20121015/Females-having-multiple-sexual-partners-may-be-more-fertile.aspx) increase the fertility of women.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.2.4. Con: [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15082413) shows that religious individuals are less likely to use condoms when they do engage in [risky sexual behavior](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2941704/#R21) \(extramarital sex, for example\), thus increasing risk of infection.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.2.4.1. Con: It is not religion that causes risky sexual behavior in the first place. Religion often denounces such behavior, and as such, may lead to a lower rate of infidelity, thus reducing overall danger.
Research from the University of Nevada in Las Vegas states, "Permissive attitudes toward infidelity increase a couple’s risk and are more likely to occur in liberally minded individuals with low religiosity... [\(p. 8\)](http://fifes2.faculty.unlv.edu//pdf/Infidelity%20and%20Extramarital%20Sex.pdf)"
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.2.5. Con: This religiously inspired approach ignores fundamental human behaviors that can, and more often than not, do transcend any indoctrinated beliefs of the conscious mind, no matter how deeply ingrained. And when that drive for intimacy does rise above \(what the rational mind ultimately considers to be flaky\) indoctrination, it's unwise to be uninformed and unprepared to protect against disease and unwanted pregnancy.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.2.6. Con: Understanding one's sexual compatibility with the person you would consider marrying is an important aspect of ultimately having a happy, healthy, long lasting, and faithful marriage.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.2.6.1. Pro: There is [evidence](http://journal-archieves25.webs.com/134-147.pdf) that sex education can improve the quality of marriage, indicating that the quality of sex is important to many people's experience of marriage.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.3. Pro: In Central Africa where the Catholic Church keeps advocating against condom use, the devastating HIV and AIDS epidemic is [killing](https://www.salon.com/2015/11/30/catholic_dogmas_are_killing_people_in_africa/) people.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.3.1. Pro: In Kenya, around 6% percent of the population between the ages of 15 and 49 are [HIV positive](https://www.salon.com/2015/11/30/catholic_dogmas_are_killing_people_in_africa/), in Uganda, close to 8% and in Zambia, 13.5 % of the adult population live with HIV.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.2.4.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.7. Con: Religion can be a catalyst for a [global peace process](https://thesustainabilityreader.com/2017/12/20/religion-as-a-catalyst-for-a-peace-global-process/).
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.7.1. Con: The basis of religion is being right over other religious or non-religious beliefs. This is divisive at its core, so it cannot be a catalyst for peace.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.8. Con: Religions have been used as an excuse for conflict. If religions didn't exist, other excuses would arise by the elite.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.8.1. Pro: Uniting people is the source of wars. The bloody wars are possible when rulers of some union of people start to see the lives of its people as an asset that could be sacrificed for other goals. Religion is not the only factor creating unity. Unnecessary conflicts between unions or individuals happen every time they fight with no gains and losses on both sides purely for emotional reasons, false convictions or \(only in case of unions\) personal gains of the decision maker.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.8.1.1. Con: If it is to be assumed that uniting people is the source of war and that religion unites people in a way that causes strife, then whether or not religion is the only cause is irrelevant to the point that religion would be an unnecessary cause and that without it the world would have less war and strife.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.8.2. Pro: Atrocities can and have been committed in the name of many things: from race, nationality, ethnicity, political orientation, materialistic gain, to football clubs. Anything people can rally under can and has been used to commit atrocities. Singling out religion is a logical fallacy, not to mention hypocritical.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.8.2.1. Con: Ethnicity, race cannot be chosen or changed and initial nationality is also not chosen. Religion can be changed and is unnecessary and thus is different from the others in that it is a cause of atrocities that could be entirely avoided.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.8.3. Pro: Not just the elite. In truth, the populace likes to have an enemy and then an enemy defeated.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.8.4. Con: Perhaps those excuses would be more based in reality.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.8.5. Con: Religion is more than just an excuse religion was a direct cause for many conflicts throughout history. The [crusades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades) and the wars between [protestants and Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wars_of_religion) may have had some influencing political factors but religion played a much larger role than just an excuse. [Pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom) against Jews and [Massacres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Wars_of_Religion) of protestants by Catholics and visa versa were also common and caused by religious division and hatred.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.9. Con: While religion is often blamed as the primary source of most historical conflicts, research shows that there are multiple factors in play, more often than not, secular and political.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.9.1. Pro: Instances of violence for which religion has been blamed cannot be separated from just as likely secular causes of the same violence. As was outlined in William T Cavanaugh's 2009 book "[The Myth of Religious Violence](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195385045.001.0001/acprof-9780195385045-chapter-2)" published by Oxford University Press.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.9.2. Pro: [Historians](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-alan-lurie/is-religion-the-cause-of-_b_1400766.html) Phillips and Axelrod document the history of recorded warfare, and from their list of 1,763 wars only 123 have been classified to involve a religious cause. Religion isn’t the problem.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.9.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.2.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.9.3. Con: While the primary source of historical conflicts might be political or economical, religion is often used to gather mass consent around particular political leaders, often moving the masses to commit atrocities.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.9.4. Con: It might be simplistic to pretend to separate religion from political, economical or other secular interests. The fact that there are many factors at play in historical conflicts does not exclude religion from being one of the factors contributing to war.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.9.4.1. Pro: Religion is articulated with other economic, social and cultural factors in order to exacerbate feelings of group chauvinism that are moved against the perceived deviant other.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.10. Con: The goal of all conflicts is to gain power. Religion itself may be just a tool, not the source motivation.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.10.1. Con: Conflicts are often more complicated than a simple lust for power. The desire for power over a specific group of people can be itself motivated by things such as religion or bigotry.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.10.2. Con: A tool can be part of the problem and even a cause. If one gets aggravated while holding a gun it may end much differently than if they were unarmed. Similarly religion may cause completely avoidable conflicts due to the beliefs the adherents hold.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.11. Pro: Some religions teach their followers that they should [seek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses#Evangelism) to [convert](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28166192) everyone else to their religion, which can provoke conflict.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12. Con: Religions have also provided a source of transnational and ethnic solidarity.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.1. Con: This transnational and ethnic solidarity \(which we can also call tribalism\) is never upheld peacefully. Instead it requires the exact animosity towards the other tribe, which this is arguing against.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.2. Con: This solidarity is only within those within the religion, thus it amounts to another division. For instance where before we may have had two countries, say Blebria and Contabra, now we have religious Blebrians, atheist Blebrians, religious Contabrans and atheist Contabrans. That amounts to 6 divisions where we had only nationalism, and some of those divisions are more severe, for instance between the religious Blebrians and the atheist Contabrans.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.3. Pro: While there are examples of religious intolerance, there are also examples of religion tolerance when several faiths have coexisted peacefully.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.3.1. Pro: There are [numerous examples](http://aboutislam.net/reading-islam/research-studies/religious-tolerance-muslim-history/) from throughout this history of Islam of tolerance being shown to other faiths.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.3.1.1. Con: The quoted examples include the way in which Muslims entered Jerusalem peacefully, yet it also contrasts that with the slaughter perpetrated by [Crusaders](http://aboutislam.net/reading-islam/research-studies/religious-tolerance-muslim-history/) in [1099](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_\(1099\)). Therefore, while one religion was peaceful in that case, another one was far from peaceful.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.3.1.1.1. Pro: [Crusaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_\(1099\)) killed many Muslims and Jews or allowed them to live as long as they left the city.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.3.1.2. Con: While in the [Caliphate of Córdoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate_of_C%C3%B3rdoba) different religions coexisted, that society was very stratified. Ethnic Arabs were at the top of the social hierarchy, higher than Jews and Christians, who had to pay a tax supporting wars against Christian kingdoms in the north of Spain.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.3.1.2.1. Pro: The peaceful coexistence between Muslims and Christians in Spain was stopped by the [Reconquista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista#Concept_and_duration), “a continuous phenomenon by which the Christian Iberian kingdoms opposed and conquered the Muslim kingdoms” for about 780 years, culminating in 1492.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Even after 1492, in Spain, descendants of Muslims were subjected to expulsions and mass persecution, the point that “indigenous Islam is considered to have been [extinguished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus) in Spain”.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.3.2. Con: Since religion has been often a source of conflict among groups, the fact that in some cases different faiths and denominations have been able to coexist, does not detract from the fact that in the same number of cases, if not more, they have not been able to do so.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.3.3. Con: Long periods of harmony have been used an excuse for wrongdoing for as long as there's been wrongdoing. "She's a pillar of the community" "It's his first offence" "She runs a charity" "He employs thousands of people". They don't mean anything. The victim is still dead, ostracized or mutilated.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.3.4. Con: There's no rehabilitation for religions—their tenets don't change.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.3.4.1. Pro: Meanwhile religious fuelled malfeasance by members is condoned, forgiven, or ignored as an outlier.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.3.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.3.5. Con: Tolerance is claimed to take the high ground. Not because the religion doesn't believe that it's better. It's lipstick on a pig. Laws are obeyed only where the authorities have the power to implement the laws. Where religion can get away with stuff it tries, because it believes it's right.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.12.3.5.1. Pro: For instance numerous unconstitutional US state laws against [LGBTQ](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/19/united-states-state-laws-threaten-lgbt-equality) and [women's](https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-abortion-laws-stand-45-years-roe-wade/story?id=52462955) rights.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13. Con: The tribal nature of humans has been the biggest source of conflict.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1. Con: Historically religion has been functional in fostering social bonds and in controlling selfship impulses. That way it facilitated sociality within social groups. At the same time, it has always intensified social conflicts between groups. The ideas of enlightenment can and do replace religion's adaptive functions and at the same show the path to true cosmopolitanism.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1. Pro: Different religious beliefs and even interpretations have fueled a profound divide between humans for centuries.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.1. Pro: For instance, [Sunni and Shia](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-16047709).
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.2. Pro: Religions focus too much on their differences thus making it difficult to have a common understanding with one another.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3. Con: Religious beliefs/interpretations have been responsible for the strengthening of communities and social bonds, reducing the levels of division within in-groups/those with similar beliefs. These common ideals and values have knit people together for centuries.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1. Con: They have also done the exact opposite, driving people away who have different views or religious beliefs. It is a tribal mentality that can be seen in any number of groups from football teams, nationalities, political parties etc etc
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Religion is a form of tribality.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Religion has been used as an excuse to ostracise atheists and people of other faiths.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Religion creates the illusion that people can only be considered good if they belong to a religious denomination, therefore religion discriminates.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.2. Con: Atheism has been used to [ostracise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians) those with religious beliefs.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: Several communist countries that promoted atheism persecuted and marginalized those with religious beliefs.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Christians were persecuted in the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Soviet_Union).
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: In comunist [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution), "religion was looked upon as a means of hostile foreign infiltration, as well as an instrument of the ruling class".
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Christians were also persecuted throughout the whole [Eastern Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Eastern_Bloc#German_Democratic_Republic) \(Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Albania, Czechoslovakia, East Germany\).
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.4.2.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.4. Pro: Throughout history religious conflicts have lead to [forced conversions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_conversion).
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.4.1. Con: Forced conversion is an example of coercion, something that exists independently of religion.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.5. Pro: In some occasions, religion is only charitable or helps those who believe.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.5.1. Pro: Religion only organises charity for those they believe [deserve](https://www.aclu.org/issues/religious-liberty/using-religion-discriminate/end-use-religion-discriminate) it. Numerous indictments of those like the [Salvation Army](https://www.advocate.com/religion/2017/12/08/salvation-army-we-meet-human-need-without-discrimination) refusing to help people because they were LGBT, or even because they were Atheist.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.5.1.1. Con: The practices and policies of particular religious organizations or people of religion cannot be used as evidence against all religions. Particular religions should be judged based on what they teach, not on how people who espouse the religions do or do not follow the teachings.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.5.2. Pro: Caritas, one of the largest's world humanitarian organizations, asked members in Vietnam to combine charity with [evangelization](https://www.ucanews.com/news/caritas-workers-asked-to-combine-charity-with-evangelization/80125).

1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.2. Con: Deeming people of the same religion as not following the imposed prescriptions strictly enough often served as casus belli, even when the real motives were of different kind. Such sort of war justification was e.g. often practiced by [Saladin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin).

1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.7. Pro: For instance, [The Great Schism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_Schism) and subsequent hatred between the Western and the Eastern churches.

1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.10. Pro: Even today religion has contributing to much [violence and problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict#Religious_aspects_of_the_conflict) in the middle east.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.11. Pro: Religion has been used throughout history to separate humanity into distinct camps. For example, in the [separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India) of India and Pakistan in 1947.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.12. Con: Division does not imply harm
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.12.1. Con: [Recent study](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/07/artificial-intelligence-religion-atheism/565076/) has shown that, if a society is religiously divided in two major denominations and the proportion of the minority is greater than 30% of the population, large-scale religion-based conflicts are likely to happen.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.12.2. Con: When that division often involves war, violence and conflict, it does indeed imply harm.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.12.2.1. Pro: The [Crusades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades) added to hatred among Christians, Jews, and Muslims as they waged war for their holy lands.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.12.3. Con: Protestants and Catholics waged several [wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wars_of_religion) against each other in Europe despite both being Christian.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13. Pro: The Catholic church used the [Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition#Definition_and_purpose) to prosecute anyone who espoused  views deemed as heretic \(for example, some scientific ideas\) convicting people to different sentences, including death by burning.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13.1. Con: The [Spanish Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition) is a perfect example of men, in this case the monarchy, defying clear religious doctrine for malicious self interests. It is an example of men abusing authority, not of actual religion abusing people. "Love your neighbor as yourself." Follow Christ, not men falsely claiming to represent Him.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13.1.1. Con: Only the [Spanish Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition) operated completely under the royal Christian authority \(though staffed by clergy\), yet many sentences dictated during Inquisition trials were made within the [judicial system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition#Roman_Inquisition) of the Roman Catholic Church.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13.1.2. Con: If organized religions are lead by men, and men are bound to malicious self interests, then it is likely that religions often fall prey to nefarious actions against fellow men.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13.1.2.1. Pro: Violence is not what religion is about. Even if you meet a so called 'infidel', violence is not the way to treat a human being.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13.2. Pro: Cecco d'Ascoli  was the first university scholar [burned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecco_d%27Ascoli) by the Inquisition.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13.3. Con: One incident, in one branch of Christianity, in a small period of time, is not representative for all religion.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13.3.1. Con: The [Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition#Definition_and_purpose), in different forms, lasted from the 12th century to the 19th century, in various territories and affecting a branch of Christianity that today [represents](https://www.livescience.com/27244-the-world-s-catholic-population-infographic.html) 1.1 billion people, 50% of Christians around the globe and 16% of the world's population.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13.4. Pro: Italian [Giordano Bruno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno) was tortured and killed by the church of Rome for having introduced the concept of infinity of the universe, the multiplicity of the worlds, and the motion of the Earth respect to the sun.

1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.2. Pro: The Cult of Reason, an early atheist group, was responsible for [extreme violence against christians](http://www.sullivan-county.com/identity/shanda.htm), and communist nations have frequently featured religious genocides. This is evidence that violence against other cultures is not a distinct facet of religion, but a [factor of human psychology](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/blog/philosophy-dispatches/201112/dehumanization-genocide-and-the-psychology-indifference-0%3famp).
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.2.1. Con: The fact that violence has been committed out of a religious context doesn't make violence in a religious context okay.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.2.2. Con: In fact, extremist atheism could be considered a form of religion itself. Agnostic atheism is being non-religious.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3. Pro: Secular causes have cause [several times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_war) as many war deaths throughout [history](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-alan-lurie/is-religion-the-cause-of-_b_1400766.html).
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.1. Pro: The Soviet Union, an officially anti-religious nation, functionally killed tens of millions of people due to abuse of power; this was fueled by an ideology unrelated to religious ideology. Any ideology can be harmful, not exclusively a religious one.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.1.1. Con: Soviet ideology was pretty much an organized religion: it had good analogs of [clergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_commissar), [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism), prophets, scriptures, [holy relics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin%27s_Mausoleum), [chiliastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennialism) [paradise](http://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/DC/Acn1062.0001.9976.000.010.Jul1962.6/Acn1062.0001.9976.000.010.Jul1962.6.pdf), inquisition, at times even [baptism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octobering). It only failed deities and afterlife, but not every religion does have them both.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2. Pro: People have been led to do terrible things outside of religion. Some of the greatest atrocities in history had no religious motivation. For example: the [Great Leap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward) and the outbreak of [World War II](https://www.historyonthenet.com/world-war-two-causes/).
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1. Pro: In modern times by far the greatest source of conflict has been totalitarian political ideologies, which include not just militant imperialism, Marxism, and fascism, but also totalitarian Islamism, which is no mere religion.  Neglecting the mass suffering & oppression, just the death toll of totalitarianism from war, famine, & genocide since the early 20th century is in the hundreds of millions. There is nothing comparable perpetrated by religious organizations outside of said totalitarianism.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1. Pro: The religions claimed to have waged atrocities were either theocracies or defacto government authorities. One might say it is governmental bodies that incite mass atrocity and not religion. For example,  [Logistics of the crusades](http://dcc.newberry.org/collections/the-crusades-motivations-administration-and-cultural-influence), [Classical and Mixed Sharia Systems](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Application_of_Islamic_law_by_country), [Catholic Missions](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Catholic_Church_in_Latin_America)
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1. Con: One might say in those cases that religion seized political authority and used to it to incite mass atrocity. In such a view governmental bodies would simply be a tool religions can use to do terrible things.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Religion cultivates political power.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The success of farming depends on the climate and size of land. At the point of saturation, if lands can not be conquered, then the minds can be conquered instead because it accumulates wealth and creates committed soldiers to defend a faith.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Not if the religion in question actively argues against the use of power. If that religion is used to cultivate political power anyway, the religion is subverted, not the source.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Religion has also fought against the political establishment.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Jesus Christ was actually breaking social [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilate's_court).
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Even in countries like the USA with religious freedoms, there are religions that are frowned upon, if not flat out censored. The recent actions by the Temple of Satan to demonstrate the stranglehold that Christianity has had in the USA, up to and including distributing religious propaganda in schools, are an example of this.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: Legislative restrictions may be imposed upon citizens due to religious principles, regardless if those citizens share those values or not.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: Religion is  opposing many contemporary laws.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Legalization of some [Drugs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_drugs), legalization of [Gay marriage](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_religion), legalization of [Abortion](http://churchandstate.org.uk/2015/12/how-religion-is-making-overpopulation-worse/), are some examples of laws that have traditionally been or are currently contested by religious people.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.2. Con: Without resorting to political order, a Religion cannot force its citizens to adopt a set or rules. It may only suggest a moral code by which to live.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.2.1. Con: The way a political order forces citizens to follow rules is by threat of consequences. Religions have done the same thing with their own threats and consequences. Religions have used excommunication, inquisitions, pogroms, and burning at the steak to enforce their rules and values.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.2.2. Con: In the past and even nowadays, religious authorities and religious groups have often pressured legislators to sanction laws according to their beliefs
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.2.2.1. Con: Everyone pressures their legislators to sanctions laws according to their opinions and beliefs, this is neither a bad thing nor unique to religion. It's simply how \(most\) western governments work.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.2.2.1.1. Con: While lobbying in general is common in most places secularism and separation of [church and state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state) is also valued in many modern societies.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.2.2.1.2. Con: In the USA churches can [lose their tax exemption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Amendment) if they endorse political candidates because it is recognized that religion is not something that should be influencing government the same way as everything else.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.3. Pro: Personal freedoms are often restricted by laws such as Kashrut or Sharia.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.3.1. Con: Personal freedom may not be the highest value. For example, conservatives usually prioritize personal responsibility over freedom.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.4. Pro: Religious laws are being created even nowadays, the most numerous of which are probably the [anti-LGBT ones in the US](https://www.aclu.org/other/legislation-affecting-lgbt-rights-across-country).

1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.7. Pro: Organized religions have often sided with elites, legitimating or enhancing their power.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.7.1. Pro: In previous times monarchs derived the right to rule directly from the [will of God.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings)
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.7.1.1. Pro: Protestant rulers often headed their own state churches.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Until [2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Norway#State_and_church) the constitutional head of [the Church of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Norway) was the King of Norway.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.7.1.1.2. Pro: Sweden funded the Church of Sweden, its own national church in 1477: royals and elected officials could only profess this faith. Although laws gradually allowed religious freedom, it was not until 1951 that nationals could leave the Church without having to be part of another congregation, and it was not until 2000 that the State and the Church were formally separated \([Jänterä-Jareborg, p. 672](https://www.iclrs.org/content/blurb/files/Sweden.1.pdf)\).
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.7.1.2. Pro: Roman Catholic rulers had their legitimacy supported by the [Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relations_between_the_Catholic_Church_and_the_state#The_papacy_and_the_Divine_Right_of_Kings).
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.8. Pro: Over the course of history the papacy has held tremendous political power in various forms.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.8.1. Pro: The papacy was head of the [Papal States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States)
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.8.2. Pro: The Pope participated in many coronations in Europe throughout history.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.9. Pro: Religions have not developed in isolation, they have reflected cultural norms and enshrined them in a way that makes it harder to shift them. Their privilege, and the privileges they make into doctrines create and perpetuate inequality
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.2. Con: If a totalitarian regime is also a religious one or atrocities are committed in the name of religion or because of it then religion cannot simply be separated from the regime and absolved of all blame.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.3. Con: When marching into battle, the king's [flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Christian_flags) was mostly immediately followed by the flag of the [religious](http://www.larsdatter.com/banners.htm) belief of the king.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.4.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3. Pro: During the 20th century, the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_Communist_regimes) ended killing around 20 million of their own people, despite the fact it was a secular society.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.1. Con: The fact that secular societies have also committed atrocities doesn't exonerate or ameliorate the atrocities committed in the name of religion.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.2. Con: Any dictatorship has been \(and will be\) bad. This regardless of religious or secular "ism" claimed by the dictator. The dictator doesn't really care about any other "ism" than his \(not her\) ego-ISM and strive for more power.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.1.1.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.4. Con: [Ad Stalinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-baiting). Not every secular government or ideology was responsible for mass murders, not every religious government or ideology was irresponsible for mass murders.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5. Con: This does not mean religion would have stopped the atrocity or that the atrocity was due to the lack of religion.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1. Con: What it does mean is that lack of religion is not correlated with success \(and conversely, religion is not correlated with lack of success\)
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1. Pro: There has not been a truly secular society until recently. The data set simply isn't big enough to determine if it is the secularization of society that allowed them to be more successful.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1. Con: Even if it currently is impossible to determine if increased secularization causes more development, empirical evidence seems to support that more development does cause religiosity to decline.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Research points that religious belief declines in [economically developed countries](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1069397111402465) with “greater existential security, including income security \(income equality and redistribution via welfare states\) and improved health”.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Among those more [educated](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/04/26/in-america-does-more-education-equal-less-religion/), there is a tendency to have higher levels of [non belief](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201005/why-atheism-will-replace-religion) or to, at least, hold religious beliefs with less certainty.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Some studies show a negative correlation between [intelligence](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1088868313497266?journalCode=psra) and religiosity, possibly explained by the fact that intelligent people are less likely to conform to dogma and tend to adopt a [analytic](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6080/493) way of thinking.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: These studies may not take into account other variables. Since many positive social conditions \(education, urbanization, income, etc.\) also happen to be correlated with loss of religion, the link could be explained more by those causes than by intelligence and religion themselves.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Correlation does not indicate causation. Education could just as easily be structured in a way that attracts non-religious people.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Statistics show that [birth rates decrease](https://www.forbes.com/sites/currentevents/2012/10/16/warning-bell-for-developed-countries-declining-birth-rates/#7ba9e8963641) to dangerous levels in those same countries. Perhaps a decline in religious belief is not a good thing.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: As scientific knowledge allows to reduce [uncertainty](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/nigel-barber/why-atheism-to-replace-re_b_903653.html), in [democracies](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201005/why-atheism-will-replace-religion) with strong economies and welfare provisions, people find less need to deal with the uncertainty of the future through religion.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4. Con: The cause of this trend could be that religion is less needed in economically developed countries; not that religion stagnates economic growth. Wealthy, comfortable people have little use for a theology that promises rewards in the afterlife. The impoverished, however, may find significant value in religious teachings telling them that human value is not measured by money, and that rewards await them in heaven for living a good life on earth.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Following that logic, religion can then make those impoverished endure the worst situations and not strive to do better in exchange for the promise of a possible better afterlife.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Giving food to a starving person also risks encouraging complacency, yet few would argue that doing so is immoral.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: While an individual action that helps someone in a time of need is not immoral, in a macro level, making people dependent on help and charity deprives them of striving for social mobility, which is indeed criticizable.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Charity, for example, often endorses inequality instead of fixing its roots.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: [Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X16301115) suggests that income inequality may trigger human empathy and thus it is positively associated with the probability to actively participate in charitable organizations.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Charity](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/charity-no-substitute-for-action-on-inequality-1.556405) validates injustices and it is not an effective response to economic inequality.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Charity is subjective and creates categories: those deserving of it and those who do not.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Some charities give to those in need but do [very little](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Fighting-Income-Inequality/153773) in fighting for policy changes like increased minimum wages or other welfare policies.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: "Doom and gloom predictions" and apocalyptic ideas "prevalent in Christian fundamentalism, may also help some people attribute a higher purpose to their [suffering](https://thehumanist.com/news/national/why-are-the-poor-more-religious)" and see it as part of God's plan, instead of striving to do better.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.2. Con: If religion is less necessary in developed and stable countries, it can be argued that the functions religion provides can be achieved by other systems, and thus its contributions may not really be necessary.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.2.1. Con: However, the issue is not about necessity but whether religion is "good" for humanity.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.2.2. Pro: Recent [research](https://www.newsweek.com/less-religious-countries-more-prosperous-study-says-1032778) has found that countries that become more tolerant and [secular](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/secular-countries-may-have-more-economic-growth-study/articleshow/65051994.cms) are more likely to become wealthier and economically stronger.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: [Studies](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/secular-countries-may-have-more-economic-growth-study/articleshow/65051994.cms) suggest that secularisation precedes economic development. Even if the causal link is not completely established, the idea that it is economic developement what leads to secularization has been ruled out.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.2.3. Con: There are probably ways to provide the same types of goods offered by religion, and that the costs associated may be less. But in a utilitarian sense, the mental health benefits offered by religion in impoverished areas may from some perspectives outweigh any tendency towards extremism created in a subset of those populations.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.2.3.1. Pro: [Research](https://thehumanist.com/news/national/why-are-the-poor-more-religious) suggests that "in places without strong social safety nets to provide people with opportunities for upward mobility, people are more likely to rely on religion for comfort".
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: That is not necessarily good: more safety nets and better opportunities could probably be more helpful to those in impoverished areas.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.2.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.1.2.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.2.3.1.3. Pro: Additionally, in places "with little to no social supports, the local [church](https://thehumanist.com/news/national/why-are-the-poor-more-religious) may provide for people’s basic needs through free childcare programs, food pantries, and clothing drives".
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.2.3.1.3.1. Con: Since religion may condition help to those who belief and are part of a group, social services would be better provided by the community itself through the state.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.2.2.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.4. Pro: Religion helps to sublimate the grudges and anger that results from inequality.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Religious beliefs — notably belief in hell, heaven, and an afterlife — tend to increase [economic growth](https://www.hoover.org/research/religion-and-economic-development). Religious beliefs are found to "raise productivity by fostering individual traits such as honesty, work ethic, and thrift".
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Maybe \(if this is true\) the work ethic increases to make up for giving too much to the collection tray/box or because for the N people in a church N-1 are productive members of society. One just talks and consumes.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.2.2. Con: The quoted article is high on theory but has zero numbers. It states that it's speculating and raising the question, not drawing the conclusion. It is not support, but elaboration.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.2.3. Con: Linked article is pointing to Max Weber theory in "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism". This theory doens't confirm the thesis that religion is beneficial for economy.  First of all this book is really ancient stuff without real data. Second - this book states that only protestantism was beneficial for economy. This book was written as a critics of Marx theory and was biased.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.2.4. Con: The same source points out also that "the effect of greater religious participation is to reduce economic growth". The positive relationship described is dependent on "believing relative to belonging \(attending\)", not on religious belief itself.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.2.5. Con: At the cost of freedom: a workforce that lives under the threat of "hell" or some equivalent adverse effect which is unfounded.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.2. Con: Though religion may be the foundation of many civilizations, increased economic development, education and urbanization lead countries to be more [secular](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/nigel-barber/why-atheism-to-replace-re_b_903653.html).
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: The world’s [most religious](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/12/23/americans-are-in-the-middle-of-the-pack-globally-when-it-comes-to-importance-of-religion/) countries are in very low positions in the [Human Development Index](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2016_human_development_report.pdf), while the least religious countries are "very high" or "high" in the same index.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Statistics](http://news.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx) suggest some level of correlation between religiosity and lower human development rates.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.2.2.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.2.1.2. Con: The countries that are very high in the index got there through an extended period of Christian culture. Recent decline in Christian belief has come through materialism, consumerism, individualism, so they are living off spiritual capital in a sense.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution) started and took pace in a period of [religious skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment), with less religiously restrictive countries decisively outperforming the more religious ones.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: Correlation without causation. Arguably gun powder had a more profound effect on the economic well being of many countries since it enabled them to colonize other parts of the world. The industrial revolution had an even higher impact Christianity simply had nothing to do with their economic success.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.2.1.2.3. Con: Possibly an effect rather than a cause. Christian countries were fairly hard on others for significant periods, for instance the [Crusades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades), the [Spanish Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition).

1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.4. Con: Secular war is a terrible thing and so is religious war. There being more secular wars does not diminish the atrociousness of religious war. That is still millions of people who should not have been killed and this does not even count all the killings done in the name of religion outside of wars such as pograms, genocide, religious massacres, sacrifices or people dying of STDs because the churches preach against the use of condoms.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.5. Con: Secular wars are fought over real things like resources, land, revenge, and water. Religion is fought over made up gods which makes the losses from religious wars more pointless.

1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.6. Con: Other wars being worse doesn't mean that religious wars were a good thing to humanity.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.7. Con: False dilemma. Most of societies throughout history were religious, yet made wars for secular causes.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.8. Con: Sampling bias. Absolute numbers of casualties are not representative because of a rapid world population growth coupled with increasing secularization since the XVIII century. One needs per capita numbers, which are not present.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.9. Con: Even today, in the US military, Chaplains will say a prayer for soldiers going into battle. Separating secular and religious conflicts is not an easy task.

1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.6. Con: Religion is an extra cause that can exacerbate conflict arising from tribal nature and add its own conflict on top of that. Thus making a negative contribution to the society.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.6.1. Pro: Religion creates a climate where it is easy to promote hatred, racism, homophobia and other forms of discrimination to people who have never been encouraged to think outside their patterns or to question what is being taught to them.

1.1.2.4.2.3.1.2. Pro: Historically most religions have spread a message of love and respect for others so long as they adhere to the same religion. The idea of tolerance has been taken up by some religions since crusades, stonings, and burning witches went out of style, but tolerance implies superiority, which implies a lack of respect.
1.1.2.4.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.1.
1.1.2.4.2.5. Con: Religion is a way to outsource moral codes. Whoever controls the religion, controls the morals of a given society, and that is too much power to have.
1.1.2.4.2.5.1. Pro: Religion has created moral codes with features that are clearly not morals but merely tenets designed to control.
1.1.2.4.2.5.1.1. Pro: In Christianity, for [example](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A3-5&version=KJV): "Thou shalt have no other gods before me".
1.1.2.4.2.5.1.2. Pro: In Christianity, for [example](http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm): "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image."
1.1.2.4.2.5.1.3. Pro: In Christianity, for example, the [commandment](http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm) "Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain."
1.1.2.4.2.5.1.4. Pro: For example, islamic [modesty](http://islam.ru/en/content/story/dress-code-muslim-women) and dress code rules.
1.1.2.4.2.5.1.5. Con: Control is being used in a pejorative sense here.  Self-control is not a bad thing; it is a way in which societies become cohesive and peaceful places to live.  So they are not merely tenets designed to control - they are mechanisms to help us live in tolerance an peace.
1.1.2.4.2.5.1.5.1. Con: Religious tenets may help live in peace those who adhere to them. If not, they can be a source of persecution, coercion and unhappiness.
1.1.2.4.2.5.1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.
1.1.2.4.2.5.1.5.1.2. Pro: Religion has caused the death of many innocents who were thought to be witches, pagan, heretic, or just for ritual and punitive sacrifices.
1.1.2.4.2.5.1.5.1.2.1. Con: It wasn't caused by religion, but by people who were fanatics, they would have killed these people or others in the name of another values as well.
1.1.2.4.2.5.1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: Leviticus 20:27 “ ‘A man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads.’ ” Religion literally commands its followers to put these people to death it is therefore entirely religions fault.
1.1.2.4.2.5.1.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.
1.1.2.4.2.5.2. Pro: When people claim to speak for God, abuse is bound to happen.
1.1.2.4.2.6. Con: Whether strong rule based morals is a good thing or not is entirely dependent on the rules and often times religion adds rather repulsive rules that are harmful to society.

1.1.2.4.2.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.2.
1.1.2.4.2.7. Con: By including a few common sense morals in their tenets they camouflage all the other stuff that nobody should have to adhere to or risk eternal damnation, ostracism, stoning, being burnt at the stake…
1.1.2.4.2.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.6.
1.1.2.4.2.9. Pro: Without religion there would be no fear of punishment in afterlife. So many near the end of their life may commit atrocities.
1.1.2.4.2.9.1. Pro: In [criminality](https://nij.gov/five-things/pages/deterrence.aspx) research, for example, the certainty or the increased perception of being caught deters crime.
1.1.2.4.2.9.1.1. Con: However, increasing the severity of [punishment](https://nij.gov/five-things/pages/deterrence.aspx), does little to deter crime.
1.1.2.4.2.9.2. Con: In most developed countries the number of religious believers is decreasing and there is not a direct [correlation](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/most-religious-countries-in-the-world/) with an increase in [crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#/media/File:Map_of_world_by_intentional_homicide_rate_\(2015_only\).svg).
1.1.2.4.2.9.2.1. Pro: For example, the US, one of the most [religious](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/12/23/americans-are-in-the-middle-of-the-pack-globally-when-it-comes-to-importance-of-religion/) countries among the most developed ones, has higher [homicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate) rates than other less religious countries.
1.1.2.4.2.9.3. Con: Research about [criminal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4009388/) behavior crimes or atrocities points to [multifactorial](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/BooksOnline/He16-95.pdf) causes: biology, early experiences and education, social-cultural factors, motivation and opportunity are elements to consider.
1.1.2.4.2.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.1.1.
1.1.2.4.2.10. Pro: As religions make humans' actions judged by the omniscient power of God, leaders and followers are less likely to commit atrocities.
1.1.2.4.2.10.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.5.1.5.1.2.
1.1.2.4.2.10.2. Con: There are a lot of examples where people of faith have committed punishable actions in the eye of their own religions. With men of faith committing several sexual abuses on children, others known for embezzling church funds, clearly not all religious people are afraid or limited by God's judgement.
1.1.2.4.2.10.2.1. Pro: Directly as well as indirectly, religion has been subverted for radicalization, making it the primary cause of terrorism.
1.1.2.4.2.10.2.1.1. Con: The impact of religion is often exaggerated in the media by over-representation of religiously motivated terrorism.
1.1.2.4.2.10.2.1.1.1. Pro: According to a study, [terror](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world-0/terror-attacks-media-coverage-muslim-islamist-white-racism-islamophobia-study-georgia-state-a7820726.html) attacks in the US carried out by Muslims receive five times more media coverage than those by non-Muslims.
1.1.2.4.2.10.2.1.2. Pro: Some people who commit crimes and terrorism have used religion to access the mass and the vulnerable population. Criminals find in religion the excuse for their crime and a tool to win the trust of people.
1.1.2.4.2.10.2.2. Pro: Religious societies [are shown](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-secular-life/201410/secular-societies-fare-better-religious-societies) to have higher rates of corruption, violence, child abuse, STDs, unemployment, poverty, and disease.
1.1.2.4.2.10.2.3. Pro: Some communities and groups have suffered abuse and/or death in the name of religion. E.g. murder of LGBTQ, abuse of disabled children, removal of freedoms for women, child marriages, etc.

1.1.2.4.2.10.3. Con: An atrocity to one religion is another religion's "god's work"
1.1.2.4.3. Pro: There is some evidence that [Druids](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Druid), religious practitioners in ancient Celtic societies, would also resolve disputes.
1.1.2.4.4. Con: A prison is a structure too and religion isn't so different: Electrified bars made of peer pressure, surrounded by an ocean of hell, with your soul manacled to the floor, and a lock made of belief.
1.1.2.5. Con: Laws against theft and murder and other crimes existed long before organized religion did. Examples include [Urukagina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urukagina) a king who enacted reforms to curb murder and theft among other crimes in the 24th century BC.
1.1.2.6. Pro: Religion has organized populations and promised the reward of eternal bliss for good behavior, thus keeping the majority of the population behaving well.
1.1.2.6.1. Con: Even if this is granted, the morality of misleading followers, intentionally or not can be in question. Perhaps it is acceptable in some extreme cases. But when an individual is acting that out of norm, they are likely to behave badly even in the face of reward. Even when they believe the reward is true.
1.1.2.6.2. Pro: Knowing that there is a religion helps you know how people who believe in it think, behave, or even interact with others. Those people respect the values delivered by their religion so it's like a guide book to the morals of each religion believers.
1.1.2.6.2.1. Con: We don't need to pigeonhole people like that. It leads to bigotry, bias and discrimination.
1.1.2.6.2.2. Con: Many people don't act how religion tells them to act.
1.1.2.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.2.
1.1.2.6.4. Pro: Creating self-narratives [increases goal attainment and academic performances](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ritual-and-the-brain/201802/create-narrative-better-yourself)
1.1.2.6.5. Con: It promises the reward for what the religion considers to be good behavior. What a religion believes is good or bad behavior does not always translate to the general population or to modern society.
1.1.2.6.6. Con: Religion has controlled populations and promised the reward of eternal bliss for obeying dogma and/or threatened eternal damnation for disobeying, thus keeping the majority of the population cowed.
1.1.3. Con: With time many lessons become harmful to society as they do not easily change with society.
1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.5.1.
1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.
1.1.6. Con: Religions don't create philosophical frameworks. Philosophical frameworks are used to interpret and understand religion and as the religion ages, the frameworks change.
1.1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.
1.1.8. Pro: There are few questions that only religion can answer and not any other philosophy. For example, questions regarding existence or death.
1.1.8.1. Con: Religion does not have answers to these questions either it just makes up speculative answers with no justification at all.
1.1.8.2. Pro: The answer that religion provides are based on beliefs and opinions but an answer nonetheless for the faithful.
1.1.8.2.1. Con: A so called answer which is no more than a speculative guess is useless and can serve to encourage people to not search for the true answer thus stifling curiosity and progress.
1.1.8.3. Pro: Religion provides for objective meaning and an answer to the question of why we exist, which is a deep psychological need. How we exist or what exists for which science suggests answers can never meet that psychological need.
1.1.8.4. Con: Philosophy answers to the question of why we exist no different than religion. It also explores death and the afterlife. There is no evidence that these fields are only available to organized belief systems.
1.1.9. Pro: Absent religion, ideologies fill the void and motivate humans to do terrible things.
1.1.9.1. Pro: The decline of religion in western culture has prompted the rise of less advanced 'big stories ' or ideologies such as fascism and communism, which on their turn have caused the death of millions of people in a minimum amount of time. It is very unlikely those ideologies would have come into existence in a religious culture.  [jordanbpeterson.com](https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/)
1.1.9.1.1. Con: Religion has allied itself with fascism on many occasions.
1.1.9.1.1.1. Pro: [Islam and fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamofascism) have mixed.
1.1.9.1.1.2. Pro: [Christianity and fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christofascism) have mixed.
1.1.9.1.1.2.1. Pro: The Catholic Church had ample hegemony in all aspects of public and private life during Franco's [fascist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Catholicism) regime.
1.1.9.1.1.3. Pro: The Vatican had signed a [treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichskonkordat) with Nazi Germany.
1.1.9.1.1.4. Pro: [Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini) signed a concordat with the catholic church and was praised by the pope. He tried to convince the populous that fascism was Catholic.
1.1.9.1.1.5. Pro: The Vatican signed a [concordat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordat_of_1953) with Spain during Franco's regime.
1.1.9.1.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.1.2.1.
1.1.9.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.
1.1.9.2. Pro: Religious faith has at times encouraged resistance against the normalisation of vicious secular ethics - for example through [Dietrich Bonhoeffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietrich_Bonhoeffer) and through [The White Rose movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rose#Religion), both in Nazi Germany.
1.1.9.2.1. Con: Though Hitler himself may have been an atheist, Nazism was not necessarily secular. Religious observance was permitted in Nazi Germany, the soldiers wore [belt buckles](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GOTT_MIT_UNS_Koppel.JPG) that said God on our side, and Nazi Germany had a [concordat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichskonkordat) with the Vatican. Moreover one of the most prominent sources of the preexisting European antisemitism was Christianity.
1.1.9.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.4.
1.1.9.2.1.2. Con: Antisemitism and nazism are not interchangable.
1.1.9.2.1.3. Con: The nazis primarely used and advocated racially motivated antisemitism. Pre-christian antisemitism existed in Europe and was usually motivated by cultural and ethnic differences.
1.1.9.2.1.3.1. Con: Jews barely existed in Europe before Christianity with small communities in Rome and Greece and the Empire tolerated them and allowed them to keep their faith.
1.1.9.2.1.3.1.1. Con: This does not preclude antisemitic sentiment from Greeks and Romans. Institutional toleration does not equate to popular acceptance.
1.1.9.2.1.3.2. Con: It was not until the rise of [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_antisemitism#Late_Roman_Empire) that the tolerance for Jews in the Roman empire disappeared and turned into persecution.
1.1.9.2.1.3.2.1. Con: Historical records show Roman statesmen being actively antagonistic towards Jews before the common era, suggesting that the protected status of Jews within the Roman empire was not always assured and did not always preclude hostility towards them.
1.1.9.2.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Hostility is to be expected when [rebellions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_wars) by the Jews were not all that rare this is not the same as antisemitism.
1.1.9.2.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Cicero expressed antisemitic claims openly over 50 years before the Roman annexation of Judea and subsequent Jewish revolts.
1.1.9.2.1.4. Con: Nazism was only one example of fascist ethics which in turn is one example of "vicious secular ethics". Other examples include imperialism and capitalism. All of these -isms have their own separate anthropologies through which they apply their own ethics systems. But all of them worship power and despise the weak and the poor or othered.
1.1.9.2.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.2.1.3.2.
1.1.9.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.1.
1.1.9.3. Pro: Kantian ethics was used by Eichmann as a [justification](http://peped.org/philosophicalinvestigations/extract-2-eichmanns-trial-invokes-kant/) of the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust). He said that he [represented](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/239401/summary) the moral will of the people and that overruled his personal feelings about the jews, being a yiddish speaking self proclaimed zionists himself. As explained in [Hannah Arendt](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/hannah-arendt-adolf-eichmann-banality-of-evil)'s 'Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil' \(1963\).
1.1.9.3.1. Con: Experts and [scholars](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/hannah-arendt-adolf-eichmann-banality-of-evil) have considered that Eichmann [distorted](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/239401/summary) Kant's philosophy to make it fit his needs.
1.1.9.3.1.1. Con: -> See discussion #15369: Eichmann did not distort Kant but applied the ideas correctly, the philosophy itself has a flaw in it that allowed for the persecution of a race.
1.1.9.3.2. Con: [Ad Hilterum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum). Not every secular government or ideology was responsible for mass murders, not every religious government or ideology was irresponsible for mass murders.
1.1.9.4. Con: Ideologies and dogmatism do motivate and cause humans to do terrible things. However, this does not imply that with the loss or absence of religion an ideology will come and necessarily fill the void. There is no evidence that lack of religion implies the adoption of harmful ideologies.
1.1.9.5. Con: The void of religion can be filled with humanism.
1.1.9.5.1. Pro: Religion segregates individuals and encourages people to 'blindly' or with 'faith' obey what higher powers \(man not god\) have decreed, without question.  Going back to common sense, good morals and values makes more sense then following archaic, out of date and dubious direction from people whose main differentiator from the majority, is that they are in positions of power.
1.1.9.6. Con: A belief that martyrdom and murder will be rewarded with paradise is not one that needs replacing. Such a belief can be dropped without adding anything in its place.
1.1.9.7. Pro: Absent religion, humans tend to place \(or be forced to place\) faith in people. [Cults of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality) have given us the greatest death tolls caused by regimes: Mao's regime was responsible for the [deaths of up to 45 million](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html); Stalin for up to [25 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_deaths_in_the_Soviet_Union_under_Joseph_Stalin); Adolf Hitler's Third Reich for at least [10 million](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1481975/The-Holocaust-death-toll.html). Untold millions have suffered under such cults and still do. \(Hitler is often cited as Christian; [his ultimate goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler#Views_on_religion) was excising faith and placing himself as a center of adoration and worship\).
1.1.9.7.1. Con: Absence of religion doesn't necessarily lead to cult of personality.
1.1.9.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.9.3.2.
1.1.9.8. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.8.5.
1.1.10. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.
1.1.11. Pro: Most religions have spread a message of love and respect to others.
1.1.11.1. Pro: Religions are good when they told people that they are loved by a creator, thus all the people are loved exactly equally. So it is automatic to love all the people, because all of us are made of the same things.
1.1.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.1.
1.1.11.1.2. Con: Not all beings are loved equally by the creator.
1.1.11.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.
1.1.11.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.2.
1.1.11.1.3. Con: It's called a carrot. Hell is the stick. It's part of a good confidence trick.
1.1.11.1.4. Con: If it was actually automatic to love everyone there would not be so much religious division and conflict. Many religions teach that even if god loves everyone he will condemn non believers to eternal punishment. People believing different religions often do not love each other because they take it as an insult that they disagree.
1.1.11.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.
1.1.11.2. Pro: Only religion can compel people to love their enemies and therefore propagate peace. Evolutionary ideas \(survival of the fittest\), if we are to hold to those ideas honestly, naturally compel us to destroy those who might cause us harm. [\(Mt. 5:44\)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A44&version=NIV)
1.1.11.2.1. Con: Religions often do not effectively compel people to love their enemies or compel them to both love and hate them at the same time resulting in conflict rather than peace.
1.1.11.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.
1.1.11.2.2. Con: Loving one's enemies is not necessarily a good thing. If one focuses on loving their enemies they may be hesitant to fight injustice caused by those enemies.
1.1.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.
1.1.11.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.
1.1.11.5. Con: Each religion is distinct and different with the defining feature being belief in the supernatural. The core being supernatural belief does not necessarily promote positive behavior or strengthen communities.
1.1.11.5.1. Con: All major religions have a [core morality](https://i2.wp.com/kidworldcitizen.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/52014Golden_Rule_Poster.jpg) that is summed up in treating others in the way that you want to be treated.
1.1.11.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.4.
1.1.11.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.
1.1.11.6. Con: Today we have enough knowledge to promote good behaviour and build communities with our minds rather than religion.
1.1.11.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.
1.1.11.7. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.
1.1.11.8. Pro: "The form of worship \[religion\] that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation, and to keep oneself without spot from the world" \([Jas 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A27&version=NIV)\). A religious group is much better equipped to take care of widows and orphans because they do so out of love.
1.1.11.8.1. Con: Atheists who volunteer would be doing so out of love and empathy, the difference between them and the religious is not love but rather that they are doing it despite not being commanded to.
1.1.11.8.2. Con: Atheists that help will do so with proselytizing at this captive vulnerable audience.
1.1.12. Con: The instrument of religion is faith, on the contrary,  the instrument of philosophy is knowledge.
1.1.12.1. Pro: There is no scientific proof supporting any statement done by any religion about the existence of any god nor any miraculous event.
1.1.13. Con: Religion has frequently claimed the moral high ground, but its position that people of faith are morally superior to those without faith is as bigoted as suggesting the contrary.
1.1.14. Con: The most beneficial moral codes were developed naturally in societies, and were not created by religions. Codes against crimes for example, must be developed for an community of people to remain stable, and not destroy itself. Religion's claim at moral authority is only a tool for societal control.
1.1.14.1. Pro: The pragmatic value that religious moral provide comes from the social aspect, which can be disentangled from the supernatural belief aspect.
1.1.14.1.1. Con: Religion can have deep pragmatic value on a personal and individual plane, such as empowerment and/or inner peace.
1.1.14.1.2. Pro: The same pragmatic value 'religious' belief has in society can be achieved by other means.
1.1.14.1.3. Pro: Not all religious beliefs have pragmatic value.  Whether you believe in the holy trinity of God or not is neutral as far as pragmatism goes.
1.1.15. Pro: Religion created a central set of ethics for a community, not only individuals, to act, think and improve upon. It isn't just for an individual improvement but more importantly about social advancement.
1.1.15.1. Con: Religion usurped governments' authority and requirement to create and uphold laws for everyone. By creating laws that served the religion they failed everyone else. This was not social advancement, this was social entrenchment, setting back liberalization indefinitely.
1.1.15.1.1. Pro: There is a lack of [African American cardinals](https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/where-are-african-american-cardinals).
1.1.15.1.2. Pro: Every few years the Pope seems to put a different softer spin on homosexuality, but it's all a front—the Vatican's policy never actually changes.
1.1.15.1.3. Con: Government creating laws to serve anything other than the people's welfare is legislative failure by government officials. Of course a lot of people use religion as a tool in politics and others try to impose religion but fail to serve the people's welfare i.e. they don't understand the way of life of the religion or how to run a country.
1.1.15.1.4. Pro: There are no female cardinals, because there are not allowed to be any.
1.1.15.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.2.
1.1.15.1.4.2. Pro: Many [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarianism#Roles_in_the_Church) denominations restrict governing and teaching roles in the Church to only men.
1.1.15.1.4.2.1. Pro: In [1 Timothy 2:12-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+2%3A12-14&version=ESV), the Apostle Paul justifies his claim that women ought not teach or exercise authority over men by showing that man was created first. Paul's basis for making a distinction in roles is God's created design.
1.1.15.1.4.2.2. Pro: Especially decision-making [posts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_popes).
1.1.15.1.4.2.3. Pro: The bible says "Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law." [\[1Cor 14:34-38\]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+14%3A34-38&version=KJV) Women cannot be priests if they are not allowed to even speak in the church.
1.1.15.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.
1.1.15.3. Pro: Religion has motivated people to be accountable for their own actions without direct government punishment, or social pressure.
1.1.15.3.1. Con: Religion itself inflicts social pressure as well as issuing punishments such as excommunication or shunning and in the past even death.
1.1.15.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.5.
1.1.15.5. Con: Religion has merely taken existing [human ethics](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/05/why-its-obvious-that-morality-precedes-religion/) and claimed them as a product of their own.
1.1.16. Con: There are other, superior, sources of philosophical frameworks and moral codes.
1.1.16.1. Con: Science can be enabled to do terrible things in order to propagate the "survival of the fittest" \(eugenics, killing of infants, euthanasia etc.\), the answer to stop it is balanced religion.
1.1.16.1.1. Con: Euthanasia is a choice for patients, often supported by several health experts.
1.1.16.1.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #985: Every human should have the right and means to decide when and how to die.
1.1.16.1.2. Con: The answer to stop it is morality. Religion is unnecessary.
1.1.16.2. Pro: Using a [utilitarian approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) encourages people to think about the costs and benefits of their actions in a way that a rules-based framework provided by a religion does not.
1.1.16.3. Con: At the core of any moral philosophy is the faith that whichever you conform to is grounded in a metaphysical understanding of human nature. If that core of human nature, that holy spirit, was not there we would be unable to speak on the good.
1.1.16.3.1. Con: [Secular ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_ethics) is a topic in philosophy and is not based on faith. There are many different versions none of which are based on faith.
1.1.16.3.1.1. Pro: [Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is not based on faith.
1.1.16.3.1.2. Pro: [Kantian Deontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantian_ethics) is not based on faith.
1.1.16.3.1.3. Pro: [Ethical intuitionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_intuitionism) is not based on faith.
1.1.16.3.1.4. Pro: All forms of [moral relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism) are not based in faith.
1.1.16.3.1.4.1. Con: If someone has no faith in their moral convictions, how can they say they are true? Moral relativism is grounded in the idea that we cannot know what is good and therefore does not speak on the good or of it.
1.1.16.3.1.4.1.1. Con: The point of Relativism is to judge actions as good or bad based on the context of the society in which one lives. It is an inherently subjective framework but nonetheless enables moral judgements to take place.
1.1.16.4. Pro: [Ethical naturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_naturalism) is the attempt to get morals out of the real world instead of out of holy texts.
1.1.16.5. Pro: [Moral intuitionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_intuitionism) is a moral framework by which we gain our ethical information from our natural intuitions.
1.1.16.6. Pro: Moral relativism can help people navigate the world by denying absolute moral rules and thus freeing people to do what they think is right in any given situation. In cultural relativism people decide together what is considered acceptable and moral behavior allowing society to freely change with the times.
1.1.16.6.1. Con: Cultural relativism has its own flaws, the main one of which is that it lags as much as the culture, i.e. The rules are your ancestors', which are possibly out of date even to the point of being harmful.
1.1.16.7. Pro: [Kantian ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantian_ethics) is a godless version of deontology, which proposes categorical imperatives. The requirement for these imperatives is that they should lead to good outcomes if followed by all people, in all circumstances. It also stresses the need to treat conscious beings as ends in their own right, and not means to lead to something greater.
1.1.16.7.1. Con: Kantian morality has been [criticized](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/sanjacinto-philosophy/chapter/kantian-ethics-criticisms/) as self-contradictory, and have presented a number of cases in which the Formula of Universal Law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer.
1.1.16.7.2. Con: Kantian ethics is useless in a practical sense since it requires people to behave as if everyone follows the same rules since every action must weighed as if it was based on a universal rule. In practice people do not all behave this way and making choices based on a hypothetical world that does not actually exist will lead to many things traditionally viewed as awful.
1.1.16.7.2.1. Con: Kant believed that the maxims of the categorical imperative work because [human reason is innate](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-judgment/). The rules should work universally.
1.1.16.7.2.1.1. Con: [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4050437/) [have](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17128609) shown that our reasoning abilities are often impaired or affected by our emotions. Since our reason is subjected to emotional influence the perfect reasoning necessary for Kant's imperative to work universally is impossible.
1.1.16.7.3. Con: -> See 1.1.9.3.
1.1.16.8. Con: Philosophical frameworks have also justified horrendous actions.
1.1.16.8.1. Con: Humans have justified their atrocious acts by distorting philosophy, from [Kant](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/hannah-arendt-adolf-eichmann-banality-of-evil) to [Nietzsche](http://bigthink.com/scotty-hendricks/how-the-nazis-hijacked-nietzsche-and-how-it-can-happen-to-anybody), therefore the value of moral codes cannot then be found in extreme versions of them.
1.1.16.8.1.1. Con: As it deals in extremes, philosophy is still fundamentally responsible for the extreme actions of those following that philosophy.
1.1.16.8.1.1.1. Pro: Philosophers tend to deal in absolutes, which can encourage totalitarianism.
1.1.16.8.1.1.1.1. Con: Philosophers deal with logical ideas taken to total conclusions, but artists interpret those ideas, and that is  fundamental to the process of persuasion. While philosophers do not persuade the masses, an appeal to the ecstatic  can do this. This is what artist do.
1.1.16.8.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Nazis needed Wagner and torchlight marches, great theater in itself to persuade the people of their misinterpreted Nietzsche.
1.1.16.8.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Pol Pot](https://fromthestudy.com/2017/03/06/intended-for-evil-a-survivors-story-of-love-faith-and-courage-in-the-cambodian-killing-fields-by-les-sillars/) “elevated farmers and agriculture–everything rural”. He believed that [Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot) was right to define humans as “noble savages” who were in their most natural state when they were separated from the corrupting influence of urban society.
1.1.16.8.2. Con: Religion dictates harm to others, but the philosophy of men has to be distorted in order for it to cause harm.
1.1.16.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.2.
1.1.16.10. Pro: There is no value that religion teaches that cannot be found in philosophy, politics, psychology...Therefore, all the good that mankind did through religion, could have been done anyway.
1.1.16.10.1. Pro: Except for the bad values that can be found in religion.
1.1.16.11. Pro: Atheism teaches people to come up with their own morals, which allows people to come up with better morals than most religions teach. People would learn to think for themselves as well as understand the reasoning behind behaviours, rather than just "Because you will be punished." It would also be easier for these morals to be popular if people didn't already believe in religious morals, such as the cruel ones.
1.1.17. Con: Spirituality and Morality are both possible without having any sort of dogmatic obedience behind it. Religion is not needed for spiritual promotion, and furthermore, can work to oppress that spiritual promotion, confining it to operate in ways that are only approved by the religious prose.
1.1.17.1. Con: Religion is an organization to systematized the beliefs and core values of spirituality of humanity. While making a system does not always result for good, it is necessary have a collective and clear statement of what it holds true so that present and future generations can make an evaluation on its impact to to society.
1.1.18. Con: Religions can promote dogmatic thinking which hinders our freedom to question ideas and ethical and moral values that might need periodical assessment and re-evaluation
1.1.19. Pro: Religion is more than just a code of morals or social community, it hinges on the potential existence of a higher, godly power and our relationship to that power. If found to be true, that would make religion not just good for humankind but essential.
1.1.20. Con: Any argued advantages of religion in the form of moral parables or other appeals to [empathy](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470910600985605), in reality, [precede](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163604) religion, as they are merely a component of mirror neurons. Humanity in no way needs religion to achieve morality or selflessness.
1.1.21. Pro: Religion gives morals for people who behave irrationally, using heaven and hell as an incentive for the cruel to act kind.
1.1.21.1. Con: Religions set a bad precedent that applies outside religion, that it's okay to believe: That we don't need evidence and logic to draw conclusions.
1.1.21.1.1. Pro: The knock on effect in someone's life of deciding that they can draw conclusions without solid evidence can undermine their life bringing chaos through ignorance rather than order through investigation.
1.1.21.1.2. Con: In different religions there are great philosophers who have searched for logic and evidence to draw conclusions and evaluate the religion, supporting precisely reason.
1.1.21.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.5.4.
1.1.21.1.2.2. Con: It's plausible that each of these great philosophers did not truly believe, instead choosing to conform only to avoid trouble, and remained unhindered by drawing unfounded assumptions.
1.1.21.1.2.3. Con: Logic based on unsupported assumption is flawed. Logic not based on unsupported assumption has no bearing on nor value from the practitioner being religious.
1.1.21.1.2.4. Con: [Rationalism long predates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism#History) Christianity. Philosophical and scientific inquiry began long before Christianity.
1.1.21.1.2.4.1. Pro: Considering the big [influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy#Medieval) from Hellenistic and Roman Philosophy \(Socrates, Plato and Aristotle\) in Medieval Christian thinkers, it is arguably that non-religious philosophers from [Ancient](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Western-philosophy#ref16251) times were actually more seminal to Western philosophy than those applying Christian doctrines to previously constructed theories.
1.1.21.1.2.5. Pro: Nearly all the founders of modern science were Christians. These include men such as [Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler), [Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle), [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal), [Pasteur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur), [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton), etc.
1.1.21.1.2.5.1. Con: Christianity only tolerated their scientific work on the premise that it did not conflict Christianity. The moment they discovered or hypothesized anything contrary to Christian doctrine, religious authorities would do pretty much anything to step in the way of their ability to do science.
1.1.21.1.2.5.2. Con: Also, nearly all of them, included the ones listed, were white and male. Following this logic would imply that being white, male and religious makes you a good scientist.
1.1.21.1.2.5.3. Con: Without illustrating that Christianity specifically motivated and provoked their pursuit of science and rationality simply listing founding scientists who happen to be Christians is not evidence for anything.
1.1.21.1.2.6. Con: This leaves out the not-so-great philosophers who reject logic and evidence to draw conclusion, in favor of their religion.
1.1.21.1.2.6.1. Pro: For example, [Al-Ghazali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali#Reception_of_his_work), who basically made the case that [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali#Incoherence_of_the_Philosophers) didn't work because it didn't show faith to be reasonable and failed to prove the existence of God.
1.1.21.1.2.6.1.1. Pro: [Ibn Rushd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes), a rationalist, "[attempted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali#Reception_of_his_work) to refute al-Ghazali's views, though the work was not well received in the Muslim community".
1.1.21.1.2.6.1.2. Pro: [Orientalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali#Reception_of_his_work) scholars argued that Al-Ghazali caused a "decline in scientific advancement in Islam, due to his refutation of the new philosophies of his time".
1.1.21.1.3. Con: Believing without evidence is not always bad and faith can lead to beneficial outcomes.
1.1.21.1.3.1. Pro: Faith was an [important factor](https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/kf/rel_Bernard_Lafayette.pdf) in keeping the American Civil Rights movement together in the face of a concerted and powerful opposition.
1.1.21.1.3.1.1. Con: It's impossible to know that people would not have stepped up to lead had churches not done so.
1.1.21.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: We do know that there were a number of crucial atheist leaders in the movement, such as [A. Philip Randolph](https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/03/03/great-atheists-civil-rights-movement/Dt3WqwHgZZYBapznnupmXL/story.html).
1.1.21.1.3.1.2. Con: Many of the [Churches themselves](https://archives.nbclearn.com/portal/site/k-12/flatview?cuecard=5041) did not participate, even as their congregations did.
1.1.21.1.3.1.3. Con: The religious narrative instilled in the movement diminished the role of other oppressed groups that the religious did not like and cemented religious influence in the black community.
1.1.21.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: [Homophobia](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41675211?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) may be more prevalent in the African American community because of religious influences.
1.1.21.1.3.1.3.2. Pro: Certain components of religious practice, such as the attitude to money and education, can contribute to individuals remaining in or rising out of poverty. It is [argued](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-a-keister/religion-contributes-wealth-poverty_b_1069766.html) that Conservative Protestantism may help perpetuate poverty.
1.1.21.1.3.1.3.2.1. Con: The failure to provide [reparations](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/) for the stolen wealth of slavery is a far more convincing explanation as to why this community may struggle with poverty.
1.1.21.1.3.2. Pro: Faith was a component in the Parliamentarian's struggle, and eventual victory, in the [English Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War).
1.1.21.1.3.2.1. Con: The monarchy of England was eventually restored and the leader of the rebellion [Oliver Cromwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell#Political_reputation) effectively made himself a dictator. This is not the kind of example to be used as a plus mark for religion. This is especially the case given that the monarchs were head of the [church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England).
1.1.21.1.3.3. Con: A stopped clock is right twice a day.
1.1.21.1.3.4. Con: This might be true when there is not enough evidence available. However, the habit of believing without relying on evidence, which may be more common among the religious, makes it socially acceptable for people to ignore available evidence in favor of religious dogma.
1.1.21.1.3.5. Con: Getting hit by a car may have beneficial outcomes if the victim gets a massive settlement or if they somehow meet their future spouse as a result. This doesn't justify trying to get hit by a car or thinking it is not bad.
1.1.21.1.3.6. Con: Statistical coincidence ensures that sometimes believing without evidence is not bad, but it still usually is.
1.1.21.1.4. Con: Most of human experience is subjective, and religion is an appropriate way to process our experience where logic and empiricism cannot.
1.1.21.1.4.1. Con: Processing in this manner amounts to choosing to perceive "evil" instead of human nature, and choosing perceive misfortune as a "test from god". The failure isn't in logic or empiricism, it's in the beholder.
1.1.21.1.4.1.1. Pro: [Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus) called it a philosophical suicide.
1.1.21.1.4.2. Con: Religion is not only applied to experiences that logic and empiricism cannot process, as shown by constant clashes between religion and science. In every single case, religion holds back logic and empiricism.
1.1.21.1.4.2.1. Pro: Religions have destroyed knowledge in the name of their god countless times through history. Thus religions delayed advancement of humanity.
1.1.21.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Religiously motivated [burning of books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_burning) was commonplace and continues to this day.
1.1.21.1.4.2.2. Pro: Religion has punished those with new \(and correct\) ideas setting back progress.  For [example](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Galileo_affair), Galileo was imprisoned for writing in support of heliocentrism.
1.1.21.1.4.2.2.1. Con: The few examples of church opposition to scientific progress pale in comparison to its contribution to knowledge. For example, [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei#Controversy_over_heliocentrism) was not killed or even imprisoned, just put under temporary house arrest and allowed to continue his work.
1.1.21.1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: Being under house arrest does not seem a great endorsement of scientific discovery.
1.1.21.1.4.2.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13.
1.1.21.1.4.2.2.1.3. Pro: Galileo was able [to continue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair#Trial_and_second_judgment,_1633) to work and publish under house arrest.
1.1.21.1.4.2.2.1.4. Con: Not killing someone does not count as a contribution towards science. It is rather not completely getting in the way of science but is still not a contribution.
1.1.21.1.4.2.3. Pro: The Catholic Church has [disputed the theory evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_and_the_Catholic_Church).
1.1.21.1.4.2.4. Pro: Due to religious push back [stem cell research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_laws_and_policy_in_the_United_States) was restricted and in part banned.
1.1.21.1.5. Pro: Religion creates a fantasy supposedly coexisting with reality. Then people prioritize this fantasy over reality in making decisions.
1.1.21.1.6. Pro: This has or will lead to hindering the logical thought process of seeking to understand and derive logical answers for any sort of claims
1.1.21.1.7. Pro: Religions provide an understanding of reality that is by nature further from the truth than that uncovered by scientific method. Human actions based on perceptions further from the truth yields worse results in areas such as medicine, engineering and restricts important perspectives on ourselves and our place in the universe \(e.g. timescale, evolution, our importance\).
1.1.21.1.8. Pro: Science has a method for weeding out the false, while religion does not.
1.1.21.1.9. Pro: Religion is a way to understand the Unknown, namely death and what happens to us after it. But, it requires no test, inquiry or research.
1.1.21.1.9.1. Pro: This allows for intellectual apathy in addressing problems, while attaching a person interest \(life after death/paradise\) to maintaining the faith.
1.1.21.1.10. Pro: Religion is permissive towards irrational/superstitious thinking and behaviors that then permeates other domains like politics
1.1.21.2. Con: The "rampant [forgiveness](https://nexusnovel.wordpress.com/2007/01/03/forgiveness-in-different-religions/) of sins" encourages sin.
1.1.21.3. Pro: Heaven and hell can be viewed as conceptions of your potential future. By designing your own heaven \(desired future\) to [strive for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system) and your own hell \(unwanted future\) [to avoid](http://integratedleader.com/articles/Importance_Fear.pdf), you are essentially [maximizing your motivation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9pTz2_utU4) by using two different motivational systems.
1.1.21.3.1. Con: Heaven and Hell is a bipolar system based on fear, which suggest to do good things to avoid hell and not do bad things to go to heaven. It's an amoral system.
1.1.21.3.2. Con: However, "your own heaven" and "your own hell" are not what religion promote. Religions generally preempt the creation of, or usurp people's versions of, heaven or hell. Thus, led by religion, people may end up in the religion's idea of heaven, which to them may be far from optimal. For instance religion and pregnancy may lead someone to marry and settle down where they're more suited to an outrageously dangerous lifestyle with nobody left to grieve if they die.
1.1.21.3.2.1. Con: This is an Abraham-centric generalization of "religion."  Taoism, Confucianism, Hinduism, and Buddhism provide frameworks for a person to understand their relationship with their self, the people around them, and the world around them, and the purpose of these relationships. An argument about the utility of religion cannot simply cast aside half of the world's religious history as if it is irrelevant.
1.1.21.4. Pro: Religions have successfully provided imagery of tales and protagonists, and associated that to models for sensitivity, understanding, thought, action, and interaction, which can be applied both on individual and social levels, and to people of different upbringings.
1.1.21.4.1. Con: The same has been done by literature, without giving massive power to the writers.
1.1.21.4.2. Con: Many of the "protagonists" in religious tales are negative role models if emulated. For example, in the judeo-christian story of Abraham, he is willing to kill his son for religious purposes. Later he kills an animal for religious purposes. This character is widely believed to be "good" by followers of judeo-christian religions.
1.1.21.5. Con: Religion tells people to be kind and compassionate to others lest they fall from grace. Humans should be kind to each other because it's the right thing to do, not for fear of a gods wrath and judgment.
1.1.22. Con: Religious texts are infinitely fallible because they are man-made products of whimsy, poetry, mythology and some history woven together into a new whole.
1.1.22.1. Con: If religion is man-made, then all man-made philosophies would be equally as fallible.
1.1.22.1.1. Con: The difference between religion and other philosophies are that religion is typically un-falsifiable while things like science and math can be used and tested and be shown to be legitimate and shown to work.
1.1.23. Con: Religion did not invent "moral codes" it implemented them.
1.1.23.1. Pro: Basic morality is an evolutionary adaptation, that may be traced back to the need of our ancestors to survive in small groups in Savannah and ultimately to [the selfish gene theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene-centered_view_of_evolution#Selfish-gene_theory).
1.1.23.1.1. Pro: Some aspects of morallity are observed even in non-human animals, e.g. [bonobo and chimpanzees](http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/elist/eListRead/chimps_and_bonobos_prove_that_moral_behavior_is_a_product_of_evolution/).
1.1.23.2. Pro: The predisposition toward caring has been [observed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_learning_in_animals) in a wide variety of animals. Neurophilosophy and [neurosciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience) in general tend to show that morality as we know it, might be a survival tool given by evolution processes. The better a species get as using this tool, the better it will perform in an evolutionary context.
1.1.24. Con: Religious moral claim usually looks like a blackmail tactic. People should follow tenets or be condemned and punished in the afterlife.
1.1.24.1. Con: Religions provide a different incentive. People may choose not to punch others because they might get thrown in prison. That is another form of blackmail. If all people's actions were perfect, there would never need to be incentives to behave, but we seem to need them.
1.1.24.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.
1.2. Pro: Religions emerged as an evolutionary adaptation. They spread the adoption of behaviors that provided evolutionary advantages.
1.2.1. Con: Religion has also spread behaviors that provide evolutionary disadvantages.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Martyrdom has long been celebrated by religions and can in some cases encourage disastrous behaviors such as suicide bombing.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Many religions over time have engaged in human sacrifice.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Human sacrifice could have had [evolutionary benefits](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/human-sacrifice-may-have-helped-societies-become-more-complex). Thus the prevalence of human sacrifice does not necessarily counteract the evolutionary benefit of religion.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Religion may have spread traits such as gullibility, cowardice or conformity.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Education tends to reduce human proclivity to [gullibility](https://theconversation.com/why-are-some-people-more-gullible-than-others-72412) and, at the same time, those more educated tend to be less religious.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: According to research, religious people tend to have specific traits that remain constant cross-culturally and cross-religiously: religiosity is associated with to high [agreeableness](https://cdn.uclouvain.be/public/Exports%20reddot/psyreli/documents/2003.EOLSS.pdf) and conscientiousness.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: In terms of [values](https://cdn.uclouvain.be/public/Exports%20reddot/psyreli/documents/2003.EOLSS.pdf), religious individuals \(regardless of particular faith or culture\) tend to give higher importance to "tradition, conformity, and benevolence", and low  importance to "hedonism, stimulation, and   self-direction".
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: Religion often relies on simple and intuitive cognitive processes, rather than complex ones.
1.2.1.3.3.1. Pro: [Cognitive fluency](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/07/how-cognitive-fluency-affects-decision-making.php),  a “subjective experience of the ease or difficulty of completing a mental task”, also makes people believe things or like them because those things feel familiar, are well-expressed and in tune with their own expectations. This could explain why self-assuring religious [myths](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160323-why-are-people-so-incredibly-gullible) are easier to believe regardless of factual information.
1.2.1.3.3.2. Pro: Human cognitive process tend to rely on intuition rather than [analysis](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160323-why-are-people-so-incredibly-gullible) to save energy. Therefore, if ideas come from familiar sources, other people believe them and align with our own beliefs and are good in terms of storytelling, we may tend believe them, even if proper scrutiny would render them false.
1.2.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Humans have evolved to deal with [information](https://theconversation.com/why-are-some-people-more-gullible-than-others-72412) in two different ways: in a fast, automatic and intuitive process and in a slow, analytical and rational way. As we tend to have a positivity bias \(we assume people act honestly\) and a confirmation bias \(we tend to believe what fits our views\), the first way is often used and while good in ancestral small groups, it can also be dangerous, especially in bigger and more developed societies.
1.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.
1.2.1.5. Con: Religions that majorly spread evolutionary disadvantageous behaviors either went extinct, have been assimilated or are regarded as primitive.
1.2.1.5.1. Con: Declaring religious practices primitive now does not lessen their negative impact on history.
1.2.1.5.2. Pro: When [Mayas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice_in_Maya_culture) encountered an environmental constraint \(drought\), their preferred solution was to reduce their population by sacrificing their peers to the rain god.
1.2.1.6. Pro: Being content with suffering and death in the hopes of an afterlife may cause some to resign to defeat.
1.2.1.7. Pro: Religions state that it is God who provides shelter, food, water, etc. This disconnects us from nature, which is "who" actually provide our resources.
1.2.1.8. Con: Just because an adaptation has negative byproducts does not make the adaptation as a whole maladaptive.
1.2.1.9. Con: The fact that we're still here kinda contradicts this argument. We're the survivors of humans with religion. Religion has been an evolutionary disadvantage mainly for those that were killed by people with religion, but not for us, the survivors.
1.2.1.10. Con: Disadvantages seen today may have been useful at some point in evolution, but are now considered [evolution remnants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_vestigiality).
1.2.1.11. Pro: Extreme pacifism promoted by faiths like [Janism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism#Non-violence_\(ahimsa\)), or [Anabaptist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabaptism), among others, can make believers not able to defend themselves or others.
1.2.1.11.1. Con: Unwillingness to defend ones self is a personal choice that ought to be respected. Such a choice has no bearing on a persons ability to defend ones self.
1.2.1.11.1.1. Con: If someone is born and indoctrinated into a culture or religion which promotes absolute pacifism it is more a product of that than of their own personal informed choice.
1.2.1.11.2. Con: Jehovah's Witnesses have never worried about defending themselves with arms. Their more effective [defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_cases_involving_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_by_country) has been in the courts.
1.2.1.11.3. Con: Others may protect them but they won't defend others. This seems to create inequity.
1.2.1.11.3.1. Con: Protection should be provided to them by dedicated law enforcement officers. They are not obliged to take that role.
1.2.1.11.4. Con: Violence only begets more violence. Hence, the act of not resorting to violence is good for humanity, not bad. Violence is not the only route to protecting one's self.
1.2.1.11.4.1. Con: Many progressive movements have only gained influence through the use of violence. Even passive resistance demands violence against self in order to succeed.
1.2.1.11.4.2. Con: Sometimes a word or action is so abhorrent that a non-violent response would not be enough. Ignoring , turning the other cheek or responding with more words could be an act of tolerance, and we should not tolerate the intolerant.
1.2.1.11.4.3. Pro: All violence can be seen to be the result of words failing. So long as there is a chance for humans to discuss things and continue a dialogue, will not feel the need to resort to violence. If violence has occurred, it follows that we have either not used language correctly \(or at all\) or that our argument has failed. Sometimes our argument is successful and the other cannot find an argument to resist, and at this point they may respond with violence. Violence stems from a lack of words.
1.2.1.11.4.3.1. Con: Some violence has nothing to do with communication or lack thereof.
1.2.1.11.4.3.1.1. Pro: For instance rape. It's frequently about power.
1.2.1.11.4.3.1.2. Pro: Abuse against spouses or children which is caused by anger issues and often aggravated by addiction is violence that asserts power and dominance but is not caused by lack of communication.
1.2.1.11.4.3.1.3. Pro: Violence related to [sadistic personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadistic_personality_disorder) is caused by a condition in which someone derives pleasure on inflicting pain on others \(or oneself\).
1.2.1.11.4.4. Con: In some cases violence is the only reasonable response to violence. In the cases of mass genocide to not fight back would be to condemn millions to death.
1.2.1.11.4.4.1. Con: Martyrs who respond violence with non-violence often venerated. They are not seen as bad or evil. They were good and lived peacefully in accordance to universal moral authority even to the point of death.
1.2.1.11.4.4.1.1. Con: It is likely that many victims of genocide would rather have survived than be venerated.
1.2.1.11.4.5. Con: Being able to defend yourself does not imply voluntarily creating violence. Self-defence and malevolence are two distinct ideas.
1.2.1.11.4.6. Pro: Violence is not the only route. Seeking help from a stronger ally through use of diplomacy to intimidate your foe through the threat of possible violence is a way as well.
1.2.1.11.4.6.1. Con: Diplomacy was tried and failed in the case of Nazi Germany. Not only were the Nazis murdering German citizens but they were invading other countries, war was the only way to stop them.
1.2.1.11.4.6.2. Con: To be in a position to offer realistic threats of violence, you must have experience with self-defence so that it may be credible to your opponent.
1.2.1.11.4.7. Pro: Diplomacy and trade are options to deter violence so that you could protect yourself.
1.2.1.11.4.7.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.11.4.6.1.
1.2.2. Con: Even a good evolutionary adaption can lead to evil and vice versa. Being natural doesn't mean it's good \(naturalistic fallacy\).
1.2.3. Con: Religion may have been a self-selecting cultural trait, which means that it has persisted without necessarily granting an evolutionary advantage.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Natural selection may in fact act on religious ideas, for example tales that are easier to remember may outcompete tales that are more challenging. This leads to some ideas spreading with no requirement for those ideas to provide their "host" individuals with an advantage \(this is part of the [meme hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology_of_religion#Memes)\).
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: That a story is easier to remember may give it evolutionary value. The ability to quickly recall the 'moral' of a story can have application in practical ethics.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: The practical application depends on whether the morals of the story are actually beneficial themselves. Over time society is becoming more secular and discarding many of the morals of religion meaning society deems those morals as not beneficial.
1.2.3.2. Con: There is less evidence for a self-selecting mechanism than for one of genuine adaptation. For example, [surveys](https://www.edge.org/conversation/jonathan_haidt-moral-psychology-and-the-misunderstanding-of-religion) have shown that "religious [believers](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2886974/Study-Religious-people-happier-life-satisfaction-others.html) in the United States are [happier](https://theconversation.com/are-religious-people-happier-than-non-religious-people-87394), healthier, [longer-lived](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/16/health/religion-lifespan-health/index.html), and more generous to charity and to each other than are secular people."
1.2.3.2.1. Con: Suveys don't provide reliable information about evolutionary advantage.
1.2.4. Con: It seems unlikely that evolution created religion. Thousands of people didn't wake up one morning with the same set of unfounded assumptions and decide to write them down and start praying to them.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Most religions have an account for the creation of the religion, an account that occurs before it became widespread.
1.2.5. Pro: Religion provides a solution in the face of nihilism and the dramatic nature of existence. This is called the [Terror management theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_management_theory).
1.2.5.1. Con: There are other ways to find meaning in life besides religion, such as through living for others by helping them, or attaching value to material goods such as money or wealth. Religion is not the only way to beat back nihlism
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Altruism is most commonly found in religious traditions, while too much wealth causes anxiety and is therefore not a good option for beating back nihilism. Religion is foundationally about finding meaning and is therefore the oldest and arguably best way to find meaning in ones life.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.6.
1.2.5.2. Con: Religion does not solve the problem of nihlism, because it never justifies why life has value; it claims that it does because of God. Thus, it would not satisfy a nihlist who was looking for some reason why life had value, since the religious justification depends on an unproven notion of God and his or her actions.
1.2.6. Con: Religion could also be a by-product of the evolutionary development of consciousness. For example, it could represent a [search of meaning where there is none](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_detection).
1.2.6.1. Con: Thinking that there is a meaning in something helps us to restore feelings of certainty and clarity which in turn could improve our [self-esteem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem). Thus, it could be considered as a useful evolutionary adaptation.
1.2.6.2. Con: Religion was likely an unexpected [spin-off](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23631561-000-effortless-thinking-the-godshaped-hole-in-your-brain/) of a useful adaptation - empahty. The need to understand the motives of the group members, crucial for survival, was re-employed to explain non-human objects' behavior. This good adaptation leads first to animism and ultimately to religion.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: Despite the religion being a possible spin-off of a positive adaptation - empathy - it does not justify the religion as something necessarily positive. Just as the ability to store fat was positive for hunter-gathers, but became a major cause of death due to obesity in the modern society, religion becomes one of the major causes for unnecessary violence and anti-scientific thinking.
1.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.
1.2.6.3. Con: If religion was just a by-product of human's characteristics, it would not have become the dominant organizing system of every society on earth. This demonstrates that it was a [useful adaptation](http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10063.pdf), and not a maladaption \(at least at the time\).
1.2.6.3.1. Pro: Despite predictions of religions' demise in the last centuries, most humans in the world are still religious and religions have been growing and mutating at a quick pace \([Norenzayan, p. 2\)](http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10063.pdf).
1.2.6.3.1.1. Pro: Estimates calculate that there are about 10,000 religions in the world, with most people adhering to a low number of big religions. Worldly, there are 2 billions of self-identified Christians and 1.3 people identify as Muslims \([Norenzayan, p.2](http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10063.pdf)\).
1.2.6.3.1.2. Con: In Australia, religiously [unaffiliated](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs\@.nsf/Lookup/by+Subject/2071.0~2016~Main+Features~Religion+Data+Summary~70) people have increased from less than 1% in 1966, to over 30% in 2016.
1.2.6.3.1.2.1. Con: This only applies to Australia, not the world.
1.2.6.3.1.3. Con: In Europe, the number of non-religious citizens, especially among young adults, is [increasing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/21/christianity-non-christian-europe-young-people-survey-religion).
1.2.6.3.1.4. Con: There is only one religion whose percentage share of the [population is expected to grow](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/) and that is Islam. This is only because [Muslims have the highest fertility rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_population_growth) of any religious group and is far above the average rate of the world population.
1.2.6.3.2. Con: While some religion may have thrived and survived as they provided advantages \(social cohesion, cooperation, rules\), some present-day societies are successful at “sustaining large-scale cooperation with institutions such as court, police and mechanisms for enforcing contracts” \([Norenzayan, p.9](http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10063.pdf)\).
1.2.6.3.2.1. Pro: In Scandinavian countries, strong institutions that facilitate cooperation “usurped” the community-building functions of religion, creating societies that are “some of the most cooperative, peaceful, and prosperous in the world” and thus making religion useless [\(Norenzayan, p.9\)](http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10063.pdf).
1.2.6.3.2.2. Con: The fact that other systems can, through reason or otherwise, replace religion, doesn't mean that religion hasn't been, up until then, the dominant and successful adaptation.
1.2.6.3.2.3. Con: The long-term effects of such replacements are not clear and there are examples of dismantling religion in communist countries which, at least partially, led to undesireable long-term consequences.
1.2.6.3.2.3.1. Con: The quoted [study](http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10063.pdf) does not talk about countries or systems that tried to dismantle or antagonize religion, but democratic countries with freedom of religion that provide a system, alongside religion, that offers much of the same benefits.
1.2.6.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: In that scenario of secular and religious competition, most developed countries tend to become less religious.
1.2.6.3.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.
1.2.6.3.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.2.1.1.
1.2.6.3.2.3.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.3.
1.2.6.3.3. Pro: Researchers consider that prosocial religions proliferated through “cultural diffusion, population expansions, and conquest” as they managed to forge “anonymous strangers into large, cohesive moral communities tied together with the sacred bonds of a common supernatural jurisdiction” \([Norenzayan, p. 9](http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10063.pdf)\).
1.2.6.4. Pro: Religion has been helpful in leading us to science as a means to understand the world around us. At any given point in time religion has filled in the gaps of knowledge we have, leading us to innovation that brightens those dark spots. As we build the means to see and understand those gaps, science takes over, but religious belief allowed us to survive and evolve enough to replace superstition with demonstrable truth.
1.2.6.4.1. Con: Religions historically have claimed to already know the answers to questions science asks. Filling in the gaps with unsupported claims does not encourage inquiry because it thinks it already has the answers.
1.2.6.4.1.1. Pro: Many people who dared to defy given answers were [burnt as heretics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_burned_as_heretics).
1.2.6.4.1.2. Pro: The big religions are based on revelation, not exploration. If one believes that the most important information in the world already has been written, it tends to cause less curiosity about science and the world as we see it today.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1. Pro: Belief is unfounded assumption. Assume one false thing and any false thing can be proved true. Thus it undermines our rationality.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Much of what we use to navigate the world is based on unfounded assumptions, belief is in no way unique.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: People may choose certain foods because they think they are healthier without going through the process of verifying it.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: It is very easy to verify whether a food is healthy or not by looking at the nutritional information. That people do not do so is bad.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: People assume a certain street or route may be less dangerous or assume someone may intend harm and avoid that person or place, even if those beliefs are not founded or verified.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: People are willing to believe that a politician will bring jobs and vote for him or her, even if they have not verified it.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Believing that a politician will bring jobs is typically a verifiable claim and that people do not verify it is indeed a bad thing.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Not every politician has a history that shows success or failure at creating jobs.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.2.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.1.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6. Con: The fact that it is difficult to live without making unfounded assumptions doesn't mean that any particular unfounded assumption is a good thing.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1. Pro: Unfounded assumptions come with varying degrees of unfoundedness and consequence. The higher the unfoundedness and the consequence the less sound is the assumption.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Religions often present what appears to be a lot of foundation, an entire book and other items. However they usually also request a lot of unfounded assumptions and the consequences of making the unfounded assumptions are often substantial.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.1. Con: The foundation presented can be the result of centuries of cherry picking the most consistent passages from supporters while destroying opposing/inconsistent views and/or killing or imprisoning or ostracizing the inconvenient authors. Thus even those facts that can be verified can be considered to amount to anecdotal evidence at best.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2. Pro: Most religions use the you-have-nothing-to-lose-by-believing argument. Of course you do: There's your time, your independence, your objectivity, and your cash.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: If one is believing in religion purely because they have nothing to lose or to hedge bets then it is not a genuine belief and one loses their intellectual integrity. At the same time an omniscient deity would surely know that the belief is not genuine.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2. Pro: Much time is spent praying. Though many say their prayers are answered, evidence of a causal link between their prayers and the outcome that occurred is lacking.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: [Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_on_intercessory_prayer) have shown prayer has no effect beyond placebo.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: It's worse than that you've also wasted your time.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.2. Con: Praying may have consequences on [brain](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/18/how-does-prayer-meditation-affect-brain-activity_n_1974621.html) activity, function and structure.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Prayer shows a specific pattern in [brain activity](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104310443), lighting frontal lobes \(that affect concentration\) while parietal lobes go dark. This last area is responsible for sensory experiences and could explain that those praying “lose their sense of self, feel a sense of oneness, a blurring of the boundary between self and other”.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: Those [results](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104310443) were consistent with different religious practitioners, from Franciscan nuns praying to Buddhists meditating or Sikhs chanting.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.2.1.2. Con: These results would have been found when the subjects knew that they and their brain activity were being observed. So these results are as \(or less\) normal as behavior on reality TV shows.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2944261/) with Buddhist monks suggests that "over the course of meditating for tens of thousands of hours, the long-term practitioners had actually altered the structure and function of their brains".
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.2.2.1. Con: The average religious believer and practitioner may not have the same commitment, tools and training as Buddhist monks to be able to achieve such results.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Any form or degree of [positive thinking](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/positive-thinking/art-20043950) or [meditation](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104310443) is beneficial for the human mind.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.2.3. Con: [Neuroplasticity](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104310443), the capacity of our brains to change and adapt, is not a unique characteristic of religion but of extreme concentration and 'mental trainning'.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.2.3.1. Pro: The more someone can [focus](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104310443) on something "math or auto racing or football or God", the more that becomes their own reality, as it  "becomes written into the neural connections of your brain", experts say.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.3. Pro: Much social power, over the religious and/or to speak or act on their behalf, is ceded to religious leaders.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.4. Pro: Once you make unfounded assumptions that are relevant to your decisions/opinions your ability to make those decisions or draw conclusions objectively is at risk.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5. Pro: Some part of donations to the church may result in charitable work that the giver would otherwise make through different means. However, the efficiency will suffer from [overheads](https://galileounchained.com/2012/05/14/are-churches-more-like-charities-or-country-clubs/): for instance the livelihood of a preacher and his boss, and his boss's boss etc, and the buildings they work and live in, their private jets, the adverts, pomp, and the expensive art that adorns their window-frames, walls, ceilings or vaults, and legal fees.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1. Pro: Many religious institutions exist mainly for financial gain, and some are corrupt.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Most of the world’s [biggest landowners](http://www.businessinsider.com/worlds-biggest-landowners-2011-3) are monarchs from countries with official state religions that support the monarchy or heads of religions themselves.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: Heads of state in [Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_Qatar), [Kuwait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_Kuwait), [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_Saudi_Arabia), [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_Jordan), [Oman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_Oman) and [Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Morocco) are among the biggest landowners of the world and and all of their countries have an official state religion \(Islam\).
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1.1.2. Pro: Despite having freedom of religion, monarchies in [Bhutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_Bhutan) and [Swaziland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Swaziland), also among the biggest world’s lawnowners, are very tied to Buddhism and Christianity, respectively.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1.1.3. Pro: The [Catholic Church](http://www.businessinsider.com/worlds-biggest-landowners-2011-3#3-pope-benedict-13), with Pope Benedict at its head, is considered to be the third biggest landowner of the world.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1.1.4. Pro: [Queen Elizabeth II](http://www.businessinsider.com/worlds-biggest-landowners-2011-3#2-king-abdullah-of-saudi-arabia-14), UK’s monarch and Head of State, is considered to be the biggest landowner of the world.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1.1.5. Pro: With the conversion of the emperor Constantine to Christianity, the Catholic Church became one of the largest landowners of ancient times and during the Middle Ages, the Church controlled [vast amounts of wealth](https://www.timemaps.com/encyclopedia/medieval-europe-church-history/) and was again the largest landowner in Europe.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1.1.5.1. Pro: Some authors consider that the fact that [catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerical_celibacy_\(Catholic_Church\)#Theological_and_scriptural_foundations) priests are required to be [celibate](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/03/opinion/secrets-celibacy-and-the-church.html) and single \(by regulations, not dogma\) may have had the intention to avoid priests being able to pass [money](https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/696) and property to their [offspring](http://www.natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives/041202/041202s.htm).
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1.2. Pro: The documented case of [Scientology](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80037110?trackId=13752289&tctx=0%2C1%2C6ccc21398a999e39b4d069b8742cab02a81834b8%3Ace194af7eee2b9205b5d5383e93956d1aa4bb159%2C%2C)
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1.3. Pro: The idea of the [prosperity gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology) has been spreading in the US in recent times and the main idea behind it is that donating money to religious institutions will make you healthier and wealthier in the long run.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1.3.1. Pro: As a result of the prosperity gospel many [megachurch](http://dustoffthebible.com/Blog-archive/2015/10/28/15-religious-leaders-that-make-more-money-getting-out-of-bed-than-youll-make-all-year/) [leaders](https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/13/living/creflo-dollar-jet-feat/index.html) have their own private jets and exorbitant amounts of money while their congregations remain impoverished or at average income.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.3. Pro: A lot of the foundation is often unfounded itself, frequently based on other unfounded assumptions in a web that can be difficult to unravel, thus disguising the ultimate unfoundedness of much of it.
1.2.6.4.2. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that those gaps being filled with place holders and superstitions was necessary for our survival and evolution.
1.2.6.4.3. Con: Heads of religions recognize only the parts of science which fit the description of the world they already give to the masses. All other science is called "sacrilege" and "untrue" and the proponents are persecuted. That narrows fields of scientific research and slows down the spread of new discoveries. Examples: [Book burning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_burning#Christian_burnings), [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei), [Charles Darwin](http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/0/22078983).
1.2.6.4.3.1. Pro: With religions often claiming things contrary to science, it can not only encourage irrational thought, but encourage to the point of normalizing anti-science attitudes such as climate change denial.
1.2.6.4.3.2. Pro: For example, many Christians [believe](https://www.livescience.com/46123-many-americans-creationists.html) the world is 10,000 years old.
1.2.7. Con: The evolutionary advantage may have been that if you went along with the dominant religion you would not be murdered by the dominant religion.
1.2.8. Pro: Religion was probably indispensable for most of human history in that it [improved the strength](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Evolutionary_psychology_of_religion#/Religion_as_an_adaptation) of small groups to outcompete other groups.
1.2.8.1. Con: This is classic "others must fail" thinking. How would a religious group outperform the non-religious? By ostracizing or killing them or forcing them to comply. The fact that there was a victor does not mean that overall efficiency was raised.
1.2.8.1.1. Con: Before the advent of modern ethics, a religious group had a significant advantage on the level of moral compliance of its members \(because of divine omniscience\), thus outperforming in the overall cooperation.
1.2.8.2. Con: Competition is a good thing where it leads to progress, but religions do not change so when a religious group wins progress is less likely.
1.2.8.2.1. Con: Religions are constantly changing. The rate of change is slow, but that is a positive because it forces new ideas to be tested sufficiently before the new ideas are accepted.
1.2.8.2.1.1. Con: Religion is dogmatic in nature since it believes it is divinely inspired. As such the changes it makes is when it acquiesces to secular moral pressure and the large amount of time this takes prolongs oppression.
1.2.8.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.
1.2.8.3. Pro: [According](https://righteousmind.com/) to [Jonahtan Haidt's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Righteous_Mind) [research](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/22/righteous-mind-jonathan-haidt-review), [religion](https://www.edge.org/conversation/jonathan_haidt-moral-psychology-and-the-misunderstanding-of-religion) may have been part of [human](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/the-righteous-mind-by-jonathan-haidt.html) evolution, making group-level evolution possible through cooperation, by way of morality. Without beliefs in omniscient judges of morality, it may have never been applied.
1.2.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.
1.2.8.4. Pro: Shared religions with "big gods" that see everything and punish moral transgressions in the afterlife was initially needed to achieve trust between strangers who would otherwise cheat and exploit each other. This [makes larger societies possible](https://religiousstudiesproject.com/2014/03/05/an-outline-of-norenzayans-big-gods-by-michael-doane/), causing such religions to [spread and gain dominance through "cultural evolution"](https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/joe-henrich-culture-evolution-weird-psychology-social-norms-9756a97850ce).
1.2.8.4.1. Con: Trusting and [social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociality) [behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_animal_behavior) is seen in animals who presumably have no gods.
1.2.8.4.2. Pro: One of the goals of religion isn't to make you good but to remind you that you can be. If we agree on this it means that humans can also be bad. If the counter to 'bad' people in a state is the court and police. Then for the world it is God.
1.2.8.4.2.1. Con: Suppose every country ceded its sovereignty to the UN and they drew up a common set of laws for us all. Then the counter to all bad people would be court. The fact that the legal systems are separate does not mean that there is a god above them.
1.2.8.4.2.2. Con: Since crime is prevalent all over the world it would appear that God is not an effective counter to bad people in this world.
1.2.8.4.3. Con: Human settlements grew into civilizations because of [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_agriculture#Civilizations). Why they settled down from being nomadic tribes is up for debate but they were already living in social groups without developing into large societies until the development of agriculture.
1.2.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.3.
1.2.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.
1.2.8.7. Con: -> See 1.2.8.4.3.
1.2.9. Pro: Much of the practices of religion are conducive towards good mental health. It is therefore likely that religion has been a good mediator of mental health for humans.
1.2.9.1. Con: If we know these practice are good for mental health, we can just do them because science tells us that they are good. On the other hand, since religion requires no experimental justification, it could tell us to do something that is horrible for mental health, and we could not protest like we can with scientific conclusions.
1.2.9.2. Pro: Religious participation among young people [is correlated](https://www.hoover.org/research/religion-and-economic-development) with a lower probability of substance abuse and juvenile delinquency
1.2.9.3. Pro: In terms of physical health, research points that religiosity is related to a decrease in smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as having positive effects on heart disease and blood pressure.
1.2.9.3.1. Pro: Longevity seems to also be [improved](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705681/) by religion \(especially in men\) and there is negative correlation between religiosity and suicide.
1.2.9.3.1.1. Con: Religious prohibition of suicide can adequately explain the correlation, but fear of damnation does not adress the problem.
1.2.9.4. Con: Religious beliefs and practices often contribute to the development of certain psychiatric disorders.
1.2.9.4.1. Pro: Some [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705681/) point at greater anxiety in religious individuals and lower self-esteem when their religion portrays an image if a punitive and vindictive God.
1.2.9.4.1.1. Con: There is certain lack of proper studies between religiosity and mental health. Some research suggest lower [anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705681/) among religious individuals and higher self-esteem when God is portrayed as loving.
1.2.9.4.2. Pro: On [sexual disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705681/), research points that male patients are more likely to come from religious homes.
1.2.9.4.3. Pro: [Hinduism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705681/) in India is a contributing factor in conditions such obsession, anxiety and depression.
1.2.9.4.4. Pro: [Research](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6615/d7c1d806fdf8e19c71a1e2df5e26a85b4776.pdf) in the US points that Catholics and Protestants have “higher levels of maladaptive interpersonal guilt than those with no religious affiliation”.
1.2.9.4.5. Pro: Certain aspects of [Christian beliefs](https://www.salon.com/2014/11/01/the_sad_twisted_truth_about_conservative_christianitys_effect_on_the_mind_partner/) and Christian living can lead to depression, anxiety and panic attacks.
1.2.9.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.2.
1.2.9.5. Con: If something happens to shake a person's faith their entire world could fall apart. This would make their faith and religion ultimately detrimental to their mental health.
1.2.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.3.
1.2.9.7. Con: Religion simply justifies the bad things carried out in the name of religion, enabling the wrong-doer to continue with no remorse and the promise of maintaining a place in heaven.
1.2.9.7.1. Pro: Celibacy can have a negative impact on mental health and may be a contributing factor in sexual abuse.
1.2.9.7.1.1. Pro: Among some religious creeds [child abuse and neglect](https://www.salon.com/2014/11/01/the_sad_twisted_truth_about_conservative_christianitys_effect_on_the_mind_partner/) is more common when certain variables are found: authoritarianism, isolation and fear.
1.2.9.7.1.2. Pro: Sexual abuse carried out by priests creates deep trauma in the victims.
1.2.9.7.1.2.1. Pro: Several religious schools are filled with accusations of child [abuse](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/20/child-abuse-catholic-schools-ireland). In Ireland girls were sexually abused in catholic schools. In Canada the United Church committed numerous physical [abuses](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/02/world/indian-lawsuits-on-school-abuse-may-bankrupt-canada-churches.html) against indigenous children.  Christian run schools [prohibited](https://sojo.net/articles/time-acknowledgement-christian-run-native-american-boarding-schools-left-legacy-destruction) native children to speak their languages and continue with their cultural practices. All over the world there are legal proceedings against priests who run religious schools and abused the children that attended them.
1.2.9.7.1.3. Pro: Sexual abstinence is not per se unhealthy but it can be [psychologically harmful](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2014/07/07/is-abstinence-unhealthy) when an individual wishes to have sex and does not, according to researchers.
1.2.9.7.1.3.1. Pro: Studies have found that [regular sex](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2014/07/07/is-abstinence-unhealthy) has a protective effect on the heart, lowering the risk of heart attack in men. For men and women, “it increases blood flow to the genitals and probably helps the immune system”.
1.2.9.7.1.3.2. Pro: Psychotherapist and former Benedictine priest A.W. Richard Sipe wrote about the great loneliness, depression, and emotional distress that can come from struggling with [prolonged celibacy](https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/examining-crisis/reality-celibate-life-reflections-henri-nouwen).
1.2.9.7.1.3.3. Pro: Richard Sipe conducted a [study](https://www.medicaldaily.com/popes-celibacy-rule-how-abstinence-affects-priests-psychological-health-244715) of US celibate Catholic clerics \(1960 to 1985\), and found that half of all priests and  brothers were [sexually](http://www.awrsipe.com/Articles/Knowledge%20of%20sexual%20activity.html) active at any particular time. Masturbation was the most frequent sexual activity, followed by affairs with women, sex with male companions, and Internet pornography.
1.2.9.7.1.4. Pro: A conservative Irish newspaper proposed that celibacy had [contributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_on_the_causes_of_clerical_child_abuse) to the abuse problem within the church and an Australian public inquiry panel claimed that priests being celibate may have also contributed to abuse.
1.2.9.7.1.5. Pro: A [report](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/13/catholic-sexual-abuse-partly-caused-by-celibacy-and-secrecy-report-finds), which looked at the findings of 26 royal commissions and other inquiries from Australia, Ireland, the UK, Canada and the Netherlands since 1985, found that mandatory celibacy and a culture of secrecy contributed to minors sexual abuse.
1.2.9.7.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.3.1.
1.2.9.7.1.6. Con: John Jay researchers reported that about 4 % of the 110,000 priests studied had been accused of sexual misconduct involving children. There is no consensus about the sexual abuse among the general American male population, but estimates are 1 in 10 men or close to 5% and thus [the rate of abuse by Catholic priests is not higher](http://www.newsweek.com/priests-commit-no-more-abuse-other-males-70625) than the national estimates.
1.2.9.7.1.6.1. Con: The study was "[authorized and is being paid for by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops](http://www.newsweek.com/priests-commit-no-more-abuse-other-males-70625)".
1.2.9.7.1.6.2. Con: The 4% doesn't account for the accomplices who covered it up. Convicted layers of authority have reached [at least two levels](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/philip-wilson-roman-catholic-church-child-sex-abuse-jail-sentence-australia-newcastle-philip-wilson-a8428171.html) above the initial perpetrator.
1.2.9.7.2. Pro: Child-marriages carried out or endorsed by many religions produce terrible mental health consequences for the victims.
1.2.9.7.2.1. Pro: A US Marriage Survey conducted in 2011 recorded responses from girls involved in child marriages from Hindu, Buddhist, Catholic, Baptist, Muslim, and other [faiths](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/child-marriage-and-religion-in-the-united-states).
1.2.9.7.2.2. Con: A [study](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/child-marriage-and-religion-in-the-united-states) with more than 500 child and adult forced marriage in the US found that no major religion promotes child marriage.
1.2.9.7.2.2.1. Con: However, among sects who force generally young girls to marry older men, [religious reasons](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/child-marriage-and-religion-in-the-united-states) are used to coerce the children.
1.2.9.7.2.3. Pro: Top Saudi [Muslim cleric](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/17/saudi.child.marriage/index.html?iref=newssearch) said; "A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong and they are being unfair to her".
1.2.9.7.2.4. Con: Child marriage is not a [religious](https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/can-religious-leaders-best-allies-end-child-marriage/) problem but a cultural one. Countries with similar religious devotion have very different rates of child marriages.
1.2.9.7.2.4.1. Con: However, religious texts can be and are often used to [condone](https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/can-religious-leaders-best-allies-end-child-marriage/) child marriage; religious laws often allow minors to marry and deference to religious customs have often stopped [laws](https://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/05/christie_rejects_ban_on_marriage_for_nj_teens_unde.html) from protecting minors' rights.
1.2.9.8. Con: The fear of hell can lead to intense feelings of guilt for insignificant events or actions that are deemed acceptable by society writ large.
1.2.9.8.1. Pro: Many religious people in the LGBT community feel intense fear, guilt, and cognitive dissonance due to their own nature being seen as sinful.
1.2.9.8.2. Con: In [every](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/10/most-americans-believe-in-heaven-and-hell/) Christian denomination in America, belief in a Heaven is stronger than a belief in a Hell.
1.2.9.8.2.1. Con: While 72% of Americans say to believe in Heaven, 58% of adults also believe in Hell, which makes for a large number of people who can fear that sins in this life will condemn them in the afterlife.
1.2.9.8.2.2. Con: US [Christians](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/10/most-americans-believe-in-heaven-and-hell/), compared with non-Christians and the unaffiliated, are more likely to believe in both afterlife destinations.
1.2.9.8.2.3. Con: [The Apocalypsis Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation) has spread a sense of imminent destruction of our planet, blaming a god's decision; instead of raising a meditation about the consequences of our decisions and lifestyle.
1.2.9.8.3. Pro: [Surveys](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-beliefs-poll/belief-in-a-supreme-being-strong-worldwide-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSTRE73O24K20110425) [show](http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/belief-in-hell/) large numbers of people believe in hell. A [Gallup international poll](http://gallup-international.bg/en/Publications/2017/373-Religion-prevails-in-the-world) suggests that 49% of people believe in hell.
1.2.9.8.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.2.
1.2.10. Pro: Religion led people to do things correctly before science and technology caught up.
1.2.10.1. Con: Tradition can be observed and judged separate from religion. Good traditions not necessarily reflect good religion and vice versa.
1.2.10.2. Pro: Before modern states could provide welfare, religion was the only source of education, healthcare or economic relief.
1.2.10.2.1. Pro: Hospitals were founded, financed, and staffed by religions. An old [French term](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_hospitals) for hospital is hôtel-Dieu, "hostel of God."
1.2.10.2.2. Pro: Religious organizations build schools \(and universities\), orphanages, and other services for community benefits.
1.2.10.2.2.1. Pro: Religious organizations have to debate their claims, because of their universal vocation. To be able to stand in a plural contest and argue has its specific pedagogical value.
1.2.10.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.9.7.1.2.1.
1.2.10.2.4. Con: The family was also a source of education, healthcare, and economic relief.
1.2.10.2.5. Pro: Judaic religious tradition has throughout history [emphasised education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_education) which has been an advantage to its adherents at places and times where illiteracy was the norm, for example in [Europe in the early middle ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy#Ancient_and_post-classical_literacy).
1.2.10.2.5.1. Con: Judaic education in reading was historically reserved for boys.
1.2.10.2.6. Pro: The Catholic Church was the only institution in Europe during several hundred years that actively contributed to free education for the masses.
1.2.10.2.6.1. Pro: The Church also mandated in 1179 [free education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education#Education_in_ancient_civilization) for the poor, so every cathedral had a master to teach boys too poor to pay the regular fee, planting the seed of modern universal and public education.
1.2.10.3. Con: Religion also taught people to do many things wrong. Such as exorcism for mental illness, human sacrifice to appease gods, and relying on faith healing instead of medicine.
1.2.10.3.1. Con: Faith healing can be viewed as producing a [placebo effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo).
1.2.10.3.1.1. Con: Since Placebo effects typically do not fix the underlying condition and only act as a bandage for the problem this is not necessarily a good thing.
1.2.10.3.2. Con: Rituals can have a [Causal impact](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-rituals-work/) on people’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
1.2.10.3.3. Pro: Amputating a working body part, the male [foreskin](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/malecircumcision/religions_1.shtml), is an excellent example of something wrong being forced and enforced by religion.
1.2.10.4. Con: Religion just fills the holes and gaps until science discovers the answers and as such stifled inquiry.
1.2.10.5. Con: Arguing that religions have done some good is easy but almost everything leads to some amount of good. It is more useful to argue that religion has caused a net amount of good but doing this calculation is very hard and thus it is almost impossible to conclusively show that religion has been a good thing overall.
1.2.10.6. Con: These "correct things" can easily be derived from observation and do not require a system of religious belief to be enforced.
1.2.10.6.1. Pro: Religion occupies advancements as if it was the sole inventor even after centuries of resistance to them.
1.2.10.6.2. Con: Jewish dietary and hygiene laws had an entire people group treating germs and bacteria correctly for many thousands of years before germs and bacteria were discovered \(which famously led them to be remarkably unaffected by the Black Plague among other things\).
1.2.10.6.2.1. Con: Although some religions helped to disseminate hygiene rules, this was not always true. The Roman practice of public baths [was seen as 'sinful' by early christians](https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1126&context=younghistorians), who abhorred nudity and went on a crusade against what was seen as a pagan luxury. The condemnation was not unanimous, but it was prevailing.
1.2.10.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.6.2.
1.2.10.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.
1.2.10.9. Con: In the past, religion in society was the norm. Choosing to lead a non-religious life was, very likely, not an easy choice to make at that time. In such a non-plural  environment, it would be a fallacy to say that "Religion led people to act correctly..." because there was no testable alternative to see if a non-religious life was "more correct" or "less correct" than a religious lifestyle.
1.2.10.9.1. Con: The fact that there will be few to no examples of records of non-religious life does not mean that we can't analyse the religion.
1.2.10.10. Con: Where religion led people to do things correctly it was either by accident \(i.e. despite the unfounded assumptions\) or where dogma was based on scientific observation rather than other dogma.
1.2.11. Pro: From caveman [rituals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_religion) to the worship of the [Pharaoh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh) as a man God of ancient Egypt, religion as a whole has evolved throughout history. Rituals are a cornerstone of human conduct and help bind together a society.
1.2.12. Con: Schopenhauer takes the position that the very best thing for humankind is not to have been born at all, follower very close behind by a swift death. If this is true, then any culture or development which has prolonged human existence is categorically bad for humanity.
1.2.13. Pro: Religion was a [necessary step](http://www.religioustolerance.org/ashby01.htm) to reach structured thoughts and rationality. In fact, the scientific method is only a young leaf \(although emergent\) in the [evolutionary tree](https://believervsnonbelievers.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/246da14db63537a20f5cdc6e50e38e86.jpg) of belief systems.
1.2.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.
1.2.13.2. Con: The opposite may also be true. The [Greek civilisation](https://education.onehowto.com/article/the-origin-of-philosophy-the-transition-from-myth-to-logos-2313.html) starts explaining the world through religious myths, until philosophers consider it necessary to find a more rational explanation \(logos\) starting a strong tradition of Western rationalism.
1.2.13.2.1. Con: Recent [scholars](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40647-016-0144-9) point that the [transition](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41722132?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) from 'myth' to 'logos' was a continuum, so rational and mythical explanations were never in conflict.
1.2.13.2.1.1. Pro: Having a global understanding of the universe, although possibly filled by irrational beliefs, is an important part of our psyche. It uses intuition and pattern recognition to make decisions and solve problems. The other process thinks rationally, limits the context to what is already known to work and can be articulated precisely.

Although there is some debate on the [lateralization of those processes](http://ssh://git\@git.sarbakan.com:10023/mobility-ware/destination-solitaire/solitaire-customer-tool-frontend.git), [both are important part of your brains mechanisms](https://youtu.be/OxslBI3hNFQ?t=2943) and are in no way mutually exclusive.
1.2.13.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.2.13.2.2. Pro: Pre-socratic [philosophers](https://www.thoughtco.com/greek-mythology-pre-socratic-philosophy-112518) rejected the notion of natural and supernatural and Aristotle using  evidence and observation, marked the distinction between philosophy and empirical science.
1.2.13.2.3. Con: That does not mean that religion has not prepared our brain and helped structure our thoughts for thousands of years before being able to transition to logic.
1.2.13.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.
1.2.13.2.3.2. Con: Althought they might have helped transfer knowledge and wisdom, Embryonic repertoires of stories were not necessarily large enough to be considered Religions.
1.2.13.2.3.3. Con: It is more likely that structured thinking evolved from intercomunicating useful information. There is no need for religion to explain this process.
1.2.13.2.3.3.1. Pro: Take animals for instance. We may observe the evolution of their thinking process \(different evolutionary branches at different stages of intelligence\), and yet animals don't seem to perform any religious activities. The conclusion is that the evolution of thought is independent from existence of religion.
1.2.13.2.3.4. Con: Religious dogma does not take well to inquiry and knowledge advancement. [Anaxagoras](https://www.iep.utm.edu/anaxagor/), a Presocratic philosopher may well have not started the revolution of thinking that led away from mythology had he been executed for "Impiety" as ordered by the Athenian court
1.2.13.2.3.4.1. Con: Societies organised around religious values provide a stable framework for their citizens to be safe and comfortable enough in order to contemplate their own thinking, which can then lead to innovations.
1.2.13.2.3.4.1.1. Con: Inventions by prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies \(tools and curing technologies\) were innovations increasing the stability/well-being of all tribe members. There is no evidence for a key role of religious values in these societies; basic human needs and the objective benefits of cooperation can account for these innovations.
1.2.13.3. Pro: Religions are both good and bad.  They form part of the evolution of modern society towards greater humanity and a growing awareness of our individual vulnerability and interdependence. This period of human development, while incomplete, is slowly coming to an end as religious belief declines.
1.2.13.4. Pro: Regrouping behind common archetypal [ideals](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001?journalCode=rrbb20) increases coordination, cooperation and chances for survival and reproduction.
1.2.13.4.1. Con: Religion fragments the commonality of each state and other organisations to those who are of the religion and those who are not, thus reducing coordination and cooperation. For instance there are multiple examples of religious groups not cooperating with local law enforcement or defying local law, which has been known to result in loss of life or liberty.
1.2.13.5. Con: The quoted "[evolutionary tree](https://believervsnonbelievers.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/246da14db63537a20f5cdc6e50e38e86.jpg)" includes sciences in myths and religions, which is substantially wrong.
1.2.13.6. Con: [The Brief History of Human Spiritual Evolution](http://www.religioustolerance.org/ashby01.htm) only points out how beliefs evolved into one another, there is no causal connection to evolution of critical thought and rationality.
1.2.13.7. Con: The quoted "[evolutionary tree](https://believervsnonbelievers.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/246da14db63537a20f5cdc6e50e38e86.jpg)" provides a footnote that claims that it "should not be counted as fact".
1.2.13.8. Pro: James Kennedy and Jerry Newcombe argue that science has its roots in Christianity. Because it is based on the notion that there exists a rational God who is the source of rational truth. This, they argue, [gave rise to the possibility of scientific laws](http://www.faithfacts.org/christ-and-the-culture/the-impact-of-christianity).
1.2.13.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.21.1.2.4.
1.2.13.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.1.2.5.
1.2.13.8.3. Con: Despite  previous connections between religion and thought in the Middle Ages, the birth of [modern philosophy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Western-philosophy/Medieval-philosophy) in the West comes from the total separation of faith and reason.
1.2.13.8.3.1. Pro: Enlightenment philosophers even considered that the Church's doctrines were “superstitious” and had “hindered the [progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_of_Christianity_in_civilization#Letters_and_learning) of civilization”.
1.2.13.9. Con: Religion was a useless step to reach structured thoughts and rationality as "God" is the easy answer to everything we don't know. What science does, is to explore all the possibilities to get to the answer.
1.2.13.9.1. Pro: Religion didn't help in developing structured thoughts, intelectual people did, and some of them turned out to be religious, but that's nothing more than an anecdote.
1.2.13.10. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.
1.2.14. Pro: There is a hypothesis called the [God Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_gene) that asserts that humans are predisposed towards spirituality and religion due to a specific Gene.
1.2.14.1. Con: The God gene hypothesis is heavily criticised by clerics and scientists alike and is only one of many factors leading to various "esoteric" convictions, including the belief in ESP. [Carl Zimmer](https://carlzimmer.com/faith-boosting-genes-472/) points out how the study is fundamentally flawed.
1.2.15. Pro: We had both religious and atheistic people exist for as long as we know [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_religion) . But for some reason the atheists never developed pre-scientific civilization. Considering the vast number of samples, that can't possibly be coincidence.
1.2.15.1. Con: Atheism was not as tenable a position to hold until science began explaining things previously thought to have been caused by gods.
1.2.15.2. Con: Atheism was a [capital offense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_atheism) in many ancient civilizations. As such the reason atheists never developed their own pre-scientific civilizations is because they were persecuted by the religious majority.
1.2.16. Pro: Religion provides a reassuring answer to the great questions of life, such as the meaning of life, post-mortem life, and solutions to our problems such as suffering, injustice, fear of death, and therefore natural necessity for mankind, thus arose independently in different cultures.
1.2.17. Con: Religions are still beneficial because they had been evolutionary advantageous so most of the mankind who survived still tend to be prone to religion. Today's societies have more advanced means of organising themselves.
1.2.17.1. Con: Being gullible is not a survival skill, as can be attested to by anyone whose life savings have been removed by a confidence trick, including spouses whose spouse emptied their joint bank account and gave it to a religion.
1.3. Con: Many religious institutions are corrupt and exploit the vulnerable for financial gain.
1.3.1. Con: Corrupt institutions as a phenomenon are not exclusive to religious ones, not even when counted among other institutions that are held to a higher standard \(like, for example [legal](http://www.acfe.com/fraud-examiner.aspx?id=4294994669) [institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_corruption), [ethics faculties](https://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/yale-ethics-professor?utm_term=.miGxmLa1p#.qaEyr6BoO), [charities](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43112200) and even [hippie communes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manson_Family)\).
1.3.1.1. Con: Some religions rather than just having corrupt officials or having corrupted ideals were founded as rackets to begin with. This sets them apart from corrupt governments and legal systems.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Some religions appear to have been designed largely to accumulate wealth and status for their creators.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: There is [reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard#Rise_of_Scientology) to believe that Scientology may have been founded to provide financial gain for L.R. Hubbard.
1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1.3.
1.3.1.2. Con: The fact that there is corruption in other institutions does not diminish the importance of corruption in religion.
1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1.
1.3.3. Pro: Since the first tribal witch doctor, religion has instigated, fed, and leached off of unchecked fear and greed. Fear and greed are religion's weapons used to keep the ignorant tightly locked in the shackles of their control. At the earliest age, religion teaches to fear God and his punishment for disobedience. Then it strokes the greed of these fearful ignorant by dangling an unproven carrot of reward and bliss after this life thereby keeping them under their control.
1.3.4. Pro: Many religions are rife with hypocrisy: they teach compassion and austerity but remain [incredibly wealthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_organizations) while much of the world lives in poverty.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Jesus is [clearly quoted](https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=niv:Matthew.19:23%E2%80%9326:23) as saying that it is easier for a camel to fit through the [eye of a needle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_a_needle) than for a wealthy person to enter heaven.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Jesus was saying it is difficult but not impossible for the wealthy to enter heaven. The "eye of the needle" in biblical days refered to any opening that was narrow and possibly short making passage difficult. [Eye of the needle examples.](http://www.biblicalhebrew.com/nt/camelneedle.htm) [Eye of the needle pictures.](https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=eye+of+the+needle+in+israel&FORM=QBIR)
1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Even if Jesus did not mean it was impossible for the wealthy to enter heaven, the implication of the verse, and how it is generally interpreted, is that wealth and material possession should not be an end goal.
1.3.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Jesus apparently [replied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_a_needle) to a young rich man "if you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me".
1.3.4.2. Con: [Plenty](https://franciscanmissionaries.com/priests-take-vow-poverty/) of clergy, and other religious followers, do take vows of poverty.
1.3.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1.1.5.
1.3.4.4. Pro: With the manpower and resources that religion has, hunger and poverty should have already been abolished, but religious selfless acts tend to favor only the ones within their communities.
1.3.4.5. Pro: Mother Theresa was allegedly a saint for the poor, yet she believed they should [suffer for God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Mother_Teresa). However, when she was sick, she had to have top of the end medical care. The church still touts her as a saint.
1.3.4.5.1. Pro: -> See discussion #16522: Mother Teresa should not have been canonized.
1.3.4.5.2. Pro: Mother Teresa has been accused of using her charities to [forcefully convert](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/22/mother-teresa-tried-to-brainwash-hindus-to-become-christians-and/) the poor and vulnerable.
1.3.4.5.2.1. Pro: Mother Teresa [instructed](https://books.google.ie/books?id=N4UxVZNER5EC&pg=PA135&lpg=PA135&dq=mother+teresa+baptism+dying&source=bl&ots=Z0uGNIRpQw&sig=jtnmcDt3YClUsGrf6K79K_LZ9UE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EwXtVOH8Aci7ggSChIKoAg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=mother%20teresa%20baptism%20dying&f=false) nuns to baptise those who were about to die even when they had no knowledge of the Church's teachings.
1.3.4.5.2.1.1. Con: If a person does not believe in the sacrament of baptism, then the act of forced baptism is little more than having a small amount of water poured over their head.
1.3.4.5.2.1.1.1. Con: A person of a different religious faith would find the act of forced baptism to be an affront to their particular faith and would likely find the situation distressing.
1.3.4.5.2.1.1.2. Con: Forced baptism is not necessarily against the teachings of the Catholic Church.
1.3.4.5.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Babies are regularly baptised despite being unable to consent to the sacrament.
1.3.4.5.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: An inability to give affirmative consent to being baptised as a baby is not the same as being forcibly baptised against one's will as an adult \(or older child\) who has expressed that will, the latter of which can be very distressing.
1.3.4.5.2.1.1.3. Con: Even if the patient doesn't believe what the baptism represents, the church would still take credit for a "conversion", if it was documented. These "conversions" serve to unfairly bolster the membership in numbers argument of the church and it could be claimed that the Church acted in self-interest.
1.3.4.5.2.2. Pro: Mother Teresa conspired to [“brainwash”](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/22/mother-teresa-tried-to-brainwash-hindus-to-become-christians-and/) Hindus into Christianity and helped fuel a violent military insurgency in India’s northeast according to Yogi Adityanath, an outspoken MP in the current BJP government.
1.3.4.5.2.3. Con: Mother Teresa did not see "active" evangelism as a necessary component of her ministry to the poor, writing "We never try to convert those who receive \[aid from Missionaries of Charity\] to Christianity but in our work we bear witness to the love of God’s presence..." \([Life in the Spirit: Reflections, Meditations and Prayers, pp. 81-82](https://www.challies.com/articles/the-myth-of-mother-teresa/)\).
1.3.4.5.2.4. Con: Mother Teresa [encouraged](https://www.challies.com/articles/the-myth-of-mother-teresa/) dying Hindus to pray to their own gods, revealing her universalist beliefs. It is unlikely that such a person would also coerce conversions.
1.3.4.5.3. Pro: Mother Teresa did not provide noteworthy healthcare to her patients, instead allowing them to [suffer and die](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/18/the-dark-side-of-mother-teresa/), as she believed that was God's will.
1.3.4.5.3.1. Pro: She[believed](http://allthatsinteresting.com/mother-teresa-saint) the suffering of the poor and sick was more of a glory than a burden.
1.3.4.5.3.1.1. Con: Mother Teresa believed that suffering- as Jesus did on the cross- could be an important religious experience, bringing the poor closer to God. While this belief may be ethically objectionable in a secular context, it is also likely [consistent with Catholic teaching](https://www.catholicparents.org/redemptive-suffering/) and therefore should not prevent her canonisation.
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.1. Con: While the acceptance of some inevitable suffering may be an aspect of Catholic teaching, parables like that of the Good Samaritan also call for Catholics to [do all they can](https://www.thedivinemercy.org/news/Does-Catholicism-Revel-In-Suffering-3633) to alleviate the suffering of others.
1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.
1.3.6. Pro: Corruption spread through some religions as its leaders sought financial and social gain.
1.3.6.1. Pro: The Catholic church's practice of financial 'indulgences' which could be used to pay-off sin were [widely abused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence#Late_medieval_abuses).
1.3.6.2. Pro: Social gain would include [abuse](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/20/child-abuse-catholic-schools-ireland).
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.3.1.
1.3.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1.3.1.
1.3.6.4. Pro: The Catholic church in Spain \(from 1998-2015\) had the prerogative to [register](https://web.a.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=0021325X&AN=77784385&h=FsNAGZXp%2bxSh7arhDsHdYnlP5LNZ5DRMVnzpZoP4lB4UtyIxm%2fJNjE96NfNcM5xBFIsfUKKkgy%2f%2bJYYNxuTlPQ%3d%3d&crl=c&resultNs=AdminWebAuth&resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d0021325X%26AN%3d77784385) properties under its name. In that time, an estimated [4,500 properties](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eldiario.es%2Fsociedad%2Finmobiliario-Iglesia-descubierto-prometido-Gobierno_0_651635745.html&edit-text=) were registered including \(aside from worship places\) schools, garages, farming lands and houses. None of those buildings incur property taxes since the Church is exempt.
1.3.6.4.1. Pro: The Law established that government officials were the ones to register properties but also had the exemption of allowing the Church to do it. While Spain was under a [real estate bubble](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fpolitica.elpais.com%2Fpolitica%2F2013%2F05%2F05%2Factualidad%2F1367768798_397124.html&edit-text=), the Church gained many properties under its name, without publicity or any of the proper channels a private citizen would need, only with the certification of a Bishop and paying ludicrous sums like 30 euros for historic Cordoba’s mosque.
1.3.6.5. Pro: Many spiritual leaders benefit from their patrimonial positions through financial frauds and corruption.[forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterpavlo/2013/11/18/fraud-thriving-in-u-s-churches-but-you-wouldnt-know-it/#304832e1d9d4/)
1.4. Con: Religion has been used as a form of social control.
1.4.1. Con: Religion been used as social control by people. However, it is human nature to misuse certain structures for  personal benefit, therefore the misuse of social control isn't inherent to religion, but to human behavior.
1.4.1.1. Con: It is in the way the structure is created within religions, the structures are undemocratic and leaders are appointed "by god\(s\)", whereby their power becomes absolute.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Most religious teachers, especially those from Abrahamic religions \(for example: [pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope#Election), [imam](https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/2u3mup/question_how_does_one_go_about_becoming_a_imam/), [rabbi](https://www.wikihow.com/Become-a-Rabbi)\) are democratic chosen leaders and there powers are rarely seen as absolute.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The pope [doesn't get](https://www.wikihow.com/Become-Pope) chosen directly by the people \(only a select few cardinals choose\), this process is expressly nontransparent, secretive and nepotistic, thereby non-democratic.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: The Pope, leader of the Roman Catholic  Church, is considered [infallible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_infallibility#cite_note-5) when speaking ex catedra.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: When the Pope speaks "from his chair" as the leader of the faith, his teachings do not need the consent of any other member of the church and are [irreformable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_infallibility#Ex_cathedra).
1.4.1.1.2.2. Con: This is only a bad thing if the people behind the decisions have bad intentions. Besides, if people consider the Pope to be a bad Pope, they create a [Antipope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipope). This has been done several times in Catholic history.
1.4.1.1.2.2.1. Con: From a democratic perspective, having absolute power and being infallible and thus not able to be challenged is a negative aspect on itself, regardless if the person exercising the absolute power have good or bad intentions. Additionally, what can be good for some, can be bad for others.
1.4.1.1.2.2.2. Con: The last time there was an [antipope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipope), as an expression of dissent, was from 1439 to 1449, so it is not a mechanism often used in modern times.
1.4.1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: The modern equivalent of the following of a medieval antipope is the [sedevacantist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedevacantism) that started in the 1960's.
1.4.1.1.2.2.3. Con: Good intentions are not always enough. There's always the possibility of being in error, being misled, feeling constrained by tenets/tradition, being senile, being insane.
1.4.1.2. Con: The structure is such that a religious leader is to teach and the subjects are to accept those teachings and not to question as they are the word of god. The reason we have so many different religions and fractures even in the christian community is because some went against those core beliefs, which is human nature... religion wants those fractures to disappear to create more power in the core beliefs of the hierarchy... \(religion\)
1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.4.3. Pro: Religion organizes and manipulates people in order to make them easier to control.
1.4.3.1. Con: The existence of several thousand protestant denominations imply that religion does not make people easier to control.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Religion has been used by oppressors to make their constituents blindly follow whatever they please on doing.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Religion has served as an opiate for the poor and oppressed - a message of ‘ensure your hardships now and be rewarded in the afterlife’ - robbing these people of a meaningful discourse about their current condition
1.4.3.3. Pro: Religion created God so people could avoid being logical and rational. Since they cannot question anything, they invariably act good. This way, religion acts as a safety valve to stop people from revolting against inequalities.
1.4.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.5.1.
1.4.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.
1.4.3.6. Pro: Religion encourages submission to higher power, which in turn makes people susceptible to manipulation. Individuals should have their own critical thoughts about life instead of relying on an organisation. Individuals should be capable of independent thought, but religion discourages that thought.
1.4.3.7. Pro: Religions were necessary to make people similar enough to be organisable by leaders. With today's technology \(mainly IT\) we may handle much more versatility without chaos.
1.4.3.8. Pro: Religion could teach certain people to believe blindly potentially generating easily-manipulable individuals.
1.4.3.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.5.
1.4.3.10. Pro: Religion uses the fear of what is unknown and what we don't understand yet, to make people do what the heads of religion want.
1.4.3.10.1. Con: Some religions, like Christianity, instill a message of love and not of fear. "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind" [\(Timothy 1:7\)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+1%3A7&version=KJV).
1.4.3.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.
1.4.3.10.3. Pro: Religion has a threatening factor whereby people are instructed to comply to what the spiritual leader tells them to do or else they'd be going to hell, where they will burn eternally for not taking heed of divine instruction.
1.4.3.11. Pro: Religion has a history of monopolizing education and knowledge limiting the perspectives one can be exposed to making them easier to control.
1.4.3.11.1. Pro: Vatican library holds a secret documents which are not available to anyone but high ranked priests or pope. Something which is hidden is considered occult which is the thing they are fighting against so that make up for a contradictory statement. [Vatican Secret Archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_Secret_Archives)
1.4.3.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3.3.
1.4.3.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.2.6.
1.4.3.11.4. Con: Without this monopoly the majority of people would have had no education.
1.4.3.11.5. Pro: Religion tried to play with the monopoly of knowledge, and taught people from a christian church point of view and banned the books that said the oposite.
1.4.3.12. Pro: Religion is often imposed on those young enough to be impressionable, leaving them stuck with it at least until they're old enough to question it, which could be a decade or so, or maybe the rest of their life if they're not that smart.
1.4.3.12.1. Pro: A religion that really wants to promote free thinking, unlike Catholicism, would wait until their potential believers are old enough to commit to the faith and understand everything that it entails.
1.4.4. Pro: Religion has it's hierarchy, many times it leaves "small" people behind. There is always someone greater than you who you should follow and trust in. You are there to follow and obey.
1.4.4.1. Pro: While at the local level, organized religious groups may be beneficial, any strata above that in the hierarchy is detrimental, either by virtue of violence against non-believers or being exclusionary of those not of that religion.
1.4.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.
1.4.6. Pro: People with good intentions end up threatening people with hell and/or promising them heaven.
1.4.7. Pro: It seems that the point of religion is to fundamentally control, otherwise people would be left to think or believe what they like.
1.4.8. Pro: Religion is another tool for people in power to wage war against other religious group
1.4.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.
1.4.9. Con: Religion as social control is a western-centric concept. Many Eastern religions do not impose social orders in tandem with supernatural belief systems.
1.4.9.1. Con: Many eastern religions certainly impose social orders, even if they differ from the ones that western religions impose. For examples, look at the strict caste system of Hinduism in India \([BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35650616)\) or the "Mandate of Heaven" that was used by dynasties in China to help maintain rule and justify coups.
1.4.9.1.1. Con: Much of the West has its own system of separating people. While not as explicitly as cast, class divides can still divide people for their [entire life](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/07/social-mobility-america/491240/), [prevent marriages](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/upshot/rise-in-marriages-of-equals-and-in-division-by-class.html), and trap people for [generations](https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/03/daily-chart-11).
1.4.9.1.1.1. Con: Class divides based on income are rooted in capitalism not secularism, and can affect secular and religious countries [equally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality).
1.4.9.1.1.2. Con: The [East](https://blogs.adb.org/blog/responding-income-inequality-asia), including [India](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rich-poor-divide-in-india-widening-as-economy-grows-report/story-5iyHD5PbJa4kqCw8qBrNsO.html), also has [divisions](https://apjjf.org/-Yoshio-Sugimoto/3419/article.html) among classes for [economic](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-study-finds-class-divide-in-singapore) reasons, aside from \(and often intertwined with\) religious-based divisions such as castes.
1.4.9.2. Pro: [Sikhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism#Justice_and_equality) advocates for a God without form or gender. Everyone is [equal](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/beliefs/beliefs.shtml) in front of God and has equal direct access to God. Sikhism also commands believers to use ordinary life to be closer to God, to strive for social justice and to live honestly.
1.4.9.2.1. Pro: The Sikh code of conduct does not deal with [abortion](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/sikhethics/abortion.shtml), or many other bioethical issues, and the practice is not uncommon among the Sikh community in India.
1.4.9.2.1.1. Con: Sikhism, from a theoretical perspective, still forbids [abortion](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/sikhethics/abortion.shtml) and considers it a sin.
1.4.9.2.2. Pro: Sikhism considers men and women as [equals](http://www.wahegurunet.com/role-of-women-in-sikhism). Even if [gender discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Sikhism) exists because it is roted in culture, in the Sikh society there is no religious basis for it.
1.4.9.2.2.1. Pro: In fact, in the 15th century, Sikhism was the first known major religion to advocate the equality of all people, especially [women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Sikhism).
1.4.9.2.3. Con: Although Sikhism has no specific teachings about [homosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism_and_sexual_orientation), in modern times there is a divide between those who condemn it and those who consider it an acceptable option within Sikhism.
1.4.9.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.3.
1.4.9.4. Pro: Buddhism, for example, does not provide strict and unanimous moral teachings on issues like [abortion](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml), [death penalty](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/capitalpunishment.shtml) or [euthanasia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/euthanasiasuicide.shtml).
1.4.9.4.1. Con: The fact that Buddhism views are not as unanimous and as hierarchical as other religions does not mean their teachings cannot be used as a form of control.
1.4.9.4.1.1. Pro: For example, traditional Buddhism reject [abortion](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml) and Buddhism is also against [contraceptive](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/contraception.shtml) methods used when the egg is fertilized. Although not explicitly, Buddha's teachings would be against the [death penalty](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/capitalpunishment.shtml) and regarding [euthanasia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/euthanasiasuicide.shtml) the most common position is that it is wrong.
1.4.9.4.2. Pro: Buddhism has never held views against [homosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_and_sexual_orientation) and Buddha's teachings do not condemn non-reproductive [sex](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/contraception.shtml).
1.4.9.5. Con: Religion does not need to be implemented as a social control to impede new and pragmatic ideas. It can function as a cultural tool for validation: based in belief rather than using an objective method.
1.4.10. Pro: Religion is one of the only things that actively invades and wants to control many aspects of one's private life which is something that law cannot do.
1.4.10.1. Con: There are definitely laws and political systems that invade and control many aspects of one's private life.
1.4.10.1.1. Con: Democratic governments have a mandate to control what citizens have decided governments must control.
1.4.10.1.1.1. Pro: Religion also receives the same mandate as democracy since people worship voluntarily.
1.4.10.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3.
1.4.10.1.1.2. Con: All laws and political systems are not democratic.
1.4.10.1.1.3. Con: Not all citizens might have had a say in what aspects of their lives the government has decided it must control.
1.4.10.1.1.3.1. Pro: In representative governments citizens do not vote on laws, they only vote on the people who make them.
1.4.10.2. Con: Religion can emancipate and liberate the human mind from other forms of social control.
1.4.10.2.1. Con: Replacing one form of social control with another is not liberation or emancipation.
1.4.10.2.2. Pro: Religion can help emancipate oneself from [capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13789119-economy-of-desire).
1.4.10.2.2.1. Con: That Christianity can [provide](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13789119-economy-of-desire) "resources for faithfully navigate the postmodern global economy" does not mean religion can make someone escape capitalism.
1.4.10.2.2.1.1. Pro: [Christianity](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Role_of_Christianity_in_civilization) played a role in the creation and adoption of [capitalism](https://acton.org/pub/religion-liberty/volume-10-number-3/how-christianity-created-capitalism).
1.4.10.2.3. Pro: Religion can reduce [death anxiety](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10851385-unclean).
1.4.10.2.3.1. Con: There are many who do not fear death. Nonexistence is nothing to fear and many have come to see this.
1.4.10.2.3.1.1. Con: There's a difference between having death anxiety and fear of death. Death anxiety is crippling malaise that has far-reaching consequences in how you live, perceive your life and treat others. Not fearing death at all, on the other hand, is a luxuourious delusion for people who have never felt the gut-wrenching totality of basic, creaturely will-to-live.
1.4.10.2.3.2. Pro: Religion comforts people from the inevitability of death.
1.4.10.2.3.2.1. Con: It might be healthier to get over the fear of death and nonexistence all together rather than convince someone it is not the end.
1.4.10.2.3.2.2. Pro: Strong faith can lead people to believe in an afterlife, offering them immeasurable comfort in their final days.
1.4.10.2.3.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.6.
1.4.10.2.3.2.3. Pro: Religion can bring comfort to the relatives of the recently deceased.
1.4.10.2.3.2.3.1. Con: This could be seen as preying on people when they are at their weakest.
1.4.10.2.3.2.4. Con: Religion is an institutionalization of the fear of death that we, humans, have as a consequence of our deeper intelligence.
1.4.10.2.3.2.4.1. Pro: In honor to that intelligence that allow us to perceive and fear death, and therefore create gods and praise them, we can also take another step forward, banishing the institution of religion from the empiric realm of the fear of death. We are grown enough as a species to accept we are scared of the end of our lives, and that religion is a social construct.
1.4.10.2.3.2.5. Pro: Religion can provide hope for a life beyond death.
1.4.10.2.3.2.6. Con: Knowing the inevitability of death is necessary to truly appreciate life and use the short time we have wisely.
1.4.10.2.3.2.7. Con: The belief in an afterlife has held people back as they believe they have an eternity to enjoy once they've got their Earth life over and done with, rather than enjoying it here and now
1.4.10.2.4. Pro: Each religion usually contains all steps needed to expose and surpass the limits of [mental slavery.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/7-ways-emancipate-yourself-from-mental-slavery-brigette-hyacinth)
1.4.10.2.4.1. Con: Religion is itself a form of mental slavery. Christians willfully submit themselves as slaves to their god. They are taught to both love and fear god. The same is true of both Jews and Muslims.
1.4.10.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3.
1.4.10.2.6. Con: Religious indoctrination at young ages can have harmful [consequences](https://www.salon.com/2014/11/01/the_sad_twisted_truth_about_conservative_christianitys_effect_on_the_mind_partner/).
1.4.10.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.7.1.1.
1.4.10.2.6.2. Pro: Religion may lead to societal rejection of a person, particularly of children born into the religion, if they do not fit into the religion's rules. \(such as being born gay or trans in a strictly hetero-normative religion\)
1.4.10.2.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3.
1.4.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.
1.4.10.4. Pro: The experience of faith is profoundly moving and personal. To hand any large organisation such a massive emotional lever is a bad idea.
1.4.10.4.1. Pro: It is absolute power that is bound to result in absolute corruption.
1.4.10.4.2. Pro: Many organised religions, no matter how they start, end up hierarchical and manipulative.
1.4.11. Con: Gender roles, greed, politics, personal power, good intentions, activism, etc. have all been used as a form of social control too.
1.4.11.1. Con: Religions use them as a form of social control as well. Everyone knows Christians are using every one of those examples, nearly all of which started not long after Chistianity took over Rome.
1.4.11.2. Con: That there are other sources of social control does not imply that religion is not a source of social control.
1.4.11.2.1. Con: That a sociocultural system is used as a means for social control does not imply that the system is itself the source.
1.4.11.2.1.1. Con: The rules within the religions and all the dogma and beliefs that must be adhered to are sources of social control and consequently the religion is therefore the source.
1.4.11.2.1.1.1. Con: Rules, dogma and doctrine can be and is frequently voluntarily chosen. Choosing to live a certain way with a community that believes certain things is not the same as being controlled.
1.4.11.2.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3.
1.5. Con: Most religions are patriarchal in nature and have promoted the subjugation of women.
1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.
1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.4.3.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.
1.5.4. Pro: Islam has supported gender inequality.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Islam supports a complementary vision of men and women with "a separation of social functions" in where "woman's sphere of operation is the home" and "a man's corresponding sphere is the outside world" which certainly [limits women's experiences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Islam#Gender_roles) and freedom.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Traditional interpretations of Islam require a woman to have her [husband's permission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Islam#Gender_roles) to leave the house and take up employment.
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: In Islam, men have authority over women and some religious interpretations of the Qur'an consider that allows [domestic violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_domestic_violence) against women.
1.5.4.1.3. Pro: Many Islamic religious leaders consider women unfit to [lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_as_imams#Mixed-gender_congregations) mixed-gender congregations.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Islamic law discriminates between men and women.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: In some Islamic countries, the testimony of women is given [less weightage](https://islamqa.info/en/1105) in a court of law as compared to a man's.
1.5.4.2.2. Pro: Muslim men [are allowed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygyny_in_Islam) to practice polygyny and can have up to a total of four wives at one time. Polyandry, the practice of a woman having more than one husband, however, is not permitted.
1.5.4.2.3. Con: Islam promotes egalitarianism, which is expressed by guaranteeing women certain rights such as the right to life, to education, to conduct business, maintain property, and to keep their names \([Galloway, p. 32](https://nsuworks.nova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=shss_dcar_etd)\).
1.5.4.2.3.1. Con: The guarantee of a small number of rights, which often fail to materialize for women in [islamic states](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-womens-rights-driving-ban-lifted-marriage-custody-bank-accounts-travel-medical-a7969551.html), do not mean that Islam is feminist as Islamic scripture entrenches and emboldens oppressive gender roles in other aspects of its scripture.
1.5.4.2.3.2. Con: The scriptural guarantees of rights to women in Islam are limited by their depiction of women only in the roles of wives, mothers and daughters. As a result, they often marginalize those who fall outside the traditional paradigms of women depicted within scriptural texts.

1.5.4.2.4. Pro: A man is [allowed to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfaith_marriage_in_Islam) marry a woman from among the People of the Book \(Jews and Christians\), but a woman can only marry a muslim.
1.5.4.2.5. Pro: Women are given a [lesser share](https://www.al-islam.org/faith-and-reason-ayatullah-mahdi-hadavi-tehrani/question-32-difference-inheritance-women-and-men) of inheritance as compared to men.
1.5.4.2.5.1. Con: This is a simplistic understanding of [Islamic law](http://www.dar-alifta.org/Foreign/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=4825&CategoryID=5). While a man does inherit twice what a women inherits, a man has a responsibility to provide for his female relations. This equals out the inheritance as the money a man inherits must be used in part to feed, shelter and clothe the women in his family, while all of the money the woman inherits she can keep without even the obligation to spend it on her own sustenance eg. food, clothing, medication.
1.5.4.2.5.1.1. Pro: A man has the complete [financial responsibility and duty](http://www.dar-alifta.org/Foreign/ViewFatwa.aspx?ID=8337) of running a household or a family. A woman has[no financial responsibility](http://womeninislam.ws/en/misconceptions_household-responsibilities.aspx) or obligation laid upon her by Shariah to provide for a household.
1.5.4.3. Pro: Under Islam recommended clothing is [more restrictive for women than men](http://www.abukhadeejah.com/understanding-the-muslim-dress-code-modesty-for-men-and-the-hijab-for-women-islam-4-5/).
1.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.3.
1.5.6. Pro: Christianity has supported gender inequality.
1.5.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.15.1.4.
1.5.6.2. Pro: Christianity portrays a male deity, Father God, Son God, but no Mother God \(the virgin is not god she is merely a sanctified human\).  There are twelve male apostles, not one woman. Women are portrayed as either weeping mothers \(virgin mary\) or prostitutes \(magdalene\). The same can be said for Islam or Judaism, where God is portrayed as male and women are not allowed in the religious hierarchy.
1.5.6.3. Pro: Throughout history, the Catholic Church favored laws that opposed [women's suffrage](https://classroom.synonym.com/the-catholic-church-womens-suffrage-12085123.html).
1.5.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.15.1.4.2.
1.5.6.5. Con: The Church in Medieval times regulated [marriages](https://www.publicmedievalist.com/got-rape-and-middle-ages/) and tried to establish that there was consent from both parties.
1.5.6.5.1. Con: The Church also established the notion of '[conjugal debt](https://books.google.es/books?id=itG09FGBMwMC&lpg=PP1&vq=marital+rape+in+middle+ages&dq=marital+rape+in+middle+ages&pg=PA249&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)' in which satisfying the sexual needs of the spouse was mandatory. While that was equally required for men and women, at a time when women were almost considered property and [discriminated](https://www.publicmedievalist.com/got-rape-and-middle-ages/) against, giving away body autonomy equated to allowing abuse and assault within marriages.
1.5.6.5.2. Con: One of the ways the church regulated marriage was [the phrase "and obey" in the marriage vow](https://www.chicagomarriage.com/does-the-bride-have-to-say-obey-in-her-wedding-vows/) for the woman.
1.5.6.6. Pro: The [bible](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+2&version=NIV) also [tells](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3&version=NIV) women to be submissive and subject to their husband. This patriarchal model is commonly considered to be harmful today.
1.5.6.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.2.
1.5.7. Con: The fact that most religions are patriarchal in nature doesnt mean that religion is, by definition, patriarchal.
1.5.8. Con: Not all religions are patriarchal.
1.5.8.1. Pro: Of the religions with the most followers in the world \(Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam\) only the last three \(judeo-christian\) religions are distinctively patriarchal, the other two are centered around a belief of balance and equality between 'opposing' forces, do not have male-dominated structures and do not have 'laws' that are sexist or discriminatory against females and can therefore be considered as non-patriarchal.
1.5.8.1.1. Con: While the patriarchal nature may certainly differ, [Buddhism](https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/posts/can-women-become-leaders-in-the-buddhist-tradition) teachings are not exempt of gender inequality and misogyny.
1.5.8.1.1.1. Pro: Bernard Faure, scholar of Asian religions, asserts that "like most clerical discourses, Buddhism is indeed [relentlessly misogynist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Buddhism#Women's_Spiritual_Attainment), but as far as misogynist discourses go, it is one of the most flexible and open to multiplicity and contradiction".
1.5.8.1.1.2. Pro: Traditional [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Buddhism#Women's_Spiritual_Attainment) presents the classical [dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna%E2%80%93whore_complex#In_popular_culture) of women only being seen as mothers or "lustful temptresses or as evil incarnate".
1.5.8.1.1.3. Pro: LGBT [individuals](https://qz.com/india/586192/theres-a-misogynist-aspect-of-buddhism-that-nobody-talks-about/) cannot traditionally be ordained as monks or nuns, reflecting very strict and discriminating gender norms.
1.5.8.1.1.4. Pro: In [monastic](https://qz.com/india/586192/theres-a-misogynist-aspect-of-buddhism-that-nobody-talks-about/) life, there are more [rules](https://www.thoughtco.com/buddhism-and-sexism-449757) for nuns \(bhikkunis\) than monks \(bhikkus\) "and while everyone has to control their desires, women have the additional burden of not 'arousing the desires of men'".
1.5.8.1.1.4.1. Pro: In traditional stories, [women](https://qz.com/india/586192/theres-a-misogynist-aspect-of-buddhism-that-nobody-talks-about/) are often depicted as just a source of temptation. And while monks are the embodiments of 'dhamma' \(the path of enlightenment\), lustful insatiable women are the embodiments of 'samsara' \(the cycle of death and rebirths\).
1.5.8.1.1.5. Pro: In some Buddhist narratives, [women](https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/posts/can-women-become-leaders-in-the-buddhist-tradition) cannot be leaders as they are unable to reach enlightenment, which is believed to be a limitation of their gender.
1.5.8.1.1.5.1. Pro: Women can only reach enlightenment f if they gain good karma and are [reborn](https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/posts/can-women-become-leaders-in-the-buddhist-tradition) as men.
1.5.8.1.1.5.2. Pro: Several major monastic lineages in Sri Lanka, areas of Southeast Asia, and Tibetan cultural areas deny female renunciants full [ordination](https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/posts/can-women-become-leaders-in-the-buddhist-tradition).
1.5.8.1.1.5.3. Con: It is not because 'some' people/streams claim a thing that it is inherently related to the believe system they are part of. Exceptions can be found on both sides but there is no consensus across buddhistic leaders so it cannot be viewed as proof for the entire ideology.
1.5.8.1.1.6. Con: [Recent research](https://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1923&context=jiws) suggest that indeed Buddhist practices are not exempt from certain societal features \(of which gender discrimination is an element\) but the underlying ideology of buddhism supercedes 'worldly' things such as gender-identification by their innate search for 'egolessness' and related concepts.
1.5.8.1.2. Pro: There are no male leaders who directly infer their authority from a deity in [Hinduism](https://www.quora.com/Who-is-the-current-spiritual-leader-of-Hinduism#) or in [Buddhism](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Dalai-Lama-like-the-Pope-of-Buddhism). The spiritual leaders are influential in their wide following but they are not considered as a figure of authority who can pass sentences, proclaims the 'truth' \(in the voice of a deity\) or is considered to be above-human. Islam, Christianity and Judaism do have only male authority figures who personify at least one of these elements.
1.5.8.1.2.1. Con: The fact that there are no male leaders who can set truths does not preclude Hinduism and Buddhism from promoting beliefs and practices that subjugate women and therefore contribute to a patriarchal system.
1.5.8.1.2.1.1. Pro: Although there is variance, there are many discriminatory and patriarchal teachings in [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Hinduism) that limit women to be obedient daughters, housewives and mothers.
1.5.8.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The source explains there's 'also a strong Hindu tradition of questioning authority in order to deepen the understanding of these truths'. Meaning that although some scholars might interpret texts in a sexist way, the ideology itself doesn't have one \(male\) authority who can overrule everybody. The non-existence of a 'universal' truth in Hinduism is in fact supporting the claim that it is non-patriarchal \(compared to judeo-christian religions where this truth is claimed to be 'self-evident'\).
1.5.8.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The fact that Hinduism does not have one male authority able to sanction absolute truth, in the same way that Judeo-Christian traditions do, does not mean several practices within Hinduism are not [patriarchal](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/01/08/with-children-when-does-religion-go-too-far/in-hinduism-respect-the-sacred-ignore-the-sexism) since they place men at the top and women at the bottom.
1.5.8.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many forms of [marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Hinduism#Practices) in Hinduism include the father giving away his daughter without consent, therefore positioning women as the property of their fathers or husbands, which is certainly [patriarchal](http://damienmarieathope.com/2017/05/sexism-prejudice-and-killing-in-vedic-culture-hinduism/).
1.5.8.1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Widowed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Hinduism#Practices) women are expected to pursue a spiritual life, in some cases being denied the possibility to remarry.
1.5.8.1.2.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: While [Sati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Hinduism#Practices) is today an obsolete practice, traditionally, women would immolate themselves at their husband pyre or commit suicide. The opposite was not a established practice.
1.5.8.1.2.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Women killing themselves when their husbands die certainly makes their [worth](http://www.mahavidya.ca/2008/06/21/sati-and-social-implications/) related to their husbands and not themselves as human beings.
1.5.8.1.2.1.1.1.1.3.2. Con: This does not specifically mean the religion is patriarchal as it can also be viewed as women having absolute power over life and death \(as carriers of life they also have the power to create death\). In Asian cultures this duality often leads to respect and reverence to females. It does however have very little to do with the 'worldly' practices of institutionalised \(patriarchal\) religion.
1.5.8.1.2.1.1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Sati is or was not about women having the power to control their lives, by that logic, suicide should be an option at any point. Women killed themselves only when their husbands died, which showed how their worth was completely tied to their husbands. Men did not commit suicide when their wives died.
1.5.8.1.2.1.1.1.1.4. Con: Practices cannot be 'patriarchal' as patriarchy refers to an institution/structure based on power and authority. Practices can be discriminatory but discrimination does not imply patriarchal structures in itself.
1.5.8.1.2.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: [Patriarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy) refers to “a social system in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property”. For that system to exist, social practices, even without a top-down formal authority, need to be indeed discriminatory towards women.
1.5.8.1.2.1.1.1.1.4.2. Con: When wide discrimination towards women exist, and therefore there is a hierarchy between men and women, even if is not explicitly defined, that indeed in practice constitutes a patriarchal system.
1.5.8.1.2.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: [Gender equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_inequality_in_India) in traditionally and present-day Hinduism [countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_inequality_in_Nepal) are among the [worst](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/slideshows/the-10-worst-countries-for-gender-equality-ranked-by-perception?slide=8) of the [world](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/mapped-the-best-and-worst-countries-for-gender-equality/). When religion and culture are as intertwined as it is the case, the responsibility of religion in a patriarchal society cannot be denied.
1.5.8.1.2.1.2. Pro: Similar to judeo-christian traditions, Buddha's teachings also advise wives that to be "[obedient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Buddhism#Women's_Spiritual_Attainment) to their husbands, please them, and not make them angry through their own desires".
1.5.8.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Buddha's teachings are only a small part of the entire religous body of knowledge and have been contested on several occassions, making it a disputed source that cannot be seen as the universal truth of the buddhist religion.
1.5.8.1.3. Pro: Contrary to judeo-christian traditions, there are [examples](https://www.thoughtco.com/buddhism-and-sexism-449757) of buddhist 'nuns' across Asia \(and more recently other parts of the world\) who are regarded in higher status than male monks or institutions where males and females are studying together. This can indicate that there is no inherent 'truth' of males being superior to females \(which is much more prominent in judeo-christian religions\).
1.5.8.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.8.1.1.3.
1.5.8.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.5.8.1.1.4.
1.5.8.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.5.8.1.1.5.
1.5.8.1.4. Con: -> See 1.5.8.1.2.1.1.
1.5.8.1.5. Con: -> See 1.5.8.1.2.1.2.
1.5.8.2. Pro: According to estimates there are '4300' different religions in the world, so far not a lot of research has been done on how many of them are in essence patriarchal. But the overall image is far to complex to simply state that 'most of [them](http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/religion101/2012/10/how-many-religions-are-there-part-five-the-hard-numbers.html)' are patriarchal.
1.5.8.2.1. Con: While it is true there are likely too many religions to determine what percentage is patriarchal [the majority of the human population is either Christian or Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations) and thus most religious people fall into the category of belonging to a patriarchal religion.
1.5.8.3. Con: [Over half](https://www.kialo.com/has-religion-been-a-good-thing-for-humanity-8539/8539.0=8539.1-8539.2642+8539.4507) the worlds' population follow a patriarchal [religion](https://michaelsherlockauthor.wordpress.com/2017/01/25/religion-a-patriarchal-prison/).
1.5.9. Con: At the time when Christianity was first formally establishing its own doctrine. It was seen as one of the most egalitarian religions at the time because it elevated the status of women to be equal in the eyes of God.
1.5.9.1. Pro: Nowhere does Christ mention subordination having any place in relationships between his followers, even discrediting such hierarchal structures and instead encourages servicing each other, including to the point of death[\[Mt 20:25–26a\]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+20%3A25-28&version=NIV) [\[Mk 10:42-43\]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A42-45&version=NIV)[\[Lk 22:25\]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+22%3A25&version=NIV).
1.5.9.2. Pro: According to historian Geoffrey Blainey, many of those who held positions of authority within Palestine were disapproving of how well Jesus treated the women during his life \(Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity\).
1.5.9.3. Con: -> See 1.5.6.
1.5.10. Pro: -> See 1.5.8.3.
1.5.11. Pro: In postindustrial societies, scholars suggest a connection between modernization and [secularization](https://michaelsherlockauthor.wordpress.com/2017/01/25/religion-a-patriarchal-prison/) and gender equality. When religious values are weakened, gender equality increases.
1.6. Con: People have been led to do terrible things in the name of religion.
1.6.1. Con: Terrible things must sometimes be done to put an end to terrible things.
1.6.1.1. Con: However, when we tread such grey areas we need to be rational and objective or we risk letting biases, such as religious bias, lead us astray.
1.6.1.2. Con: Many religious atrocities were not in response to other terrible things but rather were either unprompted or simply done to harm those with different beliefs.
1.6.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13.
1.6.1.2.2. Pro: The [Crusades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades), religious wars sanctioned by the Latin Church in the medieval period, were [brutal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_and_anthropogenic_disasters_by_death_toll).
1.6.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.
1.6.1.3. Con: Religions have arbitrarily defined which things are terrible.
1.6.1.3.1. Pro: Religions are unaccountable. We can't vote them out or persuade them of the error of their ways because their ways are decided at the top by those who've shown themselves loyal. We can't overthrow them like we can a dictator because persecution would just make the remainder more fervent.
1.6.1.4. Con: And the religion will always forgive the former, but never the latter.
1.6.2. Con: The worst outcomes of religion are often due to the fallibility of its adherents to understand and apply the tenets of the faith rather than the accurate expression of the tenet as intended.
1.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.
1.6.2.2. Con: It's not necessary to look as far as the tenets. Christians believe in their god, that he's their spiritual leader, as the bible says, but the bible describes him as a [mass murderer](http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.co.uk/2006/08/gods-death-toll-in-bible-book-of.html). It should be no surprise that some of them emulate him.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: [God killed everyone](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+19&version=NIV) in the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and then also killed Lot's wife for turning around.
1.6.2.2.2. Pro: [God killed all the firstborn](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+12&version=NIV) children in Egypt during the 10 plagues.
1.6.2.2.2.1. Con: Pharaoh and the Egyptians were [killing all the male children](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+1&version=NIV) of the Israelites. God did this to protect the Israelites from this oppression, and gave Pharaoh the [option to stop this from happening](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+11&version=NIV).
1.6.2.2.2.1.1. Con: An all powerful god could have taken other measures or even stopped the killing of the male children in the first place and resolved the issue bloodlessly. An all benevolent god certainly should be more merciful. Especially since many of those first born themselves did nothing wrong.
1.6.2.2.2.1.2. Con: Gambling the lives of thousands on a test for one seems, on its own, immoral, but as part of a pattern of hypocrisy and inhumanity it also seems amoral.
1.6.2.2.2.1.3. Pro: If God took people's ability to do wrong away and we were cognizant of this we would call him a horrible oppressive figure that takes people's freedom away, and we'd instead be arguing why a good God would be so oppressive.

If a parent was so controlling of they're child's behavior that they were incapable of ever doing anything wrong we'd at best call them a helicopter parent and at worst call them horribly abusive.
1.6.2.2.2.1.3.1. Con: Murdering people for no other reason than them being first born in their family is oppressive. Also an omnipotent god need not control peoples minds to free the Jews. If he can make food that tastes like whatever you want fall from the sky he can teleport the Jews out of Egypt without murdering any children.
1.6.2.2.2.1.3.2. Con: It is commonly argued by the religious that God is incapable of committing sin or being sinful. If God cannot be sinful, and still has free will, then the ability to do wrong is not necessary for free will and it would not be taking away freedom.
1.6.2.2.3. Pro: [God drowned all the Egyptians](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+14&version=NIV) chasing after the Jews in the Book of Exodus.
1.6.2.2.3.1. Con: Bad example, God had a reason for that, being to save his followers.
1.6.2.2.3.1.1. Con: [An omnipotent god](https://dailyverses.net/almighty) like the one the Jews in the story believed in could have simply teleported the Jews away without murdering anyone.
1.6.2.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Or teleported the army to safety.
1.6.2.2.4. Pro: [God orders the Israelites to exterminate](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+7&version=NIV) all the existing tribes and peoples living in Israel.
1.6.2.2.4.1. Con: The Torah had orders to clear the promised land of Canaanites. And other wars and laws for Israel when it was an autonomous nation. After they returned from captivity, they had to abide by the laws of the ruling power. They still had the instruction to 'love your fellow as yourself.'--[Leviticus 19:18](http://ctrchurch-mhk.org/ctrupdate/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Leviticus19_16-19LoveNeighborB.htm).
1.6.2.2.4.2. Con: Most scholars conclude that the biblical accounts of [extermination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herem_\(war_or_property\)) are exaggerated, fictional, or metaphorical.For instances, the Book of Joshua describes the extermination of the Canaanites, yet Joshua and Judges both suggest that the extermination [was not complete](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2494730/jewish/Torah-and-Genocide-FAQ.htm).
1.6.2.2.4.2.1. Con: [Modern historians think that the entire exodus story is entirely fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus#Historicity) but that is irrelevant to the fact that it is part of the cannon. Devout Jews truly believe that they were in Egypt and returned to Canaan where they were commanded by their god to massacre the existing populations of non-Jews.
1.6.2.2.4.3. Con: Although the biblical narrative commands the extermination of the of Canaanites, "mainstream Jewish traditions throughout history have treated these texts as [purely historical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_and_warfare) or highly conditioned, and in either case not relevant to contemporary life".
1.6.2.2.4.3.1. Con: Despite that mainstream view, "some minor strains of [radical Zionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_and_warfare)" have promoted "aggressive war" and they have justified it with biblical texts.
1.6.2.2.4.4. Pro: [God commanded the Jews to slaughter the Amalekites.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+17&version=NIV)
1.6.2.2.5. Pro: God ordered the [murder](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+32&version=NIV) of 3,000 Jews for worshiping the golden calf.
1.6.2.2.5.1. Con: Moses says that God says this. God does not actually command this. As we see elsewhere in Exodus, the author has no problem with having God say something and then having Moses repeat that thing. Therefore, it's just as probable that Moses put words in God's mouth.
1.6.2.2.5.1.1. Con: In the narrative Moses is a mouth piece for god and is generally regarded as trustworthy there is no reason to think that he made up this command himself.
1.6.2.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Moses has a [problem with using violence](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+2&version=NIV) as we see elsewhere in his story, and it's perfectly in fitting with his character to make this thing happen.
1.6.2.2.6. Pro: God [killed](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+14&version=NIV) the Jewish scouts sent to Israel by the Jews from the dessert with a plague. God had wanted to kill them and all their children but Moses convinced him to have reason and spare some.
1.6.2.2.7. Pro: God [killed](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+16&version=NIV) 250 Levite princes who wanted to usurp Moses \(God wanted to kill the entire congregation but Moses calmed Them down\). Then afterwards, when there was unrest due to their murder, God killed 14,700 Jews with a plague.
1.6.2.2.8. Pro: God commands the [murder](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+25&version=NIV) of 24,000 Israelites who lay with moabite women.
1.6.2.2.8.1. Con: The [Moabite women](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+25&version=NET) cause the men who lay with them to worship idols. [We see](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jeremiah+7&version=NIV) [elsewhere in the text](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+57&version=NIV) that [worship of these idols leads to the sacrifice of children](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+21&version=NIV). God may be [protecting children](http://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-21.htm).
1.6.2.2.9. Con: God generally only uses judgement in the mass murderer sense when doing so protects the weak. For example, God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah. Their sin was not sodomy, but taking advantage of those weaker than themselves, and refusing to help [the poor and needy](http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-49.htm).
1.6.2.2.9.1. Con: In the [biblical flood of Noah](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+7&version=NIV) god personally wiped out everything on the planet that was not on the arc or could live underwater.
1.6.2.2.9.1.1. Con: Many of the stories in the Bible \(such as the flood\) are re-tellings of older stories. The content of the story may \(or may not be\) less important than how the story is different from the story it re-tells.
1.6.2.2.9.1.1.1. Pro: The story of [Utnapishtim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh_flood_myth#Flood_myth_section) and the story of [Noah](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6&version=NIV) are re-tellings of the same story. Showing how YHWH is completely unlike the other gods.
1.6.2.2.9.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the story of [Utnapishtim](http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/gilgamesh/tab11.htm) the hearts of the gods move them to cause the flood, in the story of [Noah](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6&version=NIV), the violence of men moves God to cause the flood.

The difference between these two stories being that it is the violence of the gods that leads them to cause the flood and it's God's desire to end violence that leads him to cause the flood.
1.6.2.2.9.1.1.1.2. Pro: In the story of [Noah](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6&version=NIV), God loves Noah and so saves him. In the story of [Utnapishtim](http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/gilgamesh/tab11.htm), the gods conspire to destroy men, but Ea rebels against the other gods as he often does.

The difference between these two stories is that in the story of Noah, the functioning of the universe \(God\) is of unified purpose to help Noah, while in the story of Utnapishtim the functioning of the universe \(gods\) is in chaos, and it is only by the work of trickery that Utnapishtim survives.
1.6.2.2.9.1.1.1.3. Pro: In the story of [Utnapishtim](http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/gilgamesh/tab11.htm), Ea tells him to lie to the others who will not survive the flood while [God makes no such command to Noah](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6&version=NIV).

Jewish Rabbis have argued that God actually [wanted Noah to argue on behalf of these other people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah#Judaism).
1.6.2.2.9.1.1.1.4. Pro: The god of the earth Enlil is the instigator of the flood, who is angry when he learns that Ea has worked against him, suggesting that the earth has rejected man. When Noah is born it is prophesied that he will [comfort men regarding the curse](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+5&version=NIV) God has laid on the ground, and after the flood God states that [no longer will he curse the ground](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+8&version=NIV). Suggesting that the earth has accepted man in the story of Noah.
1.6.2.2.9.1.1.1.5. Pro: [Utnapishtim](http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/gilgamesh/tab11.htm)'s effort in building the boat is painstakingly detailed. Noah's effort is outlined in a single [sentence](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6%3A22&version=NIV).

The difference is that Utnapishtim survives by his hard work and the love of Ea while Noah survives by the love of God while a point is made elsewhere that Noah will give men rest from their work. Utnapishtim's work is valued while Noah's rest is valued.
1.6.2.2.9.1.1.1.6. Pro: In the story of Utnapishtim the gods end the flood because they are unhappy with what they have done while God ends the flood because he remembers Noah.

One story hinges on regret while the other story hinges on [remembering one's promises](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+8&version=NIV).
1.6.2.2.9.1.1.1.7. Pro: The story of [Utnapishtim](http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/gilgamesh/tab11.htm) ends with Utnapishtim being blessed and made godlike. The story of Noah sort of ends with God blessing all life and putting his [bow in the clouds](http://inters.org/biblical-symbolism-rainbow) signifying that he will not use it to attack the Earth again.
1.6.2.2.9.1.1.2. Pro: The [story of Moses](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+2&version=NLT) is a re-telling of the story of [Sargon of Akkad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#Birth_legend). Moses lead his people out of Egypt using God's strength while Sargon established his kingdom in combat.
1.6.2.2.10. Con: God's mercy vastly outweighs his judgement [Exodus 34:6-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34&version=NIV).
1.6.2.2.11. Con: In the book of [Jonah](https://www.gotquestions.org/Jonah-angry.html), God expresses frustration with Jonah because Jonah wants the people of Nineveh to be destroyed.
1.6.2.2.12. Con: Moses has problems with being patient with Israel. It is his tendency to want to lead the people with a [stick rather than with his voice](https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/537634/jewish/Why-Did-Moses-Hit-the-Rock.htm), and God is trying to create from Moses a leader who will use his voice rather than a stick. Because when Israel is lead by someone who [uses a stick to oppress his people](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+12&version=NIV) eventually "[blood is spread from one side of Jerusalem to the other](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+21&version=NIV)". God wrestles with Moses during the exile by providing Moses opportunities to take [Moses's tactics](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+2&version=NIV) to [their conclusion](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+32&version=NIV).
1.6.2.2.13. Con: God repeatedly makes Moses convince God that God should not destroy the people to demonstrate that the role of God's People is to intercede on behalf of others rather than condemn them. We see this perfected by Jesus at the start of [John 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8&version=NKJV).
1.6.2.2.14. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.2.9.1.
1.6.2.2.15. Pro: The bible overwhelmingly portrays a being as inhuman as its powers would suggest. If it faked all the evidence of evolution and we were actually made in its image then we're the improved model.
1.6.2.2.16. Con: Christianity teaches that God is sovereign, that he has the right to destroy those who harm others, that, because he can see what's in people's hearts, his justice is perfect. Human justice is often injustice.
1.6.2.2.16.1. Con: Since it is humans  administering God's justice, even if God exists, that justice can equally be unjust and exploited for personal gain.
1.6.2.2.16.1.1. Pro: In Christianity, God's actions are mediated and carried out by humans, and thus, regardless of the existence of God, prone to injustice.
1.6.2.2.16.2. Con: Laws in democratic countries are agreed by all citizens. Religious laws are implemented and administered by some humans interpreting the words of God, which may be true or may not be, and may be well interpreted or not.
1.6.2.2.16.2.1. Con: Laws in a direct democracy are agreed on by the majority. In a representative democracy the laws may be agreed upon by only a rich and vocal minority.
1.6.2.2.16.2.1.1. Con: Laws in a direct democracy are agreed on by the majority of those who vote \(not a straight majority\), and the vast majority of them either have or are prepared to allocate little time to analyzing the issues and/or don't have the skill set to effectively do so. Thus it is the direct democracy rather than representative democracy that is more vulnerable to a rich or vocal minority, the issues at least being in the wheel house of elected representatives.
1.6.2.2.16.3. Con: If God exists, we can't conclude that everything he does is automatically morally right.
1.6.2.2.16.3.1. Pro: In [Genesis 19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+19&version=NIV), God massacred two cities for having a different lifestyle, but let live a father because he offered to let men rape his daughters. [This](https://www.kialo.com/has-religion-been-a-good-thing-for-humanity-8539/8539.0=8539.1-8539.5-8539.1021-8539.1052) is not someone we should be getting morals from.
1.6.2.3. Con: Religion is a personal interpretation. Many passages of religious works can be interpreted, or translated in different ways to mean different things, pushing personal agendas into groups. Example: Views on LGBT, though the term "homosexual" was never used in a bible till the 1940's, but is currently accepted as Biblical Law from original writings.
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.2.2.
1.6.4. Con: Historically religion has been used as a scapegoat for the those who have pursued political power and money. Gathering the forces they required by demonizing their enemies whilst canonizing themselves.
1.6.4.1. Con: All religions instill prejudice in followers.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.
1.6.4.1.2. Pro: While it may have fostered unity amongst like believers, religion has historically caused more division, conflict and violence amongst groups than it has ever unified them.
1.6.4.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.
1.6.4.1.2.2. Pro: Religion is based on human power and due to religion human beings have been divided in so many groups such as Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian, Isai etc. If all these divisions were scraped, humanity would be better.
1.6.4.1.2.3. Pro: Religion promotes racism/discrimination, as believers think that people from other religions are wrong and, in most religions, that they are sinners.
1.6.4.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.6.1.
1.6.4.1.2.5. Pro: Religious people tend to believe they have a purpose in life, they do the right thing, behave in the correct way and have ethical superiority which creates division, criticism and hate.
1.6.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.6.1.
1.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.10.2.1.
1.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.
1.6.7. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.
1.6.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.10.2.3.
1.6.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.
1.6.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13.
1.6.11. Con: Religion is nothing more than a human organization, and as such has darkness in it too. Bad actions are always the loudest, the ones we all know about, but there are a lot of good things made in the name of religion that silently surround us.
1.6.11.1. Con: One would think that religion, with its purpose to improve the morality of its followers, would have much smaller problems with immoral behavior. In fact, the opposite seems the case.
1.6.12. Con: -> See 1.1.9.
1.6.13. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.
1.6.14. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.
1.6.15. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.
1.6.16. Pro: Numerous recent terrorist attacks have been made in the name of Islam. To name a few, [9/11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks), , [2004 Madrid attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Madrid_train_bombings), [2015 in Paris in January](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo_shooting) and in [November](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks), and [so many in Arab world towards minorities , including other muslims.](https://stepfeed.com/these-are-the-arab-countries-suffering-from-the-most-terror-attacks-1918)
1.6.16.1. Con: Disregarding the [external](http://www.aei.org/feature/timeline-us-involvement-with-iraq-and-the-broader-middle-east/) [meddling](https://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/2014/08/tragic-cycle-western-powers-and-middle-east) and [internal affairs](https://www.csis.org/analysis/stability-middle-east-range-short-and-long-term-causes) of the [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_foreign_policy_in_the_Middle_East)and the geopolitical situation in the region in the past several decades makes it really easy to paint Islam as bad and the root of the problems.
1.6.17. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.8.
1.6.18. Con: Religion should not be blamed for its misuse.
1.6.18.1. Pro: Misunderstanding arise when people do not know what are true values of religions are. Some third parties targeting their personal gain misguide people into believing into something what religion is not. There has to be some concrete credible and authentic source of information to base your beliefs around. You should take sentences in context, not out of context. Religion is not a word but how you live. You better be critical about how you live and know where everything is headed.
1.6.18.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.6.18.3. Pro: Many conflicts are a misrepresentation of the religion being claimed. The adherent either uses religion as a scapegoat or is misunderstanding the message they have been taught.
1.6.18.4. Con: Each religion is a system created by people, maintained by people and operated, including supposed misuse, for those people. And in some religions every misuse can be forgiven, which encourages more misuse.
1.6.18.5. Con: Misuse is a subjective term. If someone, with the knowing assistance of the local preacher, inculcates their infant daughter in scripture as major religions precisely instruct \([e.g.](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/study-bible/books/deuteronomy/6/#v5006006-v5006007)\), then that could be called brainwashing, child abuse, and misuse of power, for which the religion should be blamed. But the parent's and preacher's lean on their belief to rationalize inflicting the fear of God upon the impressionable girl to ensure her supposed place-in-heaven-and-security-from-hell.
1.6.18.6. Pro: No religion motivates people to do terrible things. People do terrible things to satisfy their ego.
1.6.18.6.1. Con: -> See 1.6.4.1.2.3.
1.6.18.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.8.1.
1.6.18.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.
1.6.18.7. Pro: For example, adding the idea from [Plato](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2009801), philosophers brought in the idea of eternal torment from neoplatonic thought. Which caused deleterious effects later: the nastiness in the Crusades. The monk Arnold Amalric was the first to say "Slay them all, God will recognize His own" during the Albigensian crusade.
1.6.18.8. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13.1.2.
1.6.19. Con: People do terrible things and they name religion as the reason. This is different from the religion making them do it.
1.6.19.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.
1.6.19.2. Pro: People do terrible things in name of many reasons, even those wich are seen as good for sure for ex. science, general well being.
1.6.20. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.5.1.5.1.2.
1.6.21. Con: People have been led to do great things in the name of religion.
1.6.21.1. Pro: The [Hagia Sophia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia), commonly considered to be a World Wonder, was constructed as a result of religion.
1.6.21.1.1. Con: It may be pretty but it's still just a building with a positive function only if religion is considered a good thing. It was built using taxes gathered for Emperor [Justinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I). The effort put into it could have been put towards infrastructure which would have had positive practical results.
1.6.21.2. Pro: It is theorized that the Stonehenge, commonly considered to be a World Wonder, was constructed as a result of religion.
1.6.21.3. Pro: Religion has provided charity and welfare in the past and in modern times.
1.6.21.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.2.2.
1.6.21.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.2.
1.6.21.3.3. Pro: Organised religion created successful and well-known platforms for humanitarian aid, such as the [Order of Malta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta#Today).
1.6.21.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.5.
1.7. Con: Humankind has wasted too much time, effort and resources on religion, with few to no practical results.
1.7.1. Pro: A building where people go and listen to someone proselytise is a waste of materials, effort and the time, particularly in countries where the climate is conducive to being outdoors.
1.7.2. Con: Formally and informally throughout the world and history, social institutions \(schools, hospitals, orphanages, etc.\) have been started primarily and often exclusively by religious adherents and organizations long before government filled such a role. Even with state socialization of such needs non-secular actions and efforts play a prominent role to meet whatever needs may remain.
1.7.3. Pro: A religious text is made up of moral tales, truisms, “facts” and tenets. The moral tales are to establish that it's "good" and the truisms to establish that it's “true”. Both are to make credible the “facts”: carrot \(heaven\) and stick \(hell\), which ensure obedience to the tenets. It’s at best a waste of your time, at worst a lifelong search for meaning where there is nothing to find but a confidence trick.
1.7.3.1. Con: The basis for religious truth is not based on facts, it is based on narrative and morality and lays down a guideline for human existence.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: Rules, "a guideline", a distinction without a difference given the "facts" of heaven and hell.
1.7.3.1.2. Con: "is based on narrative and morality" Translation: "uses narrative and common morals to establish credibility".
1.7.3.1.3. Con: 'Religious truth' is only a 'truth' in the sense that it is believed, thus "The basis for religious truth" translates to "How we persuade you".
1.7.3.2. Con: Moral values may be based in anecdote or even fact, but that is the means of transmission, not intended as a logical premise and therefore not the measurement of its validity.
1.7.4. Con: Religion keeps people in closed thinking circles. It prevents people from creativity and innovation. Real progress for mankind needs open minds not believers of traditional wisdom.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Religion tends to suppress free and critical thinking.
1.7.4.1.1. Pro: Religion demands unquestioning belief in unsubstantiated claims that are lacking in evidence, and frequently in the face of contradictory evidence. This is antithetical to critical thinking.
1.7.4.1.1.1. Pro: Religion discourages critical thinking because of its dogmatic nature so no error can be exposed or debated.
1.7.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: In religion you can never debate the existence of gods.
1.7.4.1.2. Con: Religion \(especially the Catholic one\) assumes and requires a truly free acceptance, so critical and free thinking is encouraged from the very start. There is not even a moment when one is asked to abandon reason, logic, science, etc.
1.7.4.1.2.1. Con: [Miracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharistic_miracle) and the belief in miracles are a [fundamental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonization#Catholic_Church) principle of Catholicism. To not believe in [miracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infallibility_of_the_Church) would be un Catholic. Miracles by definition exist in opposition to scientific sceptical reasoning.
1.7.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Belief that miracles exist in no way rejects the validity of reason and science. It is merely an understanding that not all things in human experience fall within the grasp of empirical tools.
1.7.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Belief in miracles is belief without evidence, belief without reason. To believe in such a way is to toss reason out the window and surrender to blind faith.
1.7.4.1.2.1.1.2. Con: If belief in miracles in no way rejects science,then the miracle must be subject to natural laws of the world. At this point it is no longer a miracle. A caterpillar turns into a butterfly, this could be said to be miraculous, yet It is explainable, or believed to be one day explained. For this metamorphism to be a true miracle, it must necessarily be outside of a scientific understanding of the world.
1.7.4.1.2.1.1.3. Con: A person of faith may believe in miracles alongside science but the miracle itself will be beyond reason. And the laws of physics are considered to be the same throughout the universe, or else they are no longer laws. A single exception would mean we must start again. Nothing can travel past the speed of light. If we accept a miracle that subverts this law, then the law would no longer exist. Faith may be compatible with science, but science cannot be bent in this way.
1.7.4.1.2.1.1.4. Pro: Faith has a positive position for the unknown. The unknown is accepted as part of the world and can exist alongside the scientific and rational. Whereas science treats the void as a negative, the thing outside of knowledge.
1.7.4.1.2.1.1.4.1. Con: No, science treats the unknown as a target for investigation. That's a positive thing, that we, as a race, are always learning. The extent of each religion's learning is how people can value themselves against the religion's values and tenets – It doesn't grow or progress in any significant manner over each generation. Scientific discovery and invention remains for us all long after the scientists are dead.
1.7.4.1.2.2. Con: The glory of a good confidence trick is that it's not about illogic, it's about misdirection and misinformation.
1.7.4.1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.
1.7.4.1.2.2.2. Pro: The mark uses the information presented to them and makes what appears to be a rational decision. It may even seem to be their own idea, but the information isn't what it appears to be or it isn't the whole picture.
1.7.4.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: A religious con most commonly goes like this: It starts off with a concept similar to conservation of energy, that we can't be destroyed. Once you've accepted that there may be heaven and/or hell then the con has created the carrot and/or stick and, while mileage may vary, your support is inevitable, whether it's money in the collection box, placard holding, or your vote.
1.7.4.1.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.
1.7.4.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3.3.
1.7.4.1.3. Con: Some [religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarian_Universalism), like Sikhism or [Budhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_\(Buddhism\)), do not demand blind belief, and many allow for a vast continuum of interpretations. They embrace the individual's path to truth and make it clear that dogma does not supersede personal conscience and experience.
1.7.4.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.4.
1.7.4.1.3.2. Pro: [Sikhism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/sikhethics/euthanasia.shtml) believes that [life](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/beliefs/beliefs.shtml) is a gift from God, but it also teaches that humans have a duty to use it in a responsible way, according to what they think it's right.
1.7.4.1.4. Pro: Religion is based on myth and God cannot be demonstrated and is undetectable. The embrace of superstition is [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink) which may lead to irrational or dysfunctional decision-making.
1.7.4.1.4.1. Con: Lack of evidence does not equal falsehood.
1.7.4.1.4.1.1. Con: Lack of evidence equals lack of reason to believe something. It is impossible to prove that there is not an invisible intangible giant unicorn on Saturn's rings yet it would be absurd to hold a belief that it exists.
1.7.4.1.5. Pro: Faith is a closed-ended inquiry. No learning is possible if you already decided the answer beforehand.
1.7.4.1.6. Pro: Religions are highly oriented to a confession advantage in a way of creating a self-protecting irrational highly-speculative believe system. Probably not a single logical fallacy exist, that is not employed in a typical pro-religion discourse.
1.7.4.1.6.1. Pro: As result of suppression of critical thinking, religions significantly reduce self-consciousness of their members, and readily take a form of highly corrupted organizations.
1.7.4.1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.
1.7.4.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.1.7.
1.7.4.1.8. Pro: Religion destroys the ability of logical thinking, because it is itself based on an incorrect assumption \(about its infallibility\), and this causes that such an assumption is later incorrectly applied also in other areas of life
1.7.4.1.9. Pro: In some ways, religion has discouraged critical thought. For example, in the face of mountains of evidence, a scientific theory, evolution by natural selection, is often discounted by some religious people because it contradicts with a [creationist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation%E2%80%93evolution_controversy) worldview.
1.7.4.1.9.1. Pro: Though fewer fundamentalists exist today, they are still there, and they are not helping toward the progress of humanity.
1.7.4.1.9.2. Pro: Religion's value declines with each passing year and with each advance in our knowledge of the physical world.
1.7.4.1.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.2.1.1.
1.7.4.1.9.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.
1.7.4.1.10. Pro: Religion promotes non-logical / non-deductive thinking, especially considering the ages that people are first exposed to religion.
1.7.4.1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.3.3.4.3.3.
1.7.4.1.11. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.
1.7.4.1.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13.
1.7.4.1.13. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.
1.7.4.2. Con: Religion encourages philosophical and ethical debate. It is a human fault to result to confirmation bias.
1.7.5. Pro: Time spent praying is a waste, because the person praying may be talking to someone who either doesn't exist, isn't listening, can't help, won't help, or doesn't care.
1.7.5.1. Con: It might help you get a good night's sleep.
1.7.5.2. Con: No one really knows, for some people praying helps. Let's not say that people praying are not trying to do something with themselves.
1.7.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.1.
1.7.5.2.2. Con: If you pray and it dosen't help, it's because praying probably doesn't help.
1.7.5.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.1.
1.7.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.2.
1.7.5.3. Con: Even if there is not a superior force \(or God\), prayer and meditation can have beneficial outcomes.
1.7.5.3.1. Pro: When people pray, they are talking to their own subconscious and that may be helpful in the long run.
1.7.5.3.1.1. Con: If one is praying to cure their cancer that is beyond the ability of one's subconscious or conscious self and such it is not their own fault if it fails.
1.7.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.1.
1.7.5.3.1.2. Con: We can barely control any of the operation of our mind. The sub-conscious is by definition [out of our control](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-we-control-our-thoughts/).
1.7.5.3.1.2.1. Con: Memories influence thoughts and people think about things they have seen or felt or heard. Therefore, they can remember something they said during prayer and actively work towards it.
1.7.5.3.1.2.1.1. Con: That doesn't involve your subconscious.
1.7.5.3.1.2.1.2. Con: That is influencing your thoughts, however, that would be a conscious and deliberate influence meaning you would not be talking to your subconscious but rather simply setting goals for yourself.
1.7.5.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.2.
1.7.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.1.
1.7.5.3.3. Con: If there is no god to be talked to then positive affects of prayer can be done in a completely secular way.
1.7.5.3.3.1. Con: This is true. But, praying has been and is very effective for willfully directing one's positive intent.
1.7.5.3.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.1.
1.7.5.3.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.2.
1.7.6. Con: People waste time on many things, but sometimes time spent serving others or gaining a deeper understanding of the Scriptures or the Tanakh is beneficial because those activities teach people to do good to all.
1.7.6.1. Pro: The Bible also gives people a meaningful reason for doing good, the hope of everlasting life in paradise. [jw.org](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/books/road-to-life/true-religion-benefit-forever/)
1.7.6.1.1. Con: A "meaningful" reason would have foundation in fact.
1.7.6.2. Con: Doing good when you're forced to by the unquestionable obligation to avoid hell is slavery. The ends do not justify the means.
1.7.6.2.1. Pro: Doing good must be voluntary to have any meaning.
1.7.6.2.2. Pro: The hellfire doctrine itself is slavery. Jesus came to free those in spiritual bondage. [Hebrews 2:14-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=heb+2%3A14-15&version=NASB)
1.7.6.3. Pro: One way the [Bible](http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-28.htm) has helped many is what it teaches about the family. That husbands should "love their wives as they love their own bodies". Men who do this are good husbands who strive to never be abusive.
1.7.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.6.
1.7.6.3.2. Con: Religion has often failed to [condemn](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-18/domestic-violence-church-submit-to-husbands/8652028) domestic abuse, and some of its [tenets](https://vawnet.org/sites/default/files/materials/files/2016-09/AR_VAWReligion_0.pdf) have been used to [justify](http://www.the-ripple-effect.info/pdf/ReligiousViewsOfDomesticViolence.pdf) it.
1.7.6.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.2.
1.7.6.3.3. Con: The passage the parent is from, [Ephesians 5:25-29](http://biblehub.com/niv/ephesians/5.htm) puts it in context: It emphasizes the body over the person, the wife as a physical idol, the husband's toy to wash to show his righteousness. A degree of sanity returns in the afterthought, Ephesians 5:33, "However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself", but still the wife is not treated as her own person but as an extension of the man, and what if the man hates and/or abuses himself?
1.7.6.4. Pro: The [Bible](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/wp20150601/how-to-be-a-good-parent/) teaches parents how best to raise their children. Love them, listen to them, and train them.
1.7.6.4.1. Con: The bible [teaches](http://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-13.htm) you to beat your children, a practice commonly considered to be abuse by today's standards.
1.7.6.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.9.7.1.1.
1.7.6.4.3. Con: The quoted link doesn't refer to training, but to "[inculcate](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/study-bible/books/deuteronomy/6/#v5006005-v5006007)" \(which can be described as instil or teach something by [persistent instruction](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/inculcate)\) children \(who, being children and thus impressionable, are effectively brainwashed\) in the word of God.
1.7.6.4.4. Con: The reference to "quick to listen" in the quoted link is not in reference to children but is for the believers themselves to "accept with mildness the [implanting of the word](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/study-bible/books/james/1/#v59001019-v59001021)".
1.7.6.4.5. Con: The link in the parent provides no explicit support for its claims about loving children but for a single anecdote and some comments supporting love in general.
1.7.6.5. Pro: How does one do more than pay lip service to "Love you neighbor"? Perhaps by disaster [relief](https://www.jw.org/en/news/jw/region/united-states/hurricane-harvey-jehovahs-witnesses-cope/#?insight\[search_id\]=0a9e8f9b-84ed-4eb2-b8b5-90591d2cd400&insight\[search_result_index\]=3).
1.7.6.5.1. Con: A recent [gallup poll](http://news.gallup.com/poll/224378/religious-giving-down-charity-holding-steady.aspx) suggests that atheists/agnostics donate roughly the same amount of money to charity as religious people.
1.7.6.5.1.1. Con: The [Gallup poll](http://news.gallup.com/poll/224378/religious-giving-down-charity-holding-steady.aspx) has a small sample size, around 1,050 people, and about [15%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_States) self-identify as without religion. This means that from their random sampling they have roughly 157 agnostic/atheist individuals, which amounts to little evidence to support the parent.
1.7.6.5.2. Con: [Disaster relief](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=5239) is channeled by governments as well as many [charities](https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/corporate-citizenship-center/descriptions-nonprofits-working-disasters), some religious and some non-religous.
1.7.6.5.3. Pro: Jehovah’s Witnesses quickly organized themselves to help after Katrina setting up 13 relief centers, 9 warehouses, and 4 fuel depots, with more than 17,000 volunteers spending much time and effort helping their brothers and others. Some relocated permanently to the area. All charitable organizations and churches can do [this.](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/g200808/A-Love-More-Powerful-Than-a-Hurricane/#?insight\[search_id\]=dd62894e-ce6f-42cd-a7ae-873bcd17908b&insight\[search_result_index\]=7) Many others did, too.
1.7.6.5.3.1. Con: The fact that they only counted the houses of their followers, the rest relegated to "assisted a number of nonbelievers as well", suggests that the "number" would have been quoted if it wasn't embarrassingly low.
1.7.6.5.3.1.1. Con: With limited resources, any organization can only do so much.
1.7.6.5.4. Pro: There are many [examples](https://www.nationalservice.gov/pdf/katrina_volunteers_respond.pdf) of of non-government aid after hurricane Katrina.
1.7.6.5.4.1. Con: Some of those non-profit [organizations](https://www.nationalservice.gov/pdf/katrina_volunteers_respond.pdf) are not religious but created by philanthropists to promote service and voluntarism. For example, [Points of Light](http://www.pointsoflight.org/facts), [Travelers Aid](https://www.travelersaid.org/history/), the [Red Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross), among others, or even [students](https://midsouthredcross.wordpress.com/2016/03/25/red-cross-volunteers-sacrifice-holidays-to-serve-in-louisiana/) who sacrificed Spring Break to help in such disasters.
1.7.6.6. Con: Studying scripture teaches one more about scripture. What effects that has on behavior is determined by what is said in the texts. Depending on what text or section of text is studied it may teach someone to commit violence or to oppress people or to become bigoted rather than to do good to all.
1.7.6.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.8.
1.7.6.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.
1.7.6.6.3. Con: The effect of studying Scripture \(the Bible\) depends on whether the student is [willing](https://www.esv.org/resources/esv-global-study-bible/how-to-read-and-understand-the-bible/) to accept the [totality](https://theblazingcenter.com/2017/03/how-to-understand-the-bible.html) of its [teachings](https://theblazingcenter.com/2017/03/how-to-understand-the-bible.html#entire) rather than rely on only parts of it or on other texts or on deduced ideas.
1.7.6.6.3.1. Pro: "All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, so that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work." \(2Ti 3:16, 17\) This is a very bold claim, but millions of Bible readers have found this to be true. Not everyone, of course. Understanding requires a measure of faith.
1.7.6.6.3.2. Con: The totality of the teachings of the bible is a subjective determination which depends on who is reading it.
1.7.6.6.3.3. Con: If some teachings are about violence, revenge and pettiness and others are about love, forgiveness and compassion, it is unclear which ones should [prevail](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/blogging_the_bible/2009/03/good_book.html).
1.7.6.6.3.3.1. Pro: Moreover, depending on the personality of the reader, the negative teachings may just have a bigger influence than the positive ones.
1.8. Pro: Religion has motivated numerous selfless acts such as volunteering and charity.
1.8.1. Pro: "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world." \([James 1](http://biblehub.com/james/1-27.htm)\). Where a religion does this type of thing it is beneficial to the community and nation.
1.8.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.
1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.21.3.
1.8.4. Pro: Ramadan, which is the act of fasting, no food or water until sunset, shows us how poverty is, we experience the unfortunate's condition. So they stop being 'them' and start being 'us'. We understand their struggle and so we give charity, help and share their pain.
1.8.4.1. Con: Or we decide that it wasn't so bad, so it's okay to keep exploiting them.
1.8.4.1.1. Pro: What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
1.8.4.2. Con: People who live in freedom can fast, abandon their possessions \(temporary or permanently\) and experience all types of circumstances without religion. For example the [Erasmus Project](http://ec.europa.eu/assets/eac/education/images/infograph/2016-erasmus-impact.jpg) which allows students to "live" other cultures in order to embrace peace and democratic coexistence.
1.8.4.3. Con: Fasting does not show how poverty is, since when people live in poverty they don't know for certain that there will be food at sunset. Starvation until sunset is different from indefinite starvation. Those who fast are not being poor by starving until sunset.
1.8.4.4. Con: Fasting during Ramadan is very easy: those fasting can eat as much as they want from sunset to sunrise. Generally, people don't need to eat at night, as they had food during the day. Ramadan just reverses the timings from day to night.
1.8.5. Pro: Religion has been a great pillar for humanity, although religious leaders must put their structures and messages at the service of “Educating” people on global values. Which means a strong work on individuals and civil society as a way to replace the lack of action from global leaders and institutions. Is it time for a solid joint action from all religious leaders on a coordinated organisation towards peace values.
1.8.6. Con: Many religions [require](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakat) the followers to do charity, threatening them with poor prospects in the afterlife if they do otherwise.
1.8.7. Pro: [Studies](http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/almanac/who_gives_most_to_charity/) have shown that on average, most religious states in the US give more to charity than less religious ones.
1.8.7.1. Con: Studies \(e.g. [This on researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301888671_A_Simple_Act_of_Charity_The_Characteristics_and_Complexities_of_Charitable_Giving_in_the_United_Kingdom)\) have shown that the poor give a greater percentage of their budget to charity than the rich. This means that charity is not necessarily a good thing because it's possibly receiving more from the needy than it can justify from its spending on the needy \(maybe different needy\), particularly when a certain proportion of contributions goes to a religion's expenses, savings, and investments in buildings, paintings, sculptures etc.
1.8.7.1.1. Con: [Charitable people are happier](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170711112441.htm), thus the poor donating is good for them.
1.8.7.1.1.1. Con: This study was of 50 people who were given money to spend on either themselves or on someone else. This does not generalize to poor people who are spending their own money which they have little of.
1.8.7.2. Con: The data provided does not investigate the impact of religion on charity and it is therefore misinforming.
1.8.7.3. Con: Experts suggest that those who are more charitable, do so not for their religious or humanists beliefs, but based on the [social connections](http://ideas.time.com/2013/11/26/religious-people-are-more-charitable/) and ties they have with charities.
1.8.7.3.1. Pro: In that sense, if "[secular](http://ideas.time.com/2013/11/26/religious-people-are-more-charitable/) organizations could replicate the sort of tight, interlocking friendship networks found within religious organizations" it is likely they can achieve a "comparable level of charitable giving".
1.8.7.4. Con: -> See 1.7.6.5.1.
1.8.7.5. Con: [Research](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822\(15\)01167-7) has shown that children who receive a religious upbringin \(Christian or Muslim\) are less generous and altruistic than their atheist contempories.
1.8.8. Con: Charity is used to perpetuate inequality.
1.8.8.1. Pro: With charity one establishes a relationship of dependence with one end of the relationship deemed morally, economically and socially superior, while the other is seen as inferior, as an unproductive and degraded burden. Charity serves to make the charitable person feel good with him or herself, while making the recipient of charity feel dependent and inferior. It might be better if, instead of charity, the true causes of inequality were analyzed.
1.8.8.2. Con: Charity allows us to bring the disenfranchised back into the team, and demonstrates the effectiveness of it.
1.8.8.3. Pro: Some charity to third world countries holds them back, fostering [aid dependenc](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/failure-of-foreign-aid-in-developing-countries-a-quest-for-alternatives-2151-6219-1000231.php?aid=80040)y and eliminating self-reliance.
1.8.8.4. Pro: There is little motivation for religions to act against poverty as lasting change would lower the contributions they receive.
1.8.8.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.1.
1.8.8.4.2. Pro: Religious policy against contraception produces large families and thus poverty and thus higher contributions to the religion.
1.8.9. Con: Those who are not religious, also partake in charity and selfless acts, therefore there must be other sources for it than religion.
1.8.9.1. Pro: To assert that religion is the driving force of charity, then it should be true that in the absence of religion, the same people would not have found other motivating factors for their selfless actions. Religious belief and selfless actions may share a common cause, such as a desire for meaning or connection to others. Or causation may run from selflessness to religious belief.
1.8.9.1.1. Con: Religion can be a driving force for charity while not being the sole driving force for charity. Religion may be "the medicine one needs" for one person to facilitate a charitable heart, science for another.
1.8.9.2. Pro: Many atheists and agnostics volunteer and take part on charity, which suggests that these acts have little or nothing to do with religion.
1.8.9.2.1. Con: These atheists overwhelming live and were raised in countries and cultures which at some point derived their moral and ethical principles from religious sources. All of the most major religions spiritually incentivise charity.
1.8.9.2.1.1. Con: The Humanist ideals, which [diverged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism#From_Renaissance_to_modern_humanism) from religion a long time ago, also support a wide range of [secular charities](https://humanism.org.uk/humanism/humanism-today/humanists-doing/good-causes-and-charities/). It is disingenuous to associate this voluntary work with a religious influence.
1.8.9.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.5.
1.8.9.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.5.1.
1.8.9.3. Pro: Religion is not the motivation, it only appeals to existing human values and social behaviour. These values and behaviour lead to selfless acts without Religion.
1.8.9.3.1. Pro: Religion had the monopoly of charity for several years and for sure this affected the way we volunteer now. But we are human and in our nature we are supposed to live in "herds", so we'd find a way to help each other even without religion. It's a matter of life or death.
1.8.9.3.2. Con: Religion can be the motivation. Many religious followers do good deeds, for example, because they think it makes them a good person and will grant them access to a positive afterlife.
1.8.9.3.2.1. Pro: Religion provides hope that something good will happen if you continue doing good deeds. And it is reassuring that some entity is looking after my affairs.
1.8.9.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.3.
1.8.9.3.2.1.2. Con: No, religion provides hope that something good will happen if you follow God's will, which is simply assumed to be good in most religions. However, God's will, depending on your religion, can be arbitrarily uneducated, primitive and cruel, usually in line with how old the religion is and how glorified its uneducated and primitive founders are.
1.8.9.3.2.2. Con: The assumption that there is an omniscient creature watching you does not make you good. It is the reward for coded behavior that is heaven. The choice to be good is simple trade.
1.8.9.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.20.
1.8.9.3.4. Pro: A good, moral person is a good moral person... if they are religious or not is not dependent upon their moral compass. Acts are based on personality traits, not religious beliefs.
1.8.9.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.3.
1.8.9.3.6. Pro: Many moral philosophies which don't depend on God, such as [Kantian moral philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/), also promote volunteerism and beneficence, without allowing for the possibility of abuse and misinterpretation by one group of people. Such philosophies could found virtuous acts instead of religion.
1.8.10. Pro: Religious organizations make it easier for people to come together and help their communities. People know to go to the church or the mosque or the temple in order to find direction to help their communities.
1.8.10.1. Con: The refers to the community itself, not religion. There are many non-religious communities that facilitate helping others.
1.8.10.2. Con: Due to past charitable acts, people believe that the church is the place to go to do charitable acts. However, other charities exist, and are more easily available than going to a church.
1.8.10.3. Con: Having people go to sectarian centers to foster community also fosters division between those sects that would not be there had they all just gone to a universal community center.
1.8.10.3.1. Con: Many religious communities [engage](http://www.cofebirmingham.com/church-life/interfaith/) with those of different faiths.
1.8.10.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.
1.8.11. Con: Many religious based charity movements tie in spreading propaganda with the offered aid.
1.8.11.1. Con: Religious-based charities consider religious teachings a good thing, therefore in their opinion there is nothing wrong in giving aid with religious propaganda attached.
1.8.11.1.1. Con: Having the opinion that an action you take is not wrong does not change whether it is actually wrong or not.
1.8.11.2. Pro: This wastes time and resources that would be better spent on giving actual aid.
1.8.11.3. Pro: Aid is given to those in harsh/poor/stressful circumstances, and these people are easily influenced. If religion is bad, it is immoral to force it upon them in these circumstances \(or indeed in any circumstance\).
1.8.11.4. Pro: Aid is given to those without power, and therefore they may be forced to accept propaganda in order to accept the aid that goes with it.
1.8.11.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.1.2.5.
1.9. Pro: Religion serves as a meeting ground for people to come together, network and create long lasting relationships.
1.9.1. Pro: Religion provides a sense of community and purpose to people who might otherwise become isolated from social groups.
1.9.1.1. Con: People free and capable of critical thinking can decide. Not everyone needs to seek a community to live a happy life, thus many people do not benefit from the sense of community.
1.9.1.2. Con: Religion also has requirements which would make populations unaccepted in those communities. A typical "be like us, or get out" mentality IS isolating from a social group.
1.9.2. Con: These communities tend to work well in creating social bonds between its members, but often also facilitate closed-mindedness or lack of curiosity towards non-members, by forming a common basis of judgment, resulting in the groups's seclusion. Isolated individuals are then often pressurized to assimilate in the belief system before social affirmation can occur.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Religion makes a person belonging to one group, and so they may start thinking about people only belonging to their religion, and become selfish.
1.9.3. Con: Religion is not needed to bring people together; many secular organizations exist that serve the same purpose, such as [Sunday Assembly](http://www.sundayassembly.com/), [The School of Life](https://www.theschooloflife.com/), [the Y](http://www.ymca.net/forabetterus/), etc.
1.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.3.
1.9.5. Con: While religion widely claims to encourage its followers to love their fellow humans - by its very structure and teaching it is divisive, and those that aren't compelled to follow, are by definition 'different' and on the outside of a group of people that have a common belief system.  Anything which segregates and categorises us, cannot bring us together for the greater good of humanity.
1.9.6. Pro: Having a shared religion, therefore a shared worldview, contributes to the trust and coherence within communities.
1.9.7. Con: Religion serves as a meeting ground only between those who already share a belief, it doesn't create new common grounds. Therefore it doesn't create unity.
1.9.7.1. Pro: Bringing people who already believe the same thing together just furthers confirmation bias and creates an echo chamber.
1.9.8. Con: Community sovereignty can be achieved without the use of a omnipresent/omnipotent deity.
1.9.8.1. Pro: A prime example is the Koorie people of "Australia" living in perfect unison with nature rather than above it. With healthy philosophy which allowed them to become the oldest [human race](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/indigenous-australians-know-were-the-oldest-living-culture-its-in-our-dreamtime) on the planet and their culture which still persists despite the current genocidal behavior the Australian government has been displaying for the last two decades.\(btw our current prime minister is religious\)
1.9.9. Con: -> See 1.6.4.1.2.
1.9.10. Con: That is true, but in fact it's the same for almost everything else on this planet. Even terrorism and imprisonment will do exactly the same thing.
1.9.10.1. Pro: In fact, with the advent of the Internet, we no longer need other ways to unite and form communities.
1.9.10.1.1. Pro: Large social networks such as Facebook and Twitter or smaller ones such as Kailo serve as good examples.
1.9.10.1.2. Con: In most cases, social media is not a healthy alternative to real life communities. Text can not convey physical presence.
1.9.10.1.2.1. Con: The internet and social media allow people to meet people they otherwise never would and can help organize in person meetings.
1.9.10.1.2.2. Con: We are not these crude vessels, we are beings of thought, creation, and emotion. Our bodies are our tools, our interface with physical reality, and our mortality. Physical presence does not make a meeting of minds. The last person you should ever know could look and move like the star of your wet dreams. Your ideal friend could physically repulse you.
1.9.10.2. Con: Everything else does not develop relationships in exactly the same way. Your relationship with your prison gang would not be the same relationship with your old youth group at least not at first.
1.9.10.3. Con: Coming together, networking, and creating long-lasting relationships has been done most effectively via [religion](http://communication.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228613-e-166).
1.9.11. Pro: Places of worship provide spaces for community unity.
1.9.11.1. Con: Secular spaces such as pubs, schools, neighborhood associations, civic events, and parks do this as well.
1.9.11.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.3.
1.9.11.2. Pro: Religion is a good way for the elderly to socialize.
1.10. Pro: Religious beliefs have pragmatic value.
1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.4.
1.10.2. Con: Not all religious beliefs have pragmatic value.  Whether you believe in the holy trinity of God or not is neutral as far as pragmatism goes.
1.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.10.4. Con: Pragmatism is not always a positive trait. Many violent acts have pragmatic values for some.
1.10.4.1. Con: In the vast majority of cases though, this will not be the case. Either can lead to reprisals and either can lead to non-productive members of society, through incarceration, PTSD, mourning, or death.
1.10.4.2. Con: The classic theory is that WWII would have been avoided if someone had assassinated Hitler, but by the time he was a target he was also a potential martyr. It's plausible that had he been murdered someone smarter would have picked up the baton and the Germans would have been more motivated and thus won
1.10.4.3. Pro: Any individual leader might want to murder some of his opposition or a former spy. Doing so would be incredibly pragmatic from their point of view.
1.10.4.4. Pro: A child killing a parent for inheritance is would be pragmatic.
1.10.4.5. Pro: In business killing off a competitor could be pragmatic.
1.10.4.6. Pro: If someone is blackmailing you then killing them might be pragmatic.
1.10.4.7. Pro: If a noble house wants to take control of a country they might arrange to kidnap the Queen or princess in order to bear a child by them so that they may name themselves regent and have their heir rule on afterwards.
1.10.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.6.2.
1.10.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.
1.10.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.2.5.

1.10.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.10.
1.10.11. Con: Superstitions, in general, have pragmatic value for human society - for example, scaring a child with stories of ghosts waiting in the darkness might have, on many occasion, saved the lives of children who'd be too scared to venture out alone in dangerous places. This kind of "psychological fencing" works well to prevent foolishness among the very young and immature, but for rational and mature humans, it's better to be "pragmatic" and let such indoctrinated beliefs go.
1.10.11.1. Con: Many religions do much more than just psychological fencing. Considering for how long many of the texts have existed, it is reasonable to assume that they serve as a metaphor and an insight into human nature. Through the millennia that these stories may have existed, they have served as a guide and motivator for people on how to live an acceptable life.
1.10.11.2. Con: Religions engage as collectives and in a comforting way with deep existential questions and fears that rational, pragmatic and mature adult humans can have great difficulty facing alone.
1.10.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.6.
1.10.13. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.1.
1.11. Pro: Most of today's cultures and remaining world heritage are due to religions.
1.11.1. Con: Technological evolution explains our cultural heritage. Religion is only a theme used in cultural expression among many other secular themes.
1.11.2. Con: Religion is mankind's first attempt to make sense of the world. Had we, as a species, been more naturally inclined to reason and science, many works of art, temples and statues might have been erected in their honor.
1.11.3. Pro: Religion has been key in the creation and preservation of art and culture.
1.11.3.1. Pro: Many of the ancient buildings which were built to a high enough standard to survive to the present day were built for religious reasons.
1.11.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.21.1.
1.11.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.21.2.
1.11.3.1.3. Con: Throughout history religion has had copious amounts of money and power, and consequently the best constructed buildings and monuments were religious. Had the money been elsewhere different long standing buildings may have been built. It cannot be determined which would be subjectively better or worse.
1.11.3.1.3.1. Con: In a free market economy, the money goes where the consumer's interest is. Followers had to first be interested in spending money on their church in order for them to gain status, power and budget.
1.11.3.1.3.1.1. Con: The Catholic church sold forgiveness of sins. Not going to hell is pretty high up there when it comes to consumer interest.
1.11.3.1.3.1.2. Con: The world was not a free market economy at the time when many major religions showed up. Feudalism was not exactly a free market.
1.11.3.1.3.1.3. Con: Consumer interest in something does not mean it is a good influence on the consumers or the world.
1.11.3.1.4. Pro: Of the [seven wonders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonders_of_the_World) of the world, five are absolutely religiously motivated. Without it, we would never had Pyramids, Taj Mahal and the others. The masterpieces of architecture which define us as a species, nonexistent.
1.11.3.1.4.1. Con: Architecture does not define a species. Humans [prosocial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosocial_behavior) is typically what is referenced as making us distinct from other animals as well as language but other animals build things as well. It seems a bit heavy handed to say that a few architectural structures define us as a species.
1.11.3.1.5. Con: One may argue that religion has created many fascinating architectural wonders and has inspired the arts in general. However, these minor accomplishments can't resurrect the humans and the damage that religion has done unto both people and countries.
1.11.3.1.5.1. Pro: For example, the [islamization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamization_of_Iran) of secular [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Principlism_in_Iran) and right now of [Turkey](https://fanack.com/turkey/history-past-to-present/islamization-of-turkey/).
1.11.3.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.
1.11.3.1.6. Pro: These ancient buildings often contribute to the touristic attractiveness of some places, which in turn contributes to the economy.
1.11.3.2. Pro: Religion has been one of the greatest sources for artistic expression in all of Human history.
1.11.3.2.1. Con: Throughout history religion has had copious amounts of money and power, and consequently many religious works of art were commissioned. Had the money been elsewhere different pieces may have been made. It cannot be determined which would be subjectively better or worse.
1.11.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.11.3.1.3.1.
1.11.3.2.2. Pro: Religion had a huge positive impact on the development of architecture, music and the theatre \(rites originated from mysteries in ancient [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre#Classical_and_Hellenistic_Greece)\).
1.11.3.2.3. Con: Art also exists independently from religion and from western culture.
1.11.3.2.3.1. Con: Art can exist independently from religion, but the fact still remains that many of some of the greatest statues, paintings, music and writing, have been inspired by religion. The exploration of spirituality can and have often lead to artist trying to recreate the beauty of the spiritual.
1.11.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: For instance "[Ode to Joy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._9_\(Beethoven\))" by Beethoven or "[Hallelujah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_\(Handel\))" by Händel as great examples of art inspired by religion.
1.11.3.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Beethoven's religious [beliefs](https://www.crisismagazine.com/2016/beethoven-catholic-church) are a matter of controversy, the song is inspired by a Friederich Schiller's [poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ode_to_Joy) that uses mythology and universal [fraternity](https://www.primephonic.com/news-ode-to-joy-schiller-beethoven-and-the-celebration-of-universal-togetherness) and many see the song as a secular statement of [freedom](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/09/what-does-beethovens-ninth-symphony-mean/62556/) against repression.
1.11.3.2.4. Pro: Without Christianity, there may never have be the cantata, the concerto, or the symphony. [Handel, Vivaldi, and Bach were Christians who worked to honor God with their work](http://www.faithfacts.org/christ-and-the-culture/the-impact-of-christianity).
1.11.3.3. Pro: A great many [historical records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptorium) that preserved knowledge still exist today thanks to religion.
1.11.3.3.1. Con: It is arguable that religion did not save those records but the dedication of the people who saw value in them.
1.11.3.3.1.1. Con: A value instilled in them by religion.
1.11.3.3.2. Con: Religion has been responsible for destroying large amounts of [historical and scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hakam_II#Patron_of_knowledge) heritage.
1.11.3.3.3. Pro: Thanks to religion we have a better understanding of the history of humankind. The knowlege of most ancient civilizations would've been lost if not for their religious expressions \(Egyptian, babylonian, jewish\) and our understanding of historical process would be far worse without the critical analysis of the bible.
1.11.3.3.4. Pro: The Christian church during the Dark Ages  saved vast amounts of scholarly [records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptorium) and established [universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education#Europe) and libraries all over Europe.
1.11.3.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.1.4.2.2.1.
1.11.3.3.4.2. Con: The motives of the [Carolingian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance), thanks to which many of the books in the West were preserved, were only partially religious.
1.11.3.3.4.3. Con: [The first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_universities_in_continuous_operation) European universities were established several centuries after the [Dark Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages_\(historiography\)#Modern_academic_use) ended.
1.11.3.3.4.4. Con: First Universities were spontaneous[corporations of people studying \(Roman\) law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bologna#History), theology and medicine.
1.11.3.3.4.5. Con: That wasn't to support science, that was to monopolise knowledge \(and thus power\) and to destroy any writings that contradicted dogma.
1.11.3.3.4.6. Con: -> See 1.1.21.1.4.2.1.1.
1.11.3.3.4.7. Con: -> See 1.4.3.11.5.
1.11.3.3.5. Con: However, any historical records that still exist today due to a religion are inherently suspect due to religious censorship. That is the records that were saved would likely have been those without heresy, resulting in a warped view of history.
1.11.3.4. Con: But, on the other hand, throughout history there have been many cases where ancient temples and works of art have been damaged, or completely destroyed, for religious reasons.[ISIS destroys archaiological sites](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150901-isis-destruction-looting-ancient-sites-iraq-syria-archaeology/)[Sisitine in Vatican](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/nov/07/michelangelo-sistine-art-vatican)
1.11.3.5. Con: Heritage preservation by religious institutions is not necessary a good thing. It just means that religions had the control of what to conserve, and what to burn.
1.11.3.6. Con: Religion was all too often the cause for destruction of [art objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhas_of_Bamiyan) and whole cultures.
1.11.3.7. Pro: Religious organizations have often financially sponsored some of the most precious and invaluable artists throughout the centuries.
1.11.3.8. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.2.2.
1.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.11.5. Con: Religion has only adapted itself to societal and pagan norms and then claimed credit for them.
1.11.5.1. Pro: The early Christian Church [adopted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_Paganism#Pagan_influences_on_Christianity) a number of pagan traditions.
1.11.5.1.1. Pro: Many Christian [festivities](https://www.ucg.org/vertical-thought/paganism-in-christianity) like Christmas, Eastern or [Saint John’s Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_John%27s_Eve#Traditional_celebrations) are believed to have [pagan](http://www.interigual.com/san-juan-historia-y-tradicion/?lang=en) origins.
1.11.5.2. Pro: Greek ethics were [incorporated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_Hellenistic_philosophy) into early Christianity.
1.11.5.3. Pro: The concept of an [immortal soul](https://www.ucg.org/vertical-thought/paganism-in-christianity) was first believed in ancient Egypt, Babylon and Greece before Christianity.
1.11.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.4.
1.11.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.
1.11.7. Con: In the same way many of past cultures and heritage was destroyed because of religion: [Americas' conquest](http://nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/745), [Middle East in the current century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monuments_damaged_by_conflict_in_the_Middle_East_during_the_21st_century) or [many European so called pagan cultures](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/debra-macleod/pagan-culture_b_7058758.html).
1.11.7.1. Pro: Native American Cultures were destroyed by introducing Christianism.
1.11.7.1.1. Con: Native American Cultures were destroyed by disease and violence that left them a minority.
1.11.8. Pro: Religious rules are the main source of contemporary laws and in some cases contributed to democracy.
1.11.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1.
1.11.8.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.1.
1.11.8.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.5.
1.11.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.11.8.5. Con: Religious rules also contributed in some cases to support laws like the [death penalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Saudi_Arabia#Sharia_background).
1.11.8.6. Con: -> See 1.5.6.3.
1.11.8.7. Pro: Many religious ideas and ideologies have been secularized into laws which protect people, communities, and countries.["...Law can, quite legitimately, be influenced by religion." theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/jan/22/law-religion-relationship-subtle-clarity)[The Interaction of Law and Religion, Harold J. Berman](http://www.socialtheology.com/docs/berman-law-and-religion-000074.pdf)
1.11.8.7.1. Con: "The unrealistic belief that religion is always for the good, however, is a hazardous myth." - Marci A. Hamilton[God vs. the Gavel: Religion and the Rule of Law](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=OtZI1b5ML7EC&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=religion+inspires+current+law&ots=nLNnXIJgYs&sig=DKC4Lxo9xyNU9IZ1Lrb8CMMOHN4#v=onepage&q&f=false)
1.11.8.7.2. Con: Mixing religion and legislation forces the religious views of some on the entire population. Since religion is not required to protect the populous it should not be mingling with the law.
1.11.8.8. Con: Which means that contemporary laws have unjust laws, which would less likely to be a problem without religion.
1.11.8.8.1. Pro: In some [countries](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-06/cp170071en.pdf), churches don't have to pay [taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_exemption#Charitable_and_religious_organizations).
1.11.8.8.1.1. Pro: In some European countries, churches even collect public [taxes](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/22/in-some-european-countries-church-membership-means-paying-more-taxes/).
1.11.8.8.2. Pro: Girls are forced to wear skirts at school
1.11.8.8.3. Pro: Woman weren't allowed to vote until recently
1.11.8.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.3.
1.11.8.8.4. Pro: Some religions force people to kill non worshippers
1.11.8.8.4.1. Pro: Religious people believe that the God will punish non-worshiped people in the hell, so it seems a 'good' action to kill them.
1.11.8.8.4.1.1. Pro: Murdering someone in any system with rule of law is not a moral or good action.
1.11.8.8.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.4.
1.11.8.8.5. Pro: It used to be punishable by [death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zina) to have sex outside of marriage and some countries still [penalize](http://www.futurescopes.com/romance/love-and-sex/3243/countries-where-sex-outside-marriage-crime) extra-marital sex.
1.11.8.8.5.1. Pro: In some Islamic countries, women are incarcerated after being [raped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zina#Human_rights_controversy) since it is considered adultery and thus legally punished.
1.11.8.8.6. Pro: Homosexuality was [illegal](https://76crimes.com/76-countries-where-homosexuality-is-illegal/) and still is in some countries, and [marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage#Same-sex_marriage_around_the_world) is still not legal in many places.
1.11.8.8.7. Pro: There are laws that favour churches over morality.
1.11.8.8.7.1. Pro: Laws allow priests to not report crimes said in confession.
1.11.8.8.7.1.1. Pro: In Australia, churches have said if the law changes and priests legally have to report child abuse to police, especially in a [confession](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-abuse/catholic-church-in-australia-rejects-mandatory-reporting-of-child-abuse-discussed-in-confessional-idUSKCN1LG057), that the [priests](https://www.voanews.com/a/catholic-church-rejects-australian-laws-on-reporting-child-abuse/4551967.html) would break the [law](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/south-australia-catholic-church-to-ignore-law-on-reporting-confessions-of-abuse). So, even when the law forces priests to [report](https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2018/0831/990672-australia-church-abuse-laws/) it, they might not.
1.11.8.8.7.1.1.1. Pro: Bishops have been allowing priests to abuse children for decades in Australian Christian Churches.
1.11.8.8.7.2. Pro: There are many claims of child abuse in the church that go unreported until the child grows up.
1.11.8.8.7.2.1. Pro: Laws don't force priests to report child abuse they know other priests are committing.
1.11.8.8.7.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.3.1.
1.11.8.8.7.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.7.1.2.1.

1.11.8.8.7.2.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.3.2.
1.11.8.8.7.2.1.5. Pro: It has taken a long time for the government to [improve](https://theconversation.com/should-priests-be-made-to-report-child-abuse-revealed-in-confession-103234) the laws to prevent religions doing this.
1.11.8.9. Con: Countries that are more secular and tolerant, with socially liberal [laws](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/secular-countries-may-have-more-economic-growth-study/articleshow/65051994.cms), often opposed by religion, are more likely to have more economic growth.
1.11.8.9.1. Pro: Those laws include legalizing same-sex relationships, divorce, abortion, etc.
1.11.8.10. Con: It is true that religion may have codified & disseminated basic natural/moral values/principles necessary for human co-existence in society and long term survival as a species. But it's a long stretch to assert that those same principles were created by religion.
1.11.8.11. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.2.2.1.1.
1.11.8.12. Pro: Christianity has been integral for the development of [democracy](https://creation.com/the-christian-foundations-of-the-rule-of-law-in-the-west-a-legacy-of-liberty-and-resistance-against-tyranny) and the rule of law in Western World and all the good that has come from it and helped people to resist totalitarian rule in these nations.
1.11.8.12.1. Con: Christianity is actually anti-democracy: it is more authoritarian at its core as it has one power above all \(God\).
1.11.8.12.1.1. Pro: Christianity and monotheism in general often refer to adherents as sheep in a flock and Christians sometimes characterize themselves as [slaves to Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6%3A6%2CColossians+3%3A24%2C1+Peter+2%3A16&version=NASB) this is totalitarian.
1.11.8.12.1.2. Pro: Christianity along with its monotheistic cousins require that one both loves and [fears](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/Fear-Of-God,-Results-Of) god. This is the basis of a sadomasochistic relationship illustrating the religion's totalitarian nature.
1.11.8.12.2. Pro: Robert Woodberry wrote his doctoral thesis on the overwhelmingly positive impact of Protestant missionaries: "The missionary roots of liberal [democracy](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235503063_The_Missionary_Roots_of_Liberal_Democracy)".
1.11.8.12.2.1. Pro: The study proves historically and statistically that conversionary Protestants "heavily influenced the rise and spread of stable democracy around the world", being "a crucial catalyst" for religious liberty, mass education, mass printing, newspapers, voluntary organizations, and colonial reforms.
1.11.8.12.3. Con: While Christianity undoubtedly had a large impact on western civilization saying it is the source discredits many important contributors from before Christianity. Ancient Greece and Rome have both contributed to the legal and political systems of western civilization and both predated Christianity. [Legacy of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Roman_Empire). [Birth of Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_democracy#Historic_origins)
1.11.8.12.4. Con: [Fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#World_War_I_and_its_aftermath_\(1914%E2%80%931929\)), a form of totalitarianism that opposed liberal democracy, originated in Europe and ruled in Italy, Germany and Spain.
1.11.9. Pro: Christiantiy has been integral to Western civilization.
1.11.9.1. Pro: Our calendar's \([Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar)\) year zero represents the birth of Jesus Christ
1.11.9.1.1. Con: While this is what various religions suggest, historians including religious ones cannot agree on the actual date of birth.
1.11.9.2. Con: Christianity has been a part of Western society, but it having had a net positive effect is not a given.
1.11.9.2.1. Pro: Religion has historically opposed science
1.11.9.2.1.1. Con: The Dalai Lama is convinced that religion and science are [not mutually exclusive](https://www.dalailama.com/messages/buddhism/science-and-religion). He explains that they are [complementary sources](https://www.thoughtco.com/buddhism-and-science-449729) of knowledge and that none should be excluded.
1.11.9.2.1.1.1. Con: Some religious beliefs are indeed contrary to science and in no way complementary.
1.11.9.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: An example: [Flat Earth Societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies). Either the Earth is flat as some religions suggest or it is round as science \(part of which is observation\) proves.
1.11.9.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: One relevant example: The theory of [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) makes it impossible for the existence of [Adam and Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve) as described in Genesis.
1.11.9.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.1.4.2.4.

1.11.9.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.1.4.2.1.
1.11.9.2.1.5. Pro: In order to maintain its power, the Church has wanted to be the center of the rationalism thinking, erasing for ages the science developing and using instruments as faith and hell threat to keep the power.
1.11.9.2.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.1.4.2.3.
1.11.9.2.1.7. Con: And science has slowed down religious progress, cf. Marx, Freud, Skinner, et al.
1.11.9.2.1.7.1. Con: It hasn't necessarily been bad when science slowed down religion.
1.11.9.2.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.3.
1.11.9.2.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.8.3.1.
1.11.9.2.1.10. Con: During the golden age of Islam, the faith was a major source of support for the advancement of science.
1.11.9.2.1.10.1. Con: Religious islamic dogma also helped end the [Golden Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvkBlpfbFJM&feature=youtu.be) and has not recovered intellectually or scientifically to this day.
1.11.9.2.1.10.1.1. Con: [Researchers](https://web.archive.org/web/20150402150434/http://www.history-science-technology.com/articles/articles%208.html) point at other causes \(rather than religion or theologians\) of the end of the golden age, because religion encouraged the study of sciences.
1.11.9.2.1.10.2. Pro: The rise of [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age#Religious_influence) saw the rise of support for [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_attitudes_towards_science), the wider adoption of [Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_in_medieval_Islam), and numerous other technological innovations, as well as an increase in general prosperity.
1.11.9.2.1.10.2.1. Pro: The [Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age#Religious_influence) \(8th century to the 14th century\) is a period in which "science, economic development and cultural works flourished".
1.11.9.2.1.10.2.2. Con: Correlation does not imply cause and effect.
1.11.9.2.1.10.2.3. Con: Post hoc ergo proter hoc. It is a common phenomenon that a large common transportation, linguistic and judicial medium coupled with a grade of cultural tolerance - as it was during the first centuries of Islam - allows for a rapid spread of ideas and thus a boost in arts, sciences and technology.
1.11.9.2.1.10.2.3.1. Pro: The creation of the [Achaemenid empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire) created such a medium and induced a rapid progress e.g. in [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome#Persian_domes) and [irrigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qanat#Origins), while religious motives played a marginal role in the empire building.
1.11.9.2.1.10.2.3.2. Pro: Greek expansion over Mediterranean and Black seas created such a medium, eventually sparking the Greek Golden Age, but it was not religiously motivated.
1.11.9.2.1.10.2.3.3. Pro: Macedonian conquests and forming of Hellenic states had nothing to do with the spread of a religion, yet the medium they've created allowed for the most spectacular bloom of science, art and technology before the Early Modern Era.
1.11.9.2.1.10.2.3.4. Pro: Today's Globalization is not religiously motivated.
1.11.9.2.1.10.2.3.5. Pro: Roman empire saw the last bloom of the Greek scientific thought, and promoted the spread of [numerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_glass)[advanced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_concrete) [technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ancient_watermills), while for the upper classes and urban centers religion was becoming more of a tradition as a belief.
1.11.9.2.1.11. Con: In the "[Dark Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages)" \(Early Middle Ages\) scientific development has been arrested due to poor economic condition and political stability. After this period the Church was in fact the largest single benefactor of science in history. Tragic conflicts with individuals like Galileo do not represent the general picture.
1.11.9.2.1.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.13.
1.11.9.3. Pro: Western civilization via Christianity has given us great works of [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_art).
1.11.9.3.1. Con: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.
1.11.9.3.2. Pro: Western Civilization via Christianity has given the world great [musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_music) compositions.
1.11.9.3.3. Con: -> See 1.11.3.2.3.
1.11.9.4. Pro: Western Civilization via Christianity has given the world a great educational system.
1.11.9.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.3.4.
1.11.9.4.2. Con: The earliest forms of formal [schooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education#Education_in_ancient_civilization) were developed in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.
1.11.9.4.3. Con: City-states in ancient [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education#Education_in_ancient_civilization) provided private education in literacy, arts and gymnastics for young boys \(from 7 to 14 years old\) mimicking modern formal schooling way before Christianity.
1.11.9.4.4. Con: Ancient [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education#Education_in_ancient_civilization) also developed forms of higher education where rich students could contniue their studies, learning rhetoric, mathematics, geography, natural history, politics, and logic.
1.11.9.4.4.1. Pro: In fact, the Hellenistic influence in modern education can be traced in the word [Lyceum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyceum), Aristotle's school named after its location, and a current terminology that many Western and Eastern countries still use.
1.11.9.4.5. Pro: Medieval universities started as [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education#Education_in_ancient_civilization) monastic schools and  modern systems of education in Europe derive from schools founded upon religious principles with the primary purpose of training the clergy.
1.11.9.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.2.6.1.
1.11.9.5. Pro: Western civilization via Christianity has made great contributions to philosophy and modern thought.
1.11.9.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.5.4.
1.11.9.5.2. Pro: During the [Middle Ages](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Western-philosophy/Medieval-philosophy), St. Augustine and St. Ambrose both studied earlier [philosophers](https://quatr.us/romans/roman-philosophy-ancient-rome.htm), assimilating Greek and Roman philosophy -the basis of Western thought- into Christian doctrine, trying to give a rational interpretation of Christian faith.
1.11.9.5.3. Con: -> See 1.2.13.8.3.
1.11.9.5.4. Con: -> See 1.1.21.1.2.4.1.
1.11.9.6. Con: Being an integral part is not necessarily a "good" thing. It is impossible to know what society would be like in the absence of Christianity, but we do know that modern societies are becoming more secular.
1.11.9.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.
1.11.9.6.2. Pro: [Research](https://247wallst.com/special-report/2014/10/07/the-10-states-with-the-worst-quality-of-life/) in the US, shows that in most sociological measures of well-being, states with less levels or religion [fare better](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-secular-life/201410/secular-societies-fare-better-religious-societies) than more [religious](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/29/how-religious-is-your-state/?state=alabama) states.
1.11.9.6.2.1. Con: The correlation is the opposite than suggested above. Countries and states do not fare better because they lose their religiosity - they lose their religiosity when they find ways to establish functioning institutions to address the needs of their citizens who then no longer need to rely solely on hope and prayer.
1.11.9.6.2.1.1. Con: Therefore, religiosity is not necessary for societies' well-being if other secular and collective institutions are strong enough.
1.11.9.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.2.
1.11.9.6.2.1.2. Con: It is pure speculation to suggest that they lose religiosity only after having needs addressed so that prayer and hope need not be relied on. Prayer has been shown to be ineffective and hope need not be religious. The correlation is that as societies lose religiosity they become more successful, to suggest that the success causes the loss of religiosity is pure speculation. All we know is that success and lack of religion in this case go hand in hand.
1.11.9.6.2.2. Pro: There is a stark correlation between the 10 [most religious](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/29/how-religious-is-your-state/?state=alabama) states and the 10 [worst states](https://247wallst.com/special-report/2014/10/07/the-10-states-with-the-worst-quality-of-life/4/) in quality of life \(9 out of 10 coincidence\) and between the 10 [less religious](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/29/how-religious-is-your-state/?state=alabama) states and the [10 best one](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/10/11/24-7-wall-st-states-quality-of-life/16960973/)s \(7 out of 10 coincidence\).
1.11.9.6.2.3. Con: Correlation does not mean causation.
1.11.9.6.2.3.1. Pro: People living in poor and in conflict areas tend to be religious, because they need religion. They are not unsuccessful because they are religious, they are religious because they are unsuccessful.
1.11.9.6.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.8.8.4.
1.11.9.6.2.3.1.2. Con: It's a stretch to suggest that anyone "needs" religion.
1.11.9.6.2.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.2.2.
1.11.9.6.2.3.1.4. Pro: Religious groups aiding poor countries may potentially sway that poor community to follow said religion. The correlation doesn't mean religion is making countries poor, it can be poor communities leading to religion.
1.11.9.6.2.3.1.4.1. Con: Christianity for example preaches that suffering is good and so when they proselytize to the poor and in some case give some amounts of charity they tell them their suffering is good and keep them poor where they want them.
1.11.9.6.2.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.5.3.
1.11.9.6.2.3.1.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.6.
1.11.9.6.2.3.1.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.
1.11.9.6.2.3.2. Con: One way or the other, there seems to be a clear link between development and religiosity and it is clear that religiosity fares better when a country is less developed.
1.11.9.6.2.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.4.
1.11.9.6.2.3.2.2. Con: Without some way to reliably measure "religiosity" it is impossible to state whether societies are more, or less, religious given their economic status.
1.11.9.6.2.3.2.2.1. Con: [Gallup](http://news.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx) and [Pew](http://www.pewresearch.org/methodology/international-survey-research/international-methodology/all-survey/all-country/all-year) polls, for instances, are made with large samples of respondents in each country who are asked if religion is important for them \(or in their lives\). Self-report surveys may be limited as research tools, but they do provide some reliable data and are used in a huge variety of fields.
1.11.9.6.2.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.2.1.1.
1.11.9.6.2.3.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.2.1.
1.11.9.6.2.3.2.5. Pro: According to [research](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/do-countries-lose-religion-as-they-gain-wealth-1.1310451), "religion is most able to thrive in seriously dysfunctional societies".
1.11.9.6.2.3.2.6. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.2.
1.11.9.6.2.3.3. Pro: Correlation does not imply causation. It is difficult to determine if societies are more economically successful because they are less religious or the opposite. Maybe societies are less religious because they are more economically successful.  The negative correlation between economic success and religiosity does not favor one conclusion over the other.
1.11.9.6.2.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.11.9.6.2.3.2.
1.11.9.6.2.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.2.2.1.
1.11.9.6.2.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.1.4.2.2.
1.11.9.6.2.4. Con: Religiousness is associated with [lower suicide rates](https://buff.ly/2EF3ySe).
1.11.9.6.2.4.1. Con: Most religions dictate that suicide will land you a spot in hell, a place of everlasting unimaginable amounts of suffering. Lower suicide rates are not necessarily because people feel better but because they fear a much worse worse fate than their current state. The psychological problems still remain.
1.11.9.6.3. Pro: The secularization of society shows that religion, if it ever had a positive influence, has lost it in recent times.
1.11.9.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.11.8.
1.11.9.6.4. Con: -> See 1.2.13.
1.11.9.7. Con: We have advanced civilizations that hold no ties to western religion. As such,  religion's effect is not obvious.
1.11.10. Con: China, the world oldest surviving culture is also one in which religion's power is weakest
1.11.10.1. Con: The Cultural Revolution, an explicitly secular movement,  led to the destruction of uncountless cultural artifacts in China.
1.11.11. Con: This assumes there wouldn't have been equal or better culture and world heritage without religion. However, without knowledge of what secular culture would look like, we can not conclude that the religious versions are better and thus a good thing for humanity.
1.11.11.1. Con: It's doubtful anything would have been extremely different, religion or not, some social code or law would have most likely arised. War and discrimination would not be less common, just different.
1.11.11.2. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.11.11.3. Con: Whether religious cultures were better or not is not the point. The point is that without religions, these cultures would likely have been lost like all the secular cultures that didn't survive the passage of time.
1.11.11.3.1. Con: The loss of religious culture is not necessarily a bad thing. Especially since it is often tied to intolerance and bigotry.
1.11.11.3.2. Pro: The only descendant of Bronze Age culture today is that which was passed down by Judeo-Christian religion.
1.11.11.3.3. Con: Druidic culture was largely lost due to the Roman Empire spreading a different religion across Europe.
1.11.11.4. Pro: We can't know all the possible outcomes after one outcome has already occured.
1.11.12. Con: This assumes that culture is a good thing. Religious culture \(as all culture\) often separates us and frequently has us do things the old way, the old way often being inefficient, or has us do old activities, the old activities often being a waste of time or counterproductive
1.12. Pro: Religion is good for the psycho-social wellness of its followers.
1.12.1. Pro: Religion gives people's lives purpose and meaning.
1.12.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.12.1.2. Pro: Religion reminds people to look beyond mundane matters that seem important, including the material, personal obsessions, insecurities, and present sensibilities.
1.12.1.2.1. Con: Most people religious or otherwise find things more important than material obsessions and insecurities. Most people find interpersonal relationships to be important and helping others and loving others to be important. The only difference in this regard between the religious and the secular is that religious people also find supernatural pursuits to be important which has not been demonstrated to be beneficial.
1.12.1.2.2. Pro: Without religion, there would be only materialism, so people believe that the material world is all that exists.
1.12.1.2.2.1. Con: That people focus their energy, effort and wishes in the world they live in, is not per se a negative thing.
1.12.1.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.7.
1.12.1.2.2.3. Con: There is nothing wrong with only believing in materialism.
1.12.1.3. Pro: Religion can give people purpose in life. It diminishes the sense of hopelessness that can arise when life has no point. It provides an absolute truth in a world where currently, most truth is relative.
1.12.1.3.1. Con: As no religion is yet proven true, it cannot be stated that they provided true information about reality, morality and salvation. If a religion is proven true in the future, then they will indeed provide incalculable benefit, but until then, that is not clear.
1.12.1.4. Pro: Religion has been a good thing for humanity not only in terms of any beneficial side-effects of religion, but also as religion qua religion, i.e. it has been a good thing for humanity to search for - and maybe find - eternal meaning and ultimate reality.
1.12.1.4.1. Con: A lot of time has been spent searching for "eternal meaning and ultimate reality", much of it without positive results, either in terms of an actual result of the search or in terms of personal enlightenment resulting from the search itself.
1.12.1.5. Pro: A religious identity - whether theistic or [scientistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism) - can provide goals to the lives of individuals and communities.
1.12.1.5.1. Con: [Goal setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_setting) is an activity that has been studied in humans and is not religious. Though religion can give extra goals people can and do make their own goals regardless.
1.12.1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.
1.12.1.6. Pro: It gives the human a sens of limit, in the prospective that there is something bigger than him, likely preventing the destruction of the world on egoistic purpose.
1.12.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.10.2.
1.12.1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.3.1.
1.12.1.7. Pro: In a seemingly meaningless world, belief in a higher order helped people give meaning to their pleasure, and hope in suffering.
1.12.1.7.1. Pro: Religion helps people understand that they have been given a gift by God, their life, which can make them value it more and not see it as a random occurrence.
1.12.1.7.1.1. Con: The theory of evolution and our [place in the tree of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution) is well established.
1.12.1.7.1.2. Con: Parents, maybe a surrogate mother, maybe some assistance from a midwife or other medical practitioners are responsible for the gift of life.
1.12.1.7.1.3. Con: There is nothing wrong with believing life to have come about by random chance. Such a belief would by definition make one lucky to be alive.
1.12.1.7.2. Con: Pleasure needs no added meaning as it is already by definition a good experience.
1.12.1.8. Con: It is personal spirituality and positive actions that gives lives purpose and meaning, not just being a part of an organised religion. Many non-religious organisations and collectives provide the same opportunity to find purpose and meaning without the rituals and control around them.
1.12.1.9. Pro: Religion is a crucial aspect of human self-expression and the search for meaning.
1.12.1.9.1. Con: Religion is quite often a group activity and often inhibits many types of self-expression.
1.12.1.9.1.1. Pro: Some [religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_perspectives_on_tattooing) ban tattoos.
1.12.1.9.1.2. Pro: Some [religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity_in_religion) restrict nudity and bodily expression.
1.12.1.9.1.3. Pro: Many [religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia#Religious_attitudes) stop the expression of sexual orientation and/or identity.
1.12.1.9.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.7.
1.12.1.9.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.1.4.2.1.1.
1.12.1.9.2. Con: Art or social media are suitable methods of self-expression, leaving religion unnecessary.
1.12.1.9.3. Pro: Religion may provide meaning through its truisms and/or common morals.
1.12.1.10. Con: Lack of purpose and meaning can lead to hedonism which, though often seen as bad by outsiders, is blissful and happy for the hedonists themselves.
1.12.1.11. Pro: Human's search for purpose in a chaotic and misunderstood universe can drive many people to madness. In that scenario, religion is a shorthand, an illusion of purpose. It has typically positive guidelines to act as a supplement to a conscience.
1.12.1.12. Con: Religion prevents people from pursing goals by promising ideal life in the afterlife.
1.12.1.12.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.9.
1.12.1.13. Pro: Most religions encourage the perspective that we are part of something bigger than ourselves.
1.12.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.10.2.2.
1.12.3. Con: Religions may hamper positive self-change. Religions teach to last and endure while going through hardships, even when the solution is to change yourself.
1.12.4. Con: Religion has restricted people in enjoying the fullness of life because of "traditions" that doesn't make any sense
1.12.5. Pro: Some humans feel the need for rituals and religion is then a useful source.
1.12.5.1. Pro: Rituals [can help](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-rituals-work/) alleviate grief and boost confidence, as well as having an effect on our psychological processes.
1.12.5.1.1. Con: While rituals may be [important](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/donna-henes/rituals_b_3294412.html) there is no particular reason to connect them to an organised religion.
1.12.5.2. Pro: Rituals can show a commitment to shared values that can [bond](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-658-10978-3_1) communities together.
1.12.5.2.1. Con: However, they're really there to show off the religion's power and to gain investment from those taking part and those wasting their time observing.
1.12.5.3. Con: -> See 1.12.5.1.1.
1.12.6. Con: Religion, like any ideology or personal philosophy, can have positive and negative effects, dependent on the individual's use of such belief far more than the beliefs themselves.
1.12.7. Con: Religion usually requires prayer, and this is the part that has shown psychological usefulness. In reducing prayer to a psychological technique of objective visualisation, you remove the need for god. This kind of prayer can work without the use of god, for example the placebo effect, or sports visualisation techniques. So these ideas show that we don't need to pray to God in order for the the techniques to work.
1.12.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.2.3.
1.12.7.2. Pro: Repeated phrases over and over is a technique called autohypnosis.
1.12.8. Pro: Religion has been a source of comfort for people in times of stress.
1.12.8.1. Con: If the stress is caused by the bad action of the person being provided comfort then it enables that action, providing temporary cover for something that can then nag at the person's conscience for the rest of their life.
1.12.9. Con: -> See 1.4.10.2.6.
1.12.10. Pro: Religion has always been a good way to socialize and to bring people together.
1.12.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.
1.12.10.2. Con: Religion can be a force for division,creating in groups and outgroups.
1.12.10.2.1. Pro: Historically, [salvery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_and_religion) has been supported by several major religions.
1.12.10.2.1.1. Con: While [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_slavery#Christian_abolitionism) supported slavery in Roman and Medieval times, many prominent religious figures advocated for its abolition in the 18th century.
1.12.10.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.1.
1.12.10.2.1.2. Con: This is a non-unique argument. Almost everyone supported, contributed, or otherwise benefited from slavery until the English [banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833) it in 1833.
1.12.10.2.1.2.1. Con: It disputes the continuous religious position, that they have they high ground.
1.12.10.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.1.
1.12.10.2.1.4. Con: Historically commerce \(greed\) supported, propagated, and grew slavery and exploitation - not religion.
1.12.10.2.1.5. Con: Judeo-Christian religions command their followers to treat their slaves fairly and with respect. Slavery was an ugly fact of life during the time, and religion helped make it less horrible.
1.12.10.2.1.5.1. Pro: [Exodus 21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+21&version=NLT) is devoted to the fair treatment of slaves.
1.12.10.2.1.5.2. Pro: [Ephesians 6:5-9](http://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/6-5.htm) commands masters and slaves to treat each other  with good will.
1.12.10.2.1.5.3. Pro: Biblical slavery is not the same as American slavery. American slavery, which followed a free-market approach to slaves was far more brutal than Biblical slavery.
1.12.10.2.1.5.3.1. Con: Even if slavery in the Bible was different chronologically and geographically, American Christian slaveholders often quoted several pro-slavery passages from the [Bible](http://time.com/5171819/christianity-slavery-book-excerpt/) to justify their practice.
1.12.10.2.1.5.3.1.1. Con: The whole practice of slavery was different in comparison to American Christian slaveholders. Slaves working under Hebrews were not murdered, beaten or abused and if they were it was taboo.
1.12.10.2.1.5.3.2. Pro: The Covenant Code dictated that if when slaves are significantly injured by their masters, manumission is to be the compensation given; the canonical examples mentioned are the knocking out of an eye or a tooth. [Exodus 21:26–27:26](http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Exodus+21:26–27:26&version=nrsv). Americans slaveowners had no such laws.
1.12.10.2.1.5.3.3. Pro: The Deuteronomic Code forbids the people of Israel from handing over fugitive slaves to their masters or oppressing them, and instructs that these fugitives should be allowed to reside where they wish.

Although a literal reading would indicate that this applies to slaves of all nationalities and locations, the Mishnah and many commentators consider the rule to have the much narrower application, to just those slaves who flee from outside Israelite territory into it.[Deuteronomic Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuteronomic_Code)
1.12.10.2.1.5.3.4. Pro: Chattel slaves were rare in the bible.
[Slavery In The Bible](https://bibleapologetics.wordpress.com/slavery-in-the-bible-25/)
1.12.10.2.1.5.4. Con: A religion supposedly preaching from divine revelation could have done away with slavery in its ranks if it truly thought slavery was bad.
1.12.10.2.1.5.4.1. Con: Opposing slavery in those times would have been impossible. Religion likely led to the decline of slavery while ensuring the well-being and fair treatment of the slaves. Had abolition been pursued outright it would have been too extreme for the times and ignored.
1.12.10.2.1.5.4.1.1. Con: [Christianity early on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#Christianity_in_the_Roman_Empire) did away with many social conventions and refused to assimilate into Roman culture. Before that the Jews often went into [rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_wars) and refused to assimilate into local culture. These two religions based on that track record could have banned slavery amongst at the very least its own ranks.
1.12.10.2.1.5.4.2. Con: [Jeremiah 34:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2034:17&version=ESV) does explicitly condemn the practice of slavery, saying, "Therefore, thus says the Lord: You have not obeyed me by proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and to his neighbor..."
1.12.10.2.1.5.4.2.1. Con: Upon reading the entire [passage](http://biblehub.com/nasb/jeremiah/34.htm) it is clear that it is only condemning the enslavement of fellow Israelites \(Hebrews\) and even then it allows them to be enslaved for a fixed amount of time as long as they are freed permanently afterwards.
1.12.10.2.1.5.5. Pro: Under Judaeo-Christian teachings, slavery becomes a contractual agreement between an employer and an employee. A rather strict contract, but the idea is no different. [Jewish](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+58%3A6-7&version=ESV) [law](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+21%3A20&version=ESV) even prohibited buying and selling  [kidnapped people](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+21%3A16&version=ESV) into slavery and [returning escaped slaves](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+23%3A15-16&version=ESV). [Christian](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+4%3A1&version=ESV) [teaching](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6%3A9&version=ESV) placed even more emphasis on the [fair treatment](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A42-45&version=ESV) of the [slaves](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A11&version=ESV).
1.12.11. Pro: Religion allows societies to feel hope and to see light in the most darkest periods.
1.12.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.3.2.
1.12.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.12.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.2.3.2.
1.12.11.4. Con: Religion has been the cause of many darkest periods of humanity.
1.12.11.4.1. Pro: Many historians refer to the Middle Ages, the period that saw the rise of Christianity after the fall of the Roman Empire, with the critical attribution of "Dark Ages".
1.12.11.4.1.1. Con: This oversimplifies and provides a warped view of a huge era of history, the [Early Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages)
1.12.11.4.1.2. Pro: During the Dark Ages the Christian faith actively obstructed scientific development.
1.12.11.4.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.8.3.
1.12.11.4.1.3. Con: The integration of Christianity in Roman's politics is only [one of many factors](https://www.history.com/news/history-lists/8-reasons-why-rome-fell). Other causes of the fall of Roman empire are: Economic troubles and over-reliance on slave labor, over-expansion and military overspending, government corruption and political instability, etc.
1.12.11.4.1.4. Con: [Many also consider the term "Dark Ages" to be deprecated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages_\(historiography\)).
1.12.11.5. Con: Religions often encourage people to endure painful situations in life in order to achieve salvation in the afterlife.
1.12.11.5.1. Con: Religion gives people a community of support when dealing with painful situations in life. Many religious participants view their congregations as hospitals for the hurting and not havens of the holy.
1.12.11.6. Pro: -> See 1.8.9.3.2.1.
1.12.11.7. Pro: Religion offers a structure to an individual’s life, helping them cope with stressful situations and helping us move forward in spite of heavy setbacks that life sometimes throws our way.
1.12.11.8. Con: Poetry and music achieve the same effect just fine.
1.12.11.9. Pro: It’s a way to guide someone in a difficult situation.
1.12.11.10. Pro: Religion gives hope and strenght to people who do not have them.
1.12.11.11. Pro: Belief in an afterlife and a benevolent higher power helps us to survive the intense grief of lost loved ones. The hope of continued existence on a higher plane and reuniting in the hereafter provides great comfort to children and adults who might otherwise be overcome with the pain of the loss.
1.12.11.11.1. Con: Alternatively if one's religion requires them to believe that a loved one is in hell because they are homosexual or an atheist or committed suicide etc. then it will make the grief infinitely worse.
1.12.11.12. Con: Many would reject the value of hope if it stems from a false premise.
1.12.11.13. Con: Religion also has terrified people into thinking they or their loved ones may suffer eternal damnation for doubting their religion.
1.12.11.13.1. Con: These people are misinformed. Many religions provide final chance for repentance. In Judaism, "hell" is not a permanent place of torture but a place of cleansing that last up to a year. In Christianity, the only unforgivable "sin" is not consenting to enter the gates of heaven. God will not force you to do what you do not want to do. So if you're loved one is in hell it's because they chose to be there. The choice will be presented to them. If you believe in that sort of thing.
1.12.11.13.1.1. Con: It is debated in [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_eschatology) whether or not non Jews get a place in "heaven".
1.12.11.13.1.2. Con: According to catholic doctrine as shown in their catechism and in the [council of trent](https://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct07.html) faith alone is not enough for salvation adhering to the churches sacraments is necessary.
1.12.11.13.1.3. Con: The [Quran](https://www.searchtruth.com/chapter_display.php?chapter=11&translator=5#17) says "They are those who have lost their ownselves, and their invented false deities will vanish from them. Certainly, they are those who will be the greatest losers in the Hereafter."
1.12.11.13.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.2.
1.12.11.14. Con: Some of the happiest and most peaceful countries are also some of the least religious. In 2012, the top 4 happiest nations, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands were also ranked as the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th least religious countries.  [psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201211/are-religious-people-happier?amp)
1.12.11.15. Pro: Faith based organizations have led or been a major part of [social change](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/people/mlk.shtml), overthrowing injustices. e.g. ending slavery, civil rights.
1.12.11.15.1. Con: -> See 1.12.10.2.1.
1.12.11.15.2. Con: In religious societies, it makes sense that people who concern themselves with the big questions in life \(which religions typically hold a monopoly over in religious societies\), are also the ones who take big steps toward overthrowing injustices. It's correlation, not causation.
1.12.12. Con: Religion allows people to accept the 'will of god' rather then make their own decisions based on common sense and personal values and ethics.
1.12.12.1. Con: Only where those decisions aren't decided by the 'will of god'.
1.12.12.1.1. Con: This suggests that anything can be justified by labelling it the will of god, and as the will of god can’t be proven, it allows free reign to do or believe whatever an individual likes, in the name of religion.
1.12.13. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.
1.12.14. Con: -> See 1.6.
1.12.15. Con: A religion is bad for the psycho social wellness of its followers if it is based on lies. God is love. To tell people that he delights in having people jabbed with pitchforks makes them think He is cruel. Very deleterious to the mental well being of those who live in fear of it.
1.12.16. Con: -> See 1.4.10.2.3.2.7.
1.12.17. Con: -> See 1.2.9.8.
1.12.18. Pro: Religion may help a lot of people with mental illness. A spiritual connection can give and build the balance, purpose/meaning and strenght that people need to pragmatize their thoughts and apathy.
1.12.19. Con: Good for the individual, worse off in the function of society as a hole.
1.12.20. Con: -> See 1.11.9.6.2.
1.12.21. Pro: Religions demonstrate meaning-making structures which allow adopters to make sense of their environment and life circumstances. They're a coping strategy.
1.12.21.1. Con: Religion is a result of the development of our cognitive trait of believing. Not the other way around.
1.12.21.2. Pro: With meditation, for example, we can become aware of something we did not previously know about.
1.12.21.2.1. Con: With science and reason one can become aware of something they did not previously know. It is easier to do this when one finds a quiet, contemplative environment.
1.12.21.2.2. Con: Some organized religions are against meditation.
1.12.21.2.2.1. Pro: The [Catholic](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19891015_meditazione-cristiana_en.html) church, for example, [claims](https://mumbailaity.wordpress.com/2013/01/23/yoga-what-the-catechism-says/) that meditation or yoga is esoteric and probably also a work of Satan even though science has proven many [benefits](https://liveanddare.com/benefits-of-meditation/) of meditation and yoga too.
1.12.21.2.2.1.1. Pro: Catholic or other Christians are correct if they claim [meditation](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19891015_meditazione-cristiana_en.html), yoga etc. are dangerous or coming from Satan, as their religion very strongly states to be "The Only Way" to [God](https://www.openbible.info/topics/god_only_way) and warns about "[false gods](https://www.openbible.info/topics/false_gods)", prophets and other religions.
1.12.22. Con: All type of belief are a way to escape from the innescapable suffering and innevitable finality that is part of life.
1.12.22.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.
1.13. Pro: Religions are useful as sources of spiritual and personal lessons.
1.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.4.
1.13.2. Con: Most religions are limited to obsolete philosophical and spiritual concepts that does not provide a modern understanding of our existence.
1.13.2.1. Pro: Monotheism was a theosophical revolution in reaction to polytheism but it may be irrelevant today to anthropomorphize what justifies our existence. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotheism)
1.13.3. Pro: It is religion which distinguishes human beings from animals, otherwise a human is not different from an animal. Both eat, sleep, mate and fear alike, but human being follows religion and inquires into the higher purpose of life.
1.13.3.1. Con: There is nothing wrong with accepting the biological fact that humans are animals. All extant animals differ from each other in certain respects and all are adapted to their own evolutionary niches. There is nothing positive about being humanocentric.
1.13.3.2. Con: Humans are indeed animals yet if they are different from other species in the animal kingdom is because, aside from eating, sleeping or mating, they are [capable](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080217102137.htm) of [higher cognition](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/humans-are-animals-too-a-whirlwind-tour-of-cognitive-biology), including rational thought and complex language, not because of religion.
1.13.3.2.1. Pro: Following the logic that religion separates humans from other animals, humans who are not religious would then behave like any other animal and that is not true:  it is cognition what makes humans capable of things different from animals.
1.13.3.3. Con: Religion can easily be seen as is a display of atavistic animal behaviors.
1.13.3.3.1. Pro: Most religions have a well defined hierarchy.
1.13.3.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.
1.13.3.3.1.2. Pro: Most organized [religions](https://www.hierarchystructure.com/islam-religious-hierarchy/) are to some [degree](https://www.hierarchystructure.com/judaism-social-hierarchy/) [hierarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_the_Catholic_Church) and dogma is indeed enforced top-down.
1.13.3.3.2. Pro: Behaviours such as mindless repetitiveness of actions that cannot remedy a particular situation and herd mentality.
1.13.3.3.2.1. Pro: There's a feeling of belonging from any reasonably welcoming group, but there's no guarantee that that achieves anything.
1.13.3.3.2.2. Pro: Catholic [confession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_\(religion\)#Christianity) and the consequential hail Mary's achieve little apart from making the "sinner" feel better about it until they need to go back to confess again.
1.13.3.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.1.4.
1.13.3.3.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.
1.13.3.3.3. Pro: Many religions place a focus on reproduction and family.
1.13.3.3.3.1. Pro: Large families spread available funds producing a tendency toward poverty, and this results in greater contributions.
1.13.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.1.
1.13.3.3.3.2. Pro: Nominally most religions claim to support family. Others attempt to redefine family as being only with others within the religion. This is generally frowned upon, leading to people describing the religion as a cult.
1.13.3.4. Con: [Animals lie](http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=1421). At the core of each religion is the process of presenting unfounded assumptions as "truth" so it is impossible to distinguish religion from lies in any meaningful manner, and thus it is impossible to distinguish us from animals through religion.
1.13.4. Con: False beliefs lead to bad decision making. At the core of most religions are false or unsubstantiated beliefs that guide the lives of adherents.
1.13.4.1. Con: Only dangerous false beliefs lead to bad decision making. Most false beliefs are benign.
1.13.4.1.1. Con: Plenty of false beliefs can be indeed harmful.
1.13.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.8.1.
1.13.4.1.1.2. Pro: Many delusional beliefs are [pathological](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810014002001).
1.13.4.1.1.3. Pro: Some false beliefs about rejecting vaccinations or medical treatments can indeed be very dangerous.
1.13.4.2. Pro: Religion is always based on made-up claims that cannot be easily changed even when proven false. Hence all religions have an intrinsic inefficiency.
1.13.4.3. Pro: There is no limit to false claims that can not be supported by "blind faith" - faith is not a reliable path to the truth.
1.13.4.4. Con: When making [major decisions](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/04/12/religion-in-everyday-life/) there are not stark differences between the highly religious \(hereafter referred to as "the former"\) and the not highly religious: 80% of the former and 83% of the latter rely “a lot” on their own research. 49% of the former and 42% of the latter rely on family advice. 22% of the former and 26% of the latter rely on expert advice.
1.13.4.4.1. Con: Unlike non-religious people, 86% of religious people rely "a lot" on prayer and religious reflection to [make decisions](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/04/12/religion-in-everyday-life/) and 33% seek advice from religious leaders.
1.13.5. Pro: Religion is a system to keep society managed and under one umbrella. Absence of anything can be filled by religion. Like, if one is feeling low, hope is religion. If one is about to commit a sin, his fear to not do that is religion.
1.13.5.1. Con: A [study](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1069397111402465) has suggested that as our control over our environment increases in economically advanced countries belief in religion will go down. This implies that what religion fills in people's lives can be filled by many other things.
1.13.6. Pro: Religion provides moral and psychological support.
1.13.6.1. Con: Virtues, like morality, are gained through education.
1.13.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.6.
1.13.6.2. Con: Psychological support should be provided by [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology), a science that is based on knowledge, whereas religion is based on blind belief.
1.13.7. Con: Faith might be useful as sources of spiritual and personal lessons. Unfortunately, religion is not faith and has been created to manipulate and control "the flock".
1.13.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.13.8. Con: Religion is not the only way to lift your spiritual way.
1.13.9. Con: Religious dogma often contains contradictory and ambiguous lessons. The ambiguity allows for people to commit inhumane acts under the guise of a particular scriptural interpretation.
1.13.9.1. Con: These inhumane acts are relatively uncommon. The vast majority of human actions influenced by religions are not and have not been harmful. Rather, they have been positive or relatively neutral in terms of affecting others.
1.13.9.1.1. Con: Many human actions inspired by religion have propelled conflict among humans and the persecution of those "othered", so they have not been neutral in affecting others.
1.13.9.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.1.1.
1.13.9.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.
1.13.10. Con: Religion consists of followers and leaders and religious teachings can be influenced by the leaders' own agendas. As seen trough history, leaders' agendas, one way or another, can become part of a religion's core.
1.13.10.1. Pro: When people hate one another, religious books are often used to justify that hatred, as if it was predestined by a deity.
1.13.11. Con: Religion is not required for the personal lessons to be taught. They could be taught through other, secular sources.
1.13.11.1. Pro: You can inquire and study the higher purpose of life without religion, which often restricts the answers to predestined writings.
1.13.11.2. Pro: Religion studies the nature of sin and applies these lessons to humanity. Absence of religion encourages the study of life
1.13.11.3. Pro: Respect for Life and Nature can be taught without the negative messages about Life and Nature that come with religious dogma.
1.13.12. Pro: The absence of religion has led people to seek solace in consumer culture rather than spirituality.
1.13.12.1. Con: Some people in the absence of religion take solace in those they love or in their work.
1.13.12.2. Con: If consumer culture makes someone happy and fulfilled it should not be considered a bad thing in that instance.
1.13.13. Pro: If a particular religion is true, that religion would provide incalculable benefit to society by conveying true information to people about transcendent reality, morality, and salvation.
1.13.13.1. Con: Religion resides to the limit of what we know therefore, can't never really be true. Believing is the basis of religion. Wikipedia says : Belief is the state of mind in which a person thinks something to be the case with or without there being empirical evidence to prove that something is the case with factual certainty. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief)
1.13.13.2. Con: -> See 1.12.1.3.1.
1.13.13.3. Pro: In fact they all might be true to some degree, and in that lead people to better understanding of the transcendent.
1.13.14. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.3.
1.13.15. Pro: Religion teaches respect for nature and life.
1.13.15.1. Con: Religion typically holds man outside and above of the natural order which leads to less respect for nature and life.
1.13.15.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.3.
1.13.16. Con: Faith gives people an opportunity to replace common sense and reasoning with an unquestionable authority of their own choosing.
1.13.17. Con: Religions are not a reliable source of spiritual and personal lessons.
1.13.17.1. Pro: There are simply too many faiths and denominations in the world to even have a comparative discussion. The multiple divisions that exist prove that religion is neither unified nor reliable.
1.13.17.2. Pro: There are too many religious dogmas—there is no reason to believe one over the other suggesting they are all man-made and bogus.
1.13.18. Con: -> See 1.1.17.
1.13.19. Con: Religious dogma can block exploration of personal spiritual development
1.13.19.1. Con: A dogma is only a marker for what constitutes a necessary belief in any given system. You can't be a christian who don't believe that Jesus is the son of God, because believing that is what constitutes being a christian. Likewise you can't be an atheist who believes in God, because not believing in God is the sole criterion for being an atheist. Dogma does not block spiritual development, it merely categorises it.
1.13.19.2. Con: Religion can be viewed as a shared and negotiated spirituality.
1.13.19.2.1. Pro: Much like language: [creole languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language), stable natural languages developed from a mixture of different languages to become a native language, are negotiated.
1.13.19.2.1.1. Con: An analogy is not a correct way of logical inference.
1.13.19.2.2. Con: "[Religion](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/68747/the-etymology-of-religion-comes-from-legere-meaning-to-read-re-meaning-a)" comes from Latin and suggests a commitment, either written or spoken, to a group or cannon, that would be binding and to that extent non-negotiable.
1.13.19.2.3. Pro: Much like science is a negotiated understanding of how things are, a religion can be viewed as a negotiated understanding of how we should act in the world.
1.13.19.2.3.1. Con: Religion teaches us how we should act in the world if we want to go to heaven. Given that "going to heaven" is a meditative process one can't engage when dead, it is an uncertain reward.
1.13.19.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.21.3.
1.13.19.2.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.1.2.
1.13.19.2.3.2. Con: It is not a fair comparison. The scientific method is totally different from how religion has come to be. The idea of a "negotiated understanding of how we should act" is an idealization of how religion spawned.
1.13.19.2.3.3. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.13.19.2.3.4. Con: Science is proven or disproven using logic and empyrical evidence. You cannot negotiate facts.
1.13.19.2.3.4.1. Pro: The scientific method is epecifically designed, so that human influence is minimized.
1.13.19.2.4. Con: [The Gospel of Thomas](http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/gthlamb.html), logion 114, shows that mithraic christianity has been gender politics, for the most part, for the last 2000 years.
1.13.19.2.5. Con: Religions are originally dictated by their god\(s\) through the religious books. The word of God is not negotiable
1.13.19.2.5.1. Con: Gods are human creations that represents archetypes and role models which survived multiple generations through storytelling.
1.13.19.2.5.1.1. Con: Even if we were to assume that gods were only human creations, the words of the religious books exists and their commandments are empowered by the religious entities.
1.13.19.2.5.1.2. Con: There is no irrefutable evidence that God or gods are merely human creation. The limits of the current technology and the constancy of change of human understanding of reality is not capable of supporting generalized statement pertaining to the existence or non-existence of God.
1.13.19.2.5.2. Pro: Younger generations do not feel like they are part of the negotiation, because most religions were settled before they were born.
1.13.19.2.5.3. Pro: Many people believe that God actually exist, and decide to follow the religious dogma without negotiation.
1.13.19.2.5.4. Con: Religious texts are a meditative experience of heaven originally experienced by a prophet or messiah and then interpreted and articulated by them, including human failings: in that sense, the Word is negotiable
1.13.19.2.5.4.1. Pro: For example, in Judaism, the ‘[Midrash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash#Forms_of_Midrashic_literature)’ is a type of rabbinic literature in which rabbis interpret and comment the Torah and other religious laws. The purpose of this is to resolve problems and find a common understanding, therefore showing a negotiation process.
1.13.19.2.5.4.1.1. Pro: [Contemporary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash#Forms_of_Midrashic_literature) forms of 'midrash' include literature and artwork to facilitate the interpretation of sacred texts. According to some scholars 'midrash' can also be used to “update” or “enhance” sacred texts, thus being a form of rewriting them in a way that  makes them "more acceptable to later ethical standards" and renders what is less obviously implausible.
1.13.19.2.5.4.2. Con: The texts are considered to be the Word of God \(to the prophet/author\) by the followers of the religion, therefore, they are not negotiable.
1.13.19.2.6. Con: Even leaders of many religions will tell you that what people get from their religion will vary from person to person. Thus viewing religion as a shared spirituality is an inaccurate perception.
1.13.19.3. Pro: There are virtually an infinity of ways for spiritual development \(each person can have his own\). When following one specific dogma, you can't explore the other ways and can't decide by your own experience which one is best for you.
1.13.19.3.1. Con: An infinite number of ways is more ways than a person has time to explore in a lifetime, religion narrows the field to a smaller subset of infinite ways, which are still more ways than a person can explore in their life.
1.13.19.3.2. Con: The point of religion is to show and teach people the "correct" way \(whatever each religion feels the correct way is\). Allowing individualism runs counter to this, as it is by definition, not the "correct" way.
1.13.19.3.2.1. Con: Religion and individualism are not mutually exclusive
1.13.19.3.2.2. Pro: Thousand of years of developing a particular theory will most of the time have more wisdom and useful knowledge than what a single individual can produce.
1.13.19.3.3. Pro: Spiritual development is never a collective task. The collective task should be supporting the spiritual development of its members. Religion is actually a tool to sanction spiritual development as it establishes its boundaries.
1.13.19.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.1.5.
1.13.19.5. Pro: -> See 1.12.21.2.2.1.
1.13.19.6. Con: Religious dogma can be used as structure for building a stable and fulfilled life. There is nothing that says dogma is necessarily enforced top-down.
1.13.19.6.1. Con: -> See 1.13.3.3.1.2.
1.13.20. Pro: [Buddhist](https://www.thoughtco.com/buddhism-and-compassion-449719) and [Abrahamic](http://www.questionsaboutislam.com/faith-beliefs-practices/islam-teaches-manners.php) ethics have made some people kinder towards their fellow man than they would otherwise be required to be.

1.13.20.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.2.5.4.
1.13.20.5. Pro: -> See 1.12.10.2.1.5.
1.13.21. Pro: Spirituality is a part of who we are as humans, and shared spirituality with common understanding \(religion\) is the way it gets expressed in community.
1.13.21.1. Con: Spirituality in its traditional meaning is religious - belief in the supernatural and/or unprovable - and this is not 'part of who we are' for all humans. It is not required to have this to be a human.
1.13.21.2. Con: 'Shared spirituality with common meaning' is not the only definition of religion. Modern meanings of 'spirituality' include references to human emotion and wonder at the universe. These things are not supernatural, and therefore not religious in nature, meaning spirituality is not necessarily religious.
1.13.21.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.19.2.
1.13.22. Con: Religion suggests there is a smarter being that is taking care of our world and us, so it reduces our sense of responsibility for our actions.
1.13.22.1. Con: In monotheistic religions, the intent of the deity is primarily benevolent. It is well known to those who practice these religions that what happens on this planet is indeed important, and that we are [capable](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/09/free_will_debate_what_does_free_will_mean_and_how_did_it_evolve.html) and [responsible](https://www.gotquestions.org/personal-responsibility.html) creatures.
1.13.22.2. Pro: Many religions believe god has a plan for everyone which would indeed take responsibility away from people. It is common to hear people say that x was God's will or if x was meant to be it will be. Such attitudes suggest that fate and God will take care of things and that humans do not have to.
1.13.22.2.1. Pro: Many religions express a sense of [fatalism](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/standingonmyhead/religion-and-responsibility) in which humans' destinies are almost predetermined \(and dependent on Karma, God's plan, etc.\)
1.13.22.2.2. Pro: Some branches of Christianity do in fact believe god has a plan for each individual. [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism) for example believes in predestination.
1.13.22.3. Pro: The [diffusion of responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility), a psychological phenomenon in which people are less likely to take action, may affect the sense of responsability of those belonging to religious groups as they may feel someome else \(God\) will take care of situations.
1.13.22.4. Con: Some religions, like Christianity, endorse [personal responsability](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/standingonmyhead/religion-and-responsibility) and claim that people's acts in life determine their future in the afterlife.
1.13.22.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.3.
1.13.22.4.2. Con: -> See 1.13.22.2.1.
1.13.22.5. Con: To establish responsible behaviors, it is possible to observe that in terms of healthy habits, social conscience or at making major life decisions, religious and non-religious, according to research, do not present great [differences](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/04/12/religion-in-everyday-life/).
1.13.22.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.4.4.
1.13.22.6. Pro: Religion has been used to justify behavior.  It can take the form of not taking responsibility and passing it off to some other facit \(teachings, God\).
1.13.23. Con: That assumes that spiritual and personal "lessons" are "positive" and not just people who mistakenly believe that they've had some form of enlightenment.
1.13.24. Pro: Some religion teaches self control and discipline without which we would not be able to make a good society.
1.13.24.1. Con: Self control and discipline can be taught through secular methods, therefore religion is not required to teach these things.
1.13.24.2. Con: However much religion teaches these things, it also carries other teachings that have negative effects, therefore religion is not the best method of teaching them.
1.14. Con: Religiosity is a sign of societies' failure: the least religious societies tend to be the most successful.
1.14.1. Pro: Japan, China, Singapore and South Korea are all well-developed countries, [socially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index#Asia) and [economically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Asian_countries_by_GDP), in comparison to their more religious [neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_atheism#Asia).
1.14.1.1. Con: China starving [45 million citizens](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html) to death is not a successful society nor an example of development.
1.14.1.2. Con: [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_South_Korea) is comparably more religious than [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_North_Korea) and yet more developed.
1.14.1.2.1. Con: Japan, and South Korea are successful because they adopted capitalism which stems from western civilization which has its source in [Christianity](https://acton.org/pub/religion-liberty/volume-10-number-3/how-christianity-created-capitalism).
1.14.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.11.8.12.3.
1.14.1.3. Pro: Among [Asian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_atheism#Asia) regions, [nominal GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Asia) is higher in more [secular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_irreligion) China, Japan and South Korea.
1.14.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.14.1.2.1.
1.14.1.3.2. Con: Until China adopted [limited capitalism](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-china-went-from-communist-to-capitalist-2015-10) in the 1970's, which originated in [western civilization](https://acton.org/pub/religion-liberty/volume-10-number-3/how-christianity-created-capitalism), and has [christian origins](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Role_of_Christianity_in_civilization), the vast majority of the population lived in abject [poverty](https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/aug/19/china-poverty-inequality-development-goals).
1.14.2. Con: There are many definitions of what is to be Religious and what to be Successful. Successful can be seen as rich or can be seen as empathic. Religious can be seen as idealistic or as a way to look deeper into the invisible part of each other, to help each other on a deeper level.
1.14.2.1. Pro: The measure of success of religious practice for the practitioner is often the will to strive towards becoming a better person as well as the ability to truly recognize the humanity of others. This is in contrast to secular measures of success, such as getting rich, being the best at something or having created a lasting legacy.
1.14.2.2. Con: There are empirical [measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index) to define a country as successful based on life expectancy, scholarization and income per capita. "Successful" does not mean to be rich but to enjoy basic [Humans Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) and to have enough income to live without severe deprivations.
1.14.3. Con: -> See 1.11.9.6.2.3.
1.14.4. Con: Throughout history there have been many cases of the opposite being true. Religiosity has also been a sign of societies' success.
1.14.4.1. Con: Success may be relative. Sparta, the most religious of the Classical Greek states, was able to defeat Athens in the [Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War) and become a hegemonic power, but culturally remained a backwater of the Greek civilization.
1.14.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.
1.14.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.9.2.1.10.
1.14.5. Con: Success is a subjective concept. One can not correlate "religiosity and failure" or "lack of religion with success" when the concluded terms themselves have no true meaning.
1.14.5.1. Con: -> See 1.14.2.2.
1.14.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.2.1.

1.14.12. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.3.5.1.1.
1.14.13. Con: There are examples of unsuccessful secular societies that produced large scale atrocities.
1.14.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.
1.14.13.2. Con: That some secular societies fail does't imply that the religious don't do it on an even larger scale.
1.14.13.3. Pro: Authoritarian government such as the China, which has no state religion, have persecuted their ethnic minorities such as the [Tibetan peoples,](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/ruthless-campaign-of-cultural-destruction-796273.html) and the [Muslims living in Xinjiang province](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/10/asia/xinjiang-china-reeducation-camps-intl/index.html). Another example is the Soviet Union, which starved Ukranians in the Holodomor, leading to the death of up to 10 million.
1.14.13.3.1. Con: All forms of Authoritarianism are bad for people's freedom, which causes protest. But religion is the only one that hangs around.
1.14.14. Con: -> See 1.11.9.
1.15. Con: Religion may have been useful in the past but is no longer of value; the harm done now outweighs the usefulness of the past.
1.15.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.2.3.2.4.
1.15.2. Pro: In Religion, Civility and humanity takes the back seat as preaching and practices take precedence and often these practices are not up-to-date.
1.15.3. Pro: Religion was an is a kind of social control but it teach us the power of the Faith. Is now time for science and philosophy to free this power for the people without old and useless authorities.
1.15.4. Pro: Religion promotes the adherence to outdated ideologies that exclude people based on societal norms that no longer apply.
1.15.4.1. Pro: Religions don't move with the times and dont adapt, keeping people anchored to archaic views, which will often go unchallenged
1.15.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.3.1.
1.15.5. Con: If religion were not a good thing for humankind, we would've abandoned it a long time ago.
1.15.5.1. Con: This confers humankind a perfect form of decision making in which only what is good is preserved.
1.15.5.1.1. Pro: Discrimination, tribalism, tobacco, alcohol, drugs, authoritarianism or a lack of care for the environment, among other issues, may not be good for humankind, and yet they still exist.
1.15.5.1.2. Pro: Scientific method and thinking proved itself to make highly positive impact on the society, yet was abandoned first by Roman and then by Islamic civilizations.
1.15.5.2. Con: Religion is a philosophical attempt at escape from the [absurd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism). It's a compulsive [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit), analogous to [nail biting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_biting) and humans don't change rapidly or easily, that's why religions still exists.
1.15.5.2.1. Pro: Kierkegaard's [Leap of Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_of_faith) is the epistemological inability to grapple with the very nature of Existence, the paradoxes of [death](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/03/25/the-mortality-paradox/) and the [Real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality).
1.15.5.2.2. Pro: Nail biting is a good example in this context as is compulsive although note that is moreover a biological urge stemming from the times before humans had tools to pare nails.
1.15.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.
1.15.5.4. Con: The people in power of the cults won't leave their high standing positions.
1.15.5.5. Con: Religion may be hard-wired in our brains, that's why it is so hard to abandon it. It's like - "If too much food were not a good thing for humankind, we would've abandoned it a long time ago".
1.15.5.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.14.
1.15.5.5.2. Con: Even if religion is hardwired into our brains it is still possible to abandon it as the numerous atheists and religious nones of the world have done. As such it is unlike food in that we do not need it to survive.
1.15.5.6. Con: Abandoning Religion goes against Religious teachings.
1.15.5.7. Con: People are starting to abandon religion.
1.15.5.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.2.
1.15.5.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.3.
1.15.5.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.4.
1.15.6. Pro: Science and philosophy, in many cases, have catered to people's search for meaning and understanding. Nowadays, when faced with the cumulative theories and calculations of centuries of scientists and philosophers, religion can often appear antiquated. Its messages, once radical and mind-expanding, have been overtaken, and to keep preaching them might actually be detrimental to the modern mindset
1.15.7. Pro: Religion was a good thing for humankind when we had neither philosophy nor science and religion exercised the imagination and created culture and folkloric bases. Now, after the achievement of science and logic, religion has massively contributed to the disbelief of these ways of reaching knowledge and religion continues to control cultures.
1.15.7.1. Con: Science didn't start at some point after the rise of religion. It started when someone first used a branch as a lever, noticed there were seasons or that wood floats or… Science comes from common sense. Even the first time someone persuaded a bunch of people there was a "god" that governed the seasons they were already interfering with science.
1.15.7.1.1. Pro: The damage done by religion in the early days was probably at least as significant as the damage it does now, and as in those days [scientists were killed](https://www.quora.com/Witchcraft-historical-Were-witches-really-healers-and-herbalists-and-midwives) rather than science disputed, it was probably far more severe, literally keeping us in the Stone Age.
1.15.8. Pro: If the benefits that religion provides can be now outsourced by other means \(state, welfare, legal system, etc.\) that are not paired with the negatives of religion, it may have been good and yet it no longer is.
1.15.9. Pro: Arguably, religion "was" a good thing for humankind in times of ignorance... but its importance in today's society needs to be phased out. At present, we need to operate on facts and evidence, and not on past beliefs rooted in ignorance.
1.15.10. Con: Lessons from religion are also used in marketing so that businesses can fair better on the battlefield of commerce. 
Storytelling is one of  the core techniques when doing anything religious like bible lessons, wisdom sharing and ceremony alike, storytelling also happens to be one of the basic techniques in marketing business to business and in business to client communication.
1.15.10.1. Con: There are far better methods for learning modern marketing techniques than religion. Scientific understanding of human psychology being one of them.
1.15.10.2. Con: The skills of storytelling and wisdom sharing are not limited to religion, therefore religion is not required to teach these things.
1.16. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.
1.17. Con: Religions have slowed down the human advancement in science and technology.
1.17.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.
1.17.2. Con: Other social forces have been more influential in preventing progress than religion.
1.17.2.1. Pro: Science was [actively repressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressed_research_in_the_Soviet_Union) in the USSR.
1.17.2.2. Pro: The US Government [suppressed research](http://ncac.org/resource/redacting-the-science-of-climate-change/) into climate change, likely due to ideological and political forces.
1.17.2.3. Con: Two wrongs don't make a right.
1.17.2.4. Con: While certain other forces may have, at specific times and in specific locations, prevented progress more than religion, over time religion has, largely without interruption, been preventing progress continuously all over the world. Short lived social forces preventing progress pails in comparison to the thousands of years of antiscience rhetoric.
1.17.3. Pro: Religious dogma \(an idea that becomes unquestionably true\) is harmful to human development.
1.17.3.1. Pro: Government has historically been intertwined with inflexible religious scripture
1.17.3.2. Pro: Historically, a great deal of taxation was collected by religions and spent on elaborate structures, rather than infrastructure, welfare or science.
1.17.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.19.
1.17.3.4. Pro: Religiously motivated marriage significantly impacts personal relationships
1.17.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.12.10.2.
1.17.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.11.9.2.1.
1.17.3.7. Con: Initially, while still developing, religions have caused rapid societal advances
1.17.3.7.1. Con: The period of development for many religions was much shorter than the period of dogma.
1.17.3.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.14.4.
1.17.3.8. Con: Dogma is not only present in religion.
1.17.3.8.1. Con: While dogma may be present in other belief systems \(social, political, humanistic…\), religion is the only one that claims that its dogmas come from a revealed truth from a higher or superior being. While any other dogmas are man-made and thus subject to questioning, religion ones are not.
1.17.3.8.2. Pro: Dogma appears as much outside of religion as it does within. Most instutions will adopt maladaptive dogmas. It is not a facet distinct of religion, but a product of [human Psychology](http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Dogmatism) which will be brought into all aspects of life.
1.17.3.8.2.1. Con: What phycology describes is a personality trait “characterized by oversimplified thinking, resistance to changing attitudes or beliefs, and appealing to authority to justify their beliefs”. The issue lies in authority: if that authority is human, it can and will be questioned, if that authority is divine, questioning is not an option.
1.17.3.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1.13.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.3.
1.17.4. Con: -> See 1.2.10.
1.17.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.1.
1.17.6. Pro: And vice versa, a loosening of religious control and dogma often increased the pace of scientific, technological and even ethical progress.
1.17.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.4.
1.17.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.1.9.
1.17.9. Pro: -> See 1.11.9.2.1.
1.17.10. Con: -> See 1.11.9.2.1.10.
1.17.11. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.1.
1.17.12. Con: -> See 1.11.3.3.
1.17.13. Con: Advancing fast is not necessarily a good thing, for instance, religion has stimulated debate about the ethics of science and so made science better.
1.17.13.1. Con: Freedom and critical thinking stimulate debate about ethics, science, personal opinion, lifetyle, etc.  This debate would not have been possible in previous centuries.
1.17.13.1.1. Pro: Laws against blasphemy still existed in 25% of the world [as of 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law). Some of this discussion would, no doubt, fall under those laws. If one religious person in one of those countries is or becomes a moderator we could wake up tomorrow with substantial censorship to our free speech here, and the same applies on any other moderated forum or social media that is visible in any of those countries.
1.17.13.2. Con: This ethical debate does not necessarily make science better. It only makes it better from the subjective viewpoint of the religious people who oppose certain advancements.
1.17.13.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.1.4.2.4.
1.17.13.2.2. Con: Debate is always a good thing for science, because it leads to analyzing things deeper. Ethical debate, for instance, adds a "forecasting" component to scientific researches.
1.17.13.2.2.1. Con: When ethical debates are on one side entirely faith based rather than evidence based they do nothing but hamper progress.
1.17.13.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.1.4.2.4.
1.18. Con: Organized religions discourage personal exploration and spirituality.
1.18.1. Pro: The politics of religion have obscured and diminished the development of collective and personal spirituality.
1.18.1.1. Pro: Schisms in Christianity are examples of politics over "theological differences" because the fundamental spiritual aspects in Christianity are forgiveness and acceptance.  Examples of schism in Christianity are [many](https://www.google.ca/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=schisms+in+chrisianity&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&gfe_rd=cr&dcr=0&ei=tnx7WseMC8Xe8AfQsLW4CA).
1.18.1.1.1. Pro: These power struggles between high hierarchical figures divide believers and split the faith.
1.18.1.2. Con: -> See 1.13.19.2.
1.18.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.19.
1.18.1.4. Pro: Religion has killed the faith. God and Satan are from within a person. All her/his good traits are God and bad ones are Satan. But religions have taken this fact out by personifying God and Satan it has taken the introspective improvement out of the mankind.
1.18.1.4.1. Con: But by externalising these values and behaviours to archetypal deities, not only they were in a better place to debate about them and come to consensus, but they made these ideals memorable and easily transmittable through stories, myths and folklore.
1.18.2. Pro: In order to spread religion among the masses, organized religion has reduced subtle human pursuits such as "introspection" and "spirituality" into ritualistic activities to be performed mechanically, and sometimes performed purely to avoid committing "sin".
1.18.2.1. Pro: Praying to a god is by definition not introspection. It's either referring to an outside being or to just a part of oneself, depending on your religion.
1.18.2.1.1. Con: Referring to a part of oneself is the same as introspection.
1.18.2.2. Pro: Delaying introspection until particular times of day can't be good for the process. The impact of earlier occurrences will have dulled.
1.18.2.3. Pro: Repeating the same mantras can't be a good start for true introspection.
1.18.2.3.1. Con: Mantras are used as a focus tool for introspection. They are used to negate extroversive noise and allow for "true introspection."
1.18.2.4. Con: Prayer, mantras, meditation, etc... are used to inspire positive action as much as they may be to avoid negative action \(sin\).
1.18.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.6.1.1.2.2.1.
1.18.2.5. Con: Introspection being mechanical shouldn't actually be possible. Some religions may make spiritual pursuits ritualistic, but not all do, and few originally intended to. The Christian faith, for example, was initially intended as a vibrant personal relationship.
1.18.2.5.1. Con: It's inferred that it's the attempt that is mechanical and that a positive result is less likely when that is the case, not only because the attempt is by rote, but because the religion may be a distraction rather than an aid.
1.18.2.6. Con: The power of ritual should not be discounted.
1.18.3. Pro: We need to distinguish between a spiritual belief \(a mythology\) and a religion. There is nothing wrong with having a spiritual belief. All religions are actually nothing more than the business organisation and exploitation of people with spiritual beliefs. Therefore religion has never been a good thing for humanity.
1.18.4. Pro: Religion often promotes triviality at the expense of common ground.  People demonize denominations of the same basic faith and argue over relatively meaningless differences, such as when a Prophet arrived or what foods God has sanctioned.  Spirituality focuses on the present while religion focuses on trivial and \(many would agree\) unproven tales within scriptures.
1.18.5. Con: Personal exploration does not come from a group.
1.18.6. Con: Organized religion can guide you on the path of spirituality. It creates the space \(e.g. church\), the resources \(e.g. theology\) and the time \(e.g. prayer, confession\) to exercise and explore your spirituality.
1.18.6.1. Con: Organized religion also restricts your ability to think outside of the dogma imposed by that religion.
1.18.6.2. Con: Setting oneself on the path of spirituality is not necessarily something positive.
1.18.7. Pro: Spirituality is the root, the undefined source of what humanity forms Religion out of.  Religion is a creation of humanity implementing rules and structure, derived out of the understanding of a few, on the masses; therefore denying personal understanding of faith and spirituality.
1.18.8. Con: Religion has become a link to spirituality. Some without it will never experience that dimension.
1.18.8.1. Con: Spirituality is unnecessary.
1.18.8.2. Con: Spirituality is not a well defined concept. What a religious person considers spiritual may well be no different from the awe and wonder an atheist might experience.
1.18.8.2.1. Con: Except that for a religious person awe and wonder could be all in his or her head, while the atheist may find it in real things, like a tree or particle physics.
1.18.9. Con: Many organized religions [encourage the adepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality) to seek for spirituality.
1.18.9.1. Con: Organized religion limits spirituality to their own version: There is no seeking for it, just reading and listening until the reader/audience conflates the moral tales and truisms with the "facts" and the tenets.
1.18.9.1.1. Con: Many people became adepts of organized religions after long seeking for true spirituality and after trying different spiritual practices.
1.18.9.1.1.1. Con: Maybe having a written guide just makes it easier to settle for it, but spirituality and a written guide seem incompatible.
1.18.9.1.1.1.1. Con: Finding a way with a map leads to the same goal as finding a way without a map. Seeking for a way without a map is more likely to take much time and not bring to the goal.
1.18.9.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There's not necessarily one destination for everyone. If there's one destination for each of us then a map is useless.
1.18.9.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Doctrines of organized religions do not necessarily require uniformity of the spiritual paths.
1.18.9.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Even if there is such a thing as destination \(which is not granted\), and even if it is different for everyone, it is still useful to have an idea how to reach the closest point in a more optimal way.
1.18.9.1.1.1.2. Con: Even if organized religions were limiting space for spirituality seeking, since the very term "spirituality" is poorly defined and arguably misguiding, with questionable benefits, this limitation is not necessarily something bad.
1.18.9.1.2. Con: Many adherents of organized religions will argue that their practices allow achieving a higher level of spirituality: [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starets), [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism).
