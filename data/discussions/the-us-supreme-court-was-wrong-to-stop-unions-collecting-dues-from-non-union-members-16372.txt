Discussion Title: The US Supreme Court was wrong to stop unions collecting dues from non-union members

1. The US Supreme Court was wrong to stop unions collecting dues from non-union members.
1.1. Con: Not all employees may feel represented by a particular union. Collective bargaining must be voluntary.
1.2. Pro: The Reagan administration kneecapped unions and this is just the next blow in that trend.
1.3. Pro: Thousands of union contracts will have to be renegotiated and unions will lose funding.
1.4. Pro: Only benefits the 1%
1.4.1. Pro: There is everything wrong with primarily benefiting the 1%. Justice is indeed blind when the silencing of large groups of workers are made legal. Silence has no benefit for any group.
1.4.2. Con: It also benefits those who won't have to pay dues.
1.4.3. Con: There's nothing wrong with benefiting the 1%
1.4.3.1. Con: Inequality is the [biggest threat to the world](http://Inequality is the biggest threat to the world and needs to be tackled now) and needs to be tackled as soon as possible.
1.4.4. Con: Justice is blind, including just decisions that benefit the people who are already winners in our society.
1.5. Con: They made the right decision because it's not fair to collect money from non-members.
1.5.1. Pro: If a worker feels like they lack bargaining skills and leverage, yet deserve greater compensation; a union may be the answer. An employee’s work is only worth a certain amount to the employer though. If a union becomes too powerful an employer may need to cut employees and either invest in capital or simply sell services at a higher price in order to prevent losses. These are all also negative outcomes for labour.
1.5.2. Con: But everyone benefited from the work of the unions, even non-members.
