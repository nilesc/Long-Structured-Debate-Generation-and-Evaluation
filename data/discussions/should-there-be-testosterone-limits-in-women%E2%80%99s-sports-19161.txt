Discussion Title: Should there be testosterone limits in women’s sports?

1. There should be testosterone limits in women’s sports.
1.1. Pro: Allowing women with high testosterone levels to compete in certain sports threatens the safety of other sportswomen.
1.1.1. Con: Only small numbers of female athletes don't meet these limits, and only a subset of sports allow direct contact between athletes, so it's not clear if there is any meaningful change in safety.
1.1.2. Con: Participation in all sports is voluntary and risks are known.
1.1.3. Pro: Women who are stronger are more likely to injure other competitors in contact sports.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Testosterone increases [muscle mass](https://www.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jappl.1989.66.1.498?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&#).
1.1.3.2. Con: Many sports, such as gymnastics, swimming, and tennis, to name but a few, are non-contact, meaning that stronger participants do not put other participants in any danger.
1.1.4. Pro: Knowing that they will have to compete with women who have a significant advantage over them might push athletes to train too much, which can lead to injury.
1.1.5. Pro: The knowledge that they will never beat a competitor like [Caster Semenya](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/lynsey-sharp-caster-semenya-rio-2016-olympics) can damage athlete's mental health.
1.1.6. Con: Sports where injury caused by another athlete, especially contact sports, are already divided by [weight class](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class) for participants’ safety.
1.1.6.1. Con: There are no weight classes in women's [rugby union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rugby_union).
1.2. Con: Other biological variations among athletes are not artificially or medically diminished.
1.2.1. Pro: There are [countless reports](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2013/09/05/do-genetic-advantages-make-sports-unfair/) of the genetics of athletic excellence. Many athletes respond more effectively to training. For some, the shape of their bodies is optimized for certain kinds of athletic activities. Many of them have an unfair advantage as they carry genes that put them far ahead of ordinary athletes. Hence many sports inherently often favor people with certain genetic gifts and higher testosterone levels should not be treated differently.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Basketball does not have a height limit. Intuitively, athletes who are extremely tall have a significant advantage. Naturally, it would be unfair to ban these people from playing. The same should then apply to female athletes with high testosterone levels.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Competitors also vary in implicit characteristics such as lung capacity, recovery rates and even hormone levels. This variability is generally accepted as a [standard part of the sporting culture](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/12/health/testosterone-and-hyperandrogenism-in-female-athletes/index.html), hence it is wrong to not apply the same standard to testosterone levels.
1.3. Pro: Women with high levels of testosterone have an unfair advantage in women’s sport.
1.3.1. Con: If eradicating unfair advantages was an actual goal in sports, competitors would be matched according to a more holistic look at their physical condition and genetic predispositions. Using testosterone as a single measurement is reductive.
1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.3.2. Pro: High levels of testosterone allow female athletes to [train](https://www.health24.com/Lifestyle/Woman/Your-body/12-testosterone-facts-20130403) longer and harder than their low-testosterone rivals.
1.3.3. Pro: Women with high levels of testosterone have high levels of [haemoglobin](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/04/27/female-athletes-with-naturally-high-testosterone-levels-face-hurdles-under-new-iaaf-rules/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.0d32582a0c4f), which transports oxygen to red blood cells, thus enhancing athletic performance.
1.3.4. Pro: Female athletes competing against other women with very high testosterone limits have often [complained](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/08/25/athletics.semenya.commonwealth.games/) regarding how unfair they feel the system is.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Cummins, with regards to her competitor Semenya, has [stated](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/08/25/athletics.semenya.commonwealth.games/) that, "even if she is a female, she's on the very fringe of the normal athlete female biological composition from what I understand of hormone testing. So, from that perspective, most of us just feel that we are literally running against a man."
1.3.4.2. Con: More than 60 elite female athletes have [voiced](https://thinkprogress.org/semenya-letter-solidarity-e0fb77a2b8d2/) their support for Caster Semenya, showing that many within the community affirm her right to compete.
1.3.4.3. Con: Feeling like a system is unfair and it actually being unfair are not necessarily the same thing.
1.3.5. Pro: Female athletes with high levels of testosterone have a competitive advantage through their improved [visuospatial abilities](https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/naturally-produced-testosterone-gives-female-athletes-significant-competitive-edge/).
1.3.6. Con: By trying to weed out extraordinary sportswomen to cater for the majority, the sporting community could lose extremely talented, once-in-a-generation athletes.
1.3.7. Con: There is not conclusive evidence that this is the case \([Huang](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28711608)\).
1.3.7.1. Pro: In July 2015, the Court of Arbitration for Sport found that, in a case involving [Dutee Chand](https://theconversation.com/so-what-if-some-female-olympians-have-high-testosterone-62935) and the International Association for Athletic Federations, it was "unable to conclude that hyperandrogynic female athletes may benefit from such a significant performance advantage that it is unnecessary to exclude them from competing in the female category." \([CAS](http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Media_Release_3759_FINAL.pdf)\)
1.3.7.1.1. Pro: Since it is inconclusive that additional testosterone gives women a significant advantage even in women's categories then it is very possible they would be at a significant disadvantage in men's categories.
1.3.7.1.2. Con: This case preceded the most recent discoveries in the field, which mean this claim can no longer be supported.
1.3.7.1.2.1. Pro: High levels of natural testosterone give [“significantly”](https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/naturally-produced-testosterone-gives-female-athletes-significant-competitive-edge/) advanced performance in female athletes.
1.3.8. Con: Testosterone does not advantage sportswomen disproportionately more than other innate characteristics.
1.3.8.1. Con: Just because there are other factors that affect performance that are currently unregulated does not mean that those factors shouldn’t be regulated.
1.3.8.2. Pro: Vision plays a crucial element in a table-tennis players' skill levels, and is to a large extent [genetically determined](https://www.goodeyes.com/blog/is-great-eyesight-all-about-genetics/) \([Paul, 107](http://file:///Users/JJackson/Downloads/ROLE_OF_SPORTS_VISION_AND_EYE_HAND_COORDINATION_TR.pdf)\).
1.3.8.3. Pro: Height is an important factor in the success of individual basketball-players.
1.3.8.4. Pro: It is arbitrary that participants should have to have similar hormone levels when a host of other arbitrary biological factors impact sporting ability.
1.3.8.5. Pro: [Being wealthy](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/the-5-olympic-sports-where-being-rich-matters-the-most/259959/) has shown links to high performance in certain Olympic sports, which is an arbitrary qualifier that most athletes cannot control.
1.3.9. Pro: High levels of natural testosterone give significantly [advanced performance](https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/naturally-produced-testosterone-gives-female-athletes-significant-competitive-edge/) in female athletes, as it can improve their physical abilities in ways training cannot.
1.3.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.4. Con: Testosterone limits put pressure on women to take medication they might not otherwise wish to take.
1.4.1. Pro: Some sporting governing bodies allow for women with naturally high testosterone levels to participate so long as they [reduce their blood testosterone levels](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/26/606039409/iaaf-sets-new-limits-on-testosterone-levels-in-women?t=1537740597158) by taking medication, which can include hormonal birth control.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Hormonal birth control has many [common side effects](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/290196.php) including pain and depression, and has even been associated with deep vein thrombosis, benign liver tumors and some cancers. Nobody should have to undertake such risks unless they wish to of their own accord.
1.4.2. Pro: [Testosterone is important](https://breakingmuscle.com/fitness/the-role-of-testosterone-for-the-female-athlete) to female metabolic, sexual, and muscular function and it is also important for women to have a healthy hormone balance. Hence artificially altering testosterone levels in women can have adverse impacts on various aspects of a woman's life.
1.4.2.1. Pro: High level athletics requires participants to be in tune with their bodies; taking medication to change their hormonal levels will likely decrease their performance as they adjust to the change. For instance, hormonal birth control can cause [headaches, sudden pain or trouble breathing](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/how-safe-is-the-birth-control-pill), all of which would make athletic competition far more difficult.
1.4.3. Con: Female athletes who choose not to lower their testosterone levels will be still [eligible](https://www.iaaf.org/news/press-release/eligibility-regulations-for-female-classifica) to compete against men or in an intersex category, in national events, or switching to shorter or longer distances, offering them an alternative for competitive expression.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Allowing women to compete with men is not a viable option as it forces these women in a gender category that they do not identify with.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Switching to shorter or longer distances would limit the avenues provided for these women. This can potentially hinder their career growths.
1.4.4. Pro: Since sport is also the main source of income for many of these athletes there is an economic pressure to take medication to reduce their testosterone levels for fear that they would lose their livelihood.
1.4.4.1. Con: Women with high testosterone limits could be [allowed](https://www.iaaf.org/news/press-release/eligibility-regulations-for-female-classifica) to participate in men's divisions.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: The International Association of Athletics Federation has made a [statement](https://www.iaaf.org/news/press-release/eligibility-regulations-for-female-classifica) making women eligible to compete in men's classifications.
1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: Even if a woman's testosterone levels place her at an advantage in women's divisions, it might still leave her at a disadvantage in men's divisions.
1.4.4.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.
1.4.5. Con: In sports like boxing, athletes often have to do undesirable things like maintain a certain weight in order to compete at their desired level.
1.4.5.1. Con: Weight limits in sports do not involve artificial interventions condoned by governing bodies. In fact, using medication to reduce weight or increase weight is strictly [prohibited](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/sports/Pages/Weigh-Ins-Weight-Gain-Rules-for-Teen-Athletes.aspx).
1.4.5.2. Con: Those sports have multiple weight categories in which athletes can compete; if they become too heavy or too light for their current category, they move to another category. This is not analogous to not being allowed to compete at all or being forced to compete against men instead.
1.4.5.3. Con: Boxing specifically has granted rule exemptions in the past to protect traditionally disadvantaged groups, such a religious exemption to uniform requirements [to allow religious head coverings.](https://www.newsday.com/sports/columnists/barbara-barker/usa-boxing-to-allow-religious-head-coverings-1.13542761)
1.5. Con: Female athletes shouldn’t be penalized for something outside their control.
1.5.1. Con: There are actions that female athletes can take to meet these standards, so this is not out of their control.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Changing one's [diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods-that-lower-testosterone#section9) can reduce testosterone levels.
1.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.5.1.3. Pro: The [treatment](https://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2018-04-26/iaaf-rules-to-limit-testosterone-levels-for-female-runners) to reduce testosterone levels is a hormone supplement similar to the contraceptive pill taken by millions of women around the world. It is completely noninvasive and quite simple to administer.
1.5.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.5.1.3.2. Con: The process of diagnosing that a woman has naturally high testosterone levels involves procedures including very [invasive screenings](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/12/health/testosterone-and-hyperandrogenism-in-female-athletes/index.html). These are processes that should not be forced upon female athletes.
1.5.2. Pro: Some people enjoy watching sports because they identify with the athletes struggle to be their best and win. When athletes are prevented by things outside their control, their interest in watching may fall.
1.5.3. Pro: Women with intersex variations should get the same rights to [dignity and bodily integrity](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/26/human-rights-watch-iaaf-testosterone-limit-discrimination) as all women. Hence women should not be made to undergo unnecessary medical intervention to alter their hormone levels, simply because their naturally occurring testosterone is atypical.
1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.5.5. Pro: People should not be excluded from activities they love because of traits they were born with.
1.5.5.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.
1.5.5.2. Pro: Significant fluctuations in testosterone levels in women can be caused by a [mutation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5643412/) that affects hemoglobin production. Hence these women have no control over these levels.
1.5.6. Con: There is a precedent in sport for athletes being divided by things outside their control.
1.5.6.1. Pro: [Boxing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class_\(boxing\)) is divided into weight classes.
1.5.6.1.1. Con: Boxers have a considerable amount of control over which weight they wish to [compete in](https://www.teamusa.org/USA-Boxing/Features/2008/November/06/Selecting-a-Weight-Class), and can train and eat to move up or down a weight class.
1.6. Pro: It is important for sporting bodies to level the playing field among athletes.
1.6.1. Pro: The [International Association of Athletics Federations has a responsibility](https://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2018-04-26/iaaf-rules-to-limit-testosterone-levels-for-female-runners) to ensure a level playing field for athletes. This includes establishing a set of rules which ensure that success is determined by talent, dedication and hard work rather than other contributing factors.
1.6.2. Con: The International Olympic Committee and the International Association of Athletics Federations ruled out performing ["sex tests"](https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/22/8644547/high-testosterone-sports-policy-end-iaaf-ioc-intersex) on its athletes in 1999. It is hence contradictory for them to now enforce testosterone limits.
1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.3.6.
1.6.4. Con: Instead of pursuing women whose natural characteristics give them an advantage in sport, organisations such as the IAAF should work on eradicating doping, which is arguably a much more serious and widespread problem.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Over [100 athletes](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-buffaloes-race/fast-and-furious-in-the-mud-as-thai-buffalo-racers-mark-end-of-monsoon-idUSKCN1MX1I3) were found to have been doping during the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games.
1.6.4.2. Con: Limiting testosterone levels is important if the International Association of Athletics Federations wishes to reduce doping. If certain women in sports naturally have the advantage that is afforded to other women through doping then the latter would be more incentivized to indulge in doping, as they would consider this their only route towards success.
1.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.6.6. Pro: Women are likely to be discouraged from participating if they are forced to compete against women, who have a significant advantage over them. This could, in turn, reduce female participation in general.
1.6.7. Con: Sporting bodies banning the participation of certain athletes is tantamount to publicly body shaming them, as it would easily become apparent which athletes had been excluded and why.
1.6.7.1. Pro: [Caster Semenya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster_Semenya) has famously had her gender [called into question](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/29/what-is-an-intersex-athlete-explaining-the-case-of-caster-semenya) due to her testosterone levels.
1.6.7.2. Con: There is a difference between shaming someone’s body and appearance, and regulating participation to ensure fairness.
1.6.7.2.1. Pro: Tests can be sensitively handled in private so as to avoid a media circus.
1.6.7.2.1.1. Con: No matter how sensitively the tests themselves are carried out, the presence or absence of an athlete at an event will lead to a media circus regardless.
1.6.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: If a female athlete isn’t participating in an event that she was expected to, it opens up room for speculation about her testosterone limits.
1.6.7.3. Pro: [María José Martínez-Patiño](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2805%2967841-5) was publicly shamed when she was excluded from athletics on the basis of a chromosomal sex 'test'.
1.6.8. Pro: Sport is primarily for the benefit of spectators: it is only enjoyable to watch if the competition is fair.
1.6.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.2.1.
1.6.8.2. Con: It is not necessarily the case that sport is only enjoyable to watch if the competition is fair; spectacles, such as athletes breaking records and performing impressive feats \(which they may be more capable of doing with increased testosterone\) also contribute greatly to the enjoyment of watching sport.
1.6.9. Pro: It is difficult to distinguish between natural hormone levels and those that are a result of doping with androgens \([Basaria, 1535](https://watermark.silverchair.com/jcem1533.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAh0wggIZBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggIKMIICBgIBADCCAf8GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMZumKC1bEE2H2db_8AgEQgIIB0LCGUq3TOyhUxq-pSwNL-RIT3VvvB2bTrelPeKfXweMQcBKjwNqWPCXCxW5aoDRL9sxuJD4Kx7gPvhfO0oKnyzEkCiynS05hUory03t314rnG1W6pK7aJ740sY1iR8ZJmxLJOr7SY18GtjUuLRuNdbViCB1DYDHUCDacxlvM7qyrBY_keOreVSvI10HkgFV7Vga8wDPXzOOGtFBHpd67GxEm7I42WP_rwDJVWgPMnJ5LDbZ0NTthWldhx-Y1Dx42FZvrWxRSzvY9f1NAsgocgmtbqv6QTi9i450pUFhcH-NKZfQN_NdqlUsTh36HYn-dxTJIwLlSGzihnRFSnpIMGBDrjbTNC4yGguDK0-EMNJmvTak0HIOz8JRI21nycdOKSgjIqg9YNn01LRPk1HFTEQSZ136ARDeDRjDmsED_4dowsgsXwsrp30JFFYEKWwjaADMDr6oFJKzIji5fU1visbDsIds9tP1GO-tCVZRvjxxNb-l_nseNwW2NbifrHsTfCN5TBfBtRnVHbnxRRT3N2tSFwnxgKxItbJQhg4lvIKC28BeNkCXlgbPQ86Yfacd4Zt4TYsibGS0p1t09lUUpAFWySor4kvl9vSTnhFvcHpkw)\).
1.6.9.1. Con: There is the scientific potential to differentiate between doping with androgens and naturally high levels of testosterone \([Wood, 10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3264812/pdf/nihms-334274.pdf)\).
1.7. Con: Enforcing testosterone limits in sports is discriminatory.
1.7.1. Pro: Enforcing testosterone limits for women athletes is sexist.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Penalizing women for their hormone production reinforces traditional and harmful stereotypes of "masculine" women not being womanly enough.
1.7.1.2. Pro: There are no policies preventing men from participating in sport because of their natural hormones.
1.7.2. Pro: Enforcing testosterone limits in women's sport discriminates against transgender and intersex athletes.
1.7.2.1. Con: It would be appropriate to set testosterone limits in sport in regard to transgender women athletes, not all women.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: The basic principle of equality holds that transgender women ought not be treated any differently than cisgender women.
1.7.2.1.2. Pro: Many athletes must make sacrifices in order to compete competitively. It is possible for trans women to choose not to transition and continue to compete in men's categories until the end of their athletic career, rather than impacting the fairness of women's categories.
1.7.2.1.2.1. Con: Not transitioning can have serious effects on an individual's [mental health](https://theconversation.com/how-transitioning-leads-to-better-mental-health-and-job-satisfaction-84617): it is not a fair choice to force them to make.
1.7.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: An individual has more of an obligation to their own well-being and mental health than they do to sporting bodies’ perceptions of “fairness”.
1.7.2.1.3. Con: The majority of transgender women [cannot](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/2018/02/20/medicine-alone-does-not-completely-suppress-testosterone-levels-among-transgender-women/) bring their testosterone levels into the standard physiological range for women.
1.7.2.1.3.1. Pro: Forcing female athletes to take medication to alter their natural levels validate the [narratives](https://www.wired.com/story/testosterone-ruling-for-athletes-fuels-debate-over-natural-ability/) these women need to change themselves to be considered women in these sports. It hence furthers the misgendering of these women.
1.7.2.1.4. Pro: Transgender or intersex women have an unfair advantage over other female athletes.
1.7.2.1.4.1. Con: Many transgender and intersex competitors [face discrimination from teammates and coaches](http://www.ncaa.org/sport-science-institute/mind-body-and-sport-harassment-and-discrimination-lgbtq-student-athletes), making training more difficult for them.
1.7.2.1.4.2. Pro: A physiology professor at Otago University has stated that the testosterone levels of some transgender women give them a [competitive advantage](https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/99434993/professor-of-physiology-says-trans-athlete-has-advantage-in-speed-and-power).
1.7.2.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.2.1.
1.7.2.2. Con: -> See 1.7.2.1.2.
1.7.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.3.
1.7.2.4. Pro: Enforcing a limit on testosterone levels for female athletes pushes forward a gender binary, where the limit is literally used to differentiate between men and women. Enforcing such a binary in sports directly works against the efforts of the LGBTQ+ community and invalidates many people' gender identities.
1.7.2.4.1. Con: It is the act of classifying by gender in the first place, not an attempt to enforce that classification, that necessitates the distinction.
1.7.2.4.2. Pro: When the International Association of Athletics Federations introduced the testing of athletes for hyperandrogenism, female athletes [expressed](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/12/health/testosterone-and-hyperandrogenism-in-female-athletes/index.html) that they felt a coercion to conform to feminine ideals.
1.7.2.4.2.1. Pro: During [testing for testosterone levels](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/12/health/testosterone-and-hyperandrogenism-in-female-athletes/index.html), a lot of focus is placed on physical characteristics typical of being female. This includes a lack of body hair, voice pitch, and the size and shape of breasts. This put female athletes under pressure to look more feminine because if they didn't, they would face the scrutiny of the International Association of Athletics Federations.
1.7.2.4.2.2. Pro: Between [2011 and 2015](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/12/health/testosterone-and-hyperandrogenism-in-female-athletes/index.html), four unnamed athletes agreed to procedures that included partial clitoridectomy, the excision of the clitoris, in order to meet the International Association of Athletics Federations eligibility standards. The IAAF's regulation stated that an enlarged clitoris could be an indicator of severe hyperandrogenism.
1.7.2.4.2.2.1. Pro: Intersex Human Rights Australia [considers](https://ihra.org.au/25610/women-athletes-forced-clitorectomies/) this 'a gross violation of human rights'.
1.7.2.5. Con: -> See 1.7.2.1.4.
1.7.2.6. Pro: Inclusion of transgender and intersex women in women's sport is an optimal way to encourage broader societal acceptance.
1.7.2.6.1. Pro: Athletes and sportspeople who represent their country garner national support and affection even if they are part of minority groups.
1.7.2.6.1.1. Pro: Despite deep-seated racism, Paul Ince, Tessa Sanderson, and Nasser Hussain all become national heroes in Great Britain/England for their [performance](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1517672.stm) in their respective sports.
1.7.3. Pro: Enforcing testosterone limits in sports is racist.
1.7.3.1. Pro: The two most prominent recent cases of accusations of high testosterone levels have been against [Dutee Chand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutee_Chand) and [Caster Semenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster_Semenya), both athletes of colour.
1.7.3.2. Pro: The proposals have focused on sports in which the [global south](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/26/testosterone-ruling-women-athletes-caster-semanya-global-south) is prominent.
1.7.3.2.1. Pro: The main targets of this policy are women from [Asia and the African continent](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/26/606039409/iaaf-sets-new-limits-on-testosterone-levels-in-women).
1.7.4. Con: Discrimination is only a negative force if it discriminates against a group unfairly. In this case, it is increasing the fairness of women's sport.
1.7.5. Con: Restricting participation to women also discriminates against a group who cannot compete: provided the regulations are applied consistently, it is no different from other regulations applied to eligibility in sport.
1.7.5.1. Pro: [Nationality restrictions](http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/fivering_circus/2014/02/sochi_olympics_citizenship_rules_you_shouldn_t_have_to_be_an_american_to.html) prevent some athletes from competing at the Olympics who otherwise would be able to.
1.8. Con: Testosterone levels are an arbitrary metric to base participation on.
1.8.1. Pro: Testosterone levels are not fixed; in fact they [change](https://www.health24.com/Lifestyle/Woman/Your-body/12-testosterone-facts-20130403) dramatically during a woman's lifetime.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Women's testosterone levels [increase](https://www.health24.com/Lifestyle/Woman/Your-body/12-testosterone-facts-20130403) significantly with age, while those of men drop.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Testosterone rises in [anticipation](https://www.health24.com/Lifestyle/Woman/Your-body/12-testosterone-facts-20130403) of competition more in women than it does in men, researchers say.
1.8.2. Pro: A [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cen.12445) looked at 234 female athletes and found that 13.7% of women had high testosterone levels. That same study also found that 16.5% of elite male athletes had testosterone levels that fell below the "typical" range for men. Taken together, these numbers provide evidence for a significant "overlap between the sexes".
1.8.2.1. Con: A [study](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/99/11/4328/2836760) of 849 elite women athletes funded by the International Association of Athletics Federation has also found that only 1.5% of women had unusually high testosterone.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: The [reason for this difference](https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/22/8644547/high-testosterone-sports-policy-end-iaaf-ioc-intersex) is that this study pre-emptively excluded women who are intersex from its analysis. This move essentially defeated the purpose of figuring out what consists a normal range for testosterone in all women, since all women were never in the sample.
1.8.3. Pro: Studies have found that genetic factors affect [30-80% of an individual's athletic ability](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/traits/athleticperformance).
1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.
1.8.5. Pro: Naturally occurring testosterone levels do not change a women's chromosomal genetics. Women should be qualified on a X,X chromosome basis not a naturally occurring testosterone level.
1.8.5.1. Con: 'Functional testosterone' correlates with the [impact](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/03/using-testosterone-to-categorise-male-and-female-athletes-isnt-perfect-but-its-the-best-solution-we-have) on performance, unlike other gender tests.
1.8.5.2. Con: Chromosomal tests have many of the same issues as testosterone tests.
1.8.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.3.
1.8.6. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.2.1.
1.8.7. Con: Any test for who counts as a 'woman' is going to be arbitrary because no metric is perfect. Testosterone is the best objective measure that exists.
