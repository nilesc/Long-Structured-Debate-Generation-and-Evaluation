Discussion Title: Is the world of Harry Potter really the place to be?

1. Would we like to live in the world of Harry Potter?
1.1. Con: The magical education system is inadequate.
1.1.1. Pro: Hogwarts, the only British wizarding school, has many structural and security problems.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Hogwarts' education system is insufficient in many respects.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Students at Hogwarts do not take many practical subjects. They do not learn mathematics, science, writing or foreign languages, and learning about the non-magical world is optional.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Students at Hogwarts cannot learn many humanities subjects, like philosophy or sociology, which would help them think about the world.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: A solid foundation in mathematics builds analytical skills that are transferable to other subjects. It is therefore unfortunate that Hogwarts students are not taught these skills.
1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Since English is the main language spoken in the wizarding world of Britain, students ought to learn English grammar and literature while at Hogwarts.
1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: As is the case with a Muggle child, it would be useful for wizarding students to have a basic understanding of the human body, the functions of the various organs, first aid, nutrition and hygiene.
1.1.1.1.1.5. Con: Students can learn mathematics by taking arithmancy.
1.1.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Arithmancy is more a form of divination than mathematics, which involves predicting the future with numbers and numerology. It is completely different to Muggle mathematics, which wizards and witches could still benefit from.
1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Arithmancy is incredibly important in the wizarding world as it studies the magical properties of numbers, which is useful for many aspects of magic, especially Curse Breaking.
1.1.1.1.1.5.1.2. Con: Most wizards appear to know rudimentary arithmetic. It is unclear what benefit more advanced Muggle mathematics would have in the wizarding world.
1.1.1.1.1.6. Con: Students at Hogwarts learn what is practical from the wizarding perspective.
1.1.1.1.1.6.1. Pro: The primary use of subjects like mathematics and sciences is in creating and developing technology. Since the wizarding world uses magic rather than technology, those subjects are not useful.
1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1. Con: Knowledge of mathematics is important in functioning as an adult. All people \(including wizards\) need to interact with the financial system for example.
1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1. Con: The level of mathematics needed to function as an adult is of a rudimentary level that is easily taught at home, in the same way that wizards appear to be taught how to read and write.
1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.1. Con: A poor knowledge of mathematics and currency conversion makes it harder for wizards, for example Mr Weasley, to use Muggle transportation or other services when the need arises.
1.1.1.1.1.7. Pro: For students who come from wizarding families, this can mean they never get any education about the Muggle world, which is not very practical and encourages separation between wizards and Muggles.
1.1.1.1.1.7.1. Con: Muggle Studies is an elective subject students can take from Third Year through to Seventh Year.
1.1.1.1.1.7.1.1. Con: Muggle Studies is taught by a wizard meaning the information is unlikely to be a fully accurate representation of the Muggle world.
1.1.1.1.1.8. Pro: Language classes would be useful to wizards as well as Muggles, given that wizarding communities span the globe.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Official education does not begin until witches and wizards are 11 years old.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Given that the point of magical education is to train them in using magic, it would not be practical to begin this earlier as they are likely to struggle with spells memorisation and completion.
1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Without formal education until the age of 11 \(unless they are Muggle-born\), most wizards receive less rudimentary education like reading and writing than Muggles.
1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Since Hogwarts students are expected to read and write extensively for their assignments, it is likely that they have adequate prior training in reading and writing.
1.1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: Children of wizarding families sometimes [attend](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/11745/what-do-wizard-children-do-before-attending-hogwarts) a Muggle primary school prior to magical education, but otherwise are home schooled until they are 11.
1.1.1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Putting wizarding children in Muggle schools risks the Muggle children's safety, since wizarding children often do magic by accident or because they do not know better.
1.1.1.1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: Children often use magic accidentally in response to feeling angry, scared or confused. This often has disastrous consequences.
1.1.1.1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Harry Potter accidentally let a boa constrictor free while in the zoo.
1.1.1.1.2.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Harry Potter accidentally caused his cousin's aunt to magically inflate and float away when she insulted his late parents.
1.1.1.1.2.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: Ariana Dumbledore killed her mother in an explosion of accidental magic.
1.1.1.1.2.2.2.2. Con: Putting wizarding children in Muggle schools risks the exposure of the wizarding world.
1.1.1.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.2.2.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: There is no higher education.
1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Wizards get specialized training for job positions after they leave school.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Aurors undergo three years of intensive training after school to make sure they are equipped to do their jobs.
1.1.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.6.
1.1.1.1.5. Pro: New methodologies are not embraced.
1.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: When Snape was a Hogwarts student, he made vast improvements to the art of potion-making. But those methods were not incorporated into the teaching curriculum and the previous ways of making potions are still taught.
1.1.1.1.5.2. Con: Hagrid frequently used new and innovative ways to teach Care of Magical Creatures.
1.1.1.1.5.2.1. Con: It is probably untrue that these methodologies are embraced. Hagrid is not viewed favourably as a teacher by many.
1.1.1.1.6. Pro: Many professors are incompetent to the point of uselessness.
1.1.1.1.6.1. Con: This seems to be a problem related to the Hogwarts hiring procedure as opposed to an inherent incompetence of all potential teachers.
1.1.1.1.6.2. Pro: Hagrid was appointed to teach a dangerous Care of Magical Creatures class despite never having completed his own education.
1.1.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Though Hagrid's classes were sometimes well planned, he also had his students study [flobberworms](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Flobberworm) for an entire term.
1.1.1.1.6.3. Pro: Professor Trelawney barely teaches her students anything.
1.1.1.1.6.4. Pro: The post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher enjoys a succession of incompetent teachers like Quirrell, Lockhart, and Umbridge.
1.1.1.1.6.5. Pro: Hogwarts' professors do not respect the rules themselves.
1.1.1.1.6.5.1. Pro: Professor McGonagall got special permission from Dumbledore to get Harry Potter a Nimbus 2000 even though first years are not allowed to have their own broomsticks at Hogwarts.
1.1.1.1.6.5.2. Pro: The creation of new species is illegal by law \(1965 Ban on Experimental Breeding\) but Rubeus Hagrid created the [Blast-Ended Skrewt](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Blast-Ended_Skrewt).
1.1.1.1.6.5.2.1. Pro: The Blast-Ended Skrewt is a hybrid creature bred by Rubeus Hagrid by crossing manticores and fire crabs.
1.1.1.1.6.5.2.1.1. Pro: The males have stingers and the females have suckers on their body to suck blood.
1.1.1.1.6.5.2.1.2. Pro: Adult Skrewts grow ten feet long, and are incredibly dangerous and lethal. They resemble giant scorpions with stingers curled over their backs. Their shiny armour deflects most spells and they use their blasts to propel themselves at a foe.
1.1.1.1.6.5.2.1.3. Pro: Hagrid began breeding the Skrewts at the beginning of the school year, and had several hundred. By the following year, he only had one left as they often cannibalised each other.
1.1.1.1.6.5.3. Pro: Albus Dumbledore encouraged Harry Potter and Hermione Granger to use the [Time-Turner](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Time-Turner) for a purpose it was never intended for and to carry out an illegal act by helping Sirius escape from the Ministry.
1.1.1.1.6.5.4. Pro: Hogwarts teachers have been known to [send students to the Forbidden Forest](http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/harrypotter/section12.rhtml) as detention and, on one occasion, [turn a student into a ferret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HobPkv5TELA) as punishment.
1.1.1.1.6.5.4.1. Pro: Dolores Umbridge's detention sessions consisted of [physical torture](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Quill), and left Harry Potter with permanent scars.
1.1.1.1.6.5.4.1.1. Con: The use of the black quill would have been illegal given that corporal punishment is not a generally accepted practice at Hogwarts and Harry was repeatedly advised to report Professor Umbridge's actions to Professor McGonagall.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Hogwarts is a socially highly stratified school, which makes for anything but a pleasant school culture.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Because all British wizards go to one school, there is less social stratification overall; even if there is internal social stratification within Hogwarts, there is none of the extreme inter-school stratification that is present in the Muggle world.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: The houses give students an opportunity to develop their greatest strength or most distinctive quality.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Gryffindor house was founded for the bravest, Ravenclaw for the cleverest, Hufflepuff for hard workers, and Slytherin for those with great ambition.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Students are separated into various houses from First Year and encouraged to compete against each other and work for their house, for example through Quidditch.
1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Most classes at early years are separated by house which discourages interhouse relationships.
1.1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Hogwarts’ sorting is a rigid system that brands and labels students based on the attributes they valued at the young age of eleven.
1.1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: It is not possible to change your house once you are sorted but values and choices evolve with time.
1.1.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Sorting children based on certain traits and attributes leads to the making of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Spending seven years in an environment that continuously imposes a certain sets of traits and expectations on you can lead to an internalization of those traits and a difficulty in outgrowing them in later years.
1.1.1.2.3.3. Pro: This segregation at Hogwarts hampers socialization and limits interaction to just people of your own house that share your traits, rather than different types of witches and wizards.
1.1.1.2.3.3.1. Con: The segregation encourages socialization by giving like-minded students easier access to one another.
1.1.1.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: The House system is good because it gives the young students who have just been separated from their families a new family and the opportunity to form close relationships and support systems in the new, school environment.
1.1.1.2.3.3.1.2. Pro: This segregation gives students an opportunity to interact more closely and bond with people who value and share the same traits.
1.1.1.2.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: Students don't only get sorted based on the traits that they have, but also on the traits that they value.
1.1.1.2.3.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: The Sorting Hat considered putting Harry in Slytherin but he was sorted into Gryffindor because he valued bravery over ambition.
1.1.1.2.3.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: Even though Hermione’s natural strength lies in her brain and studiousness, she sees friendship and bravery as the most important traits in a person. This is why she was sorted into Gryffindor instead of Ravenclaw.
1.1.1.2.3.3.1.2.1.3. Pro: Peter Pettigrew was sorted into Gryffindor even though he was not particularly brave, because he valued that trait.
1.1.1.2.3.3.1.3. Con: Diversity in social groups benefits all students. Learning with a diverse group encourages collaboration and a better understanding of people from different backgrounds.
1.1.1.2.3.3.2. Con: Only parts of the student experience are segregated by house. Life within the houses doesn't constitute the whole of the students’ social lives at Hogwarts.
1.1.1.2.3.3.2.1. Pro: Students interact with each other the entire day on a daily basis. They take classes, share the dining hall and visit Hogsmeade with other houses.
1.1.1.2.3.3.2.1.1. Con: Most students seem to spend the overwhelming majority of their time with students from the same house.
1.1.1.2.3.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Students are not allowed to visit the common room or dormitories of houses that they do not belong to, so are restricted to spending time only with people in their own houses for some periods.
1.1.1.2.3.3.3. Con: There is a fair amount of diversity even within houses. Although students fit into their respective houses because of a few shared traits, they possess other traits too and are different from each other.
1.1.1.2.3.3.3.1. Pro: Gryffindor has reckless students like James Potter, Sirius Black and Fred and George Weasley but also more serious students like Percy Weasley and Hermione Granger.
1.1.1.2.3.3.3.2. Pro: Although Slytherin house has a bad reputation, many smart and good wizards, like Horace Slughorn and Merlin, belonged to it.
1.1.1.2.3.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.3.3.2.1.1.1.
1.1.1.2.3.4. Pro: The competition among houses even has the potential to poison the atmosphere within houses: students are exposed to peer pressure and treated according to whether they win or lose house points.
1.1.1.2.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.3.3.1.1.
1.1.1.2.3.6. Con: Many Muggle schools also place students in houses that they compete on behalf of. This does not necessarily have to be a negative and divisive thing.
1.1.1.2.3.7. Pro: This is particularly pervasive at Hogwarts because the sorting hat assesses each student before placing them in a house. Your house indirectly becomes a measure of your worth.
1.1.1.2.3.7.1. Con: Each house emphasizes a different, desirable quality and there isn't a value judgement placed on students for belonging to a particular house.
1.1.1.2.3.7.1.1. Con: Hufflepuff is [often viewed](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hufflepuff) by other students as being the house for less competent wizards and witches.
1.1.1.2.3.7.1.1.1. Pro: This suggests that there is a devaluing of the traits of kindness and fairness in Hogwarts.
1.1.1.2.3.7.1.2. Con: There is an intense stigma associated with being in Slytherin.
1.1.1.2.3.7.1.2.1. Con: The stigma only existed because of Slytherin House's history of producing Dark Wizards. This stigma is likely to reduce over the years after Voldemort's defeat.
1.1.1.2.3.7.1.2.1.1. Con: The stigma against Slytherin is broader than just their association with Dark Wizards. It is born from a view that their attitude is one of superiority, highlighted by things like the fact their password is, at one point, Pure-Blood.
1.1.1.2.3.7.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Salazar Slytherin, who helped found Hogwarts, argued that they should [only admit pure-bloods](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Muggle-born) to the school.
1.1.1.2.3.7.1.2.2. Pro: The traits associated with Slytherin house, such as ambition, cunning and self-preservation, are not necessarily negative traits but are viewed as such in Hogwarts.
1.1.1.2.3.7.1.2.3. Con: But this stigma is well-founded. Slytherin House has highly negative attitudes towards Muggle-borns and many of its students have been Dark Wizards.
1.1.1.2.3.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.3.3.1.2.1.
1.1.1.2.3.7.3. Pro: Treating people as group members means that people can ignore all of the diverse and detailed information associated with individuals. \(McGarty, Yzerbyt and Spears. [Pg.4](https://perso.uclouvain.be/vincent.yzerbyt/McGarty%20Yzerbyt%20&%20Spears%20MYS%202002.pdf)\)
1.1.1.2.3.7.4. Pro: For example, Gryffindors are assumed to be brave while Slytherins are supposedly cunning.
1.1.1.2.3.8. Con: Competitions incentivise good behaviour and encourage fun, friendly rivalries. They are not a bad thing.
1.1.1.2.3.8.1. Con: Hogwarts competitions do not encourage good behaviour. They are rife with [cheating](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Inquisitorial_Squad) and [foul play](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Quidditch).
1.1.1.2.3.8.2. Con: Hogwarts competitions do not encourage fun and friendly rivalries. Slytherins and Gryffindors are known to hate each other, and this is perpetuated through the competition for the House Cup.
1.1.1.2.3.8.3. Pro: Students are given points for study and good behaviour, while points are removed for rule-breaking and bullying.
1.1.1.2.3.8.3.1. Con: Teachers are very biased in the way they award house points: some such as Snape tend to favour their own house and punish the others.
1.1.1.2.3.8.3.1.1. Pro: This is particularly true as most teachers went through Hogwarts themselves and thus have a natural bias toward the house they were in.
1.1.1.2.3.8.3.1.2. Pro: Dumbledore awarded enough points to Gryffindor to make them win the House Cup instead of Slytherin even though the term had officially ended. On the other hand, McGonagall did not take away any points from Harry and Ron after they crashed the flying car into the Whomping Willow, since the term had not yet started.
1.1.1.2.3.9. Con: Friendships and relationships between the houses are common.
1.1.1.2.3.9.1. Pro: Luna Lovegood from Ravenclaw was best friends with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Neville, who were all Gryffindors.
1.1.1.2.3.9.2. Pro: Many cross-house friendships were formed through [Dumbledore's Army](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army).
1.1.1.2.3.9.2.1. Con: Slytherins were excluded from Dumbledore's Army.
1.1.1.2.3.9.3. Pro: Cho Chang, a Ravenclaw, dated Cedric Diggory and, later, Harry Potter. Both were Triwizard champions for other houses.
1.1.1.2.3.9.4. Con: This is largely true between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. It is not, however, between Slytherin and the other houses.
1.1.1.2.3.10. Pro: The house points system is not fair and encourages divisions amongst the student body.
1.1.1.2.3.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.3.8.3.1.
1.1.1.2.4. Pro: There are stark separations among students that clearly elevate older students over younger students, for example the right to own brooms, the right to access Hogsmeade, etc.
1.1.1.2.4.1. Con: Muggle boarding schools in some parts of the world implement a system of a '[gate pass](http://www.beverlyhills.co.in/rules-regulation.php)' which is a signed form the students need to show the school security guards if they want to leave campus.
1.1.1.2.4.2. Con: This system is not imposed out of malice but to ensure the safety of the younger students.
1.1.1.2.5. Con: Many schools in the Muggle world are also stratified through competitions and age specific privileges. This problem is neither unique to, nor worse at, Hogwarts.
1.1.1.2.6. Pro: Some students are made prefects in Hogwarts and thus clearly elevated above others.
1.1.1.2.6.1. Con: Prefects are a feature of many Muggle schools in the UK and around the world, so this should not be used as a justification to not live in the wizarding world.
1.1.1.2.6.1.1. Con: There is more choice of schools in the Muggle world so someone could just choose to go elsewhere.
1.1.1.2.7. Pro: Hogwarts is a place where bullying is rampant and teachers seem to care little.
1.1.1.2.7.1. Pro: Numerous teachers turn a blind eye to bullying, for example Snape and Mad-Eye Moody.
1.1.1.2.7.2. Pro: Even some of the greatest heroes of the First Wizarding War were [bullies](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Marauders) at Hogwarts.
1.1.1.2.7.3. Pro: Some Hogwarts students have been known to use [dark magic](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Mulciber_\(Marauder-era\)) on one another for fun.
1.1.1.2.7.4. Pro: When Hogwarts students are annoyed at one another, they often resort to [hexes](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Bat-Bogey_Hex) or even [punches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWGYKrh2YEo).
1.1.1.2.7.4.1. Pro: Harry Potter once used the curse Sectumsempra on Draco Malfoy without knowing what it would do. It caused serious damage in the form of cuts and wounds.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Hogwarts is more dangerous than a Muggle boarding school.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: Hogwarts has a large staff of professors who can more effectively protect students from potential dangers, because they know magic.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: Hogwarts is physically isolated making external threats less likely.
1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: External threats to Hogwarts are most likely to be magical in nature. Hogwarts' surroundings are easy to get to through a number of magical means.
1.1.1.3.3. Pro: Twice during Harry Potter's time at Hogwarts, Death Eaters managed to invade Hogwarts and battles took place. First there was the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, when Dumbledore died. Second there was the Battle of Hogwarts that led to the downfall of Voldemort.
1.1.1.3.3.1. Con: Both instances of Death Eaters getting into Hogwarts took place during the Second Wizarding War. This represents extraordinary circumstances; hardly any school would be safe in wartime.
1.1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: This is especially true in the case of the Wizarding War. Since Hogwarts was a very integral part of Tom Riddle's development as a wizard and quest for power, Hogwarts became a focal point during the war.
1.1.1.3.3.2. Con: Hogwarts was probably safer in this situation than Muggle schools would have been due to its magical protection including gargoyles.
1.1.1.3.3.3. Pro: Draco Malfoy, a student at Hogwarts, managed to easily arrange for Death Eaters to enter the school through use of a magical cabinet.
1.1.1.3.4. Con: Hogwarts was known as the [safest place](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/275951-gringotts-was-the-safest-place-in-the-world-for-something) in wizarding Britain to hide something.
1.1.1.3.4.1. Con: Hogwarts being a safe place to hide an object does not necessarily mean it is also a safe place for students.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1. Con: Hogwarts has a series of protective enchantments placed on it which protect it from external dangers.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.3.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.2. Con: There was no particular magical protection on the gates of Hogwarts until Voldemort's return.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: Hogwarts’ gates were bewitched by Albus Dumbledore after Voldemort's return so they couldn’t be unlocked through magical means. Anti-intruder jinxes of some sort were also put on them.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Prior to that, students could simply walk through the gates, with a brief security check at the door into the castle.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: The gates did not stop or prevent cursed items.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Harry was able to bring the [cursed necklace](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Opal_Necklace) that Katie Bell touched all the way up to the castle from Hogsmeade unopposed until Filch stopped them.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: After the Ministry of Magic acknowledged Voldemort's return, Filch was forced to manually search students' luggage upon their return to Hogwarts.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.2.3. Con: It is perfectly reasonable to have a security level proportionate to the threat. It would be unnecessary to have some of these measures in place in times of total peace.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: The same logic is regularly employed at Muggle centres. For example, even though increased security would always be safer, airports tend to increase their security only in response to specific threats.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.3. Con: Dangerous items can be smuggled into the castle via Owl Post.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: Fred and George offered a 'discreet' mailing service for items from their joke shop, including love potions. Such potions would be disguised as ordinary medicines.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: This is believed by Hermione to be how [Romilda Vane](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Romilda_Vane) managed to get a love potion into the castle.
1.1.1.3.4.1.1.3.2. Con: Dangerous items can be smuggled into Muggle boarding schools via Muggle post.
1.1.1.3.4.2. Con: This may have been its reputation however in reality this was not the case.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1. Pro: The Philosopher's Stone is protected only by enchantments and puzzles that three eleven year olds can break through.
1.1.1.3.4.2.2. Pro: Voldemort hid a horcrux \(the diadem of Ravenclaw\) in Hogwarts thinking it would never be found. It only took Harry a matter of hours to find and destroy it.
1.1.1.3.5. Con: Hogwarts has numerous portraits whose occupants fulfill the roles of mobile surveillance cameras and alarm system.
1.1.1.3.5.1. Pro: The portrait of the Fat Lady refused to grant then-suspected mass-murderer Sirius Black access to the Gryffindor Tower when he broke into Hogwarts.
1.1.1.3.5.2. Con: The varying personalities of the inhabitants of portraits make them unreliable. Sir Cadogan allowed Sirius Black to enter Gryffindor Tower, potentially endangering the lives of students.
1.1.1.3.5.2.1. Pro: It is impossible to know if all of the subjects of the paintings in Hogwarts are well-meaning or trustworthy.
1.1.1.3.6. Con: During times of concern about safety, Hogwarts has hired [security trolls](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Security_Troll), who are specially trained to guard places and objects.
1.1.1.3.6.1. Pro: In 1993, [Dumbledore hired security trolls](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Security_Troll) to guard the Fat Lady's portrait after she was attacked by Sirius Black who was attempting to enter Gryffindor Tower.
1.1.1.3.6.2. Con: Muggle boarding schools rarely, if ever, experience such threat that they need to hire additional security.
1.1.1.3.7. Pro: The building itself is unsafe.
1.1.1.3.7.1. Pro: The staircases move, even while students are walking on them.
1.1.1.3.7.2. Pro: There are [secret entrances](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Secret_passages_at_Hogwarts) into the castle that aren't properly monitored.
1.1.1.3.7.3. Pro: The castle contains many tall towers which pose safety risks.
1.1.1.3.7.3.1. Pro: The staircase to the [Owlery Tower](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/West_Tower) is outdoors meaning there is a risk of slipping on ice in colder months.
1.1.1.3.7.3.2. Pro: The Astronomy Tower is seven storeys above ground and is surrounded by a parapet. This is a safety risk as falling from the tower would almost certainly result in death.
1.1.1.3.7.3.2.1. Con: The tower is generally not allowed to be accessed outside of classes.
1.1.1.3.7.3.3. Pro: Both Gryffindor and Ravenclaw's house dormitories are located in towers seven storeys above ground. If a student fell from a window in one of these towers the fall would almost certainly result in their death.
1.1.1.3.7.3.3.1. Con: This could easily be resolved by putting grills on the windows.
1.1.1.3.7.3.4. Con: This risk is not significantly different from multi-storey schools and buildings in general in the Muggle world.
1.1.1.3.8. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.4.1.1.
1.1.1.3.9. Pro: Quidditch is more dangerous than Muggle sports.
1.1.1.3.9.1. Pro: Players can get fatigued because Quidditch matches have no set time limits and can go on for weeks.
1.1.1.3.9.1.1. Con: During a [Quidditch World Cup](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Quidditch) match that lasted for days, the normal rule of not being allowed to substitute players was waived to allow players to get some sleep.
1.1.1.3.9.2. Pro: Players are not allowed to be substituted in the case of injury which can incentivise them to play on despite being seriously injured rather than leaving their team short a player.
1.1.1.3.9.3. Con: The sorts of injuries that Quidditch can cause \(broken bones; falls from brooms\) can be fixed with magic \(magical healing or levitation charms\).
1.1.1.3.9.3.1. Con: Bludgers are potentially lethal, and no practically available magic is capable of resurrection.
1.1.1.3.9.4. Pro: Quidditch occurs on unstable flying platforms at great heights, and contains fast-flying balls that attempt to hit players.
1.1.1.3.9.5. Con: Certain popular Muggle sports are very dangerous, like American football, which causes lasting brain damage in a very high percentage of players.
1.1.1.3.9.5.1. Pro: [99%](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/25/health/cte-nfl-players-brains-study/index.html) of deceased NFL players' brains that were donated to scientific research showed chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative brain disease.
1.1.1.3.9.5.2. Pro: There is [evidence](http://www.npr.org/2017/07/25/539198429/study-cte-found-in-nearly-all-donated-nfl-player-brains) that there is a link between American football and concussions.
1.1.1.3.9.6. Con: Quidditch is a voluntary activity, and played only by a relatively small percentage of wizards.
1.1.1.3.10. Pro: The curriculum at Hogwarts seems to care little about the safety of students.
1.1.1.3.10.1. Pro: At Hogwarts, teenagers are taught in class how to utilize deadly magic, work with plants whose scream can kill and brew chemical weapons-level potions.
1.1.1.3.10.1.1. Pro: Hogwarts students are taught how to duel, which is essentially the Muggle equivalent of a fight to the death.
1.1.1.3.10.1.1.1. Con: Duels are not necessarily fights to the death, it is seemingly rare that someone dies in one.
1.1.1.3.10.1.1.1.1. Pro: The parties involved usually agree to [limits on spells](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Duelling) to be used during the duel. This indicates that duelists generally agree not to use particularly dangerous or illegal spells, such as the Unforgivable Curses.
1.1.1.3.10.1.1.1.2. Pro: Even the most famous and high stakes of duels, such as that between Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1945, finishes in defeat rather than death.
1.1.1.3.10.1.1.1.2.1. Con: This is perhaps because Dumbledore used to be in love with Grindelwald and made the conscious decision to spare the latter's life.
1.1.1.3.10.1.1.2. Con: Students are only taught to duel in response to a specific threat at one time. In general the practice is banned at Hogwarts.
1.1.1.3.10.1.2. Pro: Second year Hogwarts students are required to study [Mandrakes](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Mandrake) using only earmuffs for protection, despite the fact that the scream of a baby Mandrake can render a student unconscious for hours.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3. Pro: The Hogwarts teachers hosted The Triwizard Tournament in 1994, even though the tournament was renowned for being extremely dangerous, and had previously resulted in the death of its participants.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.1. Con: Participation is voluntary; the school does not force any student to expose himself/herself to the tournament's dangers.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.1.1. Con: Students are pressured to participate by the promise of fame, glory and a thousand Galleons cash prize. The decision to participate is coerced at best.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Those reasons are similar to the reasons many Muggles choose to enter into sporting competitions.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The difference in Muggle sporting competitions is that the potential for significant harm is miniscule compared to the Triwizard Tournament.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Young people are more likely to be influenced by the prospect of winning a large sum of money.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: The thousand Galleons prize money was the primary reason why Fred and George Weasley were interested in the Triwizard Tournament.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.1.1.3. Con: Only very few students are allowed to enter, and the selection process is rigorous, so the chance of being pressured into the tournament is low.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.1.1.3.1. Con: As the degree of selectivity and the rigorous selection process are a part of the legend surrounding the Triwizard Tournament, they are partly responsible for coercing the students to enter.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.1.1.4. Pro: Younger generations are more likely to be [obsessed with becoming famous](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/why-are-young-people-so-obsessed-with-becoming-famous-012113.html) than others. This is also a coercive force in entering the Tournament.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.1.2. Con: Young students cannot reasonably be expected to foresee the long term implications of such decisions. It is the responsibility of the faculty to limit access to dangerous choices in the first place.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.1.2.1. Con: According to the revised rules, only students over the age of seventeen were allowed to enter or compete in the tournament. Seventeen-year-olds are legally considered adults in the wizarding world and can make decisions for themselves.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.1.3. Con: Harry Potter did not put his name in the Goblet and yet he was selected as a Hogwarts champion. He therefore had to compete despite not choosing it for himself, and being younger than the rules require entrants to be.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.1.3.1. Con: This was merely the result of Barty Crouch Junior's manipulation of the Goblet of Fire and would not have happened under normal circumstances.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.2. Con: Other sports competitions in schools are also dangerous yet generally accepted. An example is high school football in the United States which is believed to [cause brain trauma](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-foodball-head-trauma/brain-trauma-widespread-among-high-school-football-players-researchers-say-idUSKCN0S12AT20151007) in many players.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.3. Pro: The tasks at the Hogwarts Triwizard Tournament included requiring champions to battle a dragon, rescue their friends from the bottom of the Black Lake, and find their way through a maze full of obstacles and dangers.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.4. Pro: Cedric Diggory, one of the Hogwarts champions, was killed after completing the third task.
1.1.1.3.10.1.3.4.1. Con: This was not the fault of the competition, but the result of Barty Crouch Jr. turning the Triwizard Cup into a portkey, which transported Cedric and Harry Potter to the graveyard in Little Hangleton.
1.1.1.3.11. Pro: Hogwarts teachers are irresponsible and contribute to a dangerous and unhealthy school environment.
1.1.1.3.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.3.8.3.1.
1.1.1.3.11.2. Con: Many Hogwarts teachers, such as Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick, seem to be fair, and also care about the wellbeing of their students.
1.1.1.3.11.2.1. Pro: Professor McGonagall remains at Hogwarts when it is being run by Snape and the Death Eaters, and does her best to support and protect students.
1.1.1.3.11.2.2. Pro: Professors Flitwick, Sprout and Lupin are all knowledgable teachers, who are encouraging and supportive of their students in classes and seek to provide a good wizarding education.
1.1.1.3.11.3. Pro: It was irresponsible for Dumbledore to appoint Remus Lupin, a known werewolf, as a teacher without letting the students or their parents know about his condition.
1.1.1.3.11.3.1. Con: Parents or students do not have an overwhelming right to know all the immutable characteristics of Professors who teach at an educational institution.
1.1.1.3.11.3.1.1. Con: Parents and students do have a right to information that might directly undermine the health and safety of students on campus. Remus Lupin was a liability the night he did not take his [Wolfsbane potion](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wolfsbane_Potion) and could have easily maimed or killed a student during his transformation.
1.1.1.3.11.3.1.1.1. Con: The sequence of events which led to Lupin not taking his potion was unlikely and impossible to predict. Dumbledore had good reason to assume Lupin would take his potion without concern.
1.1.1.3.11.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Dumbledore knew better than anyone the relationship Lupin and Sirius shared since their childhood, and that Sirius wanted to come to Hogwarts to speak with Harry Potter.
1.1.1.3.11.3.2. Con: If Dumbledore had followed this process, Lupin would never have been given the job due to unreasonable prejudices of the wizarding population. This would be unjust for a man of Lupin's ability.
1.1.1.3.11.3.2.1. Con: The stigma against werewolves is regrettable but a school full of children is not the best place to hire one in the first place.
1.1.1.3.11.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.11.3.1.1.1.
1.1.1.3.11.3.2.2. Con: Dumbledore could have used his sizable influence and powers of persuasion to get Lupin a job outside of Hogwarts, or kept Lupin at Hogwarts after having done due diligence toward his students.
1.1.1.3.11.3.2.2.1. Con: The view towards werewolves means that Lupin would have struggled to find a job anywhere.
1.1.1.3.11.4. Pro: Dumbledore acted irresponsibly by appointing Rubeus Hagrid as the Care of Magical Creatures professor at Hogwarts.
1.1.1.3.11.4.1. Pro: Hagrid, though a great person, was known for his love of dangerous creatures and put the safety of his students at risk while teaching his classes.
1.1.1.3.11.4.1.1. Pro: Hagrid introduced Third Year students to Hippogriffs in their first lesson, and one of them injured a student.
1.1.1.3.11.4.1.1.1. Con: Draco Malfoy was only injured because he was too arrogant to listen to Hagrid's instructions. This is largely Malfoy's fault and not Hagrid's, as Harry Potter was able to interact with the Hippogriff without being harmed.
1.1.1.3.11.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Draco Malfoy was thirteen years old at the time. Thirteen-year-olds should not be put in situations where they could be maimed if they don't follow instructions correctly.
1.1.1.3.11.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Thirteen year old students, both wizarding and Muggle, are involved in many activities endorsed by schools and parents, for example, quidditch, wrestling, boxing, football, cricket and rugby where they risk serious injury to themselves or their peers if they do not follow instructions correctly.
1.1.1.3.11.4.1.2. Pro: Hagrid made his Fourth Year students raise Blast-Ended Skrewts, dangerous hybrid creatures of his own creation, without fully being aware of how dangerous they were, or what they ate.
1.1.1.3.11.4.2. Pro: Hagrid was appointed even though he was under-qualified to teach.
1.1.1.3.11.4.2.1. Pro: Hagrid was appointed despite the availability of a more qualified, popular and better teacher, Professor Grubby-Plank.
1.1.1.3.11.4.2.2. Con: Having served as Game Keeper at Hogwarts for decades, Hagrid had interacted with enough dangerous creatures to be qualified enough to teach students at the time of his appointment.
1.1.1.3.11.4.2.2.1. Con: Hagrid shared a unique bond with dangerous creatures that made him a great Game Keeper, but not necessarily a good teacher.
1.1.1.3.11.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.2.
1.1.1.3.11.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.5.4.
1.1.1.3.11.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.7.
1.1.1.3.11.7. Pro: The teachers are not well screened; twice during Harry's tenure at the school the Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher was working directly for Voldemort.
1.1.1.3.11.8. Pro: Potions that resemble psychoactive drugs, such as Felix Felicis, are available in Hogwarts and even given to students by teachers.
1.1.1.3.11.9. Pro: Hogwarts students are given access to dangerous levels of control over one another when they are taught about [love potions](https://www.pottermore.com/features/love-potion-guide-hogwarts-most-intoxicating-tonic) and [polyjuice potion](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion).
1.1.1.3.12. Pro: Following Dumbledore's death, Hogwarts was essentially overtaken by Death Eaters, who taught classes in the Dark Arts and bullied students.
1.1.1.3.12.1. Pro: Death Eater Alecto Carrow was put in charge of a compulsory Muggle Studies class that taught that Muggles are inferior to wizards.
1.1.1.3.12.2. Pro: The Carrow siblings were in charge of discipline at Hogwarts and their detentions included using the Cruciatus Curse on students, and corporal punishment through beatings.
1.1.1.3.12.3. Con: In the Muggle world, oppressive regimes such as North Korea also control their schools in an authoritarian way. This is a feature of dictatorships and not the wizarding world.
1.1.2. Pro: Parents are forced to choose between either home schooling or boarding school for their children. For parents who do not have the necessary knowledge or skills to educate their children this means that they have no choice at all in whether they see their children for the majority of the year.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Muggle-born students are removed from their friends and family and put in a boarding school where their background is looked down upon.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Electricity and other Muggle equipment do not work in Hogwarts therefore extinguishing easy communication between Muggle-born children and their parents.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The wizarding world's methods of communication \(such as owls\) seem largely inferior, or at least more complex, than internet based communications.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Muggle-borns are often treated with disdain and called slanderous names such as 'Mudblood'.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: The oppression faced by Muggle-born wizards is no worse than that faced by many disadvantaged communities in the Muggle world.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: There are epithets in the Muggle world like the N-word in relation to the black community which are similar to 'Mudblood' associated with having a Muggle heritage.
1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: Muggle-borns are rarely called Mudbloods throughout the Harry Potter series.
1.1.2.1.2.3. Con: Those using this word to describe Muggle-borns are usually met with social disgust, much like reactions to those Muggles that use the N-word to describe others of black ancestry.
1.1.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: After inheriting Kreacher, Harry Potter commands the house-elf to not use the word 'Mudblood' in front of the Muggle-born Hermione Granger.
1.1.2.1.2.3.2. Pro: Even in the last moments of his life, Albus Dumbledore reprimands Draco Malfoy for using the term 'Mudblood' in his presence.
1.1.2.1.2.3.3. Pro: When Draco Malfoy called Hermione Granger a Mudblood, he was nearly attacked by several members of the Gryffindor Quidditch team and was nearly cursed by Ronald Weasley.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: Muggle-born students are offered a place at Hogwarts which they may accept or decline as they and their families see fit. Thus, those Muggle-borns who do enrol must be assumed to have done so voluntarily, having judged that the pros of attending a magical boarding school outweigh the cons of leaving their previous day-to-day life.
1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: It seems unlikely that, when presented with the option of learning magic, many 11 year olds would turn down that chance.
1.1.2.1.3.2. Con: At the age of 11, Muggle-borns are below the age of consent and thus cannot properly weigh up the costs and benefits.
1.1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: The parents of the potential Muggle-born students are introduced into the world of magic as well, to help in making the decision to join Hogwarts and the magical world.
1.1.2.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Hermione Granger's parents knew about and endorsed her attendance at Hogwarts.
1.1.2.1.3.2.1.2. Con: Being non-magical, Muggle parents are also in a vulnerable position when taking the decision to send their child to Hogwarts.
1.1.2.1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Muggle Parents are unaware of the dangers studying at Hogwarts poses for their children.
1.1.2.1.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: Muggle parents are unable to comprehend the harms related to the misuse of magic and the Dark Arts.
1.1.2.1.3.2.1.2.3. Pro: Muggle parents have little idea about what life after education at Hogwarts would be like and if that life is what is best for their children.
1.1.2.1.3.2.1.3. Pro: [Special messengers](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Special_messenger) are assigned the post to deliver the acceptance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to Muggle-born people and to explain the existence of magic.
1.1.2.1.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: Severus Snape informed Lily Evans about Hogwarts and told her to expect someone from the school to come by her house to explain to her parents the existence of magic.
1.1.2.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.2.2.1.
1.1.2.1.4. Con: There are wizards from magical bloodlines who see Muggle-borns' backgrounds as fascinating, impressive and/or just as valuable as their own. Examples include Albus Dumbledore, Remus Lupin, Arthur Weasley and Sirius Black.
1.1.2.2. Con: The [Mahoutokoro School](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Mahoutokoro_School_of_Magic) of Japan does not require its younger students to board as it accepts day students from the ages of seven to eleven, though it is required thereafter.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Only those living near the school will have this option.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: The distance from school to home is not a limiting factor to wizarding families as they have access to magical methods of transportation.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Wizards can easily travel across large distances using magical methods of transportation.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [Floo Network](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Floo_Network) connects all the fireplaces in the wizarding world.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Transportation by Floo Powder is much slower than other methods as it requires physical access to a fireplace connected to the rest of the network.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The Floo Network is easily accessible to even untrained wizards or other members of the magical community like Squibs who cannot use magic, as it does not require a license or training to use.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The use of Floo Powder has a very small margin for error and is quite dangerous.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Travelers must keep their elbows tucked in to avoid banging them on the passing fireplaces. Thus, a slight error could cause serious injury.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Travelers also cannot afford to fidget or panic because that could lead to their coming out at the wrong fireplace.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: The name of the destination has to be pronounced perfectly, or else the user could end up at the wrong fireplace.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Harry Potter mispronounces Diagon Alley as 'Diagonally' when using Floo Powder for the first time. He then ends up in the notorious Knockturn Alley.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.4. Pro: [Violet Tillyman](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Violet_Tillyman) was a witch who lived in the 19th century. In 1855, she was deemed to be missing after she left her home via the Floo Network, but failed to reach her intended destination. She resurfaced twenty years later in what came to be known as "the most notorious case of accidental misdirection" in the history of the Floo Network.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.5. Con: Many forms of Muggle transport are dangerous if the user is not careful. Cars can kill in an instant.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The Floo Network can be used to transport children, the elderly and the infirm.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Vanishing Cabinets](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Vanishing_Cabinet) which are made in pairs help users transport themselves across distances by entering one cabinet and exiting through its sister cabinet.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: There is a dangerous aspect to the use of Vanishing Cabinets: if either one of them is broken, the person utilizing them can get stuck in limbo.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Graham Montague](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Graham_Montague) was trapped in a Vanishing Cabinet for a day after he was shoved in by Fred and George; his Apparition out left him disorientated for weeks.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Vanishing Cabinets can penetrate protective enchantments placed around buildings. Even though Hogwarts was fortified to protect its students, Malfoy was able to use a pair of Vanishing Cabinets, one in Borgin and Burkes and the other in the Room of Requirement, to let Death Eaters into Hogwarts.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: [Portkeys](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/portkeys) are regular objects, such as cups or shoes, that have been enchanted in such a way that they take anyone who touches them to a predetermined location.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Portkeys have to be approved by the Ministry of Magic before they can be used.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.3.2. Con: Portkeys carry inherent security risks, since they can be activated by mere touch.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Barty Crouch Jr. bewitches the [Triwizard Cup](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Portkey) to make it a Portkey. When Harry Potter and Cedric Diggory unwittingly touch it, they are transported to a deserted graveyard of Voldemort's choice where Cedric is subsequently murdered, and Harry narrowly escapes the same fate.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Portkeys are not necessarily recognizable as such and can therefore be activated by accident and without intention.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.3.3. Pro: Portkeys are convenient for those who cannot Apparate, who wish to travel by day, and whose destination does not have a fireplace.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.3.4. Con: The sensation of traveling by Portkey is decidedly uncomfortable, and healers recommend that the elderly, pregnant, and infirm avoid them.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: Even though [flying carpets](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Flying_carpet) are now banned in Britain, due to being defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects, they are popular modes of transportation for wizards in other parts of the world.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5. Pro: The wizarding world also takes advantage of magical creatures to help with their transportation needs.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.1. Con: The Ministry of Magic has certain limitations and rules regarding use of magical creatures as a form of transport.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Wizards and witches that live in areas not protected against Muggles are forced by law to perform Disillusionment Charms on their Thestrals regularly.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Keeping a hippogriff is inconvenient as it is [legally required](https://www.pottermore.com/features/pottermore-guide-to-hippogriffs) to cast a Disillusionment Charm daily on it in order to keep it hidden from Muggles.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.1.3. Pro: The International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy [rules out](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hippogriff) the use of hippogriffs for purposes of personal transportation.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.2. Pro: [Thestrals](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Thestral) are horse-like creatures that can be ridden or trained to draw carriages.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Dumbledore's Army rode on thestrals to get to the Ministry of Magic in 1996.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.1.1.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.2.3. Pro: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry use thestral drawn carriages to take their students to school from the train station.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.2.4. Con: Thestrals are particularly difficult to use for transportation as they can only be [seen by those who have been truly touched by death.](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/thestrals) For everyone else, they are invisible.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.2.5. Con: The Ministry of Magic has classified thestrals as "dangerous" so only experienced wizards or witches should handle them.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.2.1.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.2.6. Con: Thestrals are rarely used as methods of transportation due to their reputation as omens of evil and their somewhat dreadful and even distasteful appearance.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.3. Pro: The Beauxbatons Carriage is a light-blue carriage pulled by a dozen winged horses used to transport the staff and students of Beauxbatons Academy of Magic.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.4. Pro: A [hippogriff](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hippogriff) is a magical creature that wizards can train and ride on in a manner similar to how Muggles ride on horses.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.4.1. Pro: Hippogriffs are excellent companions, and are fiercely protective of those who have gained their trust.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Buckbeak attacked Snape to protect Harry during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, and led the Hogwarts thestrals into the Battle of Hogwarts.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.1.2.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.1.3.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.4.4. Con: Hippogriffs are dangerous and difficult to interact with as they have to be dealt with using a particular etiquette.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.4.4.1. Pro: Hippogriffs are very proud creatures and can react violently when they feel offended or disrespected: when Malfoy verbally [insults](https://www.pottermore.com/book-extract-long/draco-malfoy-buckbeak-attack) Buckbeak the Hippogriff, for example, Buckbeak attacks him.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.6. Pro: A common method of transportation for the wizarding community is the use of broomsticks.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.1. Pro: There is even the capacity to play sport on broomsticks as Quidditch is a very popular game.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.2. Con: Travel by broomstick seems very dangerous, as falling off would mean likely death.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.2.1. Con: Much as with motorbikes in the Muggle world, the traveler is unlikely to fall off their broom due to inertia.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.2.2. Con: Trained wizards who travel on broomsticks usually carry their wands and would probably be able to levitate themselves to safety, even on the off chance they did fall off.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.2.2.1. Pro: The [Levitation Charm](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Levitation_Charm) is elementary magic taught to first year students at Hogwarts.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.3. Con: Broomsticks are not feasible as a method of very long-distance travel, since people would become tired, or harmed by lengthy exposure to cold winds.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.3.1. Con: Weather-related issues could easily be alleviated with protective spells.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: The [Atmospheric Charm](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Atmospheric_Charm) can be used to modify the weather.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7. Pro: [Apparition](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Apparition) is the process of teleportation by which one can disappear in one place and appear almost instantaneously at another. Apparition is also free, and therefore accessible.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.1. Con: A wizard Apparating on their own can only travel to a location they have visually seen before, as Apparition requires mentally picturing the desired destination.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.2. Con: Apparition is an advanced skill that can only be completed by fully trained wizards.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.2.1. Pro: Mis-Apparation can lead to [Splinching](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Splinching).
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.2.1.1. Pro: Susan Bones [splinched](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Splinching) herself during her first Apparition lesson, temporarily losing a leg.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.2.1.2. Pro: Ron Weasley was badly injured after splinching away part of his upper arm while side-along apparating from Grimmauld Place.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.2.2. Con: Only short travel distances are necessary to escape danger.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.2.3. Con: Wizards who are too young to Apparate would probably be accompanied most of the time by someone who can Apparate away with them.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.2.3.1. Con: In Britain, a wizard or witch must be at least 17 to have an Apparition license. Many people younger than this don't travel with an adult.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.2.4. Pro: Long-distance Apparition is considered dangerous, thus wizards still rely on other means for inter-continental travel.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.2.4.1. Con: It is still incredibly convenient to be able to Apparate anywhere within a country.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.3. Con: An Anti-Apparition Charm can be used to make it impossible for Apparition to occur in certain places, as is the case with Hogwarts.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.3.1. Con: Hogwarts is a generally safe environment; Apparition is possible in most environments that contain potential dangers.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.2.1.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.8. Con: Most forms of transportation are regulated and supervised by [The Department of Magical Transportation](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_Magical_Transportation) which fines witches and wizards who transgress the rules.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.8.1. Con: This is no different to the Muggle systems of transportation, which are also governed by rules and potential punishments.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.9. Pro: A lot of wizarding transportation options are magical improvements on Muggle transportation systems.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.9.1. Pro: Cars and motorcycles can be magically altered to suit the needs of the magical community.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.9.1.1. Pro: The Ministry of Magic has cars that look like exactly like Muggle cars but are enchanted to accommodate a much larger number of people.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.9.1.2. Pro: Sirius Black enchanted a motorcycle with a sidecar to make it fly and then used it extensively. It was then handed over to Hagrid.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.9.1.3. Pro: Arthur Weasley enchanted a Ford Anglia to make it fly.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.9.2. Pro: [Magical boats](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-great-lake) can take magical shortcuts to other waterways. For example, the Durmstrang Ship, which is a magical ship that can travel underwater, is used by the Durmstrang Institute to transport its staff and students. It appears from the depths of Hogwarts lake, even though the lake is not physically connected to other seas or rivers.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1.9.3. Pro: The [Knight Bus](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Knight_Bus) is an enchanted bus system that helps transport stranded members of the magical community across different parts of Britain.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: Eleven is still a young age to be separated from one's family.
1.1.3. Con: You get to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and learn magic.
1.1.3.1. Con: Not everyone goes to Hogwarts or similar schools.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: There are a number of other [wizarding schools](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wizarding_school) throughout the world.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Most countries in the world do not have their own [wizarding school.](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wizarding_school)
1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: The wizarding population is small and likely does not have the demand for more schools than already exist.
1.1.3.1.2.2. Con: The many easy methods of travel within the wizarding world makes it easy for students to attend schools in other countries, if their country does not have one of its own.
1.1.3.1.2.2.1. Con: There's a whole host of things you have to consider while sending your child abroad such as your child being in an alien environment, cultural differences between the populations and the difficulty you would face in keeping in touch with your child's life. Therefore it is unlikely that just because travel arrangements can be more easily made, that wizarding parents would be more likely to send their young children across the world for education.
1.1.3.1.2.3. Pro: There are only [eleven](https://www.pottermore.com/collection/wizarding-schools) established wizarding schools throughout the world.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: [Hogwarts](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry) only accepts students from the UK and Ireland.
1.1.3.2. Pro: The Hogwarts curriculum emphasizes putting textbook knowledge into practice. Students routinely transform objects in Transfiguration, brew potions and learn defenses against Dark spells and Dark creatures. They also have to demonstrate their practical abilities to earn good grades in the OWLs and NEWTs.
1.1.3.3. Pro: At Hogwarts your magical education is fully funded by the Ministry of Magic.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: You still need to buy books, robes, a wand and equipment \(quill, parchment, cauldron\) to go to Hogwarts.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Though [familiars](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/familiars) are optional to bring to Hogwarts, many students appear to have one, and as such many students may feel like they too must buy one in order to fit in.
1.1.3.3.1.2. Con: This is also true in the Muggle world where students are required to pay for supplies and uniforms even if tuition itself is free.
1.1.3.4. Pro: You can also do exchange programs with wizarding schools around the world, such as [Castelobruxo](https://www.pottermore.com/collection-episodic/wizarding-schools) in Brazil.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: Exchange programs are also available in the Muggle world and are more ubiquitous as there are more schools to go to.
1.1.3.5. Con: The flipside is that Hogwarts becomes a de-facto prison which cannot be left without explicit permission and usually only to visit Hogsmeade for a few hours.
1.1.3.5.1. Con: Many Muggle boarding schools also don't allow students to leave the premises without permission during the school term for reasons of safety and liability.
1.1.3.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.1.
1.1.4. Con: While the system could benefit from diversification, it seems to produce functional, reasonably well-adapted citizens of the community which it serves.
1.2. Con: The wizarding world is socially regressive.
1.2.1. Pro: Love and relationships are treated in a backwards and narrow-minded manner.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Only heterosexual sexuality appears to be acknowledged in the wizarding world.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: There appear to be few, if any, openly homosexual or bisexual wizards.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Although Albus Dumbledore was believed to be gay, he was never open about his sexuality.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This may be because he fell in love with Grindelwald who turned out to be a feared Dark Wizard, not because of a stigma against homosexuality.
1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: This may have been because of his position as a Headmaster, and the narrative point of view was that of a student. Most discussion of his sexuality to Harry Potter would have been inappropriate in a school setting.
1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Dumbledore often broke the boundaries of a typical student-professor relationship with Harry, and had many conversations with him about the concept and nature of love. To speak of his sexuality would not have been dissimilar to those types of conversation.
1.2.1.1.1.1.3. Con: He is gay; it was confirmed by JK Rowling in many interviews and in meetings with the production team on the HP films. He also didn't need to be open about his sexuality, as he was very comfortable with it, and didn't feel the need to discuss it, showing the very comfortable status of LGBT+ people in the HP universe.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: Hogwarts [is known to be](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/544998416414412801?lang=en) a "safe space" for LGBT students. This implies that a variety of sexual orientations are acknowledged and accepted there.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Even if it is described as a safe space, the fact that all relationships seem heteronormative suggests that LGBT students might not feel that safe.
1.2.1.1.3. Con: The wizarding world that we see is from a cis white hetero male in the 20th century, there may be a large LGBTQ+ community that is not visible or seen to be relevant to this perspective.
1.2.1.2. Pro: The gathering of experience with multiple partners - "relationship shopping" - is apparently not common.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Some members of the magical community never move beyond their first love even after things do not work out, for example Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Muggles can also find it difficult or impossible to get over their first love.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Many marriages evolve out of the partners' first serious relationship, for example those of Harry and Ron as well as their respective parents.
1.2.1.2.3. Pro: Many wizarding couples marry at a young age.
1.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: Lily and James Potter married at eighteen and had their son, Harry, at the age of twenty.
1.2.1.2.3.2. Pro: Molly and Arthur Weasley were married before the age of twenty and had their first child by the age of twenty-one.
1.2.1.2.3.3. Con: Remus Lupin was thirty-seven when he married Nymphadora Tonks.
1.2.1.2.3.3.1. Con: However, Nymphadora Tonks was twenty-four when she got married.
1.2.1.2.3.3.2. Con: Remus Lupin had to wait much longer than others to find a suitable relationship because of the social stigma and physical dangers associated with his being a werewolf.
1.2.1.2.3.4. Pro: Fleur Delacour was twenty when she married Bill Weasley.
1.2.1.2.3.5. Con: Most wizards and witches only rushed into marriage after the First Wizarding War in the worry that they may not be able to do it in the near future lest they were killed, as mentioned by Molly Weasley. This may not have been the norm in normal times.
1.2.1.2.3.6. Pro: Harry Potter, Ginny Weasley, Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley and Draco Malfoy got married in their early 20s or before that.
1.2.1.2.4. Con: Given that many of these relationships seem to be successful in the long term \(Hermione and Ron, Harry and Ginny\), this is not necessarily a negative thing.
1.2.1.2.4.1. Pro: Many Muggles switch partners regularly without finding someone they wish to remain with long-term.
1.2.1.2.4.2. Pro: At least anecdotally, divorces and unsuccessful marriages seem to be rare in the wizarding world.
1.2.1.2.4.2.1. Con: Low divorce rates are not necessarily a sign of healthy relationships. It is equally plausible that marriage laws are conservative and keep failing marriages together.
1.2.1.2.5. Con: This is not necessarily something that is discouraged in the Muggle world either, with people who remain with and marry their 'high school sweethearts' or first partner are often idealised and seen as romantic.
1.2.1.2.6. Con: Ginny Weasley dated Michael Corner and Dean Thomas before Harry Potter. Harry had a crush on Cho Chang and briefly dated her before Ginny.
1.2.1.2.7. Con: Ronald Weasley dated Lavender Brown before getting together with Hermione Granger. Hermione Granger briefly dated Victor Krum before Ron.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Inbreeding with pure-bloods is a common practice for elite wizarding families wanting to uphold the tradition of marrying only wizards of respected ancestry.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: Since a person's ancestry is not relevant in determining substantive features about that person, the fact that pure-bloods breed with each other doesn't actually decrease the diversity of the wizarding world.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Pure-bloods who marry non-pure-bloods are often [disowned](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Marriage) by their families.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: [Andromeda Tonks](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Andromeda_Tonks) was disowned by the Black family for marrying Ted Tonks.
1.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: [Merope Gaunt](https://www.pottermore.com/features/the-sad-history-of-merope-gaunt) married Tom Riddle Sr. and was disowned.
1.2.1.3.2.3. Pro: A member of the family was blasted off the Black Family tree for marrying a Weasley - a family renowned for being blood traitors.
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: The Black, Malfoy, Lestrange and Gaunt families were all notorious for inbreeding among cousins and other relatives.
1.2.1.3.3.1. Con: The Malfoy family is known for [marrying outside](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-malfoy-family) the pure-blood circle for the purposes of social advancement and to keep their blood from becoming enfeebled or unstable, unlike the Gaunts and Lestranges.
1.2.1.3.4. Con: This is not that different from the deliberate or circumstantial associative mating patterns of the [Muggle world](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/upshot/marriages-of-power-couples-reinforce-income-inequality.html).
1.2.1.3.4.1. Pro: There are many Muggle cultures and communities in which [cousin marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage) is considered ideal and actively encouraged.
1.2.1.4. Con: There are many people in the Muggle community who still hold narrow-minded views about love, believing that marriage should only be for heterosexual couples or that individuals should abstain from sex until marriage, so this is not unique to the wizarding world.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: Same-sex sexual contact is a criminal offence in a total of [74 countries](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/gay-lesbian-bisexual-relationships-illegal-in-74-countries-a7033666.html) in the Muggle world.
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Fornication is illegal in [13 countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornication) in the Muggle world.
1.2.2. Con: The wizarding community is just as gender diverse as the Muggle community, yet there seem to be comparatively fewer gender inequalities and instances of structural sexism.
1.2.2.1. Con: Even if the wizarding world lacks the traditional forms of prejudice that are features of the Muggle world, the wizarding world has its own \(often stronger\) prejudices.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The wizarding world is very exclusive and sometimes treats those who are not a part of it very cruelly.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: There are laws which protect Muggles against cruelty by wizards.
1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: [The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Misuse_of_Muggle_Artefacts_Office) department was created at the Ministry of Magic to regulate the use of magic on Muggle objects and to try to keep items that had been bewitched away from Muggles.
1.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Wizards found in breach of these laws are dealt with severely, often being sentenced to Azkaban.
1.2.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: The Muggle Protection Act, partially written by Arthur Weasley, is a Ministry of Magic by-law that was designed to protect Muggles from potentially harmful magical artifacts.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Many Death Eaters view harming Muggles as a form of sport.
1.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.1.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2. Con: The Death Eaters by no means represent the mainstream or the majority of the wizarding world. They acted against the law and were accordingly hunted down.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1. Con: While this is true, the Death Eaters merely represented the most extreme faction of a conservative group. While others may not have gone to the extent of committing violence against Muggles, it does not mean they did not hold these latent prejudices.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Racism exists within the wizarding world based on purity of blood.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Squibs, non-magical people with at least one magical parent, are looked upon with a degree of disdain by some witches and wizards.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: Many witches and wizards who believe in the importance of blood purity consider half-bloods to be inferior because of their Muggle heritage.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.4. Pro: For a long time, policies and attitudes reflected the view that pure-blood wizards and witches were superior to Muggle-borns or half-bloods.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: Using falsified research done in the Department of Mysteries, the Ministry claimed that Muggle-borns "stole" their magic from "real" witches and wizards. As a result, the Muggle-born Registration Commission was set up to persecute and imprison Muggle-borns.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.4.1.1. Con: The period of stringent government policy during the Second Wizarding War is understood to be an aberration rather than the norm.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: The Snatchers, an organisation of Dark wizards who acted as bounty hunters, was formed to round up any Muggle-borns or blood traitors on the run.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.2.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.4.4. Pro: It was not until Hermione Granger became a high ranking member of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, in the early 2000s, that pro-pure-blood laws were eliminated.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Even the Minister for Magic, [Cornelius Fudge](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge), favoured pure-bloods and showed little respect for Squibs and 'half-breeds'.
1.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: The wizarding world is often classist, xenophobic, racist, and ableist.
1.2.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.
1.2.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: Many creatures are actively discriminated against and treated as second-class citizens by the magical community despite having their own magic and/or near-human intelligence.
1.2.2.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Half-giants are looked down upon as outcasts of society despite having magical blood and the ability to produce magic.
1.2.2.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Throughout history, Ministry of Magic policies regarding werewolves have been ineffective in curbing the spread of [lycanthropy](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/werewolves) or challenging the stigma associated with being a werewolf.
1.2.2.1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Muggles who suffer from chronic Muggle illnesses, like [HIV/AIDS](https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-social-issues/stigma-discrimination), face similar discrimination in the Muggle world.
1.2.2.1.1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Those identified as werewolves, like Remus Lupin, face prejudice and often have a hard time keeping a job.
1.2.2.1.1.3.2.3. Pro: House-elves, despite their capacity for magic and strong intellect, have long been enslaved to the whims of their wizarding masters.
1.2.2.1.1.3.2.4. Pro: Despite possessing human intelligence, centaurs are classified as Beasts by the Ministry of Magic.
1.2.2.1.1.3.2.4.1. Con: Centaurs are classified as Beasts by the Ministry of Magic [at their own request](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Centaur), as they were unhappy at having to share Being status with hags and vampires.
1.2.2.1.1.3.2.5. Pro: Goblins are considered to be inferior by many wizards even though they are highly intelligent and have the ability to use magic.
1.2.2.1.1.3.2.5.1. Pro: Despite their intelligence and skill they are labelled 'creatures' by the Ministry. They are represented by the Goblin Liaison Office of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures in the Ministry of Magic.
1.2.2.1.1.3.2.5.2. Pro: Goblin political leaders have been given rude nicknames such as "Bodrod the Bearded" and "Urg the Unclean" by the wizarding community. This is clear indication that they are disrespected by witches and wizards.
1.2.2.1.1.3.2.5.3. Con: Since Goblins are in charge of the only wizarding bank, Gringotts, they are responsible for maintaining the entire wizarding economy. This makes them trusted members of the magical community.
1.2.2.1.1.3.2.5.4. Pro: Acts of oppression perpetrated on Goblins, such as the lack of goblin representation on the Wizengamot, attempts to enslave goblins as house-elves, stripping of wand privileges, wizard attempts to control Gringotts, or the brutal goblin slayings prompted several Goblin Rebellions throughout history.
1.2.2.1.1.3.3. Pro: The Weasleys are mocked for being poor.
1.2.2.1.1.3.3.1. Con: This is localised to certain segments of society, much as it is in the Muggle world.
1.2.2.1.1.3.4. Con: Racism and oppression exist in the Muggle world to the same extent as they do in the wizarding world.
1.2.2.1.1.4. Pro: [Rappaport's Law](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/rappaports-law-en) completely separated the wizarding world in the U.S. from No-Maj \(Muggle\) communities. Wizards could not befriend or marry No-Majs, penalties for fraternization were harsh, and communication was limited to what was necessary for daily activities.
1.2.2.1.1.4.1. Con: [Rappaport's Law](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/rappaports-law-en) was necessary for security reasons because it followed one of the most serious breaches of the International Statute of Secrecy, a breach that came from inside [MACUSA](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/macusa) \(the Magical Congress of the United States of America\).
1.2.2.1.1.4.2. Pro: [Rappaport's Law](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/rappaports-law-en) pushed the wizarding community deeper underground and caused No-Majs to be regarded as the enemy.
1.2.2.1.1.4.3. Con: Rappaport's Law was repealed in 1965 when it was determined that a credible threat to the secrecy of the wizarding community no longer existed.
1.2.2.1.1.4.4. Pro: Implementation of the law led to the widening of the cultural divide between the wizarding communities of the United States and Europe where wizarding governments clandestinely cooperated and communicated with their Muggle counterparts, and witches and wizards were free to marry and befriend Muggles.
1.2.2.1.1.4.5. Con: Since the law also required all wizards in America to apply for and carry a wand permit, it became easier to keep track of magical activity and of wizards who used magic against the limits set by the law.
1.2.2.1.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.3.4.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.
1.2.2.2. Con: Some patriarchal structures still seem to exist in the wizarding world. For example, family structures still suggest women are the homemakers, while the men are the breadwinners.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Women are not only represented in the traditional roles of schoolgirls, mothers, and teachers but also in more non-traditional roles.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: There are also female [healers](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Healers).
1.2.2.2.1.2. Con: The question is not whether there are some women in non-traditional roles but whether, on the whole, traditional roles dominate. These examples seem to be the exception rather than the rule.
1.2.2.2.1.3. Pro: Witches are often seen as sports heroes.
1.2.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: Quidditch is the most popular sport in the wizarding world and women play on the teams that compete for the Quidditch World Cup and at Hogwarts.
1.2.2.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: The [Holyhead Harpies](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Holyhead_Harpies) is an all-female Quidditch team that plays in the British and Irish Quidditch League.
1.2.2.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: [Moran](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Moran) and [Mullet](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Mullet), the Irish Chasers that impressed Harry Potter at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup with their coordinated movements, were witches.
1.2.2.2.1.3.1.3. Pro: Angelina Johnson, Katie Bell and Ginny Weasley were all key players for the Gryffindor Quidditch team at Hogwarts.
1.2.2.2.1.3.1.4. Pro: It can be assumed that the captains select these female players based on merit alone rather than some school gender policy as the Slytherin team is permitted to play without any witches on their team.
1.2.2.2.1.3.1.5. Pro: Female players are also given the opportunity to captain Quidditch teams, as [Angelina Johnson](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Quidditch_Captain) was in her final year at Hogwarts.
1.2.2.2.1.4. Pro: Many books that are taught at Hogwarts, such as The Standard Book of Spells by Miranda Goshawk and A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot, are written by witches.
1.2.2.2.1.5. Pro: Hogwarts was founded in the 10th century by two wizards and two witches. The four founders were highly regarded as the most brilliant witches and wizards of the time.
1.2.2.2.1.6. Pro: Many witches are employed at the Ministry of Magic and hold important jobs.
1.2.2.2.1.6.1. Pro: [Hermione Granger](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hermione_Granger) became the Minister for Magic after serving as the Deputy Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and working at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.
1.2.2.2.1.6.2. Pro: [Dolores Umbridge](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge) served as the Head of the Improper Use of Magic Office and Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic.
1.2.2.2.1.6.3. Pro: [Mafalda Hopkirk](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Mafalda_Hopkirk) worked in the Improper Use of Magic Office and was responsible for the important task of sending out warnings when magic was used by underage wizards or witches.
1.2.2.2.1.6.4. Pro: Women such as [Nymphadora Tonks](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks) have been aurors.
1.2.2.2.1.6.5. Pro: [Amelia Susan Bones](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Amelia_Bones) was the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and had a seat on the Wizengamot.
1.2.2.2.1.7. Pro: Two of the four heads of houses at Hogwarts, [Minerva Mcgonagall](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall) and [Pomona Sprout](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Pomona_Sprout), are accomplished women.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: This appears to change over time, as in the Muggle world. Both Ginny Weasley and Hermione Granger have successful careers as well as raising children.
1.2.2.2.3. Pro: When Harry, Ron and Hermione are searching for Horcruxes, Hermione complains that she is always left to sort the food and suggests it is because she is a girl.
1.2.2.2.3.1. Con: Ron denies the accuracy of this suggestion by claiming the reason she is left to sort the food is because she is the best with magic and therefore the most likely to be able to magically turn their ingredients into something edible.
1.2.2.2.4. Pro: Narcissa Malfoy, Molly Weasley and Lily Potter are all stay-at-home mothers while their husbands work. Comparatively, witches who are career focused are often childless e.g. Minerva McGonagall and Dolores Umbridge.
1.2.2.2.4.1. Con: Molly Weasley takes a more active and assertive role at the Order Headquarters when the battle against Lord Voldemort becomes more overt. It is possible that she chose to be a stay-at-home mother.
1.2.2.2.4.2. Con: [Alice Longbottom](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Alice_Longbottom) was an accomplished Auror and a family woman.
1.2.2.2.4.3. Pro: Additionally, these mothers \(more so than their husbands\) fit the stereotype of being highly protective of and absolutely devoted to their children, even in war and into death.
1.2.2.2.4.3.1. Pro: Molly Weasley dueled and killed Bellatrix Lestrange after the latter's killing curse narrowly missed Molly's daughter, Ginny.
1.2.2.2.4.3.1.1. Con: The devotion seen here is not unique to women, Harry has a similar reaction following the death of Sirius.
1.2.2.2.4.3.1.2. Con: If anything, this opposes the notion of patriarchal structures as women are seen as equally prevalent in combat.
1.2.2.2.4.3.2. Con: This could be a function of the love the parents have for their children, not because of set stereotypes.
1.2.2.2.4.3.2.1. Con: While Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy appear to love their children, it is their wives who display the most willingness to risk their own safety for that of their children.
1.2.2.2.4.3.2.1.1. Con: Arthur Weasley risked his life for the safety or betterment of his family on a number of occasions.
1.2.2.2.4.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Arthur Weasley risked his life on guard duty at the Department of Mysteries trying to protect the prophecy.
1.2.2.2.4.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: Arthur Weasley was one of the guard members attacked during the Battle of the Seven Potters. He was in charge of his son Fred's safety during the battle.
1.2.2.2.4.3.2.1.1.3. Pro: Arthur Weasley fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower as well as the Second Battle of Hogwarts that threatened the safety of his entire family and the wizarding world at large.
1.2.2.2.4.3.2.1.1.4. Con: Most of Arthur Weasley's bravery came when he was working for the Order of the Phoenix, not in the direct protection of his children.
1.2.2.2.4.3.2.1.1.4.1. Con: The tasks Arthur Weasley performed on behalf of the Order were not only dangerous but also actively undermined the activity of Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters who posed an existential threat to the entire wizarding world including all members of the Weasley family.
1.2.2.2.4.3.2.1.2. Pro: During the battle of Hogwarts, Narcissa Malfoy risked lying to Lord Voldemort in front of the Death Eaters about Harry's death when she found out from Harry that Draco was alive.
1.2.2.2.4.3.2.1.3. Pro: Narcissa Malfoy defied Voldemort's orders and sought Snape's help when Draco was given the task of assassinating Albus Dumbledore.
1.2.2.2.4.3.3. Pro: The dynamics in Voldemort's attack on the Potter household are heavily gendered. James, the male, goes to fight him off and protect Lily and Harry, and it is only after James is killed that Lily is put in danger.
1.2.2.2.4.3.4. Pro: While Tonks was criticised for leaving Teddy to fight in the Battle, no one criticised her husband Lupin, who also left his son to participate, despite the fact that Tonks was an Auror and so particularly trained for this situation.
1.2.2.2.4.4. Con: Most male professors, like Horace Slughorn, Severus Snape and Rubeus Hagrid, are also childless.
1.2.2.2.4.5. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.2.
1.2.2.2.4.6. Pro: This suggests there are still limits on what witches are able to achieve, and possibly prejudices and stereotypes that make them choose between family and career.
1.2.2.2.4.6.1. Con: Women like Professor McGonagall and Sprout show that women don’t have to conform to patriarchal expectation of tending to a family to be considered reputable in the wizarding world.
1.2.2.2.5. Pro: The women always appear to take their husband's name when they marry. This suggests many patriarchal structures still exist, even if witches have more opportunities than Muggle women.
1.2.2.2.5.1. Con: Hermione Granger appears to keep her own surname after her marriage to Ron Weasley, with the pair's childrens' surname being [Granger-Weasley](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Rose_Granger-Weasley).
1.2.2.2.5.1.1. Con: This is an exceptional circumstance and not the norm at all in the wizarding world.
1.2.2.2.5.2. Con: This was true during Harry Potter's adolescence in the 90's, when most Muggles did the same. Things have changed in the Muggle world and may well have done so in the wizarding world.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry embodies the gender inclusive nature of its name.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: When older students select their courses, witches are never steered toward Charms \(which would presumably aid in housekeeping\) and wizards are allowed to drop Defence Against the Dark Arts, as they are not automatically expected to fulfill the roles of protectors.
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: Hogwarts clubs are highly inclusive.
1.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: Dumbledore’s Army, the secret organization that Harry Potter found to help students develop their dueling techniques, consisted of almost 50 percent female members.
1.2.2.3.2.1.1. Con: Dumbledore's Army was not in a position to exclude any members because they ran the risk of Dolores Umbridge finding out about them if they excluded people.
1.2.2.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.3.1.
1.2.2.3.3. Con: Boys are prevented from visiting the girls’ dormitories due to an enchantment placed on the staircase but girls are not prevented from visiting the boys'. This is because the Hogwarts founders believed that girls are more trustworthy than boys and shows that gender stereotyping exists at Hogwarts.
1.2.2.3.4. Pro: Female students at Hogwarts appear to be treated equally and afforded equal opportunities. A number of those students, including Hermione Granger and Luna Lovegood, played important roles in defeating Voldemort.
1.2.2.3.4.1. Pro: There is a male and female prefect chosen from each house at Hogwarts in the fifth year based on merit.
1.2.2.3.4.2. Pro: A Head Boy and a Head Girl are chosen from the seventh year students at Hogwarts.
1.2.2.3.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.3.1.
1.2.2.3.4.4. Pro: Hogwarts was built as a school to train both [witches and wizards](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/121598/have-men-and-women-in-the-wizarding-world-always-had-relatively-equal-rights), even though in medieval England women were highly unlikely to receive even basic education.
1.2.2.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.5.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Females are as included in combat as men. Nymphadora Tonks, Molly Weasley, Bellatrix Lestrange and many others are skilled at dueling.
1.2.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.4.
1.2.2.6. Pro: Among the 12 original aurors of the [MACUSA](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America) in the late 17th century, a number were female which was significant compared to No-Maj female representation of the time.
1.2.2.7. Pro: The first female Minister for Magic was elected in 1798 and there have been a number since. This is comparatively early progress when considering positions of power held by women in the Muggle world.
1.2.2.7.1. Pro: The first female Prime Minister of Britain was elected 177 years later, in 1975.
1.2.2.7.2. Pro: At this time, Muggle women had significantly fewer rights and were not yet able to vote.
1.2.2.8. Con: It is not clear that the wizarding community actually is as gender diverse as the Muggle community, with no examples of gender fluid or transgender wizards or witches.
1.2.2.8.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.
1.2.2.9. Pro: It is never substantiated that magic — unlike say physical strength — is a power that witches have less access to than men. Given that magic is the key to success in the wizarding world it seems to have helped level the playing field between genders.
1.2.3. Con: The wizarding world does not seem to have widespread religions, so it lacks the primary source of social conservatism in the Muggle world.
1.2.3.1. Con: Christianity appears to be present in the British wizarding world.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Christmas and Easter appear to be celebrated by most wizards.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Hogwarts has a Christmas and Easter break.
1.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: Molly Weasley gifts homemade chocolate eggs for Easter.
1.2.3.1.1.3. Pro: Wizards exchange Christmas presents.
1.2.3.1.1.4. Con: Many Muggles celebrate Christmas and Easter without being explicitly Christian, as these holidays have become more universal.
1.2.3.1.1.4.1. Con: The celebration of Christmas and Easter on a societal level exists only in societies where that religion is dominant. It is not seen across the non-Christian world.
1.2.3.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Christianity is the [dominant religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom) in Britain, which is why its holidays are celebrated widely there.
1.2.3.1.1.4.2. Pro: Judeo-Christian norms dominate a lot of countries around the world, and a lot of Christian festivals are sanctioned holidays in many parts of the Muggle world. As such, non-Christians also celebrate these festivals.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Some wizards follow the Christian tradition of establishing godparents for their children.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: Sirius Black was Harry Potter's godfather.
1.2.3.1.2.2. Pro: Harry Potter is Teddy Lupin's godfather.
1.2.3.1.3. Pro: Many wizards follow Christian burial traditions.
1.2.3.1.3.1. Pro: Harry Potter carved a cross into the tree under which he buried Mad-Eye Moody's eye.
1.2.3.1.3.2. Pro: Many wizards are buried in the [Parish Church of St Clementine graveyard](http://potter-encyclopaedia.wikia.com/wiki/Parish_Graveyard_of_St_Clementine).
1.2.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: Most churches only allow members of the church to be buried in their cemetery, suggesting that the wizards buried there were practicing Christians.
1.2.3.1.3.2.2. Pro: Lily and James Potter are buried here, as are Ariana and Kendra Dumbledore, and Ignotus Peverell.
1.2.3.1.3.3. Pro: The inscriptions on some notable tombstones allude to the Bible.
1.2.3.1.3.3.1. Pro: The tombstone of Lily and James Potter alludes to [Corinthians 15:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+15%3A26).
1.2.3.1.3.3.2. Pro: The tombstone of Ariana and Kendra Dumbledore alludes to [Matthew 6:21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_6:21).
1.2.3.1.4. Pro: Many notable wizards have explicit connections to Christianity.
1.2.3.1.4.1. Pro: Albus Dumbledore [owned](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Bible) a Christian Bible.
1.2.3.1.4.2. Pro: Minerva McGonagall's father was a Presbyterian Minister.
1.2.3.1.4.3. Pro: The [Fat Friar](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Fat_Friar) was a Roman Catholic Friar while alive.
1.2.3.1.5. Con: While many Christian traditions may be observed in the wizarding world, these appear to be the more universal traditions such as holidays, which are no longer exclusively Christian.
1.2.3.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.4.
1.2.3.1.6. Con: There is little evidence that wizards attend church services or follow religious texts.
1.2.3.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.4.1.
1.2.3.1.7. Con: The influence of Christianity on the wizarding world is expected given their relationship with the Muggle world. It is not a sign that people themselves are religious.
1.2.3.2. Con: Rowling has stated that Hogwarts was a [multifaith school](http://www.mtv.com/news/1572107/harry-potter-author-jk-rowling-opens-up-about-books-christian-imagery/), suggesting that wizards do in fact practice a number of religions.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Even if some wizards are nominally religious, religion does not seem to be a large part of wizarding life, institutions, or morality.
1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.2.5. Con: Even if the wizarding world lags slightly behind the Muggle world, it is possible that the wizarding world will follow in the trend of rapid social liberalisation that the Muggle world has recently experienced.
1.2.5.1. Con: The rapid social liberalisation of the Muggle world was the result of a groundswell of activism in these areas over a number of years. There does not seem to be any similar trend in the wizarding world.
1.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.2.7. Con: Social conservatism is not inherently undesirable; many Muggles would find this an appealing aspect of the wizarding world.
1.2.7.1. Con: Conservative Muggles living in liberal societies at least have the option of moving to more conservative societies. Liberal wizards, should they wish to remain living in the wizarding world, have no choice other than to live in a conservative society.
1.3. Pro: Magic opens a lot of interesting possibilities.
1.3.1. Pro: There are a number of magical enhancements wizards can use to breathe under water.
1.3.1.1. Pro: The [Bubble-Head Charm](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/g00/wiki/Bubble-Head_Charm?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) is the most effective spell for breathing underwater allowing one a supply of oxygen.
1.3.1.2. Pro: A [Scuba-Spell](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/g00/wiki/Scuba-Spell?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) is an Underwater Charm used to breathe underwater in lieu of using underwater breathing apparatus.
1.3.1.3. Pro: [Gillyweed](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/g00/wiki/Gillyweed?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) is a magical plant. When it is eaten, one grows gills and webbing between the fingers and toes, allowing one to process oxygen from water and navigate underwater more easily.
1.3.1.4. Con: Muggles can also use scuba equipment or submarines to explore underwater and these technologies are safer than the wizarding methods.
1.3.2. Pro: It is a lot easier to design a private space for oneself without being detected or overheard using magic.
1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.3.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The [Imperturbable Charm](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Imperturbable_Charm) is a spell that creates a magical barrier on a target object, such as a door, to protect it from eavesdropping.
1.3.2.3. Pro: The [Fidelius Charm](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Fidelius_Charm) can be used to make a location invisible, intangible, unplottable and soundproof.
1.3.2.4. Pro: [Cave inimicum](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/g00/wiki/Cave_inimicum?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) is the incantation of a protective spell that conjures up a shield that keeps the caster hidden from others. Those who are on the other side of the shield will not be able to see them, hear them or, if the spell is well-casted, smell them.
1.3.2.5. Pro: [The Disillusionment Charm](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Disillusionment_Charm) is a spell that is used to conceal the target which takes on the colour and texture of its surroundings.
1.3.2.6. Pro: [Muffliato](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Muffliato_Charm) is a charm used to fill the ears of any person in the vicinity of the caster with an unidentifiable buzzing sound so as to allow conversing without being overheard.
1.3.3. Con: The Muggle world has many forms of entertainment which the wizarding world lacks.
1.3.3.1. Pro: The Muggle world has films, TV shows, the internet, and computer games.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Many computer games and entertainment media allow Muggles to watch or emulate fictional magic. The ability to perform real magic would be far more exciting.
1.3.3.2. Pro: The Muggle world has a large diversity of sports.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Quidditch seems to be the only popular sport in the wizarding world: this is highly limiting to wizards and witches interested in sport.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: This is especially true for those witches and wizards who want a sport that is safe.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1. Con: There is wizarding chess and gobstones for those who want an alternative to Quidditch.
1.3.3.3. Con: It is not impossible in the wizarding world to use muggle entertainment.
1.3.4. Pro: There are a number of mythical creatures which live in the wizarding world.
1.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.5.4.
1.3.4.2. Con: While more creatures might be present in the wizarding world, wizards lack the complex Muggle technology that allows Muggles to investigate the biology and history of interesting creatures.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: The fact that there are antivenoms to most known poisons, Healing spells and potions to treat most diseases and intensive study in Herbology in schools indicates that there is research done in the wizarding world. It is just conducted in a manner different to that in the Muggle World.
1.3.4.3. Pro: While quite dangerous, dragons exist in the wild.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: Dragons are usually ill-tempered and can kill a person instantly.
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: Dragon bodyparts \(such as powdered horn and organs\) are important for potions, dragon heartstrings are used by Ollivander for wand cores, and there are twelve uses for dragon blood \(including oven cleaner\).
1.3.4.4. Con: Some of the magical creatures are awful and undesirable.
1.3.4.4.1. Con: The wizarding world has developed various techniques for protecting against and isolating dangerous magical creatures.
1.3.4.4.2. Pro: The [manticore](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Manticore) is one of the wizarding world's most dangerous creatures. It has a human-like head, a lion's body, and a scorpion's tail with a stinger that causes instant death. A manticore's skin repels all known charms, so it is effectively hard to subdue a manticore with magic.
1.3.4.4.2.1. Con: Rubeus Hagrid managed to get manticores and fire crabs to breed, indicating that it is possible to keep oneself safe while interacting with them.
1.3.4.4.3. Pro: The [fire crab](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Fire_crab) is a large, turtle-like crab creature native to Fiji that is highly dangerous.
1.3.4.4.3.1. Pro: They are able to defend themselves by shooting flames from their rear ends when threatened.
1.3.4.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.4.2.1.
1.3.4.4.4. Pro: The [Basilisk](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Basilisk) is a giant serpent, also known as the King of Serpents. It is a creature bred by dark wizards.
1.3.4.4.4.1. Pro: Looking a Basilisk directly in the eye immediately kills the victim, while indirect contact leaves them in a state of [paralysis](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Petrification).
1.3.4.4.4.2. Pro: Basilisk venom is so powerful that it can kill a person within minutes, making the person drowsy and blurry-visioned before they die. It has a very long lasting effect which still remains potent even up to five years or more after the snake has died.
1.3.4.4.4.3. Pro: It is far too easy to breed a Basilisk: you simply hatch a chicken egg from beneath a toad.
1.3.4.4.4.3.1. Con: Given how rare they are, it may not be that easy to breed Basilisks.
1.3.4.4.5. Con: There are many non-magical creatures that are dangerous and [life-threatening](http://www.conservationinstitute.org/top-10-dangerous-animals-in-the-world/), but we still respect them as essential elements of the natural environment.
1.3.4.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.5.2.1.
1.3.4.4.7. Pro: Mountain trolls are strong, unpredictable, violent, and stupid.
1.3.4.4.8. Pro: Acromantulas are giant spiders that are intelligent and highly dangerous.
1.3.4.4.8.1. Pro: Acromantulas have been known to eat people.
1.3.4.4.8.1.1. Pro: Aragog's colony tried to eat Ron and Harry in their second year.
1.3.4.4.8.1.2. Pro: Despite Hagrid's close bond with Aragog, the colony [tried to eat Hagrid](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Acromantula) as soon as Aragog died.
1.3.4.4.9. Con: Most of the awful and undesirable creatures are rare or can easily be avoided; they tend not to live in areas where people live.
1.3.4.4.10. Pro: A [Non-Human Spiritous Apparition](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Non-Human_Spiritous_Apparition) \(a non-being\) is a type of magical creature that is created from and sustained by human emotions and is a mystery even to wizards. Being amortal, they are not born and cannot be truly killed.
1.3.4.4.10.1. Pro: A [poltergeist](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Poltergeist) is a non-being that does not have a physical form and haunts one specific location at time. They delight in vandalism, malicious mischief, and the general aggravation and embarrassment of living persons.
1.3.4.4.10.2. Pro: [Boggarts](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Boggart) are shape-shifting creatures that assume the form of whatever most frightens the person who encounters them.
1.3.4.4.10.2.1. Con: All it takes to get rid of a Boggart is a [spell](https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/riddikulus) that Harry Potter's year mastered at the age of 13.
1.3.4.4.10.2.1.1. Con: This spell is not always easy to perform; Molly Weasley struggled immensely when confronted with the apparent bodies of her family.
1.3.4.4.10.3. Pro: Dementors can suck the soul out of a person.
1.3.4.4.10.3.1. Pro: The Dementor's Kiss is the act of a Dementor sucking out a person's soul and is considered by some to be a fate worse than death.
1.3.4.4.10.3.2. Con: The average person would likely never or only under extreme circumstances encounter a Dementor.
1.3.4.4.10.3.2.1. Con: The Dementors switched sides during the Second Wizarding War: they cannot be controlled and could decide to turn against wizards at any moment.
1.3.4.4.10.3.2.2. Con: There is no alternate prison than Azkaban so anyone who gets sent to prison will encounter Dementors.
1.3.4.4.10.3.2.3. Con: In some cases, people are sent to Azkaban before it has been proved that they committed a crime.
1.3.4.4.10.3.3. Pro: [Dementors](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dementor) have no loyalty, and will serve whoever provides them the most people to feed on.
1.3.4.4.10.3.4. Pro: Being near Dementors causes depression and despair, as [they feed on human happiness](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dementor). This makes them particularly cruel guards of Azkaban prison.
1.3.4.5. Pro: Phoenixes are fascinating and immensely helpful.
1.3.4.5.1. Con: Phoenixes are very rare and most wizards will never see or interact with one.
1.3.4.5.2. Pro: Phoenixes can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and when their bodies begin to fail, they burst into flame and are reborn from the ashes.
1.3.4.5.3. Pro: Phoenix tail feathers are used as cores for wands.
1.3.4.6. Pro: Unicorns are found throughout forests in northern Europe.
1.3.4.6.1. Pro: Unicorn hair is used as cores for wands.
1.3.4.6.2. Pro: [Unicorn blood](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Unicorn_blood) has the ability to save the drinker from death, no matter how close they are to it.
1.3.4.6.2.1. Pro: Voldemort used unicorn blood to sustain his life when he was occupying Quirrell's body, which itself was dying as a result of being shared by Voldemort's fragmented soul.
1.3.4.6.2.2. Con: The act of slaying a unicorn to drink its blood is said to [curse](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Unicorn_blood) the drinker and provide them only a half-life.
1.3.4.6.2.3. Con: Unicorn blood is strictly [controlled](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Unicorn_blood) by the Ministry of Magic, making it incredibly hard to get access to.
1.3.4.7. Pro: Sphinxes come from Egypt.
1.3.4.7.1. Pro: Sphinxes are highly intelligent and used by witches and wizards to stand guard. They can be dangerous when what they guard is threatened.
1.3.5. Con: Magic can also be used for evil purposes by those with bad intentions.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Dark wizards like Grindelwald, Voldemort, and the Death Eaters use magic to create pain, terror and death.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: The misuse of technology by some to harm others is not a phenomenon exclusive to the magical world. History shows people like Pol Pot and Hitler and the Nazis who caused great amounts of harm to the Muggle world by abusing their power.
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: Items can be cursed to harm those who touch them, such as the opal necklace which was used to curse Katie Bell.
1.3.5.1.3. Pro: Simple items can be transformed into dangerous ones which are intended to cause harm. For example, the black quill that Professor Umbridge made Harry Potter use during detentions used his blood as ink and carved anything he wrote with the quill into his hand.
1.3.5.1.3.1. Con: Simple and useful items being used to cause harm is not a practice exclusive to the wizarding world. There are many useful things that can be used for good and for evil in the Muggle world. For example, a knife can be used for cooking but also for stabbing and maiming.
1.3.5.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.5.4.1.1.
1.3.5.1.4. Pro: There is a great capacity to harm others using the Unforgivable Curses.
1.3.5.1.4.1. Pro: The ability to torture an individual and destroy their mental capacity is available through the Cruciatus Curse.
1.3.5.1.4.1.1. Con: Advanced torture techniques are available in the Muggle world as well and have been in use for centuries.
1.3.5.1.4.1.1.1. Con: While this is true, this torture is easier in the wizarding world.
1.3.5.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: All that is required for torture in the wizarding world is a wand, whereas advanced torture techniques in the Muggle world often require special implements and facilities.
1.3.5.1.4.2. Pro: With a simple Avada Kedavra spell, anyone can be murdered in an instant.
1.3.5.1.4.2.1. Pro: Wands are easy to conceal and use, so it is harder to predict and defend against a Killing Curse than it is to defend against Muggle weapons.
1.3.5.1.4.2.2. Con: There are plenty of possibilities in the Muggle world to murder people in an instant.
1.3.5.1.4.2.2.1. Con: Most Muggle ways of intentionally killing someone are not instantaneous.
1.3.5.1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: The methods of murder in the Muggle world that are not instantaneous are often incredibly painful and the victim goes through a tremendous amount of suffering. Asphyxiation, poisoning, forced drowning or bludgeoning are some examples of this. Suffering an instantaneous and painless death from the killing curse would be preferable to vast number of these methods.
1.3.5.1.4.2.3. Pro: There is [no](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Killing_Curse) defense to the Avada Kedavra spell other than avoiding it.
1.3.5.1.4.3. Con: The Unforgivable Curses are illegal in the wizarding world and their use is grounds for immediate life imprisonment in Azkaban Prison.
1.3.5.1.4.3.1. Con: Unforgivable Curses are not monitored.
1.3.5.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Harry Potter used the Cruciatus Curse on Amycus Carrow at Hogwarts and the Imperius Curse to control Travers when breaking into Gringotts. He was neither punished for using them nor even detected.
1.3.5.1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: These spells were cast just before the [Second Wizarding War](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War) when the Ministry of Magic was run by Death Eaters who used the Unforgivable Curses extensively.
1.3.5.1.4.3.1.2. Pro: The only way the Ministry of Magic can detect the use of Unforgivable Curses is by using 'Priori Incantatem' on a potential criminal's wand.
1.3.5.1.4.3.1.3. Pro: The Ministry was not aware that their own official, Barty Crouch Senior, was put under the Imperius Curse by Lord Voldemort.
1.3.5.1.4.4. Pro: The Imperius Curse can cause the victim to perform the unquestioned bidding of the caster.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Magic creates great potential for deception and manipulation.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: [Legilimency](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Legilimency) is the act of magically navigating through the many layers of a person's mind and correctly interpreting one's findings. It is the wizarding equivalent of what Muggles call 'mind reading'. The most advanced Legilimens can perform Legilimency nonverbally and wandlessly, without the victim's consent.
1.3.5.2.1.1. Con: Occlumency is the act of magically closing one's mind against Legilimency and can prevent a Legilimens from accessing one's thoughts and feelings, or influencing them.
1.3.5.2.1.1.1. Con: Occlumency is not normally taught at Hogwarts and it is difficult to master.
1.3.5.2.1.1.2. Con: The Muggle world recognizes some rights such as [the right to life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life) as unalienable because what they protect is sacrosanct. If minds could be invaded in the Muggle world like they can be through Legilimency, protection of one's mental well being would also be such a right. As such, people's minds should be protected regardless of whether they know Occlumency or not, just as the right to life is protected regardless of your ability to protect yourself against external threats.
1.3.5.2.1.1.2.1. Con: The right to life does not demand absolute autonomy for one's mind. One can live without a fully autonomous mind.
1.3.5.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: This is presuming the definition of the right to life would be the same in the wizarding world as it is in the Muggle world. Seeing that wizards have a way to differentiate between the soul and the physical realm of living, it is not unreasonable to say their definitions of the right to life would also be different to incorporate these differences.
1.3.5.2.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: This assumes that the wizarding world has a defined right to life. Since it is possible to contact the dead indirectly in the wizarding world, it is possible that people in that world do not have a strong need for this right as Muggles, who cannot be contacted after death.
1.3.5.2.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Just because the dead can be interacted with to some degree does not mean life ought not be protected to the highest extent in the wizarding world.
1.3.5.2.2. Pro: [Felix Felicis](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/g00/wiki/Felix_Felicis?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F), also called "Liquid Luck", is a magical potion that makes the drinker lucky for a period of time, during which everything they attempt will be successful, irrespective of their skill level or preparedness for that venture.
1.3.5.2.2.1. Con: It is a banned substance in all organised competitions as it is considered a form of cheating.
1.3.5.2.2.2. Con: It is incredibly difficult to make and cannot be accessed by most wizards.
1.3.5.2.3. Pro: A [Metamorphmagus](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Metamorphmagus) is a witch or wizard with the ability to change their physical appearance at will.
1.3.5.2.3.1. Con: Metamorphmagi are extremely rare as very few people are born with the skill and it is not possible to learn the skill.
1.3.5.2.3.2. Pro: This includes the ability to change one feature of their appearance or entirely take on the appearance of another person.
1.3.5.2.4. Pro: [Animagi](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Animagus) are able to masquerade as animals unbeknown to other wizards.
1.3.5.2.4.1. Pro: The Ministry registers Animagi but there were at least four Animagi \(James Potter, Peter Pettigrew, Sirius Black and Rita Skeeter\) that were never registered or caught by the Ministry. Since the official list of Animagi is so small, there might be many more illegal Animagi living within the wizarding world.
1.3.5.2.5. Pro: The wizarding world has Polyjuice Potion, the Imperius Curse, and numerous other charms, curses, and potions that can make it unclear if someone is indeed themself and/or acting on their own accord.
1.3.5.2.5.1. Con: [Thief's Downfall](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Thief%27s_Downfall) is a charm that lifts enchantments, including the Imperius Curse and the effects of Polyjuice potions.
1.3.5.2.5.2. Con: Even if these options are present, they are not frequently used. So they do not constitute a significant danger.
1.3.5.2.6. Con: -> See 1.3.5.2.5.1.
1.3.5.2.7. Pro: Invisibility cloaks and disillusionment charms can help people to hide, escape, eavesdrop and stalk.
1.3.5.2.7.1. Con: Invisibility cloaks and disillusionment charms also have legitimate and beneficial uses.
1.3.5.2.8. Pro: Love potions can be used to create affectionate or even obsessive feelings that override rational thought. This makes them the ultimate substance for date rape.
1.3.5.2.9. Pro: Memories of individuals can be deleted or false memories can be implanted via charms without the target realizing it.
1.3.5.2.9.1. Pro: Gilderoy Lockhart was notorious for changing the memories of anyone who could dispute his supposed acts of bravery.
1.3.5.2.9.2. Pro: The Ministry of Magic uses [Obliviators](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Obliviator) to remove memories of Muggles that witness something related to the wizarding world.
1.3.6. Con: The Muggle world is also full of endless quantities of knowledge, hobbies, interests, and skills.
1.3.6.1. Con: Wizards also have the possibility of exploring Muggle knowledge, hobbies, interests and skills if they so choose.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.7.1.
1.3.6.1.2. Con: Prejudice against the Muggle world would stop many wizards from taking an interest in such Muggle things.
1.3.7. Con: Close relationships are [what keep people happy](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/) throughout their lives. Pursuing interesting possibilities might be fun for a while but it is unlikely to actually improve your life in the long term.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Research on the "[hedonic treadmill](http://faculty.som.yale.edu/ShaneFrederick/HedonicTreadmill.pdf)" indicates that even large changes in wealth or possessions do not affect long-term happiness. The same is probably true for access to interesting magical tricks.
1.3.7.2. Pro: People born into the wizarding world are constantly exposed to magic. This means that they don't find magic particularly exciting or enriching.
1.3.7.2.1. Con: Muggles are surrounded by existing technology but are still excited to experience new technology. Given the extent to which magic exists, there will likely always be an element of it that an individual wizard has not experienced before.
1.3.7.2.1.1. Con: Given that magic seems to evolve at a slow rate, it seems likely that this interest would rapidly disappear.
1.3.7.3. Con: While wizards have the ability to pursue these interesting possibilities, they are also able to seek close relationships as those in the Muggle world have. Many develop long term friendships and relationships.
1.3.7.3.1. Con: In general, close relationships with Muggles are rare and the magical community mostly associates with its own members whether because of stigma or the complications of keeping magic a secret. Historically, in countries such as the US, the Muggle and magical communities were even strictly segregated.
1.3.7.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.2.
1.3.7.3.3. Pro: It is not necessary for wizards to develop relationships with Muggles to have the fulfilment, as there are enough people in the wizarding community for them to still develop meaningful relationships.
1.3.7.4. Con: People in the wizarding world have the choice to pursue relationships in the Muggle world but Muggles don't have the analogous privilege because they aren't aware of the magical world's existence. This makes living in the wizarding world preferable as it increases the number of available options.
1.3.7.4.1. Con: The presence of 'half-blood' as an epithet suggests that marrying Muggles is highly frowned upon and seems extremely rare within the wizarding world.
1.3.7.4.1.1. Con: There were only [28](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pure-blood\)) pure-blood families in 1930s Britain \(and likely far fewer today\) suggesting that marrying a Muggle is actually fairly common.
1.3.7.4.1.1.1. Pro: As per terminology, any wizard who is not either pure-blood or Muggle-born is considered a half-blood, even if they have two wizard parents. Since they need not have exactly half-Muggle/half-wizard heritage, being a half-blood is probably the most common phenomenon in the Wizarding World in terms of heritage.
1.3.7.4.1.2. Con: Many well-known and popular wizards and witches, like Gilderoy Lockhart, Tom Marvolo Riddle \(Lord Voldemort\), Severus Snape, Dolores Umbridge, Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter, had a Muggle-born parent.
1.3.7.4.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.7.4.1.1.1.
1.3.7.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.3.1.
1.3.7.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.2.
1.3.8. Pro: The memory charm, Obliviate, can be used to selectively alter a person's memory. This means that people do not have to live with negative memories if they would prefer not to.
1.3.8.1. Con: All memories, positive and negative, make up part of a person's lived experience and should not be erased.
1.3.8.2. Pro: Oftentimes negative memories serve no purpose and only cause suffering.
1.3.8.3. Con: If the casting of the spell goes wrong it can cause serious and irreversible memory loss to those subjected to it.
1.3.8.3.1. Pro: Gilderoy Lockhart's attempt at using the memory charm with a broken wand backfired on himself and he ended up in St Mungo's Hospital with severe memory loss.
1.3.8.4. Con: The spell can be used maliciously.
1.3.8.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.2.9.1.
1.3.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.
1.3.10. Pro: There are many interesting magical traits and skills that wizards and witches can acquire, inherit or learn.
1.3.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.2.3.
1.3.10.2. Pro: A [Seer](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Seer) is a gifted wizard or witch who has the ability to see into the future with their Inner Eye. Seers look into future events through visions and dreams or physical objects like tea dregs, tarot cards, and crystal balls.
1.3.10.3. Pro: A [Parselmouth](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Parselmouth) can speak to snakes and other magical serpent-based creatures. This ability is extremely rare and is typically hereditary.
1.3.10.3.1. Con: The ability to speak to snakes is not a particularly exciting or useful skill.
1.3.10.3.1.1. Pro: Given the history of wizards who have been Parselmouths, this skill is actually a bad thing given the way people view those with it.
1.3.10.3.1.2. Con: The ability to speak to a non-human species breaks all barriers of science and technology seen in the Muggle world.
1.3.10.3.1.3. Con: The ability to obtain information about the life of a non-human creature could certainly be described as exciting.
1.3.10.4. Pro: Through a great deal of study, it is possible to become an Animagus and to be able to transform into a particular animal.
1.3.10.4.1. Con: The process is extremely arduous and can [result](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Animagus) in permanent half-human, half-animal mutations if done incorrectly.
1.3.10.4.2. Con: You cannot choose which animal you can transform into, it is linked to your personality.
1.3.10.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.2.1.
1.3.11. Pro: There are a number of interesting magical objects and inventions that people in the wizarding world can use.
1.3.11.1. Pro: [Wizard's Chess](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/g00/wiki/Wizard%27s_Chess?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) is played with the rules, pieces and board identical to Muggle chess. However, the pieces are magically animated, and they violently attack each other when performing a capture.
1.3.11.2. Pro: [Mokeskin pouches](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/g00/wiki/Mokeskin_pouch?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) are a type of draw-string pouch that can be operated only by the owner.
1.3.11.3. Pro: [Omnioculars](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/g00/wiki/Omnioculars?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) are the wizarding equivalent of Muggle binoculars, but with the additional features of being able to magically slow down and replay action.
1.3.11.4. Pro: [Enchanted coins](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Enchanted_coin) are fake Galleons which can be used for secret communication.
1.3.11.4.1. Pro: They were created by Hermione Granger in 1995 to communicate with other members of Dumbledore's Army and to organise secret meetings between them.
1.3.11.5. Pro: A [Pensieve](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/g00/wiki/Pensieve?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) is a dish that is enchanted to recreate memories so that the owner or others can relive them.
1.3.11.5.1. Con: If someone accesses someone else's pensieve, the owner's memories can be viewed without their permission which is a gross invasion of privacy.
1.3.11.5.1.1. Con: This is not that different from accidentally leaving confidential information or possessions in a place where others can view them in the Muggle world.
1.3.11.5.2. Pro: Pensieves allow advanced wizards to examine and sort through thoughts and ideas.
1.3.11.5.3. Pro: One is able to pass on memories to be viewed in a Pensieve, as Snape does when he is dying and he passes on memories to Harry Potter to explain his history with Lily Potter.
1.3.11.5.4. Con: Pensieves are very [rare and powerful](https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/pensieve/) magical objects, and as such, it is unlikely that most members of the magical community would ever have the opportunity to use one.
1.3.11.6. Pro: A [Remembrall](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Remembrall) is a glass ball that fills with red smoke when the owner has forgotten something.
1.3.11.6.1. Con: Remembralls are not actually particularly useful items, as they do not specify what it is that you have forgotten.
1.3.11.7. Pro: [Time-Turners](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Time-Turner), which resemble hourglasses on necklaces, allow people the opportunity to travel through time.
1.3.11.7.1. Con: The use of the very limited amount of Time-Turners owned by the Ministry of Magic is [restricted](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/time-turner) by hundreds of laws.
1.3.11.7.2. Con: A Time-Turner cannot enable 'long-distance' time travel: investigations into time-magic show that "the longest period that may be relived without the possibility of serious harm to the traveller or to time itself is around [five hours](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/time-turner)".
1.3.11.7.3. Con: All of the Ministry of Magic's Time-Turners were [destroyed](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/time-turner) during a battle in the Department of Mysteries.
1.3.11.7.3.1. Con: If the technology to create and store Time-Turners exists, then it seems likely that the Ministry's supply could easily be restored.
1.3.11.7.4. Pro: Hermione Granger was given a Time-Turner to use at Hogwarts to allow her to take more classes.
1.3.11.7.5. Pro: The use of a Time-Turner allowed Hermione Granger and Harry Potter to save Buckbeak the Hippogriff and help Sirius Black escape.
1.3.11.8. Con: The divide between the magical world and the Muggle world means that the wizarding world lacks most modern technology and is, at times, archaic.
1.3.11.8.1. Pro: The wizarding world still uses gas lamps and candles.
1.3.11.8.1.1. Con: It is advantageous for the wizarding community to use gas lamps instead of electricity because of the command wizards can exercise on fire by using magic, for example, through the [Fire Making Charm](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Fire-Making_Spell).
1.3.11.8.2. Pro: The wizarding world still uses quills, ink, and parchment scrolls.
1.3.11.8.2.1. Con: Paper, pens and ball point refills are in no way a meaningful upgrade from the use of parchment, quills and ink respectively.
1.3.11.8.2.2. Con: Using magic means that the use of these objects can be very easy and ensures they do not require upgrading. For example, quills can be charmed to self-ink and write on their own.
1.3.11.8.3. Pro: Wizards use owl post, which is a slow and inefficient form of communication.
1.3.11.8.3.1. Con: The wizarding world has several other ways of communicating with each other that are much faster.
1.3.11.8.3.1.1. Pro: A [Patronus](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Patronus_Charm) can be used as a means of secure communication by delivering messages in the voice of the caster.
1.3.11.8.3.1.1.1. Con: The [only](http://web.archive.org/web/20110806214330/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=99) people who currently know of this ability are members of the Order of the Phoenix.
1.3.11.8.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.3.11.8.3.1.3. Pro: Portraits in the wizarding world can be used to communicate with other witches and wizards.
1.3.11.8.3.1.4. Pro: A [fire-call](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Magic/Fire-call) is a specialised use of the Floo network, whereby a witch or wizard simply inserts their head into a connected and Floo-prepared fireplace, and their head is transported to the fireplace of the person with whom they wish to speak.
1.3.11.8.3.1.4.1. Con: The principal limitation of full-body transportation by Floo network also applies to this form of communication: fire-calls require physical access to a fireplace connected to the rest of the network, so it is not always feasible.
1.3.11.8.3.2. Con: Owls can find a particular person no matter where in the world they are.
1.3.11.8.4. Pro: The wizarding world is unfamiliar with electronics, like television, telephones, and computers.
1.3.11.8.5. Pro: The increasing technological divide reduces the ability of wizards to interact and coexist with the Muggle world, since they do not know how to use ubiquitous technologies.
1.3.11.8.6. Con: Muggles need new technology to overcome the limits of old technology. Wizards can just use magic to overcome any limitations.
1.3.11.8.7. Con: Avoidance of Muggle devices is [cultural](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/technology). The magical community prides itself on not needing the many devices that Muggles have created to do what can be done by magic.
1.3.11.8.7.1. Con: The wizarding world's non-use of Muggle devices is in fact largely down to practical difficulties.
1.3.11.8.7.1.1. Pro: Magic interferes with electric energy and thus makes it, for the most part, impossible for wizards to use modern technology. This is a highly impractical side-effect.
1.3.11.8.7.1.1.1. Pro: Electronic devices do [not](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hogwarts:_A_History) work within the grounds of Hogwarts.
1.3.11.8.7.1.1.2. Pro: Magical methods seem to advance slowly, if at all, whereas technology has grown exponentially over the last several centuries. The comparative advantages of magic look likely to erode into the future.
1.3.11.8.7.1.1.2.1. Con: Magic is scientifically impossible in the Muggle world. That is a comparative advantage that time will never erode.
1.3.11.8.7.1.1.3. Con: Many technologies that Muggles use are not necessary for wizards as they can utilize magic.
1.3.11.8.7.1.1.3.1. Pro: Some advancements in Muggle medicine are primitive compared to the [magical techniques](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Healing_magic) employed by Healers.
1.3.11.8.7.1.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.
1.3.11.8.7.1.1.3.3. Con: Wizards would still benefit from the use of technology such as computers, and systems such as Google to get easy and quick access to information.
1.3.11.8.7.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Students at Hogwarts only learn using textbooks. It would be much more efficient for them to have access to reading and research materials online.
1.3.11.8.7.1.1.3.3.2. Pro: Arthur Weasley's greatest ambition was to figure out how Muggle planes fly. This could be easily accomplished with Google.
1.3.11.8.8. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.9.
1.3.11.8.9. Con: Wizards adopted some technology from Muggles, such as [plumbing](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/chamber-of-secrets) and cameras.
1.3.11.8.10. Pro: The wizard world still relies on fires and fireplaces for heating.
1.3.11.8.11. Con: -> See 1.3.11.8.7.1.1.3.
1.3.11.9. Pro: A [Sneakoscope](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Sneakoscope), which looks like a glass spinning top, lights up, spins and whistles if something or someone untrustworthy is nearby.
1.3.11.10. Pro: [Revealers and Probity Probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter) can be used to make invisible ink appear and detect spells of concealment and hidden magical objects respectively.
1.3.11.10.1. Con: Without the ability to magically hide things in the first place these items would be irrelevant.
1.3.11.11. Pro: The Weasley family has a [special clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter) in their home with nine hands, one for every member of the family. Instead of telling the time, the clock reveals the location or status of each family member - whether it be 'Home', 'School', 'At Work' or 'In Mortal Peril'.
1.4. Pro: Magic has many practical uses that can increase the efficiency of day-to-day life.
1.4.1. Con: The wizarding world is limited in some very important respects.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Employment opportunities are extremely limited.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: There appear to be very few wizards involuntarily out of work.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: The majority of people in wizarding Britain work at Hogwarts, in the Ministry of Magic or in a wizarding shop. Opportunities are far more diverse in the Muggle world.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: A significant number of Muggles in Britain work in the [public sector](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/publicsectorpersonnel/bulletins/publicsectoremployment/march2016), and [retail](https://www.retailappointment.co.uk/career-advice/talking-shop/uk-retail-facts-and-figures) is the largest source of private sector employment, suggesting opportunities are not all that diverse.
1.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.2.3.
1.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.
1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.11.8.
1.4.3. Pro: There are many useful and simple spells that wizards learn and are able to use frequently.
1.4.3.1. Pro: The [Levitation Charm](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Levitation_Charm) can be used to move objects by making them fly.
1.4.3.2. Pro: [Lumos](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wand-Lighting_Charm) is a spell which sends light from the tip of a wand, to be used as a torch.
1.4.3.3. Pro: The charm Reparo can be used to easily fix things.
1.4.3.4. Pro: [Capacious Extremis](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/extension-charms), the undetectable extension charm, increases the inner dimensions of an object, while leaving the outer dimensions unchanged, and also makes the content lighter. It makes packing and storage much easier.
1.4.3.4.1. Con: Because of [the potential for infractions](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/extension-charms) under the International Statue of Secrecy, the Ministry of Magic has laid down strict guidelines stating that capacity enhancement is not for private use, but only for the production of objects \(such as school trunks\).
1.4.3.5. Pro: The [Summoning Charm](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/g00/wiki/Summoning_Charm?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) can be used to summon objects to oneself across physical space without actually having to go find and retrieve them.
1.4.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.3.1.1.
1.4.4. Pro: The culmination of these efficiencies is that wizards and witches can spend more of their time doing meaningful things, such as investing in relationships.
1.4.5. Pro: Wizards and witches use their magic to do things like clean their house and cook meals.
1.4.5.1. Pro: The [Scouring Charm](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Scouring_Charm) is used to clean household items.
1.4.5.2. Pro: [Tergeo](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Tergeo) is a cleaning spell, used to clean things such as grease off surfaces.
1.4.6. Con: -> See 1.3.11.8.7.1.1.
1.4.7. Con: For all the practical uses of magic, it does not seem to increase the quality of life of wizards relative to the Muggle population. For example, the Weasleys, as a relatively poor wizarding family, still struggle to get by in some respects.
1.4.7.1. Con: While there is still wealth inequality in the wizarding world, it seems as if the average standard of living is still superior.
1.4.8. Con: Many of magic's practical uses just imitate what Muggles already have available through technology, and in many cases are inferior.
1.4.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.4.8.2. Pro: Wizarding media is largely confined to books, slightly-animated pictures, and oddities such as a Pensieve. In contrast Muggle media includes on-demand access to movies, music, and video games.
1.4.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.
1.5. Con: The capacity for harm is greater when magic is involved.
1.5.1. Pro: A significant number of wizards throughout wizarding history have practised the [Dark Arts](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Arts).
1.5.1.1. Pro: [Ekrizdis](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Ekrizdis) magically lured, tortured and killed Muggles.
1.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.
1.5.1.3. Pro: [Herpo the Foul](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Herpo_the_Foul) invented many vile curses, was the first wizard to hatch a Basilisk and invented Horcruxes.
1.5.1.4. Pro: Salazar Slytherin built a secret chamber underneath Hogwarts to house a Basilisk with the intention of the beast one day being unleashed on Muggle-Born students.
1.5.2. Con: There is no entrenched culture of militarism in the magical world.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The Ministry of Magic does not have a standing army.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: The Auror Department is essentially a standing army, given that the only weaponisation wizards need to wage war is their wands and Aurors are highly trained in magical combat.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: Given the small size of the Auror department, it seems disingenuous to characterise them as a standing army; instead they act more as a police force.
1.5.2.2. Pro: There is no evidence of international wars or military tensions in the wizarding world like those that exist in the Muggle world.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: The [First Wizarding War](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/First_Wizarding_War), [Second Wizarding War](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War), and [Global Wizarding War](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Global_wizarding_war) were all fought within the space of 50 years and resulted in large numbers of wizarding casualties.
1.5.2.2.2. Con: There are other possible explanations for the lack of international warfare in the wizarding community. It does not necessarily mean they are less militaristic.
1.5.2.2.2.1. Pro: Because wizarding communities are isolated from each other, there is not much opportunity for international interaction and warfare.
1.5.2.2.2.2. Pro: Wars are usually fought out of resource scarcity or for territorial advancement, both of which are unlikely in the wizarding world.
1.5.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: Wizards have no incentive to engage in international wars for resources, since magic prevents resource scarcity.
1.5.2.2.2.2.2. Pro: Wizarding communities do not have clearly defined territory because they are so intertwined with the Muggle world.
1.5.2.2.2.3. Pro: A full scale war between wizarding nations would also break the International Statute of Secrecy, which is treated as sacrosanct by the global magical community.
1.5.2.2.3. Pro: The institutions of the wizarding world do not appear to stockpile weapons to use against one another.
1.5.2.2.3.1. Con: The wizarding world does not need deadly weapons to cause significant harm. Various curses can cause the same or even higher level of harm as any Muggle weapon.
1.5.2.3. Con: -> See 1.5.2.2.1.
1.5.2.4. Con: Both Voldemort and Gellert Grindelwald had armies of followers to aid them in their respective missions.
1.5.2.4.1. Pro: Voldemort's army consisted of not only Dark Wizards called Death Eaters but also various other creatures like giants, Dementors, Acromantulas and werewolves.
1.5.2.5. Con: The Order of the Phoenix was an army that actively fought against the Death Eaters.
1.5.2.6. Pro: The wizarding world lacks many of the deadly weapons present in the Muggle world.
1.5.2.6.1. Pro: Although there are no statistics about the murder rate in the wizarding world, it seems to have a lower murder rate than most of the Muggle world.
1.5.2.6.2. Pro: Weapons of mass destruction such as nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are far worse than any military technology available in the wizarding world.
1.5.2.6.2.1. Con: Wepons of mass destruction is also possible to use for non-muggles. If Voldemort wanted to use nuclear weapons, he could easily steal them.
1.5.2.6.3. Con: -> See 1.5.2.2.3.1.
1.5.2.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.2.3.
1.5.2.6.5. Con: The wizarding world is not a separate world. There is nothing stopping people in the wizarding world from using Muggle weapons.
1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.5.2.6.
1.5.4. Pro: One creative dark wizard, or even a curious but ill-advised non-dark wizard, could end the world with very little effort.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Transfiguring matter into dark matter could create an explosion large enough to render the earth uninhabitable. There would be no defense against this kind of threat.
1.5.5. Pro: The scale of harm permitted by magic is seemingly infinite, while the possible positive effects have an upper bound - the dead cannot be revived, and souls cannot be returned.
1.5.6. Pro: Everyone carries wands, which are the wizard equivalent of guns \(wizards describe guns as metal wands Muggles kill each other with\) which makes the potential for escalation and harm greater.
1.5.6.1. Con: The most commonly used offensive spells \(like Stupefy or Petrificus Totalus\) are harmless. People rarely use spells that are bodily harmful or deadly.
1.5.6.1.1. Con: While not deadly, being rendered unconscious or immobile can still cause a wizard significant harm as they are left completely defenseless.
1.5.6.2. Pro: Students are taught about the Unforgivable Curses, which are used to torture, control and kill people. These are spells that they learn about and then could use.
1.5.6.2.1. Con: Students at Hogwarts were only taught the Unforgivable Curses in one year, because their teacher happened to be a Death Eater in disguise. This would not be a general occurrence.
1.5.6.2.1.1. Pro: Barty Crouch Jr, disguised as Mad-Eye Moody, told his class that the Unforgivable Curses were not on the official syllabus as the Ministry of Magic did not want them taught.
1.5.6.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.4.3.
1.5.6.2.1.3. Con: Knowing Mad-Eye Moody, it would not have been out of character for him to teach the students the Unforgiveable Curses. One of the reasons Barty Crouch Jr was able to go undetected for so long is because of his very convincing impression of Mad-Eye.
1.5.6.3. Con: The ease of escalation is counterbalanced by the fact that bystanders can easily intervene to stop a fight, for example by Stunning or disarming participants.
1.5.6.3.1. Con: This logic is equally applied in support of gun rights in the USA, yet the presence of guns does not improve safety.
1.5.6.3.1.1. Con: Guns are lethal weapons that are difficult to use. All wizards are familiar with magic, which can be easily used nonlethally to prevent a fight.
1.5.6.4. Con: Wizards can use a [shield charm](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Shield_Charm) to protect themselves against the majority of curses.
1.5.6.4.1. Con: If your attacker catches you off guard you may not have time to cast a shield charm to protect yourself.
1.5.6.4.1.1. Con: The element of surprise gives an unfair advantage to individuals in Muggle combat as well. It is not something exclusive to wizarding duels.
1.5.7. Con: Magic also has the capacity to do good as it can be a significant time and effort saver, allowing wizards to contribute positively to society in easy ways with little difficulty.
1.5.7.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.
1.5.7.2. Pro: For many Muggles, limited time stops them from being able to contribute to charities etc. Things that occupy a lot of time, such as housework, can be completed much more quickly with magic.
1.5.7.2.1. Con: This assumes that they would use this additional time for charitable causes. It is just as plausible they would fill it with other things they wanted to do.
1.5.7.3. Pro: The average wizard significantly outlives the average Muggle. This also gives them more time to devote to worthwhile causes.
1.5.7.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.7.2.1.
1.5.7.3.2. Pro: Wizards have a much [longer](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wizardkind) life-expectancy than Muggles, reaching 137 years in the mid-1990s.
1.5.7.3.2.1. Pro: One wizard reached the age of [755](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wizardkind#cite_note-3) in the 1990s.
1.5.7.3.2.2. Pro: Elderly wizards appear to enjoy a better quality of life than most elderly Muggles.
1.5.7.3.2.2.1. Pro: Many wizards, such as Albus Dumbledore, continue working well into old age. Elderly Muggles are often required to retire at a certain age.
1.5.7.3.2.2.2. Pro: Most elderly wizards are capable of living alone without assistance. This is relatively less common in the Muggle world.
1.5.7.4. Con: Automation and technological developments mean that Muggles can achieve the sorts of everyday efficiency gains that magic brings.
1.5.8. Con: Defense is also made easier through magic.
1.5.8.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.4.2.3.
1.5.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.4.
1.5.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.2.
1.5.10. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.4.
1.6. Con: The wizarding community is less diverse.
1.6.1. Con: Even if the community as a whole is less diverse, the capacity for easy travel makes it easy to access the full diversity that exists both within the wizarding world and Muggle world.
1.6.1.1. Con: Although there are many wizarding communities around the world, they often have very little contact with each other.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: There is no apparent aid given to the British in fighting Voldemort despite the global ramifications that his victory would have brought.
1.6.1.1.2. Con: The [International Confederation of Wizards](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/International_Confederation_of_Wizards) is an intergovernmental organisation with similar functions to the United Nations in the Muggle World.
1.6.1.1.3. Con: Magical technology allows magical communities around the world to be in contact with each other \([wizards knew of the New World](https://www.pottermore.com/collection-episodic/history-of-magic-in-north-america-en) before the Europeans did\).
1.6.1.2. Con: Given the requirement to hide magic from Muggles, it is difficult for wizards to access the Muggle world and interact with it on any meaningful level that exposes them to its diversity.
1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.1.
1.6.3. Con: The wizarding world has many sources of diversity that the Muggle world lacks - for example, the existence of non-human intelligent creatures like elves, goblins, centaurs, and giants.
1.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.3.2.
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.6.6. Con: The diversity of the wizarding community is unlikely to impact the wellbeing of the average wizard very much.
1.6.6.1. Con: If the lack of diversity in the wizarding world is indicative of prejudices that exist, then living in the wizarding world involves a risk of being subject to those prejudices.
1.6.7. Con: Diversity is not necessarily positive, and homogeneity might be beneficial, especially for a community as small and dependent on mutual cooperation as that of wizards.
1.6.7.1. Pro: Diversity [has been linked](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9477.2007.00176.x/abstract) to reduced social solidarity, trust, altruism and social capital in societies. Some societies are able to overcome these problems, but by no means all.
1.6.7.1.1. Con: These research results [have been called into question](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/50e64c35e4b02b36141d5175/t/564de301e4b082df3a504e1a/1447944961025/2.AbascalBaldassarri_HeterogeneityTrust_AJS2015.pdf). What causes the above-mentioned problems is not diversity but inequality and prejudice.
1.6.8. Pro: The wizarding community is smaller than the Muggle community.
1.6.8.1. Pro: The wizarding world is naturally secretive.
1.6.8.1.1. Pro: Keeping secrecy from the Muggle world is legally enforced.
1.6.8.1.1.1. Pro: The International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy states that each individual Ministry or Council is responsible for hiding the presence of the magical community in their own country.
1.6.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: Each Ministry is held responsible for the control of magical beasts, curbing public displays of underage magic, and ensuring that magical games and sports are played without risk of discovery.
1.6.8.1.1.2. Pro: Underage magic has been banned from use outside of school under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery.
1.6.8.1.1.2.1. Pro: Compliance with the Decree is monitored and enforced by the Improper Use of Magic Office at the Ministry of Magic using the Trace Charm.
1.6.8.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The Trace Charm has failed to do its work in some instances.
1.6.8.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Harry Potter was almost expelled from school due to Dobby's magic which registered as his magic when in the Muggle world.
1.6.8.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: It is possible that numerous other wizards and witches were expelled due to this oversight as they did not have the fame that Harry attracted.
1.6.8.1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: When Tom Riddle was sixteen, he murdered his father and grandparents with the Killing Curse and then modified his uncle Morfin Gaunt's memory so that he would confess to the crime. The Trace Charm failed to show three uses of the Killing Curse by a sixteen-year old in a Muggle home.
1.6.8.1.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: The fact that the Ministry generally ignores when the Trace is broken by underage wizards and witches of wizarding families, expecting their parents to discipline them, essentially makes it useless at monitoring their use of magic.
1.6.8.1.1.2.2. Pro: Students found to be in violation of this decree stand the risk of immediate removal from Hogwarts.
1.6.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.6.10. Con: The wizarding community is drawn from essentially a random subset of the world's population and is thus as racially diverse as the Muggle world is. Yet despite this it seems to have far less racism.
1.6.10.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.6.10.2. Con: It does not seem to be the case that the wizarding world is an accurate subset of the population, as it seems to be overwhelmingly white.
1.6.10.2.1. Con: The UK is [87% white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_the_United_Kingdom), which explains the heavily white makeup of the British wizarding population.
1.6.10.2.1.1. Pro: Two out of the eight known Gryffindor students \(25%\) in Harry Potter's year \(Dean Thomas and Parvati Patil\) are people of colour.
1.7. Con: The wizarding world is authoritarian, oppressive, and intrusive.
1.7.1. Pro: The Ministry of Magic enables discrimination rather than protecting minorities.
1.7.1.1. Pro: The Ministry bans non-human magical creatures from carrying wands.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Non-human creatures have their own brands of magic and do not need wands to perform magic.
1.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: House elves are able to use their magic and Apparate even in places equipped with anti-Apparition charms.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The house-elves at Hogwarts can Apparate within its walls, Kreacher was able to escape from the lake where Voldemort hid his Horcrux and Dobby was able to Apparate within and out of Malfoy Manor when it was used to house prisoners.
1.7.1.1.2. Con: Some human-like creatures like trolls and giants are not intellectually developed enough to use wands responsibly.
1.7.1.1.3. Con: Some magical creatures also refuse to share their magical secrets with witches and wizards: for example, [goblin-made silver](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Goblin-wrought_silver).
1.7.1.2. Pro: The Ministry permits house-elves to be enslaved for generations at a time.
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: The contract between house-elves and masters strip the elves of all agency. Elves are obligated to do their master's bidding, and are forced to punish themselves if they disobey commands.
1.7.1.2.1.1. Pro: Kreacher was forced to do Sirius Black's bidding even though he despised Sirius.
1.7.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Kreacher managed to bypass Sirius' orders by interpreting his orders, which lead to Sirius's death.
1.7.1.2.1.2. Pro: Dobby was forced to serve the Malfoy family despite being treated brutally.
1.7.1.2.2. Pro: House-elves have no rights of their own and are subjected to terrible living conditions. For example, [Kreacher](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Kreacher) had to sleep in a cupboard under a boiler while serving the Black family.
1.7.1.2.3. Con: House-elves seem to respect the culture of enslavement.
1.7.1.2.3.1. Pro: Even though their brand of magic is powerful and wandless, they never harm their masters, despite being subjected to terrible living and working conditions.
1.7.1.2.3.1.1. Con: The magical contract between house-elves and their masters prevents them from harming their masters.
1.7.1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Kreacher hated his master Sirius Black and always looked for loopholes in Sirius' commands to spite him. But Kreacher couldn't explicitly harm Sirius despite his feelings because the magical contract prevented him from harming his master.
1.7.1.2.3.1.2. Con: House-elves find ways to bypass their enslavement in order to harm their masters. For instance, Kreacher manages to lead his master Sirius Black to death; Dobby's attempt at saving Harry's life causes at the same time harm to his master Lucius. House-elves have free will and are not that protective towards their masters.
1.7.1.2.3.2. Pro: House-elves feel insulted if their master attempts to pay them, give them pensions, or reward their service with anything except gratitude.
1.7.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: When Hermione Granger [began hiding clothes](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/g00/wiki/House-elf?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) in Gryffindor Tower in an attempt to free the house-elves of Hogwarts, the house-elves felt insulted, and everyone except Dobby refused to clean the Gryffindor common room in protest.
1.7.1.2.3.2.2. Con: House-elves suffer from the lack of education organised by the Ministry of Magic in order to brainwash them and make them accept their position in the magical society.
1.7.1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: The Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare \([S.P.E.W](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Society_for_the_Promotion_of_Elfish_Welfare).\) was an organisation founded in 1994 by Hermione Granger in response to what she saw as gross injustice in the treatment of house-elves at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup. Also, Hermione went on to work for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, where she continued to work for the rights of magical creatures. She may have re-founded SPEW as a semi-department and part of her Department.
1.7.1.2.3.3. Pro: House-elves prefer to work in hiding, and consider it mark of professionalism that they do all the work but their existence is never noticed.
1.7.1.2.3.4. Con: The enslavement of house-elves is still morally wrong. They are rational, autonomous beings and the wizarding community owes to them every moral protection that they would owe to other human beings since they have free will and the ability to reason.
1.7.1.2.3.4.1. Pro: Dobby delivers a warning to Harry against the wishes of his master, knowing that doing so will be problematic for him.
1.7.1.2.3.4.2. Pro: Dobby understood the rules around enslavement, but made it very clear to Harry Potter that he was mistreated and unhappy with the Malfoys.
1.7.1.2.3.4.3. Pro: Kreacher shows free will in his attempts to resist Sirius’s efforts to get rid of his mother’s artifacts.
1.7.1.2.3.5. Con: The house-elves’ resistance to their freedom is an indication of the depth of their bondage rather than their own desire.
1.7.1.2.3.5.1. Pro: W. E. B. DuBois in his work [The Souls of Black Folk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Souls_of_Black_Folk#.22Of_Our_Spiritual_Strivings.22) observed this phenomenon that happens in the case of groups that suffer extended periods of prejudice. Over time, the self-image of these groups aligns with the image of them held by those that keep them in bondage which plays a part in maintaining their state.
1.7.1.2.3.5.2. Pro: The way house-elves feel about their lives can be likened to the most extreme case of [Stockholm Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome). They have been denied rights and agency for so long that they now feel it their duty to remain enslaved.
1.7.1.2.4. Pro: The Ministry allows institutional enslavement of elves. Hogwarts school has a team of house-elves who are responsible for cooking, cleaning and maintaining the castle without ever being heard or seen.
1.7.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.3.2.2.
1.7.1.4. Pro: The Ministry of Magic has increasingly restricted the land on which [Centaurs](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Centaur) can live.
1.7.1.5. Con: The Ministry of Magic is not representative of the whole of the Wizarding community.
1.7.2. Con: Despite the inadequacies of the wizarding world's governing institutions, individuals capable of magic do not appear to need wizarding government services in order to survive and provide for their families.
1.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.
1.7.3. Pro: There is a decided lack of privacy in the wizarding world.
1.7.3.1. Con: The high value placed on privacy by Muggles is a social construct that developed as a result of social evolution. The magical community is mostly aware of these intrusive government policies and that they are not displeased by these actions; this attitude points to a general social outlook that does not value privacy to the extent that the Muggle community does. As such, the acts of the government cannot be seen as oppressive.
1.7.3.2. Pro: The government keeps records of all citizens. In Professor McGonagall's office, a magic quill writes down the name of every wizard and witch when they are born. Because the school answers to the Ministry of Magic, the government has a record of every member of the population.
1.7.3.2.1. Con: Most governments keep records of all citizens, including birth certificates and death certificates.
1.7.3.3. Pro: The Marauder's Map shows every inch of the Hogwarts grounds and where everyone is every minute of every day.
1.7.3.3.1. Con: The Marauder's Map was created illegally and would be immediately confiscated by someone in a position of authority.
1.7.3.3.1.1. Con: If the Marauder's Map could be created in secret and kept hidden by teenagers, there is no doubt that something similar could be created by others.
1.7.3.4. Pro: People can Apparate unexpectedly into private rooms and spaces.
1.7.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.3.
1.7.3.5. Con: Privacy in the Muggle world is decreasing rapidly due to the advent of the Internet. Since the wizarding world lacks technology, it may soon be more private than the Muggle world.
1.7.3.5.1. Pro: On the Internet, everyone's consumption patterns are minutely tracked.
1.7.3.5.2. Pro: Internet surveillance by the government is common in many countries.
1.7.3.6. Pro: The Trace Charm allows the Ministry to track the activity and location of all underage wizards with great accuracy.
1.7.3.6.1. Con: The Trace is only put on underage wizards to uphold the International Statute of Secrecy, to prevent exposure to Muggles.
1.7.3.6.1.1. Pro: It is impossible to subject adults beyond the age of 17 to the Trace Charm.
1.7.4. Pro: Wizarding culture is cruel and nefarious as it does not respect the mind and soul of the individual as sacrosanct.
1.7.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.2.1.
1.7.4.2. Pro: The justice system in the wizarding world is worse than that of the Muggle world.
1.7.4.2.1. Pro: The wizarding justice system supports punishments that the Muggle world would easily classify as 'cruel and unusual'.
1.7.4.2.1.1. Pro: The use of Dementors as prison guards is accepted, even though this effectively represents torture: they are meant to cause depression and destroy the souls of their victims.
1.7.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: The Dementors were furthermore used as executioners by administering the Dementor's Kiss. According to some, this fate is worse than death.
1.7.4.2.1.1.2. Con: [Experts](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/azkaban) in the magical world and proponents of Azkaban as the wizarding prison said that the only reason the Dementors stayed on the isolated island \(where they had been created\) was because they had souls to feed on. If the wizarding prison were shifted elsewhere and the Dementors were deprived of prisoners, they might abandon the prison and head for the mainland.
1.7.4.2.1.1.3. Con: The Ministry of Magic stopped the use of Dementors after the Second Wizarding War as they had previously proven not trustworthy and supported Lord Voldemort.
1.7.4.2.1.1.3.1. Con: The fact that the wizarding world ceased to use Dementors for pragmatic, rather than ethical, reasons indicates that the morality of the wizarding world is still bankrupt.
1.7.4.2.1.2. Pro: As head of Wizengamot, Barty Crouch Sr fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects.
1.7.4.2.1.2.1. Con: A lot of Muggle governments have suspended due process in times of emergency. This is not unique to the wizarding world.
1.7.4.2.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.4.1.1.
1.7.4.2.2. Pro: The wizarding justice system lacks due process.
1.7.4.2.2.1. Pro: In Britain, there are [no provisions to appeal](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/g00/wiki/Wizarding_world?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) decisions to higher courts after the Wizengamot has come to a decision.
1.7.4.2.2.2. Con: The Muggle justice system is more economically divisive than the wizarding equivalent.
1.7.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: In the Muggle system, the quality of representation a defendant gets depends on one's ability to pay for a good lawyer. Poor Muggles get incarcerated at higher rates and take worse plea deals because they cannot afford a good lawyer. The Wizengamot, by not allowing lawyers, makes sure that all who come before it have equal opportunity to defend themselves.
1.7.4.2.2.2.2. Pro: A [study](http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2010/05/unattractive-people-pay-price-court) that has found that unattractive Muggle defendants who cannot afford to dress well to court tend to get hit with longer, harsher sentences -- on average 22 months longer in prison.
1.7.4.2.2.2.2.1. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that jurors in the Wizengamot are immune to letting their personal biases dictate whether a defendant is innocent or guilty.
1.7.4.2.2.3. Pro: Despite the fact that he was innocent, Sirius Black was the victim of numerous miscarriages of justice.
1.7.4.2.2.3.1. Pro: Sirius Black's punishment was switched from life in Azkaban to being subjected to the Dementor's Kiss after he escaped. The punishment does not seem to fit the crime.
1.7.4.2.2.3.2. Pro: Barty Crouch Senior sentenced Sirius Black to life imprisonment in Azkaban without a trial. Sirius Black was later proved to be innocent.
1.7.4.2.2.4. Pro: Hagrid was ostracised and suspended from Hogwarts, then sent to Azkaban when Ginny Weasley was manipulated into opening the Chamber of Secrets, just because he was suspected of opening it the first time.
1.7.4.2.2.5. Pro: Newt Scamander and Tina Goldstein are sentenced to death without a trial, and without even being accused of any particularly grievous crimes.
1.7.4.2.2.6. Pro: No [wizarding lawyers](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wizengamot) seem to exist, and the practice of having a spokesperson on behalf of a defendant appears to be rare.
1.7.4.2.2.6.1. Con: Dumbledore acts as 'witness for the defence' in Harry's trial in front of the Wizengamot, a role which seems to be more like that of defence counsel.
1.7.4.2.2.6.1.1. Con: Dumbledore's actions on behalf of Harry are an exceptional circumstance. The concept of legal representation through lawyers is still informal and rare in the wizarding world.
1.7.4.2.2.6.2. Con: Rufus Scrimgeour asks Hermione if she is planning to follow a career in magical law suggesting that this career pathway does exist.
1.7.4.2.2.7. Pro: Newt Scamander and his companions are thrown directly into prison cells before they have a chance to plead their case to the Magical Congress of the United States of America.
1.7.4.2.2.8. Con: The Muggle world also has cases where innocent people spend a great deal of time in prison, and even innocent people can be sentenced to the death penalty.
1.7.4.2.2.8.1. Con: These Muggles still normally receive a fair trial beforehand to give them as much chance to prove their innocence as possible.
1.7.4.2.2.9. Con: The Muggle justice system is often regarded as racist, failing to follow due process and giving harsher punishments to people of colour.
1.7.4.2.3. Pro: There are tools that could be used to determine innocence or guilt - the Priori Incantatem incantation, legilimency, or Veritaserum -  but they are rarely used, and instead innocent people are convicted of crimes they did not commit.
1.7.4.2.3.1. Con: The use of Priori Incantatum may be able to identify the spells cast from a wand but cannot identify the wizard who cast them. As such, it cannot prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
1.7.4.2.3.2. Con: Veritaserum would constitute a severe violation of defendants' rights and due process. No-one should be forced to testify against him or herself.
1.7.4.2.3.2.1. Pro: The privilege against self-incrimination is a fundamental common law right protected in the [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_silence_in_England_and_Wales).
1.7.4.2.3.2.2. Con: Veritaserum could be used as a voluntary opt-in for people to prove their innocence.
1.7.4.2.3.2.2.1. Con: This would still skew the justice system in an unfair way: if defendants were allowed to use Veritaserum to prove their innocence, any defendant who chose not to would be presumed guilty.
1.7.4.2.3.2.3. Pro: The right against self-incrimination is part of the [US Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-incrimination).
1.7.4.2.3.2.3.1. Con: The giving of rights to citizens varies greatly from state to state and comes from years of discussion on what constitutes rights and how they are exercised. It is possible that the right against self-incrimination is one not afforded to individuals in the wizarding community.
1.7.4.2.3.2.3.1.1. Con: Even if it is not currently, the right against self-incrimination ought to be part of wizarding society, and forcing people to testify against themselves is a violation of their rights.
1.7.4.2.3.2.3.1.1.1. Con: This is an argument made from a Muggle perspective on what a rights framework ought to be. There is no 'best' or most 'correct' rights framework. It varies on a case by case basis, and the framework of rights established by wizards cannot be attacked as insufficient through a Muggle lens.
1.7.4.2.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.2.2.3.
1.7.4.2.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.2.2.4.
1.7.4.2.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.2.2.5.
1.7.4.2.3.6. Con: The practice of sending people to Azkaban without a trial was most common during the First Wizarding War and during the attacks on students at Hogwarts when the Ministry was under duress and strapped for resources.
1.7.4.2.3.6.1. Pro: Due process is sometimes also restricted in the Muggle world in times of declared National Emergencies. The conditions under which due process was suspended by the Ministry of Magic is analogous to such situations.
1.7.4.2.3.6.2. Con: The use of magical means of evidence gathering like Priori Incantatum or the administration of Veritaserum is quick and easy. It is irresponsible and morally reprehensible on the part of the Ministry to prosecute innocent people just to appear like it is fulfilling its responsibility to the public.
1.7.4.2.3.6.3. Con: Strained resources or duress are never an excuse for egregiously violating due process; even militaries in warzones have properly administrated trials.
1.7.4.2.4. Pro: The wizarding world does not separate its executive or legislative from its judicial branch.
1.7.4.2.4.1. Pro: The Wizengamot is wizarding Britain's high court of law and parliament. Its hearings are conducted in the Ministry of Magic itself - the legislative and executive body of Britain's wizarding world.
1.7.4.2.4.1.1. Pro: The Minister for Magic chairs the Wizengamot to pass Wizarding Laws, or to hear important trials.
1.7.4.2.4.1.1.1. Con: The final verdict is decided by the Wizengamot through a majority vote.
1.7.4.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: The Wizengamot was presided over by the Minister for Magic - the head of the executive branch of government - in the 1995 trial of Harry Potter.
1.7.4.2.4.2. Con: Due to the existence of magical methods of recalling memories and verifying the truthfulness of claims, the judicial system of the wizarding world does not need judicial independence in order to operate effectively.
1.7.4.2.4.2.1. Con: This might be the case in theory but in practice these methods are not actually used to determine innocence.
1.7.4.2.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.7.4.2.2.
1.7.4.2.4.3. Pro: The separation of powers is necessary to prevent abuse of power by those in government.
1.7.4.2.5. Con: The justice system in the wizarding world is perhaps worse than the British justice system, but the Muggle world is much larger than Britain and Ireland. There is no one type of Muggle justice system, and many Muggle countries have far worse systems in place.
1.7.4.2.6. Pro: The fact that there is no alternate prison means that everyone, no matter the severity of their crime, is sent to Azkaban, an isolated island with [Dementors](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dementor).
1.7.4.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.4.10.3.4.
1.7.4.2.6.2. Con: -> See 1.7.4.2.1.1.3.
1.7.4.2.6.3. Con: [After the International Statute of Secrecy had been imposed](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/azkaban), Ministry of Magic officials felt that the small wizarding prisons that existed throughout the country posed a security risk, because escape attempts often included noise and lights. They saw Azkaban as a proper prison on a remote island, and one that would help keep the wizarding world secret.
1.7.4.3. Pro: The wizarding world has confirmed, empirical evidence for the existence of souls and yet the general public accepts the destruction of the soul as a form of punishment.
1.7.4.3.1. Pro: [Ghosts](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ghosts) exist in in the wizarding world and interact with wizards.
1.7.4.3.1.1. Pro: Ghosts remember details from the life of their respective person, so they seem to be continuations of their consciousness.
1.7.4.3.1.2. Con: Ghosts have a very [reduced quality of life](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ghosts), as they are unable to experience physical pleasure and they only retain the level of knowledge that they had during their mortal life.
1.7.4.3.1.2.1. Con: Ghosts are still capable of thinking and interacting with people, which is superior to the nothingness of death.
1.7.4.3.1.2.1.1. Con: We cannot know that after death there is nothing, just as we cannot know that being a ghost is superior to what happens to wizards after death.
1.7.4.3.1.2.1.2. Con: If the people are aware of their diminished capacity, they might well find this worse than nothingness.
1.7.4.3.1.3. Con: It has been said that only those with [unfinished business](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ghosts) choose to come back as ghosts, while the wisest witches and wizards are more likely to embrace death.
1.7.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: Albus Dumbledore, one of the greatest of wizards, said "To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure."
1.7.4.3.1.3.2. Con: This implies that the wizarding world has an afterlife, so death in the wizarding world would be superior to death in the Muggle world after all.
1.7.4.3.1.3.2.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that Muggles don't also get to experience this implied afterlife.
1.7.4.3.1.4. Con: Wizards who become ghosts never get to experience or have knowledge of what happens after death.
1.7.4.3.1.4.1. Pro: For some ghosts the choice is regretted as they live in ignorance of what they gave up and with the knowledge of how much lesser a ghost's existence is as compared to a living persons.
1.7.4.3.1.4.2. Pro: Due to the fact that they will never experience what happens after death they will be forever left behind by those passing into the afterlife.
1.7.4.3.1.4.3. Con: It is never answered what happens after death and so we cannot be sure that ghosts are missing out. What happens after death may possibly be worse than life as a ghost.
1.7.4.3.1.4.3.1. Con: The torture of never knowing whether you made the correct choice for the entirety of your never-ending existence makes a ghost's life worse no matter what life after death is.
1.7.4.3.1.4.3.1.1. Con: Even if you choose to pass on, you would never know both sides of the choice. While as a mortal you would have seen and talked to ghosts, you would never have known what it is truly like to have been one. No matter which choice you make you will have to live with a certain amount of uncertainty.
1.7.4.3.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.7.4.3.1.3.2.
1.7.4.3.1.4.5. Con: This is still a better situation than that in the Muggle world because at least wizards are offered the choice of continuing on as ghosts whereas Muggles are forced to move on to what is beyond.
1.7.4.3.2. Con: Unless one is proposing the genocide of Dementors, one must accept that some souls will be destroyed in order for Dementors to be able to consume what appears to be their only food.
1.7.4.3.2.1. Pro: Former Minister for Magic Eldritch Diggory formed a committee to find alternative solutions to Dementors in Azkaban. This was met with strong opposition because people feared a mainland invasion by the dark creatures if they were deprived of their [only food source](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dementor).
1.7.4.3.2.2. Con: Genocide requires a hostile intention. In this case, the death of Dementors would merely be the result of protecting human beings from unacceptable suffering. This harm could, thus, be inflicted on Dementors without any hostile intention at all.
1.7.4.3.2.2.1. Con: Regardless of the intent, if we deny food for Dementors in the knowledge that it will cause their extinction then this is still wrong.
1.7.4.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: The magical world strives to find an appropriate balance by only giving to the Dementors those who are most deserving of this punishment.
1.7.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.2.1.1.
1.7.5. Pro: In Great Britain, the Ministry of Magic has authoritarian tendencies.
1.7.5.1. Pro: Political parties do not appear to exist in the wizarding world.
1.7.5.1.1. Con: While political parties don't exist, political lobbying groups, like [SPEW](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Society_for_the_Promotion_of_Elfish_Welfare), aim to ensure the interests of various groups are heard.
1.7.5.2. Pro: The Ministry of Magic controls everything, from banks to schools to law enforcement to journalism.
1.7.5.2.1. Pro: Most lucrative careers in the wizarding world are with the government - auror, journalist, professor, bureaucrat - and are awarded to those with favorable political affiliations.
1.7.5.2.1.1. Pro: Dolores Umbridge receives repeated appointments \(Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Hogwarts High Inquisitor\) not because of her qualifications, but because of her loyalty to Fudge.
1.7.5.2.1.2. Con: Journalists in the wizarding world do not work for the government; the Daily Prophet and other publications are independent.
1.7.5.2.1.2.1. Con: The Daily Prophet has [strong ties with the Ministry of Magic](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Daily_Prophet), and has been used during Ministry campaigns to do things such as discredit Dumbledore and Harry Potter when they claimed Voldemort had returned.
1.7.5.2.1.2.1.1. Con: There are some smaller alternative newspapers such as [The Quibbler.](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/The_Quibbler)
1.7.5.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: When the Daily Prophet refuses to print certain information, the popularity of these smaller newspapers grows. If the Daily Prophet does not do its job effectively, people will go elsewhere.
1.7.5.2.2. Con: The institution of Hogwarts successfully resisted numerous attempts by the Ministry of Magic to impose new educational guidelines, particularly those attempted by Dolores Umbridge.
1.7.5.2.2.1. Con: Umbridge successfully implemented many of her reforms and even briefly rose to the position of Headmistress. Were it not for the reappearance of Voldemort at the Ministry, these would have likely stayed in place.
1.7.5.2.2.2. Pro: Even while Umbridge was in full control of the school, teachers subtly [assisted](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge) in pranks against her and students [taught themselves](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army).
1.7.5.2.3. Con: The banks of the wizarding world are depicted as being controlled by the Goblins who are skilled at using magical and biological capabilities to deter outsider control of the wizarding banking system.
1.7.5.2.4. Pro: There is only one wizarding newspaper in England - the Daily Prophet - and it reports on gossip in addition to news. It is also susceptible to pressure from the Minister for Magic to print or not to print information.
1.7.5.2.4.1. Pro: One newspaper means that different political views are not represented in the wizarding world and there is no proper scrutiny of government.
1.7.5.2.4.2. Pro: Under pressure from the Ministry, The Daily Prophet tries its best to ruin Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore's reputations when they try to warn the wizarding world about the second coming of Voldemort.
1.7.5.2.4.3. Con: -> See 1.7.5.2.1.2.1.1.
1.7.5.2.4.4. Pro: Cornelius Fudge prevents the Daily Prophet from printing news about Voldemort's return.
1.7.5.3. Pro: There are few checks or balances on the power of the Ministry of Magic or the Minister for Magic, and no one within the ministry disputes official policy.
1.7.5.3.1. Pro: The Ministry of Magic has proven to be incompetent many times.
1.7.5.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.
1.7.5.3.1.2. Pro: When Voldemort returns, kills the Minister for Magic and replaces him with Pius Thicknesse, the entire government follows Thicknesse's orders, even though the orders are violent, racist and insane.
1.7.5.3.1.2.1. Pro: Thicknesse, at Voldemort's direction, installed a new regime at the Ministry that was more in line with Death Eater ideology.
1.7.5.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Thicknesse appointed known Death Eaters with criminal records to important offices.
1.7.5.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Death Eaters [Travers and Selwyn](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/g00/wiki/Pius_Thicknesse?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F), were appointed to other powerful positions within the Ministry Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
1.7.5.3.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Corban Yaxley was appointed head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
1.7.5.3.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: Then Death Eater, Severus Snape, was appointed Headmaster of Hogwarts.
1.7.5.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: Pius Thicknesse enacted policies that perpetuated hatred against all wizards of Muggle ancestry and the Muggle community itself.
1.7.5.3.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.4.1.
1.7.5.3.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Thicknesse had a statue depicting a witch and wizard on top of a throne made from the bodies of crude-looking Muggles, inscribed with the motto "Magic is Might" set up in the Ministry Atrium, replacing the earlier Fountain of Magical Brethren.
1.7.5.3.1.2.1.3. Pro: Public dissent was unjustly cracked down upon under Thicknesse's regime.
1.7.5.3.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Xenophilius Lovegood's daughter, Luna, was kidnapped in order to stop his telling the truth to the public and encouraging support of Harry Potter in his magazine, The Quibbler.
1.7.5.3.1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Xenophilius was later arrested and imprisoned without trial.
1.7.5.3.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Known Order of the Phoenix members or those with sympathies for Muggles, such as Arthur Weasley, were put under Ministry surveillance.
1.7.5.3.1.2.2. Pro: Under Thicknesse, Hogwarts school policy was changed to better align with Dark ideology.
1.7.5.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.12.2.
1.7.5.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.3.1.2.1.1.3.
1.7.5.3.1.2.2.3. Pro: Unlike previously, Hogwarts attendance became compulsory and Muggle-borns were rusticated following a blood purity check.
1.7.5.3.1.2.2.4. Pro: Death Eaters Amycus and Alecto Carrow were appointed to teach the Dark Arts and prejudiced depictions of Muggles.
1.7.5.3.1.2.3. Con: The problems that are seen in the Thicknesse Ministry have been seen countless times in dictatorial regimes throughout human history. They are a problem of dictatorships and not magic.
1.7.5.3.1.3. Pro: The wizarding world takes International Statute of Secrecy very seriously and yet the department that deals with Muggles, [Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Misuse_of_Muggle_Artefacts_Office), is underfunded and has only two people.
1.7.5.3.1.4. Pro: Many wizards were able to escape and hide from the Ministry easily.
1.7.5.3.1.4.1. Pro: There have been at least [five](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Azkaban_escapes) occasions in which prisoners have escaped from Azkaban despite it being considered inescapable.
1.7.5.3.1.4.2. Pro: Dumbledore was able to escape from his office at Hogwarts after knocking out Ministry wizards.
1.7.5.3.1.4.2.1. Con: The fact that one of the world's most powerful wizards cannot be stopped by a few lower ones is not necessarily testament to the Ministry's incompetence but rather Dumbledore's strength.
1.7.5.3.1.4.2.2. Con: One of the Ministry wizards who was trying to apprehend Dumbledore was [Kingsley Shacklebolt](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Kingsley_Shacklebolt), one of Dumbledore's closest allies.
1.7.5.3.1.4.3. Pro: Sirius Black was able to escape from Ministry officials and remain in hiding successfully.
1.7.5.3.1.4.4. Pro: Voldemort was able to hide for years from the Ministry.
1.7.5.3.1.4.4.1. Con: It was Voldemort's followers inside the Ministry, rather than institutional incompetence, that allowed him to evade capture.
1.7.5.3.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: The Ministry tried to maintain a facade of stability after Voldemort's rise after the Triwizard Tournament. Voldemort took advantage of this attitude to evade capture.
1.7.5.3.1.4.4.1.2. Con: The fact that the Ministry was able to be corrupted is a sign of its incompetence in itself.
1.7.5.3.1.4.4.1.3. Con: The Ministry of Magic led by [Cornelius Fudge](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge) systematically denied and made no effort to verify Voldemort's return even though there were credible witnesses like Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore attesting to the contrary.
1.7.5.3.1.4.4.2. Pro: After his fall to the baby Harry Potter, Voldemort was able to evade the Ministry of Magic effectively because the Ministry was not aware of his Horcruxes and he was presumed dead.
1.7.5.3.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.2.4.1.
1.7.5.3.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.3.1.4.4.1.3.
1.7.5.3.2. Pro: There is no opposition party, like exists in almost all Muggle governments, to question laws passed by the government and hold the government accountable for promises made to the community.
1.7.5.3.3. Pro: The Ministry is very susceptible to corruption.
1.7.5.3.3.1. Pro: The awarding of the [Order of Merlin](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/order-of-merlin) is not always based on merit. Sometimes it is due to the recipient's position within the Ministry or their wealth.
1.7.5.3.3.1.1. Con: Many honorifics in the Muggle world are subject to the same problem. This is not unique to the wizarding world.
1.7.5.3.3.1.2. Pro: [Cornelius Fudge](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/order-of-merlin) awarded himself the Order of Merlin, First Class, for a career few considered distinguished.
1.7.5.3.3.1.3. Pro: [Arcturus Black](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/order-of-merlin), Sirius Black's grandfather, was widely believed to have bought his Order of Merlin by loaning the Ministry a large amount of gold.
1.7.5.3.3.1.4. Pro: The Ministry of Magic considered removing [Albus Dumbledore](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Order_of_Merlin)'s Order of Merlin as part of a campaign to discredit him because he disagreed with Cornelius Fudge.
1.7.5.3.3.2. Pro: Voldemort managed to take control of the Ministry without anyone knowing, by putting [Pius Thicknesse](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Pius_Thicknesse) under the Imperius Curse when he was Minister for Magic.
1.7.5.3.4. Con: Ministers for Magic can be ousted by votes of no confidence.
1.7.5.3.4.1. Con: This is used in the most extreme circumstances and is usually not used as a threat to keep a check on the Minister's abuse of power.
1.7.5.3.4.2. Pro: Cornelius Fudge was removed from his position as Minister for Magic through a vote of no confidence.
1.7.5.4. Pro: Heads of Ministry Departments \(which appear to be equivalent to Muggle government Ministers\) are not elected representatives of the people.
1.7.5.4.1. Con: This is also the case in the US Muggle system which would generally be seen as very democratic.
1.7.5.5. Con: The authoritarian methods of the Ministry are legitimized by its ongoing success: for the most part, it has kept Muggles safe from wizards and the other way around.
1.7.5.5.1. Con: The Ministry did not prevent three [Wizarding Wars](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wizarding_Wars) which killed many wizards and Muggles.
1.7.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.2.4.
1.7.5.7. Con: There is no real public resentment against the actions of the Ministry.
1.7.5.7.1. Con: This might be due to an uneducated wizarding public: political education seems to play no role whatsoever in schools and wizards seem to be largely ignorant of political systems other than their own \(like those of Muggles\).
1.7.5.7.2. Con: -> See 1.7.5.3.2.
1.7.5.8. Con: While there are no term limits, the Minister for Magic is obliged to hold [elections](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ministers-for-magic) at least every seven years.
1.7.5.8.1. Con: Seven years is a very long term, and makes democratic accountability weak.
1.7.5.9. Con: The Ministers for Magic are [held accountable](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ministers-for-magic) by the wizarding populace. Throughout history, Ministers who have pursued unpopular agendas have been ousted.
1.7.6. Con: That wizards and witches buy in to wizarding society rather than abandoning the state or living amongst Muggles suggests that it is either not that bad, or that the upsides are worth it.
1.7.6.1. Con: Groups the Ministry of Magic actively discriminates against, including goblins, elves, and centaurs, have no practical options other than being subject to this system.
1.7.6.2. Con: This is a not a reasonable choice that wizards could ever take.
1.7.6.2.1. Pro: Most wizards are unfamiliar with the Muggle world, and would have no idea how to effectively integrate into it once they are old enough to make the choice.
1.7.6.2.2. Pro: Given the amount of stigma associated with being a Muggle, and all the social connections that they develop in growing up in the wizarding world, it seems unlikely that a wizard could ever actively make the choice to renounce their own community and join the Muggles.
1.8. Con: The wizarding world displays immense moral negligence by refusing to help solve the problems of the Muggle world.
1.8.1. Con: For someone living in the wizarding world this is not necessarily a problem. To the contrary, it spares wizards from dealing with many of the problems that Muggles face.
1.8.2. Pro: Spells could be used quickly to wash, fold and provide blankets and other needed items to homeless people, charities, and towns or states following disasters.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Magic could compensate for the [lack of social workers](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/lack-of-social-workers-puts-vulnerable-children-at-risk-9947500.html), [funding](http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/budget-cuts-might-hit-less-obvious-social-services/) or infrastructure that is endemic to a lot of Muggle social service systems.
1.8.3. Con: If the wizarding world magically solved Muggles' problems for them, then Muggles would become reliant on magical solutions instead of attempting to solve their own problems.
1.8.3.1. Con: Every human doesn't have every skill possible. We already rely on each other.
1.8.4. Pro: Revealing magic to Muggle scientists could result in huge technological advancements that could massively increase the prosperity of the Muggle world.
1.8.4.1. Con: Magic does not obey the scientific laws that govern the Muggle world. It is therefore unlikely that Muggle scientists would ever be able to understand or implement magic in a way that solves Muggle problems.
1.8.5. Pro: Wizards could solve almost all non-war humanitarian crises.
1.8.5.1. Pro: Wizards can [multiply and enlarge](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Gamp%27s_Law_of_Elemental_Transfiguration) existing food; they thus have the capacity to solve all major famines, but fail to do so.
1.8.5.1.1. Con: We [already grow enough food](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-holt-gimenez/world-hunger_b_1463429.html) to feed ten billion people, yet one billion are hungry. Clearly, the amount of food is not the issue.
1.8.5.1.1.1. Con: Even if we could in principle distribute existing food to feed everyone who is hungry, creating more food is an alternative, easier way of solving starvation that does not require systematically reforming the world economy.
1.8.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Accepting the existence and use of magic would require systematically reforming the way in which all Muggles see and interact with the world, which is even more challenging than reforming economic policy.
1.8.5.2. Pro: Wizards could multiply the supply of vaccines, mosquito nets, and other essential items that people living in poverty in low-income countries need.
1.8.5.3. Pro: Magic could help mitigate and manage the effects of natural disasters.
1.8.5.3.1. Pro: The [Reductor Curse](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Reductor_Curse) or [Shrinking Charm](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/g00/wiki/Shrinking_Charm?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) could be used to easily get rid of the debris caused by natural disasters, which otherwise takes months to get rid of by Muggle means.
1.8.5.3.2. Pro: Magic could be used to strengthen buildings and homes against the effects of natural disasters. This could save lives and millions in property damage caused by disasters.
1.8.5.3.3. Pro: [The Vanishing Spell](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Vanishing_Spell) could be used to get rid of toxic waste spills that pollute the planet.
1.8.5.3.4. Pro: The [Aqua Eructo](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Aqua_Eructo_Charm) charm creates fresh water out of nothing, and could thus be used to alleviate droughts.
1.8.5.4. Con: There would still be a great deal of inequality that magic alone cannot solve. Exceptions to [Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration](http://www.beyondhogwarts.com/harry-potter/articles/the-five-principal-exceptions-to-gamps-law.html) include food and money, which cannot be created out of thin air.
1.8.5.4.1. Con: Food cannot be created out of thin air, but already existing food can be multiplied or magically transported from one place to another.
1.8.5.4.1.1. Pro: Wizards can increase the food they have through the Engorgement Charm. Hagrid does this with vegetables on the Hogwarts grounds.
1.8.6. Pro: Wizards could prevent anyone from ever being wrongfully imprisoned by supplying Muggle justice systems with Veritaserum.
1.8.6.1. Con: -> See 1.7.4.2.3.2.
1.8.6.2. Con: The victim states what only they [believe](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Veritaserum) to be true, so the victim's sanity and perception of reality also factors in during interrogations. Therefore, while the drinker's answers are sincere, they are not necessarily true.
1.8.7. Pro: The wizarding world's failure to aid the Muggle world shows a systematic callousness and refusal to care about the plight of vulnerable people. This makes it an undesirable place to live.
1.8.7.1. Con: Wizards have a good reason for not solving the problems of the Muggle world: they see continued secrecy as key to their survival.
1.8.7.1.1. Pro: Muggles are hostile to what they do not understand.
1.8.7.1.2. Con: Whether or not they have a good reason is irrelevant - the fact of the matter is that continued secrecy makes the wizarding world a paranoid, unpleasant place to live.
1.8.7.1.3. Con: Wizards could alleviate the problems of the Muggle world while remaining in secret.
1.8.7.1.3.1. Pro: Wizards could create Muggle companies or NGOs as fronts to distribute magically created food in famines.
1.8.7.1.3.1.1. Con: Wizarding culture is too different from Muggle culture for them to be able to run a public institution such as an international NGO while at the same time being able to withstand the public scrutiny that comes with it.
1.8.7.1.3.2. Pro: If wizards were able to use magic to reverse things such as the effects of climate change, then they could likely do so without being detected by Muggles.
1.8.7.1.3.2.1. Con: The study of climate change relies on empirical scientific evidence. If climate change began to reverse without any apparent causation it would arouse concern in Muggle scientists.
1.8.7.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Given most Muggles currently don't believe in magic, it is unlikely that such concern would lead them to the suspicion of magic being the cause.
1.8.7.1.4. Pro: Not only would extermination of the wizarding world be a threat to wizards themselves, but it would remove the ability of wizards to help Muggles. So if this fear were accurate, helping Muggles would be self-defeating, so wizards have good reason not to help them.
1.8.7.1.5. Con: The wizarding world would easily survive exposure to, and harm from, the Muggle world.
1.8.7.1.5.1. Pro: It was [possible](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Witch_Burning_in_the_Fourteenth_Century_Was_Completely_Pointless_%E2%80%94_discuss) to avoid witch burnings. Witches and wizards could perform a charm to neutralize the flames and then stand within the fires set for them, feeling nothing but “a gentle tickling sensation”.
1.8.7.1.5.2. Pro: The domain of the magical community is often not present to Muggles at all.
1.8.7.1.5.2.1. Pro: Platform 9 3/4, Grimmauld Place and Hogwarts are all invisible to Muggles.
1.8.7.1.5.3. Con: Wizards' enchantments and protections are designed to withstand magic and magical attacks. It is possible that wizards would have no idea how to defend themselves from Muggle bombs or other weapons.
1.8.7.1.5.3.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that magical protections that withstand powerful magical attacks would not be able to be adapted, or used in their current form, to withstand Muggle attacks from Muggle weaponry.
1.8.7.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Most Muggle weaponry requires causing physical harm which could easily be stopped by a magical barrier. For example, projectiles like bullets or crossbows could be Transfigured into something harmless or levitated away and knife blades could be made to disappear and their wounds easily healed.
1.8.7.1.5.4. Pro: Wizards can travel instantly, use magic to multiply or transport their possessions, and hide easily. Even if the Muggle world attacked them, they would easily survive.
1.8.7.1.5.4.1. Con: Even if wizards could individually survive a Muggle attack on the wizarding world by constantly relocating or hiding, it would totally destroy wizarding society and institutions. Fear of this is a sufficient reason to remain in secret.
1.8.7.1.6. Pro: Historically, witches and wizards were burned at the stake for fear of their powers.
1.8.8. Pro: Wizards could prevent the cruelties of animal farming from being necessary by multiplying existing quantities of meat.
1.8.8.1. Con: It is unknown as to whether or not the Gemino Curse can duplicate living or sentient beings. Additionally, only the original caster could stop the multiplication of the object, which could get tricky.[Harry Potter Wiki](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Gemino_Curse)
1.8.8.2. Con: By that logic, there is a lot that Muggles could do to reduce suffering of animals in the wild as well.
1.8.9. Pro: Magic could offer a source of clean, renewable energy.
1.8.9.1. Pro: Magic can produce heat and fire without using electricity or energy.
1.8.9.2. Pro: It is possible that magic would allow us to access this renewable energy at a fraction of the current cost, making it an appealing alternative and allowing for a great reduction in carbon emissions which contribute to climate change.
1.8.9.3. Pro: Magic can provide light without using electricity or energy.
1.8.9.4. Pro: Cars can be enchanted so they could run without fuel like how Arthur Weasley and Sirius Black enchanted their car and motorbikes respectively to fly.
1.8.9.5. Pro: Wizards can multiply the supply of existing sources of energy, like solar panels or batteries.
1.8.9.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.11.8.7.1.1.
1.8.10. Con: Periodically through history wizards have aided the Muggle world when the situation was dire.
1.8.10.1. Con: Where wizards did get involved, it was for self-interest \(liking one side more, or not wanting their home to be conquered\) rather than humanitarian reasons.
1.8.10.2. Pro: During the Muggle First World War, thousands of witches and wizards aided Muggles, defying Ministry legislation forbidding involvement.
1.8.10.3. Pro: During the [American Revolutionary War](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/macusa), the American magical community aided the colonists in their fight for independence.
1.8.10.4. Pro: The British possibly received magical help to win the [Crimean War](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ministers-for-magic) \(1853-1856.\)
1.8.10.5. Con: Becoming involved in Muggle wars does not help Muggles on the whole, but just privileges one group of Muggles over another.
1.8.11. Con: Muggles have the capability to solve their own problems and yet are unwilling to do so. It is unlikely that wizards would be able to force them.
1.8.11.1. Con: It may not be a matter of forcing them if Muggles are able to see how easily problems can be solved with the use of magic.
1.8.11.1.1. Con: Just because something has clear benefits does not mean that people automatically accept it; many medical treatments are refused by people for a variety of reasons.
1.8.11.2. Pro: Solving large scale problems in the Muggle world involves solving bureaucracy created by Muggle political and economic institutions that cannot be overcome with magic.
1.8.12. Con: -> See 1.8.7.1.
1.9. Pro: The magical world opens up possibilities of extending one's life and of experiencing some form of life after death.
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.3.1.
1.9.2. Con: Most of the options to extend one's life are extreme, such as in the form of creating Horcruxes. Alternatively, they only give a person a partial life, which may well be a worse option than death.
1.9.3. Pro: [The Philosopher's Stone](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone), created by Nicolas Flamel, can be used to create the Elixir of Life which can extend the lifespan of those who drink it indefinitely.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel both lived to more than 650 years old, and only died after Nicolas agreed to destroy the stone.
1.9.3.2. Con: [The stone was destroyed in 1991](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone) as Dumbledore and Flamel thought it was necessary to stop it falling into the wrong hands after Voldemort had begun a quest to obtain it.
1.9.3.2.1. Con: The stone was not necessarily unique, it could be created again by an alchemist equal to Flamel's skill.
1.9.3.3. Con: The fact that the stone was highly sought after by a dangerous wizard shows that people will go to extreme measures to get access to life expanding magic, meaning it could cause serious problems.
1.9.4. Con: Expanding life expectancy or living forever may not necessarily be a good thing.
1.9.4.1. Con: Longer life expectancies would give people the opportunity to pursue longer-term projects, and discourage short-term hedonism.
1.9.4.2. Con: The wizarding world offers a choice to extend one's life. People for whom a short lifespan makes life meaningful can choose not to extend their life, while people who do desire longer lifespans can make the opposite choice.
1.9.4.2.1. Con: Choosing not to extend one's life will also be a difficult choice to make due to the high quality of life offered in the wizarding world and the connections that are formed with people.
1.9.4.3. Pro: Population control would be a serious problem if people were to live forever, or even for a significantly longer period than they do now.
1.9.4.3.1. Pro: Immortality would require either severely limiting people's procreative rights, or dealing with an endlessly expanding population.
1.9.4.3.1.1. Con: Most wizards don't choose to seek immortality so it would be unlikely to affect population size greatly.
1.9.4.3.2. Con: Given the relative size of the wizarding community, this is unlikely to have a major impact on population control.
1.9.4.4. Pro: Death is a natural part of the human condition; cheating death is wrong.
1.9.4.5. Pro: People are inspired to make the best of their lives because they know that one day, it will end. Cheating death would take away the primary motivation human beings have to do anything productive.
1.9.4.6. Con: A person could spend an infinite amount of time pursuing their dreams or doing what they love if they had the opportunity to live forever.
1.9.4.6.1. Pro: Many people have more than one dream for a career or life they may lead. Having this time would allow them to live out many different career and life paths that may give them great utility.
1.9.4.6.2. Pro: Many people realize after years of working in a particular field that they are better equipped to work in, or are more passionate about, another field. Living longer would allow easier transitions to other fields of work and lead to greater happiness among working individuals.
1.9.4.6.3. Pro: A lot of people are not able to pursue their fields of interests due to financial or familial pressures while growing up. An infinite time to pursue interests would give people the time to fulfill those obligations before moving on to something that truly makes them happy.
1.9.4.7. Pro: Life is special because of the people we share it with. With an expanded life expectancy or immortality, you would watch everyone you cared about die.
1.9.4.7.1. Con: Most wizards' loved ones are also wizards so also have expanded life expectancy and the possibility of immortality.
1.9.4.7.1.1. Con: This is increasingly untrue as the number of half-bloods and Muggle-borns grows.
1.9.4.7.2. Pro: Love is considered the most powerful branch of magic. To live forever would mean living without one's loved ones.
1.9.4.8. Pro: Life has meaning because of its brevity. If people lived forever, that meaning would be lost.
1.9.5. Pro: [Horcruxes](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Horcrux) are objects in which individuals can hide pieces of their soul with the object of achieving immortality. Voldemort successfully split his soul into eight pieces.
1.9.5.1. Con: Splitting the soul is nearly irreversible; the only way to make it whole again is for the wizard to truly feel remorse for the murder committed, the pain of which is so great it could kill them.
1.9.5.2. Con: Splitting the soul is warned against in Adalbert Waffling's [First Fundamental Law Of Magic](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Fundamental_Laws_of_Magic).
1.9.5.3. Con: It is difficult for the part of the soul encased in a Horcrux to regain a physical body after the 'main' part of the soul's death. If it does not regain a physical body it continues to exist only in an incorporeal form.
1.9.5.4. Con: Creating a Horcrux is a very difficult act of magic, and only very few wizards are capable of doing it.
1.9.5.5. Con: People who have Horcruxes can still ultimately die if the Horcruxes are destroyed, such as in the case of Voldemort.
1.9.5.5.1. Pro: If the Horcrux is destroyed and the person does die, they appear to become trapped in [limbo](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Limbo).
1.9.5.6. Con: Creating a [Horcrux](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Horcrux) requires the person to commit murder in order to split the soul.
1.9.6. Pro: Many wizards and witches continue to live to some extent through their portraits and are able to interact with people who are still alive.
1.9.6.1. Pro: Even though Harry Potter was orphaned as a baby, he was able to keep the memories he had with his parents through the moving portraits in the photo album Hagrid gave him.
1.9.6.2. Pro: Hogwarts' past Headmasters and Headmistresses live on in their [portraits](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/hogwarts-portraits) in the current Headmaster's office.
1.9.6.2.1. Pro: [Headmasters' portraits](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Headmaster_portraits) are painted long before the Headmaster dies, and are kept in a cupboard in the castle so that the Headmaster can teach their portrait to speak and act like them.
1.9.6.2.1.1. Pro: Headmasters can share specific knowledge and information with their portrait that can then be passed on generations after their death.
1.9.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: Albus Dumbledore visited his [portrait](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore%27s_portrait) regularly to teach it to talk and behave like him.
1.9.6.2.2. Con: Magical portraits such as those at [Hogwarts](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/hogwarts-portraits) do not provide a full way for people to live on, as they only represent the person as seen by the artist.
1.9.6.3. Con: The degree to which a portrait can interact with the person looking at them depends on the power they possessed when alive.
1.9.6.4. Con: The creation of a portrait of a wizard is not comparable to that wizard surviving after death. Rather, it is the creation of a simplistic clone of that wizard.
1.9.6.4.1. Pro: [Portraits](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Portrait) are only portrayals of the artist's impression of the subject, not accurate representations of the subject themself, and they lack the memories or knowledge of the subject.
1.9.6.4.2. Pro: For example, some wizards, [like Hogwarts headmasters](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Portrait), have portraits created for them when they are already alive. Clearly, in that case, the portrait is not a continuation of the wizard's consciousness, since both exist at the same time.
1.9.7. Con: That the majority of wizards and witches do not go to great lengths to experience life after death suggests that doing so is difficult, unrewarding, or risky.
1.9.8. Pro: Fable suggests that if a person were to obtain all three of the [Deathly Hallows](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Deathly_Hallows), they would become the master of death.
1.9.8.1. Con: Only one wizard can possess the Hallows, and the probability of managing to be that one wizard is fantastically low.
1.9.8.2. Con: It is only according to fable that possession of these items can allow one to avoid death.
1.9.8.3. Con: It has been suggested that being the [true Master of Death](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Deathly_Hallows) does not mean accomplishing immortality, but accepting that death is inevitable.
1.9.8.4. Pro: The [Elder Wand](https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/elder-wand) is a very powerful wand which can aid its bearer in their attempt to become Master of Death.
1.9.8.4.1. Con: The Elder Wand has a bloody history for its owners who are regularly murdered for it.
1.9.8.5. Pro: The [Invisibility Cloak](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Cloak_of_Invisibility) renders whoever is under it completely invisible. The Deathly Hallows fable suggests this would allow a person to hide from death.
1.9.8.5.1. Con: The Cloak does not act as a shield against spells, curses, or hexes aimed at the user. It only hides the wearer from sight.
1.9.8.5.1.1. Pro: Harry is affected by the Full Body-Bind Curse while under the invisibility cloak.
1.9.8.5.2. Pro: Unlike other invisibility cloaks that have been created, which tend to lose their magic over time and become patchy in terms of hiding the wearer, the invisibility cloak that Harry Potter owns and which is believed to be a Deathly Hallow, never loses its powers.
1.9.8.6. Pro: The [Resurrection Stone](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Resurrection_Stone) temporarily brings back the spirits of the holder's dead loved ones.
1.9.8.6.1. Con: Harry Potter dropped the stone in a forest as he did not want it. It is unclear where it is now and whether another such stone has ever been created.
1.9.8.6.1.1. Con: The stone has the Deathly Hallows symbol etched upon it, making it recognisable. It is possible that it will one day be found again.
1.9.8.6.1.1.1. Con: Given the size of the Forbidden Forest relative to the stone and conditions of general wear and tear likely in the Forest, the probability of the stone ever being found again are next to none.
1.9.8.6.2. Con: The spirits are uncomfortable in the land of the living.
1.9.8.6.2.1. Pro: Cadmus Peverell used the Stone to attempt to bring back a girl he had loved and was prepared to marry before her untimely death. While he was able to bring back a shade of her, he felt as though a "veil" separated them, and he could tell that she was suffering greatly from being forced back among the world of the living.
1.9.8.6.3. Con: The Resurrection Stone does not resurrect actual life but rather echoes of the loved ones' spirits.
1.9.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.6.2.
1.9.10. Pro: -> See 1.5.7.3.2.
1.10. Pro: The wizarding world is safer than the Muggle world.
1.10.1. Con: The wizarding world is more prone to internal warfare than the Muggle world.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Due to the lack of a distinction between military and non-military wizards, wizarding wars are a threat to all wizards.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: On average, [about 50%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualty_ratio) of casualties in Muggle wars are civilians, so these wars are still a threat to all Muggles.
1.10.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.2.1.
1.10.1.3. Con: The Muggle world experiences large-scale wars frequently.
1.10.2. Con: The wizarding world is just as dangerous as the muggle world, maybe even more so as it has more ways to kill someone when the wizard is knowledgeable with things from the muggle world, as Harry Potter and Hermione Granger do.
1.10.3. Pro: Wizards can easily Apparate away from positions of danger.
1.10.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.2.
1.10.3.2. Con: The act of Apparition in a state where the wizard is under pressure and is unable to fully concentrate can be terribly painful and dangerous.
1.10.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.2.1.
1.10.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.3.
1.10.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.9.
1.10.5. Con: -> See 1.3.5.2.5.
1.10.6. Con: -> See 1.5.6.
1.10.7. Pro: The wizarding world does not seem to experience humanitarian crises like famines or disease epidemics.
1.10.7.1. Pro: Preventable diseases, lack of access to clean water, and famine are among the [leading causes of death](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/index1.html) in the Muggle world.
1.10.8. Con: Magic is often dangerous to the user.
1.10.8.1. Pro: There are documented cases of flawed or broken wands causing spells to backfire on their users.
1.10.8.1.1. Pro: Ronald Weasley’s [wand](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Ronald_Weasley%27s_first_wand) started malfunctioning after he broke it. When he attempted to hex Draco Malfoy, the spell backfired and caused Ron to vomit slugs. Ron also injured Seamus Finnigan by mistake during the first meeting of the Duelling Club.
1.10.8.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.3.1.
1.10.8.1.3. Con: Wands are dangerous objects, and similar objects like guns, knives or machinery could cause serious injury or even death in the Muggle world if mishandled or used when damaged.
1.10.8.2. Con: Hogwarts students are banned from using magic outside of the supervised environment of the classroom.
1.10.8.2.1. Con: These rules are flouted by the vast majority of students and, in many cases, teachers wilfully fail to enforce them.
1.10.8.2.1.1. Pro: Hermione Granger successfully brewed polyjuice potion in a girls bathroom without being caught or punished. She, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley all took the potion.
1.10.8.2.1.2. Pro: Professor Slughorn saw Ginny [hex](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Bat-Bogey_Hex) Zacharias Smith on the Hogwarts Express and, instead of punishing her, invited her to join his club.
1.10.8.2.1.3. Pro: When Hermione Granger's teeth were enlarged by Draco Malfoy's [hex](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Densaugeo), Professor Snape openly refused to acknowledge it or punish the culprit.
1.10.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.7.2.1.
1.10.8.4. Pro: The Ministry of Magic has a [Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_Magical_Accidents_and_Catastrophes), suggesting they have to deal with both on a somewhat frequent basis.
1.10.9. Pro: The wizarding world has access to magical [healthcare](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Healing_magic), which is far superior to Muggle healthcare.
1.10.9.1. Pro: Magical healthcare also appears to be far more readily available than Muggle healthcare. There is no canonical evidence of people in the wizarding world suffering from long-term lack of care due to financial impediments.
1.10.9.1.1. Pro: The Weasley family is well known for being poor, but have no trouble accessing the best healthcare in the wizarding world, despite a lot of family members \(Ron, Arthur, George\) needing serious medical attention.
1.10.9.2. Pro: Wizard healing can cure any ["normal" illness](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/illness-and-disability) \(any illness Muggles might contract\).
1.10.9.3. Con: While magical healing can cure "normal" illnesses, illness or injury [of a magical nature](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/illness-and-disability) can be much more dangerous. Broken bones can be easily cured, but the consequence of a curse or magic back-firing can be much more serious.
1.10.9.3.1. Pro: Even the best wizarding hospitals cannot cure many magical afflictions; for example, the insanity of Frank and Alice Longbottom.
1.10.9.4. Pro: Magical creatures can also be used to provide cures to some illnesses and injuries.
