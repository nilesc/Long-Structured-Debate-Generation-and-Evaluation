1. Should PDA be allowed in middle school and high school?
1.1. Pro: You can let significant other know your affection without talking or disrupting the class.
1.2. Con: Students may get carried away and take things too far.
1.3. Pro: People who may like you would know that you are taken and will not try to flirt with you or ask you out. This would avoid the ever so awkward ‘I’m taken’ speech.
1.4. Con: Some parents may not be comfortable with their child holding hands or putting arms over the shoulders of their significant other.
1.5. Con: A student may lose their attention for the lesson and pay attention to significant other.
1.6. Pro: Attitudes will improve majorly among the students as to the fact that they would have a feeling of safeness in today’s dangerous world.
1.7. Pro: This would also be an optional thing. If a parent feels uncomfortable with their child physically showing affection then that would still be prevented. If the parents are ok with small things such as holding hands then it would be left alone.
