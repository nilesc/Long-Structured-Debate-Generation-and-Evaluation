Discussion Title: Catalans should have the right to decide on independence with a binding referendum

1. Catalans should have the right to decide on independence with a binding referendum
1.1. Con: Questions of such complexity and affecting third-parties \(non-catalan Spaniards\) should not be subject to a simplistic yes or no question, especially if there is no consensus.
1.1.1. Con: A referendum with no clarification of independence would be implemented would only bring further division and polarization to the Catalan population
1.1.2. Pro: The same right should apply to regions within Catalonia, allowing them to stay in Spain, to stay in Catalonia, or to form a 3rd independent state.
1.2. Pro: Becoming independent will allow Catalonia to better preserve its culture, traditions and language, against an increasing Castilianisation of the region.
1.2.1. Con: Within the last 40 years democracy, Catalonia has been a part of Spain together with many other regions which have been perfectly able to promote their local culture
1.3. Con: Both Spain and Catalonia would experience a bilateral weakening of power in the context of an increasingly globalised world, losing leverage against bigger countries.
1.3.1. Pro: The process of independence will generate uncertainty, which will lead to a negative economic outcome.
1.4. Pro: We can not pretend to be in support of democracy and fight against  people's democratic wish for independence.
1.4.1. Con: The indivisibility of Spain was stated democratically in the Constitution. If the majority of Spain wanted to separate Catalonia, there would be no problem, as the democratically elected parties would change the Constitution. The catalan independentist people are a small part of Spain, so even if the wish for independence is democratic, it is wanted by a minority \(in Spain\).
1.4.2. Con: Self determination is not a fundamental right and Spain is a democracy and a [good quality](https://www.eiu.com/topic/democracy-index) one.
1.4.3. Con: Supporting independence also means supporting bypassing the wish of a large part of the Catalan population who do not want Catalonia to secede.
1.4.3.1. Con: It is possible to support a referendum about Catalan independence without wishing Catalonia to be independent.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Surveys suggest that between 70% to 80% of the population of Catalonia want to decide on independence on a referendum
1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: [Surveys](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fcadenaser.com%2Fser%2F2017%2F09%2F10%2Fpolitica%2F1505067486_613847.html&edit-text=&act=url) suggest 60% of the population of Spain oppose allowing a referendum on the subject of Catalonia incependence unless it is held in the entire country.
1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Con: While 63,5% of Spaniards do not want a referendum in Catalonia, and only 24,1% do, in Catalonia [71% of Catalans](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fcadenaser.com%2Fser%2F2017%2F09%2F10%2Fpolitica%2F1505067486_613847.html&edit-text=&act=url) do want a referendum about their territory status and only a 20,4% do not.
1.4.3.1.1.1.2. Con: According to polls, there is a slight rise in the number of Spaniards that agree with a referendum to solve the political crisis. The number has reached [46,9%](https://www.elnacional.cat/en/politics/poll-rising-spaniards-referendum_261015_102.html), 7,2% more than the last time the question was surveyed.
1.4.3.1.1.2. Pro: Polls suggest that [85% of Catalans](http://www.catalannews.com/politics/item/85-of-catalans-in-favour-of-calling-a-referendum-according-to-latest-poll) would like to vote on an independence referendum,
1.4.3.2. Con: Supporting dependence also means supporting bypassing the wish of a large part of the Catalan population who do want Catalonia to secede.
1.4.4. Con: A wish for independence is democratic while its derived actions are applied under the Constitutional laws of the country; when these actions exceeds the law, supporting democracy is, in fact, to prosecute these illegal actions.
1.4.5. Pro: Self determination should be granted to any minority \(Catalans toward Spaniards\).
1.4.6. Pro: [Self determination](https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/1888/1/gupea_2077_1888_1.pdf) rights were conceived as a solution for colonies. Spain is treating the Catalan Parliament as one.
1.5. Pro: The self determination right is a basic human right that should be respected above any constitution
1.5.1. Con: Following this assumption, Spanish citizens should have the same right than Catalonian ones of self-determination about one of his territories. In other words, the decision about independence should be taken by all the citizens together. Especially when borders are a relative concept. E.g.New communities were created in Spain 40 years ago.
1.5.2. Con: The vast majority of present democratic nations keep the right to national integrity.
1.5.2.1. Pro: One of the few exceptions, Canada, recently stated that, if Quebec has right to decide on independence, also smaller regions in Quebec will \(Law of Clarity\). This point has never been clarified by independentists in Catalonia.
1.5.3. Pro: Catalonia's claim for the right to self-determination keeps getting stronger due to the undemocratic response of the Spanish state to Catalan requests. When a state refuses to work towards a political solution, uses violence on citizens who are asking for independence, imprisons leaders whose political views it does not like and creates obstacles for a regional government because it doesn't like election results, these actions justify a right to secede on democratic grounds.
1.5.3.1. Con: Not everyone that wants to break away from Spain.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: However, the best way to know where citizens stand is to consult them.
1.5.3.2. Con: Self-determination right must be the result of a common will.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: The 1-O referendum was illegal and disrespectful to half of Catalans who voted against pro-independence political parties in the last elections. Political leaders knew that they were acting against laws and even more, they incited citizens to do it too, resulting in leaders in prison and some citizens involved in violent acts.
1.5.4. Pro: All people groups have a right to self determination enshrined in [UN law](http://www.humanlaw.org/determination.html).
1.5.4.1. Con: This is only attached to solve colonies issues to be decolonized but this is not the Catalonia region case, which has been never colonized by Spain in any way.
1.5.5. Con: The self determination right was conceived as a solution for the many colonies that were seeking independence from their metropolis at the time. Catalonia is not a colony, so self determination doesn't apply to it.
1.5.5.1. Con: As the [United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_1514) states, the resolution was initiated to solve the colonization of various contries from imperialism. However, it also states "Convinced that all peoples have an inalienable right to complete freedom, the exercise of their sovereignty and the integrity of their national territory", proving that is not only applicable to colonies but to all people, in general.
1.5.6. Con: It's not a basic human right as it doesn't show up among the 30 articles of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights.](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)
1.5.6.1. Con: It was added in 1950 by the same UN [United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_1514)
1.5.6.1.1. Con: The title of this resolution states that it is specific for colonies:  "Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples". Catalonia is not and has never been a colony of Spain.
1.6. Pro: There is a majority of independentist parties on the Catalan parliament that defend a referendum.
1.6.1. Con: There were actually more [votes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/dec/21/catalonia-voters-results-regional-election-spain-live) for parties against independence than for, but in the parliament, parties for independece got more seats.
1.6.1.1. Con: That is not accurate. PP, PSC and C's \(parties against independence that support article 155\) achieved [1,902,061](http://gencat.cat/economia/resultats-parlament2017/09AU/DAU09999CM.htm?lang=ca) votes while JxCAT, ERC and CUP \(parties pro independence and against 155\) achieved [2,079,340](http://gencat.cat/economia/resultats-parlament2017/09AU/DAU09999CM.htm?lang=ca). CatComú, that are against article 155 and in favor of a referendum, achieved [326,360](http://gencat.cat/economia/resultats-parlament2017/09AU/DAU09999CM.htm?lang=ca) votes and some of their voters are pro [independece](http://cadenaser.com/ser/2017/12/04/politica/1512376596_823523.html) and some are not.
1.6.2. Con: All regular elections in the last 36 years in Catalonia have resulted in a popular vote minority for parties defending independence.
1.6.3. Con: The number of seats held by pro-referendum parties, or better yet their number of votes, would be a better indicator of a nation's opinion than the mere existence of political parties.
1.6.4. Pro: The majority of pro-independence votes would be clear and wider if a real referendum was presented, a referendum with a "yes" or "no" to became a new and independet state.
1.7. Pro: The application of the article 155 and the use of force by the Spanish government has not solved the issue. After jailing several government members and imposing snap elections the independence parties still won the majority. Only an agreed referendum will solve the political issue.
1.7.1. Pro: Violence will probably only result in more violence.
1.7.2. Con: Just holding a referendum would deprive 40 million of spaniards of their right of deciding whether their country can be split or not. How would that solve the issue for them?
1.7.3. Con: This does not answer the main question. The application of the article 155 can be considered a good or bad solution to some actions taken by politians, but it is independent from the right to decide on independence with a binding referendum.
1.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.
1.9. Pro: Such fundamental differences should be asked directly to the population with campaigns supporting both options
1.9.1. Con: Not everything can be voted on. Even Switzerland has referendum bans. There is a broad consensus that you can not vote on taxes, sovereignty or human rights. [Are referendums real democracy?](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/world/americas/colombia-brexit-referendum-farc-cameron-santos.html)
1.9.2. Pro: A referendum is decisive and it often puts to rest an issue for generations.
1.9.2.1. Pro: During the Scottish referendum, the nationalist promised everything and anything, including that the referendum was a once in a lifetime vote. The UK government is only now within its right to refuse another referendum. The Spanish government should show courage and trust in the people.
1.9.3. Con: That right can be amended in the Constitution. It does not exist solely because nobody has managed to build the majority required in Parliament for such a constitutional reform.
1.9.4. Con: The question is which population should be asked about it. Just the Catalans, or all Spaniards.
1.9.4.1. Con: Rights that protect autonomy are naturally not touched by the will of others. If the opposite would be the case, all EU members would have been asked, whether or not they wanted the Brexit.
1.9.4.1.1. Con: A political an economic union of sovereign countries, as it is the case with the UK and EU in the recent Brexit, is not comparable to a region within a sovereign country.
1.9.4.2. Con: The [1995 referendum in Quebec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_referendum,_1995), asked voters in that Canadian French-speaking province if Quebec should proclaim national sovereignty and become an independent country or not. The plebiscite did not ask the whole country, only those involved.
1.9.4.3. Con: The [referendum on Scottish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014) independence from the United Kingdom in 2014 only asked those living in Scotland to vote, not the whole nation.
1.9.5. Con: Unlike Scotland, in Catalonia the conditions of equality are not given in a referendum established in international agreements. In this case it is the Government of Catalonia itself that promotes public demonstrations and controls the media, preventing plurality and impartiality for a proper referendum.   [Lies about independence in Catalonia](https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/11/06/inenglish/1509969254_414927.html)
1.10. Con: The Spanish constitution does not allow a referendum that would break Spain
1.10.1. Pro: The Generalitat of Catalonia itself has prevented illegal voting when it had no interest in it. The law remains the same. For there to be a mandatory reference, the Generalitat must act first within the legacy and democracy. [The Generalitat prohibits the referendum and withdraws the ballot boxes of the CUP](http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2017/09/30/59909843268e3e2c218b45bd.html)
1.10.1.1. Con: This is not a valid argument against self determination but against the current government of the Generalitat.
1.10.2. Con: If laws would never change, women could not vote or slavery would still exist. Laws need to change and adapt with society.
1.10.3. Con: A core part of this debate is to determine the fairness \(or lack thereof\) of the Spanish constitution.
1.10.3.1. Con: The Spanish constitution is more lenient towards regionalisms than other European constitutions.
1.10.3.2. Con: This can not be part of the debate as no Constitution, on any country, can accept -and, in fact, accepts- unilateral secession decision for any of its regions at any moment. In fact, any country with this kind of article in its Constitution would be at continuous risk of being undone/dismantled at any time by  unilateral secession decisions by one or more of its regions.
1.10.4. Con: The Spanish constitution doesn't prohibit a referendum on independence for part of Spain. However, if held it could not initially be binding as the constitution does declare the indisoluble unity of Spain. So, the government can call a consultative vote to find out citizens' views, either just in Catalonia or in all of Spain. If a majority of Catalans want to be independent, a constitutional amendment could then be advocated to Spaniards as the best political solution to a difficult situation.
1.10.4.1. Pro: Although a binding referendum is not possible, the Spanish Constitution allows the possibility of a non-binding referendum \([Article 92](http://idpbarcelona.net/docs/blog/legality_referendum.pdf)\). Therefore, with political will and some modifications to the organic law that develops the article, the referendum could be made within the legal framework.
1.10.4.1.1. Con: Political will has so far been non-existent. Consecutive Spanish governments have been reluctant to modify the legal framework for a Catalan referendum. The Catalan people have no assurances or even a remote opportunity for dialogue.
1.10.4.2. Pro: The Spanish Constitution does have a mechanism to suppress or modify the article that asserts that Spain is an indissoluble unity. However, this ‘[aggravated process](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fes.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FReforma_de_la_Constituci%25C3%25B3n_espa%25C3%25B1ola%23Procedimiento_agravado&edit-text=)’ of reform is very complex and has never been used.
1.10.4.2.1. Pro: First, the ‘[aggravated process](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fes.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FReforma_de_la_Constituci%25C3%25B3n_espa%25C3%25B1ola%23Procedimiento_agravado&edit-text=)’ involves  2/3 of both chambers agreeing to start a Constitutional reform, the dissolution of the parliament and a call for general elections. Then the new elected MPs have to ratify the decision by a majority in Congress and absolute majority in the Senate and study the Constitution and the proposed change. The change has to be approved by 2/3 of both chambers and then it has to be ratified in a referendum.
1.10.5. Con: Most independent countries in the world, gained their independece through "illegal" methods, because otherwise there didn't exist any other way
1.10.5.1. Con: Though it is true that 'illegal' methods are a possible way to independence, it inevitably leads to a force-based outcome, where 'force-based' can mean trials, war, etc. depending on the specific case. Quality of life of citizens can be in danger if such is the case.
1.10.6. Pro: More importantly, the Spanish Constitution declares that the Spanish people \(not a part thereof\) is sovereign. Territorial integrity is subject to the sovereignty of the entire Spanish people.
1.10.7. Con: Self-determination right is the guaranty of democracy. If it would not exist, a majority could deliberately vote in favor of unfair policies affecting minorities. Then, the only way out for these minorities would be having the right of self-determination to be independent. This unfair policies can exist on different degrees, as in the Catalonia case in the economic field. That's why self-determination should be a non-negotiable right above any Constitution.
1.10.7.1. Con: Most nations do not have self-determination of their regions as part of their constitution as it would lead to the split of subsequent states ad eternum. Similarly a newly formed Catalonia would uphold its own indivisibility.
1.10.7.2. Con: In democracy, when a majority votes against the wish of a minority, that minority can make use of their Civil Liberties \([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties) for a summary\), which must be guaranteed always. Self-determination of minorities does no guarantee democracy, this relation cannot be found in the definition of democracy or self-determination.
1.11. Con: All spaniards should have the right to decide on this matter because sovereignty resides on all of Spain
1.11.1. Pro: All Spaniards will be affected by a secession of Catalonia.
1.11.1.1. Con: Affectation is not a criteria to allow or deny vote. All citizens in Europe could make the same claim.
1.11.1.2. Con: Most referendums on independence carried out to date only allowed voting to the people in the region in question.
1.11.2. Con: The right of people to self determination states "the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference." To have "another" nation weigh in on a people's sovereignty would constitute interference.
1.11.2.1. Con: Self-determination is not an actual right according to international law except in very specific cases, on the other hand territorial integrity is a widely-recognized right.
1.11.2.1.1. Con: Not all rights are covered by current legislation.
1.11.2.1.2. Con: It is actually a right, added by the UN in 1960: "All peoples have the right to self-determination; by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development." \([United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_1514)\).
1.11.3. Con: While this is a fair argument, no party in Spain is willing to undertake a nation-wide referendum.
1.11.3.1. Pro: It is unfortunate that no political party in Catalonia or outside had thought it important to hold a nationwide referendum. I would be fair to ask not only those that might want to become independent but also those that may not want to see their country´s territorial integrity at risk.
1.11.4. Con: Self-determination right is the guaranty of democracy. If it would not exist, a majority could deliberately vote in favor of unfair policies affecting minorities. Then, the only way out for these minorities would be having the right of self-determination to be independent. This unfair policies can exist on different degrees, as in the Catalonia case in the economic field. That's why self-determination should be a non-negotiable right above any Constitution.
1.11.4.1. Con: Self-determination on independence cannot serve to protect all minorities, only those that are based in a specific place. In Catalonia, the pro-independence and pro-unity communities live in the same places. Self-determination would not protect the minority group and could instead force the minority to move away, like partition in India.
1.12. Con: A referendum on independence does not solve the problems of Catalonia.  [Regional referendum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV2RGs6jbPQ)
1.12.1. Pro: The referendum does not propose a solution, because if it is lost, it insists until the victory due to the exhaustion of public opinion.  [Scotland Second Referendum](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-39264468)
1.12.2. Pro: If Catalonia become independent, new referendums should also take part within several Catalonian regions which have showed refusing the separation
1.12.3. Pro: The Quebec example shows that a referendum does not end the debate, since the referendum is cyclically insisting, creating a negative effect.  [Montreal Effects](https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-10-06/does-barcelona-really-want-to-end-up-like-montreal)
1.12.4. Pro: There have been already many consultations about independence and a decision has not been made.
1.12.4.1. Pro: Catalonia has already voted on multiple occasions on its independence: municipal consultations in 2009 and 2010 and 2011, 2012 elections, multireferendum 2014, pre-independence elections 2014, Referendum independence 2014, plebiscite elections 2015, Referendum independence 2017, elections post referendum 2017, and none of them has reached a valid percentage.  [Catalonia independence referendums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_referendums,_2009%E2%80%9311)
1.13. Con: Catalonia was never an independent nation and therefore does not have the right of self determination
1.13.1. Con: The criteria to allow or deny the right of self determination of a nation cannot be based on their past success to create a state. Doing so incurs in a circular logic.
1.13.2. Con: All modern countries have emerged via 2 possible ways: merging of previous states \(e.g. Germany, Italy\) or secession \(without having been an independent country before\). So for example this argument supports that all American countries' independent secession were illegitimate, which I do not believe.
1.13.3. Con: Neither was Belgium until [the Belgian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Revolution).
