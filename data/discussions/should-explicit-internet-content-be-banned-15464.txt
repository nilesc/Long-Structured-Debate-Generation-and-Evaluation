Discussion Title: Should Explicit Internet Content Be Banned?

1. Explicit Internet Content Should Be Banned.
1.1. Pro: The effects of pornography are similar to that of drugs, so the government should regulate the internet to ban explicit content.
1.1.1. Con: Drugs are [considerably more dangerous](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/women-who-stray/201307/your-brain-porn-its-not-addictive) than porn.
1.2. Con: No, personal freedom must not be denied.
1.2.1. Con: All freedom has its limits.
1.2.2. Pro: Banning alcohol would prevent drunk driving and drunk violence.  We do not because[historically](http://prohibition.themobmuseum.org/the-history/the-rise-of-organized-crime/the-mob-during-prohibition/) banning things increases demand while decreasing legal oversight / incentives to stay within legal bounds.
1.2.3. Pro: It is the responsibility of the user to self-moderate and filter.
1.2.4. Pro: No, explicit content is constructive and serves as an outlet for desire.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Sex workers often use the internet to make appointments with clients in a more effective and safe manner.
1.2.4.2. Pro: It has been suggested some [books](https://electricliterature.com/24-most-controversial-books-of-all-time-70e484941082) are dangerous because it may inspire undesired behavior.  If a behavior is bad, the behavior \(violence / trafficking\) is what should be opposed, not the places it sneaks into \(books / art / porn created by consensual adults\)
1.2.4.3. Con: Not all explicit content is constructive- some explicit content consists of rape, sexual assault, and child pornography. Such content is inherently destructive.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: Pornography that genuinely depicts these things is already illegal, and thus not relevant to this discussion. Pornography that legally mimics these things is constructive \(on the balance\).
1.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: It gives a legal outlet to those who have such urges, which can only ever be good.
1.2.4.4. Pro: In general, the availability of pornography reduces the priority of sexuality in human relationships. This frees people to focus on factors that have more bearing on their well being. \(Porn-addicted persons do not fit this pattern, but they are the exception, not the rule.\)
1.3. Con: There is no point banning explicit content, as there are always ways to access banned content.
1.4. Pro: Gender relations would improve if explicit content were banned.
1.4.1. Pro: A huge quantity of explicit internet content is misogynistic; banning it would be a positive move.
1.4.1.1. Con: Banning materials we personally disagree with and find repugnant is a slippery [slope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_book-burning_incidents).  There are [many things](https://www.salon.com/2014/12/15/one_nation_under_galt_how_ayn_rands_toxic_philosophy_permanently_transformed_america_partner/) some may consider [harmful to society](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/heavy-metal-band-could-face-7427447) that are best addressed through education rather than bans.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: [Slippery slope is illogical reasoning.](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/slippery-slope)
1.4.2. Con: Alternatively, creators of explicit content should meet the demand from all genders for explicit content.
1.4.2.1. Con: Demand is definitely met. Although some demographics demand much less than others.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: This is strongly debatable. Female-orientated pornography is rare at best.
1.4.3. Con: Explicit content is not inherently misogynist.  It contains gay, lesbian, fem-Dom, and other dynamics.  Misogynistic trends \(in [all](https://archive.massappeal.com/misogyny-in-hip-hop/) [media](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/30/times-up-for-james-bond-is-007-too-brutish-for-the-me-too-era)\) is based on demand, which is a reflection \(not cause\) of [cultural desire](https://mic.com/articles/64527/does-watching-porn-make-you-sexist-the-answer-may-shock-you). As that's addressed all media [will](https://www.investopedia.com/university/economics/economics3.asp) begin to reflect it.
1.4.3.1. Pro: There are also sites that specifically promote and host non-misogynistic, "ethical" explicit content.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Explicit content does not rupture relations between genders because of misogyny alone, but does so in general through radical sexualization and objectification of the other relative to oneself.
1.4.4. Pro: It is surprising that women's rights and women empowerment groups across the globe don't have noticeable activism against explicit content. Women deserve much more respect in society. We are seeing a lot of progress in the corporate world and politics. Banning explicit content will certainly go a long way towards respect for women outside those two spheres.
1.4.4.1. Con: On the contrary, part of the movement for the empowerment of women includes empowering women- indeed, most all persons- to seize their sexuality and take full control of their right to sexual choice. That includes being able to choose to be involved in explicit content, particularly in making it more ethical and make it appealing to people of all genders and sexualities.
1.4.5. Con: Countless women have made careers out of adult entertainment. It would be doubtful that gender relations would improve if thousands of women were suddenly legislated out of work.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Some, if not many, feminists especially note this concerning adult content, and believe women should be able to as they wish with their sexuality and physicality, including use it to be self-sufficient.
1.5. Con: Prohibitions intended to protect people from themselves result in black markets that have various unabated negative consequences. Legal industries can receive common-sense oversight and regulatory pressures to reduce any negative consequences and promote positive consequences.
1.6. Con: It is not the government's place to regulate ethical affairs.
1.6.1. Pro: The internet must be a content neutral communication platform. This infrastructure layer is not the place to control content.
1.6.2. Pro: The US \(a nation\) has no right to control content on an international service like the Internet.
1.6.3. Pro: It is difficult to determine what is to be considered explicit, making it a possible subject for arbitrary regulation, which would be a form of tyranny.
1.6.4. Con: The very nature of law is the imposition and, indeed, regulation of ethics.
1.7. Con: The current laws banning some content are sufficient.
1.7.1. Con: Most bans can be circumnavigated if one tries hard enough.
1.8. Con: Tax revenue from pornographic sites are needed to fund important social programs.
1.8.1. Con: There are other ways to get this income; taxation of any industry adds money towards social programs. Higher taxes in other areas can make up the shortfall.
