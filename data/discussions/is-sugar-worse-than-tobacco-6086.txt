Discussion Title: Is sugar worse than tobacco?

1. Sugar is more detrimental to humanity than tobacco.
1.1. Con: The human body needs sugar to survive while it can avoid tobacco entirely.
1.1.1. Pro: No recognised medical authority recommends the complete elimination of sugars from diet but they do strongly recommend the elimination of tobacco.
1.1.2. Pro: The elimination of carbohydrates from diet is considered [medically dangerous and unhealthy.](https://web.archive.org/web/20060719023624/http://www.shapeup.org/about/arch_pr/122903.php)
1.1.3. Pro: Glucose is a sugar and is essential for the body to function. Carbohydrates are the best nutrient source for glucose hence why diabetics [treat hypos](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/teens/me-and-my-diabetes/getting-my-glucose-right/hypos/hypos---what-to-do) through intake of sugars.
1.1.3.1. Con: Glucose is essential to bodily function; however, the body produces it from almost every food consumed. The reason why carbohydrates are used to treat hypoglycemia is because there is a need to raise blood sugar quickly. In people without hypoglycemia, dietary sugar is not required
1.1.4. Con: There is natural sugar in fruit, meaning there is absolutely no need for refined sugar.
1.2. Con: Tobacco tastes worse than sugar.
1.2.1. Con: This makes sugar more addictive and more widespread in use. As such, its effects are felt by even more people, making it more dangerous than tobacco.
1.3. Con: Tobacco is more likely to lead on to harder drugs, whereas sugar is not.
1.3.1. Con: Sugar has been shown to be able to surpass cocaine in addictiveness.["Our findings clearly demonstrate that intense sweetness can surpass cocaine reward."](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1931610/)
1.4. Pro: Sugar damages your overall health and well-being
1.4.1. Pro: Sugar, particularly its fructose component, is a [chronic toxin.](http://time.com/4087775/sugar-is-definitely-toxic-a-new-study-says/)
1.4.2. Pro: Sugar damage your teeth.
1.4.2.1. Con: Smoking also damages your teeth.
1.4.3. Pro: Sugar causes systemic inflammation.
1.4.4. Con: Smoking tobacco causes cancer while no definite link between cancer and sugar exists in humans.
1.4.4.1. Con: People die of diseases associated with the over-consumption of sugar, such as heart disease and diabetes, too.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: A study found that sugary drinks alone are responsible for the death of [184,000 people](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11707396/Sugary-drinks-kill-184000-a-year-through-diabetes-heart-disease-and-cancer.html) a year.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: Sugar is the route cause of our [diabetes and obesity](http://time.com/3687808/this-is-the-number-1-driver-of-diabetes-and-obesity/) epidemics.
1.4.4.1.3. Con: The key is overconsumption.  People can die of diseases from the overconsumption of most nutrients including fat and protein.
1.5. Pro: Sugar is highly addictive.
1.5.1. Pro: According to the [APA's Diagnostic Statistical Manual](https://www.partners.org/Assets/Documents/Graduate-Medical-Education/SubstanceB.pdf), an addictive substance must satisfy these requirements: tolerance, withdrawal, bingeing, desire or attempts to cut down or quit, craving or seeking, interference with life, and use despite negative consequences. The first two characterize physiological dependence, and the last five characterize psychological dependence. Sugar meets all of these requirements.
1.5.2. Con: [Cambridge neuroscientists](http://www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/blog/2016/07/21/sugar-addictive-probably-not-say-cambridge-neuroscientists/) conducted a study that found while sugar may seem addictive instinctively, the scientific literature is lacking substantial evidence that this is true.
1.6. Pro: Sugar intake is more common than tobacco, meaning it is negatively affecting more people.
1.6.1. Pro: Tobacco is bound to [harsher regulation](http://ftp.iza.org/dp5290.pdf) which has been decreasing its consumption over the past decades.
1.6.2. Pro: Tobacco is perceived as a dirty and viciously harmful product, while sugar poison has a more innocent image.
1.6.2.1. Pro: The health effects of tobacco are explicitly stated on the packaging.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: The sugar content of any product is also displayed on the packaging.
1.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: Sugar is often hidden in processed foods, meaning people are not aware of their levels of consumption.
1.6.2.2. Pro: Languages and cultures use the word "sugar" \(and related\) to describe certain favorable and pleasing characteristics of appearance, personality and more
1.6.2.3. Con: Increasingly [academics](http://sugarscience.ucsf.edu/latest-sugarscience-research.html), [newspapers](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/books/review/case-against-sugar-gary-taubes.html) and people in the [public eye](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-06/the-jamie-oliver-diet-how-u-k-celebrity-chef-took-on-big-sugar)  are publicising the negative effects of sugar and calling for it to be regarded as a dangerous and harmful substance.
1.6.2.4. Pro: The sugar industry has [manipulated](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html) scientific studies about the effects of sugar to ensure people did not find out about the harm it creates. As such, people have a false image of sugar.
1.6.2.4.1. Pro: The [sugar industry](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html) paid scientists in the 1960s to downplay the link between sugar and heart disease, instead marketing that saturated fat was to be feared instead.
1.6.2.4.2. Pro: [Coca Cola](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/coca-cola-funds-scientists-who-shift-blame-for-obesity-away-from-bad-diets/) provided millions of dollars to researchers who tried to down-play the link between sugary drinks and obesity by shifting the attention to exercise, rather than consumption.
1.6.3. Pro: Children consume a lot of sugar, yet do not consume tobacco. As such, they are at a much larger risk of suffering from the negative effects of sugar, than tobacco.
1.6.4. Pro: Sugar is increasingly found in all types of food and derivatives.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Cutting out tobacco of your diet is way easier than eliminating sugar out of your diet. It is almost impossible.
