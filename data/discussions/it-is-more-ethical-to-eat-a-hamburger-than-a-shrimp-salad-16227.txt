Discussion Title: It is more ethical to eat a hamburger than a shrimp salad.

1. It is more ethical to eat a hamburger than a shrimp salad.
1.1. Con: All consumption of meat is equally unethical.
1.1.1. Con: Eating humans is certainly more unethical than eating any animal.
1.1.2. Con: Most cultures consider some meats "taboo" while have no problem with most others.
1.1.3. Pro: Fish have feelings too.
1.1.3.1. Con: Shrimp aren't fish.
1.2. Pro: Many shrimp must be killed to make a shrimp salad, but a single cow can provide enough meat to make numerous burgers.
1.2.1. Pro: Under utilitarianism, the number of deaths should be minimized.
1.2.1.1. Con: Utilitarianism cares not just for the amount of lives, but also the quality of those lives.
1.3. Con: All consumption of meat is equally ethical.
1.4. Pro: Nets don't discriminate, so shrimp farming can put other wild ocean animals in danger too.
1.5. Pro: At least 28% of the world’s freshwater shrimp species are [threatened with extinction](https://www.peta.org/living/food/top-10-reasons-eat-shrimp/).
1.6. Con: Cows are a higher level organism than shrimp, and thus no number of shrimp outweighs the life of a cow.
1.6.1. Con: All life has equal value, regardless of species.
1.6.1.1. Con: Species are vastly different from each other in how they perceive the word, and thus the value they gain from living.
1.6.2. Pro: Cows are mammals while shrimp are crustaceans. Thus cows are far more complex than shrimp.
1.6.2.1. Con: Complexity should not be a standard to deserve good-treatment.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: Yes, it must be. Otherwise, people might start fighting for the rights of bacteria.
1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: There is a fundamental difference between multicellular life and single celled life. Otherwise it individual cell in a multicellular organism must be counted as a separate organism. It's only all multicellular organism that have equal value.
1.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con: You are drawing the line somewhere. There's not "objectively correct" way to put that line.
1.6.2.2. Con: All life is equally evolved, mammal or crustacean and shrimp are remarkably complex albeit in different ways.
1.6.2.3. Con: The level of complexity of the thing being consumed is irrelevant when we talk about eating muscle compared to eating an organ.
1.7. Con: The farming practices for raising cows is far more damaging to the environment than fishing shrimp.
1.7.1. Con: Shrimp farming has been linked to [human slavery.](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/14/shrimp-sold-by-global-supermarkets-is-peeled-by-slave-labourers-in-thailand)
1.7.1.1. Con: However, this is not linked with the environment.
1.7.2. Pro: Cows release on overage between 70 and 120 kg of Methane per year, which is equivalent to about [2300kg CO2/year](https://timeforchange.org/are-cows-cause-of-global-warming-meat-methane-CO2).
1.7.2.1. Con: If we wouldn't eat them, there would be many more of them, so they would pollute even more.
