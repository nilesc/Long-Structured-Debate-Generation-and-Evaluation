Discussion Title: Is Islam a threat to Western civilization?

1. Islam is a threat to Western civilization.
1.1. Con: Islamic teachings [match the main values of Western Civilization](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-truth-about-whether-islamic-values-are-compatible-with-western-values-a7141381.html).
1.1.1. Pro: Islam [had facilitated the rise of Western Civilization](http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/how-islamic-learning-transformed) a few centuries ago.
1.2. Pro: Much depends on the definitions of Islam and threat. Islam in its most rigid form is a threat to any society, culture or individual that does not accept it and that will not adhere to the strict interpretation of the guiding principles.
1.2.1. Pro: As far as being a threat to Western civilization, it is most assuredly a threat or perhaps better said a potential threat depending on who and how it is interpreted. That can be seen clearly by the interpretation of Islam in the eyes of ISIS, Taliban and others.
1.3. Con: Islam is quite similar in doctrine to other Abrahamic religions like Christianity and Judaism. If they do not represent threats to Western civilization then Islam does not either.
1.3.1. Con: [Most](http://www.npdata.be/BuG/255-Fundamentalisme/Article-Koopman.pdf) Christian and Judaic societies have abandoned the scriptures that go against modern western principles. The percentage of muslims that hold to these anti-western ideas is a lot larger than that of Christians.
1.3.2. Con: The original question does not mention other religions and does not consider the threat they cause or do not cause. Therefore, the point is irrelevant.
1.3.3. Con: Islam shares a history with Judaism and Christianity but is vastly different in doctrinal and theological views.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Most central to the Christian faith is the death and resurrection of Jesus. In Islam, believing so is an unforgivable sin.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Jesus, as the central figure of Christianity, preached love and forgiveness, never called for violence and was crucified under Roman rule. Muhammed, as the central figure of Islam, preached violence and the superiority of his people over others, was a warlord, and started an empire which spread by the sword.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Many of the more peaceful verses in the Qu'ran are [abrogated](https://www.meforum.org/articles/2007/peace-or-jihad-abrogation-in-islam) by the more violent ones.
1.3.4. Con: Islam is inherently supremacist, claiming a higher social status for Muslims than for non-muslims \('dhimmi'\). A high-proportion Muslim society will not treat non-Muslims equally and will enforce Islamic norms on that society, to the detriment of women, gays, Jews and non-Muslims generally.
1.4. Con: It is not Islam itself but the way in which it is interpreted and practiced by individuals. Often cultures have a strong impact on behavior and attitudes.
1.4.1. Pro: Islamic terrorism and extremism may be a threat to Western Civilization, but Islam and normal Muslims are not.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Many immigrant Muslims assimilate into the cultures of their host countries and act like responsible citizens.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Extremist factions that belong to other religions can also threaten Western Civilization like Muslim extremists.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: They can, but they haven't done so in a long time.
1.4.1.2.2. Con: Suggesting the existence of other extremists in no way supports the claim that Islam is not a threat to Western Civilisation.
1.4.1.3. Con: One is a Muslim if and only if one follows or, at the very least, agrees with the Quran, which includes explicitly stated principles that oppose the so-called western values of democracy.
1.4.1.4. Con: Islamic terrorists are at least partially inspired by Islamic scripture.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: It is stated in [Surah 9 Verse 29](https://quran.com/9/29) of the Quran that Muslims should: "Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture - \[fight\] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled."    This applies to all those who don't believe in a monotheistic deity, those that do pay the "Jizyah" instead.
1.4.1.4.2. Con: Many ancient texts can be misinterpreted because the original meaning is either lost in translation or forgotten.
1.4.1.4.2.1. Con: The Quran and Hadith are still supposed to be read in Arabic, and many muslims do just that. Reading translations is usually seen as less than ideal.
1.4.1.4.3. Pro: There are two guaranteed means to enter Paradise \(Heaven\) in Islam. The first is through lifelong piety, the second is through martydom \(jihad\) as a holy warrior \(Mujahid\) to gain guaranteed entry to Jannah \(Paradise\). Sahih Bukhari \(52:46\) - "Allah guarantees that He will admit the Mujahid in His Cause into Paradise if he is killed, otherwise He will return him to his home safely with rewards and war booty."
1.4.1.5. Con: Islam in not compatible with human rights as they are accepted in modern democratic and secular countries.
1.4.1.5.1. Pro: Islamic scripture condones slavery. Muhammed is to this day seen as a shining example, while he [practiced](http://Bukhari 34.351) and approved of the capture and [trade of slaves](http://Bukhari \(41.598\)) in war, including [non-combatants.](http://Muslim 19.4345) He even [condoned](http://Bukhari 62.137) the sexual \(mis\)use of slaves.
1.4.1.5.2. Pro: Women are not considered as equals in Islamic scripture.

[More likely to go to hell.](https://muflihun.com/bukhari/54/464)
[A woman's testimony in court counts as only half of a man's testimony, because they are considered to be less intelligent.](https://muflihun.com/bukhari/6/301)
[A woman share of an inheritance is half of what a man's share would be.](https://quran.com/4/11)
1.4.1.5.3. Pro: Non-muslims are not to be treated as equals according to Islamic scripture. Conquered non-Muslims are supposed to pay extra taxes, such as the [Jizya](http://Quran \(9:29\)) tax.
1.4.1.6. Con: When/if muslims become large enough, they can use democracy against itself, and vote for [laws](https://christenenvoorisrael.nl/isreality/nieuws/video-nieuwe-politieke-partij-joden-erger-dan-duivel) that go against Western civilization.
1.4.1.6.1. Pro: The rapid influx of a religion based on strongly conservative views would not have the time to integrate itself within the more liberal society. Rather, it may push the liberal society away by enforcing its own presence. Eventually, the sheer number of people disinterested in integration may lead to a clash between the two cultures.["Around half \(49%\) of Muslims say they would like full integration with non-Muslims in all aspects of life \(2016\)."](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/publication/documents/2018-03/a-review-of-survey-research-on-muslims-in-great-britain-ipsos-mori_0.pdf) Suggesting half are disinterested in integration.
1.4.1.6.1.1. Con: The other 51% may not want to integrate, but their is little evidence to suggest that they all want the same type of system of governance or the same kinds of policies as each other.
1.4.1.6.1.1.1. Con: According to [this study](http://www.npdata.be/BuG/255-Fundamentalisme/Article-Koopman.pdf), similar percentages of muslims in western Europe agree on multiple statements that go against basic western principles. These include the idea that religious laws should be above state laws and the idea that there is only one binding interpretation of religious scripture.
1.4.1.7. Con: A [disproportionate percentage](https://www.wzb.eu/system/files/docs/sv/iuk/ruud_koopmans_religious_fundamentalism_and_out-group_hostility_among_muslims_and_christian.pdf) of 'normal' Muslims, even in western countries, hold views that are incompatible with western values \(even when compared to Christians\).
1.5. Pro: The fundamental principles of Islam as found in the Quran, Hadith and other sound sources oppose Western principles.
1.5.1. Pro: There are various concepts in Quran such as Jihad which can be interpreted in a manner that can lead to destruction.
1.5.2. Con: The fundamental beliefs of all the Abrahamic religions oppose modern Western principles to some degree. Most of the Old Testament is objectionable to modern sensibilities, particularly passages in Deuteronomy.
1.5.2.1. Con: The Quran can't be altered or edited or reinterpreted because it is the literal word of god, handed down to Muhammad by Gabriel.The Bible and Torah can and have been edited and reinterpreted. This makes the Quran a lot more rigid in adapting to modern values.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: If corruption can occur with one then it could occur to all.
1.5.2.1.2. Pro: The Quran is considered to be literally written by God, unlike the Bible, which is merely inspired by God. Consequently any attempt to modify or relativize passages in the Quran is impermissible as no one has the authority to challenge the words of God.
1.5.2.1.3. Pro: [Attempts](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/05/france-delete-verses-quran/559550/) to alter scripture to better fit modern values have been met with outrage and even violence, even in western countries.
1.5.2.1.4. Pro: The [majority of muslims](http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-executive-summary/) worldwide believe that their scripture can only be interpreted in one way.
1.5.2.2. Con: Practically all christian churches are following the New testament. Almost none christian churches are claiming that the old testament should be followed literally. The name "Old Testament" reflects Christianity's understanding of itself as the fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecy replaced by "New Testament"
1.5.2.3. Con: Pointing out that other books oppose modern Western principles is not a claim against the proposition that the Qu'ran does likewise.
1.5.3. Pro: Creationism as well as homophobia are quite common beliefs, even in second generation Muslim immigrants and these are supported by a scripture which is strictly adhered to as opposed to other Abraham religions, particularly Christianity, which have distanced themselves from objectionable scripture.
1.5.4. Pro: Freedom of religion is a fundamental Western principle. In Islam, it's not. In for example the Qur'an, [Surah 5:33](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=5&verse=33), opposers of Islam are to be killed or crucified.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Similar things are [written](https://muflihun.com/bukhari/59/369) about apostates, multiple times.
1.5.5. Pro: Equality of men and women is a fundamental Western principle. In Islam, it's not. In for example the Qur'an, [Surah 2:282](https://quran.com/2/282), it says that the testimony of women is valued half of that of men.
1.5.6. Pro: There is no single country with majority of muslims that would not violate Human rights by some law.
1.6. Pro: Evidence suggests that a majority of Muslims hold views that violate principles of liberty and freedom, and can be quite extremist.
1.6.1. Pro: The influence of religion on everyday life is much greater in Islamic societies than it is in western societies. This is true for both societies on a large scale \(like countries\), and on a small scale \(like families\).
1.6.1.1. Pro: The proportion of laws based on religious laws \(Sharia/Fiqh\) is much greater in Islamic countries than most other countries.
1.6.1.2. Con: The influence of religion is strong in most developing countries due to their colonial backgrounds. Policies of divide and rule solidified these identities and so did the post-colonial politics of these countries once they achieved independence.
1.6.2. Pro: Countries which have a majority of Muslims are seeing the non-Muslim population decrease due to [persecution and intolerance](http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2016/12/12/4591292.htm).
1.6.3. Pro: A [majority of Muslims](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/11/europe/britain-muslims-survey/index.html) living in Western societies like the UK believe homosexuality should be banned.
1.6.4. Pro: A majority of Muslims living in Muslim majority countries want [Sharia](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/09/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/) to be the official law.
1.6.5. Pro: Attacks like the Charlie Hebdo shooting demonstrate the violent response to criticism or ridicule of Islam.
1.6.6. Con: The [number of Jihadhists](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/26/opinion/bergen-schneider-how-many-jihadists/) compared to the [number of Muslims](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/31/worlds-muslim-population-more-widespread-than-you-might-think/) is way under the numbers usually stated.
1.6.6.1. Con: The 'practicing' jihadists have substantial [support networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstad_Network) that manage to stay under the radar most of the time. For example, Abedeslam was able to hide in [Molenbeek](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/16/radicalisation-molenbeek-terrorist-brussels-belgian) \(a part of [Brussels](https://www.1limburg.nl/radicale-bestuurders-moskee-geleen-oefenden-met-nepwapens) known for its high number of Muslims\) for months because he had such a support network.
1.6.7. Con: Christianity and Hebraism also hold views that violate principles of liberty and freedom \(ex. same sex marriage\), but they're accepted.
1.6.7.1. Con: This is a [Tu quoque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque) fallacy. Just because this is the case for Christianity and Judaism does not necessarily make it the case for Islam.
1.6.7.2. Con: The percentage of christians that stick to these beliefs is [a lot smaller](http://www.npdata.be/BuG/255-Fundamentalisme/ruud_koopmans_religious_fundamentalism_and_out-group_hostility_among_muslims_and_christian.pdf) than the percentage of Muslims.
1.7. Pro: Evidence suggests that Muslims as a demographic group in particular can be burdensome on or in the worst case, threaten the state.
1.7.1. Pro: [Muslim refugees](http://theconversation.com/factcheck-qanda-do-refugees-cost-australia-100m-a-year-in-welfare-with-an-unemployment-rate-of-97-54395) mostly remain on long term welfare after arriving in Western countries.
1.7.2. Pro: [Muslims](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lammy-review-muslim-prisoners_uk_59afcaa0e4b0b5e531022f26) are over-represented in criminal activities and Western prisons.
1.7.2.1. Con: Many of these prisoners [convert to Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_to_Islam_in_prisons) in jail.
1.7.2.2. Con: Marginalized communities are generally over-represented in criminal activities. This applies equally to black people in America; that is not to say that black people are threats to America. If that is so, then Muslims are not threats to Western Civilization either.
1.7.2.2.1. Con: Black people do not have a unifying ideology with possibly dangerous concepts like Jihad, where as Muslims do. Black people are clearly a marginalized group with a long standing history of oppression throughout history whereas Islam is a cultural force that has a long history of violence.
1.7.3. Pro: The Muslim population is [growing rapidly](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/11/29/europes-growing-muslim-population/) throughout Europe.
1.7.3.1. Pro: [Erdogan calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/17/erdogan-calls-turkish-families-have-five-children-bulwark-against/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) on Turkish families in Europe to have five children to protect against 'injustices'. This proves that Islamic immigration to Europe is a Trojan horse.
1.7.3.2. Con: This does not necessarily indicate a threat unless it is granted that Muslims generally pose one.
1.7.4. Pro: [Islamic terrorism](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/2017-eu-terrorism-report-142-failed-foiled-and-completed-attacks-1002-arrests-and-142-victims-died) represents the vast majority of terrorism related activities in Europe and the world in general.
1.7.5. Con: Terrorism, whilst awful, directly affects a very small number of people - compared to, say, traffic accidents - so it isn't an important factor in evaluating the contribution of muslims to a country.
1.7.5.1. Con: This argument is deeply flawed. Drivers, as opposed to terrorists, do not actively try to inflict pain and death to other people.
1.7.5.2. Con: The argument was not limited to terrorism. Muslims continue to be burdensome in other ways.
1.7.6. Pro: Muslims have been shown to be less productive than non-Muslims living in Western societies. [For example](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-04/fact-check-muslim-workforce/9800656) in Australia, 43% of working age Muslims are not part of the labor force, compared to 24% for the general population.
1.7.6.1. Pro: [Similar statistics](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/publication/2016/47/annual-report-on-integration-2016) can be found about the Netherlands.
