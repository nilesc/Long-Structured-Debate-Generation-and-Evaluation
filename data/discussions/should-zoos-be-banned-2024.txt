Discussion Title: Should Zoos Be Banned?

1. Zoos should be forbidden.
1.1. Pro: The benefits that zoos provide can be gained through more ethical methods.
1.1.1. Pro: The increased sophistication of animal documentaries could help them replace zoos in terms of education and enjoyment.
1.1.1.1. Pro: In many ways, documentaries provide a superior experience to zoos, because viewers can see how animals behave and interact in a more authentic environment.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Viewers can access a far greater range of species in documentaries than they can in zoos.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Watching animals on a screen cannot compare to seeing, and possibly even petting them in real life.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: Zoos provide opportunities to physically study the anatomy and ailments of large/dangerous animals for those studying in those fields. These opportunities could not be replicated by documentaries.
1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Educational benefits and research can be equally achieved by [Eco Parks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/buenos-aires-zoo-close-animals-captivity-argentina).
1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Animals can be moved to reserves and to places with more space, with more people that understand the true needs of every species.
1.1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Sanctuaries are great platforms to educate people about animals, and why keeping them confined often fails.  Zoos, not so much.  No elephant, gorilla, killer whale etc. in captivity has the quality of life that they deserve.
1.1.1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Sanctuaries are not always open to the public, and even then can only be open to [public who reserve a private tour](http://www.sanctuaryfederation.org/gfas/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/How-GFAS-Distinguishes-between-Legitimate-and-Pseudo.pdf).
1.1.1.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: Researchers in the field of elephant welfare have discovered that their social, psychological and physical needs are so complex that there is no ethical way to keep [elephants](http://voices.nationalgeographic.org/2013/05/03/no-ethical-way-to-keep-elephants-in-captivity/) in captivity.
1.1.1.1.3.1.3. Con: Eco-parks do not guarantee that the visitor sees any animals, as they may not be present.
1.1.1.1.3.1.3.1. Con: Zoos equally do not guarantee that all animals are seen as some might be difficult to see or sleeping.
1.1.1.1.3.1.4. Con: National parks are notoriously [prone to political exploitation](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/03/donald-trump-slash-size-national-parks-utah-allow-drilling/) by companies that wish to access the natural resources there.
1.1.1.1.3.1.5. Con: Eco-parks are far less accessible than zoos are.
1.1.1.1.3.1.6. Con: Eco parks are still fundamentally equivalent to zoos in that they establish unnatural constraints on animal behaviour
1.1.1.1.3.1.7. Pro: In an Eco-Park, no animals would be kept in a permanent state of captivity and a specialized clinic would be set up to recover and release wild animals from illegal trafficking.
1.1.1.1.3.1.7.1. Con: Many animals cannot be released and need to be in a state of captivity for care. Even sanctuaries are a type of captivity.
1.1.1.1.3.1.7.1.1. Pro: Many animals rescued for the purpose of rehabilitation remain in [permanent captivity](http://www.ifaw.org/united-states/our-work/animal-rescue/wildlife-rehabilitation-and-release) because of severe injury or being in captivity for too long. For those animals, eco-parks are no different than zoos.
1.1.1.1.3.1.8. Pro: In Eco parks, children can learn about biodiversity and how to protect it.
1.1.1.1.3.1.8.1. Pro: Eco parks are more principally consistent than educational zoos, which is important when educating children. Children might not recognize the lessons of the importance in caring for animals at zoos, because the forced captivity contradicts it.
1.1.1.1.3.1.8.1.1. Pro: Learning about animals in zoos is a warped education given that the animals are not actually living in their natural environments.
1.1.1.1.3.1.8.1.1.1. Pro: Zoos have created a [distorted](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/how-zoos-are-distorting-our-view-of-the-natural-world/) view of animal behavior and habits. Thus, researching them in an environment that encourages behaviors, dietary habits, and breeding that are in response to their distorted surroundings, will not result in accurate findings.
1.1.1.1.3.1.8.1.1.2. Pro: If zoos are teaching children anything, it's that imprisoning animals for our own entertainment is acceptable.
1.1.1.1.3.1.8.1.1.2.1. Con: Without, zoos it would be impossible teach children to love and potentially care for the other inhabitants of this planet. Those children may become the decision makers that determine if a species lives or dies.
1.1.1.1.3.1.8.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Pets can be easily used for this purpose.
1.1.1.1.3.1.8.1.1.3. Pro: Animals in captivity may behave in more lethargic ways due to lack of proper exercise and mental stimulation. This gives children an unrealistic view of what these animals are like in the wild.
1.1.1.1.3.1.8.1.1.4. Con: Even though zoo animals do not live in their natural environment, a lot can still be learned about the animals, if one takes into account these limitations.
1.1.1.1.3.1.8.1.1.4.1. Con: Only a professional who tracks these animals for a long time can learn something from animals in captivity. The brief amount of time that a layperson spends observing an animal in captivity usually does not provide any additional information that cannot be obtained from watching wild-life documentaries.
1.1.1.1.3.1.8.1.1.5. Pro: Even for educational purposes, zoos are an obsolete tool because the workers don´t have any formation, or sensibility in animal ethics as we can see in the [reports](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qwr2zp1jcsbpklm/20150107_usda_ir_tiger_safari_73c0122_nci_002.pdf?dl=0) of Natural Bridge Zoo made by the USDA.
1.1.1.1.3.1.8.1.1.5.1. Pro: The workers without formation can work in jobs that are more appropriate for their formation. There are alternative jobs for veterinarians, biologists, caretakers and cleaning workers.
1.1.1.1.3.1.8.1.1.6. Pro: There is not a consensus across the institutions about [animal welfare](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258207166_Ethics_of_keeping_mammals_in_zoos_and_aquariums). Something which is not done correctly shouldn't be supported.
1.1.1.1.4. Con: In documentaries people are shown what the producer wants them to see, while in zoo's we can see the full development of a species behavior. With primates, for example, it is much easier to see the similarities they have with the humans and hence allowing for a greater connection between humans and primates. Therefore, people are more likely to take actions that protect primates.
1.1.1.2. Pro: David Attenborough's [Planet Earth II](http://www.metacritic.com/tv/planet-earth-ii) received massive critical acclaim.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: This was a great series, but did not produce a demonstrable lessening of interest in people going to zoos, probably quite the reverse.
1.1.1.3. Con: Seeing an animal in person is a much more memorable and educational experience than seeing that animal in a nature documentary.
1.1.1.4. Con: It is easy to show a biased view and manipulate footage. Even nature documentaries can fall victim to this. This could lead to people only seeing parts of animal behaviors that they find agreeable, instead of the entire package.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: The construction and choice of animals in zoos is also subject to these sorts of biases, so even if documentaries are flawed, that does not mean they will be worse than zoos.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: One cannot hide behaviors of animals in zoos though, even the unsavory ones. It is much easier to manipulate footage than to rid animals of these behaviors- some of these behaviors are even necessary to the animals survive, such as defecating, urinating, eating \(especially meat\), and mating.
1.1.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.1.8.1.1.3.
1.1.1.5. Pro: There is no need for zoos. The use of observation drones could enable humans to observe the animals close to real time in their natural habitat. This will draw attention to the condition of the habitat and will discourage poaching.
1.1.2. Con: It is easier to make zoos change to become more ethical than it is to create new and possibly imperfect substitutes to replace zoos.
1.1.2.1. Con: Many of the proposals for making zoos more ethical - for example, bigger, more accessible, less restricted enclosures - would serve to make zoos more dangerous for humans.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Humans may still choose to avoid the risk of getting hurt by not attending zoos. Animals, which have no say in the matter of their own environment, should be a priority.
1.1.2.2. Con: A zoo by definition is a cluster of enclosures of animals where people pay to view them. The only way to make zoos more ethical is to remove these core components. At this point it ceases to be a zoo.
1.1.3. Con: Funding is lacking terribly for conservation projects around the world. Even with funding, it doesn't guarantee success of conservation: if the government or [organized crime](http://www.ifaw.org/united-states/news/criminal-nature-%E2%80%93-dangerous-links-between-poaching-and-organized-crime) has more money, they can stifle conservation efforts — and usually do.
1.1.3.1. Pro: On top of all that, zoos actually provide funding for conservation projects around the world. AZA zoos [donate significant amounts of money to conservation](https://www.aza.org/conservation-funding).
1.1.3.1.1. Con: However, institutions are aiming to spend only [3%](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/dec/08/zoos-aquariums-conservation-animals-wildlife-funding) of their operational budget \(most spend even less\) on conservation. Therefore, even if zoo associations claim conservation should be their main purpose, it is not their first financial priority.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Available data from 2008 estimates that zoos in the US spent only [$0.50](https://news.mongabay.com/2014/05/the-quiet-zoo-revolution/) per visitor in conversation efforts.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Approximately [175 million](http://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/americas-most-visited-zoos) people visit a zoo or aquarium every year, making $0.50 per visitor a substantial sum that is spent on conservation effort every year.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: However, with admission tickets' prices ranging from around [$20](https://louisvillezoo.org/plan/prices/) to more than [$50](http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/tickets), dedicating only $0,50 to conservation efforts is a relatively low number, even if absolute sums are considerable.
1.1.3.2. Con: This is more an argument for better funding initiatives for conservation than it is for keeping zoos intact.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Zoos provide funding for conservation. That is one of the primary functions of zoos. Education, economic growth for a region, and conservation efforts are the three major benefits of zoos.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Zoos should be closed and funding should be funneled into conservation areas which have habitats more closely suited to the animal.
1.1.4. Con: Zoos provide a cheaper and more "close to home" method of seeing animals than traveling to the animal's natural habitat. This allows people without the funds to travel to be able to see these animals.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Zoos have been shown to have an incredible effect on young kids' interest in animals. Without the personal connection to seeing the animals in person, it is easy to detach from the animals on the other side of the planet.
1.1.4.2. Con: We have many tools to help us understand and respect things that we do not see with our own eyes. We understand and respect many things that we have never seen.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: Humans may respect concepts they have never seen, but often do not respect living beings/systems they do not see often. This is why we pollute, for example.
1.1.4.3. Con: An alternative method can be using technology to see the animals, not only going to their natural habitat.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Future advancements in Virtual Reality \(VR\) technology could enable us to simulate the experience of attending zoos.
1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: There already exists VR technology that allows [chickens](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10835849/Virtual-reality-for-chickens-fair-or-fowl.html) to experience a simulated version of roaming freely. This proves that the ability to simulate zoos isn't unrealistic.
1.1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: However the article referenced above also notes that a serious launch for this is far away.
1.1.4.3.1.2. Con: Zoos are great because they provide a unique experience at accessible prices. VR headsets are expensive and would likely make experiencing a zoo inaccessible to many people.
1.1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: As VR increases in popularity and usefulness for a huge variety of purposes, there will be pressure to make it more sophisticated and cheaper, increasing accessibility.
1.1.4.3.1.3. Con: Zoos are a tradition, and a visit to a zoo is a wholesome family activity.
1.1.4.3.1.3.1. Con: Harmful traditions shouldn't be continued.
1.1.4.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: Tradition is a very bad reason for continuing anything if the thing has negative consequences. People should be critical of traditions.
1.1.4.3.1.3.2. Con: Attending lynches used to be considered a wholesome family outing but is, understandably and correctly considered abominable in todays times. Human pleasure shouldn't be the reason for continuing any practice.
1.1.4.3.1.3.3. Con: Tradition doesn't automatically equal a good thing.
1.1.4.3.1.3.4. Pro: Zoos act as an affordable family-friendly arena for animal awareness and sensitization for people not as connected to nature and eco-trips.
1.1.4.3.1.4. Con: This could lead to a dangerous path of apathy and disintegration of humans from nature. Instead of experiencing it, they rely on technology to view it. Why care when you can turn off your VR machine and go on with your life?
1.1.4.3.1.5. Pro: Virtual reality experiences can still involve real world animal observation, with nature reserves hosting real-time 3D video feeds and telepresence robots. Instead of watching a lion in small enclosure, roam with the pack on the plains of the Serengeti.
1.1.4.3.1.6. Con: In our days the VR is starting to be considered as part of the normal life. For this reason, zoo's are a much more memorable experience for kids.
1.1.4.4. Pro: If zoos didn't exist, the only way people could visit animals would be in their natural environment, which could be disturbing for some species, and the unregulated human interruption in their lives would possibly threaten populations.
1.1.5. Con: Zoos should be preserved, but required to only have animals that are injured or cannot be released back into the wild. These "animal ambassadors" can educate and endear the public, while minimizing cruelty to animal species.
1.1.5.1. Con: Zoos primarily exist for displaying animals to entertain humans. Animal research can be performed effectively without the existence of zoos.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: Wild animal research requires massive amounts of funding and time. To learn about animals in the wild, one must identify individuals, track their behaviors and movements. Zoos allow research to keep close track of animals, including movements, diet, behaviors, and health conditions
1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Many animals live elusive lives in dense forests, remote mountains and deserts, or open oceans. These animals are hard to track, which makes learning about them rather difficult.
1.1.5.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.1.8.1.1.1.
1.1.5.1.1.3. Con: The work that zoos are doing with captive breeding, reintroduction, and headstarting is also [expensive](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235198941630138X).
1.1.5.1.2. Con: Researching wild animals puts the researchers at risk. Not only due to unpredictable wild animal behaviors, but also due to disease, adverse weather conditions, and organized criminals who do not want their poaching and habitat destroying behaviors to be compromised.
1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: An important part of animal research is also researching their habitat. Seeing that habitat firsthand can be essential to researchers despite the risks.
1.1.5.1.3. Con: Animals kept in jails for research and preservation only, without exhibition, have fewer people caring for their well-being as zoo visitors act like watchers.
1.1.5.1.4. Con: Although the concept of a zoological space did start as a way of expressing power and luxury, their mission has been changing over the years and does not reflect the ideas of the 19th century, when they first started to appear.
1.1.5.1.4.1. Pro: WAZA \(waza.org\) was created to regulate these spaces, with all of its members having to respect certain guidelines regarding the animal well-being \(enclosures, Environmental Enrichment, etc...\), their captive breeding and the actual Zoo research work.
1.1.5.1.4.2. Pro: A Zoo is obligated to maintain Environmental Enrichment in their enclosures. These serve the purpose of maintaining natural behaviours in their animals, such as searching for food or keeping a territory and you can read more about theme here: [zoo.pt](https://www.zoo.pt/site/index_en.php?content=192&subid=111); [zsl.org](https://www.zsl.org/enrichment-and-training-at-zsl)
1.1.5.1.5. Con: Zoos should not entertain but educate. So zoos should not be a boring place to be as then kids and adults won't learn about that animals are real, how they function and about their habitats.
1.1.5.1.6. Pro: It would be fair to keep animals in captivity for good reasons, yet if the intentions are based on selfish purposes, it is not. As long as zoos keep animals for the purpose of making profits, their actions are inherently bad.
1.1.5.2. Con: The point is not that some practices of specific zoos violate animals' rights but that instead the very notion of zoos violates these rights. No accreditation process or punishment can account for this.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: By the same logic, the raising of animals that have been domesticated for meat, milk or wool is violating their rights as well, not to mention the animals we keep in captivity as pets. They are not living their natural lives, and therefore having their rights violated.
1.1.5.2.1.1. Con: These examples all violate animal rights and should probably be stopped too.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Zoos are invaluable as an educational tool.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Many zoos provide presentations given by staff to educate the public on specific habitats, behaviors, and safety when encountering certain animals in the wild. This information can be life-saving, and thus important.
1.1.5.3.1.1. Con: The probability that this information will actually beneficially impact someone's life is minuscule, and probably outweighed by the probability of an accident at the zoo itself.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: Zoos put [humans](http://www.bornfreeusa.org/database/exo_incidents.php?&exocat=HI&facility=AZA&page=5) at an increased risk of being harmed by wild animals.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Many other activities \(hiking, sports\) involve some small risks of severe injury. That is not a reason to prohibit those activities.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: We permit these activities because we recognise that individuals can properly incorporate the risk into their decision-making, and because we realise that on net these activities are still beneficial. The same principles hold for zoos.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: These activities are overall a net-good for safety, since they involve considerable exercise which improves health. The same is not true for zoos.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Walking is a popular fitness activity that can be done in a zoo.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3. Con: The incidence of humans being harmed by animals in zoos is a tiny fraction of that of humans being harmed by wild animals in the wild.  Cases of a human being harmed at a zoo that aren't a direct result of that human's negligence, are virtually zero.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Animal attacks in the wild comes from uncautious human behaviour around wild animals. [www.wemjournal.org](https://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032\(97\)70944-X/pdf)
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.4. Pro: Animal transport associated with zoos may transfer [pathogens](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22902751) between different areas [exposing](https://modernfarmer.com/2018/04/a-petting-zoo-in-ri-is-making-people-sick-heres-why-and-how-to-prevent-it/) [animals](http://www.fv-berlin.de/news/viruses-jumping-species-and-zoo-polar-bear-disease?set_language=en) or local [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis#Exhibition) [populations](https://www.iol.co.za/the-star/news/kruger-park-on-alert-after-tb-claims-life-of-an-elephant-14538834) to [diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2546865/) they do not have the immunity to combat.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Human contact with animals in public settings can be a problem if measures to avoid [disease transmission](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5404a1.htm) and other health problems among visitors are not taken into account. Zoonoses or zoonotic diseases can be transmitted from animals to humans.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: According to the Humane Society of the United States, [petting zoos](http://animalrightscoalition.com/doc/petting_zoo_factsheet.pdf) with wild and domestic animals on display for visitors to touch need special consideration. More than 75 zoonotic diseases can be transmitted from animals to people, many without direct physical contact, including rabies, salmonellosis, toxoplasmosis, and E. coli. Children, pregnant women, and the elderly are especially at risk.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: A 2004 review identified around 25 human infectious disease outbreaks from 1990 to 2000 associated with visitors to [animal exhibits](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5404a1.htm).
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.4.3. Con: [Laws](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/nvap/NVAP-Reference-Guide/Animal-Movement/interstate-regulations) have been passed within the last 20 years which regulate this.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.4.4. Con: A [vet](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/nvap/NVAP-Reference-Guide/Animal-Movement/issuing-international-health-certificates-for-live-animal-movement) can certify an animal's health before transport.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.4.5. Con: Factory farming [presents](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/5-modern-diseases-on-the-rise-because-of-factory-farming/) similar health risks.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.5. Con: According to [official data](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/05/harambe-gorillas-zoos-safety-incidents-animals/) from the United States, the risk seems to be very low.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: Since 1990 only [15](http://www.bornfreeusa.org/database/exo_incidents.php?startyear=1990&endyear=2017&exocat=HD&facility=AZA) people died due to incidents with animals in AZA-accredited zoos, and only an additional [18](http://www.bornfreeusa.org/database/exo_incidents.php?startyear=1990&endyear=2017&exocat=HD&facility=RSZ) in non-accredited zoos, making a total of only 33.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.5.2. Pro: Since 1990 only 110 people were injured in incidents with animals in the US.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.5.3. Con: Attacks from large cats are uncommon in the United States, but there is a significant number since most of them are kept in unregulated zoos. The number of attacks of captive predators are on the rise. [www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6311825_Captive_tiger_attack_Case_report_and_review_of_the_literature)
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.6. Pro: Tiger bites can result in death to humans. [www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379073817301822)
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.7. Pro: Public awareness of real dangers of wild animals in zoological parks is poor. [www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309286806_Zoo_animals_and_humans_killed_because_of_human_negligent_behavior)
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.8. Pro: There are different levels of risk according to different visitors background. [eds.a.ebscohost.com](https://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=1&sid=d6ad22f9-8cc7-4a00-8a64-972b2bfc98f1%40sdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLGNvb2tpZSxzaGliLHVpZCZsYW5nPXB0LWJyJnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=129553787&db=bth)
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.9. Con: Strict security [measures](http://www.hse.gov.uk/pUbns/priced/hsg219.pdf) are put in place \(e.g. using thick ballistic glass\) so that animal enclosures are secure. Zoos can increase them to minimise the already low risks.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.9.1. Con: The security measures of Ontario Zoos keeps below standard after 10 years. [www.zoocheck.com](http://www.zoocheck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Zoos-in-Ontario.pdf) [www.zoocheck.com](http://www.zoocheck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WSPAOntarioZooReport2005.pdf)
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.9.2. Con: Despite these 'strict' measures, the fact that incidents continue to occur suggests that these risks are inherent to zoos.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.10. Pro: Humans have been [killed or critically injured](https://www.romper.com/p/how-many-zoo-accidents-are-there-per-year-theyre-rare-largely-avoidable-11784) by zoo animals on multiple occasions over the years.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.10.1. Con: Attending a zoo has a lower risk than many other activities that would be substituted such as using a playground for example.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.10.2. Con: Most of such cases are caused during violating zoo's policies, such as trespassing in off limits areas.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.11. Pro: [Children](http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/30/health/zoo-safety/) sometimes ignore or don't understand warning signs at zoos. Without proper adult supervision, some have been severely [injured](http://www.bornfreeusa.org/database/exo_incident.php?id=2177) or [killed](http://www.bornfreeusa.org/database/exo_incident.php?id=1870).
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.11.1. Con: There are more dangers to a child under the supervision of an unobservant care giver going to the store than there are going to the zoo, especially from the animals that are in enclosures designed to keep them secure. Those features have to be bypassed in order for humans to be at risk.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.11.2. Con: The same argument could be made about roads and road signs, yet it is undeniable the value roads bring to society. Just because something presents preventable risks does not mean it should be banned.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.11.3. Con: As long as the zoo has the appropriate signs and security measures, this is the responsibility of the guardians bringing the children to the zoo, not of the zoo itself.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.11.3.1. Pro: In the US, a lot of incidents involving children being injured or [killed](http://www.bornfreeusa.org/database/exo_incident.php?id=1870) have happened due to parents' irresponsible [action](http://www.bornfreeusa.org/database/exo_incident.php?id=2423) or [inaction](http://www.bornfreeusa.org/database/exo_incident.php?id=2177).
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.11.3.1.1. Con: A way to avoid this would be by thoroughly educating visitors before they are granted full entrance to the zoos.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.11.4. Pro: This resulted in the death of [Harambe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Harambe#Harambe), a 17 year old Western lowland gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo in 2016. These incidents are not only life-threatening for children, but for the animals as well.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.11.4.1. Con: Closing zoos due to an animal being killed because a child had an unobservant guardian would be unreasonable. By the same logic, we should ban cars because children are run over on streets every day because they got away from their care givers.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.11.4.2. Con: Since 1990 only 42 animals have [died](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/05/harambe-gorillas-zoos-safety-incidents-animals/) in escapes or attacks in the US.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.12. Con: People are capable of rationally assessing the risks of entering a zoo and weighing it against the happiness gained from doing so. Given that many people choose to enter zoos, it is likely that the happiness gained outweighs the very small risk.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.12.1. Con: People may be ignorant about the risks, or careless once they enter the zoo. They do not necessarily act rationally.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.12.2. Con: Viewing nature documentaries makes you happier. [asset-manager.bbcchannels.com](https://asset-manager.bbcchannels.com/workspace/uploads/bbcw-real-happiness-white-paper-final-v2-58ac1df7.pdf) Only visitors that observe behaviorally healthy animals are more likely to appreciate what they are seeing. [pdfs.semanticscholar.org](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a2fe/b3fd269ee2479539c66b8555bbcd483d95c8.pdf)
1.1.5.3.1.1.2. Pro: In order for this information to be beneficial, someone would have to end up in a situation with a wild animal such that the information is directly relevant, and have to perfectly recall the information.
1.1.5.3.1.2. Pro: Zoos use a relatively small number of animals to raise public awareness, possibly changing public perception, which in turn changes political and economic outcomes. When introducing millions of children to animals, those children grow up to be voters and consumers biased by their experience there, possibly making decisions that are "better" for the animals.
1.1.5.3.2. Pro: [Studies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11165-016-9513-2) show that encountering living animals in a formal learning arrangement leads to higher achievement and closes gender disparities in achievement. They have shown to be more effective methods than just teaching at school.
1.1.5.3.3. Pro: Zoos provide exposure to a variety of animals which we wouldn't encounter otherwise.
1.1.5.3.3.1. Con: We can encounter these animals through virtual mediums - films, documentaries, or books.
1.1.5.3.3.1.1. Pro: Documentaries are an invaluable educational tool too. They are non-intrusive, highly informative, and allow us to see animals in the wild in their natural habitats without confining them to captivity.
1.1.5.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Documentaries are not immersive, you cannot experience even partial immersion in nature from a documentary.
1.1.5.3.3.1.2. Con: Though documentary films are incredibly useful, it is clear that we live in a world with an unfortunate amount of disconnect when seeing things on a screen. Tangible experiences can provide for a deeper connection to the problem.
1.1.5.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.5.3.3.3. Con: Insofar as zoos cause direct animal suffering, we should prioritize that over intangible benefits \(such as increased empathy or knowledge about animals\).
1.1.5.3.3.4. Pro: Exposure to the vast variety of living creatures on earth can inspire visitors to protect all ecosystems on our planet not just the ones local to them.
1.1.5.3.3.5. Pro: Zoos allow for animals from all around the world to be held in one place.
1.1.5.3.3.6. Pro: Exposure to the natural world at an early age is important for children to develop both empathy for and an understanding of our planets co-inhabitants.
1.1.5.3.3.6.1. Con: The access to zoos allows humans to see animals as an object of amusement, giving the human a feeling of power and superiority to them. This can lead to animal abuse, not caring properly for them, because zoo’s don’t properly care for them and that is what we all see, and having no emotion or mercy towards animal species.
1.1.5.3.3.7. Con: People might see an animal, but they will never see an animal in its original habitat or its original personality.
1.1.5.3.3.8. Pro: Seeing animals in zoos when they otherwise wouldn't see them at all makes people more empathetic to wider arguments for animal welfare and habitat preservation because these animals are no longer abstract concepts seen only in pictures.
1.1.5.3.3.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.3.3.
1.1.5.3.3.9. Con: [There is no thrill in seeing an animal caged versus seeing it in it's natural habitat.](https://goo.gl/images/mYTeCA)  Anything less simply feeds the human ego.  For example, seeing an animal in Zoo is self serving, but seeing one in the wild is raw and allowing the animal to self serve.
1.1.5.3.3.10. Con: If humans would never otherwise encounter an animal, it is unclear why they require education on it.
1.1.5.3.3.10.1. Con: It is important for people to become aware of the negative impact humans have on animals and their habitat, whether we encounter them or not.
1.1.5.3.3.10.1.1. Pro: Zoos offer a way for people of many different backgrounds to foster empathy for animals and reflect on how their own behavior impacts animals globally.
1.1.5.3.3.10.2. Con: Being exposed to sights that people otherwise would not encounter may lead to an increased interest to learn more about animals. People do not need to actually encounter animals to have use of learning about them.
1.1.5.3.3.10.3. Con: Learning about animals we may rarely encounter provides [technological inspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics).
1.1.5.3.4. Con: [A curator at the National Zoo](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/animals-used-entertainment-factsheets/zoos-pitiful-prisons/) followed more than 700 zoo visitors and found that most visitors spend only a few minutes at each display, seeking entertainment rather than enlightenment.
1.1.5.3.4.1. Con: A large [study](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/largest_international_study/) with more than 6,000 participants found a 5% increase in the knowledge of biodiversity the visitors had after visiting a zoo.
1.1.5.3.4.1.1. Con: However, some [authors](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-bekoff/its-not-happening-at-the-zoo_b_6315614.html) claim that an increase of more than 5% of a very large sample does not show that people get educated in a meaningful way in zoos, nor does it show if what people learn will contribute to future efforts favouring animal wellbeing.
1.1.5.3.4.1.2. Pro: Visitors were also more able to identify individual actions that they could carry out to help [protect](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/largest_international_study/) biodiversity.
1.1.5.3.4.2. Con: Regardless of what visitors seek to gain from spending time at a zoo, they may find themselves interested to learn more about animals after visiting due to being exposed to live animals in person.
1.1.5.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.1.8.1.1.
1.1.5.3.6. Pro: This education means that people are likely to better understand \(and care about\) the plight of animals in the wild.
1.1.5.3.6.1. Con: Alternatively, zoos could desensitize people to animal cruelty and reduce the likelihood of sympathy for broader animal rights causes.
1.1.5.3.6.1.1. Pro: [Many zoos](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/25/worlds-leading-zoo-association-overlooked-horrific-cruelty-to-animals) force their animals to perform in cruel displays.
1.1.5.3.6.1.2. Pro: The very act of gawking at imprisoned and confined animals is a manifestation of a cruel and insensitive attitude towards those animals.
1.1.5.3.6.1.3. Con: Zoos generally try to make people aware of how to ethically treat their animals - for example, by banning people from tossing food to animals, or showing [zoo employees feeding animals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpJqfGwkkHU) in often affectionate ways.
1.1.5.3.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.3.3.
1.1.5.3.6.3. Pro: The ability to see existing conservation methods, struggles and results in person can be inspiring to the next generation of zoologists and ecologists.
1.1.5.3.6.4. Pro: This can lead to increased donations for animal conservation causes.
1.1.5.3.6.5. Pro: Zoos connect humans with nature and are likely to make more people care about wildlife preservation.
1.1.5.3.6.5.1. Pro: Zoos create animal-loving children who will become animal rights defending adults.
1.1.5.3.7. Con: Society historically enjoy spectacles under the guise of education. Zoos are little more than moving images for humans to gawk.
1.1.5.3.7.1. Con: Zoos play a critical role in the conservation of endangered species.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1. Pro: At the very least, zoos should therefore not be forbidden for animals at risk of extinction.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1. Pro: Zoos save endangered species by bringing them into a safe environment, where they are protected from poachers, habitat loss, starvation, and predators. Due to these many dangers they will undoubtedly continue to face in the wild, zoos are necessary for their survival.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Around [90%](https://www.vegansociety.com/whats-new/blog/zoos-great-education-and-conservation-myth) of species in [European](http://endcap.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Animal-Ark-or-sinking-ship.pdf) zoos are not endangered and half of the [breeding](https://www.captiveanimals.org/news/2014/02/almost-half-of-species-part-of-zoo-breeding-programmes-are-not-endangered#_ftn1) programs do not involve endangered species either.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1.2. Con: Local endangered populations are often protected through other mechanisms, for example sanctuaries and national parks. Given this, zoos are unnecessary.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The revenue that visitors to zoos bring could be, and under the status quo often is, used to fund these conservation efforts. Eliminating zoos would eliminate this source of revenue for conservation efforts.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: San Diego Zoo [admissions and membership prices](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/watchdog/sdut-zoo-100-finances-2016sep12-htmlstory.html) are the most expensive among public and non-profit zoos, helping them fund conservation programs in the US and globally.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1.3. Pro: For some species, poaching is so [severe](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/03/zoos-security-animal-poaching-threat) that zoos are increasing security measures. If even captive animals can be under threat, wild animals are in a much worse position, highlighting the necessity of zoos.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.2. Pro: Siberian Tigers, Silverback/Great Apes, White Rhinos have been put in zoos for the continuation of the species.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.3. Pro: Many zoos also have [breeding programs](https://www.thoughtco.com/zoos-and-endangered-species-conservation-1182068) for endangered species, as in the wild, these individuals might have trouble finding mates and breeding.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.3.1. Con: Captive breeding often leads to inbreeding, lacks sustainability, and causes other breeding related problems.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Zoos try to optimise the [genetic management](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22753040/) of closed populations, yet studies have found that they are not able to meet their goals. More combined strategies and more research on genetic, physiological, behavioural and morphological variation are needed.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: [Sustaining](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4430766/) genetic diversity and being able to preserve wild genetic characteristics in captive animals, so the species conserved is similar to its wild state, is very challenging for zoos: the environment is very different and inbreeding is common.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.3.1.3. Con: [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4430766/) and efforts are being made to reduce the evolutionary consequences of captive breeding in order to sustain captive species that match their wild counterparts.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.3.1.4. Pro: Animals who are solitary in the wild and only meet during estrus, can have behavioural problems when are housed in captivity near their mates. This can lead to sexual aggression and sexual [incompatibility](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4430766/).
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.3.1.5. Con: In AZA facilities [studbooks](https://www.aza.org/studbooks) are kept to keep the population as genetically diverse as possible. These also serve to keep subspecies pure.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.3.1.6. Con: It is true that captive breeding has negative consequences due to low variation in the population. However, low population is already a problem for endangered species. So captive breeding may be the only option to sustain the species.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.3.1.7. Pro: Captive breeding of dolphins is not beneficial in terms of conservation. Based on the problem of inbreeding, the costs involved and the ethics of capturing more dolphins from the wild, the [low success](http://www.zoocheck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AcresDolphinReport.pdf) of captive breeding programs, clearly, practical conservation measures in the wild should be the recommended preservation strategy for endangered dolphins.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.3.1.8. Pro: The [population growth](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215519237_Captive_Breeding_Zoos_and_Good_Sense) is one of the major problems of captive breeding, which can lead to unsustainable management and consequently the frequent use of euthanasia.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.3.2. Pro: St. Louis Zoo is in part responsible for the number of cheetahs we still have. Breeding programs are important when there are declining populations in the wild. We may be looking at a time where the only safe place for animals, like elephants, is in zoos. St. Louis Zoo does their best by the animals they keep.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.4. Con: Zoos are not necessary for conservation. We can conserve endangered species in protected or artificial habitats, without opening up those habitats to public entry to stare at the animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.5. Con: Given the large number of non-endangered animals in zoos, being able to house only endangered species would drastically reduce their exhibits and probably their visitors, thus complicating their economic viability.
1.1.5.3.7.1.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2. Con: Only a small part of the animals in a zoo are there for conservation. The vast majority are not.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1. Con: The zoo needs to get money from animals that people would like to see, and are not necessarily endangered, to ensure the preservation of the ones that actually are.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1. Con: Even though endangered species may not make up the majority of a zoo's animals, having even just one endangered/visiting animal can draw many visitors. In this way, endangered animals may provide more return-on-investment than any other animal in the zoo.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Some animals are more 'popular' than others because they are bigger, nonexistent in a given country, more difficult to see in the wild or just better known to the general population. The fact that one animal is endangered \(and therefore rare\) does not automatically mean it attracts more visitors.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Zoo officials [usually favor exotic or popular animals](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/animals-used-entertainment-factsheets/zoos-pitiful-prisons/) who attract crowds and publicity, rather than threatened or endangered local wildlife.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1.2.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: 'Large, charismatic animals such as pandas, tigers or elephants draw the crowds. These flagship species help to raise the profile and funds for in-situ conservation efforts for the not so well known species. For example, there aren’t many visitors who would be passionate about protecting frogs or other amphibians yet [zoos](https://theconversation.com/in-defence-of-zoos-how-captivity-helps-conservation-56719) have been instrumental in preventing the loss of a large part of the world’s frog fauna.'.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: We can save endangered animals without objectifying others to produce financial support to do so.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Animals that are perceived to be entertaining and cute are clearly [favoured](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211973616300708) by zoo visitors, unfavouring some species from being selected by zoos.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: [Pandas](https://smartasset.com/taxes/the-economics-of-zoos) are the few animals zoos pay for, as they are controlled by the Chinese government. A mating pair can cost up to $1 million and a cub $600,000. That money would be better spent in fighting against habitat destruction or helping wild animals directly.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Zoo Atlanta has contributed over 10 million dollars towards [giant panda conservation](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/29/us/iyw-panda-conservation-zoo-atlanta/index.html) efforts in China. Most of these funds are allocated to research, reforestation, equipment, and building protection stations.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: The addition of two pandas [boosted](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/07/edinburgh-zoo-pandas-profits-increase) the Edinburgh zoo's income from £5 million to nearly £15 million and visitors increased by 51%. Zoo officials say the high price to keep the pandas \($1 million per year paid to the Chinese government\) is worth it, as extra ticket sales and merchandise have more than covered the costs.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.4.3. Pro: To maximise revenue, the Edinburgh Zoo [trademarked](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/07/edinburgh-zoo-pandas-profits-increase) the Pandas' names to ban any other retailers from using them to sell merchandise.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.4.2.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.2.3. Pro: Very few captive display facilities are involved in worthwhile [cetaceans conservation programs](https://awionline.org/sites/default/files/publication/digital_download/AWI-ML-WhalesDolphinsCaptivityEnglish.pdf) in the wild.
1.1.5.3.7.1.3. Pro: Zoos are crucial for the survival of many endangered species, especially for smaller animals like [amphibians](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12563/abstract).
1.1.5.3.7.1.3.1. Pro: For example, the Taronga Zoo's Coroboree Tree Frog breeding [program](https://taronga.org.au/animal/corroboree-frog).
1.1.5.3.7.1.3.2. Con: [Zoos](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/cobi.12563?referrer_access_token=rLdWd7GfXGELRitfwqOW14ta6bR2k8jH0KrdpFOxC66EQBMjXP295A07RHkMWPDrGNzp1Z1D6dbWOsYwd_6T0iKyZjXKfH8u9_KB92243RL7wLddRl5cGFflfHDPaqE4) are failing in amphibian species conservation. "More than 75 percent of their amphibian collections included non-endangered species. Even worse, they held just 6.2 percent of the world’s threatened amphibian species.".
1.1.5.3.7.1.3.3. Con: A [large audience](https://journals.openedition.org/sapiens/1406) is still unaware of the importance of the amphibian crisis and its consequences, much because of zoos are still not sufficiently compromised to that cause.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4. Con: Humans do not have a right to breed, capture and confine other animals, even if they are endangered. Being a member of an endangered species doesn't mean the individual animals have fewer rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.1. Con: Given that most species are only endangered because of human interference, zoos are rectifying the natural order, not meddling in it.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.1.1. Con: By providing a method to avoid their extinction, zoos justify the captivity of animals instead of the protection of them and their habitats. This perpetuates the harm instead of rectifying it.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2. Con: Even if zoos violate animal rights, allowing a species to go extinct due to human recklessness is a far bigger violation. We should thus err on the side of protecting the most significant right, that to continued existence.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1. Con: Conservation can be achieved without keeping animals in artificial captive environments.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.1. Con: We can have government-run conservation projects under the status quo; the existence of zoos allows us to have even more conservation than what governments are willing to provide.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Efforts can be made to conserve and protect the habitats of animals instead of keeping animals in captivity while their natural homes are still being destroyed.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.2.1. Con: In order to prevent the need for the safeguard that zoos supply, more needs to be done to reverse or at very least stop the habitat loss of animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.2.2. Con: Zoos actually play a huge role in educating people to habitat preservation, teaching their public the problems that species face in their natural habitat, what are the causes, and what we can do to solve them.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Zoos do much to educate people about the importance of species and thier role in the balance of the planet. Without this education, many people who live in urban places would not have any knowledge first hand of how magnificent animals are, or know that we need to protect them.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: The [outputs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22674295) from zoo education are indeed vast, but not necessarily reliable indicators of the zoos educational achievements. Quantity does not necessarily equate to quality, in fact most of the times is the opposite, just as outputs do not necessarily lead to outcomes
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.2.2.2. Con: We can learn about the importance of species online. If we had learned that importance of that balance in life, we wouldn't be taking them captive against their will.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.2.3. Pro: There is no point in observing animals outside of their habitat and it is also cruel to keep them in captivity. We should setup habitats for animals and then visit as part of annual holidays.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.3. Con: Zoos and wild environments can exist together. Zoos provide a necessary backup, especially for animals with unstable populations and habitats.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.3.1. Pro: Zoo populations and environments can be controlled in ways that natural environments cannot be. This allows those that run zoos to ensure maximum safety and comfort for their animals and protect them from such hazards as deforestation and climate change.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.3.2. Pro: Instead of banning zoos, we ought to more heavily regulate them to ensure that they provide good standards of care for animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.4. Pro: Wild environments can do a better job of protecting the survival of endangered animals if the area is patrolled to control poaching.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.4.1. Con: Patrols are very expensive and it is difficult to keep track of all endangered animals. Poachers can easily avoid these patrols and capture a single animal.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.4.2. Con: Animals can be killed in the wild by accidents and other animals/predators. As animals have no concept of an endangered species, this would be a natural behaviour that park rangers could not control in a non-captive environment.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.4.3. Con: Protecting endangered animals in the wild requires huge amounts of supplies and funding to fight [organized poaching](http://dx.doi.org.sci-hub.cc/10.1080/02681307.2016.1252127). Conservation organizations rarely have access to more funding than these groups. Currently, conservationists are [losing this battle](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12082/full).
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.5. Con: Zoos are especially necessary for species that are critically endangered and that can't survive in their natural habitat, e.g., South China tiger
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.6. Con: Zoos have a level of security that national parks do not that can stop poaching.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.4.3.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.6.2. Pro: Zoos have much [harsher](https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/510080/guide-exhibited-animals-general.pdf) guidelines to adhere to than national parks, as well as having more funding.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.7. Con: More than an active conservation effort, a zoo strives to work in conservation through the education of its visitors, wich is way harder to do in a natural park.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.8. Con: Many of the conservation projects that are active through the world are funded by zoos
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.8.1. Pro: The Lisbon Zoo, for example, has a [Conservation Fund](https://www.zoo.pt/site/index_en.php?content=192&subid=190) that is used to help or even create conservation projects all over the world.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.8.2. Pro: For keeping some animals, a zoo has to pay some amount of money to conservation efforts of that species, much like zoo's have to pay China to keep Giant Pandas.

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9. Pro: Captivity is harmful to animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1. Pro: Animals confined to zoos suffer negative psychological effects.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1. Con: We should not care about the suffering that this causes animals, since we have no moral obligation to protect the wellbeing of animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1. Pro: Animals do not have rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1. Con: Regardless of whether or not they currently do, animals should have rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many animals kept in zoos \(e.g. [orangutans](http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/75471069/orangutans-are-as-human-as-we-are-says-australian-orangutan-whisperer) and other primate species\) show signs of advanced sentience and we should thus respect their rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many studies have shown that [animals possess characteristics](http://www.livescience.com/39481-time-to-declare-animal-sentience.html) associated with sentience.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Neuroscience proves](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-02/nrn-updating-animal-welfare/7987266?pfmredir=sm) animals experience a wide range of emotions.

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: These same species are often at risk of extinction in the wild. Insofar as they deserve rights, the right to continued existence is a pretty critical one.

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.3.2. Con: Zoos in Western countries receive [funding](https://smartasset.com/taxes/the-economics-of-zoos) from donors and governments. Those contributions could be invested in animal conservation in struggling countries, thus protecting endangered species instead of going to zoo’s operational budgets.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Chester Zoo spent  £40 million on a project called [Islands](http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/islands-chester-zoo-opens-public-9634020), a recreation of several South East Asia islands for some of their resident animals. At the same time, the [Kenya Wildlife Service](http://www.kws.go.ke/content/annual-reports) \(KWS\), an organisation that protects animals in situ, has less than half that budget.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Many animals in situ [face poaching](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-rhinos/despite-armed-guards-africas-rhinos-losing-battle-to-poachers-idUSBRE93A0WP20130411), which is not a problem for zoo animals.

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.2. Con: Zoos and zookeepers are experts at keeping and looking after animals. Governments and donors are not as competent at protecting endangered species. This is why they fund zoos to do it instead of directly investing into animal conservation themselves.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Governments can create wildlife protection agencies or institutions that have the ability to take care of animals in their habitat, there is no need for conservation efforts to be made by donors or patrons themselves.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Sentience is the characteristic by which we justify most human rights. When animals show it, they too are deserving of special protections.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: There are many humans - for example, infants or the severely cognitively disabled - whose levels of sentience are lower than most animals. Insofar as we should morally protect these people, we should also morally protect animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5. Con: Zoos played an important role in the [discovery](http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/75471069/orangutans-are-as-human-as-we-are-says-australian-orangutan-whisperer) of advanced sentience within orangutans, which led to some people recognizing that animals should have rights. Zoos are necessary to keep up beneficial work like this.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Beneficial science does not justify cruel conditions. At the point we recognise animal's sentience, we need to respect it.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2. Pro: Zoos can sometimes help to advance animal rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Zoos can engender people's sympathy for animals that they would otherwise know nothing about or feel no connection to, causing them to support animal rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Going to a zoo can trigger [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) for people who hold beliefs that animals should be treated well but have yet to be confronted with the reality of how unjust animal imprisonment is.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: However people may also turn against zoos when this cognitive dissonance is triggered.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.1.2. Con: Creating this type of awareness for how unjust animal imprisonment is would not be necessary if zoos did not exist in the first place.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.2. Pro: A [study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cura.12188/full) on the impact of zoo visits shows that direct experiences with animals can increase public engagement. A zoo visit can positively influence people by enhancing environmental concern, conservation knowledge, and their capacity to act upon these.

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.2. Con: Violating animal rights in order to protect more animal rights in the future is still immoral. We would not allow forcible medical experimentation on humans, even if in the long run that protected humans' rights to life better.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: There is no guarantee that there is an exponential positive effect of violating one animal's rights on the future rights of other animals. Unless a study shows how many animals' rights were preserved as a direct consequence of someone being motivated by a zoo, the idea that zoos can motivate people to stand for animal rights cannot be validated.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.3. Con: The amount which zoos aid in improving animal rights is uncertain. The harm that is caused while locking animals up is not.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.3.1. Con: Many wild species actually thrive in captivity. They live longer, healthier lives, and show [similar](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/bambi-or-bessie-are-wild-animals-happier/) amounts of stress hormones as wild animals, but also live longer and healthier due to the constant and balanced nutrition and the medical check ups and care they receive.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.3.1.1. Con: Stress hormones are not a good indicator of overall happiness or satisfaction. Perhaps the stress hormone levels of human prisoners who lead a sedandary life might be lesser than a medical doctor who has huge responsibilities, but that does not mean the doctor is less happy or satisfied than the prisoner.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.4. Pro: Animals have the basic right of existing. We are violating this right by destroying their natural habitat \(deforestation, pollution, climate change,...\). Zoos provide a backup habitat to them in compensation to this violation.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.4.1. Con: Zoos would provide a backup habitat if they prioritized local endangered species whose habitat is destroyed or compromised, or endangered species in general. However, zoos often follow commercial logic while choosing their animals.

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.4.2. Con: Animal sanctuaries and rescue operations can provide all of the care and protection of injured or endangered species zoos do, while prioritizing the well-being of the animals over the entertainment of human patrons.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.4.2.1. Pro: Here is a great example of what a sanctuary can be like. [wildanimalsanctuary.org](https://www.wildanimalsanctuary.org/about-us)
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.4.3. Con: A prison cannot be considered a 'backup habitat'.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.5. Pro: [Research](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/47940997/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/what-were-they-thinking-studies-reveal-animal-intellect/#.WT_5Z2jyhPY) at zoos has helped us understand how intelligent monkeys are, making us realize how little the difference between humans and monkeys is. This increased scientific understanding has led to more ethical debates on animal treatment.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.5.1. Con: The ability of zoos to convince us that animals are morally worthy is undermined by the fact that zoos simultaneously treat animals in degrading and cruel ways. Other institutions could better send the message that animals are morally important.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.5.1.1. Con: The entertainment that zoos uniquely bring is what piques the interest of citizens who are not invested. Other institutions are unable to engage citizens enough to make them care.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.5.2. Con: Zoos often keep animals that are interesting to look at rather than interesting to research. Zoos should only be permitted to have those animals on which active research is being conducted.

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.3. Con: Philosophers in ancient times and during the Enlightenment era discussed animals' ability to suffer and the improvement of their conditions before [modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo#The_modern_zoo) zoos were properly developed in the 19th century.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Ancient thinkers Plutarch, Hippocrates and Pythagoras were all advocates [for the fair treatment of animals](http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/2/4/628/htm).
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.3.2. Pro: During the 18th century and the age of the Enlightenment we saw great changes in how animals were viewed, with a number of philosophers discussing the [ability of animals to suffer \(sentience\).](http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/2/4/628/htm)
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.3.2.1. Pro: Jeremy Bentham, a central figure in the late English Enlightenment, considered the suffering of animals to be [a matter of ethical concern](http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/2/4/628/htm) for utilitarian thinking, famously asking “The question is not, Can they reason? nor Can they talk? but Can they suffer?”
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.3.3. Con: Discussing animals' ability to suffer means nothing if it does not lead to improved animal treatment. Modern zoos that have heavily invested into improving animal well-being in different ways, as well as done research that has improved our understanding of animals, directly contributed to progressing animal rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.6. Pro: In [Argentina](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-30571577), an orangutan has been granted basic legal rights enjoyed by humans.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.6.1. Pro: This includes a right to freedom which needs to be defended.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Animals are sufficiently sophisticated that we should grant them rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: No matter what criterion of moral considerability you choose, there is always some overlap between humans and animals in possessing this criterion, so if you exclude animals from being morally considerable, you also exclude some humans.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: We already exclude some humans from equal rights. An example of this is nations hosting refugees not granting them equal rights to their own citizens. This is based on an arbitrary separation of borders that we accept in order to have a functional society.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: This shows that it can be morally acceptable to discriminate in ways that have no "impartial" justification, if doing so helps us protect and benefit our communities and the people close to us. A similar argument applies to discriminating against animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Discriminating against refugees make nations hypocrites, because they still advocate the principles of equal human rights. Nations cannot be hypocrites if it's morally acceptable to discriminate. This proves that discrimination is morally unacceptable.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Upholding the principles of equal human rights is more important than ensuring marginal benefits to the community. Equally, ensuring fair animal treatment should trump the marginal benefits derived from treating them poorly.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Although we might deny refugees certain rights, like the right to welfare or to vote, we would not be justified in denying them more fundamental rights like freedom from significant harm. Our ability to discriminate in granting people rights is very limited.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Perhaps we should ban certain animals, like higher primates, whose intelligence levels overlap with those of humans, from being displayed in zoos. This does not mean we should ban zoos altogether.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: It is clear that many animals in zoos \([birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_intelligence), [reptiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile), etc\) do not possess nearly the same level of cognitive sophistication as infants or severely disabled people.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: As far as we can tell, many non-human animals possess [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness#Cambridge_Declaration_on_Consciousness) similarly to humans.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: Many theories of moral considerability focus on intelligence, rationality, or cognitive ability. Yet many humans - like babies, and individuals who are severely cognitively impaired - are less intelligent, rational, or cognitively able than many animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Babies have the potential to grow into humans who are more rational or intelligent than all animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: This still does not explain why we owe duties to severely cognitively disabled humans, who do not have the potential to grow into fully intelligent humans.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Fetuses also have the potential to grow into healthy humans, but we generally believe that abortion is permissible, so possessing this potentiality cannot make something morally important.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Babies have a guaranteed future; fetuses do not. The potential future of babies is therefore important, while that of fetuses is not.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: The guarantee of future prospects is not the standard we use to evaluate wrongness of death. For instance, it is as wrong to kill a baby as it is to kill a 100 year old.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.2. Con: It is clear that infants are relevantly different from fetuses: supporting abortion does not imply supporting infanticide. Infants have passed some sort of threshold which makes them more morally important.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.4. Con: We do not grant rights on an individual basis; rather, we grant rights to blanket groups. Insofar as we believe in "human rights", we should grant these rights to all humans.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Granting rights to blanket groups, rather than on an individual basis, is arbitrary. If an individual lacks the necessary capacities to have rights, there is no reason why their membership of a group or species should give them that right.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: This might be principally true but in practice it is impossible to evaluate every individual's capacity to have rights. Hence we default to a species-based definition.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.4.1.2. Pro: For example, suppose a chimpanzee was genetically engineered to have the intelligence of a human. It would make no sense to deny this chimpanzee rights just because the rest of their species is less intelligent.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Severely cognitively disabled humans belong to a morally important 'type': humanity. This is sufficient to grant them moral considerability.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.4.3. Con: Even if this is true, it does not prevent us from granting rights or moral consideration to other non-human animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.4.3.1. Pro: Children and those declared mentally incompetent have no legal standing, but instead have someone with guardianship or power of attorney represent their interests. Something similar could be done for animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5. Con: We owe duties to infants or cognitively disabled people on the basis of our shared species membership. We owe no such duties to animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1. Con: Attempts to differentiate between humans and animals on the basis of species and without good reason are [speciesism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism), a baseless prejudice similar to racism or sexism.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1. Con: Unlike racism or sexism, there are huge and relevant differences between humans and animals. Animals will never be able to fully participate in society with us or interact with us in meaningful ways, nor will they ever possess anything approaching our level of cognitive sophistication. It is therefore acceptable to discriminate on the basis of species-membership.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.1. Con: While animals will likely never fully be part of human society, they often organize their communities in similar ways. We should not discriminate against lifeforms whose social organization is similar to ours.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Animal communities do not possess concepts of intrinsic dignity \(they may possess concepts of status, but these are hierarchical\). Even if we should respect their communities, that does not mean we should think animals have dignity.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Dignity is a relativistic social construct even within humans. It varies depending on time, place, culture, etc. It is not fixed nor intrinsic. We manage to extend the concept of dignity to other non-real concepts \(religious symbols or flags\). There is no reason we could not extend dignity to encompass animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: A study conducted in Uganda found that Chimpanzees [go to war](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/jun/21/chimpanzees-territory-killing-neighbours) in order to expand territory and find new mates and resources.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.1.3. Pro: Monkeys develop [economies](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/11/02/economics.monkey.business/index.html), exchanging services like grooming and sex for favors or resources.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Evidence of transactional relationships does not indicate a respect for dignity. In this case, each animal is merely concerned with their own self-interest; they do not care about the other animal.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Humans have also been said to [act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene) only in self-interest.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.1.4. Pro: Cleaner fish live off providing a service to larger fish. When one cleaner misbehaves and chases away a "customer", other fish will [punish](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/01/100108-cleaner-fish-punish/) their behavior.

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.2. Con: Many humans do not "fully participate in society or interact in meaningful ways" either through choice or inability.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.3. Con: There are no significant differences between humans and animals that should allow us to take no interest in animals' well-being. Humans are a type of animal. There is much overlap between the abilities of humans and other animals. For example, the smartest gorilla is smarter than the least intelligent human.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: Koko the gorilla has [an IQ](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=127510&page=1) of between 75-95. In humans, 2.5% of the population [score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient) below 70.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.4. Con: Animals can and do interact meaningfully in humans' lives.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.4.1. Pro: Some people who consider a pet part of their family often value that pet's life over humans they've never met.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: In a philosophy [experiment](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/canine-corner/201308/is-dogs-life-worth-more-persons), 40% of people said they would save their pet, rather than a human foreigner, if both were equally likely to be hit and killed by a bus.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.4.2. Pro: Primates can use sign language to communicate with humans.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.2. Pro: Zoos empower [speciesist](https://www.scribd.com/document/33842289/Language-Power-Speciesism-Roger-Yates) discourse.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3. Con: Restricting the scope of moral consideration to members of one's own species is morally acceptable. \([Williams, p. 138-141](http://www.nyu.edu/classes/gmoran/WILLIAMS.pdf)\)
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.1. Pro: Even if, impartially speaking, there is no justification for discriminating against animals, we are not required to take the impartial perspective. We may simply take the [human perspective](http://www.nyu.edu/classes/gmoran/WILLIAMS.pdf), and from there it can be perfectly rational to discriminate against animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.1.1. Con: An integral part of humans and of society is to strive to be as moral as possible. We make the discrimination of animals unjust from our own perspective through the nature of our striving to be moral.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Most people believe that, for example, farming cows is not immoral. This indicates that our moral perspective does not consider killing animals to be wrong.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Most people only ever see the cow meat that ends up on their plate, but few ever witness the killing of a cow for the sake of meat consumption. We are sheltered from fully realizing what it means to take the life of an animal, and thus our moral perspective is skewed.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: It is true that most people do not viewing killing animals for food to be wrong. However, many people \([68-86% depending on the country](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5126776/)\) agree with the statement “farm animal welfare is an important consideration”. This means that the majority of people do view animal well-being as morally relevant.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Even philosophers like Kant, who [did not](http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=philosfacpub) consider animals to be inherently morally worthy, thought that cruelty to animals was wrong because it corrupted the humans who engaged in it.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Kant [believed that](http://www.csus.edu/indiv/g/gaskilld/ethics/animal%20rights.htm) a willingness to harm animals for one's own benefit would lead to the development of a willingness to treat other humans in similar ways.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.1.2. Con: Morality is, conceptually, a set of rules for everyone to follow. It thus inherently involves concepts of impartiality and universalisability, and excludes taking narrow, selfish perspectives.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Morality constantly permits us to take selfish, partial perspectives. We are morally justified in caring about or family members, our friends, and so forth. Similarly, we can be justified in caring about our own species.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.1.3. Con: We are not permitted to take whatever standpoint we want, without caring about impartial justification. For example, we cannot take the standpoint of our own race, and discriminate against other races.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.1.3.1. Con: There are no significant differences between races that can justify occupying a racial perspective. The same is not true for the differences between humans and animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.1.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.3.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.1.4. Pro: Morality itself is fundamentally [humanistic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-disability/#SpeBasAcc), and arises from human concepts. There is no need to extend the concept to other species.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.2. Con: We should not arbitrarily restrict our circle of concern to certain groups.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.2.1. Pro: Arguments that seek to justify restricting our concern to our own species could be extended to justify restricting concern to members of our own cultural, religious, or racial groups. This conclusion is clearly unacceptable.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.2.2. Pro: Our moral viewpoint has, over time, become more universal and cosmopolitan. We have rejected prejudices rooted in race, gender, culture, or religion. Prejudices rooted in species are the obvious next step.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Focusing political capital on improving animal rights would take away from other pressing issues in need of political capital, such as sexism and racism.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: The improvement of animal rights is as important an issue as improvement of other rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con: We can't solve any issues of rights discrimination effectively if our focus is scattered. Regardless of the importance of animal rights, our best chance to effectively improve them is by solving the other issues first.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.2.2.1.2. Con: Humans are capable of concentrating on multiple different injustices at the same time. There is absolutely no reason why promoting animal rights would detract from the promotion of other rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: This is particularly true when the injustices share no common stakeholders. In this case, there is no chance of people thinking that the two have the same goal.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.2.2.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.4. Pro: A creature's species is a morally irrelevant characteristic.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.4.1. Con: Just because a characteristic does not seem intrinsically morally relevant, does not mean it cannot become morally relevant if we imbue it with meaning.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: For example, someone's nationality is not intrinsically morally relevant. But we construct national identities, and because of these identities and interrelationships we owe greater moral duties to people who share our nationality. Similarly, we could construct a "species-identity" which excludes animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.2. Pro: If we only selectively gave these rights to humans, it would be very damaging to the loved ones of those denied rights to see them in that state. In that way it is better to grant them to all humans.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.2.1. Con: It is also emotionally stressful for non-human animals to see members of their social group suffer.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.3. Pro: Humans recognize their duties to other humans precisely due to the bond shared through species membership. Neither humans nor animals are naturally capable of recognizing duties towards one another. Even if it is morally right to extend duties to animals, duties can only exist if they are properly recognized from those that would exercise them.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.3.1. Con: Infants are similarly unable to recognise the existence of duties between them and other humans.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.4.3.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.6. Con: We owe duties to cognitively disabled humans and infants because they have special, morally important relationships to people in our society. Some animals \(like pets\) occupy similar positions, but other animals do not.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.6.1. Pro: This way of conceptualizing animal rights is attractive because it explains a puzzling asymmetry: why we tend to think that it is immoral, for example, to kill a domesticated dog, but not a cow.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.6.1.1. Con: This asymmetry is easily explained by the relative utility of these two deaths: cows provide food while dogs do not. If there were a market for dog meat and the dogs were killed ethically, this would presumably be as moral as killing cows.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.6.1.1.1. Con: Although people might find it ethical to kill dogs raised for food, most people would not think it is ethical to kill a domesticated pet dog with loving owners for food.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.6.1.1.2. Pro: [Cultural differences](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32965554) between the types of animals it is acceptable to kill reflect different utilities for animal consumption in different countries, not some underlying truth about which animals it is or it is not moral to eat.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.6.2. Con: These people have intrinsic value independent of their place in society, just like the rest of us. We need a theory of morality which explains why that is - and in order to be consistent, this would mean saying that many animals also have intrinsic value.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Animals have agency, interests, desires, and a capacity to suffer. This is sufficient to give them rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Rights are a very strong form of protection, which prevent us from harming someone even in order to accomplish a greater good. The mere possession of interests is not enough to grant a creature rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The idea of [equal consideration of interests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests) is a moral principle that all affected interests should be included and weighed equally when considering the rightness of an action, regardless of species-membership.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: This is a form of very strong impartiality that people's commonsense intuitions would reject.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: It is not perfectly acceptable for arbitrary, personal preferences to override animals' rights to have their interests considered. As long as granting animal interests consideration does not constitute significant harm upon human lives, it should be respected.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.2. Pro: Animals are clearly worthy of protections, but assigning rights to animals flies in the face of natural order. Should wolves have the right to kill deer? Or should they not have the right to kill deer?  The arguments fall apart when applied to reality.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.2.1. Con: We can create simple rules to resolve what seems like a complex problem:  All living things have a right to consume other living things in order to live. Humans and animals have a right to feed themselves.  At the same time, all living things have a right to live their lives in natural environments until death from sickness, injury, old age, or predation.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.3. Pro: Animals cannot have rights because they cannot exercise or defend their rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.5. Con: The idea that animals have rights goes back to the [18th century](https://philosophyintrocourse.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/machan-do-animals-have-rights.pdf).
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.6. Con: There is an [Universal Declaration of Animal Rights](https://constitutii.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/file-id-607.pdf) proclaimed in Paris on 15 October 1978 at the UNESCO headquarters. The text, revised by the international League of Animal Rights in 1989, was submitted to the UNESCO Director General in 1990 and made public the same year. This declaration was the first to propose a [new moral code](https://www.animallaw.info/sites/default/files/lralvol19_1_91.pdf) for humans which influenced the creation of some [treaties and conventions](http://www.stray-afp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Laws-and-declarations1.pdf) in Europe.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7. Pro: Animals are not party to the [social contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract).
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1. Con: The social contract is only a label we use to define the system of existing moral norms in society. Different social groups create and follow their own social contracts. This means that animals can be \(and in some ways may already be\) part of a social contract with humans.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.1. Pro: Humans relations with their pets are good examples of social contracts that emerge between human and animal.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.1.1. Con: Animals do not choose to become pets and part of a family. This situation cannot equate a social contract as one of the parties is not free, has not been afforded equal rights, or the option of consenting to the agreement.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Humans also do not agree to be born and enter the social contract, however it is assumed that we will all abide by it nonetheless.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Yet is not clear if animals are able to or will equally abide by the social contract.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Children cannot equally abide by the social contract, yet ensuring that they abide by it to a degree that is equal to their capability is sufficient. We should expect no more from animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: However, in most societies, at least an adult \(or the state\) takes care and is responsible for children, thus making them abide by the social contract until they are old enough to do it themselves. The same mechanism is not in place for animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.1.1.2. Con: Research has shown that wolves [domesticated themselves](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/06/the-origin-of-dogs/484976/) by staying close to human settlements. They arguably chose to develop into companions for humans, which is why dogs, whether pets or strays, generally like and actively seek human company.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Generally,[wolves](http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/gray_wolf/humans_pets.html) fear and avoid people. Those that [habituate](http://wolf.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Too-Close-for-Comfort.pdf) to humans do so not primarily by choice, but because they become conditioned to having easier access to food.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Wolves that become habituated begin to populate in human areas which can result in humans being attacked, wolves being hit by cars or killed by wildlife officials.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Animals will change their [behaviors](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179114001339) in response to artificial food sources and stay near these sources, even if they are not ideal areas for these animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.1.2. Con: Zoo animals are not pets, so it is not plausible to argue that we have obligations to them that flow from a social contract.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.1.2.1. Con: It is not implausible that the relationships that zoo keepers form with the animals are analogous to those that owners form with their pets.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.1.2.2. Con: There are many similarities between zoo animals and pets which make them analogous. In both cases, animals are confined to spaces that their human masters dictate, fed only when humans decide to feed them, and used for the social benefit we derive from interacting with them.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.2. Con: Animals are incapable of understanding notions of consent and agreement, which are essential to the ability to participate in any sort of contract.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.2.1. Con: Through training, animals are capable of learning the practicalities of these kinds of essential agreements, which is enough to participate in the social contract.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.2.1.1. Con: Even if an animal can learn to mechanically imitate agreement or consent, they will never truly understand the concepts in a morally meaningful way.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.2.1.2. Pro: The fact that we managed to domesticate wild animals like horses and dogs, proves the potential to teach animals to live side by side with humans.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.2.1.2.1. Con: The number of species humans have been able to totally or even partially [domesticate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_domesticated_animals) is [small](http://reducing-suffering.org/how-many-wild-animals-are-there/) compared to the total number of animal species on earth.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2. Con: The "social contract" is not a good theory of morality. It is therefore irrelevant what the social contract says about how we should treat animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.1. Pro: We are born into society, and most people don't have the capacity to leave society if they want; this means we never meaningfully consent to a "social contract."
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.1.1. Pro: The very idea of a "contract" involves the idea of mutual consent and agreement; if consent is not possible, the idea of a social contract becomes incoherent.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.1.1.1. Con: The social contract does not require literal consent, because a literal contract is not made. Rather, we imagine what would happen in a hypothetical ideal situation; we can imagine what animals, given their interests, would or would not consent to in a social contract situation.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The most famous example of social contract theory is John Rawls's [Veil of Ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance). None of us are capable of literally deliberating as if we were behind a veil of ignorance, but we can imagine what we would consent to, if we were behind a veil of ignorance. We can imagine similarly for animals and consent.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.4.3.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.2. Pro: Rights and moral duties exist independently of human civilization and society. If someone were alone on a desert island with a stranger, it would still be wrong to kill that stranger. So rights exist independently of, and therefore do not arise from, the social contract.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.2.1. Con: Two strangers on a desert island are no longer under the influence of societal ideals and norms. Unless they expect to reenter society at a later point, where they would be held accountable for their actions, they may deem it morally acceptable to kill each other over a fish, in order to survive.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.2.2. Con: A moral obligation is separate from a right. As an individual, if one has the power to feed a particular individual who otherwise could go hungry, they have a moral obligation to help that person. But that does not mean that that person has a right to demand and receive that person's help specifically \(even if there is a right to receive food, that does not mean there is necessarily a right to a specific person's food.\)
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.2.3. Con: Even if in a moral sense, rights and duties do not arise from a social construct, in a practical one, they do. Humans have the right to life, yet without a set of socially constructed rules and means to enforce them, that right, as in the mentioned example, cannot be guaranteed.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.2.3.1. Con: The "practical sense" of morality is irrelevant. If there existed a society where murder were legal, it would still be immoral to murder people in that society.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.2.4. Con: Even if only two people exist, the interactions between them are sufficiently morally meaningful to create moral obligations through a quasi-social contract. So even if morality only exists when it is socially constructed, moral duties would exist in this case.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.3. Con: Morality is just a useful institution that helps us regulate our society. There is no reason to extend that institution to animals, since we have nothing to gain from doing so.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.3.2. Con: Morality does not just consist of what is societally beneficial. There are many things which might make society better off, but are nevertheless immoral: for example, torturing criminals, or testing medicines on humans without their consent.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.4. Con: Rights are not merely based on morality. They are also based on the ability to enforce and express the right. In consideration is also the consequences for violating the supposed right. Rights are also sometimes about efficiency and about process.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.3. Con: Animals should be considered [party to the social contract](http://www.animalethics.org.uk/contractarianism.html), since they are conscious beings with desires and interests.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5. Pro: Reciprocity is a key reason we grant rights to others. Animals lack the capacity to reciprocate the duties humans show towards each other, and would show to animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.1. Con: There are animals, like [chimpanzees](https://phys.org/news/2012-11-anthropologist-reciprocity-chimpanzees-bonobos.html), who exhibit an understanding of reciprocity in their behaviour.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.1.1. Con: Perhaps it is true that we should not exhibit chimpanzees, or other higher-level primates, in zoos. But this does not imply that zoos should not exist.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.2. Con: Suppose someone was physically unable to commit murder. Even though that person would have not any duty to murder others \(such a duty would be meaningless since they are physically unable to commit murder\), others would still have a duty not to murder them. In this case, the duty to not commit murder does not depend on any reciprocity.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.2.1. Con: The duty to not murder is still maintained, as even the party who cannot murder has a duty to not murder.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.3. Con: Many of our moral duties don't involve reciprocity at all. For example, our duties to feed a person in desperate need aren't built on the idea that that person will reciprocate. This suggests that the ability to reciprocate is not a fundamental component of moral importance.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.3.1. Con: Our duty to feed a starving person or to care for an infant, does not come from the idea that these people will reciprocate immediately, but rather that they would if they could. A human can be reasonably expected to reciprocate duties when capable, animals cannot.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.3.1.1. Pro: We can trust humans to reciprocate duties when they are able because we can relate to them.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.3.1.2. Con: [Cats](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/why-do-cats-bring-home-dead-animals/) reciprocate. They hunt and kill prey and bring it to the humans that feed them.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.3.1.2.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.5. Con: There are many instances of non-reciprocal duties: for example, the duties of parents to their children, or the duties of humans to the environment.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.5.1. Con: Children are able to reciprocate on moral duties in general. They also inherit special moral obligations to their parents thanks to shared familial membership. So the duties of parents to their children are not non-reciprocal.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.5.1.1. Con: Even if a parent knew their child was unlikely to fulfill familial moral obligations \(care during old age\), they would still take care of their child.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: Parents do not abandon a child when they find the child is terminally ill.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.5.2. Con: We do not have inherent duties to the environment. We only have duties to protect the environment when environmental degradation would harm other humans, and in that case our duty is effectively to other humans, so it is not non-reciprocal.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.1. Con: All human duties are instrumental; the fact that our duties to the environment are instrumental does not count against them.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.2. Con: Humans generally value the environment for its own sake, so we have an instrumental duty to save the environment, based on those human desires.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.6. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.7. Pro: We give humans rights because we expect them to respect the rights of other individuals and the laws that lay the foundation for a civilized society. Animals are unable to comprehend the rules of society and the impact of their actions and so we cannot expect that they will respect others. This means that animals cannot be held accountable for their actions, unlike humans.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.7.1. Con: In practice we do hold animals accountable for their actions by [killing](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/07/an_alligator_ate_my_arm_should_we_kill_it_.html) them if they attack humans. In this way, we dissolve only one side of the social contract.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.7.2. Pro: Most animals are completely unable to control their instincts. An untrained animal could act erratically at any moment and attack or even kill a human, for any reason. There is no reason we should grant them considerations they won't offer us.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6. Con: A number of humans \(for example, children, or people who are so severely intellectually disabled that they are incapable of consenting to a contract\) are also not party to the social contract. We do not restrict their rights despite this.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.1. Pro: Many of these people have less of an intellectual capacity, or a capacity to participate in social frameworks or reciprocity, than many animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.2. Con: These people receive the benefits of socially constructed systems of rights because they are participants in social frameworks and inhabit close relationships with people who are capable of consenting to the social contract.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.2.1. Con: Even if a severely cognitively disabled person had no close relationships with anyone, it would still be immoral to harm that person. So their moral considerability does not depend on the close relationships they inhabit.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.2.2. Con: Pets are non-human animals which likewise inhabit close relationships with people who are capable of consenting to the social contract. By this reasoning, the social contract must be extended to pets.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.3. Con: These people are mostly non-threatening, meaning that their failure to uphold the social contract doesn't have devastating consequences.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.3.1. Con: The majority of animals are also non-threatening so this is not a sufficient justification.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.3.2. Con: Humans are sufficiently capable of giving animals rights and treating them well while making sure that they are not a threat to humans at the same time.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.4. Con: We do deny many of these people rights based on their capacity. People of diminished capacity may not, for example, be allowed freedom of movement or autonomy over things like medical decisions.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.4.1. Con: We institutionalise severely cognitively disabled people because we believe it is in their best interests. Keeping animals captive in zoos is not in the best interests of those animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.4.2. Con: Limiting freedom of movement or freedom of choice in medical decisions are done only when humans present a danger to themselves or others. Perhaps it would be fine to extend this same standard to non-human animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.4.3.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.4.4. Con: Even if we deny these people certain rights, they retain other rights despite their inability to participate in the social contract. This shows that rights do not flow exclusively from the social contract.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.5. Con: These examples are not analogous. We grant these humans rights on the assumption that they hypothetically might be able to uphold the contract in the future, which animals cannot.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.5.1. Con: We grant these rights to humans who we are sure will never be able to uphold the social contract \(example: mentally disabled and mentally ill persons\).
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.5.2. Con: There is no non-arbitrary reason why this assumption could not be extended to animals as well.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.7. Con: Animal rights are broadly accepted to exist to some extent. For example, most jurisdictions have legislation which restricts gratuitous cruelty to animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.7.1. Pro: The universality of these laws indicates a general willingness to accept that animals are to some degree morally important.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.7.2. Con: These laws restrict only gratuitous cruelty, not things like factory farming. This indicates that their purpose is not to grant animals rights, but to stop cruel human tendencies being developed through cruelty to animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.7.2.1. Con: Regulation of animal research exists in virtually all western countries, and reform of “[factory farming](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270183643_Animal_Rights_and_Human_Morality)” is regnant in Europe and rapidly emerging in the United States.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.7.3. Con: Animal rights can't exist simply because they're "broadly accepted."  There needs to be a universal and objective "rights giver" that decides who gets what rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.7.3.1. Con: There is no such universal and objective "rights giver" in human legal systems.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.7.3.1.1. Pro: You could claim that human rights are neither [natural nor universal](http://www.animalethics.org.uk/How-to-Do-Animal-Rights-2015.pdf); rights are only what people are willing to confer as they see fit on others, being the granting of particular benefits by people to people.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.7.4. Pro: Many cultures and countries recognise a responsibility for humans to reduce animal suffering where possible, and impose penalties on those who abuse animals both physically or through depriving them of basic requirements.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.7.4.1. Con: This represents an obligation on humans, not a right for animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.7.5. Con: Given the inconsistency between this and laws governing the production of meat, we should not view the existence of these laws as a sign that society respects animal rights; rather, we should see them simply as a societal expression of emotional sympathy to cute animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.7.6. Pro: Animals could be given rights similar to those of children \(ie: they are 'persons' but in recognition that their cognitive abilities are not equal to those of adult-humans, they do not have full legal rights, so their parents/owners are responsible for them by proxy\).
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.7.7. Con: In American Law, animals are property and not given rights. Cruelty to domestic animals is a violation on laws that constrain what you can do with your property. Illegal capture or hunting of wildlife is not based on animal rights, but based on a legal theory that wildlife is held in trust by the government \(usually the state\), and, therefore, is the government's property.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.7.8. Pro: Even the sharpest critics of [animal rights](https://philosophyintrocourse.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/machan-do-animals-have-rights.pdf) support the anticruelty laws and the simple moral judgment behind these laws is that animal suffering matters, and that this judgment supports a significant amount of reform. Therefore animals have rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.7.9. Con: Even if this is true, we don't recognise the most basic right: that to life. The mass slaughter of animals for human consumption is accepted as normal within society.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.8. Pro: Humans enjoy basic rights and liberties on different levels, from [UN Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) to national constitutions. Animals do not have these kinds of rights and protections.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.8.1. Con: Legal trends indicate that animals have rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.8.1.1. Pro: In 2008, a committee of Spain's national legislature became the first to vote for a resolution [to extend limited rights](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/weekinreview/13mcneil.html?_r=2&ref=science&oref=slogin) to non-human primates.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.8.1.1.1. Con: At best this indicates that some basic rights exist for some animals. It does not prove that animal rights exist in general.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.8.1.2. Pro: Acknowledgement of [animals as ‘sentient’](http://www.animal-law.biz/node/1269) was introduced to New Zealand’s Animal Welfare Act 1999 in August 2015.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.8.1.3. Pro: The [Lisbon Treaty](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/welfare_en) of the EU introduced the recognition that animals are sentient beings and deserve welfare.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.7.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.2. Con: The capacity animals have for suffering and enjoyment is no different from that of humans. Animals' inability to express their interests in order to achieve happiness and avoid suffering does not make those interests any less valid.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2. Con: A good zoo provides an enriched habitat in which the animals are never bored, are well cared-for, and have plenty of space.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.3.2.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2. Pro: Like with pets, zoo animals lead lives that are safer and of higher quality than if they had been left to fight for their survival in the wild.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1. Con: Zoo animals are likely to die prematurely.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Even if zoo animals die prematurely, they're likely to lead happier and more satisfying lives. In zoos they get to live free from fear of threats to their survival and they receive plenty of attention from zookeepers who work to ensure their happiness.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Zoos keeping animals can often be supportive and very much the opposite of degrading. The popular, prematurely born hippo [Fiona](http://cincinnatizoo.org/blog/2017/01/25/premature-hippo-baby-updates/), is a good example of a zoo animal that is confined and on display in a non-degrading environment that is instead very [nurturing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbqPF-fyCfo).
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Animals [suffer a great deal](https://foundational-research.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/) in the wild; it is therefore plausible that wild animals are better off in zoos.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: A sick or injured animal at a zoo will receive medical treatment. A sick or injured animal in the wild runs the risk of either being shunned by its pack as a liability or being hunted by predators as an easy target. An animal in the wild that is ill will likely die because of its ailment.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: A [very high percentage](https://foundational-research.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/) of animal infants born in the wild die in their first few days of life. This is not true in zoos.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Zoos sometimes [euthanize](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201208/zoothanasia-is-not-euthanasia-words-matter) unwanted offspring that do not meet their breeding plans.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Euthanasia is relatively painless. A death in the wild is not.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.2. Con: While negative for the individual, high infant death rate is part of the evolutionary process and allowing weaker infants to survive weakens the gene pool of that species.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Enabling weak infants to survive increases the gene pool in endangered species with few breeding individuals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.2.3. Pro: Animals in the wild suffer from cold, hunger, disease, and violent deaths from predators.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.2.3.1. Con: Wild animal deaths resulting from sickness, hunger, and predation, are all forms of [natural selection](https://imedea.uib-csic.es/bc/gep/docs/pdfsgrupo/articulos/2010/journal.pone.0009774.pdf), which provides the survival of the [best fit](https://ncse.com/files/pub/evolution/Evolution--Futuyma--chap11.pdf).
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: If we accept that it is right and proper for the powerful to dominate the powerless because that's how nature and evolution works, then the claim that zoos are bad because they cause animal suffering is negated.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.2.4. Con: However, forcing animals to sacrifice freedom for security is not our decision to make, nor can we evaluate if a wild animal would prefer some suffering and freedom or a peaceful life in an enclosure.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.2.4.1. Con: Most humans have little or no choice in laws that sacrifice freedom for the sake of security, such as with conscription.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: The Swedish government unexpectedly decided to reinstate [conscription](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39140100) recently.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.2.4.2. Con: Similarly, it is not for us to decide for animals that they would prefer freedom to safety and a peaceful life. We must make a choice, and should do our best to evaluate what the animal would want.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.3. Con: We do not know how to quantify animals' happiness. For all we know, they might for instance be much happier with brief and dangerous, yet unrestricted lives in the wild.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.2. Con: [84%](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep36361) of mammal species live longer in zoos than in the wild.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: There are studies which concluded animals have more longevity in the wild that in captivity, since euthanasia is made for population control, so even though there are some conditions in captivity that improves the longevity like veterinarian care, 84% is not a reliable statistics, because zoos also kills healthy animals which is a consequence of lacking space.

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.2.2. Con: Mice and hamsters seems to have more longevity in bigger cages, and similar lifespan in the wild, so zoos don´t provide better conditions that the natural habitat. This study says that the environmental enrichment do not eliminate problems related to behaviour anomalies.

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.4. Pro: The life expectancy of an African elephant is [three times longer](http://www.captiveanimals.org/news/2010/03/10-facts-about-zoos) in the wild than in captivity.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.5. Pro: For some captive animals, the small enclosures provided by zoos are directly related to the [infant mortality rate](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/01/science/zoos-are-too-small-for-some-species-biologists-report.html).

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.5.2. Pro: [Zoos](http://www.animalsandsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/preece.pdf) have failed to restore asian elephants population because in zoos their birth rates are low and calf mortality rates are high.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.6. Pro: Elephants in European zoos have about [half the median life span](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23655237_Compromised_Survivorship_in_Zoo_Elephants) of conspecifics in protected populations.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.7. Pro: It is common that healthy animals [get put down](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26356099) in zoos. In the 340 zoos that belong to the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, this number reaches an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 animals a year.

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.3. Pro: For animals that are lower on the food chain, zoos provide safety which is never guaranteed in the wild.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: In the wild, most animals have to fight for their survival, which may include fending off competition or having to flee when being hunted by more dangerous animals. Zoos keep animals protected from such dangers.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.3.2. Con: Some zoos just [kill their surplus](https://www.thoughtco.com/zoos-kill-animals-127659) animals outright.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.3.2.1. Con: This does not seem to be a requisite for zoos existing. Sacrifices can be reduced or eliminated without needing to prohibit zoos.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.3.2.2. Con: These animals would not exist without the zoo.  The efficiency of zoos at helping animals procreate should not be used against the zoos.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.3.2.3. Con: Most societies kill excess animals to control animal populations, usually for the good of the animals. Most societies kill excess stray dogs and cats to prevent them from starving or carrying disease. Most societies also use hunting or other game management to control the numbers of certain animals, because if they don't, they will likely die long, painful deaths.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.3.2.4. Con: This killing of individuals simulates the wild environment where too many of the same species in an area would cause a food shortage and cause many individuals to die from starvation or territory disputes. In this case, killing individuals to keep the population from reaching too many is the most humane thing \(since the alternative is a slow death by starvation\).
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.3.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.7.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.3.3. Con: There are some zoos that even [kill](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/09/marius-giraffe-killed-copenhagen-zoo-protests?CMP=share_btn_tw) animals in their "care", if they feel they are not good candidates for breeding.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.4. Pro: In the wild, animals often have to compete for scarce food sources. This is not a concern in captivity.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.4.1. Pro: In zoos, animals are guaranteed to have food every day. In the wild, getting food is dependent on the animal's hunting and gathering skills, as well as how accessible food is in their natural habitat.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.4.2. Con: The food types that animals would encounter in their natural habitats are not available in all countries. They may get food but it may not be the most appropriate for their species.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.5. Con: Animals in captivity are at risk of suffering from ['zoochosis](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/zoochosis-what-really-happens-to-animals-in-captivity-video/)', characterized by obsessive, repetitive behaviors like rocking, swaying and pacing.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.5.1. Con: Efforts can be made to make enclosures less stressful and more mentally stimulating for animals, improving their overall well-being.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.5.2. Pro: This self-destructive behavior [can occur under](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/animals-used-entertainment-factsheets/zoos-pitiful-prisons/) close confinement with other animals, due to a lack of privacy and little opportunity for mental stimulation or physical exercise.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.6. Con: We would not accept forcibly taking humans out of their natural environment for what was viewed as 'a superior environment'.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.6.1. Con: This is because humans have higher-order rights, such as autonomy. Animals lack the necessary intellectual and rational capacities to possess these rights.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.6.2. Con: Humans already live out of their natural environment, instead they live in cities that they view as 'a superior environment'.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.6.2.1. Con: Unlike animals, forced to live in man-made zoos, no one is forcing humans to live in man-made cities.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: In fact, humans themselves have developed cities as places to live in and therefore they are part of the 'natural' human environment. That is not true for animals and zoos, since animals have not created zoos.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Our ancestors built the cities. Newborns arrive in that environment without a choice about it. Only when they get older they have a choice whether to stay in the city or leave it.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Newborns live in a place their parents and ancestors have built \(cities\) and can then decide to leave or not. Animals born in zoos are not in a place their ancestors have built \(humans have\) and have no choice over staying or living. Both situations are hardly comparable.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.6.3. Con: Taking children away from abusive or neglectful parents is an example of taking humans away from their "natural environment" to a \(hopefully\) superior one, and that is usually accepted to be moral.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.6.4. Pro: For example, it would be wrong to take an individual living in poverty in the third world and place them in a cage in a zoo yet provide them with adequate food and medical treatment.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.6.5. Con: This happens all the time due to [forced migrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement), for which we have laws and international covenants that make it acceptable.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.6.5.1. Con: When forced migrations are legal, humans are moved [due](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement) to natural disasters, environmental crises or wars. That is not the case of animals removed from natural environments to be placed in zoos.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.6.5.2. Con: There are forms of forced migration that are not acceptable or legal.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.6.5.2.1. Pro: Sex trafficking and smuggling forces illegal human migration for the sake of exploitation. In the same way, zoo animals are coerced into captivity for the sake of human enjoyment.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.7. Con: Suffering in the wild is not caused by humans. By contrast, suffering in zoos is caused directly by us. As such, we should care more about the latter type of suffering.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.7.1. Con: It does not matter who causes the suffering. If by putting animals in zoos, they suffer less overall, the good we provide justifies the lesser harm that we cause.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.7.1.1. Pro: An act of saving someone's life by violently pushing them out of the way of a moving vehicle, justifies any non-lethal harm caused by the push or any selfish motivation the person may have had for pushing.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.7.1.2. Pro: When we donate money to charity we are not concerned with trying to figure out whose poverty we are 'responsible for' the most. We are just concerned with helping people as much as possible.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.8. Con: Even if the physical environment is better, many cages in zoos are not enclosed. Thus the animals have to deal with a climate which is foreign to them.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.9. Con: The animals have adapted and evolved to survive in certain environments. Forcing them to live outside of this \(regardless of whether it is superior or not\) can be harmful to them.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.11. Pro: Nature causes suffering to animals. Animals living in natural habitats are subject to predation, disease, starvation, competition, social isolation and aggression from conspecifics. To claim that zoos cause animals to suffer there needs to be evidence that their suffering is less outside of a zoo.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.12. Con: The concept that the strongest survive in the wild is not a theory nor should it be interfered with by humans or zoos.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.12.1. Con: This is [Darwin's Theory of Evolution](https://www.darwins-theory-of-evolution.com/). Its viewpoint is that by the process of 'natural selection', the strongest of a species will survive--evolving each generation as it progresses.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13. Con: Poor unhygienic atmosphere, malnutrition and cruel treatment of animals and other such negatives clearly outweigh the positives of chaining animals for the sake of 'protection' and human pleasure.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1. Pro: Some animals are subjected to physical abuse and neglect at zoos.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.1. Con: This is a reason to shut down these specific zoos that do not meet good standards of care, yet it does not justify a blanket ban of all zoos.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.2. Pro: Bad management can mean death to zoos animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.3. Pro: A lot of [roadside zoo's](https://www.peta.org/living/entertainment/deadly-destinations/) do little to nothing in terms of animal care and well being.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.3.1. Pro: Roadside zoo's like this one cause [psychological distress](https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/latest-news/article210462039.html) to animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.4. Pro: Last year, the Bowmanville Zoo in Ontario, Canada shut down after the [filmed beating](https://www.thedodo.com/bowmanville-tiger-whipping-zoo-closes-1878770250.html) of one of its tigers surfaced.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.4.1. Con: The fact that the zoo subsequently shut down indicates that animal abuse is adequately policed under the status quo.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.5. Pro: An [undercover investigation](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2015/01/ok-va-exotics-investigation-012215.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/) led by the Unites States Humane Society revealed footage of inhumane treatment of tiger cubs at two roadside zoos.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.6. Pro: Recently, a [live donkey was fed to tigers](http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/visitors-watch-in-horror-as-donkey-is-fed-to-tigers-alive-in-chinese-zoo/story-R41y6lRdvkWgM9QFiIhKgK.html) in front of visitors at a Chinese zoo.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.6.1. Con: Donkeys are domesticated animals. The zoo animals here - the animals whose rights we are concerned with if discussing whether to ban zoos - are the tigers. And this doesn't seem at all cruel to them.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.6.1.1. Con: Looks can be deceiving. In this case, it is cruel for the donkey, which also [belonged](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/06/wildlife-watch-china-donkey-tigers-zoo/?user.testname=none) to the zoo.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: How much domesticated an animal is, should not be a standard to justify mistreatment or harm. In Canada the codes of handling domestic animals defines [high standards](http://www.ctsanimals.ca/va1040/com/assets/data/pdf/introduction/intro4_10.pdf) for the basic principles of animal care and management. The purpose of these Codes are to promote the welfare of animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.6.1.2. Con: Since donkeys are [also used](http://www.rosamondgiffordzoo.org/assets/uploads/animals/pdf/MiniatureMediterraneanDonkey.pdf) in zoos, we should concern about donkeys as well.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Animals in [petting zoos](http://www.cochranehumane.ca/education/controversial_topics/attachments/2hsus-animals-in-entertainment.pdf) may range from the usual goats, sheep, llamas, and donkeys to exotic wildlife, such as wallabies and zebras.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.6.1.2.2. Pro: The majority of german zoos have a ‘[petting area](https://www.bornfree.org.uk/storage/media/content/files/Publications/GERMANY%20ENGLISH.pdf)’ with a variety of domestic species \(e.g. rabbits, alpacas, sheep, goats, donkeys, etc.\)
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.2. Pro: A study in the UK conducted in 2008 found welfare concerns for every elephant in all thirteen zoos studied  \([Harris et al., p. 47](http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=WC05007_7719_FRP.pdf)\).
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3. Pro: In static zoo enclosures, animals often become bored and restless with the lack of [natural stimulation](http://safe.org.nz/unnatural-environment) the wild provides.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1. Pro: Animals are often [prevented](https://www.reed.edu/biology/professors/srenn/pages/teaching/2008_syllabus/2008_readings/1_MorganTromborg2008.pdf) from doing most of the things that are [natural and important to them](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/animals-used-entertainment-factsheets/zoos-pitiful-prisons/), like running, roaming, flying, climbing, hunting, choosing a partner, and being with others of their own kind.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.1. Pro: To manage populations, zoos often use contraception measures, move young animals around or even euthanize unwanted offspring, thus depriving adult animals of any [parenting](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201208/zoothanasia-is-not-euthanasia-words-matter) experiences.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.1.1. Con: Accredited zoos do not breed - or even keep possible breeding pairs together - when the animals are not desired.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.2. Con: Zoos have staff dedicated entirely to making sure animals' habitats allow them to do the maximal amount of natural behaviors possible, and this includes social housing of species that live in social groups.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.2.1. Pro: The American Society of Primatologists [\(ASP\)](https://www.asp.org/welfare/socialhousing.cfm) has emphasized the importance of social grouping among captive primates. They help put in place guidelines and regulations for zoos to follow under the enforcement of the AZA.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.2.2. Pro: Zoos also, as part of their AZA accreditation, have to provide enrichment for the animals to help simulate natural behaviors.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.2.2.1. Con: Natural behaviors cannot be expressed optimally in an unnatural enclosure.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.5. Pro: All animals deserve the freedom to live their lives with their families in a natural environment.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.5.1. Con: This freedom is already taken away from them when we destroy their natural habitat in order to build our artificial habitats \(cities\). While zoos are not as good as a natural environment, they are still better than a concrete environment.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.6. Con: In zoos, animals are also prevented from getting eaten or starve to death, which is what kills the overwhelming majority of animals in the wild long before they get even halfway close to their biological lifespan. Animals don't have the same [Maslow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) hierarchical pyramid of needs as humans do, their most important goal in life is to survive.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.7. Pro: Animals belong to wildlife, not in cages.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.8. Con: There are and should be more [values](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Young15/publication/233569165_On_Comparing_the_Behaviour_of_Zoo_Housed_Animals_with_Wild_Conspecifics_as_a_Welfare_Indicator/links/00b495388fa21c9d1f000000/On-Comparing-the-Behaviour-of-Zoo-Housed-Animals-with-Wild-Conspecifics-as-a-Welfare-Indicator.pdf) to take into account \(longevity, proclivity to diseases, fitness, etc.\) when comparing wild animals and captive ones in order to asses their welfare.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.3. Pro: If standards for zoos increase then they can stay. If they can't maintain a proper environment, they should be shut down.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.3.1. Pro: Improving the standards of zoos can be a balanced approach to introduce new generations about the importance of animals in the ecosystem, whilst not troubling the animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.4. Pro: The idea of a zoo is good: teach people about animals and create a love and respect for their wellbeing in the world. But often execution is poor. Zoos definitely need to be reformed to be more conducive to the animals' natural habitats and way of life.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.5. Con: "No true Scotsman" is a logical fallacy.  One must address the real effects of actual Zoos, not defend "good zoos" alone.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.6. Con: However, there are plenty of zoos that keep animals in horrible [conditions](https://www.thedodo.com/the-5-worst-zoos-in-the-world--528392319.html).
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.6.2. Con: Zoos that violate the [code of ethics](https://www.aza.org/code-of-ethics) set forth for them by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums \(AZA\) can come under penalty, and be given time and resources to improve their conditions.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.6.2.1. Con: The AZA code is fairly [minimalistic](https://www.aza.org/code-of-ethics), banning only very egregious activities like selling animals at auctions. It is not sufficient to ensure truly ethical treatment of animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.6.2.2. Con: Only a minority of zoos is a member of these associations.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.2.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.7. Con: There are some animals for which it is impossible to build an enclosure large enough to replicate the wild and have "plenty of space".
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.7.1. Con: This only indicates that the animals zoos are allowed to host should be limited to the ones that they can provide sufficient habitats for.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.7.1.1. Con: Often, these animals \(large animals and predators\) are the types of animals that most attract people to zoos, so it would not be feasible to have zoos without these animals in them.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.7.1.1.1. Con: In 2005, the Detroit Zoo was the first major zoo in the US to decide on ethical grounds to [no longer keep elephants](https://www.thedodo.com/why-detroit-zoo-freed-elephants-1841038281.html) at all. The zoo has over [1.6 million visitors](https://detroitzoo.org/about/your-detroit-zoo/zoo-facts/) every year and has been one of the area's largest paid family attractions.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Elephants are one animal; if the zoo got rid of all its large predators, for example, it is unlikely that it would continue to be financially sustainable.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.7.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.7.3. Pro: The average enclosure for a polar bear is 1 million times [smaller](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2003/10/01/science/zoos-are-too-small-for-some-species-biologists-report.html?referer=https://www.google.com.au/) than the area they roam in the wild.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.7.4. Pro: Lions and tigers have on average [18,000 times less](http://www.captiveanimals.org/news/2010/03/10-facts-about-zoos) space in zoos than in the wild.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8. Con: Providing enriched, expansive habitats is incredibly expensive. Zoos cannot realistically get enough revenue to support these sorts of facilities.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.1. Con: The government could provide subsidies to zoos to create these facilities, instead of banning zoos altogether.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.1.1. Con: It may be immoral to devote large amounts of money to better the well-being of animals in zoos while some humans live in [poverty](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview). Therefore banning zoos and saving that money may be a better alternative for both humans and animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.2. Con: Zoos can build the revenue necessary to create better facilities through private tax-deductible donations, annual fundraisers and institutional donors. They do not have to rely on government funds alone.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.2.1. Con: Most zoos already try to get revenue through those means, and yet only some big zoos in large cities are able to get sufficient [revenue](https://smartasset.com/taxes/the-economics-of-zoos).
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.2.1.1. Pro: Many non-profit zoos have government subsidies and private donations and are still loss making. For example, the [Belfast](http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/renewed-call-for-loss-making-belfast-zoo-to-be-shut-down-1-7598161) Zoo, the [Toronto](http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2015/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-77493.pdf) Zoo or the Zoos [Victoria](https://www.zoo.org.au/sites/default/files/ZV_AnnualReport2016_v18.pdf).
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.3. Pro: The trend of mimicking an animal's natural environment has become so pervasive that [it now dictates](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-things-zoos-wont-tell-you-1306528026434) which and how many animals a zoo can afford.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.4. Pro: This may be especially true for [small](https://smartasset.com/taxes/the-economics-of-zoos) and rural zoos. Out of 458 non-profit zoos in the US, more than half of them are small operations with small budgets. They all report a total in revenues of $2.6 billion, yet the top 10% of zoos represent the 81% of that total.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.5. Con: Providing enriched, expansive habitats also provides more revenue opportunities for zoos. This is because these habitats make perfect grounds for conducting animal research and will attract more investors to fund these habitats.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.5.1. Con: Few zoos are actually creating enriched habitats because it is a costly investment that does not guarantee a sufficient return on investment.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.5.1.1. Pro: Only very large, economically strong zoos could afford to make such investments.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.5.1.1.1. Pro: Creating large enriched habitats would require the zoo to pay for things such as additional space requirements as well as design and construction of the habitat. All of this would cost a lot of time and money.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.5.1.1.2. Pro: Investing in enriched habitats requires gathering a large amount of capital at one time, and the capability to bear the risk that there is no return on the investment. Smaller zoos are unable to do either of these things.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.5.2. Pro: They are also likely to generate additional revenue by attracting a greater number of visitors to the zoo who are keen to see the animal in a more appropriate environment.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.5.2.1. Con: Most zoo visitors are ignorant about the "appropriate habitats" of animals, or simply do not care. This would not be a major draw.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.5.2.2. Pro: The experience of seeing animals in habitats that simulate their natural environment feels more realistic and exotic than habitats which do not.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.5.2.3. Pro: Living in an environment that is close to their natural habitat will likely make those animals act more happy and have more fun. Happy animals are more entertaining to watch than sad and bored animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.8.5.2.4. Con: More space for animals to roam makes it less likely that visitors will see the animal during their visit.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.3. Pro: Animals are conditioned to view humans as their superiors, causing [psychological suffering](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-dogs-go-heaven/201204/emotional-pain-in-animals-invisible-world-hurt).
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.4. Pro: Trapping animals, or any life in a cell, is akin to killing a person slowly. It is the worst and most lowly form of punishment. Only thing is, those arrested haven't committed any crime.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5. Pro: Zoos are [high-stress environments for animals](http://www.peta.org/about-peta/why-peta/zoos/), often leading to their becoming anxious and distressed.

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3. Pro: Zoos cannot replicate the natural environment of animals.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.1. Con: Zoos often work to create species-appropriate living conditions, such as for polar bears in [Munich](http://www.hellabrunn.de/en/news/beautiful-home-at-hellabrunn/our-polar-bears-between-tundra-and-rocks/history-of-the-polar-bear-enclosure/)'s zoo.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: The Detroit Zoo's '[Arctic Ring of Life](http://www.midwestguest.com/2009/01/detroits-arctic-ring-of-life.html)' exhibit is a state-of-the-art facility and one of North America's [largest](https://detroitzoo.org/animal-habitat/arctic-ring-of-life/) polar bear habitats.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.2. Con: Natural does not always mean better. Animals can adapt to new environments if they fulfill their needs. This can be seen with any invasive animal species.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.4. Pro: Zoos are, by their nature, restricted in the space they can provide their animals. For many animals, it is much more cramped than the wild.

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.5. Pro: Animals born in zoos are not capable of getting food by themselves. They are extremely dependent on their caregivers.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.6. Con: Many animals are born in captivity. For them, zoos are their natural environment.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.6.1. Pro: A great example of this is panda bears. They naturally have a difficult time reproducing in the wild, and thus their numbers have dwindled in the past century. Institutions in China have stabilized the declining numbers and there now are more pandas in captivity \(in more-or-less natural surroundings\) than exist in the wild, thus ensuring their medium-long term survival.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.6.1.1. Con: This is an effect of trying to breed pandas [in captivity](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2005/03/why_is_captive_breeding_so_hard.html), which has only become necessary because humans are destroying their natural habitat. Before, they had managed to survive for centuries without human support.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.4.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.6.2. Con: An animal's natural environment is determined by their biological characteristics - the environment that their species evolved in - rather than where they happened to be born.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.6.2.1. Con: There is also adaptation caused by the environment in which one is living, not only that caused by the one in which it evolved during thousands of years. A Persian cat is not so adapted to hunt as its ancestors were. A fat person from a modern country is adapted to their environment. Just in the same way, an animal bred in captivity is also adapted to its environment as well.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.7. Pro: Zoos can't fullfill the behavioral needs in complex animals, resulting in lack of animal welfare.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.8. Con: Zoos are making [efforts](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/01/science/zoos-are-too-small-for-some-species-biologists-report.html) to ensure animals can have their “complete behavioural repertoire” by considering important factors such as variety in diet, visual barriers \(so animals can hide\) and the relationship between animals and their caretakers.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.8.1. Con: Just because zoos are making efforts, it doesn't mean that zoo settings are completely like animals' natural habitats.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.8.

1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.10. Con: Without having controlled environments, there can be no guaranteed conservation. Many endangered species have native habitats that no longer exist in modern times.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.11. Con: Because artificial, captive environments are tightly supervised and controlled, it is the most effective way of preventing poaching from happening.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.12. Con: The issue is about how we define captivity and enclosure. We automatically see zoos as a collection of cages, but nature reserves are fenced and patrolled, so it could be argued that the animals are not truly free and able to live natural lives, even in that situation.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.13. Pro: More animals sanctuaries all over the world to help endangered species are necessary. Governments should give resources and help the ones that already exist and need support.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.14. Pro: Critically endangered species should be left to [breed in the wild](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277715328_Ark_or_park_the_need_to_predict_relative_effectiveness_of_ex_situ_and_in_situ_conservation_before_attempting_captive_breeding)
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.15. Pro: Nature does not need our impact. Nature needs space and respect without the touch of humans. Animals are doing perfectly fine as long as we don't pollute or destroy their homes.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.16. Pro: For example, national parks play critical roles in conservation.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.16.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1.2.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.16.2. Con: Poaching can still devastate endangered populations even in national parks. By keeping animals in other areas, we maintain a chance of saving the species for future generations as well.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.16.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.1.4.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.17. Con: Efforts to conserve animals in the wild often require the cooperation of governments. However, in many places where animals are critically endangered, governments are either unwilling or unable to cooperate.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.17.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.17.2. Pro: For example, African nations have [struggled](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2014-02-05/africa-s-anti-poaching-problem) to protect animals from the threat of poaching.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.3. Con: The primary right of animals is their right for species and environments to be preserved. Individual animal rights are meaningless \(e.g. mass killing of invasive species to preserve the original environment health\).
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.4. Pro: Allowing people to visit zoos reinforces the idea that is it OK to use animals for entertainment.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.5. Con: That humans do not have a right to breed, capture and confine other animals has not been shown.
1.1.5.3.7.1.4.5.1. Pro: Humans have self-appointed themselves with the right to breed, capture and confine animals, endangered or not. That is the case for zoo animals as well as farms animals and pets.
1.1.5.3.7.1.5. Con: Unless zoos breed endangered animals to return them to the wild, just keeping them and not allowing them to be in their natural habitats is abusive.
1.1.5.3.7.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.5.2. Pro: Only 16 of 145 [reintroduction](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/19/science/as-rescue-plan-for-threatened-species-breeding-programs-falter.html) programs around the world managed to successfully reintroduce animals into the wild.
1.1.5.3.7.1.5.2.1. Pro: Of those, zoos participated with other institutions in 129 reintroductions, totalling a rather [low](http://www.iberlinx.com/eng/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=61:the-role-of-zoos-in-the-reintroduction-of-animals-myth-or-reality&catid=6:artigo&Itemid=9) number of animals compared to vast amount held in captivity.
1.1.5.3.7.1.5.3. Pro: Reintegration of an endangered animal back into their natural habitat can be difficult when the reason for their endangerment is the destruction of their home due to human factors or environmental issues.
1.1.5.3.7.1.5.4. Con: Many animals that are not endangered have other complications that prevent them from living in their natural habitat. For example, there are a couple of bald eagles at my local zoo, because their wings are damaged and they would die if returned to the wild.
1.1.5.3.7.1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.7. Con: "Conservation" is not the mere existence of live creatures - but the preservation of their ecosystem.  Without this system, biological life exists but it is thrust into an environment that only mimics the real world.
1.1.5.3.7.1.8. Con: Conservation can be achieved by limiting human interference with the natural world.
1.1.5.3.7.1.8.1. Con: We cannot limit other humans interference with the natural world. To ban zoos is to limit all conservation options before we have even moved in the direction of change. It would be unsafe to just stick animals in harsh environments and see what happens. It is too great a task to make the entire world change, especially when very few may be moving in that direction.
1.1.5.3.7.1.8.2. Pro: [Protected areas](http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p312491/pdf/CHAPTER6.pdf) are one of the most effective tools for slowing the rate of biodiversity loss and many species continue to survive only because of the protection provided by national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas.
1.1.5.3.7.1.8.3. Pro: No-take [zones](https://www.iucn.org/downloads/marine_protected_areas_lundy.pdf) increase the abundance and average size of fish species.
1.1.5.3.7.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.2.2.
1.1.5.3.7.1.10. Pro: Until and unless all lost natural habitat space is replenished, zoos are the best way to perpetuate species at risk.
1.1.5.3.7.1.11. Con: Zoos frame conservation and animal welfare in a profitability framework, whereas conservation should be focused on eco-sustainability and biodiversity.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12. Pro: Zoos contribute financially to conservation, both at their facilities and in wild habitats.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.4.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12.2. Pro: The [Zoological Society of London](https://www.zsl.org/about-us/landmarks-in-zsl-history) has achieved much for the conservation of endangered animals, with their work including deploying camera traps to catch poachers and assisting the rescuing of 950 exotic fish and coral.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12.3. Pro: In 2008, World Association of Zoos and Aquariums \(WAZA\) estimated that zoos spent [£230 million](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/dec/08/zoos-aquariums-conservation-animals-wildlife-funding) on conservation efforts every year. This includes spending both within the zoo and on external environments.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12.3.1. Con: Those figures are mainly based on the efforts of some forward-thinking and powerful institutions. For example, in the US, [75%](https://news.mongabay.com/2014/05/the-quiet-zoo-revolution/) of the conservation funding was provided only by 14 zoos.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12.3.1.1. Pro: Zoos [rarely participate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233548151_The_Public_Face_of_Zoos_Images_of_Entertainment_Education_and_Conservation) in habitat and/or species restoration projects or provide funding for conservation efforts in the natural environment.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12.3.1.2. Con: Even if small zoos do not have a big impact financially, they play a key role in small and [lesser-known](https://news.mongabay.com/2014/05/the-quiet-zoo-revolution/) conservation projects.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12.4. Pro: Zoos often [sponsor or advertise](https://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/28/zoos-raise-money-for-faraway-animals/) conservation efforts \(e.g. Adopt-an-Animal campaigns\) that their patrons can participate in.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12.4.1. Pro: By doing so, zoos are expanding their reach in conservation efforts by bringing more public awareness to lesser-known organizations.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12.5. Pro: Zoos are an important source of [conservation funding.](https://www.aza.org/cgf) Without them, conservation groups, which already lack funding, will lose funding. This, in turn, could lead to a degradation of habitat, instead of preservation.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.12.3.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12.5.3. Con: A lot of zoos aid with the conservation of animals such as Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Basel Zoo in Switzerland and the Singapore Zoo in Singapore. However, not all zoos around the world are held to these high standards. Many zoos in \(generally\) second and third world countries do not take care of their animals and abuse them, with no contribution to conservation efforts at all. They just want to make money and do not care about the animals wellbeing.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12.5.4. Pro: A lot of zoos aid with the conservation of animals such as Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Basel Zoo in Switzerland and the Singapore Zoo in Singapore. However, not all zoos around the world are held to these high standards. Many zoos in \(generally\) second and third world countries do not take care of their animals and abuse them, with no contribution to conservation efforts at all. They just want to make money and do not care about the animals wellbeing.
1.1.5.3.7.1.12.6. Pro: Conservation is difficult to fund. Not only do zoos fund the conservation projects, but they spread awareness about the animals and the need for [conservation](https://taronga.org.au/news/2017-05-22/10-endangered-species-saved-extinction-zoos). A lot of conservation projects rely on the awareness raised through zoos to continue their work.
1.1.5.3.7.1.13. Con: Zoos perpetuate the caging of wild animals regardless of their conservation status. We must accept that zoos are for our entertainment \(with an element of education\) and we either condone caging animals for entertainment or not.
1.1.5.3.7.1.14. Con: Local populations, scientific research, politics and laws, play a more critical role in [conservation](https://environment.yale.edu/publication-series/documents/downloads/a-g/gemmill.pdf) of [endangered](http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/G01070.pdf) [species](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3152/147154604781765798), making the impact of zoos on conservation less impactful.
1.1.5.3.7.1.15. Con: Zoos have failed to restore [panamanian golden frog](http://unlesscontest.phillyzoo.org/uploads/8/3/0/3/83032482/panamanian_golden_frogs.pdf) populations.
1.1.5.3.7.1.15.1. Pro: [Increased mortality](http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1638/2016-0250.1?journalCode=zamd) in zoos of the panamanian golden frog occurred during the breeding season.
1.1.5.3.7.1.16. Pro: Zoos also make efforts to breed endangered species and [reintroduce](https://www.aza.org/reintroduction-programs) them into the wild.
1.1.5.3.7.1.16.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.5.2.
1.1.5.3.7.1.16.2. Con: Most animals in zoos come from a [captive](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/top-misleading-claims-zoos-make/) lineage and thus reintroduction is often [unsuccessful](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/01/080123-carnivores-wild_2.html).
1.1.5.3.7.1.16.2.1. Pro: [Captive breeding](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/captive-bred-animals-are-just-not-that-into-their-wild-counterparts/) often puts its captive species at an evolutionary disadvantage because they often fail to inherit the survival behaviors and tactics necessary to live successfully in the wild.
1.1.5.3.7.1.16.3. Pro: Zoos are invaluable at breeding healthy new animals that are endangered. The San Diego Zoo, for example, is developing cutting edge reproductive technologies to rescue the [Northern White Rhino](http://institute.sandiegozoo.org/species/white-rhino) from the brink of extinction.
1.1.5.3.7.1.16.4. Con: Many endangered species are endangered because their natural habitat has been destroyed, so there is often no wild to reintroduce them to.
1.1.5.3.7.1.16.5. Pro: Zoos prevent or reduce the chances of animals of going extinct as they did with the [California Condor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_condor).
1.1.5.3.7.1.16.5.1. Pro: After the loss of many wild condors, the US government captured all the remaining ones in 1987 \(with a total population of 27 individuals\) and they were bred in captivity in San Diego and Los Angeles zoos to be then [reintroduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_condor) into the wild in 1991.
1.1.5.3.7.1.16.6. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.17. Con: Zoos do not provide many of the benefits of conservation.
1.1.5.3.7.1.17.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.1.3.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.17.2. Pro: Conservation should be predicated on animals thriving in the wild. Zoos do not enable this.

1.1.5.3.7.1.19. Pro: A number of animals cannot survive in the wild. Zoos provide a means for their survival.
1.1.5.3.7.1.19.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.6.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.19.2. Pro: There are several species that [would be extinct](http://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/8-zoos-helping-animals-edge-out-of-extinction) without the preservation of zoos, for example the Arabian Oryx, the Golden Lion Tamarin, and the Puerto Rican Parrot.
1.1.5.3.7.1.19.3. Con: Preserving animals for preservation's sake [is not desirable](http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/jamieson01.htm). We should not preserve animals that are not able to survive in nature any more, but only in man-made constructions. In this case, we keep the animals for ourselves and for preserving their genetic material, not for the animal.
1.1.5.3.7.1.19.3.1. Con: Not all animals that are in conservation programs in zoos cannot live in the wild anymore. Frequently, animals are [reintroduced back into the wild](http://www.waza.org/en/site/conservation/conservation-breeding-programmes/extinct-in-the-wild) after human care or conservation breeding programs.

1.1.5.3.7.1.19.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.16.2.
1.1.5.3.7.1.19.3.2. Pro: The process of closing a zoo is progressive. In these cases, animals unable to survive can be taken care for by the zoo during this process like the case of [Sandra](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/buenos-aires-zoo-close-animals-captivity-argentina) the orangutan.
1.1.5.3.7.1.19.3.2.1. Pro: Because she is a hybrid of two orangutan sub-species she wouldn't socialise if released into the wild.
1.1.5.3.7.1.19.4. Con: A significant number of species are only threatened by extinction because of the way [humanity has treated the environment](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/19/humans-creating-sixth-great-extinction-of-animal-species-say-scientists). Ceasing this destructive behaviour would be a much more method of conservation.
1.1.5.3.7.1.19.4.1. Con: While that scenario is preferable, it is unlikely to happen in time to save the many endangered species that reside in zoos.
1.1.5.3.7.1.19.5. Pro: If we abolished zoos we would have to set the animals free and allow them to become extinct completely.
1.1.5.3.7.1.19.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.1.7.1.
1.1.5.3.7.1.19.6. Pro: According to some authors, Earth is entering the [6th mass extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Extinction:_An_Unnatural_History), and therefore zoos are a cornerstone in many conservation efforts for the most endangered species on our planet.
1.1.5.3.7.1.19.7. Pro: Zoo's provide a last line of defence against extinction. We obviously can't protect wild habitats at the moment so zoos hold the genetic potential for a time in the future when habitats are returned to the wild.

1.1.5.3.7.1.19.8. Pro: Conservation of animals also benefits humans as biodiversity allows us to create more effective medicines.
1.1.5.3.7.1.19.8.1. Pro: Incredibly powerful pain killers have been found in the [shells](http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/cone-snail-pain-killers-could-be-100-times-effective-morphine/) of cone snails.
1.1.5.3.8. Con: Zoos [perpetuate colonial narratives](http://theconversation.com/is-it-time-to-break-with-colonial-legacy-of-zoos-60485).
1.1.5.3.8.1. Pro: Zoos symbolise human superiority over animals, which can then easily be applied over humans themselves, encouraging the idea of slavery.
1.1.5.3.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.3.6.1.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2. Pro: Zoos are the direct proof that humans think their species is superior.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.1. Pro: The only thing people learn in zoos is that humans give themselves the right to imprison animals. Therefore, humans are selective in which forms of life are superior to others and thus humans will always be selective in what kind of people are superior to others.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.4.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.1.2. Con: Many larger zoos have specific areas dedicated to education of young children via interactive \(not necessarily live animal\) exhibits, or through child friendly talks from research and care staff in the zoo. These talks often emphasize animal respect and well-being
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2. Con: Humans actually are superior to animals.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.1. Con: The eagle eye has an eyesight estimated at 4 to 8 times [stronger](https://d253pvgap36xx8.cloudfront.net/formsbuilder/files/52a8c912b44511e79e900242ac110002/CubeSat_Challenge_-_QEBELS_Network_entry.pdf) than that of the average human.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.2. Con: Dogs have a superior [olfactory sense](https://stud.epsilon.slu.se/6341/7/blom_m_140108.pdf) to humans. In general they can detect small amounts of determined odour and faster.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Dogs were created by humans selectively [breeding](https://slate.com/technology/2005/12/our-creepiest-genetic-invention-the-dog.html) wolves.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: A wolf’s sense of smell is also [far greater](https://ukwct.org.uk/files/education/Communication.pdf) than humans’ with approximately 200 million olfactory cells housed in the nose.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.2.2. Con: Most dogs are literally owned by humans as property.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.2.2.1. Con: In Portugal the [ownership](https://ddd.uab.cat/pub/da/da_a2017v8n2/da_a2017v8n2a2.pdf) of pets is expressly subject to a number of limitations that regards their animal rights. They have a legal status that expressly recognize them as living beings endowed with sensibility, which makes them non-objects.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.3. Con: Clupeiform fishes, like shad fish have [ultrasound perception](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11915735_Ultrasound_detection_by_Clupeiform_fishes).
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.4. Con: The mostly deadly living being to humans are plasmodiums, that comes from mosquitos. According to the [World Health Organization](http://www.hardydiagnostics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Most-Deadly-Animals.pdf), mosquito bites result in the deaths in more than 1 million people every year with malaria infections.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.4.1. Con: This is due to humans' choice not to be deadly to humans; on the individual level and the collective level, humans choosing otherwise would be more deadly than any nonhuman species.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.4.1.1. Pro: Collectively, humans can - and might - cause a nuclear war. Humanity might survive the ensuing winter, but this is much less likely if we imagine the belligerents are actively trying to cause human extinction.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.4.1.1.1. Con: Cockroaches have a much higher [radiation resistance](https://www.abctlc.com/downloads/courses/CockroachControl.pdf) than vertebrates, with the lethal dose perhaps 6 to 15 times than for humans. Other insects like the fruit fly have even more radiation resistance than cockroaches
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.4.1.2. Con: A [super-virus](http://www.academicjournals.org/app/webroot/article/article1380108064_Jafri%20et%20al.pdf) can be more deadly to humans than humans. It can spread from human to human very easily, through coughing, sneezing, touching nose, mouth, or contaminated surfaces.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.5. Con: [Viruses](https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article/89/3/495/2680416) are above us in the food web even when they´re not from the animal kingdom. Viruses dominate in numerical abundance and genetic diversity.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.6. Con: Humans don't have a specific UV receptor like [bees](https://gardenecology.pdx.edu/sites/default/files/2017-09/8%20Bee%20Perception%20Lab-8.pdf).
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.6.1. Con: Bees are often literally owned by humans as property.
1.1.5.3.8.1.2.2.6.1.1. Con: The vast majority of pollinators are [wild](http://www.fao.org/3/I9527EN/i9527en.PDF). Pollinators are under threat and the number of bees all over the world is [declining](https://www.greenpeace.org/switzerland/Global/international/publications/agriculture/2013/BeesInDecline.pdf), yet in the 43-year history of the Endangered Species Act, not a single species had been granted protection, despite a huge decline in wild bee populations. [7 species](http://climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CI-bees-final.pdf) of bees are currently listed as endangered species.
1.1.5.3.8.1.3. Con: It's no easier to apply the concept of human superiority over animals to select groups of humans and justify oppression, than it is to apply the concept of humans being no better than animals to select groups of humans, and justify oppression that way.
1.1.5.3.8.2. Con: Many, if not most, Western institutions carry the legacy of colonialism. This is not a reason to ban them outright.
1.1.5.3.8.2.1. Pro: Police departments [developed](http://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/brief-history-slavery-and-origins-american-policing) out of slave patrols.
1.1.5.3.8.3. Pro: Zoos seem like a relic of a Cartesian mode of thinking - they're steeped in the idea that animals are worth less than us and can exploited for entertainment. This is more damaging to animal welfare in the greater scheme of things.
1.1.5.3.8.4. Pro: Historically, [zoos displayed captive humans alongside flora and fauna](http://www.globalresearch.ca/europes-forgotten-history-from-human-zoos-to-human-trophies-displayed-in-colonial-museums/5469488). Even though this practice was stopped long ago, it maintains a problematic legacy.
1.1.5.3.8.4.1. Con: Many socially acceptable things have problematic histories, but progress comes from removing bad practices rather than prohibiting the entire thing, e.g. we now prohibit involuntary medical experiments on humans but not all medical experiments altogether.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2. Pro: If displaying [humans](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16295827) has stopped as a practice as it is degrading, there is no reason why animals cannot be given the same treatment.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.1. Con: Human and animal psychology are not identical. Assuming so can present harmful situations for many species of animal.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.1.1. Con: Few species of animals thrive in captivity, most degrade and cannot behave naturally. Even if humans have different psychological processes than solitary species, confinement and captivity have never been shown to be positive environments.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2. Pro: Keeping wild animals confined and on display is degrading.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2. Pro: Two of the biggest figures within animal rights advocacy, [Peter Singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer) and [Tom Regan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Regan), have presented numerous convincing and rational reasons why animals deserve the same rights and dignity as humans.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: Philosopher Peter Singer explains how the only morally consistent principle of equality lies in the idea of [equal consideration of interests](http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1979----.htm). If this is accepted, there is no morally justifiable reason to treat animal life as less valuable than humans.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: If we measure the meaning of interests such as pain and happiness of sentient beings on the basis of how intelligent the being is, then logically we should consider the interests of less intelligent people as worth less.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.1.2. Con: The gap between more intelligent and less intelligent humans is [far less](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1955772/) than the gap between any human and the majority of animals.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: The capacity animals have for suffering and enjoyment is no different from that of humans. Animals' inability to express their interests in order to achieve happiness and avoid suffering does not make those interests any less valid.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3. Con: A human life is worth more than the life of an animal.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: Humans have better skills and capabilities, thus their lives are worth more.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Humans are the kings of the animal kingdom, they have mastered and beaten all other animals using weapons, traps and intellect and are thus worth more than all the other animals.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The US is by far the most militarily powerful nation in the world. This does not imply that Americans are more morally worthy than people of other nationalities.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: Humanity has created culture, art and science.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Humans are not uniquely capable of creating culture, art or science.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Non-human primates have developed [tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate#Tool_use_and_manufacture) for various purposes including gathering and hunting. This proves that they are capable of performing scientific discoveries for their society.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: There are non-human primates which have created both [social culture](http://www.biolinguagem.com/imagens/bioimagens/Sapolsky,%202006%20-%20Social%20cultures%20among%20primates.pdf) and [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Art_by_primates).
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.1.3. Con: It is not clear why skill in tasks that humans value should determine the worth of a life. Historically, there were times when European civilizations were far more technologically advanced than some other areas of the world. This would not have implied the superiority of European lives.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.2. Con: Animal life does not have to be considered as equally important to human life in order for them to deserve to be treated well by humans.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: Going to zoos is an unnecessary luxury. Humans can enjoy themselves in many ways without making animals suffer or taking their freedom away.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3. Pro: Generally speaking, in all societies, humans treat a human's life as more important than that of an animal.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3.1. Pro: Taking the life of an animal has fewer consequences than taking the life of a human.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3.2. Con: At the very least, this is not universally true. International and sustained outrage over the shooting - and death - of a [gorilla](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/09/harambe-the-perfect-meme/498743/) whose actions were threatening the safety of a toddler who had fallen into his enclosure indicates that in some cases, humans will actually value animal lives over those of other humans.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: The mother of the toddler experienced numerous social [insults and blame](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/05/31/zoos-arent-your-baby-sitter-parenting-critics-flay-mom-after-gorilla-shot-to-protect-her-toddler/?utm_term=.2e724c0d555e) for the shooting death of the gorilla. Some harassers remarked that the gorilla's life was more important than the life of her child.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3.2.2. Con: This does not prove that the gorilla's life was worth more than the baby's; instead, this merely shows that killing the gorilla was wrong, perhaps because there was only a low risk of the child being killed.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3.3. Con: How humans do value lives does not necessarily indicate how humans should value lives.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3.4. Con: Pets in high income countries mostly have more secure lives than most humans around the world.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3.4.1. Con: The love for a pet is an individual factor when considering caring about animals vs humans. It is not a societal norm.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3.4.2. Con: Even pets of in high income countries are slaves to their owners.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3.4.3. Con: In the US alone pet owners euthanize [2.7 million](http://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics) animals per year.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.2.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3.6. Pro: Humans accept most livestock being treated in an abominable fashion, before being slaughtered.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3.7. Con: Most people who donate to wildlife organisations do not treat human lives as being more important than lives of animals.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3.8. Pro: Humans enjoy basic rights and liberties as guaranteed by a wide range of domestic and international institutions. Animals do not have these kinds of rights and protections.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3.9. Pro: It is only in war situations that a human life is considered expendable for a cause. Otherwise the utmost is done to protect human members of society.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.4. Pro: Human life has a higher value because humans need and depend on each other, socially and economically.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.4.1. Pro: Humans, as members of the same species, can identify with each other, feel what it is like to be in the situation of the other individual and thus develop a stronger feeling of compassion and sympathy than with animals.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.4.1.1. Con: Humans, through history, have consistently subjugated and killed other groups of humans by constructing them as "inferior" and "other" based on random ideas, and often for personal gain. Enslaved people have often been valued less than animals.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.4.2. Con: This may make us appreciate other humans more than we do animals, but does not mean that animal lives do not have value - to themselves, to other animals, and to the world.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.4.3. Con: Economic or social dependence is not the source of moral duty. We have no economic or social dependence on distant strangers or foreigners. This does not mean that have no moral duties towards them.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.4.4. Con: Animals are also responsible for important social tasks, e.g. guide dogs or [therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal-assisted_therapy) animals. Humans depend on animals for these functions.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.4.5. Pro: Appreciation and commendation, which is very important to humans' self-perception, can only be given by other humans.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.4.5.1. Con: Animals may not be able to verbalize commendation, but they are clearly capable of giving affection and unconditional regard. Both of these help with self-perception and well-being.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.4.6. Pro: In classical [Greek philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nature), humans are described as social or political animals, with an innate propensity to develop more complex communities the size of a city or town, with a division of labor and law-making. Humans need these communities to develop their [full potential](http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-pol/#SH7c).
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.4. Con: We are relieved of the responsibility to give animals the same rights as humans because humans consciously agree to act civilly while animals do not.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.4.1. Pro: We give humans rights because we expect them to respect the rights of other individuals and the laws that lay the foundation for a civilized society. Animals are unable to comprehend the rules of society and the impact of their actions and so we cannot expect that they will respect others. This means that animals cannot be held accountable for their actions, unlike humans.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: When humans do not abide by their responsibility to act civilly and follow laws, we strip them of their rights through means such as imprisonment, in order for civilized society to function.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.4.1.2. Pro: People restrict themselves because they understand the impact of their own actions. Because animals cannot understand the meaning of the harm caused or the consequences of committing an act such as murder or assault, their actions are not restricted by that knowledge.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.4.1.3. Con: There are [many instances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals) where we give the right to protection from needless suffering to animals. This is because we recognize that it is immoral to cause unnecessary suffering to creatures regardless of whether or not we expect a creature to act civilly.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.4.2. Con: This cannot be the metric by which we grant humans rights. If it were, then we would remove all rights from those who broke that agreement \(by committing crimes\); however in practice we respect innate rights.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.4.2.1. Con: To some extent we do remove rights from those that break this agreement. For example, those who commit a large felony are stripped of their freedom by being sent to prison. This means that to some extent, we do grant rights on the basis of this agreement.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.4.3. Con: Many humans, who do not consciously agree to act civilly, have rights; for example, people in comas, or the severely cognitively disabled.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.6.2.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.3.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.6. Con: The equal consideration of interests has implausible implications. It suggests, for example, that it is unjustifiable to care disproportionately more about our family members than about strangers.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.6.1. Con: We have no justification for privileging our own interests, or the interests of people related to us, over other interests; doing so is merely a form of selfish egoism.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.7. Pro: Even if not all interests have to be weighed precisely equally, the interests of animals are violated so severely by zoos, and the interests of humans advanced in such a minor way, that zoos are clearly immoral.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.7.1. Pro: Zoos take away an important part of animals' lives by taking their freedom. It is in the interest of animals to have freedom and they deserve to be free.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.8. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.1.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.10. Pro: [Phillosophers](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-animal/) have argued that while humans are different in a variety of ways from each other and other animals, these differences do not provide a philosophical defense for denying non-human animals moral consideration.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.2. Pro: Respecting the interests of animals equally implies respecting the interests of animals in retaining their dignity.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Even if we respect the interests of animals equally, they may simply have different interests; there is no reason to impose human-centric interests like dignity onto animals.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.3. Con: Despite those arguments, [courts](https://nypost.com/2015/07/30/chimps-are-not-people-judge-rules-in-animal-rights-case/) have ruled against animals having the same rights and being considered equally to humans.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3. Pro: Going to zoos involves ignoring, or trying not to think about, the knowledge that the zoo causes its animals significant suffering. This sort of willful ignorance is morally degrading.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.1. Pro: Major media outlets have [covered](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2017/07/18/these-haunting-animal-photos-aim-to-make-you-reconsider-a-visit-to-the-zoo/?utm_term=.3b91afd66601) animal suffering in zoos as well as documented instances of [abuse](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4625730/Chinese-zoo-denies-mistreatment-bear.html) and neglect. Therefore, zoos' inadequacy regarding animal well-being has been part of the public domain and if it is ignored, it is willingly so.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.2. Pro: Many countries have decided to ban the use of animals in [circuses](http://www.peta.org.uk/blog/these-17-countries-banned-wild-animal-circuses/). Aside from animal well-being, more and more people argue that it is questionable to enjoy watching “miserable and confused” animals doing tricks they have been forced to learn, sometimes through abuse.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.2.1. Con: Animals in zoos are not usually trained to do tricks, and when they are in contemporary zoos, it is done through a reward based system as an enrichment exercise.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: Trainers [reinforce](https://seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-infobooks/animal-training/animal-training-philosophy) desirable behavior with a variety of rewards, and do not draw attention to undesirable behavior.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.2.1.2. Pro: Reward-based clicker training is often used [in conjunction with an educational talk](https://youtu.be/isGbC2MuXvE?t=58s)about and animal. The clicker trains animals to execute behaviors on cue that will be discussed in the talk. An animal might be trained to turn in a circle to allow the audience a view of their coat coloring while the trainer talks about how this coloring is an adaptation. Or the animal might be trained to execute a natural behavior on cue, so the audience gets a chance to see this behavior.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.3. Con: People who can afford to attend zoos already commit this sort of willful ignorance on a daily basis in many other ways.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.3.1. Pro: Most people who can, already spend a lot of money on unethical products like ['blood phones'](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/16/tech/gaming-gadgets/congo-blood-phones-report/index.html), and clothes [made by childworkers](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/21/hm-factories-myanmar-employed-14-year-old-workers). Attending zoos are not significantly more morally degrading than any other of these examples.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: People spent over £300 million on clothes in the [EU](https://www.statista.com/statistics/419877/clothing-consumption-expenditure-europe-eu/) in 2015. This is an unnecessary leisurely expenditure on products that degrade the environment in the process of being made.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.3.1.2. Pro: [1/3](http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/en/) of all food is wasted, which amounts to over 1.3 billion tons of food wasted every year.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.3.1.3. Con: These sorts of willful ignorance are also bad, and should be condemned.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.4. Con: Humans who attend and enjoy zoos do not consider the environment and circumstances of the captive animals. Because they are distracted by the fun experience of witnessing live animals, the cruelty of caged animals goes unnoticed. This does not constitute willful ignorance.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.1.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.4.2. Con: Allowing oneself to be distracted from an obvious instance of cruelty is contrary to the basic principles of compassion.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.4.2.1. Con: People do not consciously choose to be distracted and thus do not lose any capacity to feel compassion.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.5. Con: Some animals cannot easily be observed in the wild. Watching them in a zoo is more likely an expression of human curiosity about the world than a manifestation of cruelty.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.5.1. Con: Many cruel activities have a primary purpose which is not cruel - for example, the primary purpose of watching cock fights may be entertainment. A willingness to tolerate the cruelty involved in those activities is still cruel.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.6. Con: The amount of suffering caused animals should be considered and corrected on a case-by-case basis. Not every animal in every zoo is suffering.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.4. Pro: Looking to animals or displaying them isn't ethical.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.5. Pro: The [Buenos Aires](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/buenos-aires-zoo-close-animals-captivity-argentina) Zoo used this argument to close after 140 years open.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.5.1. Con: The zoo was [declining in popularity](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/buenos-aires-zoo-close-animals-captivity-argentina), and making losses for its private owners. This was the more likely motive behind closing.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6. Con: Animals lack dignity, and therefore cannot be degraded.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.1. Con: Respecting someone's dignity just consists of respecting their ability to pursue their desires and interests. Thus, any sentient being with desires and interests possesses dignity.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.1.1. Con: The desires and interests of most animals can be adequately provided for in a responsibly-run zoo.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.2. Pro: Many recent works have tried to apply the concept that animals possess [dignity](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2727073), however, all approaches have lacked the necessary conditions and appropriate basis to positively conclude this.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.2.1. Con: Whether or not animals experience feelings of dignity, humans can extend dignity \(in the sense of respect/consideration\) to animals.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.2.1.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.4. Con: "[Dignity](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/dignity)" is defined as the state in which one is worthy of respect. In this case Animals would easily meet this requirement.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.5. Pro: Dignity is a socially constructed human concept. Animals lack the social structures, hierarchies, and interrelationships necessary to create a concept of dignity.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.6. Pro: Any dignity that animals do intuitively seem to possess is just humans projecting human concepts onto them. This is the same as the way in which we attribute human characteristics - like a desire for revenge - to animals even though doing so is unjustified.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.6.1. Con: Studies of dogs' biology suggest they may be capable of emotions like guilt and [shame](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201403/do-dogs-really-feel-guilt-or-shame-we-really-dont-know). A being who does not have dignity cannot feel guilt or shame.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.6.1.1. Con: However, studies have also shown that, specifically in the case of [guilt](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201504/do-we-project-our-own-personalities-our-dogs-behavior), humans project their own personalities on dogs when they act ambiguously. If a person is more prone to feel guilty, he or she will often read the dog’s behaviour as guilt and thus the common assertion that dogs feel guilt may be misguided.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.6.1.2. Pro: Guilt and shame involve feeling that one's dignity has been degraded. They therefore require that one feels that one has dignity.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.6.1.2.1. Con: Guilt requires only enough empathy that a being is able to regret causing another being pain. Dignity is a much more complex concept.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.6.1.3. Pro: Scientists have generally concluded that secondary emotions are restricted to humans and some primates, yet new [research](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699930701273716?scroll=top&needAccess=true) suggests dogs and horses exhibit secondary emotions such as jealousy.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.6.2. Pro: [Anthropomorphism](https://psychcentral.com/news/2010/03/01/why-do-we-anthropomorphize/11766.html), the phenomenon by which humans apply their own characteristics to animals or inanimate objects, has some important functions. For example, by assigning human qualities to an animal or object, we consider it worthy of moral care and consideration. This means that our anthropomorphising is ultimately pragmatically constructed.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.7. Con: Animals have a natural purpose and role to fulfill in the ecosystem, and derive dignity through their fulfillment of those roles.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.7.1. Con: Most animals exist with the single purpose of ensuring their own and their family's survival. Their morality is limited by the scope of this purpose. They can therefore not derive any dignity as it does not exist within their own moral framework.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.7.1.1. Con: Many animals that live in packs or prides fight for leadership. Winning the fight that grants the Alpha-role gives pride while losing against an adversary gives shame. Animals can clearly inherit the concept of dignity.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.7.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.7.1.2. Con: Many [animals](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/50/10/861/233998/Animal-Emotions-Exploring-Passionate) take [pride](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/janimalethics.2.1.0087?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) or shame from their ability to lure mating partners.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.7.2. Con: It is difficult to assess if animals are cognizant of the impact their individual roles have on the ecosystem, or if they are operating based on pure instinct alone.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.7.3. Con: The natural purpose of many animals is to kill other animals. It is therefore inconsistent to say that the natural role of animals is morally important, but also that it is bad for animals to suffer.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.7.3.1. Con: The natural purpose of many animals is not to kill other animals. The killing of other animals is rather a necessity for survival, which is the actual natural purpose.
1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.7.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.5.3.8.4.3. Pro: Zoos used to pay explorers to get animals, helping and increasing a brutal [animal trade](https://smartasset.com/taxes/the-economics-of-zoos) rooted in racism and colonialism.
1.1.5.3.8.4.3.1. Con: Precisely to put behind their colonial past, in the 1970s zoos updated their policies to be modern institutions. Now they do not to put a [price tag](https://smartasset.com/taxes/the-economics-of-zoos) on animals and work through barter and donations.
1.1.5.3.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.2.2.
1.1.5.3.10. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.8.1.2.1.
1.1.5.3.11. Con: With the technology available to us today, all that needs to be learnt about an animal can be learnt without the need to confine them permanently.
1.1.5.3.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.3.1.1.
1.1.5.3.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.1.
1.1.5.3.12. Con: Not everyone have access to zoos because is not for free.
1.1.5.3.13. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.1.3.4.
1.1.5.3.14. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.1.
1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.1.
1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.4.2.
1.1.8. Con: While zoos can be perceived as unethical, the solution is not to ban zoos altogether, but rather to encourage \(or punish if not respected\) the good treatment of animals. This would allow for zoos to remain important sources of knowledge both for children and for researchers, who can help other animals living in the wild.
1.1.8.1. Con: To ban zoos is to end the paradox that modern zoos live nowadays. They’re organizations with a [mandate](http://www.waza.org/en/site/about-waza/vision-and-mission) to support conservation and education of the public regarding wild animals and nature that also manage captive wildlife.
1.1.8.1.1. Pro: One example is the [penguin paradox](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1748-1090.1967.tb00290.x). Penguins are one of the most popular animals in zoos and yet in the wild 10 of the world’s 18 species of penguin are still [threatened](https://www.birdlife.org/list-penguin-species) with extinction and populations are declining. Old reports pointed that only one type of penguin was imported to the USA, and only an infinitesimal percentage of them survived even though the zoos´ high efforts to prevent death.
1.1.8.1.2. Pro: The dedication to conservation and breeding has forced people who run zoos into two [opposing roles](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215005382): protector and killer.
1.1.8.2. Con: It is unethical to keep sentient beings captive in spite of how they are treated.
1.1.8.2.1. Con: Regardless of whether lower animals are sentient at all, valuing freedom in this abstract way \(divorced from more basic concerns like "enough space to not feel confined"\) is something only humans are capable of.
1.1.8.3. Con: As one should not fight war with violence, the same way one should not help animals in the wild by taking some of them captive. Overall, that is worse.
1.1.9. Con: You can't remember what was the first film you ever saw or the first game that you ever played, but almost everyone can remember the first time they saw some kind of animal. Zoo's can provide a memorable experience for kids that is not possible in any other way.
1.1.10. Pro: Banning zoos would be an opportunity to launch new pathways to protect endangered and not endangered animals in their own environment through the right legislation and support of all human beings.
1.1.11. Con: Because zoos can raise revenue themselves, rather than being reliant on funding, it means they are better able to fulfil their role in modern conservation through a flexible and creative use of their capital.
1.1.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.12.5.
1.1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.4.3.
1.1.11.3. Con: All kinds of business can provide money and funds to nature conservation. This makes a zoo a non-exclusive way for nature conservation which means that we don't need zoos to provide funds to nature conservation.
1.1.11.3.1. Pro: None out of what is considered by some to be the [top 10](https://www.gvi.co.uk/blog/10-best-organisations-to-follow-help-endangered-animals/) organizations that protect endangered species are zoos.
1.1.11.3.2. Pro: In a list of the most popular nature conservation [grants](http://www.conservationleadershipprogramme.org/grants/other-funding-sources/) in the UK only 2 of them are zoos and only a few ammount of funds are granted to them.
1.1.12. Pro: The only right way to observe and look at an animal is to observe it in its natural environment.
1.1.12.1. Pro: In every country you have animals you can observe in their natural habitat.
1.1.13. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.1.

1.1.15. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.1.16. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.
1.2. Con: Zoos do a lot of important work to improve animal well-being.
1.2.1. Pro: Zoos provide a great platform for conducting important research and observations which are beneficial to both humans and animals.
1.2.1.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264090313_Connecting_to_nature_at_the_zoo_Implications_for_responding_to_climate_change) has shown that zoo visits may encourage concern about climate change.
1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.2.
1.2.1.3. Con: Although zoos potentially can provide data on their animals, this information isn’t necessarily accurate because the enclosures incorrectly simulate the animals’ real habitats and the atmosphere  of the zoo suppresses the animals with stress.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.8.
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.
1.2.1.3.4. Pro: Despite enrichment efforts, [chimpanzees](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020101) engage in at least some abnormal behaviour.
1.2.1.4. Con: Any information gleaned from animals in captivity could be equally learned from observation in the wild. With video readily available online, humans can learn more about animals by watching them in videos in their natural habitat than as prisoners who don't behave naturally in captivity.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: Not all animal research can be done strictly through visual observation. Disease and treatment research may require consistent monitoring through blood draws and temperature checks.
1.2.1.5. Con: Often times zoos cause more harm to their occupants than anything else. Investment should be made in reserves, where animals keep their instincts, are protected, and can be studied without impacting migration or power systems within the group.
1.2.1.6. Pro: [Oregon zoo](http://www.oregonzoo.org/conserve/research-zoo) collaborates with universities and governments to fill gaps in scientific knowledge about wildlife.
1.2.1.7. Pro: The [Institute for Conservation Medicine](https://www.stlzoo.org/conservation/institute-for-conservation-medicine/) uses zoos as grounds for researching and developing medicine for both humans and animals.
1.2.1.8. Pro: The [Zoological Society of London](https://www.zsl.org/science/research) \(ZSL\) does a lot of groundbreaking research, including the enhancement of our knowledge on: [evolutionary processes](https://www.zsl.org/science/research/evolution-and-molecular-ecology), [biodiversity and macroecology](https://www.zsl.org/science/research/biodiversity-and-macroecology) and the [identification and investigation of wildlife diseases](https://www.zsl.org/science/research/wildlife-epidemiology).
1.2.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.5.
1.2.1.10. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.2.1.11. Pro: The Detroit Zoological Society's [Center for Zoo Animal Welfare](http://www.czaw.org/) conducts research on animal behavior and provides resources in animal welfare for zoos and aquariums.
1.2.1.11.1. Con: If zoos did not exist, there would be no need to study the best ways to make animals thrive in captivity.
1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.
1.2.3. Con: Even if zoos ultimately improve animal well-being on the whole, this does not necessarily imply that they are ethical. We would not condone medical research facilities that experimented on children, even if ultimately the medicines produced improved human well-being.
1.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.
1.2.3.2. Con: Zoos can do good work to progress the well-being of animals and treat them ethically at the same time. The zoo industry should not be shut down if it can be regulated to be ethical and beneficial.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: Cruelty and unjust imprisonment of animals are inherent to the concept of a zoo. It is not possible for a zoo to be an ethical institution.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.
1.2.3.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.7.
1.2.3.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Controlled and simulated environments are prerequisites of specific treatment or conservation efforts. Modern zoos act like medical facilities, but instead of experimenting on the animals, they simply care for them.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Despite everything zoos have learned in the past several decades about animals, zoo ethics and welfare have not really evolved, this is called the “knowledge translation gap.” and it´s real because zoos only tend to talk about [in-situ ethics](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10888705.2018.1513838) which ignores the ethical problem of zoos and focus on ethics within zoos. Having a "better life" is not necessarily a “good life”.
1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.2.5. Pro: Zoos these days are designed to nurture the animals in surroundings that provide almost natural environments. Often these animals would otherwise become extinct, or suffer habitat destruction, without medical and nutritional assistance.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Scientific studies can enhance animal well-being, and awareness and exposure fosters greater love and understanding of their needs and habitats.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Animals learn a lot from people; they are trained to live in their natural environment.
1.2.5.3. Pro: This becomes increasingly true as humans continue to develop the planet's surface.
1.2.6. Pro: Today's zoos do more to help animals than hurt them. Rather than anthropomorphize animals, assuming they feel about freedom as we do, we need to recognize that a good zoo home can keep an animal content as well as healthy.
1.2.7. Pro: Zoos feed the animals and protect them from predators that want to harm them.
1.2.7.1. Con: It's natural process that one animal eats another one.
1.2.8. Pro: Zoos often function as large/dangerous animal hospitals/hospices. Animals that are injured, sick, or in need of surgery are often cared for at zoos.
1.2.8.1. Pro: Zoos help animals. For example, at the [Minnesota zoo](http://mnzoo.org/blog/bald-eagles/) there is a [bald eagle](http://mnzoo.org/get-involved/animal-sponsorship/soar-minnesota-zoo-sponsor-bald-eagle-today/) that was found with a wing injury. They found that the wing healed the wrong way and she is unable to fly therefore cannot be released into the wild. If there were no zoos for her to live at she would not survive because she would be unable to get food on her own.
1.2.8.2. Con: Zoos are often asked to take care of [exotic](https://www.peta.org/issues/companion-animal-issues/companion-animals-factsheets/inside-exotic-animal-trade/) animals whose owners purchased them irresponsibly or even illegally, yet as most zoos do not accept this kind of donations, or are concerned by the spreading of diseases, most of these animals end up euthanized.
1.2.8.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.1.7.1.1.
1.2.8.4. Pro: There is the famous case of Fiona the Hippo in the Cincinnati Zoo. Fiona was born 6 weeks premature and required extensive medical care, [including assistance from Cincinnati Children's Hospital](https://www.wcpo.com/longform/how-one-premature-hippo-beat-the-odds-and-became-a-worldwide-sensation), one of the world's leading children's hospitals.
1.2.9. Con: Animals are under stressful conditions while being held captive in a reduced environment that exposes them to human annoying sounds and behaviors towards them.
1.2.10. Con: The research data attained from zoos is questionable due to the insufficient dietary, [social](http://www.lcanimal.org/index.php/campaigns/elephants/wild-vs-captive) and [biological](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/the-life-of-animals-in-captivity-versus-the-wild/) needs of animals in their natural [environment](https://awionline.org/content/wild-vs-captivity).
1.2.10.1. Pro: Interactive dolphin [behaviors](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233559576_Human_Interactions_with_Free-Ranging_and_Captive_Bottlenose_Dolphins) in the captive environment consists primarily of actions that had been signaled and then reinforced by humans. Potential indicators of disturbance in research are more frequent in the captive environment.
1.2.10.2. Pro: It is only by conducting studies on wild cetaceans and making comparative assessments that the [value of captive studies](http://www.wdcs.co.uk/media/submissions_bin/capmayerscijustifications.pdf) can be assessed.
1.2.11. Con: Zoos, as a whole, cannot recreate most animals' natural environments, climate, or scope of living space. Their well-being would be better left in their natural habitat.
1.2.11.1. Con: For many smaller animals the zoo environment is suffcient and not restricting their well beeing.
1.2.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.5.
1.2.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.7.
1.2.11.4. Con: -> See 1.2.8.
1.2.12. Con: This improvement to animal wellbeing could be replicated by using designs that aren't as restrictive as zoos such as safari parks in the animals' natural habitat.
1.2.13. Pro: High quality zoos do a lot in order to insure that animals in their possession are well cared for. Zoo environments do not have predators, have reliable food and water, and have access to extremely sophisticated medical aid. Many species of animals live much longer in zoo care than they would in the wild.
1.2.14. Pro: Zoos and their organized contributors have significantly and uniquely advanced zoological knowledge and animal welfare.
1.2.15. Con: The methods of capture, transportation and accommodation environment are not that visible to the visitor \(the one who pays\) and so they tend to be neglected and often the easiest path ends up being the one that is taken: [Freeing Willy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7fKTh5uAxE) or [Blackfish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEUmG4hRV4o)
1.2.16. Con: Most of the work in the field of [animal welfare](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26882778_Measuring_zoo_animal_welfare_Theory_and_practice) has been conducted on farm animals.
1.2.17. Con: The [five freedom](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4810049/) principles adopted by Zoos in 1990, do not follows the increase of scientific understanding around animal welfare, being inherently obscure, and therefore lacks utility.
1.2.17.1. Pro: After applying the five freedom principles, the animals in the Surakarta Zoo and Gembira Loka Zoo, have not been free from disruption, stress, and pressure due to the passing over [vehicles](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5639098/).
1.2.17.2. Pro: The perceptions of animals may be held simultaneously by different interest groups and may often be [incompatible](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12304-018-9311-5), thus often making it difficult to follow the ‘Five Freedoms’ in practice.
1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.
1.4. Con: Zoos have a big impact on economic development.
1.4.1. Pro: Zoos generate stable, long-lasting jobs, relatively safe from global competition.
1.4.1.1. Pro: The [Association of Zoos and Aquariums](http://www.congressweb.com/Assets/ActionAlerts/AZA/AZA%20Economic%20Impact%20Report%202013.pdf) \(AZA\) provides more than 193.000 Americans with jobs.
1.4.1.2. Con: The same jobs could easily be generated if zoos were replaced by animal parks, which are more ethical.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: An Eco Park can provide [job alternatives](http://www.soeagra.com/ijert/vol3/2ijert.pdf) to jobs associated with zoos, such as shopkeepers, hotel & restaurants owners, transportations, guides, and daily labors.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Ecoparks use ecological landscape features to reduce watering maintenance while enhancing wildlife and [human values](http://www.ijern.com).
1.4.1.3. Pro: Zoos are necessarily local, so there is no danger of global competition undermining the ability of local zoos to survive.
1.4.1.4. Con: Workers with expertise in animal care could move to many other professions - for example, in the production of educational resources and documentaries which would serve to replace the role that zoos play.
1.4.1.5. Con: Most of the work provided by [zoos](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2001/spring/art01.pdf) are volunteer programs.
1.4.2. Pro: Zoos help positively anchor the identity of their location in the mind of investors, tourists, re-locators, media and decision makers.
1.4.3. Pro: In 2014, the [AZA](https://www.aza.org/assets/2332/aza_economic_impact_report_2014.pdf) added over $6 billion to US GDP.
1.4.3.1. Con: This is [0.03%](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp) of US GDP, a negligible quantity when compared to the vast size of the US economy.
1.4.4. Pro: Zoos can profile ecological innovation and solutions before large and socially inclusive audiences.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Zoos are prominent within research for conservation and health. Cooperation with [One Health \(p.1-3\)](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S2352771416300283/1-s2.0-S2352771416300283-main.pdf?_tid=83bc4080-59a3-11e7-8dab-00000aacb362&acdnat=1498394628_af3bd229fc38f6196f1c984798c6afc1) has generated templates for collaborative initiatives and sustainable solutions.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Emerging Infectious Diseases \(EID\) are increasingly recognized as a serious threat to both human health and biodiversity. Collaboration between zoos and public health institutions offers the opportunity to progress our understanding and ability to control EID's [\(Onehealth p.1\)](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S2352771416300283/1-s2.0-S2352771416300283-main.pdf?_tid=83bc4080-59a3-11e7-8dab-00000aacb362&acdnat=1498394628_af3bd229fc38f6196f1c984798c6afc1).
1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: Implementation of the EC Directive 1999/22 requirements is [inconsistent](https://www.bornfree.org.uk/storage/media/content/files/Publications/FINDINGS%20%26%20RECOMMENDATIONS.pdf) across the EU and enforcement is largely lacking in the majority of EU Member States. National laws often lack detailed provisions relating public health. Only England and Poland have established specific regulation in this aspect.
1.4.4.2. Pro: The [EU](http://www.johnreganassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/the_eu_and_europes_zoos.pdf) coordinates with Europe's progressive zoos on a number of areas including environmental policy, biodiversity and furthering a common, cultural European identity.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: Some zoo animals cannot [successfully](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/583114/IPOL_STU\(2017\)583114_EN.pdf) adapt to any current zoo conditions despite the EU efforts.
1.4.5. Con: The economic benefits of an institution are irrelevant if the institution profits from unjust exploitation and the violation of the rights of sentient creatures.
1.4.6. Con: If zoos were banned, the economic activity would simply shift elsewhere; the ticket revenues zoos get would go towards the revenue of movie theatres or alternative sources of entertainment, and those sectors would grow.
1.4.6.1. Con: Zoos provide a unique experience of witnessing real life animals. Alternative sources like movie theaters cannot simulate this effectively to pick up on that revenue.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: The attractiveness of zoos is irrelevant. As long as movie theatres are comparatively more attractive than spending the time doing nothing, people will choose to attend movie theatres.
1.4.6.1.1.1. Con: Zoos are an outdoor activity therefore it is likely people who enjoy zoos won't trade it for an indoor activity like cinemas.
1.4.6.1.1.1.1. Con: This is still economic activity - these people may pay fees to enter national parks, buy hiking gear, etc.
1.4.6.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Buying hiking gear that could last for several years cannot compare to the stream of revenue that zoos gets from visitors everyday.
1.4.6.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Niche](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/mountain-boarding-and-skiving-becoming-more-popular-2025427.html) outdoor activities like [rock climbing](http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/peak-profits-business-rock-climbing/article/1340295) are becoming increasingly popular and business surrounding them is growing.
1.4.6.1.1.1.2. Pro: If people who visit zoos preferred to watch things on a screen, they would already choose to go to movie theatres over zoos in the status quo. The fact that they choose to spend their day outdoors implies that they would not choose to stay indoors if zoos didn't exist.
1.4.6.1.1.2. Pro: Most forms of entertainment/ways of spending leisure time involve spending money on products, and thus raising demand in the economy.
1.4.6.1.2. Pro: The fact that zoos manage to survive financially despite the fact that movies are far more accessible and cheap shows that they offer a unique, differentiated product that cannot be approximated by other forms of entertainment.
1.4.6.1.2.1. Pro: While the average price of a movie ticket in the US is [$8.73](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/19/us-cinema-ticket-prices-record-high), zoos can far exceed that price: an adult ticket for San Diego Zoo costs [$52](http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/tickets) and an adult ticket for Louisville Zoo costs [$16.25](https://louisvillezoo.org/plan/prices/). In the UK, the Edinburgh Zoo costs [£17.00](http://www.edinburghzoo.org.uk/plan-your-visit/day-planner/tickets-prices/) and the Australian Zoo [59](http://www.australiazoo.com.au/visit-us/admission-prices/) AUD.
1.4.6.2. Pro: [Two](https://www.aza.org/partnerships-visitor-demographics) out of three adults who visit zoos do so with a child, and several studies point out that a ‘[family outing](http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2017/zb/bgrd/backgroundfile-101510.pdf)’ is one of the [predominant](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233515887_The_Demand_for_Zoos_and_Aquariums) reasons to go to a zoo. Therefore other forms of family entertainment \(such as going to the movies or to a theme park\) could possibly replace zoos.
1.4.6.2.1. Con: Parents recognise zoos as both educational and recreational [\(Cain & Meritt, p. 19\)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233515887_The_Demand_for_Zoos_and_Aquariums). Other family activities only provide recreation.
1.4.6.2.1.1. Pro: In a study about [Toronto](http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2017/zb/bgrd/backgroundfile-101510.pdf) zoo visitors, respondents rated zoos in a 5 point scale with a 4.5 as “conservation education facility” and a 4.7 as a “fun place to see animals”.
1.4.6.2.2. Pro: While there are fewer entertainment activities for small children \(e.g. playgrounds or shopping malls\), when children get older, amusement parks, museums, sports events and movies become “more meaningful substitutes” \([Cain & Meritt, p. 19](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233515887_The_Demand_for_Zoos_and_Aquariums)\).
1.4.6.3. Pro: Many cities offer attraction passes that combine zoos, museums and amusement parks, thus equating zoos to other forms of entertainment. For example, US cities offer [packs](https://www.smartdestinations.com/san-diego-attractions-and-tours/_d_Sdo-p1.html?pass=Sdo_Prod_Go) with several attractions, including zoos.
1.4.6.4. Pro: Many [leisure](http://www.hassra.org.uk/members/DWP_S234666.asp) business groups include [zoos](http://www.taytopark.ie/) or [safaris](https://www.sixflags.com/greatadventure/attractions/animal-attractions) in their [holdings](https://seaworldparks.com/), besides amusement and aquatic parks. Similarly, many tourist [guides](https://www.esmadrid.com/en/amusement-parks-and-zoos) and [media](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2015/07/15/tripadvisor-best-amusement-parks-zoos-aquariums/30176163/) outlets offer lists of best attractions that include amusement parks, aquatic parks and zoos.
1.4.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.12.5.
1.4.8. Con: Like with many other business that may be correct but it doesn't matter if it is unethical. Selling whale meat, fox fur, weapons, ivory, oil, or diamonds are also good for economic development, but it doesn't mean they are good things.
1.4.9. Con: Many zoos not affiliated with the AZA spend nothing on [conservation](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2003/11/news-zoo-commitment-conservation-critic/).
1.4.10. Con: Zoos have a big economic impact, because they are intended to be mainly a business which isn´t strict to the principles of nature conservation, draining resources from [real natural conservation](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Craig_Redmond/publication/265270905_Zoos_Failing_animals_conservation_and_education/links/55a4bcd508ae00cf99c916a8/Zoos-Failing-animals-conservation-and-education.pdf).
1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.
1.6. Pro: Zoos violate animal rights.
1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.
1.6.2. Con: Human rights should override animal rights where they conflict.
1.6.2.1. Con: Protecting those who cannot protect themselves is a responsibility we have with the amount of power we have. The less able a being is to advocate for itself, the more we should protect it.
1.6.2.2. Pro: As human beings, we shouldn't be [cruel to animals](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs12%3A10&version=NLT).  But, our lives are [more important than theirs](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis9&version=NLT).
1.6.2.2.1. Con: The belief that human lives are more important than those of [animals](http://worldanimal.net/documents/4_Religion.pdf) is not one held by everyone, or adopted by all faiths.
1.6.2.3. Con: This is not a conflict of equivalent rights. The marginal impact on a human's entertainment does not justify the massive infringement on animals' happiness and freedom of movement.
1.6.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.2.1.
1.6.2.4. Pro: Human emotions, even abstract ones, are relatively easy to calculate, whereas we cannot accurately assess what animals think and feel.
1.6.2.4.1. Con: [Neuroscience proves](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-02/nrn-updating-animal-welfare/7987266?pfmredir=sm) animals experience a wide range of emotions.
1.6.2.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.6.6.1.3.
1.6.2.4.2. Con: Humans are better at displaying how they think and feel through verbal communication. Verbal communication is untrustworthy because humans can lie. It should not be considered an accurate measurement of how a being thinks and feels.
1.6.2.4.3. Con: Animals may not always be good at expressing what they think but they are experts at expressing how they feel through the use of body language. We can accurately assess what animals feel.
1.6.2.5. Pro: We are unable to understand how, or even if, animals feel [pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_animals) in a way that is remotely similar to how humans do. We should therefore prioritise quantifiable human utility.
1.6.2.5.1. Pro: An important part of suffering in a morally meaningful way is the ability to reflect on that suffering, to be consciously aware of it, to anticipate it, and to entertain counterfactuals where the suffering is absent. We are unsure if animals are capable of doing this.
1.6.2.5.1.1. Con: [Experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness) on dogs show animals can be aware of, anticipate, and take precautions against pain. They can even become depressed when they feel they have no power to prevent pain.
1.6.2.5.2. Con: Just because we have not yet discovered if captive animals feel pain in a similar way to captive humans, does not give us the moral right to prioritize our needs over theirs in the meantime.
1.6.2.5.3. Pro: For example, any fishing technique that includes the use of a hook could be regarded as a cruel practice due to the pain it causes the fish. However, a scientific study has discovered that fish are [immune](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/9797948/Fish-cannot-feel-pain-say-scientists.html) to pain as their brain functions are not developed enough.
1.6.2.5.3.1. Pro: This example indicates that our intuitions about animal pain can be wildly inaccurate, and that in fact it is an open question the extent to which most animals can feel pain.
1.6.2.5.4. Con: We know that animals show clinical indications of pain and will [actively](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11240076) [avoid pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10766114) and death. Imposing suffering on an animal that does not want to experience suffering is immoral.
1.6.2.5.5. Con: Humans with congenital pain insensitivity do not feel physical pain. We do not afford them less rights or consideration because of it.
1.6.2.5.6. Con: Observation of animal behavior provides a reasonable indication of the extent to which [animals feel pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_animals). [This](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK32655/) should be enough to justify the consideration of animals as if they feel pain.
1.6.2.5.6.1. Con: We can observe mechanistic, pain-like responses from animals. This does not imply that they actually have meaningful pain experiences.
1.6.2.5.6.1.1. Con: Science allows us to study animals and understand how they feel pain, from seeing the biological requirements for experiencing pain existing in the same way, to witnessing neurological reactions by connecting animals to technological equipment. We may not know what it's like to be an animal but we can make a fair assumption thanks to scientific methods.
1.6.2.5.6.1.1.1. Pro: The fact that [cows](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159115002269), for example, react to analgesics suggests they feel pain in a similar way as humans.
1.6.2.5.6.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.5.1.1.
1.6.2.5.6.1.1.3. Pro: Animals [apply](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/orangutans-use-plant-extracts-to-treat-pain1/?utm_campaign=daily-digest&utm_source=sendgrid&utm_medium=email) pain relief in the wild. They do this because they experience pain.
1.6.2.5.6.1.1.4. Pro: We [test](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0023677214562849) drugs for human pain relief on animals. We do this because some animals feel pain in a similar way to humans.
1.6.2.5.6.1.1.5. Pro: We have developed pain relief [drugs](https://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/ResourcesforYou/AnimalHealthLiteracy/ucm392732.htm) for animals. This is because they feel pain.
1.6.2.5.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.5.3.
1.6.2.5.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.5.1.1.
1.6.2.5.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.5.6.1.1.5.
1.6.2.5.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.5.6.1.1.4.
1.6.2.5.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.5.6.1.1.3.
1.6.2.5.7. Con: Our capacity to feel pain is shaped by evolutionary processes. Since the [same evolutionary processes](https://nuffieldbioethics.org/wp-content/uploads/Animals-Chapter-4-The-Capacity-of-Animals-to-Experience-Pain-Distress-and-Suffering.pdf) have shaped the neurology of other animals, we should assume that they have a similar capacity for pain. \([Singer](http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/singer03.htm)\)
1.6.2.5.7.1. Con: We have cognitive capacities that are far more complex than those of animals. While animals may have evolved similar pain-like responses, there is no reason to suppose that their pain feels anything like our pain.
1.6.2.5.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.5.1.1.
1.6.2.5.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.5.6.1.1.1.
1.6.2.5.8. Con: There are [substantial similarities](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/do-animals-feel-pain-in-the-same-way-as-humans-do-10371800.html) in pain-related behaviour across all species, suggesting that animals experience pain in similar ways to us.
1.6.2.5.8.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.5.6.1.
1.6.2.5.9. Con: The only way human pain is more quantifiable, is through our capacity to verbally communicate our experience of it. Humans can easily betray the accuracy of their pain experience when verbally expressing it through ways such as lying or exaggerating.
1.6.2.5.9.1. Pro: Some humans cannot self-report pain, for example very young children or people with cognitive impairment. Despite not being able to quantify it, we accept they are able to feel pain.
1.6.2.5.9.2. Con: Even if humans can lie, their capacity to verbally communicate makes it easier for researchers and medical professionals to study and quantify that pain.
1.6.2.5.9.2.1. Con: That verbal communication makes it slightly more easy to study humans, is not a sufficient reason to ignore the consideration of potential animal suffering.
1.6.2.5.9.3. Con: Human pain is more quantifiable because of relatability. A human can be certain that other humans feel pain in the same way because of their shared humanity and because one can recognize and relate to their description of pain.
1.6.2.5.9.3.1. Pro: Research has shown that the ability to feel pain is necessary to understand someone else's pain. Patients with brain damage who are not able to feel pain experience a [decrease](https://theconversation.com/why-it-hurts-to-see-others-suffer-pain-and-empathy-linked-in-the-brain-48336) in their ability to have empathy for pain.
1.6.2.5.9.3.2. Con: Even if human pain is easier to quantify as it is more relatable to other humans, this does not constitute a valid reason to dismiss or ignore animal pain.
1.6.2.5.9.3.3. Pro: We have knowledge of human pain because we directly experience that pain. This is not information which is miscommunicated or untrustworthy.
1.6.2.5.9.4. Pro: Most people have strong incentive to exaggerate their pain when hurt, or to even outright fake it. The more hurt you are, the more reason there is to put more attention into treating you and to sympathize with your struggle.
1.6.2.5.10. Pro: We understand perfectly the extent to which humans can feel pain or suffer in meaningful ways, since we can directly access those experiences by feeling pain ourselves. By contrast, we have no idea what it feels like to suffer as an animal, and therefore whether that is meaningful or not.
1.6.2.5.10.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.5.6.1.1.
1.6.2.5.10.2. Con: -> See 1.6.2.5.6.1.1.3.
1.6.2.5.10.3. Con: -> See 1.6.2.5.6.1.1.5.
1.6.2.5.10.4. Con: -> See 1.6.2.5.6.1.1.4.
1.6.2.5.11. Con: If animals do feel pain and we ignore it, we are committing moral atrocities. If animals do not feel pain and we treat them as if they do, not much is lost.
1.6.2.5.11.1. Pro: Given this balance of benefits vs costs, if there is even a small probability that animals do feel significant pain, we should not harm them.
1.6.2.5.11.2. Pro: New technology continues to emerge which can provide substitutes for things we traditionally use or do at the expense of animals.
1.6.3. Pro: Animals should not be viewed as property or objects for entertainment purposes, both of which zoos [violate](http://www.animalequality.net/entertainment).
1.6.3.1. Pro: Many people view it as immoral to consume [products](https://fashionwithaheart.wordpress.com/2012/05/06/animal-cruelty-in-the-fashion-industry/) whose [creation](https://craftsmanship.net/eco-fashions-animal-rights-delusion/) requires cruelty to animals \(for example, clothing made out of real [fur](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/cornelia-guest/why-i-dont-wear-fur_b_1131258.html)\). Similarly, zoos' production of entertainment value rests on harm inflicted on animals.
1.6.3.2. Con: It is not true that keeping animals as property is intrinsically wrong. For example, it is difficult to see anything wrong with keeping a pet who is well cared for, loved, and happy.
1.6.3.2.1. Con: Pets have been domesticated for the purpose of human companionship. Animals in zoos are still wild, and thus it is wrong to keep them as property in captivity.
1.6.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.2.
1.6.3.4. Con: Accredited zoos and aquariums do not keep animals solely as property or for pure entertainment purposes, as circuses do; most of the time, animals are kept as part of a breeding program to save endangered species.
1.6.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.1.1.1.
1.6.3.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.1.3.
1.6.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.8.1.
1.6.3.6. Pro: Zoos are voyeurism.
1.6.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.4.
1.6.3.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.3.2.
1.6.5. Con: This is not always the case. Reputable zoos are accredited by the[Association of Zoos and Aquariums](https://www.aza.org/) \(AZA\) and are held to high standards for the treatment of the animals.
1.6.5.1. Con: An internal accreditation process is unlikely to prioritize the interests of animals over the financial interests of zoos.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: This trade-off can be avoided as prioritizing the financial interests of zoos and prioritizing the interests of animals can be made to be aligned with each other.
1.6.5.1.1.1. Pro: Zoos often receive funding to aid in improving animal well-being.
1.6.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.2.
1.6.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: [AZA](https://www.aza.org/conservation-funding)-accredited institutions, governmental agencies, foundations, and corporate philanthropies provide critical financial [support](https://www.aza.org/other-conservation-funding-sources) to conservation, research, and education.
1.6.5.1.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.6.2.1.
1.6.5.1.1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.1.
1.6.5.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Accredited zoos, such as AZA, have standards and requirements that they have to meet, which means the animals have plenty of food, water, places to hide, and things to be given to them so that it's something new and out of the ordinary to have. They also treat their animals with the utmost care, therefore keeping them out of harmful situations. We are still learning on how to give the best care, same as we are still learning about humans.
1.6.5.1.1.1.3. Pro: Many zoos [depend](https://smartasset.com/taxes/the-economics-of-zoos) on private donations and government funding. They receive this funding because they do provide good services for both the public and for animals.
1.6.5.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: In 2012, 17% of the Woodland Park Zoos operating revenue came from donations and grants, and 31% came from public support [\(annual report, p.9\)](http://zoo.org/document.doc?id=964).
1.6.5.1.1.1.4. Pro: The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria \([EAZA](http://www.eaza.net/about-us/)\) provides funding and manpower for education about animals, conservation projects and research to improve our understanding of animals.
1.6.5.1.1.1.5. Con: Since humans are the ones that establish what are good conditions for animals and provide funding accordingly, it is still possible that financial interests and animals’ interests are not totally aligned.
1.6.5.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.3.2.
1.6.5.1.2. Con: The AZA is not tied to the financials of the zoos in any way other than the fact that many people will only go to an accredited zoo. The AZA is only concerned with the [welfare](https://www.aza.org/about-us) of the animals in zoos.
1.6.5.1.3. Con: Even though some zoos in the US generate huge revenues, most are [non-profit organisations](http://blog.wedid.it/i-analyzed-data-on-458-nonprofit-zoos-and-aquariums-heres-what-i-found), therefore they are able to put the interest of animals and conservation over financial interests.
1.6.5.1.3.1. Con: Non-profit organizations often depend on grants which state exactly what the money can be used for, which can limit conservation and animal-interest efforts.
1.6.5.1.3.1.1. Pro: For example, many grants provide for building-facility improvements, when a zoo would rather emphasize training its employees or buying supplies.
1.6.5.2. Con: These standards are not [adequate](https://www.idausa.org/campaign/elephants/10-worst-zoos-2016/) for all animals, for example, they do not meet the needs of elephants. Some of the worst zoos for pachyderms are accredited by the AZA.
1.6.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.1.2.2.
1.6.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.
1.6.5.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.6.
1.6.6. Pro: Humans beings don't have dominion over non-human beings.
1.6.6.1. Con: All animals have various powers they exercise over other animals for their own survival benefit.  To the extent that zoos preserve biodiversity, humans have a survival interest in preserving these species.
1.6.6.2. Con: Whether humans want or not, they have power over animal's wellbeing by simply having an effect on the planet and on animal's habitats. Zoos actively try to counteract that negative effect humans inevitably have.
1.6.6.3. Pro: According to [scriptures](http://biblereasons.com/animals/), animals are God's creatures thus men have no right to play God to captive animals.
1.6.6.4. Con: Genesis 1:26 - Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”.
1.6.6.4.1. Con: Any decision by society on how to treat animals should not be based on religion nor any other non-falsifiable belief.
1.6.6.4.1.1. Con: Any treatment is based on a belief. Fair or unfair is only opinion, not scientific fact.
1.6.6.4.2. Con: Man has taken 'dominion' out of context in relation to the treatment of animals. Many have interpreted it not as exploitation and captivity of animals, but having a moral responsibility for their well-being. Thus, zoos are in violation of this, by [biblical standards](https://tifwe.org/a-biblical-view-of-dominion-stewardship/).
1.6.7. Con: There are [laws](https://www.animallaw.info/article/brief-summary-laws-pertaining-zoos) that require zoos to maintain a certain level of well-being for their animals.
1.6.7.1. Con: All [cold-blooded animals](https://www.animallaw.info/article/brief-summary-laws-pertaining-zoos) are excluded from the federal definition of animal.
1.6.7.2. Pro: If zoos are [AZA](https://www.aza.org/) accredited, they have taken many steps to insure the wellbeing of the animals within their zoo, and are sometimes better environments for the animals than the wild.

1.6.7.2.4. Con: -> See 1.6.5.1.
1.6.7.2.5. Con: -> See 1.6.5.2.
1.6.8. Pro: No animal has the ability to provide consent to be removed from the wild and locked in a cage.
1.6.8.1. Con: No animal has the ability to consent to be released into the wild and risk starving to death or being eaten alive.
1.6.8.2. Pro: No animal has the ability to consent to be released into the wild and risk starving to death or being eaten alive.
1.6.9. Con: Any rights which zoos uniquely violate \(e.g. freedom of movement or habitat\) are higher order rights which animals are not deserving of.
1.6.9.1. Con: Zoos do not just violate higher-order rights; they also violate fundamental low-level rights like the right to be free from suffering.
1.6.9.1.1. Pro: Zoos cause suffering to animals.
1.6.9.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.

1.6.9.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.8.
1.6.9.1.1.5. Con: Many wild animals experience more [suffering](https://foundational-research.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/) due to human activity.
1.6.9.1.1.6. Con: Zoos help save endangered species from complete extinction, and even allows rebooting the population that has gone extinct in wild.

1.6.9.1.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.
1.6.9.1.1.10. Con: Better regulations are important, but a zoo with programmes and space relevant to each species etc. can help generate income to finance conservation and breeding.
1.6.9.1.1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.
1.6.9.1.1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.2.
1.6.9.1.1.11. Pro: Zoos have to kill some animals that are closely related genetically to avoid inbreeding. Exchanges between zoos are not always possible and can be traumatic.
1.6.9.1.1.12. Pro: [Reptiles](https://science.rspca.org.uk/sciencegroup/wildlife/reportsandresources/captivity) suffer in captivity.
1.6.9.1.1.13. Pro: [Dolphins and whales](http://faada.org/userfiles/new%20FACT%20SHEET%20DOLPHIN%200909.pdf) experience confinement in captivity resulting high levels of [physiological stress](http://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/senate/committee/history/animalwelfare_ctte/dolphins_whales_in_captivity/report.pdf). This can cause behavioural abnormalities, illness, decreased resistance to disease and premature death.
1.6.9.1.1.13.1. Pro: Dolphins reject captivity by [suiciding](http://www.bio.uaic.ro/publicatii/anale_zoologie/issue/2004/42-2004.pdf) or escaping. One of the most common reasons of the captive dolphins’ death are suicide by refusing the food or striking himself against the pools walls till it dies.
1.6.9.1.1.13.1.1. Pro: In a 1995 compilation of cetacean releases into the wild, 58 bottlenose dolphins and 20 killer whales are mentioned, although most of these were accidental releases or [escapes](https://www.worldanimalprotection.us.org/sites/default/files/us_files/the_case_against_marine_mammals_in_captivity_hsus.pdf).
1.6.9.1.1.14. Pro: Animals held in zoos can be exposed to [noise pollution](https://vet.ufmg.br/ARQUIVOS/FCK/file/wildlife%20&%20zoology%2027-06.pdf), which may reduce their well-being.
1.6.9.1.1.15. Pro: Zoo workers don´t have sufficient formation, or sensibility in animal ethics and that leads to bad misconduct in dealing with animals, as we can see in the [reports](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qwr2zp1jcsbpklm/20150107_usda_ir_tiger_safari_73c0122_nci_002.pdf?dl=0) of Natural Bridge Zoo made by the USDA.
1.6.9.1.1.16. Con: We are [unsure](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/do-animals-feel-pain-in-the-same-way-as-humans-do-10371800.html) if animals are even capable of experiencing emotional pain, which is often the only sort of pain zoos would cause animals.
1.6.9.1.1.16.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.
1.6.9.1.1.16.2. Con: One can easily notice [emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_in_animals) in dogs, cats, apes, dolphins, whales, pigs, cows, birds, etc...sadness often being the easiest to spot.
1.6.9.1.1.16.3. Con: Even if they are not capable of experiencing emotional pain, animals may suffer or are [suffering](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2015/01/ok-va-exotics-investigation-012215.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/) physical pain and injuries or even [death](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/visitors-watch-in-horror-as-donkey-is-fed-to-tigers-alive-in-chinese-zoo/story-R41y6lRdvkWgM9QFiIhKgK.html) because of insufficient funds, inadequate care or incompetent staff. Starving animals, animals with scars because of [beatings](https://www.thedodo.com/bowmanville-tiger-whipping-zoo-closes-1878770250.html) or animals that show no effort or will to live/survive can be seen in many zoos around the world.
1.6.9.1.1.16.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.
1.6.9.1.1.16.3.2. Con: However, the zoo quoted where animals were being beaten was already been"on probation" by Canada's Accredited Zoos and Aquariums \(CAZA\) and finally closed its doors.
1.6.9.1.1.16.4. Con: Well renowned members of the scientific community had this to say on animal consciousness back in 2012. The shorthand is that [animals](http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdfhttp://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf) can experience 'affected states' i.e. moods or 'emotions'.
1.6.9.1.1.16.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.5.
1.6.9.1.1.16.6. Con: The fact that science cannot determine if animals are able to experience emotional pain or be [depressed](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/10/121004-animals-depression-health-science/), does not mean they cannot. For example, animals can display [symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_models_of_depression#Endophenotypes_in_animal_model_of_depression) of depression similar to humans.
1.6.9.1.1.16.7. Con: If we are generally unsure as to the potential harm we might be causing animals, it would be better to err on the side of caution until we can prove our actions cause no harm.
1.6.9.1.1.16.7.1. Pro: If we decide to keep zoos around, the costs of being wrong \(causing thousands of animals unnecessary suffering\) is very high, while the benefits are small. So even if we assign a relatively low probability to animals being able to suffer, we should still avoid causing them suffering.
1.6.9.1.1.17. Pro: If we have a duty not to cause humans suffering then we also have a duty not to cause animals suffering.
1.6.9.1.1.17.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.
1.6.9.1.1.17.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.
1.6.9.1.1.17.3. Con: There is no obligation to prevent human suffering, except where it violates human rights.
1.6.9.1.1.17.3.1. Con: There is no obligation to prevent intangible suffering that one does not cause, for example, suffering caused by systemic poverty or hunger. However, most legislations do prevent people from actively causing suffering to others through physical harm or even verbal abuse.
1.6.9.1.1.17.3.2. Con: This is true, but if we extended analogous rights to animals, the obligation to not-violate-those-rights would likely necessitate an end to zoos.
1.6.9.1.1.17.3.2.1. Pro: The [Right to Participate in the Cultural Life of Community](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/hreduseries/hereandnow/Part-5/8_udhr-abbr.htm) would mean that most social animals need to be allowed to live in groups of their own kind. For larger animals, this requires more space than zoos have available.
1.6.9.1.1.17.3.2.2. Pro: The [Right to Free Movement](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/hreduseries/hereandnow/Part-5/8_udhr-abbr.htm) means zoos could not have boundaries or walls.
1.6.9.1.1.17.4. Con: A responsibly run zoo does not cause animals to suffer.
1.6.9.1.1.17.4.1. Con: Even if a zoo is responsibly run, captivity \(the only way in which zoos can keep animals\) can make them suffer.
1.6.9.1.1.17.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.
1.6.9.1.1.17.4.1.2. Con: Animals don't have the same principled aversion to captivity that humans have, nor do they intrinsically value freedom. A zoo is capable of providing the space, food, and company necessary to keep an animal happy and healthy.
1.6.9.1.1.17.5. Pro: Animals have [the capacity to suffer](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/why-peta/why-animal-rights/) in the same way and to the same degree that humans do. The ability of suffering is a vital characteristic that gives a being the right to equal consideration.
1.6.9.1.1.17.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.4.1.
1.6.9.1.1.17.5.2. Pro: Animals have neurological functions and capacities to generate [consciousness](http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf) and intentional behaviors. Available research concludes that humans are not unique in that regard.
1.6.9.1.1.17.5.3. Con: -> See 1.6.9.1.1.16.
1.6.9.1.1.17.5.4. Pro: Even if animals do not have quite the same capacity to feel pain as humans, this does not mean that their suffering does not matter at all; it just means that their suffering should matter somewhat less to us than the suffering of humans.
1.6.9.1.1.17.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.5.6.
1.6.9.1.1.17.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.5.7.

1.6.9.1.1.18. Con: If zoos did not exist, the animals within them would never come into existence. They would therefore be worse off than if they were brought into existence but experienced some suffering.
1.6.9.1.1.18.1. Con: Nonexistence cannot be meaningfully compared to existence; it therefore cannot be "worse than" existence.
1.6.9.1.1.18.1.1. Pro: The same [principle](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonidentity-problem/) which is applicable to humans can be used for all sentient beings. Bringing forth a being with a flawed existence is morally inferior to bringing into existence nothing at all.
1.6.9.1.1.18.2. Con: This would imply that many forms of obvious animal cruelty are moral; for example, breeding chickens for cockfighting.
1.6.9.1.1.18.3. Con: Some zoo animals are not born in zoos, but are captured from the wild and forced into zoos.
1.6.9.1.1.18.3.1. Con: Most animals in zoos are descendants from animals who were already in [captivity](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/top-misleading-claims-zoos-make/) and most zoos [exchange](http://www.zoosociety.org/About/AcquiringAnimals.php) and barter animals; zoos do not generally [capture](http://zoos.media/zoo-facts/where-do-zoo-animals-come-from/?lang=en) animals from the wild.
1.6.9.1.1.18.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.1.1.2.
1.6.9.1.1.18.3.3. Pro: US zoos [captured](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/us-zoos-secretly-fly-elephants-swaziland-dallas-kansas-nebraska) 18 free elephants from Swaziland, defying a court order, and split the animals in different zoos to be on exhibits as well as use them for breeding purposes.
1.6.9.1.1.18.3.3.1. Con: This situation is rather exceptional: the removal of the animals was carried out to ensure their [wellbeing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/us-zoos-secretly-fly-elephants-swaziland-dallas-kansas-nebraska), as the severe drought in the area could have endangered their lives.
1.6.9.1.1.18.4. Con: This reasoning would lead to absurd conclusions. For example, giving birth to a child and then enslaving them would be morally acceptable, since the child would be worse off if they never came into existence.
1.6.9.1.1.18.4.1. Con: Humans have rights, like the right not to be enslaved; animals do not. So it is consistent to apply this reasoning to animals, but not to humans.
1.6.9.1.1.18.4.1.1. Con: Humans have rights because society has agreed that sentient beings with interests deserve to be treated with respect. Sentient animals should be treated no differently.
1.6.9.1.1.18.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.1.

1.6.9.1.1.18.5. Pro: Even if it is true that animals suffer in captivity, they undeniably gain some enjoyment \(e.g. through bonding with other animals or [with human zookeepers](http://www.denverpost.com/2012/05/25/at-denver-zoo-human-animal-bond-is-heart-of-success/)\) from their existence.
1.6.9.1.1.18.6. Con: It is not in the interest of any animal population to be bred simply to suffer for the sake of humankind.
1.6.9.1.1.18.6.1. Con: The relevant consideration is not the wellbeing of a "population," but the wellbeing of the individual animals in zoos.
1.6.9.1.1.18.6.2. Con: This is dependent on the ethical framework used; a utilitarian would quite possibly support the harm to the individual animals if it benefitted the species as a whole.
1.6.9.1.1.19. Con: -> See 1.6.2.5.
1.6.9.1.1.20. Con: Both accredited and unaccredited animal exhibitors are regulated by the federal [Animal Welfare Act,](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2009-title7/html/USCODE-2009-title7-chap54.htm) which establishes standards for care.
1.6.9.1.1.20.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.6.
1.6.9.1.1.21. Pro: Zoos prioritise human enjoyment over animal suffering.
1.6.9.1.1.21.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.5.3.
1.6.9.1.1.21.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.

1.6.9.1.1.21.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.9.1.1.11.
1.6.9.1.1.22. Pro: Zoos face a risk of falling attendance, as has happened with many other traditional venues of human entertainment, such as [performance arts](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-decline-of-the-audience/), [museums](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2017/feb/02/drop-uk-museum-attendance) and [theatres](http://www.businessinsider.com/movie-theater-attendance-is-declining-as-cord-cutting-becomes-more-popular-2016-9). Zoos might make changes at the expense of animal well-being in order to adjust in cases of dropping attendance rates.
1.6.9.1.1.22.1. Pro: This could mean cutting resources spent on maintaining habitats, general animal care or buying decent animal food.
1.6.9.1.1.22.2. Pro: This could mean having more animal shows, forcing animals to do tricks in order to bring up the entertainment value.
1.6.9.1.1.22.3. Con: In the case of [Toronto Zoo's](https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2016/03/12/toronto-zoo-forced-to-adapt-to-survive-as-attendance-falls.html) declining attendance numbers, the opposite happened. Instead of efforts that would improve attendance rates at the expense of animal well-being, the zoo invested in conservation programs.
1.6.9.1.1.22.3.1. Con: While officials at Toronto Zoo talk about investing in conservation programs, it is arguable that being able to house more “[baby animals](http://www.metronews.ca/news/toronto/2017/02/28/toronto-zoo-attendance-increase-2016-panda-cubs.html)” is the reason why the zoo has managed to boost attendance, even if its balances are still negative.
1.6.9.1.1.22.4. Con: One of the reasons for this risk is likely a more progressive stance toward animal rights. It is unlikely that responding with more animal cruelty would thus help.
1.6.9.1.1.22.4.1. Pro: For example, citizens and celebrities [campaigned](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/19/la-zoos-elephant-billy-lawsuit_n_1609365.html) and backed a lawsuit that demanded the LA Zoo elephant exhibit to close and Billy, a depressed and sexually frustrated elephant, to be moved to a sanctuary.
1.6.9.1.1.22.4.1.1. Pro: Even though activists were not successful in closing the exhibit, the lawsuit required the zoo to improve the treatment of its elephants and the LA City Council invested $42 million in an expansion. In 2017, a Councilman has again proposed a motion to move the elephants to a [sanctuary](https://patch.com/california/northhollywood/councilman-claims-billy-elephant-suffers-under-treatment-la-zoo).
1.6.9.1.1.22.5. Con: There is no hard evidence to suggest zoos are experiencing a general decline in visitors. In the US zoos received 62 million visitors in 2015 and the figures have slightly [increased](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/23/sanctuaries-or-showbiz-zoos-struggle-to-balance-conservation-and-entertainment) during the last decade.
1.6.9.1.1.22.5.1. Pro: The Smithsonian National Zoo has had a steady number of visitors \(ranging from 2 million to 2.7 million\) in the last [decade](http://newsdesk.si.edu/about/stats).
1.6.9.1.1.22.5.2. Con: The risk exists even if zoos are not currently experiencing a general decline in visitors. If new technology creating similar circumstances to the experience attending zoos emerges, then zoos might lose their visitors, just as happened with movies, music and art.
1.6.9.1.1.22.5.2.1. Con: The experience of witnessing animals at close distances can be more difficult to replicate with new technologies than admiring art, listening to music or watching movies.
1.6.9.1.1.22.5.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.
1.6.9.1.1.23. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.1.
1.6.9.1.1.24. Con: The suffering of a few animals can be justified if it saves many more animals from suffering. Zoos can be ethical by doing work which benefits animals.
1.6.9.1.1.24.1. Con: Humans do not recognize the idea of harming a few for the benefit of many as an acceptable justification for acts that harm other individuals. If it is not an acceptable excuse to hurt humans, it is not an acceptable excuse to hurt animals.
1.6.9.1.1.24.1.1. Con: Humans do not have a collectively agreed upon set of morals. That is why we have a vast range of religions and belief systems.
1.6.9.1.1.24.2. Pro: Zoos help more animals than they hurt.
1.6.9.1.1.24.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.

1.6.9.1.1.24.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.
1.6.9.2. Pro: Even insofar as animal rights exist, they should not extend to higher-order rights which are associated with human socialisation and civilisation.
1.6.9.3. Con: The right to freedom of movement arises because movement is an integral part of a human's ability to self-actualise and live life properly. The same is true for animals.
1.6.9.3.1. Con: Animals have no concept of self-actualisation, flourishing, or living life well. As such, the ability to live natural lives is not as important for animals.
1.6.9.3.1.1. Con: Animals self-actualize through fulfilling their natural roles such as breeding and raising their offspring.
1.6.9.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.2.13.3.1.
1.6.9.3.3. Con: Humans are not granted absolute freedom of movement under the status quo. For example, the existence of borders is an explicit restriction of this freedom.
1.6.9.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.6.9.4. Pro: Higher-order rights arise through complex social frameworks of reciprocity and obligation. These do not exist for animals.

1.6.9.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.5.1.
1.6.9.5. Pro: Humans possess higher-order rights because they possess [rational autonomy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/autonomy-moral/). This requires a cognitive sophistication and level of rationality that animals lack.
1.6.9.5.1. Con: "Rationality" is not a dichotomous concept. It exists on a spectrum, and there is no specific level at which a creature achieves "rational autonomy."
1.6.9.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.

1.6.9.6. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.6.10. Con: Animals weak enough to be confined by humans do not have an innate right to be free from humans. Humans are not separate from nature. We came from it and use it, so zoos are part of nature and should not be disturbed.

1.7. Pro: Zoos are a source of unnecessary [pollution](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2590/1cf4060a598791905e9301c13902b23fb61b.pdf).
1.7.1. Pro: Animals in zoos, such as [camelids](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3981797/) and [kangaroos](http://file:///C:/Users/apaul/Downloads/ScienceNordic%20-%20Disappointed%20scientists_%20damn,%20kangaroos%20fart%20methane%20-%202012-06-11.pdf) are a source of methane, which is one of the causes for [climate change.](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/briefings/Short_Lived_Promise.pdf)
1.7.1.1. Con: The quantity of methane produced by the animals in a zoo is too low to affect climate change in any way. To put this into persecpecive,animal farms have at least 70 bilion animals, while all zoos in the world bearly reach 1 milion \(many of them are small animals\)
1.7.2. Pro: It is impossible to cover the [ecological footprint](https://www.uea.ac.uk/documents/541248/10799665/Wang+Xiaozhou+Dissertation.pdf/ae0db754-514e-4202-9499-d0127b86795a) for all of WAZA \(World association of zoo and aquarium\) member zoos, since the number of zoos that provide feedback of their data related to energy consumption is limited.
1.8. Pro: Zoos are unealthy for some animals.
1.8.1. Pro: [Obesity](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322022574_Adiposity_and_Reproductive_Cycling_Status_in_Zoo_African_Elephants_Elephant_Body_Composition_and_Cyclicity_Status) affects about 40 percent of North American zoo African elephants in captivity, based on a body condition score \(BCS\).
1.8.2. Pro: The [captive rattlesnakes](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rsbmt/v20n1/04.pdf) show a relatively high incidence of bacterial contamination of their venom than wild snakes.
1.8.3. Pro: The occurrence and severity of calculus buildup and periodontal disease is [significantly higher](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528816301151) in captive felids compared to their wild counterparts.
1.8.4. Pro: The zoo's environment often present in urban settings affects wildlife, allowing initially free-living animals to be exposed to [leptospires](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003452881630741X), mainly of rodent origin, such as Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus.
1.8.5. Pro: Toxoplasma gondii is protozoan parasite with ability of causing disease in wide-spectrum of animals; many species of animals in captivity die of clinical [toxoplasmosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X17313967).
1.8.6. Pro: [Lameness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/sdfe/pdf/download/eid/3-s2.0-B9780323552288000886/first-page-pdf) is a common health problem of adult giraffe \(Giraffa spp.\) at many zoos. Up to 80% of giraffe immobilizations are done to address hoof overgrowth and limping, indicating that lameness is an important health problem for this species.
1.8.7. Pro: Considerable ammount of [heavy metals](https://www.ijirset.com/upload/june/40A_FECES.pdf) are found in wild mammals feces in zoos that have proximity with high traffic densities.
1.9. Pro: Zoos can be a source of animals for the [black market](https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/wildlife/WLC16_Chapter_8.pdf).
1.9.1. Pro: The [exotic pet trade](http://cardinalscholar.bsu.edu/bitstream/handle/123456789/200122/A371_2015RichardsonJennifer.pdf;sequence=1), which is highly unregulated, is a multi-billion dollar industry, second only to drugs and weapons on the black market
1.9.2. Pro: "National scale trade bans are followed by an increase in the illegal trade of the species at hand, which suggests an inverse relationship between the legal and [illegal trade](http://biodiversity.tamu.edu/files/2012/08/ABS_Perspectives-1_3_Santos_etal.pdf)"
1.9.2.1. Pro: In Uganda, capturing young gorillas for zoos is still occurring in the distribution range of the [Eastern Gorilla](https://www.traffic.org/site/assets/files/8460/uganda_wildlife_assessment.pdf), despite the international commercial trade ban in gorillas.
1.9.3. Pro: [Wild Tigers](https://www.traffic.org/site/assets/files/4016/nowhere_to_hide.pdf) are offered for sale to zoos
1.9.3.1. Pro: The [ZAA opposes](http://media.cleveland.com/metro/other/ZAA%20Exemption%20Weakens%20Bills_Factsheet.pdf) a regulation proposed by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service that would provide an important monitoring tool to help prevent captive tigers in the U.S. from fueling the illegal black market for tiger parts.
1.9.4. Pro: Orangutans and chimpanzees in particular are sold to disreputable amusement parks, [zoos](https://mobil.wwf.de/fileadmin/fm-wwf/Publikationen-PDF/WWF_Poaching_and_illegal_Wildlife_Trade.pdf) or other facilities.
1.9.5. Pro: In Brazil, animal traffickers have four markets, the first market being collectors and [private zoos](https://www.ibama.gov.br/sophia/cnia/periodico/effortstocombatwildanimalstraffick.pdf). These private zoos hold illegally extracted animals, though having government authorization to operate.
1.9.6. Pro: In Brazil [“Animal laundering”](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/itgg.2006.1.2.25) is a reality through zoos or so-called scientific, conservationist, or commercial breeding grounds which provide false certificates claiming that animals were born in captivity.
1.9.7. Pro: Zoos are associated to the [trophy hunting](http://www.fao.org/docrep/pdf/010/aj114e/aj114e.pdf) blackmarket. Trophy specimens from breeding centres are marketed to hunters and zoos.
1.9.7.1. Pro: Hunters aim rare species that have been bred in captivity for the very purpose of being hunted upon reaching adulthood \(having first been used in [petting zoos](https://www.animallaw.info/sites/default/files/Trophy%20Hunting%20Contracts%20Unenforceable%20for%20Reasons%20of%20Public%20Policy.pdf) while young\)
1.9.8. Con: The existence of a black market implies there is an interest that needs to be countered with providing socially responsible legal alternatives. Both to satisfy people's curiosity and to provide a forum for education. Shutting down zoos will encourage more cruel underground alternatives.
1.10. Pro: -> See 1.6.9.1.1.
1.11. Con: People enjoy going to zoos, so they should be allowed to continue to do so.
1.11.1. Con: The benefits to humans are irrelevant if, in the process of providing those benefits, zoos violate animal rights.
1.11.1.1. Pro: We generally believe that it is unacceptable to override people's rights in order to make other people happier. The same principle should apply to the rights of animals.
1.11.1.1.1. Con: We consider all humans to be equals, however we generally do not believe that animals are equal to humans. This means that overriding the rights of animals is less unacceptable.
1.11.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.2.1.
1.11.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.
1.11.1.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.
1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.1.3.
1.11.3. Con: Human enjoyment is not a justification for particularly cruel practices.
1.11.3.1. Pro: Dog and cock fighting are almost [universally outlawed](https://www.animallaw.info/article/chart-state-dogfighting-laws).
1.11.3.1.1. Con: The harm caused to animals in zoos is permissible as it is not the [intended effect](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/double-effect/) of the zoos. This is different from cock and dog fighting where people derive pleasure because of the animal's pain; this sort of pleasure is sadistic and immoral.
1.11.3.1.1.1. Con: Although harm to animals is not the explicit purpose of zoos, harm to animals is inherent to the concept of a zoo, so zoos are still unjust institutions.
1.11.3.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.2.
1.11.3.1.1.2. Con: Similarly, it is not the primary intention of circuses to harm their animals. Yet animal circus shows are nevertheless being banned because of the resulting cruelty and harm to animals.
1.11.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: In 2016, The Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus [retired](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ringling-bros-elephants-retired_us_572733f3e4b0f309baf13cf5) their elephants from performing in their circus acts.
1.11.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.3.2.
1.11.3.1.1.2.3. Pro: UK circus also have licenses to use animals in accordance with the Welfare of Animals in Travelling Circuses \(England\) Regulations 2012. This are done accordingly with the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Reports indicates that captive wild animals in travelling circuses and [mobile zoos](http://www.academia.edu/28471968/The_welfare_of_wild_animals_in_travelling_circuses) do not achieve their optimal welfare requirements.
1.11.3.2. Pro: People can enjoy murder, but that doesn't justify it.
1.11.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.1.3.2.
1.11.3.3. Con: Enjoyment, justification, and cruelty, are all subjective ideas.
1.11.3.3.1. Con: [Enjoyment](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/research&labs/berridge/publications/BerridgeBrain&Coginpress\(Pleasure\).pdf) is a reaction to a certain experience and a product of the brain, but it is not an idea.
1.11.3.3.2. Con: [Animal cruelty](https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/the-3rs) is objective. In animal ethics committee it is used the 3rs principle to avoid the suffering of animals. The 3rs principle is used in many company models, including in recycling, as well in ecology, and ultimately in zoos. Only a few [zoos](https://biol420eres525.wordpress.com/tag/zoos/) follow these 3 principles of ecology: Reservation, Restoration & Reconciliation, as a consequence of the visitors awareness of their bad animal treatment and the bad ticket selling.
1.11.3.3.3. Con: Sometimes humans need [justification](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4585257/) to act, or else they would be only emotional animals acting based on instinct.
1.11.3.4. Pro: The benefit of human entertainment does not outweigh the harm caused by the animals' suffering.
1.11.4. Pro: Keeping animals in zoos serves educational and entertainment purposes to the humans. These are more important than the impacts zoos have on animals.
1.11.4.1. Con: Many alternatives exist to visiting zoos: other forms of entertainment, watching nature documentaries, and so forth.
1.11.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.11.4.2. Con: Zoos modify animal behavior because the environment is not a natural one for the animals. The amount that can be gleaned from observing animals in captivity is thereby limited. Furthermore people are far more eager and pay more to see animals in the wild than in captivity.
1.11.4.3. Pro: Zoos allow humans to reconnect with their natural prehistoric habitats.
1.11.4.4. Con: Considering human purposes as more important than animals' integrity is just the same justification that furtive hunters use.
1.11.4.5. Con: Zoos are the perfect example of how people disregard the well-being of anything on the planet but themselves.
1.11.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.
1.11.6. Pro: Zoos are a safe environment for humans to marvel at the beauty of nature.
1.11.7. Pro: God put animals on this planet for our enjoyment according to the Bible.
1.11.7.1. Con: -> See 1.6.6.3.
1.11.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.6.4.
1.11.7.3. Con: "Attitudes to animals in Christian thought must first be understood in the context of the pastoralist culture in which they arose" - [Rod Preece and David Fraser](http://www.animalsandsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/preece.pdf).
1.11.8. Con: Most of the people who see zoos or dolphinariums as a form of attractions are not [aware](http://www.blackfishmovie.com/film/#about) of the fact that to keep animals calm and peaceful they are fed with all [kind](https://www.animalsaustralia.org/features/things-we-need-to-stop-telling-ourselves-about-zoos.php) of [drugs](https://networkforanimals.org/newsletter-page/drugged-zoo-animals-tormented-by-tourists/).
1.11.8.1. Pro: Dolphins deserve freedom as they're highly [sentient](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b479/e0afc07806486be1a11c8d37efbf2065458d.pdf) beings.
1.11.8.1.1. Pro: Dolphins have [conscious awareness](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.694.374&rep=rep1&type=pdf) of its own body and body parts, implying a representational ‘‘body image’’ system.
1.11.8.1.1.1. Pro: Dolphins exhibit [self-awareness](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0189813&type=printable) at a mirror at a younger age than previously reported for children or other species tested.
1.11.8.1.2. Pro: The complex and stable vocal, and behavioral cultures of large brain delphinids, shows they have [complex cognition](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b479/e0afc07806486be1a11c8d37efbf2065458d.pdf).
1.11.8.1.2.1. Pro: The evolutionary size [increase of the cerebral cortex](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232025271_The_size_and_complexity_of_dolphin_brains_-_A_paradox) in dolphins facilitate highly cognitive capabilities as well as precise and rapid sound processing using a ‘simple’ kind of neocortical cytoarchitecture.
1.11.9. Con: Even if people derive substantial pleasure from visiting zoos, the marginal pleasure gained when compared to the alternatives - for example, going to a movie or on a hike - is probably very low.
1.11.9.1. Pro: It is possible identify more wild species on a hike with a [book](https://www.lfwseq.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LFW-Note-2016_A1.pdf) than in a zoo, and it allows us to be healthy at the same time.
1.11.9.1.1. Pro: Zoos tend to pick animals that visitors like and they choose always the same species because it´s more profitable. That´s why they select the ambassadors species in detriment of others species.
1.11.9.1.1.1. Pro: Zoos selects abassadors according to a group of [criteria](https://www.speakcdn.com/assets/2332/ambassador_animal_evaluation_tool.pdf) that turns some species unfavoured from being selected.
1.11.9.1.2. Pro: Hiking can be easily made by schools to improve [local biodiversity](https://www.ontarioecoschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Biodiversity_Factsheet.pdf).
1.11.9.2. Pro: Zoos don´t have sufficient space to provide the same ammount of contact with species that the natural habitat have. Zoos can´t have certain species because of the lack space problem. [www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1558787807002353)
1.11.9.3. Pro: Zoos have problems with animals that go in captivity like this study with deers shows. [www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225979575_Comparing_life_expectancy_of_three_deer_species_between_captive_and_wild_populations)
1.11.9.4. Pro: There are health risks for humans in going to zoos. [secure.mediapeta.com](https://secure.mediapeta.com/peta/PDF/PettingZooFactsheet.pdf)
1.11.9.4.1. Pro: 50% of people who come into regular contact with different species of marine mammals had suffered an injury and 23% had a skin rash or reaction as a result of that, according to a [study.](https://www.bornfree.org.uk/storage/media/content/files/Publications/EU%20DOLPHINARIA%20REPORT.pdf)
1.11.9.4.2. Pro: Petting zoos have been linked with numerous [outbreaks](https://www.wormsandgermsblog.com/files/2008/04/JSW-MA2-Pet-Zoo1.pdf) of diseases such as E. coli, cryptosporidiosis, salmonellosis and dermatomycosis \(ringworm\)
1.11.9.5. Pro: There are benefits of hiking, for mental and physical health. [www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281619759_Hiking_as_Mental_and_Physical_Experience)
1.12. Con: Zoos are not sufficiently harmful to warrant governmental imposition on freedom of choice.
1.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.5.
1.12.2. Con: Imposition on people's freedom to support an unjust institution is perfectly acceptable, and not something we should seek to avoid.
1.12.2.1. Pro: Our right to freedom of choice is relative. Impositions on our freedom of choice need to be weighed up against other factors such as our access to alternatives.
1.12.2.1.1. Pro: If a movie theatre shows only one movie, banning people from watching that movie is very bad. If it shows 20, banning people from watching one of them is not as bad. This shows that the moral wrongness of restrictions on choice is proportionate to the availability of alternatives.
1.12.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.4.1.
1.12.2.2. Con: Institutions cannot be just or unjust. Only people, through their actions, can be unjust.
1.12.2.2.1. Con: When people though their actions create rules, conditions and behaviours within institutions that are unjust, those institutions can be seen as unjust.
1.12.3. Con: Animal suffering has long been used as a legitimate metric for justifying government intervention.
1.12.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.1.
1.12.3.2. Con: Such intervention has always been based on a continuum of suffering. Any amount of suffering does not justify full infringement of freedoms.
1.12.3.3. Pro: Organizations like the [Humane Society International](http://www.hsi.org/?referrer=https://www.google.com/) is built on protecting animals from unnecessary suffering. Local governments are often called on to assist in bringing about change in this area.
1.12.3.4. Con: [Many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_zoos_in_the_United_States) zoos are government-run.
1.12.3.4.1. Con: Across the US, only [one third](https://reason.org/commentary/zoo-privatization-2011/) of zoos or government-run and some are considering privatization.
1.12.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.
1.12.5. Pro: From a nihilistic standpoint, forbidding zoos has no potential benefit.
1.12.5.1. Con: From a nihilistic standpoint, maintaining zoos has no potential benefit.
1.12.6. Con: Freedom of choice for the animals is revoked once placed into zoos. If freedom of choice trumps sufficient harm in this argument, but that is the very thing being removed from these creatures, then is point is rendered invalid.
1.12.6.1. Con: Animals are of less moral significance than humans, so their freedom of choice matters less.
1.12.7. Pro: To ban a zoo is a political action. If the zoo fails on its own, then the market has spoken. Let the market decide by allowing those who visit the zoo pay for the costs associated with having and maintaining a zoo. All zoos need to be held to high standards for treatment.
1.12.8. Con: There are several [dangers](http://www.writing.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.writ.d7/files/sitefiles/publications/2011_Yan.pdf) to animals which are common in zoos. Almost all animals in zoos suffers long-term emotional, psychological, or physical trauma.
1.12.8.1. Pro: [Visual contact](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159115000908) from zoo visitors can be harmful to animals.
1.12.8.2. Pro: Zoos can expose animals to certain [health risks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044516913000191), derivative from parasites.
1.12.9. Con: Laws are done accordingly within a specific culture, or ethics. What is consider harmful for a country could be unconsidered in another country, or state. Example: In Australia it is forbidden to spit in the ground \(can be considered a [public offense](https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/is-spitting-a-crime-in-nsw/)\), in Spain it is not sufficiently harmful. Therefore, on one hand your statement is subjective. On the other hand the ethic values are changing everywhere and that can mean different government impositions with new made laws.
1.12.10. Pro: We already treat animals poorly in a number of ways. There is no reason why zoos should be different.
1.12.10.1. Pro: The majority of people eat meat which requires us to kill animals.
1.12.10.1.1. Pro: The slaughter and inhumane treatment of livestock is widespread.
1.12.10.1.2. Pro: Even the consumption of non-meat products like eggs depends on farming practices which cause animals [considerable suffering](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/factory-farming/chickens/egg-industry/).
1.12.10.2. Con: We should not treat animals poorly in these other ways either.
1.12.10.3. Pro: We already keep domestic pets which is not dissimilar to keeping animals in zoos.
1.12.10.3.1. Pro: Tropical birds as pets are often kept in cages for their entire life. This is the same as being in captivity at a zoo.
1.12.10.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.8.4.2.2.2.1.3.3.4.
1.12.10.3.3. Pro: Cows, chickens, and pigs will never be endangered. One thing these animals have in common is that it is legal to have them as pets and as sustenance. However, Rhinos, Elephants, and Tigers will. What these endangered animals have in common is that it is illegal to have them serve as pets or sustenance. Zoos don't even slaughter animals and keep them alive.
1.12.10.3.4. Con: Domestic species, as the name suggests, are different in nature to the sorts of wild animals that are kept in zoos.
1.12.10.3.4.1. Con: Domesticated animals are bred in ways that are often [incredibly harmful](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3799981/Think-twice-getting-bulldogs-pugs-Vets-say-demand-flat-faced-canines-damage-health.html) to their health.
1.12.10.3.4.1.1. Pro: Selective breeding to create [purebred](http://www.instituteofcaninebiology.org/blog/health-of-purebred-vs-mixed-breed-dogs-the-data) dogs for human enjoyment also makes them more prone to genetic diseases.
1.12.10.3.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.
1.12.10.3.4.3. Pro: [Generations of breeding by humans](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/Supplement_1/9971.full) has made domestic animals more amenable to living alongside humans.
1.12.10.3.5. Con: Domestic pets are often far better treated than animals at zoos, since they receive frequent attention, and more active ones \(like dogs and cats\) are allowed to roam outside.
1.12.10.3.5.1. Pro: We would never allow our pets to live in small, unnatural enclosures so why do it to 'wild' animals?
1.12.10.4. Pro: If zoos are banned due to animals being unlawfully penned up outside of their natural habitat, then industrial farming would soon be made illegal for penning up animals in tight spaces outside of their natural habitat.
1.12.10.4.1. Pro: Creating laws that are strict enough to ban zoos due to transgressions against animal rights would expose the meat industry to similar critique. A simple argument of comparison would liken the meat industry's alleged misconduct to that of zoos. This would effectively dismantle the meat industry under the law and lead to effects mentioned above.
1.12.10.4.2. Pro: The dismantlement of the meat industry and industrial farms under the same reasoning of animal rights would take away a large portion of [food from the world](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100615/4-countries-produce-most-food.asp). This would entail more detrimental repercussions than benefits.
1.12.10.5. Con: The degree of utility humans gain from other interactions with animals \(e.g. pet-keeping, meat-eating\) is far greater than the marginal enjoyment that zoos provide.
1.12.10.5.1. Con: Pet ownership is merely a private zoo. The animals are not in their native environment.
1.12.10.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.10.3.
1.12.10.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.
1.12.10.5.1.3. Con: There are several species that have been domesticated for human companionship, and thus are not native to any wild environment.
1.12.10.5.1.3.1. Pro: Although [dogs](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/d/domestic-dog/) are related to several wild dog species, they are not native to and would never survive in the wild.
1.12.10.5.2. Pro: Given that the enjoyment humans gain from zoos is marginal, they are an ideal starting point for the introduction of stricter animal rights protections.
1.12.10.5.3. Con: The pleasure humans gain from eating meat, as opposed to other forms of food, is marginal.
1.12.10.5.3.1. Con: For many people, meat is a key component of their diet.
1.12.10.5.3.1.1. Con: Those people could live equally healthy and satisfying lives, eating substitutes instead of meat. Having meat be a key component of one's diet is not a necessity.
1.12.10.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: Eating vegan [options](https://www.learnvest.com/knowledge-center/do-vegetarians-save-money/#pid-2775_aint-0) can be cheaper than eating meat.
1.12.10.5.3.2. Con: Many parts of the world are [economically](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160926-what-would-happen-if-the-world-suddenly-went-vegetarian) dependent on meat-producing industries.
1.12.10.5.3.3. Pro: Moreover, a massive amount of edible food \(e.g. soy or grain\) is used to feed animals while [humans](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/five-things-would-happen-if-everyone-stopped-eating-meat-a6844811.html) do not have enough to eat. Decreasing meat consumption is, therefore, more useful and [beneficial](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cutting-back-on-meat-consumption-could-help-end-hunger-by-2030-experts_us_55f3424ee4b077ca094f27a5).
1.12.10.5.3.3.1. Con: Because of the food industry, millions of animals are bred into existence that would not have lived otherwise. An existence with experiences of some happiness and some pain is better than no existence at all.
1.12.10.5.3.4. Con: Eating meat has cultural [significance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Adha) for many people.
1.12.10.6. Pro: In laboratories, animals are tortured and die as a result of chemical testing.
1.12.10.6.1. Con: Laboratory testing kills animals to better the lives of humanity.
1.12.10.7. Con: If we can do the same thing that treats an animal poorly but without treating them poorly, there is no reason why we should continue to treat animals poorly.
1.12.10.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.5.11.
1.12.11. Pro: If individuals truly believed zoos were immoral, they would boycott them, and deny them the revenue they need to continue existing.
1.12.11.1. Con: It is the duty of the government to recognize the immorality of zoos, not individuals.
1.12.11.1.1. Pro: A civilized country does not allow the insensitivity of its population to take rights away from vulnerable groups.
1.12.11.1.2. Pro: The attitudes of individuals have no relevance to the true morality or immorality of zoos. Governments should therefore not leave the matter up to their populations.
1.12.11.1.2.1. Con: The only method we have of evaluating moral claims is by investigating our moral intuitions. The moral intuitions of very many people are therefore important in determining whether we think a moral claim is true or false.
1.12.11.1.2.1.1. Con: The scientific method is an approach that humans have agreed upon to use to verify the truth or falsehood of propositions, based on shared empirical experiences. Such a system can equally exist for morality which would be no less falsifiable.
1.12.11.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The scientific method is objective. Moral beliefs are relative. Therefore, morality is not verifiable in the same way the scientific method is.
1.12.11.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Morals differ by individual, clique, national culture, time, and socio-economic status within a culture.
1.12.11.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: The scientific method cannot be objective as it is created and deployed by beings - humans - who're incapable of knowing what is objective truth.
1.12.11.1.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The scientific method requires replication of results, preferably by a large number and variety of sources. It is objective in the sense that it is impartial.
1.12.11.1.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.12.11.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.12.11.1.2.2. Con: Laws made by the government are interpreted by the judiciary, which may make a decision based on what is permissible to a "[reasonable man](http://people.hss.caltech.edu/~alan/ReasonableMan.pdf)". This means that governments necessarily leave all matters of law up to their populations to some degree.
1.12.11.1.3. Con: Democratic governments derive their legitimacy from \(the votes of\) individuals. Representing the will of the electorate is the duty of an elected government.
1.12.11.2. Pro: This sort of consumer driven regulation is superior to government intervention because it is more specific, allowing only zoos which engage in problematic practices to be targeted.
1.12.11.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.
1.12.11.2.2. Con: Due to the very high fixed costs of establishing a zoo, the market for zoos is not very competitive, so consumer pressure would not be an effective mechanism to encourage zoos to improve their practices.
1.12.11.2.2.1. Con: While the costs of establishing a new zoo are high, the costs of changing practices in an existing zoo to be more ethical are low. Consumer pressure could therefore successfully change the behaviour of zoos.
1.12.11.2.2.1.1. Con: If changing these zoos required the total reconstruction of enclosures to make them more ethical then the costs are likely to remain high.
1.12.11.2.2.1.2. Con: [Toronto Zoo](https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2016/03/12/toronto-zoo-forced-to-adapt-to-survive-as-attendance-falls.html)'s changes to be more ethical were incredibly expensive and it is still uncertain whether or not it will help to deal with their decline in attendance.
1.12.11.2.2.2. Pro: Individuals may conclude that their individual decision to boycott a zoo will not have any concrete impact on the zoo's practices, so they may as well attend. In this way, nothing will change.
1.12.11.3. Pro: The level of support for animal rights is not sufficient to ensure effective boycotts. This indicates that people do not believe that zoos are immoral.
1.12.11.3.1. Pro: In the US, [only 32%](http://www.gallup.com/poll/183275/say-animals-rights-people.aspx) of people believe that animals should enjoy similar rights to humans.
1.12.11.3.1.1. Con: This percentage is up 25% from 2008, showing a substantial increase in the belief that animals should have similar rights to humans. It is likely this upward trend will continue.
1.12.11.3.2. Con: Large numbers of people support stronger laws protecting animals. For example, [80% of Canadians and 70% of South Koreans](http://www.hsi.org/news/news/2016/01/global_cosmetics_polling_012716.html?referrer=https://www.google.co.nz/) favour a ban on cosmetics testing on animals.
1.12.11.3.2.1. Con: Cosmetic testing on animals is harmful and unnecessary, so the opposition is understandable. By contrast, the harms of zoos are unclear while their benefits are apparent. Public opinion on cosmetic testing does not necessarily generalize to zoos.
1.12.11.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.12.11.3.2.1.2. Pro: Cosmetic testing on humans would be more effective as animals may react differently from humans to some substances.
1.12.11.3.2.1.3. Pro: Cosmetic testing on humans would be more ethical as it requires consent from the test subjects.
1.12.11.3.3. Con: If anything, this speaks to a need to focus political capital on specific cruel practices at specific zoos in order to get the public on board.
1.12.11.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.4.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.2.1.5.1.3.2.2.1.
1.12.11.3.3.2. Pro: Drawing the public's attention to specific instances of animal abuse could effectively raise general support for animal rights.
1.12.11.3.4. Pro: Even among those who do believe in animal rights, this belief may not be enough to stop them going to zoos.
1.12.11.3.4.1. Pro: The [level of vegetarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country) in countries is typically much lower than the level of people who believe abstractly in some form of animal rights. This shows that belief does not necessarily motivate action.
1.12.11.3.4.2. Pro: It is plausible that many people who believe in animal rights, would find that there is nothing wrong with zoos because of the good that many zoos do for animals.
1.12.11.3.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.12.11.4. Con: Just because people don't believe something is immoral doesn't mean it isn't. People in the deep South didn't believe slavery was immoral, yet it actually was. Ethical standards should be determined by value for freedom, not majority rule.
1.12.11.5. Pro: For example, backlash against SeaWorld in the aftermath of the documentary 'Blackfish' [saw their profits fall by 84%](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/06/seaworld-profits-plunge-customers).
1.12.11.5.1. Con: However, some years after the documentary and the [cease](http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-seaworld-ceo-joel-manby-interview-20160418-story.html) of breeding orcas, SeaWorld is starting to economically [recover](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandindex/2014/04/24/sea-world-begins-recovery-post-blackfish-documentary/#2f7ff75318c0).
1.13. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.7.1.
