1.2.2. Pro: It takes time, and effort, but with guidance and perseverance creativity can at least be fostered.

1.3. Con: Rather than wasting time on teaching creativity, we should focus on training students in core maths, science, and communication skills.
1.3.1. Con: Of all things robots could replace, practical skills is top of the list; creativity is what sets humans apart.
1.3.2. Con: High-level maths, science and communication requires a degree of creativity to mould those skills to the context they're required in; creativity cannot be so easily cast aside.
1.4. Pro: As AI and robots take on more and more traditionally human job roles, the one thing computers can not currently do is imitate human creativity.
1.4.1. Con: It is only a matter of time before they can, or at least approximate it.
1.4.2. Pro: Although AI can imitate many human activities and traits, creativity is an emergent property resulting from our biology.
1.4.2.1. Con: [Computational creativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_creativity) is also an emerging property. With the fast progresses in the field of Artificial Intelligence, they could catch up with Human's creativity levels.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: Computer intelligence is emergent from a different system than human intelligence. Artificial Intelligence implies that it will be artificial "human" intelligence, but, more likely, computer intelligence will be alien to humans.  As a result, if computers are "creative" it will be in a different and alien way from human creativity.
1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.6. Con: Eventually, computers will replace even human creativity.
1.6.1. Pro: Artificial Intelligence is unlimited, thus it will eventually be indistinguishable from human intelligence.
1.6.2. Con: Yes, but comparatively speaking, this will be the last skill AIs will probably learn and will thus ensure that you have a job for the longest possible time. As such, creativity is still one of the most important skills for the 21st Century.
