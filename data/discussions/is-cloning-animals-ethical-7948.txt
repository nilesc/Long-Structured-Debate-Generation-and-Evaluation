Discussion Title: Is Cloning Animals Ethical?

1. Cloning animals is ethical
1.1. Con: Cloning can not be considered ethical without complete knowledge of the first, second, and third order consequences, which are unknown.
1.1.1. Con: To learn consequences of cloning we need to perform it first.
1.1.1.1. Pro: All innovation has unforeseeable consequences.
1.1.2. Con: Cloning cannot be considered unethical as well, for the same reason.
1.1.3. Con: We often make medical \(and non-medical\) ethical decisions when we cannot know all the consequences.
1.2. Con: Cloning animals is intervening in natural processes, which we shouldn't be doing.
1.2.1. Con: Humans are part of nature, our "interference" is every bit as natural as anything else.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Humans already intervene in nature in modern society in many ways such as performing surgery for example.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Many advents of science and technology, like surgical procedures is altering nature to a certain extent but nobody complains about it because lives are saved. The same can be true if we advance in cloning experiments.
1.2.1.2. Pro: The naturalistic fallacy states that what is "natural" isn't necessarily "better".
1.2.2. Con: Cloning is just an advanced type of selective breeding, the involvement of technology does not create an ethical differentiation between the two.
1.2.2.1. Con: There is some [argument](https://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/AnimalCloning/ucm055512.htm#Myth6) over whether certain tissues in clones are "older" \(shorter telomeres may mean a shorter lifespan of the tissue\), based on the age of the DNA donor.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: With gene editing this could be circumvented.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Humans have been using selective breeding for hundreds of years, dating back to the Aztecs selectively breeding maize.
1.2.3. Pro: God created animals, and cloning them is intervening in his creation, which is immoral.
1.2.3.1. Con: Humans already intervene in God's creation \(nature\) in various ways. We do not see those as immoral.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: [Faith based parents refuse medical care for children.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/13/followers-of-christ-idaho-religious-sect-child-mortality-refusing-medical-help)  There are people who believe seeking any kind of medical attention from doctors is "playing God".  Yet, we would not exist as a healthy society today were it not for scientific advancement.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Considering cloning as immoral, while not considering other types of intervening in natural processes as immoral \(such as manipulating electricity\) is hypocritical.
1.2.3.2. Con: There is no empirical evidence available to substantiate God creating animals.
1.2.3.3. Con: "If God created animals then cloning is intervening" claim is invalid because cohabitance inevitably brings mutual intervention with individual animals \(e.g. killing and eating them\), groups of animals \(side-effects of changing ecosystems\) and species \(encouraging evolutionary changes by changing environment\)
1.2.3.4. Con: If this argument is meant to be taken literally, claiming that humans are "playing God" pre-supposes that such an entity exists, which we do not know.
1.2.3.5. Pro: Cloning animals functions by working outside of these balanced processes, potentially throwing it off balance.
1.2.4. Con: We are constantly doing so.
1.2.4.1. Pro: We are erasing huge areas of forests for more crops or animal farms.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Greenhouses are one huge example of changing natural processes.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Human intervenes with the natural process since agriculture was invented.
1.2.5. Con: The fact that a process is natural doesn't mean we shouldn't intervene.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Cancer and malaria are a natural processes that kill hundreds of thousands of people every year.
1.2.5.2. Pro: In fact, before we intervened using vaccines and antibiotics, a simple bacterium could kill the vast majority of the population.
For example, back death or polio

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine)
1.2.6. Pro: Cloning animals reduces life's value only to functioning, while most of us humans seek something greater in life than just performing our function, so we shouldn't enforce it on other living creatures as well.
1.2.6.1. Con: Cloned animals have value beyond simply functioning or otherwise we wouldn't clone them.
1.2.6.2. Con: We actively seek out reason beyond function, if animals do not then presumably they don't feel the need for it.
1.3. Pro: Animal cloning could repair the large amount of damage humans have done on this planet.
1.3.1. Pro: Species in danger of extinction could be saved by cloning.
1.3.1.1. Con: If the species is so close to extinction then the size of the gene pool would be too limited. Therefore existing and future genetic defects would be perpetuated by cloning. This would ultimately lead to the extinction of the species anyway.
1.3.2. Pro: Species that are already extinct could be revived.
1.3.2.1. Con: Cloning does not increase the genepool, to get a species back to a point where it's population can sustain itself again a lot of different individuals need to be cloned and transported to a living place with genetically different populations.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Especially for larger animals this could become a time consuming and expensive project requiring a lot of people to work together.
1.3.3. Con: Cloning to date has been small scale.
1.4. Pro: Controlled animal cloning will noticeably reduce the global hunger issue which we will soon encounter.
1.4.1. Pro: If we insist on eating meat, and as our population grows, then animal cloning is the best way to ensure sufficient supply within the next few decades.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Cloning allows us to engineer meat in a way that is most suitable for human consumption and demand.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Scientists can [genetically modify cloned animals](https://www.kialo.com/an-alternative-to-veganism-is-genetically-modifying-animals-so-that-they-dont-feel-pain-5435/5435.0=5435.1/=5435.1) not to feel pain, thus reducing their suffering. This is may be an alternative to veganism for those concerned about the suffering of these animals.
1.4.1.2. Con: Bringing sentient beings to life only to kill them afterwards for food consumption is not ethical, nor a sustainable way of supplying food.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: Raising animals for food consumption was a sustainable way of supplying food to humans for thousands of years before the industrial revolution.
1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: The sustainability argument doesn’t necessarily handle the active/natural distinction. If animals are actively brought to life just to be killed, that is different from using already existing animals for food. One is intended death from the outset while the other is intended death after the fact.
1.4.1.3. Con: It currently costs more money and resources to create a clone than to raise food animals traditionally.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: [It cost $15,000 to clone a cow in 2009.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-food-cloning/welcome-to-the-clone-farm-idUSTRE5AC07V20091113)[A cow cost no more than $3,000 in Ohio in 2017.](http://homesteadersofamerica.com/family-milk-cow-101/)
1.4.2. Pro: It could be ethical if the goal is for example to clone parts of that animal for food, without that animal-part ever having had a conscious mind, thus never having to suffer.
1.5. Pro: Cloning animals can provide a way for beloved family pets to live on.
1.5.1. Con: As memories \(along with other defining post-birth events\) are not carried over to the clone, the clone has not experienced the love from the family and does not even know them.
1.5.2. Con: This would be deliberately misleading people, possibly children, about the natural order of life just to prevent the heartache of a lost pet.
1.5.3. Con: While the cloned animal will resemble a beloved pet, it may not have the same character, making it hard to believe it is the same animal.
1.5.4. Pro: Domesticated pets have a shorter life span than humans. Cloning them would provide a way for them to live longer lives with the humans that love them.
1.5.4.1. Con: Clones generally have shortened lifespans since cloned DNA is a replica of the animal in its current condition. For example Dolly the sheep was cloned from a six year old sheep and as a result lived to only 6 years of age which is much lower then the average lifespan of a sheep.
1.5.5. Con: The idea that one can bring an animal back to life through cloning interrupts the grief process and is unhealthy and therefore unethical.
1.6. Con: Reliance on technology to produce animals will reduce government funding of livestock farmers.
1.6.1. Con: How one uses technology is not an argument against that technology, but against how it is being used.
1.6.2. Pro: Which is good, because government shouldn't intervene in free market.
1.7. Pro: Cloning is pragmatically indistinguishable from natural asexual reproduction.
1.8. Pro: The scientific act of cloning an animal is void of moral interpretation. The intended use of the cloned animal is subject to moral judgement.
1.9. Con: Cloning animals leads to weakening the natural gene pool.
1.9.1. Pro: Cloned animals, such as the [cloned monkeys](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/cloned-monkeys-china-zhong-zhong-hua-hua-cruelty-dolly-sheep-a8177966.html) in China, have weaker immune systems.
1.9.2. Con: Selective breeding already is weakening the natural gene pool of animals.
1.9.3. Con: The quantitative effect of cloning on the gene pool would be negligent, far smaller than the effect of current practices such as breeding.
1.9.4. Pro: Cloning genes appear to deny individuality that's through reproduction.
1.9.4.1. Con: Twins are not denied individuality.
1.9.5. Pro: Cloned animals could be used for selective breeding in order to decrease the effects of issues caused naturally or by humans. Reinforcing the species when faced with devastation.
1.9.5.1. Pro: There are already problems in agriculture due to genetic homogeneity. With animals, these problems would be even worse as animals are more difficult and expensive to replace by a new type.
1.9.6. Con: Cloning the healthiest of the herd will allow for the strongest genetics to be expressed, thus improving the health of the herd over time.
1.9.6.1. Con: Cloning decreases genetic variation of a population.
1.9.6.2. Con: "Strength" of genetics is [contextual](http://theconversation.com/natural-selection-in-black-and-white-how-industrial-pollution-changed-moths-43061) and [subjective](http://www.dummies.com/home-garden/hobby-farming/raising-chickens/health-problems-unique-to-chickens-raised-for-meat/).
1.9.6.2.1. Pro: Cloning good or perfect genes is not knowing how genes are good or perfect. It is better to promote the health of genes; to understand what causes the degeneracy of genes, than to copy good genes, which may also degenerate by toxins, poor diet, etc.
1.9.6.2.2. Pro: Broiler chickens bred to grow more meat and more quickly have health and mobility problems and shorter lifespans, which is a problem for both chickens and egg farmers.
1.10. Con: Cloning can create suffering for animals.
1.10.1. Con: The knowledge gained from cloning may save many other animals from suffering in the long run.
1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.1.
1.10.3. Pro: Cloning animal is a way for laboratories to get a lot of new subjects to experiment upon. This makes these animals´lives just useful to scientists, not to the owners of those lives: criatures are only born to be  tortured until its death. It is just not acceptable.
1.10.3.1. Con: This is an argument against using animals in laboratory testing, not cloning in general.
1.10.4. Pro: Creating life just to live in a lab and be studied is wrong. This is not a life worth living even for animals.
1.10.4.1. Con: Laboratories already use naturally born animals for experimentation, arguably cloning would require less animals to be exploited because you wouldn't need to keep breading stock.
1.10.5. Con: Cloning an animal does not require harming an animal.
1.10.6. Pro: Cloning may result in animals with[severe abnormalities.](http://news.mit.edu/2002/cloning-0911)
1.10.6.1. Con: Science can improve methods.
1.10.6.1.1. Pro: Like now with [developments](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5732344/) of gene editing, cloning may result without severe abnormalities that lead to animal suffering.
1.10.6.1.2. Pro: Dolly was cloned over 20 years ago. Improvements in technology and cloning capabilities have happened since then.
1.10.6.1.2.1. Pro: Although Dolly's plight is well publicized most don't know that she had 4 sisters all who developed normally and lived a normal sheep life span without major complications.  So while it took 273 tries to get it right, once they got it right, they got it right 5 times and 4 of those times had no issues. [livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/55551-cloned-sheep-dolly-aging-health.html)
1.10.6.1.3. Con: The act of improving methods means experimenting on more animals to perfect results, adding to suffering.
1.10.6.2. Con: Conventionally breeding animals may also result in animals with severe abnormalities.
1.10.7. Pro: [Dolly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_\(sheep\)) the sheep, the first animal clone was fraught with debilitating health issues, resulting in her death prematurely.
1.10.7.1. Con: -> See 1.10.6.1.2.
1.10.8. Con: In the future, after more scientific study, it is possible that cloning could lessen the suffering of both animals and humans.
1.10.8.1. Con: This is hypothetical and should not be used for the basis of what is currently wrong with cloning animals now, which is more suffering.
1.10.8.1.1. Con: Unfortunately, the current state of science can cause harm, still progress on this field, as in any other, requires experiments. With enough caution we can reduce suffering until we eliminate all of it.
1.10.9. Con: An existence with some suffering may be preferable to never having existed.
1.10.9.1. Pro: Humans who [live with disabilities](http://old.post-gazette.com/lifestyle/20020609herman0609fnp3.asp) after an accident often say they are happy to be alive rather than wishing they were dead.
1.11. Pro: The possible scientific advancements outweigh the ethical issues.
1.11.1. Con: All scientific endeavors have the potential to advance their respective fields of study. If the possibility for scientific advancement were sufficient to supersede ethical considerations, then no scientific endeavor could be regarded as unethical.
1.11.2. Pro: Cloning animals can aid in stem cell research to improve the health of humans.
1.11.3. Pro: Cloning would allow the preservation of species and biodiversity for ecosystems.
1.11.3.1. Pro: Cloning would allow scientists to save endangered species as a faster rate.
1.11.3.1.1. Pro: Cloning may be the only option in some cases to save a species.
1.11.3.2. Pro: Cloning might provide a way to bring a species back from extinction.
1.11.3.2.1. Con: Bringing species back from extinction may not be ethical.
1.11.3.2.1.1. Pro: The money used for conservation of resurrected species would be more [efficiently](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/bringing-extinct-species-back-dead-could-hurt-not-help-conservation-efforts) spent preventing existing species from going extinct in the first place.
1.11.3.2.1.2. Pro: Bringing back a species would mean bringing them into a world where their [environment](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/10055242/People-need-to-think-about-ethics-of-bringing-back-Ice-Age-animals.html) or ecological niche no longer exists. This would bring them to: die all over again; live only in zoos; or survive in the wild by becoming an invasive species \(possibly wiping out other species\).
1.11.3.2.1.2.1. Con: These animals become extinct again because most of the time their extinction is due to human actions, rather than environment or genetic problems
1.11.4. Pro: Cloning animals advances science in that scientists learn better about what cloning effects there are.
1.11.4.1. Pro: Better understanding of cloning could yield future benefits for humans.
1.11.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.11.5. Con: Private patenting and control over genetic improvement could cause inequality, as only some would be able to access or afford it.
1.11.6. Con: We may need to outweigh the ethics for some science developments, but with the actual technology we also may find ways to do this without using animals as our laboratory guinea pig.
1.11.6.1. Pro: There has to be a deeper understanding of what impact we will face when cloning animals and humans become normal.
1.12. Con: Animals can't consent to being cloned.
1.12.1. Con: But animals can't consent to being born either.
1.12.2. Con: Animals lack the ability to dissent or consent to anything. Pets can't consent to being healed, but we don't consider it unethical for this reason.
1.13. Pro: Cloning of animals can improve the health quality of the herd.
1.13.1. Con: Cloning is not a deterministic process since it does not have a 100% probable output.
1.13.1.1. Con: It is incredibly difficult for any scientific process to have a 0% fail rate. Even raising animals in a completely natural environment isn't a 100% guarantee that they will be healthy.
1.13.1.2. Con: No scientific process has a 100 percent success rate. IVF babies, GMO plants and fertilisers are beneficial scientific processes. They dont have 100 percent success rates either.
1.13.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.6.
1.13.3. Con: Clones often have more fragile health than the parent and require much more attention to survive.
1.13.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.1.
