Discussion Title: Is Porn Beneficial?

1. Porn is Beneficial
1.1. Con: Porn ruins relationships.
1.1.1. Con: In a [study](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/attraction-evolved/201610/how-pornography-really-affects-relationships), the majority of participating couples self-reported that porn had no negative affect on their relationship.
1.1.2. Pro: [Studies](https://fightthenewdrug.org/how-consuming-porn-can-lead-to-violence/) have shown that consumers of porn are more likely to use verbal coercion, drugs, and alcohol to coerce individuals into sex.
1.1.3. Con: Porn itself does not ruin relationships, rather the choices one makes in relation to watching porn.
1.1.4. Con: Porn can help to spice up a relationship.
1.1.4.1. Pro: [Seventy-two percent](https://meetville.com/blog/72-of-americans-watch-porn-with-their-partner-to-improve-sex-life/) of Americans watch porn with their partners to improve their sex life.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Watching porn can offer new ideas and things to try in the bedroom.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Porn can provide a couple with creative things to try with and on each other that they may not have thought about otherwise.
1.1.5. Pro: Attention is taken away from one's partner to focus on viewing others being pleasured.
1.1.6. Pro: Porn kills [love](https://fightthenewdrug.org/how-porn-kills-love/). Therefore, it cannot be a benefit to a relationship.
1.1.6.1. Con: That depends entirely on the preconceptions that a couple brings into a relationship, and is not inherently true.
1.1.7. Pro: Watching porn creates unrealistic sexual expectations.
1.1.7.1. Con: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22449010) showed the female pornography was associated with better sexual quality and satisfaction within a relationship.
1.1.7.2. Pro: The majority of porn gives a distorted view of what actually happens during sex, and only capitalizes on factors which turn on the viewers. Imagine a kid's only interaction with sex is through mainstream porn - he will think that intimacy isn't something done during sex.
1.1.7.3. Pro: Porn makes the viewer more targeted torwards visual aspect sex and less in touch with the other senses of lovemaking.
1.1.7.4. Pro: Porn creates an image that women are always ready and willing for sex.
1.1.7.4.1. Pro: Women usually take a longer time before arousal than men. Porn creates a belief that the arousal should happen instantly.
1.2. Pro: Porn allows for the creation of a legal job market for sex workers.
1.2.1. Con: Jobs in porn industry are low paid, mentally and physically damaging.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Several female [porn stars](https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-are-so-many-female-porn-stars-turning-up-dead) have reported committed suicide due to the bullying and rejection associated with their field.
1.2.2. Con: Porn also creates a platform for illegal porn and exploitation of minors.
1.2.3. Pro: Women and men are able to make a living providing sexual entertainment for others.

1.4. Con: The porn industry is not well regulated.
1.4.1. Pro: [Child pornography](http://enough.org/stats_exploitation) offenses have increased over 200% in the last decade despite being illegal.
1.4.2. Pro: Sexual abuse is rampant in the porn industry.[vt.co](http://vt.co/entertainment/sexual-abuse-porn-industry-rife-no-one-wants-talk/)
1.4.2.1. Con: Better security for participants can be incited.
1.4.3. Pro: Some porn is created via [human trafficking](https://fightthenewdrug.org/the-internet-can-be-a-very-unsexy-place-we/).
1.4.3.1. Con: Human trafficking is not specific to pornography. Human trafficking is essentially slavery, which is used throughout the world to manufacture and sell products of all kinds.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: The [sex trafficking](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/08/porn-human-trafficking-reinforce-each-other/) industry, which makes up 79% of human trafficking, is fueled by the porn industry.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: Sexual exploitation is a vast category, of which pornography is a fraction.
1.4.4. Pro: In many places there are insufficient safety regulations, this has resulted in [STD outbreaks](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/02/stds-porn-industry_n_2064639.html) in the porn community.
1.4.5. Con: There are things we can do to better regulate porn.
1.4.5.1. Pro: The movie industry uses a rating system, and has regulation around safety of actors in a film. An ethics rating system could be used on porn that takes the safety of the actors into account.
1.5. Con: Porn is degrading.
1.5.1. Con: As some of it is meant to be - as long as it is made within legal bounds and as long as the participants consent to everything willingly \(as opposed to being forced into it\), porn being degrading is, in itself, not a negative thing.
1.5.1.1. Con: Appealing to legal systems doesn't provide any tangible sort of evaluation of the benefits of a thing. Legal systems are demonstrably unconcerned with general human welfare.
1.5.2. Pro: Porn can be exploitative.
1.5.2.1. Pro: In some porn BDSM is irresponsibly represented, and shows women being abused rather than participating in consensual play.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: One study found that [88%](https://fightthenewdrug.org/how-consuming-porn-can-lead-to-violence/) of porn scenes contained physical violence.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: This statistic does not appear to consider areas of pornography where violence is desired; for example, BDSM pornography. As such, this statistic appears more sensationalist than strictly accurate.
1.5.2.1.1.2. Con: There are an extensive [number of studies](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201606/how-much-porn-depicts-violence-against-women) that contradict this. Five other peer-reviewed studies found no higher than 36% of porn scenes contained violence. Indeed, one of the most recent studies indicated only 2% of scenes involved physical violence.
1.5.2.2. Con: Porn can be exploitative of men also.
1.5.3. Pro: Pornography objectifies and dehumanizes the actors, breaking them down into sexual objects.
1.5.3.1. Con: If a woman, knowingly and willingly, wishes to manifest herself in an adult movie as a sexual object, then it is her free choice. If a man decides to watch that movie and use her as a sexual stimuli, then both achieve their goals - hence porn, in this specific example, is mutually beneficial and objectification and dehumanization is not a harmful byproduct, but a purposeful goal of making and consuming the movie.
1.5.4. Con: Some [suggest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85Ly9w3XsTo) there can be a form of [ethical pornography](http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-21/ethical-porn-does-it-exist-and-where-do-you-find-it/8091266), and a [partnership for it](http://ethicalporn.org/about/) has been formed within the industry.
1.5.5. Con: Many things that are permissible and beneficial can have negative affects, like cars.
1.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.6. Con: Some religions consider pornography to be immoral.
1.6.1. Con: Something can be considered beneficial, yet immoral to some.
1.6.2. Pro: The [United Methodist Church](http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/pornography-and-sexual-violence), the third largest Christian denomination in the US believes pornography is about violence, degradation, exploitation and coercion.
1.6.3. Pro: In [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_on_pornography#Islam), modesty and privacy are basic principles to live by. Pornography is considered to be in opposition to the word of Allah \(God\).
1.6.4. Con: Pointing to religious doctrine is an argument from authority and should not be the basis for preventing something that may otherwise be beneficial.
1.7. Pro: There are relationship benefits from porn use.
1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.7.3. Con: Porn causes beliefs about sex that are not realistic, but cinematic, towards how it should look instead of how it feels.
1.7.4. Pro: If one member has a higher sex drive, allowing that person to masturbate to porn can alleviate difficulties that this discrepancy might otherwise cause to a marriage.
1.7.4.1. Con: That partner can masterbate without watching porn.
1.7.5. Pro: For some, watching porn while having sex is arousing. This helps the sex experience of both.
1.7.5.1. Con: This will cause the viewer to be aroused to visual sense of sex instead of all senses.
1.7.6. Con: Porn makes one partner satisfied only.
1.7.6.1. Con: Porn satisfies both partners' needs when only one partner wants sex.
1.7.6.1.1. Pro: The partner not wanting sex will not feel pressured to have it while the one who does can experience a release of sexual and emotional tension. Though it may not be the ultimate satisfaction, it is satisfaction for both nonetheless.
1.7.6.2. Con: One's sexual partner is not always available, thus watching porn helps some people answer their needs by themselves.
1.7.7. Pro: Men benefit [psychologically](https://blogs.psychcentral.com/sex-addiction/2013/02/porn-as-good-therapy/) from porn.
1.7.7.1. Pro: Suppressing the innate sex drive of humans can lead to negative mental health outcomes.
1.7.7.1.1. Con: Not watching porn does not suppress one's sex drive. Not having sex does.
1.8. Con: Porn is addictive.
1.8.1. Con: The inherent addictiveness to porn is on par with video games. Few people get as upset about video game addiction which suggests that this argument is at least somewhat disingenuous.
1.8.1.1. Con: Video game addiction will be classified as an official mental health condition next year by the World Health Organization \(WHO\).[mashable.com](http://mashable.com/2017/12/28/gaming-disorder/#OQ8_UuZ0ZaqK)
1.8.2. Pro: Porn can be overstimulating and things that overstimulate receptors in the brain produce an effect that many find addictive.
1.8.2.1. Con: Not all porn is overstimulating. For example, a lot of porn is written, meaning that the imagery is all in someones head.
1.8.3. Con: Anything can become addictive \(e.g. food, medication, television, etc\), yet they can still be beneficial.
1.8.4. Con: There are many things that can become addicting but is not inherently bad, such as food, gaming, and sex. Thus, the real issue is what is causing the addiction, not the focus of the addiction.
1.8.5. Pro: Fifty percent of men and 20% of women of religious faith admitted to being [addicted](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/elwood-d-watson/pornography-addiction-amo_b_5963460.html) to pornography.
1.9. Pro: Porn [made possible](http://www.enterprisefeatures.com/ten-indispensable-technologies-built-by-the-pornography-industry/) many essential technologies that built the modern world, including the internet and antipiracy methods.
1.9.1. Pro: Through pin-up star Danni Ashe's successful soft-porn site, she and her team helped pioneer the use of e-commerce sites such as Paypal, Ebay, and Amazon.
1.10. Pro: Porn promotes diversity by acknowledging different tastes and sexual quirks.
1.10.1. Pro: Studies show so-called fetishes are common. Porn allows individuals to explore those thoughts in a safe, private way.[Study shows fetishes are extremely common...](https://www.maxim.com/maxim-man/most-common-unusual-fetishes-2016-04)
1.10.2. Pro: For example, the [Porn Film Festival Berlin](http://pornfilmfestivalberlin.de/en/about-the-festival/) screens around 100 films each year, focusing on feminist and queer productions.
1.11. Pro: Porn can reduce the value and importance we give to exterior beauty and sex appeal in society and marriage.

1.12.2. Pro: Porn can help provide a safe release of emotional and sexual tension.
1.12.2.1. Pro: There are some health benefits from solo play.

1.12.2.2.2. Pro: Masturbating has essentially zero risk of pregnancy.
1.12.2.2.2.1. Pro: It would be incredibly difficult to accidentally impregnate oneself during typical solitary masturbation.
1.12.2.3. Con: Although it is an outlet for desires that are not met or a releasing of inner repression, porn is not the best way to address these challenges.
1.12.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.
1.12.4. Pro: Masturbating has a near zero risk of sexually transmitted infections \(STIs\).
1.12.4.1. Pro: The risk is not quite zero, as it can depend on the cleanliness of objects used in the act.
1.13. Con: -> See 1.1.7.
