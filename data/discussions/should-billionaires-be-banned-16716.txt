Discussion Title: Should billionaires be banned?

1. Billionaires should be taxed at 100% on all wealth over $999,999,999
1.1. Con: Giving away the majority of your wealth should be voluntary, not enforced.
1.1.1. Pro: Billionaires could give 100% of their earnings above $999,999,999 to charities/non-profits rather than in taxation.
1.1.2. Con: Anyone who owns more than a billion dollars is too rich. That degree of concentration of wealth is unhealthy and unethical. If they don't want to give their money away, we can ignore that, since they have a moral duty, which is just as good as actual consent in this case.
1.1.3. Con: Unfortunately, people can be selfish and sometimes it is necessary to act in the interests of all, rather than one.
1.2. Con: If billionaires were taxed at 100%, they would no longer have interest in investing on their businesses. If their businesses fail, the global economy might crumble.
1.2.1. Con: It is dangerous and irresponsible for the global economy to rely on a handful of giant "Too Big To Fail" businesses anyway. An example would be how Lehman Brothers collapse triggered the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
1.2.2. Con: [Peak happiness has been proven by wealth experts to be achieved when somebody is earning $75,000 per annum, but a fulfilling, having-it-all lifestyle cost is around $100 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/20/how-much-money-you-need-to-be-happy-according-to-wealth-experts.html).
1.3. Con: It would be difficult to implement
1.3.1. Pro: [A tenth of the world’s wealth is held in tax havens](https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/paradise-papers) which shows that billionaires have clever tactics to avoid paying their fair share of tax.
1.3.2. Pro: Distributing earnings on different \(legal\) persons will reduce the amount to be taxed significantly.
1.3.3. Con: That it would be hard does not mean it shouldn't be done.
1.3.3.1. Con: But also doesnt mean that it should be done
1.4. Con: It is not the job of the government to make things fair. It is it's job to defend us against foreign and domestic threats.
1.4.1. Con: [The first sentence of the US Constitution](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-constitution/) says that the constitution is "in order to form a more perfect union"... and "promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity". The government's job is much more than defence; it is also about promoting and securing welfare and blessings for all citizens.
1.5. Pro: No individual needs to own more than $999,999,999 in personal wealth.
1.5.1. Pro: Most conceivable luxuries on this earth can be purchased for less than $999,999,999
1.6. Con: A 100% tax on anything is harmful for tax revenues.
1.6.1. Pro: The [laffer curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve) ought to be mentioned here, which measures the relation between the tax rate and the tax revenue. 0% tax rate means 0% tax revenue, and the tax revenue would from there go up in correlation with the tax rate. However, this cannot go on forever, because nobody would operate in a given tax domain if all their money would be taken, i.e. nobody would work if their income tax were such. If the purpose is revenue, 100% tax is self-destructive. It should be placed somewhere inbetween.
1.7. Con: It is unfair to tax anybody at 100%, however wealthy they are.
1.7.1. Con: They would still have $999,999,999 of wealth which is more than adequate for any individual to live a "billionaire lifestyle".
1.7.2. Con: Taxing someone at that rate would be unfair if they made their money fair and square. But billionaires simply don't do that. They benefit from a rigged system, namely capitalism.
1.7.3. Con: Perhaps it is more unfair for someone to possess that kind of wealth while others starve.
1.8. Pro: [The 8 richest men on earth own the same wealth as the poorest 3.6 billion people](https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2017-01-16/just-8-men-own-same-wealth-half-world) which is unethical. Billions of the world's poorest people are starving or financially struggling. Some of that wealth should be redistributed from the top to the bottom.
1.8.1. Con: If one believes in capitalism, which includes the super rich but also the middle class as well, it is not unfair or unethical that people accumulate wealth depending on their capacities and conditions.
1.8.2. Pro: These numbers are actually outdated. It's less than 9 people now. [www.oxfam.org](https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2017-01-16/just-8-men-own-same-wealth-half-world)
1.8.3. Con: By throwing money on the "problem" \(the poor\), root problems like overpopulation and a lack of eduction will not be solved.
1.8.3.1. Pro: The "solution" is only a temporary one. It creates a dependency on funding to serve their basic needs which always needs to be refueled, and doesn't help them gaining a steady source of income by themselves through a job. The money should come from volunteering donors and charities investing in companies and organizations offering those opportunities \(education and work\) for them, rather than the state forcing everyone to bail them out repeatedly.
1.8.3.2. Con: -> See discussion #9226: Global overpopulation is a myth.
1.9. Pro: The ultra-rich have too much influence over elections, public policy, and governance.
1.9.1. Con: Individuals can still have large amounts of financial power without having their wealth be personal. Billionaires like [George Soros](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-17/george-soros-pours-billions-into-charity-as-tax-deadline-looms) and [Bill Gates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2017/08/13/the-biggest-and-best-tax-break-of-all-time/#61f13a7f2b23) are able to deduct charitable donations to their own foundations from their taxes while still maintaining global influence through said foundations.
1.9.1.1. Con: Monetary contributions to ineffective or outright nefarious organizations count as "charitable donations". Laws that determine what constitutes charity in many countries is too broad.
1.9.2. Con: It may also be dangerous to control that power with almost punitive measures.
1.10. Con: Billionaires are able to fund non-profits and be powerful philanthropists, [achieving things that other organisations are not able to do.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation)
1.10.1. Pro: In the past, entrepeneurs have been crucial to establish new forms of support for the poor.
1.10.1.1. Pro: [Jakob Fugger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugger#Jakob_Fugger_%22the_Rich%22), who was probably the richest person ever alive, created the [Fuggerei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuggerei) which is still used today for social disadvantage housing.
1.10.2. Con: Global living standards improve. This reduces the need for philantropists and non-profits.
1.10.2.1. Con: Global living standards \(or projected global living standards\) are falling for many people. [Many millennials have had a significant fall in living standards than their parents.](https://www.ft.com/content/363af3be-1236-11e8-940e-08320fc2a277)
1.10.3. Con: Governments can take over spending after they tax billionaires.
1.10.4. Con: Billionaires are the ones who fund some of those projects because they are the people who have the money. If someone else had that money, they could do the same thing.
1.10.5. Con: It is not the case that Bill Gates \(Gates Foundation\) and others like him are the only ones dedicated to philanthropy. There are other organisations such as Care, Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders.
1.10.6. Con: Wealth inequality is actually one of the factors that produce much of the suffering these philanthropists are attempting to solve.
1.10.7. Con: For every Bill Gates, there are two Jeff Bezos who are working in the opposite direction: lower taxes for the rich and less public spending.
1.10.8. Con: Charity only perpetuates societal inequality. Ultimately, it is the structures that need to change and it is only governments that can deliver large structural changes.
1.11. Pro: Society relies on income from taxes for education, healthcare and more, but too much global wealth is being hoarded by just a handful of individuals.
1.12. Pro: The wealth gap will continue to grow and the only way to tackle it is drastic globally coordinated political action.
1.12.1. Con: A growing wealth gap is no problem in itself as long as the poor improve as well.
1.12.2. Con: If nations under a union like the EU are not even able to harmonize taxes, it is very unlikely that all nations agree on having the same tax for the super rich.
1.12.2.1. Con: Global consensus is not expected to occur immediately. Legislation often occurs as a progressive "domino effect" in nations with similar economic systems and core values.
