Discussion Title: Should You Get A Pet?

1. Pet keeping is morally justified.
1.1. Pro: Pets cause mental, emotional, and physical [health benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet?oldformat=true#Effects_of_pets_on_their_caregiver's_health) for their owners.
1.1.1. Pro: Pets help reduce stress for their owners.
1.1.1.1. Con: [Pets that are ill create stress for their owners](http://time.com/4946189/sick-pets-caregiver-burden-stress/).
1.1.1.2. Con: [Pet loss could trigger PTSD](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/tc/grief-and-ptsd-overview) in individuals. The PTSD could get triggered by seeing someone else's dog that looks similar to the one they lost.
1.1.1.3. Con: Pets limit the places people can go. Since pets cannot be taken everywhere, people get separated periodically from their pets. This can be emotionally distressing for an individual
1.1.2. Pro: Having certain pets encourage healthy habits, such as exercise.
1.1.3. Con: Just because something has a good effect, does not make it "right".
1.1.3.1. Pro: For example, one could argue that slavery could be good for the national economy, but it doesn't make slavery right in the sense of our moral ethics.
1.1.4. Pro: Pets offer company.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Humans have co-evolved with some pets, like dogs and cats, and this interdependence means that some humans need pets to feel good.
1.1.5. Con: Pets can also prove [dangerous](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/diseases-your-pet-can-give-you#1) for human health.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Cats, for example, infect many of their owners with toxiplasmosis, which has been linked to mental health issues such as schizophrenia \([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3035534)\) and aggressiveness \([telegraph.co.uk](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/30/owning-a-cat-can-lead-to-mental-health-problems-study-warns/)\)
1.1.6. Pro: Pets are capable of raising your happiness and decrease your depression.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Pets provide much needed [social support](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-social-self/201107/friends-benefits-pets-make-us-happier-healthier).
1.1.7. Con: Pets can get jealous of lovers and vice versa.
1.1.7.1. Con: Exhibiting jealousy is a normal emotion and can be remedied through behavioral conditioning.
1.1.7.2. Con: This depends on the sentience of a pet or species. A snake, for example isn't likely to display jealousy like a dog.
1.1.8. Pro: Pets help us to be more compassionate thus are helpful in the molding of ones character.
1.1.9. Con: Pets are just as mortal as you are. If becoming emotionally attached to a pet, its death can lead to emotional upset when it dies.
1.1.10. Con: The personal benefit of an action is not the only factor to consider in a moral choice.
1.1.11. Pro: Pets have certain purposes that could help individuals, such as elderly, those with mental conditions \(such as autism\), and the handicapped \(such as blind.\).
1.2. Con: Pets can put a financial strain on their owner.
1.2.1. Pro: There can be a lot of medical expenses, as well as food, shelter, etc. that add up to a lot of money.
1.2.1.1. Pro: First year [average total cost](https://www.aspca.org/sites/default/files/pet_care_costs.pdf) of keeping a dog is $1,471 and $1,174 for a cat.
1.2.2. Con: It is the responsibility of the owner to decide if the benefits of having a pet, outweigh the financial costs one may face.
1.2.3. Pro: When pets aren't used as a necessity, they can be a huge waste of time and [money](http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+2106&aid=1543).
1.2.3.1. Con: The companionship and happiness a pet provides its owner is worth every penny for some owners.
1.2.4. Con: This argument applies to children as well, yet we are not arguing if having children is moral or not.
1.2.5. Con: The morality of an issue can not be determined by its financial value.
1.3. Con: Keeping a pet places bias on protecting one species over another.
1.3.1. Pro: This undermines saving endangered species, as the money spent on a pet could be better spent on saving animals that truly need protection from extinction.
1.3.2. Con: People choose pets for companionship, not to ensure survival of a species.
1.3.3. Con: Humans protect animals of other species in different ways, such as conservation and sanctuaries.
1.3.4. Pro: Unless the pet is herbivore or [fed with vegan brands](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/may/24/vegetarianism-pets-national-vegetarian-week-cats-dogs), their food comes from the slaughter of other animals.
1.3.4.1. Pro: [Research found](http://www.vegepets.info/resources/Publications/By-products-Halpin-et-al-1999.pdf) that the typical level of meat by-products in cat foods is 35-50% compared to a range of 25-40% in dog foods.
1.4. Pro: Domesticated animals rely on humans' care to survive. We should provide such a care when possible.
1.4.1. Pro: It would be immoral not to care for living beings that rely on us for their comfort and survival.
1.4.1.1. Con: Animals rely on us only if bred as pets. If raised in the wild, they survive on their own quite successfully.
1.4.1.2. Con: It could also be immoral to capture an animal and deprive it of its freedom. Your statement is a matter of perspective, not [a moral fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_realism).
1.4.1.3. Con: Humans have too little understanding of other species' needs to provide them with a verifiably good life.
1.4.1.4. Con: Tapeworms rely on us for their comfort and survival. Ebola relies on us for its comfort and survival. Sewer rats rely on us for their comfort and survival. Thus, relying on us for comfort and survival as a sufficient criteria for the moral necessity of caring is limited by the willingness of people to care for tapeworms, and sewer rats, and ebola.
1.4.2. Con: These pets become dependent on the owners for their existence. This enables controlling tendencies in their caregivers.
1.4.3. Con: Domesticated animals only require that care because we have forced them into dependency on humans. Left to their own devices, they will often return to their natural survival instincts.
1.4.3.1. Con: Many domestic species cannot survive in the wild. They cannot [regain their survival instincts](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2008/01/predators-captivity-habitat-animals/) quickly enough, leading possibly to their extinction.
1.4.4. Con: Keeping a carnivorous pet contributes to the death of other animals, in order to feed them.
1.4.4.1. Con: Few pets are truly carnivorous, and their protein or other dietary needs can be met by alternative sources.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Whether it is right or not, it is quite common that carnivorous pets consume other kinds of food \(like lunch leftovers of whatever kind\). Their survivability is not affected \([examples](http://www.akc.org/content/health/articles/fruits-vegetables-dogs-can-and-cant-eat/)\).
1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: "As carnivores, they have no need for fruits and vegetables as part of their diet, but an occasional fruit or veggie as a treat is ok." it is beneficial but not a substitute for meat.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: Refusing to feed a minimum amount of meat protein to a naturaly carnivorous animal undermines it health, as plant protein lacks aminoacids for body protein use.
1.4.4.1.3. Con: Cats are a common pet and they are truly carnivorous.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Many dog and cat foods are made with processed parts of lamb, goats, horses, etc.
1.5. Pro: Non-human animals co-habituate with other non-animals for survival. Doing the same with a human is no different.
1.5.1. Pro: Some species of animals have evolved over thousands of years to coexist and cooperate with humans. This evolution cannot be reversed by making a decision about morality, thus it would make no sense to break this bond now.
1.5.2. Con: Animals may co-habituate as equals \(of their own choice\), but the human/pet relationship is \(by definition\) a dependent one. The animal relies on the human for all its needs, and if it attempts to leave or see to its own needs, it is usually punished or otherwise corrected.
1.5.2.1. Con: Although the current relationship is one sided, the relationship with dogs began as an interdependent one.  It has continued for thousands of years, and dogs seem genuinely happy to continue it.
1.5.3. Con: Humans lack the compassion or wisdom necessary to unselfishly care for an animal.
1.5.3.1. Con: [Village dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-ranging_dog#Village_dogs) have lived alongside humans for thousands of years, but are not entirely dependent on human care.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Pet keeping thus far has left the dog population inextricably dependent on people, with an overcrowded population that sees many of them killed in shellers, and rife with inbreeding and health problems.
1.5.3.3. Pro: Some people abuse their pets and laws are not always on the pets' side to help.
1.5.3.3.1. Con: Changing these laws is easier and more rational than banning having pets.
1.5.3.3.2. Con: If education and proof of ability to be a pet caretaker become a requirement prior to getting a pet, many people won't get a pet and a large portion of the collateral damages is cut out.
1.5.3.3.2.1. Con: Unfortunately, this may not come on time \(if ever\), which would cause needless suffering in the world.
1.5.3.4. Pro: People cannot take care of a pet if they cannot take care of themselves first \(such as not having enough money to eat\). This puts the pet \(and the pet owner\) into a neglectful situation.
1.5.3.5. Pro: Holding a creature against its will \(in a cage, an aquarium, inside the house\) is not morally right.
1.5.3.5.1. Con: There could be cases, where living under these conditions might be in the interest \("will"\) of an animal.
1.5.3.5.2. Con: The will of a creature cannot always be clearly determined.
1.5.3.5.2.1. Pro: Most animals lack the mental abilities to have something like free will.
1.5.3.6. Pro: People abandon their pets when they do not want them anymore.
1.5.3.6.1. Pro: Not only is this an issue but the abandonment causes problems when they become invasive species in nature \(such as the [lionfish](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lionfish.html) and [ferrets](http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/invasive-species/invasive-animals/invasive-mammals/ferrets)\).
1.5.3.7. Con: Plenty of people honestly love and care for their animals without selfish motives.
1.6. Con: The nuisance issue that pets cause \(such as strays\) burden governments with unnecessary costs.
1.6.1. Con: The health benefits that animals cause can potentially out-grow the costs by reduction in healthcare expenses.
1.6.2. Pro: Communities in the United States pay on average [$8 per capita](http://www.humanesociety.org/animal_community/resources/timelines/animal_sheltering_trends.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/) for animal shelters. With over [6.5 million pets](https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics) abandoned per year, this becomes a significant cost.
1.6.3. Pro: The breakdown of what the government pays for includes strays, spay/neuter, rehoming, etc.
1.6.4. Con: Ownerless cats and other animals that can find food in places where humans live will not go away when we stop having them as pets.
1.6.4.1. Pro: [Foxes](http://www.wildlifeinthecity.org/urban-wildlife/foxes/) were never domesticated on a large scale and can still be found in a lot of cities.
1.6.4.2. Con: Once an animal is domesticated \(including cared-for strays\), then it would find difficulties outside of human intervention.
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: Stray dogs and cats do not have the same instincts of survival as those who have never been domesticated. Without human intervention, it is possible they will not survive long in the wild.
1.6.5. Pro: Carnivorous pets such as dogs and cats can be a threat to biodiversity \(cats hunt small birds and mammals, dogs can disturb nesting birds or other species\).
1.6.5.1. Con: If we follow this reasoning, we should be concerned in exterminating all predators in nature. Lions are a danger to almost all other animals in African's savannah. Great white sharks are a danger to all life in the oceans. Exterminating them is not a concern. Exactly the opposite, in fact. Therefore, it is a contradiction to oppose pets.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: Predators tend to [increase and stabilize biodiversity](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/matt-skoglund/wolves-increase-biodiversity-and-greatly-benefit-ecosystems-they-inhabit).
1.6.6. Con: Some strays were never pets.
1.6.7. Pro: Pets often wreck havoc on native wildlife or establish feral populations as invasive species.
1.6.8. Pro: The costs to [set up shelters are in the millions and to maintain is over a half million dollars](http://journaltimes.com/news/local/animal-shelter-would-cost-million-to-get-running-k-annually/article_cf928334-944b-11e1-9d34-0019bb2963f4.html).
1.7. Pro: Pets are a sign of royalty, which shows a person's high morals \(due to their loyalty in preserving their social status, country's stature, and culture\).
1.7.1. Pro: Owning a pet can act as a modern day status symbol, depending on type of pet and breed.
1.7.1.1. Con: Pets are living beings that need care. They should not be kept or obtained for the purpose of status.
1.7.2. Con: Using another being to demonstrate high morals and royalty is fundamentally wrong.
1.7.3. Con: Royalty is not necessarily connected to high morals. Just like high social status is not synonymous with high morals.
1.7.4. Con: Owning a pet does not equal high morals. You can keep a pet and abuse it. The way you treat your animals is a determinant of your morals, not simply an act of owning them.
1.7.5. Pro: Pets like the [Pomeranian](https://pombeachpomeranians.weebly.com/the-pomeranians-royal-history.html) are bred by royalty and media portray the animals associated with the families they are bred by.
1.7.6. Con: Pets were treated as objects, as they were [gifts for royalty](https://www.pedigree.com/dog-care/dog-facts/dynasty-dogs-the-royal-history-of-the-shih-tzu).
1.7.7. Con: Pets were objectified in religious practices, such as the [Saluki in ancient Egypt](https://www.canidae.com/blog/2010/09/saluki-royal-dog-of-egypt/)
1.8. Con: Keeping pets forms a [mild system of inter-species oppression](https://medium.com/\@laila.kassam/animal-rights-social-justice-and-the-five-faces-of-oppression-part-2-961b0c0b6a4).
1.8.1. Pro: With so many ethical options \(such as digital aquariums instead of real ones\), there are no needs for pets.
1.8.1.1. Con: Solutions like digital aquariums are like digital fireplaces. Except from the visual effect, they hardly provide anything else.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: However, aquariums generally do not provide anything else, except for visual effect. Since digital aquariums provide that, nothing is amiss.
1.8.1.1.2. Pro: That is beneficial, because the alternative of a true pet could cause deleterious side effects \(such as [lionfish becoming an invasive species](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/stories/lionfish/welcome.html)\) that outweigh any advantages of having them as a digital display.
1.8.1.2. Con: Even the alternative of a digital aquarium is not truly ethical as it still uses resources to have one \(such as electronics and electricity\). Most ethical is no pet or alternative.
1.8.1.3. Con: This does not provide a solution for any animal that doesn't live in an aquarium.
1.8.1.3.1. Con: Inanimate objects \(such as [pet rocks](http://www.petrock.com/)\), [digital pets](http://www.neopets.com/), or taking care of wildlife \(such as through cleanups and establishing preserves\) are ethical alternatives to non-aquatic house pets
1.8.1.3.1.1. Con: Taking inanimate objects out of the wild might not be ethical as it can impact wildlife \(a rock might be an animal's home\)
1.8.2. Pro: Anthropomorphization of pets is far too common and hazardous, as the lack of understanding of what their real needs are and of their way to communicate often lead to mishandling, resulting in problematic or aggressive behaviour and abandonment. This is an unnecessary stress factor both for people and the pets they keep.
1.8.3. Con: Pets benefit from being in human care, which does not exist in an oppressive relationship.
1.8.3.1. Con: Care is one of the benefits in oppressive relationships, as oppressed can get care, but can be oppressed while getting care. One example is when companies still pay people while preventing them from forming unions \(especially before union laws\).
1.8.4. Pro: Pets are [subjugated](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/subjugation) by the whim of humans.
1.8.4.1. Pro: Humans should not be in control of another species' genes. Through artificial breeding we are creating animals that should not naturally exist.
1.8.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.
1.8.4.3. Pro: Some pets are bred for fighting. We should not continue this cruel activity.
1.8.4.4. Pro: Some pet owners raise their pets for meat \(such as [dogs in China](https://books.google.com/books?id=F6UxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA120&lpg=PA120&dq=pets+oppression&source=bl&ots=h1dhwN_S37&sig=-w8ev4ziTec9jboqtvFDcV0H0co&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj1-uSAm5nZAhXL61MKHR4wBnAQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&q=pets%20oppression&f=false)\), which create even more immoralities.
1.8.4.4.1. Con: Eating meat is not inherently immoral.  All animals feed on other life forms, many of them on other animals, and humans have evolved to eat both meat and plants.  There is nothing wrong with any of this.
1.8.4.4.2. Con: Animals raised to be eaten are livestock rather than pets.  Raising livestock is no more immoral than keeping pets unless the animals are treated with unnecessary cruelty.
1.8.5. Pro: Keeping pets continues [speciesism](https://contexts.org/articles/speciesism/).
1.9. Con: Keeping pets is hazardous/offensive to other people.
1.9.1. Con: People should not have the right to decide what other people do in their own households.
1.9.2. Pro: Examples are those with allergies, are traumatized by, or do not have pets.
1.9.2.1. Pro: [If pets bite people, the person develops PTSD](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1224760)
1.9.2.1.1. Con: Symptoms of PTSD can be managed through therapies such as [systematic desensitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_desensitization).
1.9.2.1.1.1. Con: Treatment is not available to everyone, especially those who cannot afford it.
1.9.2.2. Pro: Pets bred for criminal activities, such as [dog fighting](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/dog-fighting/closer-look-dog-fighting), is offensive to law enforcement and citizens who are taxed more to pay for it.
1.9.2.2.1. Con: This is a case for better enforcement of dog fighting laws, as only those individuals who breed for this activity should not  get a pet, not the majority.
1.9.2.3. Con: Those that do not have a pet, do not have to get one if it offends them.
1.9.3. Con: Many things are hazardous/offensive to others, like nuts and religion. However, people accept and allow them because they provide benefits that people approve of and are only morally wrong in certain circumstances that can be controlled \(through marginalization or other methodologies\).
1.9.3.1. Con: Sometimes these are offensive/hazardous to the point they are banned. An example is how allergen [peanuts get banned at schools due to its immorality \(according to some\)](https://snacksafely.com/2011/11/why-your-child-cant-bring-peanut-butter-to-school/) \([map](https://snacksafely.com/put-your-school-on-the-map/)\).
1.9.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.10. Pro: Pets can play an important role in advancing society as a whole.
1.10.1. Pro: Dogs play an increasingly important role in early [detection](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/dogs-sniffing-out-health-problems/) of seizures, cancer, and other ailments that modern technology is unable to do. This is an advancement in modern medicine.
1.10.2. Con: Pets are not needed as much as they did to advance society. They are just tools that could be replaced by technology for that purpose.
1.10.2.1. Con: Many humans can be replaced as well. Replace-ability does not mean pets have no other value.
1.10.2.2. Con: Pets are like family members for those who take care of them, so can somehow replace human family members, aiding to solve the so-called overpopulation problem.
1.10.3. Pro: Caring for another spiecies can allows us to practice and develop empathy for animals other than humans.
1.10.4. Pro: Some pets help with work \(such as a herding dog on a farm\).
1.10.4.1. Con: While some pets may have use in our society, this does not mean useless ones have. Without clearly defined use, animals are most likely toys.
1.10.5. Con: To use another being to perpetuate and maintain human existence is not right.
1.10.5.1. Con: Every being, throughout the whole history of evolution, always uses other beings  to perpetuate and maintain its existence.
1.10.5.2. Pro: A less controversial example is that people sell pets for capitalistic gains
1.10.5.3. Pro: The more pets per person shows that it takes multiple lives to upkeep one life.
1.10.5.3.1. Pro: A person who has 10 pets for example, uses 10 lives to keep themselves happy. Those 10 lives give up their own freedom and happiness for one person.
1.10.5.3.1.1. Con: Many pets are rescued from abusive conditions and adopted into loving homes where they have more freedom and happiness than they experienced previously.
1.10.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: Adopting a pet from rescue shelters saves their lives. In many cases they would be put to death.
1.10.5.3.1.2. Con: That an animal or animals live with humans does not mean they are giving up any happiness.
1.10.5.3.2. Pro: If a pet eats meat, multiple lives are sacrificed to support a person's life
1.10.5.3.3. Con: Having more than one pet is not an indicator of a person's life needing upkeep. There are many reasons people have more than one pet.
1.10.5.3.3.1. Pro: Many people have multiple pets for the happiness and well-being of their pets \(by providing them shelter and care that they otherwise would not get in their current or future situations\).
1.10.5.3.3.2. Pro: People might take animals in to counteract species extinction, such as [Richard Branson buying an island for endangered lemurs to boost their current population](https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/why-we-love-lemurs).
1.10.5.3.3.2.1. Pro: Islands are like pet cages for billionaires.
1.10.5.3.3.3. Pro: People might buy pets to bring about awareness of issues that could bring mass action to decrease inhumanities brought on by the pet industry.
1.10.5.3.3.3.1. Pro: An example is someone adopting a pet from an animal shelter for an event to talk about overbreeding issues and then it back to the animal shelter. Then the message sent to the audience would create an impact when people buy and breed less animals.
1.10.5.4. Pro: Using a pet to be happy without allowing a pet to be free so they could be happy is a good example.
1.10.5.4.1. Con: Animals do not perceive freedom as we do. Happiness is sometimes more likely to occur if you provide for it rather than letting it free \(i.e. are strays happier than pets?\)
1.10.6. Con: Keeping pets gives cultures a capability to perpetuate colonial stereotypes \(such as the  [South African president saying keeping pets is part of "white culture"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-africa-president-pets-are-white-culture/)\).
1.10.6.1. Pro: These stereotypes perpetuate misinformation. As with example above, the South African president fails to mention how many dog breeds were started in Africa, such as the [Basenji from the Congo](http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/basenji#/slide/1).
1.11. Con: Keeping pets supports the pet industry's darker side.
1.11.1. Con: This is only true to the extent that we actually buy pets from pet shops.
1.11.1.1. Con: Pet shops are only part of the pet industry and is not the only component of the darker side. Pet food, laws, and more encompass it.
1.11.1.2. Pro: Adopting stray/sheltered animals does not contribute to the dark side of the pet industry as much.
1.11.2. Pro: Over-breeding causes [genetic health conditions to emerge](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/although-purebred-dogs-can-be-best-in-show-are-they-worst-in-health/). To produce an animal that will suffer in life is not morally right.
1.11.2.1. Con: Many pets do not come from breeders.
1.11.2.1.1. Pro: [According to a survey](https://www.animalsheltering.org/page/pets-by-the-numbers), 44% of dogs and 47% of cats are adopted from shelters while only 25% of dogs and 4 % of cats are bought from breeders.
1.11.3. Pro: Breeders look down upon pets that do not come out correctly after breeding \(such as a nose too big or a gait too small\), which creates psychologically negative behaviors in humans \(such as perfectionist attitudes, neglect, superiority...\).
1.11.4. Con: Millions of unwanted animals need caring environments. You can adopt or rescue without supporting the pet industry.
1.11.5. Pro: One of the dark sides to the pet industry is [puppy mills](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills).
1.11.6. Pro: People who want a pet after seeing someone with one will go to breeders without thinking about how the animal came into existence.
1.11.7. Con: California is trying to get away from these sides by [making pet stores only sell rescue animals](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/us/california-pet-stores.html).
1.11.7.1. Pro: Without adopting rescue animals as pets, there would be millions more animals struggling to survive in the streets.
1.11.8. Pro: Buying certain pets supports crime, as [wildlife are the commodity of illegal pet trades](http://abcnewsradioonline.com/world-news/sloths-hottest-selling-animal-in-colombias-illegal-pet-trade.html).
1.11.9. Pro: Supply and demand causes many animals to get abandoned when the supply is more than the demand could keep up with.
1.12. Con: Keeping pets threatens endangered species if animals are taken out of the wild for pets, such as exotic pets.
1.12.1. Con: This is only true for exotic pets, not domesticated. Therefore this is no reason why someone shouldn't get a pet but for someone not to captivate endangered and exotic species.
1.12.1.1. Pro: Domesticated animals are incredibly successful in terms of evolutionary survival, while their more capable relatives are more scarce as a result of climate change.
1.12.1.2. Con: Domesticated animals get affected by being endangered as well through evolutionary survival.
1.12.1.2.1. Pro: Taking domesticated animals out of the wild decreased the species that the domesticated animal was taken from.
1.12.1.2.2. Pro: The reason is that domesticated animals are not surviving through evolution, but instead through adaptation and artificial selection. In the wild \(due to no one owning a pet anymore\), their species may not survive.
1.12.1.2.2.1. Pro: If domesticated animals were to survive through evolution, then they would need to start from when they were taken out of the wild \(as that was the last time they participated in evolution\) and go on from there.
1.12.1.2.3. Pro: If domesticated animals get released into the wild, they could become feral, if not invasive, which ruins the ecosystem. The damages hurts their \(and native animals'\) chances of survival within that environment.
1.12.2. Pro: When exotic animals are taken out of their native habitat, the animals left in the wild could suffer from genetic diseases, which further threatens their species. This happens from a smaller gene pool.
1.12.3. Con: This debate is not about whether people should keep wild endangered animals as pets. It's about whether keeping pets in general is justified or wrong.
1.12.4. Pro: One of the examples is the [clownfish, due to the media popularity of 'Finding Nemo'](https://undiscoveredcreatures.wordpress.com/tag/pangolin-as-pet/).
