Discussion Title: Should ISIS fighters be allowed to return home?

1. Those who fight for ISIS should be denied reentry by their home countries.
1.1. Con: There should be a chance for repentance, rehabilitation and reintegration for those who made the mistake of joining ISIS and regretted it.
1.1.1. Pro: Returning fighters are [temporarily disengaged](https://www.hsaj.org/articles/14263) from their ties to the group, offering an opportunity for therapy and rehabilitation.
1.1.1.1. Con: They will still have access to [online](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/isis-winning-online-war-propaganda-extremist-material-radicalisation-report-facebook-twitter-social-a7954246.html) extremist material that is unregulated. The lack of control and oversight over their online activities will reinforce the violent ideology of ISIS, potentially undermining the efficacy of any attempts to rehabilitate them.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: This could easily be remedied by having limited or monitored internet access as a caveat to the rehabilitation process.
1.1.2. Pro: Not everyone who joined ISIS was an ideological fanatic.
1.1.2.1. Pro: At the beginning of the conflict in Syria, people who signed up to support the uprising against Assad [may not have realized](https://www.hsaj.org/articles/14263) what collaboration with ISIS would entail.
1.1.2.2. Pro: A number of young people joined ISIS out of [naïvety or brainwashing](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/naive-young-jihadis-should-rejoin-society-without-facing-court-says-watchdog-a3662891.html).
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: ISIS produce propaganda [specifically designed](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-graham/who-joins-isis-and-why_b_8881810.html) to prey upon their insecurities and persecution complexes of disenfranchised young people.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: Naivety is not a reasonable defense for murder, treason, desertion, or any other serious offense in which another individual's life is put at risk or ended.
1.1.2.3. Pro: [Among those interviewed,](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/12/why-people-join-isis/419685/) foreign fighters from places like the United States and Western Europe were "far more likely to be facing some sort of [identity crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/world/americas/isis-online-recruiting-american.html), a desire for a personal sense of recognition that ISIS can provide. They were also more likely to be motivated by a rejection of Western culture."
1.1.2.4. Pro: [Research](https://www.fpri.org/article/2017/09/isis-recruiting-not-just-ideological/) communities in Europe all agree that there is no one single profile of a jihadist suggesting that a number of factors, not all of which are ideological, must be considered to predict how an individual is radicalized.
1.1.2.5. Pro: [Research](https://www.fpri.org/article/2017/09/isis-recruiting-not-just-ideological/) shows that recruits are not ideologically driven at the outset of recruitment, and that they are radicalized by having their emotional, social, and political aspirations preyed upon by recruiters through the use of [narratives](https://www.fpri.org/article/2017/09/isis-recruiting-not-just-ideological/).
1.1.2.6. Con: Regardless of ideology, recruits joined ISIS with the intention of harming and killing others in service of the Islamic State, which is equally morally unacceptable.
1.1.2.7. Pro: A lot of people didn't choose to join ISIS. Some kids were taken with their parents.
1.1.2.7.1. Con: The vast majority of kids are unlikely to have engaged in warfare or acts of terror.
1.1.2.7.2. Con: If a child was taken and did not commit crimes then they can be returned home.
1.1.2.7.3. Pro: [Sally Jones](https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/middle-east/84168766/sally-jones-to-mrs-terror-the-movements-of-britains-most-wanted-woman), a notorious propagandist and female recruiter for ISIS, brought her 9-yr old son from the UK to Syria with her where he was routinely indoctrinated and trained to become a child soldier.
1.1.2.7.4. Pro: [Bilal Tagirov](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/02/the-lost-children-of-isis/) was only 4-years old when he was brought to Syria by his father, who took the child from their home in Chechnya to join ISIS without the permission of his mother.
1.1.2.7.5. Pro: According to the Russian authorities, there are over [600 open inquiries](http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-russia-isis-baby-20171026-story.html) into missing children who were taken by their parents to Iraq and Syria; however it is estimated that the number should actually be much higher since there are likely hundreds more families who are too scared or ashamed to come forward.
1.1.2.8. Pro: Harsh economic realities and the promise of a better life in ISIS may have driven some to join.
1.1.2.8.1. Con: Foreign ISIS recruitment is [positively correlated](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22190) with GDP per capita and the Human Development Index, indicating that ideology may play a more significant role in motivating a foreign fighter than a lack of economic development.
1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.1.4. Con: According to a report, most returnees were [never](http://thesoufancenter.org/research/beyond-caliphate/) integrated in the first place. Therefore the possibility of successfully integrating them into society would be highly unlikely \(p. 27, par. 2\).
1.1.5. Con: Government policy of rehabilitation and reintegration of returnees is ineffective.
1.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.1.5.2. Pro: A deradicalization [strategy](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-uncovered/what-should-west-do-fighters-returning-syria-iraq-n800261) in France, that was designed to reintegrate and rehabilitate people who were vulnerable to extremism, failed to achieve results. The fact that the program failed to affect change in those who were vulnerable to extremism means that it would be highly unlikely to integrate and rehabilitate returnees whose convictions in extremist ideology have been emboldened by their experiences abroad.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Followers of ISIS may have personally crossed an ideological barrier from which they cannot be "rehabilitated."
1.1.5.4. Pro: The reason why so many foreign fighters are [second-generation immigrants](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2005-07-01/europes-angry-muslims) is because many countries fail to properly integrate immigrants into society in the first place; therefore it makes no sense to expect that those same governments could successfully reintegrate those who are already disillusioned.
1.1.6. Con: Those who went to fight for ISIS do not deserve a chance to rehabilitate into society.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Selected ISIS fighters do not, by dint of their nationality, deserve to be able to escape the consequences of their actions in the countries they have destabilised.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Those who fought for ISIS in Iraq face the [death penalty](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-foreign-fighters-iraq-prosecuted-death-penalty-families-mosul-a7987831.html), the legal punishment they were aware of before joining the group. Citizenship of another country does not mean the rules of the country in which you committed the crime do not apply.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Con: Many Western states do not extradite criminals if they will face the death penalty upon their return to the country where they committed their crimes on the basis that this would be subjecting them to cruel and unusual punishment, so if anything this is another reason to allow them to return.
1.1.6.1.1.2. Con: Many of the foreign fighters who joined ISIS were [young, naive, and largely unaware](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/world/americas/isis-online-recruiting-american.html) of what exactly they were getting themselves into.
1.1.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: Their naiveté and radicalization by way of manipulation should be taken into account when choosing an appropriate punishment for them.
1.1.6.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: According to psychology, individuals are able to derive conclusions from their actions. If one commits a mistake \(like becoming a foreign fighter out of naivety or being ignorant of ISIS's true nature\) but then is enlightened by facts and human stories about the web of lies which mislead him/her, one is later able to distinguish between truth and lies.
Of course this greatly depends on whether one is given a true opportunity to reintegrate into society - or left with only extremists as "family".
1.1.6.1.1.2.2. Con: If an individual is naive enough to be convinced to leave their country of origin to commit attrocities on others, they may be easily convinced to do so again once they return.
1.1.6.1.1.2.2.1. Con: What an individual may or may not do is not so easily predictable, especially in cases of naivety, which is not a malignant disorder; and a concept which does not belong in a legal decision for punishment. The issue is that an individual chose to join ISIS, not that they're naive. If that choice is found to be because of naivety \(a concept based on education, age, and experience\), then an individual warrants rehabilitation; and punishment can be judged based on more pertinent factors.
1.1.6.1.2. Con: ISIS fighters could still be prosecuted once returned to their home countries.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Those who join ISIS are complicit in, and implicitly support, [murder](http://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/videos/hell-on-earth-the-fall-of-syria-and-the-rise-of-isis/beheadings-in-syria-5173.aspx) and [torture](http://www.newsweek.com/torture-methods-isis-revealed-sitting-severed-heads-fuel-dousing-and-flying-650828), as well as the [persecution](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-throws-gay-men-off-tower-stones-woman-accused-of-adultery-and-crucifies-17-young-men-in-9986410.html) of minorities. Such crimes cross a threshold beyond which states should not attempt to rehabilitate people, but rather ensure they are not a member of the national community.
1.1.6.3. Pro: [A majority](http://opinium.co.uk/government-british-jihadists/) of UK adults believe that the government should deny ISIS fighters from returning to the UK, and that they can never be re-integrated back into UK society. Therefore allowing them back into the country would be nothing short of undemocratic.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: In the UK's representative democracy, it is parliament specifically that is sovereign. When a representative is voted for, the people empower that representative to make decisions on their behalf and based on their own judgement, and not to merely uncritically respond to public opinion.
1.1.6.3.2. Con: It is illegitimate for the majority to vote to take away the rights of the minority.
1.1.6.4. Pro: Joining ISIS should be treated as an act of high treason and/or participating in mass murder. Those people can be allowed back only if incarcerated for life.
1.1.7. Pro: People deserve a second chance to repent and rehabilitate into society, regardless of how awful the crime they committed was.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Forgiveness is a [virtue](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/forgiveness/#ForgVirt) that is characteristic of a state that treats all of its citizens with compassion.
1.1.7.1.1. Con: Forgiveness often conflicts with justice, which is another key [virtue](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-virtue/) of a successful state.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Revenge is a natural psychological impulse, but has a number of [harmful effects](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/the-complicated-psychology-of-revenge) on those who desire it.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: Not wanting to reintegrate terrorists back into society isn't about vengeance; it's a matter of prioritizing justice over mercy.
1.1.7.3. Pro: Stripping citizenship from an individual is an arbitrary punishment outside of the usual criminal justice system as it removes the possibility of rehabilitation totally.
1.1.8. Con: The probability of rehabilitation is very low - the fighters likely defected because they were losing, not because of any ideological shift.
1.1.8.1. Pro: Most terrorist groups explicitly recognize that membership will be transitory and have processes to allow members to “retire.” [Around 15% of members](https://ctc.usma.edu/disengagement-or-deradicalization-a-look-at-prison-programs-for-jailed-terrorists/) organically disengage from terrorist organizations each year.
1.1.9. Pro: Further disenfranchisement serves no purpose and perpetuates the cycle with potentially disastrous outcomes. There are examples of former terrorists successfully counselling others to reintegrate them.
1.1.10. Con: If terrorist crimes are met with mercy and forgiveness instead of justice and punishment, then there is nothing to stop others from becoming foreign fighters in the future.
1.1.10.1. Pro: It is difficult to assess the sincerity of a fighter's defection, so repatriation would become a punishment-free way for terrorists to escape a war zone.
1.1.10.2. Pro: If countries consistently refuse entry to former foreign fighters, prospective recruits will know it is unlikely they will ever see their family or friends in the state they are departing from again.
1.1.10.3. Pro: Denying protection to returning fighters can act as a deterrent against new supporters joining ISIS.
1.1.10.3.1. Con: An individual who is in such a mindset that they would join ISIS is unlikely to rationally consider a deterrent of this nature.
1.1.10.3.1.1. Con: Some people join ISIS as the result of rational considerations and may be influenced by deterrence.
1.1.10.3.1.1.1. Pro: Interviews with former fighters indicate [a set of consistent, rational motivations](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/12/why-people-join-isis/419685/) for joining ISIS-- some of which would be influenced by deterrence.
1.1.10.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Those interviewed](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/12/why-people-join-isis/419685/) who joined ISIS or similar groups from another Muslim country were most motivated by “assisting Muslim ‘brothers’ and fighting the Assad regime \(45 percent\)." “Internal fighters believe they have a mission to defend their community \(duty, Jihad\) but they also have personal interests \(money, staying alive\),” according to the report.
1.1.10.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.1.10.3.1.1.2. Pro: ISIS provide good wages, a supportive atmosphere and an attractive from of radical Islamist culture: they appeal to people [rationally](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-graham/who-joins-isis-and-why_b_8881810.html) as well as irrationally, and some make a decision on this basis.
1.1.10.3.1.2. Pro: Many who join ISIS believe they are going to die fighting anyway, so the idea of not being able to return home would not concern them.
1.1.10.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.2.
1.1.10.4. Pro: There should be a lesson for such people who joined a terrorist group like ISIS or are interested in supporting any similar organizations in the future. All doors should be closed.
1.1.10.5. Con: A policy of intimidation towards terrorists has only proved to escalate violence and anti-West sentiment.
1.1.10.6. Con: It is not a terrorist crime to defect from a terrorist group and return home. It is one thing to criminally prosecute a person and another entirely to deny their right to return to their home and family.
1.1.10.6.1. Con: If they committed crimes such as murder and terrorism then they would get a life sentence. Thus it makes no sense to let them go home instead of serving time in a jail.
1.1.10.6.1.1. Con: This is not necessarily the case, as there are numerous countries that have [abolished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment) life imprisonment.
1.1.10.6.1.2. Con: Presumably upon returning to their home country, any returning foreign fighter would be arrested and tried before a court for their crimes. This, therefore, isn't a question of going home vs. going to prison, but whether or not they should serve that potential prison time in their home country.
1.1.11. Pro: The people that choose to fight for ISIS were not only a product of external influence but a product of the environment they grew up in. When a similar form of extremism occurs within a country's borders rather than abroad, the country should also take responsibility.
1.1.11.1. Con: Countries can take responsibility without allowing reentry.
1.1.12. Pro: They could potentially work for public benefit enforced and supervised by the state.
1.1.13. Pro: Denying the right of return to one's home and family to a broad category of people without considering their specific backgrounds is morally wrong.
1.1.13.1. Pro: Some 'foreign fighters' have children who should be protected by their government \(and parents\). It is unethical to allow the children to return without their mother/father.
1.1.13.1.1. Con: The children should be protected but allowing a criminal to return home because they have children would make the whole justice system irrelevant.
1.1.13.2. Con: The people made a choice to forfeit their rights when they left to join terrorists attacking their 'home and family'. The morally right thing to do is to ensure they can't harm the citizens of the country they left.
1.1.14. Con: If someone has been turned radical it is very hard for them to stop, putting them back in their home where people can convince them to join ISIS again won't help.
1.1.14.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.
1.1.14.2. Con: Rehabilitation and reintegration dose not imply that we let these people go back to a unsupervised life. Through imprisonment and parole we can safely proceed with different forms of integration programs.
1.1.15. Con: If we allow supposed "defectors" back, ISIS will undoubtedly use the "defector" tag to get into a country. ISIS may have trained some people to feign regret in order to re-enter normal society, only to later engage in violence.
1.1.15.1. Con: [Modern psychology](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0093950) is able to distinguish between fake and true remorse.
1.1.16. Pro: Their countries of origin have a responsibility to take these fighters back and help them become nonviolent productive members of society. No one else is responsible for their future, except their home countries and themselves. And capable ISIS fighters have overcome many obstacles and can become successful in almost any environment.
1.1.17. Con: Foreign fighters shouldn't be allowed to return home unless they demonstrate a clear and sustained willingness to rehabilitate prior to returning, rather than the other way around.
1.1.18. Pro: If it's proven beyond a reasonable doubt that they participated, they should be subject to mandatory psychiatric assessment and a review of what they've demonstrated to have done. Most of these guys need therapy more than anything, alienating them further doesn't solve the problem it just externalizes it.
1.1.19. Pro: Foreign fighters have joined causes because of economic opportunities, religious beliefs, seeking adventure and from peer pressure. Young men from the West have been doing this for hundreds of years in numerous conflicts and it is hypocritical to treat young Muslim men worse who have pursued the same life choices. Point elaborated here: [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rbuu06mIa4).
1.1.19.1. Con: It is still a complete betrayal of their nation to join an enemy army. The consequence for joining an army that is the nation's enemy should be the termination of citizenship, regardless of their religious beliefs, economic opportunities, adventure seeking etc.
1.1.20. Con: These fighters do not deserve a chance at reintegration because it would be hypocritical to offer them the leniency they denied to their opponents.
1.1.20.1. Pro: There are millions of humanitarian migrants and refugees who are homeless and living in dangerous situations because of the actions of ISIS fighters. Combatants should not be allowed to return to Western countries and escape responsibility for their own actions unless they disarm and work in a reconstruction effort, and reconcile with the people they abused. It's not fair for the West to forgive them for crimes committed in the East.
1.1.20.2. Pro: ISIS has committed [genocide against the Yazidis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_of_Yazidis_by_ISIL) and is intent on [eliminating and expelling them](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/26/the-daring-plan-to-save-a-religious-minority-from-isis) from their homeland.
1.1.21. Pro: Many of [the ISIS supporters who wish to return](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/world/isis-returning-fighters/?utm_term=.e5cd253dfbf6) were not directly involved in the planning or execution of the group's worst attacks, and do not deserve to be refused entry on the basis of those.
1.1.21.1. Pro: Some people who travel to join ISIS become victims of the group's abhorrent practices.
1.1.21.1.1. Pro: Women and girls as young as nine face widespread [sexual abuse](https://nypost.com/2015/04/11/isis-impregnates-9-year-old-girl/) at the hands of husbands they are forced to marry and other male ISIS members.
1.1.21.1.2. Pro: Once you have arrived and joined ISIS, it is [not possible to leave](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2808015/ISIS-threatens-kill-British-jihadis-want-return-home.html) other than by attempting to escape, for which the punishment, if caught, is death.
1.1.21.1.3. Pro: [Jejoen Bontinck](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/01/journey-to-jihad), a Belgian teenager who was radicalized and traveled to Syria to join ISIS, regretted his decision shortly after arriving and appeared unenthusiastic. Consequently, his fellow members imprisoned him with other ISIS hostages for his betrayal.
1.1.21.2. Con: Though one cannot deny that they chose to join ISIS without heeding the warnings about what they were getting themselves into.
1.1.21.3. Con: ISIS recruits still provided material support to the terrorist organization, and are thus morally responsible.
1.1.21.4. Con: There is no real way to differentiate the supporters who were not involved directly in the worst attacks.
1.1.21.5. Pro: Foreign fighters are given [menial roles](https://www.worldcrunch.com/world-affairs/a-quiet-wave-of-european-muslims-sets-out-for-war-in-syria/europe-combatants-salafism-syrian-rebels-islam/c1s11335#.VPz8YMbbxAm), such as disposing of dead bodies, because they are distrusted by locals.
1.1.21.5.1. Con: This does not negate the original intentions of foreign fighters, as their joining ISIS was likely based on a desire to participate in less menial and less benign activities.
1.1.21.5.2. Con: Many foreign fighters are given important roles in operations and combat.
1.1.21.5.2.1. Pro: [Junaid Hussain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junaid_Hussain) was a British foreign fighter who led many of ISIS' cyber operations.
1.1.21.5.2.2. Pro: [Abdelhamid Abaaoud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdelhamid_Abaaoud) was a Belgian foreign fighter who went on to coordinate the 2015 Paris attacks.
1.1.21.5.2.3. Pro: [Torleif Angel Sanchez Hammer](https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/torleif-23-er-is-norske-skarpskytter/60831514) is a Norwegian foreign fighter who became a sniper for ISIS.
1.1.21.5.2.4. Pro: ["Jihadi John"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadi_John) was a British foreign fighter who is believed to have been the executioner in numerous ISIS beheading videos.
1.2. Pro: Extending leniency towards members of ISIS would undermine efforts to fight ISIS and other terror groups overseas.
1.2.1. Pro: If members of ISIS are allowed to return and live at home without punishment, they might later redeploy [to a different region](http://thesoufancenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Beyond-the-Caliphate-Foreign-Fighters-and-the-Threat-of-Returnees-TSC-Report-October-2017.pdf) to support other terrorist organizations: "...other areas where \[the Islamic State\] has established wilayat also provide destinations for foreign recruits."
1.2.1.1. Pro: The Islamic State has expanded into South East Asia, and [foreign fighters](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/03/world/asia/isis-fighters-philippines-indonesia.html?action=click&contentCollection=Asia%20Pacific&module=RelatedCoverage&region=EndOfArticle&pgtype=article) were involved in the IS-led [battle for Marawi](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/world/asia/isis-philippines-mindanao-marawi.html) in Southern Philippines.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Most foreign fighters active in the Philippines were from neighboring countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia; there is no evidence to indicate wide recruitment in the West or that former fighters might redeploy.
1.2.1.2. Pro: The Islamic State has expressed territorial claims and has been militarily active in [Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant_in_Libya).
1.2.1.3. Pro: Militant groups without territorial claims who have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State have been operating in countries such as [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant_%E2%80%93_Sinai_Province), [Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant_%E2%80%93_Yemen_Province), [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant_%E2%80%93_Algeria_Province), [Pakistan and Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant_%E2%80%93_Khorasan_Province), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant_%E2%80%93_Caucasus_Province) and the [Gaza strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Omar_Hadid_Brigade).
1.2.1.4. Pro: [Boko Haram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boko_Haram), a militant group active in several West African countries and with territorial claims in Nigeria, pledged allegiance to the Islamic state.
1.2.1.5. Con: With the right of returning home, people who defected from ISIS can resume their previous lives. Without being able to return home, the option to continue participating in anti-social behavior is much more attractive and perhaps the only option possible.
1.2.2. Pro: IS has [remotely directed attacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/asia/isis-messaging-app-terror-plot.html?action=click&contentCollection=Asia%20Pacific&module=RelatedCoverage&region=EndOfArticle&pgtype=article) from across the world, so allowing their supporters to remain in any country poses a threat.
1.2.2.1. Con: IS handlers are typically based in Syria and work with larger networks and support than a lone returning fighter would have access to.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Many "lone wolf" attacks have been at the direction of ISIS members abroad who used nothing more than the internet to orchestrate and communicate plans.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: It is very hard to confirm whether "lone wolf" attacks were in fact orchestrated and directed by ISIS, or whether ISIS claimed responsibility for them post factum.
1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Often the perpetrators of "lone wolf" attacks are killed by the police or commit suicide as part of their attacks, making it hard to ascertain their motives.
1.2.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Since terrorist networks have a vast online presence, disproving an attack as being carried out by a "lone wolf" is often a simple matter of following their online footprint and accessing the history of their messaging apps.
1.2.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Lone wolves may sympathise with larger groups and even consider themselves to be part of them, while in reality not actually being part of those networks.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: A number of terrorists who were thought by the authorities to have been inspired by ISIS to carry out attacks as lone wolves [were later found out](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/asia/isis-messaging-app-terror-plot.html) to have been recruited and directed by ISIS operatives remotely.
1.2.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: It was discovered that a series of lone wolf attacks in Germany and France were all [controlled remotely](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/09/terror-plots-in-germany-france-were-remote-controlled-by-islamic-state-operatives.php) by members of ISIS' network.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: In 2016 two young men [murdered a priest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Normandy_church_attack) in front of his congregation in Normandy, France after being recruited and directed by ISIS via the messaging app Telegram.
1.2.2.1.1.2.3. Pro: The foiled 2015 attack in Garland, Texas was carried out by two men who had [online contact](https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/07/politics/fbi-warning-elton-simpson-cartoon-event-attack/) with known jihadists overseas; and investigators believe that those jihadists were responsible for encouraging the attack in Texas.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: Many returning fighters either have [established networks](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-03-29/lone-wolves-no-more) at home already, or can create new ones by leveraging the connections and training they made while fighting abroad.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: Both the [2015 Paris Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks) and the [2016 Brussels Bombings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Brussels_bombings) were carried out by teams that were part of a network which included members who had previously spent time training with ISIS in the Levant.
1.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: Mohammed Merah, a returned foreign fighter who killed seven people in France in the name of al Qaeda, was linked to a [network of local extremists](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/mar/30/myth-lone-wolf-terrorist) who went on to carry out attacks in France, Libya, Syria, and Iraq.
1.2.2.1.2.3. Pro: Even if they do not commit an attack themselves, they might support other covert subversive or destabilizing activities.
1.2.2.1.2.4. Con: However, if there is an exception for those who are meaningfully motivated to at least partially undo whatever damaging they did, if they show true remorse and truly integrate into society, burying a hatchet is a great strategy to win.
1.2.3. Pro: People might be more likely to join terrorist groups in the future if they see it as a reversible decision.
1.2.4. Pro: Allowing ISIS terrorists to re-enter society will allow them to further influence Islam as a whole, legitimizing their radical ideology rather than erasing it from the Earth.
1.2.5. Pro: A drug addict doesn't necessarily care who is selling the drug so long as the drug produces the effects the buyer is after. An ISIS member, if compared to a drug user, is going to purchase wherever the drug is available. If we have an intelligence community worth its salt, they'd know how to keep the country concerned safe from the user. One must know the tactics of the enemy and cancel them out at the borders before chaos ensues. False flags are a product of that community, it's a wrong hat.
1.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.3.
1.2.7. Con: On the contrary, in the context where ISIS is facing total military defeat a deterrent of this nature could persuade discontented and demoralised recruits to remain fighting, rather than attempt to return home. This strengthens the position of ISIS.
1.2.7.1. Con: A policy that encourages ISIS fighters to remain in a situation where they are facing total military defeat will lead to more of them being captured or killed, which is historically the most effective deterrent to radical Islamists.
1.2.7.2. Con: It does not matter how strong ISIS is in the Middle East. At least the West should always be ahead of them militarily and it can be contained there. Let them in to our society and they can influence and infiltrate to the highest levels of government.
1.2.7.2.1. Con: Disallowing reintegration of ISIS fighters could promote anti-Western sentiment, especially when crushing ISIS by military force.
1.2.7.2.2. Con: Foreign soldiers or enemy combatants haven't been recorded to ever infiltrate into the highest level of government.
1.2.7.2.3. Con: It is unethical to treat the Middle East as simply a containment cell for terrorism. Millions of civilians live in these countries and have endured more first-hand suffering at the hands of terrorists than just about anyone is the West has. Since a large percentage of these terrorists come from Western countries, the least those countries could do is hold their citizens accountable for their actions.
1.3. Pro: Public opinion is strongly against allowing foreign fighters to return.
1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.
1.3.2. Pro: It is likely that returning fighters will face an extremely negative social reaction, meaning even if initially repentant, they are likely to re-radicalise.
1.3.2.1. Pro: According to interviews conducted by the US Pentagon, [the challenges of reintegrating](https://www.hsaj.org/articles/14263) after returning home can cause terrorist defectors to return to the group.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: According to the [NPS Center for Homeland Defense and Security,](https://www.hsaj.org/articles/14263) "Alongside the motivations for joining, the problems facing foreign fighters back home—factors that played in their decisions to join such as high unemployment, underemployment, discrimination, marginalization, difficulty living a conservative Salafi lifestyle in the West, messy and unsatisfying family relationships that they had fled—all still existed as problems once they returned home."
1.3.2.2. Pro: When returning fighters are apprehended by the authorities, their treatment may [generate resentment](https://www.hsaj.org/articles/14263) and increase danger to society upon release.
1.3.3. Pro: [A Pew survey](http://thesoufancenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Beyond-the-Caliphate-Foreign-Fighters-and-the-Threat-of-Returnees-TSC-Report-October-2017.pdf) published on August 1, 2017 found that the fear of an attack by the so-called Islamic State \(IS\) ranked first in global concerns. Given this, the public is likely to be afraid and unwelcoming towards any returning fighters.
1.3.3.1. Pro: In the context of this fear, the perception of fighters returning and being treated leniently is likely to increase Islamophobic sentiment more generally. This will increase the capacity of ISIS to recruit as more Muslims will feel alienated from their home countries.
1.3.4. Con: A national [study](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/young-british-muslims-uk-isis-fighters-syria-return-reintegrate-society-research-a7682836.html) found young British Muslims across the UK - the demographic mostly closely approximating the returnee fighters - believe they should be allowed to return home and be reintegrated into society.
1.3.4.1. Pro: As the group that might be asked to receive or participate in reintegrating former ISIS fighters, young British Muslims may have the best insight into whether reintegration is possible.
1.3.4.2. Pro: As a group that may have been targeted as potential recruits by ISIS, young British Muslims may understand and be able to effectively support rehabilitation for people who did in fact join the Islamic State's cause.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Non-Islamist Muslims have been most hurt by the Islamophobia generated by ISIS, therefore, the fact that they would be willing to forgive and help former ISIS members integrate back into society is more poignant than non-Muslims willing to help them reintegrate.
1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.2.
1.3.6. Con: Public representatives should make decisions based on their own judgement and moral compass, and not just respond uncritically to public opinion.
1.4. Pro: Allowing foreign fighters to return home could be a potential threat to national security.
1.4.1. Pro: Foreign fighters could attempt to carry out attacks in their home country.
1.4.1.1. Pro: The recent slew of terrorist attacks in Western countries have [demonstrated](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/raqqa-isis-syria-uk-terror-attacks-likely-increase-despite-defeat-islamic-state-west-radicalisation-a8007721.html) that as ISIS moves closer to a total military defeat, the more it focuses on attacks in the West. Operatives returned to their home countries can be a vital asset to them in this context.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: As ISIS loses ground in the Middle East, increasing the frequency of attacks in the West signals that it remains strong and relevant as a flag-bearer of radical Islamism. This helps ISIS compete with other terrorist groups for funding from those sympathetic to their cause.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: This incentivises ISIS to also claim responsibility for attacks that weren't actually committed by individuals with an ISIS connection, which makes it harder to ascertain whether its increased activity in the West is premeditated or not.
1.4.1.2. Pro: European recruits are offered a seven-month [training](http://thesoufancenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Beyond-the-Caliphate-Foreign-Fighters-and-the-Threat-of-Returnees-TSC-Report-October-2017.pdf) period to carry out terrorist attacks abroad. From this group, those that return home are the most vicious and determined of returnees who desire to carry out terrorist attacks.
1.4.1.3. Pro: ISIS propaganda is heavily anti-West, even encouraging "[all out war](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-ramadan-2017-all-out-war-west-new-terror-attacks-manchester-suicide-bombing-islamic-state-a7758121.html)" against Western countries.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: The Islamist groups active in Syria and Iraq, including ISIS, are [not especially interested](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/homeward-bounddont-hype-the-threat-of-returning-jihadists/) in attacking Europe or the United States. Instead, their focus is on fighting Shiites and local regimes.
1.4.1.3.2. Pro: One of the core ideologies espoused by ISIS supporters is that of provoking the Western powers to bring about the [prophesied conflict](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/) on the plains of Dabiq.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Foreign fighters who return for domestic operations are [more effective](http://hegghammer.com/_files/Hegghammer_-_Should_I_stay_or_should_I_go.pdf) in carrying out their attacks than non-veterans.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: The operational training that foreign fighters receive while abroad means that they know how to covertly plan, carry out, and maximize the damage of a terrorist attack.
1.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.4.1.4.1.2. Con: Former foreign fighters may have guerilla warfare skills, but are [unlikely to be trained in surveillance and high level covert operations](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/homeward-bounddont-hype-the-threat-of-returning-jihadists/) that would be necessary to successfully perpetrate an attack in the West.
1.4.1.4.2. Pro: One study suggests that the presence of a former terrorist veteran increases—[by a factor of around 1.5](http://hegghammer.com/_files/Hegghammer_-_Should_I_stay_or_should_I_go.pdf)—the probability that a plot will come to execution, and it doubles the likelihood that the plot will kill people.
1.4.1.4.3. Pro: [Sageman \(2010\)](http://hegghammer.com/_files/Hegghammer_-_Should_I_stay_or_should_I_go.pdf) examined 60 plots in the West
by 46 networks between 1993 and 2008, finding that
26 of the networks included a terrorist veteran and that a veteran doubled the probability of the attack reaching
execution.
1.4.1.4.4. Pro: British authorities said in 2008 that three-quarters of
post-9/11 UK plots can be “traced to Pakistan” [\(Coates and Page 2008\).](http://hegghammer.com/_files/Hegghammer_-_Should_I_stay_or_should_I_go.pdf)
1.4.1.5. Con: Historically, [very few](http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/16/opinion/hegghammer-isis-foreign-fighters/index.html) returning fighters have planned or carried out attacks in their home countries.
1.4.1.5.1. Con: The [2015 Charlie Hebdo shootings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo_shooting), [2015 Paris attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks), [2016 Brussels bombings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Brussels_bombings), [2012 Toulouse & Montauban shootings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse_and_Montauban_shootings), [2013 Boston Marathon bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombing), and [2013 Lee Rigby murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Lee_Rigby), to name a few, were all high-profile fatal attacks carried out by returning foreign fighters.
1.4.1.5.2. Con: Even if the majority of returning fighters do not end up posing a threat, just one successful attack could be devastating.
1.4.1.6. Con: Since ISIS is defeated, it is likely that most foreign fighters will no longer see any reason to fight for them.
1.4.1.6.1. Con: ISIS is known for heavily radicalizing and indoctrinating its recruits, therefore its members are unlikely to see defeat as a reason to stop fighting.
1.4.1.6.2. Con: Even if the fighters are unable to secure an Islamic State, they may still be motivated by extremist hate against the West.
1.4.1.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.3.
1.4.1.6.2.2. Pro: [Western intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_military_intervention_against_ISIL) in targeting ISIS may motivate returning fighters to perpetrate attacks in their home countries.
1.4.2. Pro: Foreign fighters could strengthen terrorist recruitment efforts in the country.
1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.4.2.2. Con: If foreign fighters are seeking to leave combat by returning to their home country, they are unlikely to become active in recruiting or home-grown terrorism efforts.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: It is hard to distinguish between those leaving combat and those pretending to, and ISIS are adept at circumventing any safeguards.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Some returning fighters are [actively instructed](https://www.hsaj.org/articles/14263) to return to the West to work in recruitment or otherwise serve the group's goals.
1.4.2.4. Pro: These individuals would have opportunities to disseminate their beliefs among other populations if allowed to move freely. Containing them in one region limits the long term damage that could be caused.
1.4.3. Pro: A [report](http://thesoufancenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Beyond-the-Caliphate-Foreign-Fighters-and-the-Threat-of-Returnees-TSC-Report-October-2017.pdf) found that whatever the reason ISIS fighters have for returning home, all returnees will pose some degree of risk to the safety of the population, rendering them a potential threat to national security.
1.4.4. Pro: Foreign fighters could be an inspiration and role model for people who are at risk of becoming radicalized.
1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.4.4.2. Pro: A report found that returnees may [exaggerate](http://thesoufancenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Beyond-the-Caliphate-Foreign-Fighters-and-the-Threat-of-Returnees-TSC-Report-October-2017.pdf) their exploits in Syria and Iraq to encourage sympathizers who never left home to make up for their lack of opportunity or lack of courage by taking local action.
1.4.5. Con: One of ISIS' primary recruitment tactics, and part of the logic behind their terrorist attacks in the West, is to create the perception of a crackdown against Muslims in the guise of a response to a security threat. Disallowing re-entry would feed into this propaganda, hence actually endangering national security further.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Banning the burkini as a direct response to the terrorist attacks in Nice in 2016 posited Muslims in general as responsible for the attack, making it harder for moderate Muslim figures to claim the West welcomed any Muslims who were not extremists \([Veikkola, p.65-6](https://tampub.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/102602/1513773671.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)\).
1.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.
1.4.7. Con: Any returning foreign fighters would likely be apprehended by law enforcement upon arrival.
1.4.7.1. Pro: The numbers of returning fighters are [low](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/us/politics/fewer-isis-fighters-returning-home.html), meaning arrest and/or surveillance is not that great of a burden upon governments.
1.4.7.2. Pro: From 2012-2014, near the beginning of the trend of returning fighters, European security officials [disrupted](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/homeward-bounddont-hype-the-threat-of-returning-jihadists/) at least five terrorist plots with possible links to Syrian foreign fighters.
1.4.8. Pro: It is extremely difficult to track every returning fighter, meaning that keeping tabs on their activities is impossible.
1.4.8.1. Pro: A former British security analyst [stated](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/isis-british-jihadis-return-uk-iraq-syria-report-islamic-state-fighters-europe-threat-debate-terror-a8017811.html) that many will "disappear from view".
1.4.9. Pro: To let terrorists back into the country can only weaken and destabilise the values that it stands for.
1.4.10. Pro: It would be easy enough for an ISIS agent to become a sleeper and re-enter their country of origin. With foreknowledge of the infrastructure and culture, it would only be a matter of time for them to be able to deploy a functioning plan and set assets in place to cause damage that could have been avoided by denying them re-entry at the onset. Regret is all fine and dandy. But better to sacrifice one life than many.
1.5. Pro: Governments lack effective strategies for dealing with returning fighters.
1.5.1. Con: British authorities have powers including Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures [\(TPIM\)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/terrorism-prevention-and-investigation-measures-act) to monitor returnees that may pose a terrorist threat to society.
1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.5.3. Con: Programs that are a part of the UK government's [Prevent strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prevent-strategy-2011) can be used to effectively deal with returning fighters.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Returnees can be referred to the [Channel](https://www.ltai.info/what-is-channel/) programme, through which they can be rehabilitated and reintegrated back into society.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: The Channel programme is voluntary, which means that returnees can not be legally required to attend.
1.5.3.2. Con: A [report](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/eroding-trust-20161017_0.pdf) concluded that the Prevent strategy suffers from multiple structural flaws, and that it is counterproductive.
1.5.3.3. Con: The Prevent strategy requires public support for it to be effective. However, a [poll](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/only-4-of-people-think-david-camerons-antiextremist-policy-works-a3215961.html) demonstrated that 96% of Britons think that the strategy is not keeping the country safe.
1.5.4. Con: Several prevention and deradicalization [programs](http://www.cbc.ca/cbcdocspov/features/radicalization-to-rehabilitation-how-does-canada-prepare-for-isis-returnees) exist in Canada.
1.5.5. Con: Several NATO members in Europe, including Germany, France and Denmark, have [active policies](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/2017/Also-in-2017/daesh-tackling-surge-returning-foreign-fighters-prevention-denmark-rehabilitation-programmes/EN/index.htm) of countering violent extremism, such as rehabilitation and prevention measures.
1.5.5.1. Con: French de-radicalization centers were a failure. No candidates actually completed the program, either leaving voluntarily or due to criminal convictions, and the centers were eventually [closed](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/2017/Also-in-2017/daesh-tackling-surge-returning-foreign-fighters-prevention-denmark-rehabilitation-programmes/EN/index.htm).
1.5.5.2. Con: In France, radicalized prisoners were [separated](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/06/25/534122917/inside-french-prisons-a-struggle-to-combat-radicalization) from the general prison population, but the program was deemed a failure and revoked.
1.5.6. Pro: The current system is under a lot of strain to address the problem, which is much politicised and under constant public scrutiny, resulting in pressure on law enforcement and security intelligence agencies to identify, monitor and neutralise returnees who pose a threat.
1.5.6.1. Pro: As many as [10-20% of graduates](https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/saudi-deradicalization-experiment) of the Saudi de-radicalization program \(including some former Guantanamo prisoners\) return to "illicit activity."
1.5.7. Pro: Preventing a return to violent extremism [requires](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/2017/Also-in-2017/daesh-tackling-surge-returning-foreign-fighters-prevention-denmark-rehabilitation-programmes/EN/index.htm) providing radicalised individuals with pragmatic help in rebuilding their lives - which in most cases, will not be possible for returning ISIS fighters.
1.5.7.1. Pro: The more effective de-radicalization programs provide members with material benefits, not just dialogue. [For example](https://ctc.usma.edu/disengagement-or-deradicalization-a-look-at-prison-programs-for-jailed-terrorists/), "graduates are moved to more lenient prison regimes, are released early, and in some cases receive special support with employment, housing and family. Realistically, these benefits, rather than the much hyped ideological dialogue, likely play the key role in successful disengagement."
1.5.8. Pro: De-radicalization programs [suffer from competing objectives](https://ctc.usma.edu/disengagement-or-deradicalization-a-look-at-prison-programs-for-jailed-terrorists/), caught in the tension between targeting behavior modification \("disengagement"\) or seeking ideological conversion.
1.5.9. Pro: A specialized rehab program should exist to address not only re-entry, but assimilation back into host cultures. This program will have random checkpoints that the former fighter must comply to for re-entry. These checkpoints should be to see how they are developing toward goals that they set during the enrollment into the program.
1.5.10. Pro: Prisons provide an environment in which former ISIS fighters could [radicalise](http://thesoufancenter.org/research/beyond-caliphate/) other prisoners.
1.5.10.1. Pro: A [British intelligence official](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-dept-leaders-reluctant-to-bring-isis-fighters-to-us-for-trial-even-as-prosecutors-push-to-make-a-case/2018/05/12/6445b6b2-53c3-11e8-abd8-265bd07a9859_story.html?utm_term=.b3493ae36e1f) has stated that there is concern about the possibility of radicalisation as a result of imprisonment.
1.5.10.2. Pro: A UK [study](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7487) found that prisons were 'breeding grounds' for radicalization, as they provided near-perfect conditions for radical ideologies to flourish.
1.5.10.3. Pro: Harsh conditions in prisons can make inmates vulnerable to radicalization or violent ideologies.
1.5.10.3.1. Pro: Research has found that Islamic terrorists feed on the bitterness and alienation that is currently ubiquitous in American prisons, putting the United States “at risk of facing the sort of homegrown terrorism currently plaguing other countries” \([Cilluffo and Saathoff, 2006: i and iv](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1745-9133.2009.00574.x)\).
1.5.10.4. Con: Former fighters could be imprisoned in individual cells or monitored closely to ensure they are not proselytizing.
1.5.10.4.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.2.
1.5.10.5. Con: Research shows that the [actual probability](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1745-9133.2009.00574.x) of prisoners becoming a terrorist threat to the US upon release is low.
1.5.10.6. Pro: Testifying before the U.S. Senate in 2013, Professor of International Communication Michael Waller [stated](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/waller_testimony_10_14_03.pdf) that radical Islamist groups: “dominate Muslim prison recruitment in the U.S. and seek to create a radicalized cadre of felons who will support their anti-American efforts. Estimates place the number of Muslim prison recruits at between 15–20% of the prison population.”
1.5.10.7. Pro: Well-known terrorists or those with an international record can become "[icons](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/06/25/534122917/inside-french-prisons-a-struggle-to-combat-radicalization)" in a prison environment.
1.5.10.8. Con: There is no concrete evidence to demonstrate a direct link between radicalization and imprisonment, nor has it been [empirically](https://www.icct.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICCT-Entenmann-Heide-Weggemans-Dorsey-Rehabilitation-for-Foreign-Fighters-December2015.pdf) proven.
1.5.11. Con: The ISIS issue is not individual "fighters", but the underlying social and political tension of the region. Individuals should not be punished apart from a fair trial. We need to focus on instability first.
1.5.12. Pro: Letting people's home country decide their fate opens the door for racism, segregation, and deportations, since 'ISIS combatant' is a vaguely defined term and many Western countries have a history of unfairly targeting Muslims.
1.6. Pro: ISIS supporters should be tried and convicted in the countries where they committed their crimes.
1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.6.2. Pro: Once ISIS is fully defeated and peace is restored, dealing with war crimes will be part of the important healing process for the new states, which is why it is important that they get to put the ISIS fighters to trial.
1.6.2.1. Con: Syria does not have the resources or \(currently\) the motivation to prosecute war crimes within its territories: the court that has the [ability](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-warcrimes/war-crimes-evidence-in-syria-overwhelming-not-all-can-be-pursued-u-n-idUSKBN1H22GN) to prosecute these crimes will either be the ICC or a tribunal established by it.
1.6.2.2. Pro: After WW2 Europe also had diminished resources, yet they prosecuted war criminals at Nuremberg. The United Nations should support and fund the prosecution if necessary.
1.6.3. Con: Many of the crimes committed by ISIS supporters would fall into the category of war crimes. [The International Criminal Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court) in Hague has the jurisdiction to prosecute for such crimes.
1.6.3.1. Con: According to the [universality principle](https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/international-law/universal-jurisdiction-in-international-law.php) of international law a state, or in this case the ICC can claim jurisdiction over certain crimes committed by any person in the world regardless of territory or nationality. Some international crimes should be prosecuted even if the territoriality principle would make it difficult, therefore the ICC can claim jurisdiction if the [state is party to the Rome Statute](https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&mtdsg_no=XVIII-10&chapter=18&lang=en) of the ICC but not in other cases. The ICC doesn't have exclusive jurisdiction everywhere.
1.6.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.1.
1.6.4. Pro: The terrorist's country of origin should not be responsible for the costly and burdensome process of prosecuting them.
1.6.4.1. Pro: There are [unique difficulties](https://www.criminallawandjustice.co.uk/features/Obtaining-Adducing-and-Contesting-Evidence-Abroad) associated with obtaining, adducing and contesting evidence obtained from abroad, particularly if it is a war-torn country in which record keeping is practically non-existent.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: Since ISIS was heavily reliant on social media as a means for propaganda and recruitment, there is likely easily accessible cyber-evidence to prosecute many returning foreign fighters.
1.6.4.1.2. Pro: Evidence is often only gathered by Western intelligence services, who are reluctant to allow it to be used in [open court](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/captured-isis-killers-may-never-face-justice-in-british-courts-wk29h2bn3) as criminal justice systems demand.
1.6.4.1.3. Pro: The US Justice department is [reluctant to recommend US trials](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-dept-leaders-reluctant-to-bring-isis-fighters-to-us-for-trial-even-as-prosecutors-push-to-make-a-case/2018/05/12/6445b6b2-53c3-11e8-abd8-265bd07a9859_story.html?utm_term=.b3493ae36e1f) for two British ISIS fighters on account of uncertainty about the strength of evidence.
1.6.4.2. Con: Severe crimes often have [extra-judicial jurisdiction](https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/jurisdiction) attached to them, meaning the court of the alleged criminal's nationality has the power to try these crimes.
1.6.5. Con: Returning ISIS fighters must be tried and possibly convicted in accordance with the laws of their home country.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Denying them re-entry is effectively declaring their guilt without a trial. This goes against all the norms of a liberal democracy.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: [Exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile) is recognised by [Article 9](http://www.un.org/en/udhrbook/pdf/udhr_booklet_en_web.pdf) of the UN Declaration of Human Rights as a form of punishment that should not be meted out without due process.
1.6.5.1.2. Con: This argument presumes that there is no procedure to challenge the presumption of no re-entry. If there is such a process, that would satisfy the requirements of due process while providing maximum protection from a terrorist re-entering the country.
1.6.5.1.3. Con: Denying re-entry into one country doesn't limit the liberty of an individual in other countries.
1.6.5.1.3.1. Con: However it will likely limit an individual's liberties in any allied countries, since they are likely to back-up and mirror the decision of the person's home country.
1.6.5.1.4. Con: Many states have [exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korematsu_v._United_States) in re-entry laws to allow the government to refuse re-entry to citizens who threaten national security.
1.6.5.2. Pro: Allowing former ISIS fighters a fair trial in a democratic state can protect them from unfair treatment by the legal systems of other nations.
1.6.5.2.1. Pro: The power that captured the foreign national does not necessarily have the capacity to try or imprison the captured fighters, meaning they will not be subject to [due process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process).
1.6.5.2.1.1. Pro: Countries which are active terrorist combat zones are less likely to have secure and stable justice systems.
1.6.5.2.1.2. Pro: In countries such as Syria or northern Iraq the rule of law and the pre-existing legal systems have all but disintegrated.
1.6.5.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.
1.6.5.2.1.3. Pro: Syrian Kurds [do not have the resources](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/13/middleeast/captured-isis-fighters-nobody-wants-intl/index.html) to try and imprison captured ISIS fighters.
1.6.5.3. Pro: Trying returning fighters in their home country provides justice for those at home who may have been hurt by their actions as well as assurance that their crimes won't go unpunished.
1.6.5.3.1. Pro: Diane Foley, the mother of beheaded American journalist James Foley, has [expressed concern](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43601925) that if fighters' home countries don't hold them accountable and take them to trial then the fighters will get off scot-free.
1.6.5.3.2. Pro: Some of the [family members](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-43003248) of ISIS victims have publicly stated that they want captured fighters to face trial for reasons ranging from wanting personal closure to preventing the fighters from hurting others.
1.6.5.4. Pro: Denying returning fighters their civil rights would only serve to reinforce ISIS' claims of victimization by the West.
1.6.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.
1.6.5.5. Pro: The fighters are a risk to any hopes of peace in Syria and Iraq. The country of their origin has a legal and moral obligation to take them back and subject them to the law.
1.6.5.6. Pro: Putting returning ISIS members in prison and not releasing them unless fully rehabilitated acknowledges the brutal nature of ISIS and that the first responsibility of any government is to protect its citizens from harm.
1.6.5.7. Pro: They should be allowed reentry and then promptly be imprisoned, interrogated and punished. Anyone who willingly joined that organization, no matter what role they played are dangerous individuals and must be dealt with accordingly. The victims of the atrocities perpetrated by ISIS deserve justice and we must set examples for those who may be teetering on the verge of Islamic extremism. It would be a grave mistake to turn them away at the border, free to go on and victimize other countries.
1.6.5.8. Con: -> See 1.5.12.
1.6.5.9. Con: A country's legal system is an imperfect tool for obtaining justice if the victims and location of the crime is not on its own territory. It is extremely difficult to gather evidence to the same standard for crimes committed overseas.
1.6.6. Pro: The [territorial principle](https://www.britannica.com/topic/territorial-principle) of international law means that a State has the primary jurisdiction over all events taking place in its territory regardless of the nationality of the person responsible. This clearly suggests that ISIS supporters should be tried and convicted in the countries where they committed their crimes, even if they can't expect a fair trial, since it was their own decision to engage in crimes in the selective parts of the world. In other words: they took the risk.
1.6.7. Pro: Former fighters need to be understood before a trial decision can be made: what uprooted them, what were their motives, did killing people help achieve their aims, what do they want to do next. In order to prevent future fighters, authorities need to understand how they were recruited.
1.6.8. Con: Terrorists should be tried by a UN-led initiative in order to ensure that in instances where it's suspected that the terrorism is state-sponsored, proper investigation is performed and the nation responsible is held accountable.
1.6.8.1. Pro: The best way to ensure that there is a fair and thorough investigative process is to have the trial performed by a third party, as having terrorists tried in either their home county or the country where they operated leaves room for bias and corruption.
1.6.9. Con: -> See 1.6.5.2.1.
1.6.10. Pro: It is the people in the countries where ISIS operates or operated that are most directly affected.
1.6.10.1. Pro: If anybody else committed a crime in a foreign country, we would expect them to be put on trial in that country. ISIS fighters should be no different.
1.6.10.1.1. Con: -> See 1.6.4.2.
1.6.11. Con: This is a different issue to whether or not a blanket ban on re-entry should be issued. It is possible to concede that recruits who can be clearly linked to specific crimes should be tried in the countries where they happened, whilst maintaining that others should be allowed to return home.
1.6.11.1. Con: Membership of ISIS, an illegal terrorist organisation, is necessarily itself a crime and all members should face trial regardless of whether or not they can be linked to specific actions.
1.6.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.
1.7. Pro: People who have committed crimes as part of a terrorist organisation such as ISIS have chosen to forfeit their rights as citizens who enjoy protection by their state of origin.
1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.21.
1.7.2. Pro: All foreign recruits to ISIS were motivated to join the group for reasons which included a [rejection](http://thesoufancenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Beyond-the-Caliphate-Foreign-Fighters-and-the-Threat-of-Returnees-TSC-Report-October-2017.pdf) of the country and society that they left behind. Such a rejection demonstrates that they consciously chose to forfeit their rights and therefore should be stripped of their citizenship.
1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.2.
1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.7.5. Pro: Former ISIS fighters have proven themselves to hate what the Western Civilization stands for, and should not be allowed to enjoy its safety.
1.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.
1.7.7. Con: Human rights are universal. Everyone has the right to return to their country \(article 13\) and has the right to their nationality \(article 15\). [www.un.org](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)  Crimes committed by ISIS are heinous, but the human rights of all people must be protected.
1.7.7.1. Con: Joining ISIS is the same as willingly relinquishing your citizenship since the person willingly became a citizen of a proclaimed foreign country \(The ISIS Caliphate\) and did so knowing that ISIS was at war with all other nations. Thus, their nation is ISIS and no other.
1.7.8. Pro: ISIS fighters should lose their citizenship because they are committing treason.
1.7.8.1. Pro: [Various](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/bills/115/s361) [political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enemy_Expatriation_Act) leaders in the US have proposed that citizens who leave the country and swear allegiance to terror organizations should be officially stripped of their citizenship.
1.7.8.1.1. Con: Such legislation would not be Constitutionally permissible. According to the Supreme Court decision in [Vance v. Terrazas \(1980\)](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/444/252.html), a person must intend to surrender their citizenship, "not just the voluntary commission of an expatriating act such as swearing allegiance to a foreign nation." Merely joining a terrorist organization does not meet this threshhold.
1.7.8.1.2. Pro: Travelling to fight for another country engaged in hostilities against the US is a [constitutionally acceptable](https://people.howstuffworks.com/can-united-states-revoke-citizenship.htm) reason to strip someone of their citizenship.
1.7.8.1.3. Con: Such proposals run the danger of also punishing - and unfairly so - US citizens who go off to fight on the side of US allies.
1.7.8.1.3.1. Pro: There are [US citizens](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/27/world/middleeast/foreign-fighters-kurdish-militia-syria.html) \(and other foreign fighters\) among the ranks of Y.P.G. in Kurdistan. The US has supported Kurdish forces in the conflict against ISIS.
1.7.8.2. Pro: Assuming \(a\) the fighter originates from a Western country, and \(b\) that country has laws prohibiting treason, and \(c\) that country is at war with ISIS, then repatriating ISIS fighters is equivalent to abetting treason. Therefore, ISIS fighters should not be allowed re-entry to that home country.
1.7.8.2.1. Pro: Laws should be created or changed in Western Democracies to allow law makers to consider joining groups such as ISIS to be the equivalent of being the soldier of an enemy state.
1.7.8.2.2. Con: Stripping a person of 5th and 14th Amendment rights with prejudice could also be seen as treasonous.
1.7.8.3. Pro: ISIS' [vehement hatred](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-ramadan-2017-all-out-war-west-new-terror-attacks-manchester-suicide-bombing-islamic-state-a7758121.html) of the West means that signing up to fight for ISIS is participating in a war against their own country, a de facto surrender of citizenship.
1.7.9. Con: Justice to traitors can only be meted out if they remain citizens and are therefore under the jurisdiction of our nation’s justice.
1.7.9.1. Con: The premise that one needs to be a citizen in order to be held accountable implies that it would not be possible to put to trial hostile combatants. History shows, however, that this can be done after a war is over. So why not with ISIS fighters?
1.7.10. Con: There are certain fundamental rights that people should not forfeit even if they do commit crimes. Even convicted serial killers do not lose their nationality and citizenship.
1.7.10.1. Pro: Due process rights [should](https://reason.com/archives/2016/09/22/due-process-terrorism-liberty) extend to terrorists.
1.7.10.2. Con: It's true in general that when people commit crimes they shouldn't lose their basic rights. However, ISIS fighters are guilty of waging war against their home countries, which totally revokes their right to citizenship.
1.7.10.3. Pro: Due to the Western point of view, it is very easy to say that they \(former ISIS fighters\) should not be allowed anything. In the 1940's, there was a similar stigma against the Japanese. They'd attacked the U.S, and Americans took a hard-line stance against them. We, as humans, need to remember that they are lied to, taught an edited version of the Quran that preaches hate. They are still humans, no matter their views.
1.7.10.4. Con: In some western countries they do. In Australia you can be stripped of your residence or citizenship. Over the last two years Australia has expelled about 1000 New Zealanders for being convicted felons. [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/02/deporting-offending-new-zealanders-fair-and-just-turnbull-says). In America you can face the death penalty for treason. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason_laws_in_the_United_States)
1.7.11. Pro: Since the individuals who joined independent forces that fought against ISIS can be punished with [fines or imprisonment](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/33-34/90) once they return home, it's only fair that the people who actually fought for ISIS suffer worse consequences and be denied re-entry entirely.
1.8. Con: By denying ISIS fighters reentry we create problems for countries of their current residence. They might be even worse equipped to handle them, which means a greater danger for all.
1.8.1. Con: Foreign born ISIS fighters do not comprise a significant portion of ISIS forces, meaning their presence is not that significant a factor.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Although statistical evidence is extremely hard to gather, [locals believe](https://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/isil-and-the-numbers-game-what-exactly-is-the-size-of-its-army-1.670132) that foreign fighters comprise a small number of the total force.
1.8.1.2. Con: But if their numbers are so small then the problems for the home countries are also small. The number per home country is a lot smaller compared to the number per country where they are currently residing. So this would only be another argument to bring them back.
1.8.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.21.5.
1.8.1.4. Pro: As of spring 2017, only a [few thousand people](http://time.com/4739488/isis-iraq-syria-tunisia-saudi-arabia-russia/) are reported to have departed to join ISIS from Tunisia, the [top country of origin](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22190) for foreign ISIS fighters.
1.8.1.5. Con: [About 30,000 fighters](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22190.pdf) from at least 85 countries joined ISIS as of December 2015, adding to the strength of ISIS forces.
1.8.2. Pro: Countries where ISIS is currently active already struggle with enforcing law and order, and rising numbers of terrorists within their borders.
1.8.3. Pro: People who participate in unsanctioned foreign conflicts ought to be better managed in their home countries. This way their actions could be assessed, and therefore could be properly managed, detained, or punished by their respective nations therefore diminishing further possible radicalization or potential utilization for future conflicts.
1.8.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.5.2.1.
1.8.3.2. Pro: The country of origin is better suited and likely to be more willing to assess the unique situation of each fighter.
1.8.4. Con: That is not the moral concern of the country denying reentry.
1.9. Con: Denying foreign fighters reentry could put their lives at risk.
1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.7.
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.
1.9.3. Con: Consequences as severe as this for involvement in ISIS are good because they provide a deterrent to prospective recruits.
1.9.4. Con: They put their lives at risk the moment they decided to betray and fight against their own country. Because they decide to do that, they lose the rights on being part of that nation.
1.9.5. Con: The lives of those who have chosen to fight against a country and its citizens should not be placed higher in importance than the lives of the country's citizens itself. Allowing ISIS fighters to return home would put law abiding citizens at risk.
1.9.6. Pro: Barring someone from their home country essentially makes them stateless, which means they have no national ties that will protect their rights.
1.9.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.1.
1.9.6.2. Pro: The notorious ["Beatles" duo](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43601925) has complained that having their citizenship stripped by the UK puts them at risk of rendition and torture.
1.10. Con: Allowing former ISIS fighters re-entry could help to weaken the organisation.
1.10.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.10.2. Pro: Former ISIS members can be used as sources of valuable intelligence and insight into ISIS operations. This information can save lives and help fight ISIS domestically and abroad.
1.10.2.1. Pro: If handled professionally, returning fighters may be convinced to give up secrets about the organisation in exchange for lighter sentencing.
1.10.3. Pro: People who are recruited by terrorist organizations often felt ostracized in their own societies, due to the "us vs. them" mentality of organizations like ISIS. Allowing these individuals to return home would undermine divisive recruitment strategies and be a step forward in reintegration.
1.10.3.1. Pro: Showing love, compassion, and acceptance to returned ISIS fighters will be a more effective method than demonizing them because it reintegrates them into society and breaks down the rhetoric that ISIS uses for recruiting. It also could turn the returned fighters into evangelizers against ISIS, because they witnessed the horrific deeds and the acceptance of the societies they were fighting against. [independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sweden-isis-fighters-city-lund-returning-jihadis-housing-job-education-benefits-reintegration-a7371266.html)[britishcouncil.org](https://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/why-teach-empathy)
1.10.3.1.1. Con: Evidence supports the understanding that once radicalised it is very difficult or even impossible to convert these people back to a moderate viewpoint. [www.hoover.org](https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/futurechallenges_stern.pdf)
1.10.3.2. Con: -> See 1.10.3.1.1.
1.10.4. Pro: Imprisoning returning fighters would weaken ISIS while disincentivising future defectors from leaving in the first place.
1.10.5. Pro: To deny re-entry is to lose a potent weapon against IS - hope for redemption. Repatriated ISIS operatives are sources of human intelligence & legal witnesses for future prosecutors. They won't escape justice either, and many could yet face capital punishment. Electronic monitors, limited travel rights & other restrictions on liberty can be imposed until such time as they've demonstrated signs of rehabilitation.
1.10.6. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
1.10.7. Con: -> See 1.1.15.
1.10.8. Con: -> See 1.4.10.
1.10.9. Pro: Disenchanted ISIS recruits can be used to undermine ISIS propaganda and influence.
1.10.9.1. Pro: EU counterterrorism coordinator [Gilles de Kerchove](https://www.heritage.org/terrorism/commentary/when-isis-fighters-return-home) suggested, “some returnees who don’t have ‘blood on their hands’ are a strong credible voice for counternarrative purposes. They can explain … that they thought they were joining a nice idea of the caliphate but encountered people … being violent.”
1.10.9.2. Con: Using returning fighters as political puppets for anti-ISIS propaganda could endanger their lives by putting a target on their back.
1.10.9.2.1. Pro: Numerous defectors have told authorities that ISIS will [kill anyone](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/09/25/351436894/islamic-state-defector-if-you-turn-against-isis-they-will-kill-you) who turns against them, attempts to leave, or who simply [argues with them](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/isis-kills-anyone-who-argues-with-them-says-defector/).
1.10.9.2.2. Con: Returning fighters choose to leave, aware that there are consequences. The risk of retaliation is very well communicated to their members. For extreme cases a witness protection system could be set up similar to the one for mafia defectors.
1.10.9.3. Pro: Their experience could be publicized and thoroughly discussed in public forums, giving first-hand feedback on the monstrosities and the whole process of conversion and hopefully become the face of movement against extremism.
1.10.9.4. Pro: The ex-head of [MI6](https://www.sis.gov.uk/) believes that ex-ISIS fighters can be [important spokespeople](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/06/richard-barrett-mi6-isis-counter-terrorism) against the group because they can offer a compelling first-hand narrative of the brutality of the group.
1.10.9.5. Pro: If young people \(those who are more malleable to moral judgement\) who joined this criminal organization are taken back to the country under a careful program that rehabilitates them and analyzes their development, they could be the ones that bring a better vision to the vulnerable adolescents of the communities from which they left, and help stop international recruitment.
1.10.10. Pro: The prospect of a return to their home country could act as an incentive for wavering recruits to desert, thus weakening the influence of ISIS.
1.10.11. Pro: We should lead by example. Winning hearts and minds by turning the other cheek - a very powerful message indeed which will not go unnoticed. How starkly different to the side of the fight these terrorists chose to take.
1.10.12. Con: Allowing ISIS members to travel to other countries creates the risk that they will form terrorist networks in other countries.
1.11. Con: By denying ISIS fighters reentry, we set a precedent to allow the government to decide to deny other individuals from reentry, which could have many negative impacts depending on the integrity of the government.
1.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.12.
1.11.2. Con: Specific to ISIS, there are no studies that show this to be true. In fact, quite often terrorists are currently ostracized and prevented from repatriation.
