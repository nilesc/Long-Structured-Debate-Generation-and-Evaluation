Discussion Title: Should education at public universities in the United States be tuition free?

1. Public universities in the United States should be tuition free
1.1. Pro: For a state's provision of a public good to be sustainable in the long term, it is necessary that it benefit everyone. This means that free education must be open to the rich as well as the poor.
1.1.1. Pro: Middle class families are increasingly seeking cheaper alternatives to private education, driving up the cost of tuition \([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/education/learning/community-colleges-middle-class-families.html)\). Free public education is necessary to avoid exclusion of the poor or destitute.
1.1.2. Pro: Improving access to higher education could be a way to fight poverty and enable class mobility within society. If public universities were government subsidized, as they are in many European countries, then all American citizens of all socio-economic backgrounds, not only members of the elite class, would have the opportunity to become educated members of society.
1.1.3. Pro: A public good such as education requires large and constant levels of government spending for it to continue to function properly. It will be in a state of constant competition with other spending priorities. If important groups do not benefit from it, it is likely to lose this battle and hence function sub-optimally with reduced funding.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The rich and middle classes are overwhelmingly more likely to have access to lobbyists and the corridors of power than the working classes. If they do not benefit from free public education, it is extremely unlikely that they would ever lobby in favour of increased funding for it.
1.1.3.2. Pro: The rich and middle classes are more likely to set the agenda for political conversation and discourse through their access to, and control of, media. They are less likely to use these platforms to push for increased sending on education if they do not benefit from it.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Rich and middle class people are a lot more likely to vote than poor people. Politicians are therefore more likely to campaign on the basis of protecting or increasing university education spending if it is something that those groups benefit from.
1.1.4. Con: The rich can still opt out of this free education by attending private universities. Thus if this argument holds true they still have little incentive to maintain this public spending.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Around [1 in 4](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183995/us-college-enrollment-and-projections-in-public-and-private-institutions/) US students attend a private college. Elite colleges are [dominated](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html) by the wealthiest students, and those elite colleges [tend to be](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings-articles/world-university-rankings/us-universities-rankings-public-versus-private) private.
1.1.4.2. Con: As public universities gain a competitive advantage in attracting top students \(no tuition\) they will gain in status such that students of all income levels will want to attend.
1.1.5. Con: Plenty of systems exist which only benefit sections of society, such as welfare or the minimum wage. People are not solely motivated by self-interest: perceptions of justice can drive policy too.
1.1.5.1. Con: Welfare programmes are often under threat from chronic under funding precisely because they are easy for politicians to target and scapegoat without facing electoral backlash.
1.1.5.2. Con: Welfare and minimum wage can benefit people who never actually claim them or rely on them. The knowledge that there is a safety net can substantially change the decisions people make even if they never use it.
1.1.6. Con: Even if the wealthy feel left out from the benefits of public university and correspondingly vote against it under the status quo, the vast majority of the electorate still benefit from public universities and are likely to vote for funding.
1.2. Con: If public universities in the USA are unable to charge tuition fees, they will not have the resources required to attract high quality lecturers or to invest in education facilities.
1.2.1. Pro: [Recently](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/04/13/report-shows-public-higher-educations-reliance-tuition) public universities have seen the proportion of their funding from taxes decrease, making fees even more important.
1.2.2. Con: The Government can simply make up this funding deficit.
1.2.2.1. Con: Control of funding means that politicians can, [and do](http://www.governing.com/news/headlines/how-state-lawmakers-control-state-universities.html), censor courses. These include discussions on homosexuality, and statements on the NRA.
1.2.2.2. Con: The state does not have infinite resources. The state also has many other things which it needs to spend money on. This means that if public universities rely entirely on government funding, the amount of funding they receive will inevitably be limited.
1.2.2.3. Pro: If the U.S. Government can spend trillions of dollars on war then it can easily add a few billion to public education.
1.2.3. Pro: The decreased quality of lecturers and facilities, will result in students having a much worse education experience.
1.2.4. Pro: This will make it harder for public universities to attract the best students. Public universities will not be perceived as 'world class' learning institutions.
1.2.4.1. Con: The goal of a university is to educate people. It is not there to find the best students in the world. It may still try to do this with it's entrance exam but that doesn't change what a university is for.
1.2.5. Con: Public universities, do not need to charge students, or ask for more money from the Government, to meet their running costs.  Instead they should obtain money from sources including but not limited to, private companies, alumni donations and research.
1.2.5.1. Con: This relies on the unwarranted assumption that voluntary donations and research funding will invariably suffice to cover the costs of running a university.
1.2.5.2. Con: Depending on industry or alumni funding has a lot of potential to harm the neutrality of academic research. This is already a huge problem in many academic fields, and increasing that dependence further would make it worse.
1.3. Pro: Students are best served by free public education.
1.3.1. Pro: Students' rights are best served by free public education.
1.3.1.1. Pro: All students would be given the same chances to succeed regardless of how rich their families are.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Since university education is often a prerequisite for accessing the corridors of power, the exclusion of less well off people leads to chronic demographic under-representation in politics and other sectors important for determining the trajectory of society.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Getting a college degree has a remarkable effect on the social mobility. Only 16% of those from the lowest quintile with a college degree remain there whereas  45% of those without a college degree remain in the bottom fifth for income \(Greenstone et al. 2013, [fig. 9](https://www.brookings.edu/research/thirteen-economic-facts-about-social-mobility-and-the-role-of-education/)\).
1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: The wealthy benefit more from University than the poor. For example the earnings after a medical degree for a wealthy \(top 10%\), median, and poor \(bottom 10%\) male student remain roughly the same as the difference between those groups without a medical degree. In the case of female economics graduates the disparity between these three groups actually widens. \(Britton et al. 2016, IFS, [pg. 25-26](https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/wps/wp201606.pdf)\).
1.3.1.1.3. Con: Free university education is not the only way to allow and encourage students from a low income background to attend university.
1.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: A fair student loan system, where repayment is deferred until the student in question has begun their career and is based on ability to pay, would still allow low income students to attend university.
1.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: A [graduate tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_tax) would allow students to attend university and not worry about payment of their fees until they are earning a salary.
1.3.1.1.3.3. Pro: A means-tested fees system could be introduced. This would require wealthy students to still pay for their tuition, but would mean many less well off students would not have to pay anything.
1.3.1.1.4. Pro: University education is increasingly necessary to facilitate success in a world where more and more jobs require university degrees as a minimum for candidates to be even considered.
1.3.1.1.4.1. Pro: Increasingly in the United States Colleges degrees are becoming the [minimum standard](https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/degree-inflation-jobs-that-newly-require-b-a-s/) for work that previously did not require a degree.
1.3.1.1.4.2. Pro: In the past, a high school diploma was enough to get a job at which you could support yourself, and so public interest was supported by free K-12.  Now a college degree is for the most part necessary to adequately support yourself, and if it's going to be a necessity in the economy, it should be within the reach of anyone who is qualified to go.  It's in the best interest of the individuals and the public.
1.3.1.1.5. Con: Attending university, even if fees are covered, still entails considerable costs \(through income forgone to study, living expense, etc.\). Thus targeting the least well off with hardship grants is more effective than simply removing fees.
1.3.1.1.5.1. Con: There is no reason why hardship grants will not coexist with free fees, as they do in many European countries.
1.3.1.1.5.2. Pro: Many community college students who receive full tuition still end up [struggling with severe poverty and homelessness](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-homeless-community-college-20170628-story.html).
1.3.1.2. Con: Around [30%](https://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-Americans-don%E2%80%99t-go-to-college-and-why) of Americans do not attend University. There is no reason why those who do, who predominantly come from [wealthy backgrounds](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/15/college-enrollment-among-low-income-students-still-trails-richer-groups/), have a right to Government spending.
1.3.1.3. Con: Students have a right to an affordable education, but many other options than free university education exist which fulfill that right.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Massive Open Online Courses \(MOOCs\) like [Edx](https://www.edx.org/how-it-works) are free and available to anyone who wants to advance their education at any level of study.
1.3.1.3.1.1. Con: MOOC's suffer from [low completion rates](http://www.g2collective.com/2013/05/01/top-5-issues-with-moocs/).
1.3.1.3.1.2. Con: In most cases these classes do not lead to [degrees or accreditation](http://www.g2collective.com/2013/05/01/top-5-issues-with-moocs/).
1.3.1.3.1.3. Con: MOOCs have chronic issues with [cheating](http://www.g2collective.com/2013/05/01/top-5-issues-with-moocs/).
1.3.1.3.1.4. Con: MOOCs allow for little to [no engagement with professors](http://www.g2collective.com/2013/05/01/top-5-issues-with-moocs/).
1.3.1.3.2. Pro: Students are already offered a free high school education.
1.3.1.3.2.1. Con: A high school degree is no longer a sufficiently high level of education to guarantee employment or get a decent pay.
1.3.1.3.3. Pro: Community colleges are already accessible to students across the economic spectrum.
1.3.1.3.3.1. Con: Community college do not afford you the same contacts and access to corridors of success/power as a larger public university.
1.3.1.3.3.2. Pro: Community college offers a low fee alternative to the high tuitions of other colleges. Even at full cost, community college students pay[on average $3,440 annually](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/pay-for-college/college-costs/college-costs-faqs). Combined with public aid this is affordable on any budget.
1.3.1.3.3.3. Pro: [The majority of the fastest growing occupations in the US, from dental hygienists to veterinary technologists, require only a community college education.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jmaureenhenderson/2012/12/31/forget-four-more-years-why-community-college-could-be-your-ticket-to-financial-success/#4a624ae66530)
1.3.1.3.3.4. Con: Community colleges do not offer the same degree of choice of study as more expensive four year public institutions.
1.3.1.3.3.5. Pro: Under the status quo, students from the poorest fourth of the population [pay no net tuition](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/matt-bruenig-left-case-against-free-college) at either two year or four year public institutions, while also receiving an average of $3,080 and $2,320 respectively to offset some of their annual living expenses. Students from the second poorest fourth also receive on average enough funding to [offset tuition completely](https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/net-price-public-two-year-institutions-dependency-status-income-2011-12) at two year institutions and cover many of their additional expenses. Poor students already have access.
1.3.1.3.3.5.1. Con: Those from poorer backgrounds, because of a lack of knowledge, experience, and information, have a tendency to undervalue tertiary education \([Schleicher, OECD, 2017](http://oecdeducationtoday.blogspot.co.uk/2017/11/is-free-higher-education-fair.html)\). Thus fees could discourage their attendance even if it would be a good investment.
1.3.1.3.3.5.2. Con: While these subsidies and scholarships are helpful, they do not mitigate the loss of opportunities that result from a lack of access to a quality pre-college education.
1.3.1.3.3.5.3. Con: Current tuition levels are not just out of reach for the bottom quarter. Free public University education would benefit those in the middle two quadrants who earn too much to qualify for free education but not enough to afford full tuition.
1.3.1.4. Pro: Under the status quo students who want to attend many public four year colleges end up having to take out loans to finance their education. The high costs of university tuition means that this crushing debt can in many cases hamper their choices significantly moving into their adult lives.
1.3.1.4.1. Con: Given the average college graduate [makes $17,500 more per year than an average high school graduate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/financialfinesse/2016/08/07/why-your-student-loan-debt-may-not-be-as-bad-as-it-seems/#344fafc718b8) and the more expensive \(compared to community college\) 4 year public options [average at $9,970 for in state residents](https://www.collegedata.com/cs/content/content_payarticle_tmpl.jhtml?articleId=10064) with absolutely no scholarships or aid, controlled amounts of debt seem worth it.
1.3.1.4.2. Pro: In the UK students from poorer backgrounds are more likely to drop out, more likely to get lower grades, and less likely to complete their degree within 5 years. These student are left with crippling debt and little opportunity to benefit from their degree \([pg. 16](https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/wps/WP201431.pdf)\)
1.3.1.5. Pro: Students have the right to an affordable education.
1.3.2. Pro: Students will benefit from free public university education.
1.3.3. Con: Paying for tertiary education makes students value it more.
1.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.3.5.1.
1.3.3.2. Con: If students are made to pay for education, students from poorer backgrounds will often have to seek employment to enable them to study. This means that poorer students will have less time to focus on their degrees, and it increases the likelihood that they will not do as well as their peers.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: A study in the UK found that working during term time had a negative effect on degree performance. This effect was particularly pronounced for those who worked for financial necessity \(likely the poorest\) perhaps because they were unable to modify their hours to accomodate important times for course work. \([Jewell S. 2014](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/business-and-economics-journal-2151-6219.1000110.php?aid=31717)\)
1.3.3.3. Pro: Look at how public parks can be dangerous places ... used syringes in children's play areas.  As per Nassib Taleb, skin in the game is everything.  People need to have a financial stake in their education, so that they invest in their education and are accountable for their efforts.  A good way for people to sleep or binge drink through college is to make it free.
1.3.3.4. Con: This extrinsic aspect of value through money only distracts and in practice detracts from the intrinsic value of acquisition of knowledge and understanding, such that people hope to 'make it back once they work'
1.3.3.5. Pro: It has been shown that when parents give more money to their children at university their [performance decreases](https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/01/16/want-your-kids-to-succeed-dont-pay-for-their-education/#42b4002f61d3). A similar effect could be seen if the state provided this increased funding.
1.3.3.6. Con: Even if tertiary education were free it would still have a high value. Attending university prevents students from getting a full-time job, thus foregoing a significant amount of earnings.
1.3.3.7. Pro: Students are more likely to take their studies seriously \(read texts, show up to class, finish degrees, etc.\) if they are paying for their education. This is because not doing so is a waste of money. This leads to more focused educational environments.
1.3.3.7.1. Con: There are far better ways for students to place value on education than high fees. Many countries that provide free education are also highly competitive. Competing for your place in class may be a much better method of motivating students than having them graduating already in debt.
1.3.3.7.2. Con: While this is intuitively true the exact opposite appears to be the case empirically. Higher fee responsibility, probably promoting higher "consumer orientation", actually reduces academic performance \([Bunce et. al. 2016](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03075079.2015.1127908#aHR0cDovL3d3dy50YW5kZm9ubGluZS5jb20vZG9pL3BkZi8xMC4xMDgwLzAzMDc1MDc5LjIwMTUuMTEyNzkwOD9uZWVkQWNjZXNzPXRydWVAQEAw)\)
1.3.3.8. Con: Far from increasing value tertiary education fees cause students from poorer backgrounds to: choose to study different courses; study closer to home; and live at home. [It is argued](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/may/01/higher-tuition-fees-are-distorting-the-choices-poorer-students-make-lower-tuition-fees-could-see-poorer-students-applying-for-different-courses) that these factors, likely resulting in reduced enjoyment, explain the higher rates of incompletion and lower success for poorer students.
1.3.3.8.1. Pro: Lower success and completion rates matter as the reduce the chances of securing a higher paying job, but still leave students with considerable debt, trapping them in a lower economic position.
1.3.4. Con: Students are better served by comprehensive student loan reform and loan forgiveness than free tuition.
1.4. Con: The main beneficiaries of free tertiary education are wealthy students who can already afford the fees. Rather than wasting resources, the US Government should target those most in need.
1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.1.
1.4.2. Con: Most college students use student loans, rather than personal wealth, to pay for college.
1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.4.
1.4.2.2. Pro: [In 2017](https://www.debt.org/students/), 70% of college graduates left school with student loan debt that averaged $38,000.
1.4.3. Pro: Free tuition for all leads to a reduction in access for non-traditional communities.  We see this in Germany, Scotland et al.  We should however have the ability to provide bursaries to those who are within the lowest economic quartile. Governments should consider matching endowments raised by universities.
1.4.4. Pro: College attendance is [disproportionately dominated by the wealthy](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/matt-bruenig-left-case-against-free-college). Free university education in the U.S. provides aid to those who are not in need.
1.4.4.1. Con: Rich families will also have to pay higher taxes in a free university education system.
1.4.4.2. Con: Tertiary education funding could in part be linked to a [graduate tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_tax). This would mean that those paying taxes to this end would have befitted themselves from free education, so it would not be a regressive measure.
1.4.4.3. Con: This is an artifact of the status quo, where the cost of attending college is prohibitive. Tuition free college would eliminate the disproportionate rates of attendance, rather than make it worse.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: While this argument appears intuitively true the empirical evidence from countries that have free tertiary education appears to point in the opposite direction.
1.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: Free tertiary education forces the Government to cap the number of places available to students. As an international comparison Scotland, which has free education, [has far worse](http://www.independent.co.uk/student/into-university/scottish-universities-worst-in-the-uk-for-admitting-poorer-students-despite-having-no-tuition-fees-a7051521.html) access to tertiary education for the poor than the rest of the UK \(which does not have free tuition\).
1.4.4.3.1.1.1. Con: This can be avoided by simply [raising taxes](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2017/08/free-university-cant-hide-scotlands-upstairs-downstairs-education-system) and thus increasing the number of places available.
1.4.4.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The U.S. electorate has historically been very much against tax increases.
1.4.4.3.1.2. Pro: In Germany, with free tertiary education, there are still significant class disparities in college attendance. Three quarters of children with university-educated parents go to university, whereas just [one quarter](https://qz.com/812200/is-free-college-possible-germany-shows-there-are-downsides-to-tuition-free-college/) of those with lower parental education levels attend.
1.4.4.3.1.3. Pro: In Norway, despite free tertiary education, those with parents did not attend university are [as unlikely](http://hechingerreport.org/in-norway-where-college-is-free-children-of-uneducated-parents-still-dont-go/) to go to college as their fee-paying US equivalents.
1.4.5. Con: As we see with primary and secondary education, many wealthy people will still opt to pay extra for what they see as a superior private education.
1.4.6. Con: Making it easier for anyone to go to college \(even the wealthy\) is still a net good towards an educated society.
1.4.6.1. Pro: A population with a larger proportion of highly educated graduates is a [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good) that everybody benefits from.
1.4.6.1.1. Pro: Society is currently facing a number of crises, whether this be the looming threat of climate change or the mass automation of labour and the threat this poses to traditional employment. A society with a deep and diverse pool of highly educated individuals is more likely to find the answers to these questions.
1.4.6.1.2. Pro: If we all benefit from higher education on a society-wide level, it is appropriate that we all pay for it through taxation, rather than imposing the costs on individuals undergoing this education.
1.4.6.1.3. Pro: A UK Government report concluded that graduates are: less likely to commit crime, more likely to volunteer, less likely to have children with educational difficulties, more likely to vote, are more trusting, and are less likely to smoke. All of these characteristics benefit the state as well as the individual. \(BIS Research Paper No. 146, 2013, [pg.15-35](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/254101/bis-13-1268-benefits-of-higher-education-participation-the-quadrants.pdf)\)
1.4.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.4.6.3. Con: This is a question of an opportunity cost. It would be better to put some of the money that could fund free college for all into free college for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The remainder could then fund better secondary schools, or provide more for single parents, or a myriad of other policies to help get poorer students to college.
1.4.7. Con: Many middle and lower middle class families will still benefit tremendously from a free education even if it also helps the wealthy.
1.4.7.1. Con: Increased government benefits to the middle and lower middle class solves this problem at lower cost,  without providing wasteful subsidization to those who do not need it.
1.4.8. Con: Free university education levels the playing field between the different classes of U.S. society, by offering the same level of education.
1.4.9. Pro: Since many families can afford tuition, and others have financial aid, government funds should be used to improve the quality of the education students are getting. [www.crainsnewyork.com](http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20170330/OPINION/170329848/free-tuition-great-but-cuny-needs-money-to-keep-from-falling-apart)
1.4.10. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.3.5.
1.5. Con: Free tertiary education will significantly contribute to degree inflation where more and more entry-level jobs will require degrees thus highschool diploma will be less valuable. U.S. public universities should be affordable instead of free.
1.5.1. Pro: Free university education distorts the market by encouraging too many people to attend university. This worsens degree inflation and causes shortages in non-university jobs.
1.5.1.1. Con: This market distortion and degree inflation is not necessarily caused by free university specifically. In Germany for example, where there is free university education, degree inflation does not occur to the same degree as the US and vocational courses are viewed to be just as prestigious as university degrees and grant access to many of the top jobs.
1.5.2. Con: Careers that are economically sustainable already disproportionately require college degrees. In many cases, jobs that do not require a college degree aren’t as desirable because their wages cannot support the worker, not because of degree inflation.
1.5.3. Con: Degrees do not only exist to garner a competitive advantage in the job market, so degree inflation is a good thing. A more educated population commits less crimes and generates more wealth.[Some relevant data on education vs crime.](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~moretti/lm46.pdf)
1.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.1.3.
1.6. Con: It would be too costly to make public universities free.
1.6.1. Con: The cost of making public universities free would be [not much more](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/heres-exactly-how-much-the-government-would-have-to-spend-to-make-public-college-tuition-free/282803/) than the cost of administering our current loan and aid programs.
1.6.2. Pro: There is no political will to raise taxes, meaning that in many instances, costs will balloon deficits.
1.6.3. Pro: When public colleges become free, there is likely to be a massive increase in enrollment.
1.6.4. Con: Free access to education will result in a more skilled workforce, which will make the economy grow, and increase the amount of tax revenue the state can collect. This will more than offset the cost of the state ensuring Public Universities are free.
1.6.5. Pro: The increased cost in public education would mean a high increase in taxes.
1.6.5.1. Con: Almost every government policy requires an increase in taxation and/or a decrease in spending on other areas. If the policy contributes to the overall public good in a meaningful way, then clearly the trade-off is worthwhile.
1.6.6. Con: Numerous large universities have endowment income of a quantity sufficient that they have no financial need to charge students tuition at all. While they do not have complete control over their endowment spending, it does indicate the possibility that free tuition is economically viable. [Harvard is a high profile example.](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/theres-a-movement-to-end-tuition-at-harvard-2016-2?op=1&r=US&IR=T)
1.6.6.1. Con: As the university that has the largest endowment  in the United States, Harvard is not a representative example for the United States generally. Indeed, there are only [15 universities](https://www.collegeraptor.com/college-rankings/details/EndowmentPerStudent) \(all of them private and most quite small\) whose endowments are even half per student what Harvard's is.
1.6.7. Pro: Doing so would create another fixed expense for the government that would limit future administrations' ability to deal with government spending and debt.
1.6.8. Con: The question does not ask about the expense of providing free University education to all. It asks if it is something that SHOULD be provided. It would benefit our nation so it SHOULD be available. How we pay for it is a separate discussion.
1.6.8.1. Con: To separate the cost from the discussion would warp the discussion. Providing it for everyone if it was free to provide might be great \(like a Coursera degree\) while in person tuition forever many would consider prohibitive \(what most think when they think of University\).
1.6.9. Con: It is [demonstrably untrue](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/080616/6-countries-virtually-free-college-tuition.asp) that free tertiary education is too expensive, as France, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Germany, and Slovenia all have free tertiary education. [All but Norway](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html) have a lower per capita GDP than the US.
1.6.9.1. Con: Even in some of the best case scenarios, like Germany, free tertiary education is financially problematic. This is why the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development \(OECD\) labelled Germany's system ["unsustainable"](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/oecd-germanys-publicly-funded-no-fees-system-unsustainable). High demand for free education has lead to strain on the system making many universities feel [chronically underfunded](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/oecd-germanys-publicly-funded-no-fees-system-unsustainable).
1.7. Con: A university is for people who are academically able. A university is not supposed to be for everyone. A university is more expensive to run the more people enter University.
1.7.1. Con: Excessive attendance at University can be resolved through having effective entrance exams.  Suggesting that a monetary barrier is an effective proxy for academic aptitude is a red herring.
1.7.1.1. Con: With widely available student loans, more difficult entry exams would have the effect of making college attendance more difficult, especially for low income groups who tend to have lower test scores
1.7.2. Pro: In the UK, 50% of people going to University, paying on average £9,000 every year to stay in University. In countries like Germany, where less of its population goes to University, University fees are cheap to non-existing.
1.7.2.1. Con: While Germany does have a lower proportion of students attending university, this is largely because of their much more extensive tiered vocational training \("dual training"\) system - in which apprentices do the equivalent of a college degree in learning hours but pay no tuition regardless \(representing a similar cost\).[Some more background on dual training.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/why-germany-is-so-much-better-at-training-its-workers/381550/)
1.7.2.1.1. Con: Its really hard to compare European and US education systems. Vocational training is really limiting. The US spends far more to educate far more people that in other countries would never have any hope of getting education. The German system especially with their realschule in the 8th grade, applies a kind of cynical realpolitik to individuals. 
The US system creates a more hopeful environment, and is designed to push far more people further than other systems.
1.7.2.2. Con: It is wrong to say that fewer students in Germany go to University. In 2014 Germany had 57% of the current age group going to university: [Students in germany](http://dref.de/en/research/student-numbers-in-germany/)
1.7.2.2.1. Con: Another factual inaccuracy in this statement is the description of the situation in the 'UK'. The UK constituent nations have devolved responsibility for Higher Education. In Scotland, for example, the participation rate in higher education is far higher than that in England and there are no fees at all for EU students at Scottish Universities. Students from elsewhere in the UK pay a fee corresponding to that which would be charged to Scottish students in their country.
1.8. Pro: Access to knowledge should not have a price tag attached to it.
1.8.1. Con: With libraries becoming interconnected and ever expanding multi-lingual massive open online courses \(MOOC\) available,  knowledge has never been "free-er" than it already is today.
1.8.2. Con: Nothing in life is free, and educational facilities are no exception. If not paid for directly, it would be paid for indirectly through higher taxes.
1.8.3. Pro: Knowledge is freely available in libraries and on the internet. Education is a different matter it requires someone to assist a student in learning how to think and understand the knowledge
1.8.4. Con: Access to knowledge does not have a price tag.   The internet and libraries are FILLED with mountains of knowledge.   Getting someone to monitor a person for 4 years and thereby certify that they have a level of knowledge -- THAT has a price tag.
1.8.4.1. Con: The opportunity to ask questions to experts \(as is supposed to be facilitated in a proper education\) is a very valuable and often neccessary source of knowledge
1.8.4.2. Con: Thinking of education as simply access to sources of knowledge/internet is somewhat analogous to giving your toddler a ton of books without being allowed to tell him how to read.
1.8.5. Pro: Knowledge is power. By putting a price on education, you favour rich people over poor people. This strengthens plutocracy \(=power to the rich\) and weakens democracy \(=power to the people\).
1.9. Pro: The cost of tuition has gone up by a far greater margin than naturally occurring inflation would suggest. In fact, many of the things universities need to function have seen a decrease in production cost. Comparing a few decades ago to now, college has become a luxury  commodity with a price tag to match. [Inflation 1996-2016](https://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zerohedge.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2Fuser230519%2Fimageroot%2F2016%2F08%2F18%2FCollege%2520Inflation.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zerohedge.com%2Fnews%2F2016-08-18%2Fsimple-chart-illustrates-absurdity-college-inflation&docid=dKP4UaKTNJwb_M&tbnid=kL2UqfLdlOljIM%3A&vet=1&w=850&h=1208&hl=en-us&source=sh%2Fx%2Fim)
1.9.1. Con: One reason the cost of a university education has risen faster than inflation is because there is demand from the labor market for such an education. Just because the cost has  risen faster than inflation, alone, does not justify making a good/service free.
1.10. Pro: Free education could make grading less corrupt because students no longer feel they are entitled to a diploma since they are purchasing it.
1.11. Con: The first thirteen years of free public education are the most important investment \(K - 12\). This is where the bulk of government subsidy should go.
1.12. Pro: Free public education is a good economic public investment.
1.12.1. Pro: Fewer Americans would need to seek other forms of public assistance.
1.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.1.
1.12.3. Con: Tertiary education is also a very good personal investment, and as such students should bear some portion of the cost of education through fees, as they will later reap personal benefits \(BIS Research paper no. 146, 2013, [pg. 45 onwards](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/254101/bis-13-1268-benefits-of-higher-education-participation-the-quadrants.pdf)\).
1.12.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.3.5.1.
1.12.4. Pro: Free education removes barriers to access for minorities and individuals of low socio-economic class.
1.12.4.1. Con: The poorest students often obtain [free](https://www.collegexpress.com/interests/public-colleges-and-universities/articles/financial-aid-public-colleges/financial-aid-public-colleges-and-universities-funding-your-future/) university educations, because there are forms of financial aid which cover their tuition fees.
1.12.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.12.5. Pro: An educated populace benefits the entire population. It’s tax money well spent.
1.12.5.1. Con: This would assume all pursued degrees share equal value, which is demonstrably false from an economic standpoint. Education does not equal economic value, which is why many individuals have trouble paying back loans. A better application of tax money would be paying down the national debt or investing in critical infrastructure necessities.
1.12.5.2. Pro: Companies and society suffer when employees hate their jobs, free education makes a career switch easier and more affordable.
1.12.5.3. Pro: Knowledge is the single greatest asset that any person can attain, and this extends to the strength of a nation. A well educated citizenry is far more beneficial to a nation than any military force. Education should be free at all levels throughout a person's lifetime.
1.12.6. Pro: Free university education would mean more high skilled workers in the economy and higher tax revenues.
1.12.6.1. Pro: The low skilled blue collar jobs of the 20th century are [declining](http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/the-decline-of-blue-collar-jobs-in-graphs) rapidly due to rising automation and low cost foreign labor. High skilled workers are needed in our modern economy.
1.12.6.1.1. Pro: [Automation](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/11/30/567408644/automation-could-displace-800-million-workers-worldwide-by-2030-study-says) could displace 800,000,000 workers worldwide by 2030.
1.12.6.2. Con: Trade schools and community colleges already can provide you with the skills to compete in a modern economy.
1.12.7. Pro: University admission would become more competitive and those who have a higher likelihood of completing a degree and using it would be benefiting from it. This would reduce the volume of people who are dropping out of college, gaining no degree yet still acquiring debt.
1.12.7.1. Con: Making college easier to attend, by reducing monetary cost would likely increase attendance among people least likely to graduate- increasing drop out rates
1.12.8. Pro: Saddling students with massive student debt limits their consumer spending potential that could stimulate the economy.
1.12.8.1. Con: Paying back loans does not reduce output, as financiers of student loans can spend or invest the repayments. Debt has little impact on aggregates.
1.12.9. Pro: With AI becoming a reality, those without higher education will start to become unemployable and disenfranchised.
1.12.10. Pro: If education were tuition free, barriers to access due to economic factors would be greatly diminished. This would lead to a more educated citizenry, and that would benefit all of society. The electorate in a democracy would be more likely to elect better leaders, because of a better understanding of all issues. This in turn would create a stronger more responsive government, and deeper satisfaction with said government among the electorate.
1.12.11. Pro: Countries with tuition-free college tend to be very economically stable and prosperous.
1.12.12. Pro: [Studies](https://www.luminafoundation.org/files/resources/its-not-just-the-money.pdf) have shown that post-secondary education corresponds with increased levels of happiness.
1.12.13. Con: A government should only subsidize programs that objectively and cost-effectively improve quality of life for society as a whole. Higher education should be subsidized on a case-by-case basis, considering a student's academic performance, the societal and financial merit of their chosen qualification, and the country's changing requirements for certain specialist professionals. To simply subsidize all of higher education would be wasteful and inefficient.
1.12.14. Pro: Reducing barriers to education will allow those who have potential to realize it and thereby make their country better in the process. From a Country's strategic advantage perspective, any that offer free university will gain over those that don't simply because there is the widest possible access. Studies suggest that higher brain functions are released and expressed when people don't have to worry about bills and how to pay them.
1.12.15. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.13. Pro: Free college would make universities more competitive to gain admissions, resulting in a steady improvement of the University. In the State of Florida, after the Bright Futures System was implemented \(free/partially paid for college to those who meet certain standards\) the State universities saw a significant improvement in their National Rankings and a decrease in their admissions rates. For example, the University of Florida is now one of the top 10 public universities after bright futures.
1.14. Con: Public universities should not be tuition free.  Not if the funding comes from the government.  Government should tax only to provide for national defense, criminal law enforcement and other functions directly related to the prohibition of initiating force, fraud or theft.  It is immoral to make others pay for one's education.  A free marketplace will provide an education more efficiently than a government education paid for by unwilling taxpayers.
1.14.1. Con: There are actually three cases for government intervention in markets. In the case of \(natural\) monopoly, information assymetry and the presence of externalities. Education has at least an information assymetry \(value of education is uncertain for buyer\) and as a public good has an external benefit, meaning that under the free market there might be too little or malinvestment. Many of the big universities may also have significant monopoly power.
1.14.2. Con: Even if you ever were to reach a perfect society, you would have to educate all civilians in that society in order to maintain it. The road there makes that argument even more true.
1.14.3. Con: If the government didn't pay for ANY education it would result in a large portion of population, especially the poor, to be uneducated. With the poorest not even having an elementary education.
1.14.4. Con: Close to 50% of [the government's discretionary spending](https://www.thebalance.com/current-us-discretionary-federal-budget-and-spending-3306308) does not go to the prohibition of force or the military.
1.15. Pro: The US will be at a competitive disadvantage without free public universities. The pay-wall on American education allows other countries to have a much more competitive knowledge based economy when those other countries do not have such a strong economical selection on education.
1.15.1. Pro: Free taxpayer-funded STEM education is required to put the US on a competitive footing with China.
1.15.1.1. Pro: The PRC ensures that its brightest & most competent students are taught, trained, and focused on the domains where China deems it most important to compete with the US, EU, and Asean.
1.15.1.2. Pro: Absent free taxpayer-funded STEM education, the US will decline in significance, weighed down by debt, desperately sabre-rattling to seem important... while innovation happens elsewhere. \(c.f. UK in the 1970s\)
1.15.2. Con: The US academic system is supported by a combination of both public and private universities that consistently rank among the best in the world. Free public universities would not necessarily increase the quality of the knowledge being produced at the universities.
1.16. Pro: In many developed [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_France#Tuition_costs) [countries](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/why-germany-educates-international-students-for-free), public universities are virtually tuition free. This proved to be beneficial in many ways there, and may do so in US.
1.16.1. Pro: USSR was able to compete with USA in The Cold War and The Space Race in particular because the higher education was [tuition free](http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12568.html): it allowed for a rash increase of number of engineers.
1.16.2. Pro: Free tuition [increased](http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180524141640103) Germany's overall popularity as a country.
1.16.3. Con: European countries are also weighed down heavily with taxes for all of the other things they get for free as well.
1.17. Con: It is already possible for even poor students who are academically able to attend universities very affordably. Thus, there is no reason for public universities to be tuition free.
1.17.1. Pro: In many ways, college is already free to those who are motivated and disciplined. For example, in the State of Florida, tuition and books are paid for under the Bright Futures / Florida Academic Scholars Award. You are guaranteed this award if you have a 1300 on the SAT, a 3.5 weighted GPA, and earn 100 service hours over four years of high school. This program ensures students who are truly college bound are afforded this opportunity over those who may not succeed in college.
1.17.2. Pro: In the US, between grants and scholarships, university education can be zero financial cost if a student is able to achieve enough academically while working part time to pay living expenses \(at an instate university\). I am living proof of that, it can be done. From what i have noticed, if a student doesn't have to work to earn their education, they will not likely take it as seriously.
1.17.2.1. Con: Most students have to take loans to pay for their college tuition. [Student debt](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/student/portfolio) has continued to increase until today were it's worth 1.4 trillion dollars.
1.18. Con: Free tertiary education is bad for access and social mobility.
1.18.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.
1.18.2. Pro: When those who can afford to pay tuition fees are made to do so, universities have more money available to fund scholarships and bursaries for the less well off.
1.18.3. Con: If public universities are not free, many students will have to take out loans to afford to attend. Working class students are much more likely to be avoid applying to university, because of a fear of getting into [debt](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40112033).
1.18.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.1.1.
1.18.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.
1.18.6. Con: In the US public universities have been reducing their support, and [thus reducing access](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/10/26/top-public-universities-are-shutting-out-poor-students-report-says/?utm_term=.b6e9effd4f84), for poorer students. This is because it is cheaper, and better for their rankings, to attract wealthy students with part-subsidies than poorer students with full subsidies. Thus the fees are locking people out of education.
1.18.7. Con: Studies in the US over a number of years have found that increases in tuition fees are correlated with lower rates of attendance, particularly amongst disadvantaged groups \(Dearden et al., [pg. 6](https://www.ifs.org.uk/wps/wp1117.pdf)\)
1.19. Con: Making public universities free would make it too difficult for private universities to compete.
1.19.1. Con: Private universities tend to be more specialized than public universities. As a result, the costs associated with attendance will be mitigated to some degree by public interest in specialized programs.
1.19.2. Con: It is extremely unclear what unique benefit private universities bring. In Europe, the vast majority of the top universities are public, with private universities generally having a bad reputation.
1.19.3. Con: Making public universities free would provide incentive for private universities and colleges to decrease their bloated tuition costs.
1.19.3.1. Con: No matter how low they bring down their fees it will be very hard for private entities to compete with free tuition.
1.19.3.2. Con: Just like other firms in the private sector, the overall [rise](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/magazine/is-college-tuition-too-high.html) in real estate cost over the past decades have made running a university much more expensive.
1.19.3.3. Con: The "bloated" tuition fees of private universities are [disproportionately targeted at wealthy students in order to subsidize a more socio-economically diverse student body.](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/magazine/is-college-tuition-too-high.html)
1.19.4. Pro: Private universities have historically been institutions of innovation in education, forcing them into an unfair marketplace would be a mistake.
1.19.4.1. Con: Prestigious and well funded private universities will still be able to stay open, leaving room for plenty of private innovation in education.
1.19.4.2. Pro: Private universities raise the bar for quality of education \(student/faculty ratio, quality of student life, career development, etc.\) by making public universities have to compete with them for students.
1.19.4.3. Con: Plenty of innovation in education comes from public universities, they make up many of the examples of innovation cited [in this report](https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/septoct-2015/americas-ten-most-innovative-college-presidents/).
1.19.4.4. Pro: Public universities are controlled by the state making politically controversial courses of study more difficult.
1.19.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.19.4.5. Pro: Private universities are more willing and able to take risks on new specialized programs, because of their flexibility in funding.
1.19.4.5.1. Pro: Investing in new areas of study is essential for the development of every academic discipline.
1.19.4.5.1.1. Con: Public funding also supplies grants for new and innovative programs.
1.19.5. Con: Private universities [exist](https://europe.graduateshotline.com/germany/cheap-private-universities.html) in countries such as Germany which have [free public universities](https://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/student-finance/how-much-does-it-cost-study-germany). Free fees simply raise the bar for the quality of education the private schools must offer. This is analogous to the co-existence of free public, and fee paying private, schools.
1.19.6. Pro: The last thing education needs is a homogenizing force, i.e. a "single payer" for all university education in the US.
1.19.6.1. Con: The U.S. already has a robust public university system that serves a diverse student body. There is no reason to think that modifications to the tuition mechanism would change this substantially.
1.19.7. Pro: Given that many churches sponsor faith-based universities, free public universities can be regarded as discriminatory against religions.
1.19.7.1. Con: This would be true only if the state was also banning private universities. The state has no obligation to ensure the optimal environment for an organisation to make a profit if that comes at the expense of the general public good, even if that organisation is affiliated with a religion.
1.19.7.1.1. Pro: The situation at the university level is analogous to the high school level. The fact that there is a free public school system is not discriminatory against parochial education.
1.19.8. Pro: Private universities would be forced to cater to wealthy students in order to stay open making them even more of a socioeconomic bubble.
1.20. Pro: Previous generations made a commitment to public education that our generation should honor.
1.20.1. Con: While tertiary education has been valued there's no particular evidence that previous generations thought it should be free. The United States has [never had](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/feb/09/bernie-s/was-college-once-free-united-states-and-it-oversea/) nationwide free tertiary education, and there are records of colleges charging fees stretching back at least 100 years.
1.20.2. Con: In a democracy, the policy preferences of the current electorate should take precedence over decisions from previous generations.
1.20.3. Pro: Founding fathers of the United States, like [Thomas Jefferson](https://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/educated-citizenry-vital-requisite-our-survival-free-people-spurious-quotation), believed that a highly educated citizenry was essential for the U.S. to succeed as a free and democratic society.
1.20.3.1. Con: While Jefferson is likely correct about the importance of an educated citizenry, his belief falls short of being a meaningful commitment as there were no policies attached to it.
1.20.3.1.1. Con: In fact, Jefferson did propose and implement significant [reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_and_education#Plan_for_systematic_education) in the State of Virginia that went well beyond simply calling for an educated citizenry. These efforts can be considered a substantial commitment.
1.20.3.2. Pro: An informed electorate through increased rates of higher education leads to better political decisions.
1.20.3.2.1. Con: High schools seem the better place to focus on educating the electorate.
1.20.3.2.1.1. Pro: High school civics classes seem a far more logical place, with wider reach, for the education of an electorate.
1.20.3.2.1.2. Pro: High schools educate students before they turn 18 and are able to vote.
1.20.3.2.1.3. Con: Universities can offer deeper, more mature, discussion on social issues relevant to voting.
1.20.3.2.2. Con: Many university fields of study have nothing to do with engaging in an electorate.
1.20.3.2.3. Pro: The [vast majority](https://www.goacta.org/images/download/what_will_they_learn_2010-11.pdf) of higher education institution have core curriculums of some kind that lead to a more complex engagement with social issues.
1.20.4. Con: It is unclear why what was right for previous generations is right for us today. Times have changed.
