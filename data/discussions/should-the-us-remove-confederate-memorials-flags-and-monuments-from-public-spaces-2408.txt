Discussion Title: Should the US remove Confederate memorials, flags, and monuments from public spaces?

1. The US should remove Confederate memorials, flags, and monuments from public spaces.
1.1. Con: Removing or renaming Confederate memorials/monuments presents a slippery slope wherein eventually any memorial linked to the colonial era or other problematic legacies could be considered representative of oppression, and thus deserving of eradication.
1.1.1. Con: [The slippery slope is only a valid argument if you can prove the slope is real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope), meaning that you can prove that the beginning action being argued for includes significant provisions or risks that will lead to continuing the process.
1.1.1.1. Con: The existence of the slope can be proven by looking at similar efforts that are now proliferating \(efforts to remove Canada's first PM's name from a school, or efforts to remove the statue of the mayor of Halifax\). The difficulties of a slippery slope are not necessarily a reason to preserve Confederate monuments, but the argument of a slippery slope cannot be rebuffed by saying it does not exist.
1.1.1.2. Con: If the phrase slippery slope is an obstacle, than refer to it as dangerous implications. The same truth applies. A slope does not need to exist for an implication to be very real, a precedent to be set. The argument is retrospective. One can only prove the implications or precedents were negative after additional negative things have happened. Careful consideration of such potential is absolutely imperative.
1.1.2. Con: The claim assumes erasing the history of slavery could be accomplished solely by taking down public monuments. The slippery slope would necessarily include the banning of history books, documentaries, oral traditions, etc., which is highly improbable.
1.1.2.1. Con: Banning or editing [history books](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/07/13/421744763/how-textbooks-can-teach-different-versions-of-history), [popular books](http://www.bannedbooksweek.org/censorship/bannedbooksthatshapedamerica), and [oral traditions](http://www.philly.com/philly/opinion/commentary/20170419_College_students_rejecting_freedom_of_speech.html) have happened and are already happening.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: That "[slippery slope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope)" predictions have come true in the past does not make any slippery slope argument inherently non-fallacious. A slippery slope argument is considered fallacious when a chain of events based on acceptance of some principle for action is not given additional evidence which suggests its likelihood beyond the mere fact of the acceptance of said principle.
1.1.3. Con: We would remember Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and other slave-owning founders even if they had not owned slaves. Their contributions transcend the stain of slavery.  Confederate heroes, in contrast, are only remembered for defending slavery.  Whatever other qualities they may have possessed would not have resulted in monuments bearing their likenesses.
1.1.3.1. Con: People are already talking about removing the George Washington and Thomas Jefferson monuments as part of the same purge as the Confederate era monuments.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: People are talking about removing George Washington statues and public references.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: University of Texas had a student [petition](https://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2015/06/29/university-of-texas-students-petition-to-remove-statue-of-george-washington/) about removing George Washington monument.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Unless a majority or significant number of people are talking about this and want it to happen, it has no merit. If we listened to the extremes of every single issue and considered them as legitimate claims, then we would never be able to debate anything.
1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Chicago [Pastor](https://www.discussionist.com/1016239287) calls on Rahm Emanuel to remove George Washington Monument.
1.1.3.1.1.3. Pro: Some Washington DC [residents](https://pjmedia.com/blog/video-d-c-residents-say-take-down-jefferson-memorial-rename-washington-d-c/) want to take down Jefferson Monument and rename city.
1.1.3.1.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: People are talking about removing Thomas Jefferson statues and public references.
1.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Civil rights activist and minister Al Sharpton has called for the [removal](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/08/17/al_sharpton_defund_the_jefferson_memorial_asking_me_to_subsidize_the_insult_of_my_family.html) of Thomas Jefferson monument.
1.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.3.
1.1.3.1.2.3. Pro: [Jefferson Memorial](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-thomas-jefferson-confederate-statues-20150624-story.html) entered the national debate when a CNN anchor questioned of the memorial should be taken down.
1.1.3.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.1.3. Con: Those arguments should be taken on their own merits; that they are being made at all has no clear logical bearing on the discussion at hand. This is the central reason why we judge slippery slope arguments to be fallacious.
1.1.3.1.4. Con: It is fine to honor them despite their horrid mistake. Washington and Jefferson represent far more than this simple fact. Owning slaves in that time, while despicable and unforgivable, was still the norm. Confederates cannot be compared as they fought a war to end their own country  to preserve slavery. Washington and Jefferson merely participated in it.
1.1.3.1.4.1. Con: If the decision to remove, or keep in place, a statute depends upon which people were criminal Slave Traders and which were not, then George Washington monuments are by far and away the worst offenders. It was George Washington and the Federalist Party \(which was not federal\) responsible for making Slavery "Legal" in 1789, which doomed millions of innocent African lives.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1. Con: George Washington was not a Federalist \(Alexander Hamilton\) or an Anti-Federalist \(Thomas Jefferson\). He despised parties. "They serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put, in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party." [avalon.law.yale.edu](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp)
1.1.3.1.5. Con: There are going to be people on the fringe in every situation. This is not about every historical slave owner. This is about people whose primary connotation involves slavery and racism. We cannot separate slavery from these individuals and have them still be important. Others like Washington and Jefferson are known for their achievements in the founding of the country, slavery is a not their main association.
1.1.3.2. Con: The Confederacy was about far more than slavery: it was also about states' rights, economic grievances, and issues of military protection. Ignoring these reasons for secession paints an inaccurate picture of history.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: In the ["Declarations of Causes"](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/reasons-secession) issued by Texas, Mississippi, Georgia, and South Carolina, the defense of slavery is presented as a foremost cause for secession.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: The [Confederate states cited abuses by the Federal Government first](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/ordinances_secession.asp) in most cases in their Declarations of Secession.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: In [South Carolina's Declaration of Secession](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/southcarolina_declaration.asp), the first sentence reads- "frequent violations of the Constitution of the United States, by the Federal Government, and its encroachments upon the reserved rights of the States."
1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The Declaration claims right after that secession is justified "in deference to the opinions and wishes of the other slaveholding States".
1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: According to the [Declaration](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/southcarolina_declaration.asp), the General Government has "ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution" due to  "increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery".
1.1.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: The [Alabama Declaration of Secession](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/ordinances_secession.asp) opens with- "Whereas, the election of Abraham Lincoln… avowedly hostile to the domestic institutions and to the peace and security of the people of the State of Alabama, preceded by many and dangerous infractions of the constitution of the United States by many of the States and people of the Northern section…as to justify the people of the State of Alabama in the adoption of prompt and decided measures for their future peace and security."
1.1.3.2.1.1.2.1. Con: The Alabama Declaration of Secession brings up the election of Abraham Lincoln because he ran on a platform opposed to the expansion of slavery, and the "domestic institutions" the Union is being hostile to is slavery. All roads in the Confederate arguments for secession eventually lead back to the fear they felt toward their "peace and security" being ruined by the abolition of slavery.
1.1.3.2.1.1.3. Pro: In [Texas' Declaration of Secession](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/texas_declaration.asp), this is in the third paragraph, "Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people."
1.1.3.2.1.1.3.1. Con: After that, it reads: \[Texas\] was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro [slavery](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/texas_declaration.asp) - the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits - a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time
1.1.3.2.1.1.4. Pro: In [Georgia's Declaration of Secession](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/georgia_declaration.asp), the first paragraph states: "They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property, and by the use of their power in the Federal Government have striven to deprive us of an equal enjoyment of the common Territories of the Republic."
1.1.3.2.1.1.4.1. Con: This is the [preceding sentence](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/georgia_declaration.asp) to the one above: "For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery." The 'property' alluded to in the next sentence was people, black people. Therefore to argue that the war was not about slavery but about 'abuses' by the federal government is false: the "abuse" was anti-slavery policy.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5. Con: In the [Mississippi Declaration of Secession](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/mississippi_declaration.asp), it opens with a defense of slavery.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1. Con: Usually the argument is not that the civil war was not about slavery, but only that slavery was not the primary [factor](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/states-rights), only secondary. While the civil war was about slavery, it was first and foremost about if state laws took precedence over federal laws. Slavery was of course one of the main laws being considered in this regard.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Lincoln [announced in his inaugural address](http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres31.html) and at the [initiation of hostilities that the war was about the preservation of the Union](http://www.abraham-lincoln-history.org/civil-war-militia/), not freeing slaves.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: The cause of the dissolution of the union by the confederate factions was over the issue of slavery. Although Lincoln's rationale was to preserve the union, the rationale was pre-empted by the primary cause for secession: Slavery. This being clearly articulated in all of the Confederate Secession Congress meetings.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: "I appeal to all loyal citizens to favor, facilitate and aid this effort to maintain the honor, the integrity, and the existence of our National Union, and the perpetuity of popular government" –[Abraham Lincoln, Proclamation Calling Militia and Convening Congress, April 1861](http://www.abraham-lincoln-history.org/civil-war-militia/)
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.1.3. Pro: "My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union." – [Abraham Lincoln, August 1862](http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm)
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.1.4. Pro: "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so." – [Abraham Lincoln Presidential Inaugural Address, March 1861](http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres31.html)
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.1.5. Con: The motivation of The Union is not relevant to that of the Confederate.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: The Civil War was not about slavery until Lincoln used the [Emancipation Order](https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/emancipation-proclamation) to rally support from the Union and weaken the Confederacy in the third year of fighting in January 1863.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: [Lincoln refused to accept that he could free the slaves in the "states in rebellion" as late as Fall of 1862.](http://Donald, David. Lincoln, page 365 \(Simon and Schuster 1996\))
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.1.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.3. Pro: Lincoln supported a [proposed constitutional amendment](http://cognoscenti.legacy.wbur.org/2013/02/18/the-other-13th-richard-albert) that would have made it permanently impossible for the federal government to abolish slavery. Staying in the Union was a far less risky way to maintain slavery.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.3.1. Con: Whatever other amendments Lincoln considered, the [amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) that he actually worked to pass ended slavery. This fact is far more relevant than other considerations he'd considered.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.1.3.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.3.1.2. Con: Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation under the war powers act. It was considered a military action.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: [Lincoln saw the slave labor force as a back bone to the southern economy which was fueling the Confederate war effort.](http://www.civilwarhome.com/lincolnabolitionist.html)
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.4. Pro: It was commonly believed in both the [North](http://www.civilwarhome.com/lincolnabolitionist.html) and the [South](http://www.ushistory.org/us/27f.asp) that rapidly freeing slaves would collapse the South's economy.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.3.1.2.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.3.1.2.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6. Con: "Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth." --[Alexander H. Stevens](http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/cornerstone-speech/), Vice President of The Confederacy, Mar 21, 1861.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1. Con: Racism and white superiority was common in the 19th century, including [science](http://reducetheburden.org/scientific-racism/), [religion](http://www.christianpost.com/news/john-brown-us-slavery-and-segregated-churches-a-christian-historian-offers-perspective-115033/), and [intellectuals](https://kenanmalik.wordpress.com/2013/02/13/on-the-enlightenments-race-problem/), and was prevalent around the world, [including both Union and Confederate states.](https://www.ravenfoundation.org/racism-in-the-civil-war-north/)
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1. Pro: The South did not have a monopoly on racism. Abraham Lincoln would be considered a white supremacist and a white nationalist by today's standards.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.1. Pro: “I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races: that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people… And while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.” –[Abraham Lincoln](http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/the-lincoln-douglas-debates-4th-debate-part-i/)
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.1.1. Con: In this same [speech](http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/the-lincoln-douglas-debates-4th-debate-part-i/), Lincoln said "I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied every thing \[...\] So it seems to me quite possible for us to get along without making either slaves or wives of negroes." So although he may have been racist, Lincoln did not support slavery.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.1.3.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.1.4.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.1.2. Con: This speech is from 1858. Lincoln's views evolved during the [Civil War](http://www.npr.org/2010/10/11/130489804/lincolns-evolving-thoughts-on-slavery-and-freedom). It is thus incorrect to make a blanket inference about his views, and the meaning of the Civil War in particular, from this speech.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.1.2.1. Con: [The fourth Lincoln-Douglas Debate](http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/the-lincoln-douglas-debates-4th-debate-part-i/) was conducted in public leading up the presidential election that ultimately sparked the Civil War. The statements he made in the debate are also reflected in statements that Lincoln made after he was elected as president.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.1.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.1.3.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.2. Pro: [Had Lincoln survived after the war, there were plans to send all previous slaves to Central America.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8319858/Abraham-Lincoln-wanted-to-deport-slaves-to-new-colonies.html) It would be consistent to destroy monuments to Lincoln as racist and white supremacist.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.1.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.2.2. Con: The cited [article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8319858/Abraham-Lincoln-wanted-to-deport-slaves-to-new-colonies.html) itself notes that "the colonisation plan had collapsed by 1864", well before Lincoln's death.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Just because the colonization plan had collapsed before Lincolns death doesn't absolve him from his support for the plan.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Pointing out that the plan had been abandoned before Lincoln's death demonstrates that it is is false to claim "had Lincoln survived the war, the plans  were to send all previous slaves to Central America."
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Lincoln's plans were to send slaves to Central America. Just because this one initiative failed doesn't mean he wouldn't have tried again.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.3.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4. Con: It is not necessary for the South to have a monopoly on hate for it to now serve as a rallying point for present day white supremacists.  The simple fact is that Lincoln is not currently used as a rallying symbol for white supremacists, while the Confederacy is.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1. Con: The [over 1,500 Confederate monuments](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/whoseheritage_splc.pdf) are not uniform in presentation and content, and are not widely used as a white supremacist rallying points.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: [There are only between five and eight thousand KKK members](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan), compared to the United States population of over 323 million people. This makes the KKK, at most, only 0.00002 percent of the population.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: “Since the era of formal [white supremacy](http://abcnews.go.com/US/state-white-supremacy-neo-nazi-groups-us/story?id=49205764) -- right before the Civil Rights Act when we ended \[legal\] segregation -- since that time, this is the most enlivened that we've seen the white supremacist movement,” said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center \(SPLC\), a legal advocacy organization that monitors such extremist groups.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: "The SPLC breaks down the groups by category, noting that there were 99 neo-Nazi groups, 130 outposts of the [Ku Klux Klan](http://abcnews.go.com/US/state-white-supremacy-neo-nazi-groups-us/story?id=49205764), 43 neo-Confederate groups, 78 racist skinhead groups and 100 white nationalist groups. Various other groups – those classified as anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, Christian identity or general hate groups – could also share some ideology with white supremacist or white nationalist groups."
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: White supremacists are a small fraction of the populace, and yet we are arguing for decisions with permanent effects that impact much of the populace.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Most of those in the alt-right are not white supremacists.](http://www.npr.org/2017/08/15/543730227/unite-the-right-charlottesville-rally-represented-collection-of-alt-right-groups)
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: According to the [Associated Press](https://blog.ap.org/behind-the-news/how-to-describe-extremists-who-rallied-in-charlottesville), alt-right is a political grouping mixing racism, white nationalism, anti-Semitism and populism.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: A study established a [psychological profile](https://psyarxiv.com/c9uvw/) of self identified alt-right individuals and found that they exhibited extreme levels of overt intergroup bias, including the blatant dehumanization of racial minorities.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The amount of white people who are racist is surprisingly high. It follows that much more hold white supremacist views but may not display it publicly. 55% of white people in America believe that whites are actually the ones being [discriminated](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/24/559604836/majority-of-white-americans-think-theyre-discriminated-against) against.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.2. Con: SPLC information about white supremacist and white nationalist groups gives us no idea how many people are members, or whether any are of significant size.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.

1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.2. Con: The quoted article undermines this claim when it explains the two key times in history when these monuments were built and dedicated. "The first began around 1900, amid the period in which states were enacting Jim Crow laws to disenfranchise the newly freed African Americans and re-segregate society. This spike lasted well into the 1920s, a period that saw a dramatic resurgence of the [Ku Klux Klan](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/whoseheritage_splc.pdf), which had been born in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War."
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: "...The [second spike](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/whoseheritage_splc.pdf) began in the early 1950s and
lasted through the 1960s, as the civil rights movement
led to a backlash among segregationists."
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.2.2. Con: Immediately following the Civil War in the Recontruction Era, most locals did not even have any say over their own government or what monuments should or could be placed. Many of the monuments were constructed after the military governors who were appointed, not elected, left.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.2.2.1. Con: The Reconstruction era was the first time in the south when a majority of males were able to vote for their governments.  The defeat of reconstruction was brought about through terrorism and it is that defeat of democracy that these statutes celebrate.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.2.3. Con: [Resources were very constrained in former Confederate states in the years immediately following the Civil War](http://southerneconomyreconstructionand.weebly.com/the-southern-economy-during-reconstruction.html). Monuments to their dead would not have been an immediate priority.

1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.3.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.4. Con: Whether the civil war was primarily about slavery or secondarily about slavery does not change the fact that slavery was a major point of contention. It thus remains difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate the promotion of slavery from the continued veneration of Confederate figures.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.4.1. Con: Americans can honor their ancestors who fought in the Confederacy for their sacrifices, be glad that the South lost, and still abhor slavery at the same time.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: Honoring your ancestors does not mean you have to honor their ideals. Slavery was an ideology. The word Heritage is in relation to property or possessions. So unless you want to honor the ideology of slavery, Confederate leaders should not be honored in the form of statues. Rank and file soldiers are entirely different, and there's a place to remember Confederate history in a museum. That doesn't include honoring the ideology of slavery which was written into the Confederate Constitution.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Many of the confederate monuments are precisely to honor the soldiers' sacrifices. See the famous and controversial "Silent Sam" on UNC campus. [SilentSam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Sam). The country, and even world, are loaded with statues of generals from those wars. For just a few, see, [Patton](http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMGG51_General_George_Smith_Patton_Jr_Boston_MA), [Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenhower_Monument), [Eisenhower,](https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/dwight-d-eisenhower) [MacArthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_places_named_for_Douglas_MacArthur), etc. Not to mention major statues of nearly every significant general in the revolutionary war, including Lafayette and Baron von Steuben.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.4.1.2. Con: The notion that these monuments honor these people for anything other than their white supremacy is refuted by the absence of statues to Longstreet. Longstreet was Lee's most trusted general, but in the aftermath of the war he advocated reconciling with the former enemy and worked in political coalitions with the newly freed citizens.  And yet there are virtually no [monuments](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/23/opinions/where-are-monuments-to-confederate-general-longstreet-opinion-holmes/index.html) to Longstreet
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: In fact, [it is arguable](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/23/opinions/where-are-monuments-to-confederate-general-longstreet-opinion-holmes/index.html) that Longstreet's omission from representation was a deliberate punishment for his pro-reconciliation attitudes.
1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.4.1.3. Con: You can also do all those things without statues honoring the men that did commit treason in order to perpetrate slavery with the understanding that those statues represent racism, regardless of to what degree, and as such cause many members of your community pain.
1.1.3.2.1.1.6. Con: The federal abuse that The Confederacy seceded for was the outlaw of slavery.  Slavery was an unbelievably clear infringement on the freedom rights of black slaves.  While States' Rights are an absolutely fundamental aspect of our government, States should have never had the power to declare that one race of people could legally own another race of people as property.  The accusation of federal abuse is invalid, the Federal Government was simply enforcing American laws and ideals.
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1. Con: Protection of slavery was not the primary reason for secession by Southern states. It was due to [tariffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrill_Tariff) on cotton, imposed by the Congress, to stop the South from selling to England, thus protecting the Northern mills.
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.1. Con: This claim is contrary to documented history. The primary sources of each state's Declaration of Secession prove this assertion to be incorrect. Each state's document either directly references the northern opposition to the institution of slavery, or it implies it by making property rights claims or the right of the state to govern its property, the property in question of course being human beings. [declaration\(s\) of secession by state.](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/ordinances_secession.asp)
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.2. Con: The tariffs were put in place to promote cotton mills that were not using slavery, and thus was a primary reason
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: The Republican Platform of [1860](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=29620) argues for promoting tariffs in order to promote industry: "That, while providing revenue for the support of the general government by duties upon imports, sound policy requires such an adjustment of these imports as to encourage the development of the industrial interests of the whole country;"
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.2.2. Pro: Congress had already been using tariffs as a [mechanism](http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/Web/THM1816?OpenDocument) to  promote industry and raise revenues for decades prior to 1860 this point.
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.3. Pro: The Federal Government derived most of its revenue at the time from Federal import duties and tariffs mostly collected against Southern exporters, and had spent significant funds benefitting mostly Northern interests.
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.3.1. Pro: "The import-dependent South was paying as much as 80 percent of the tariff, while complaining bitterly that most of the revenues were being spent in the North. The South was being plundered by the tax system and wanted no more of it." [–Mises Institute, Lincoln's Tariff War](https://mises.org/library/lincolns-tariff-war)
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.3.2. Pro: The [Morrill bill](https://mises.org/library/lincolns-tariff-war) raised the average tariff rate from about 15 percent to 37.5 percent, but with a greatly expanded list of covered items. The tax burden would nearly triple. Soon thereafter, a second tariff increase would increase the average rate to over 47 percent. The Senate passed the bill on March 2, 1861, two days before Lincoln’s inauguration.
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.3.3. Pro: In 1860, the United States Treasury was in [financial crisis](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/270082/pdf), with less than $500,000 on hand and millions in unpaid bills. The Union urgently needed new revenue. "The [impetus](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/418986/pdf) for revising the tariff arose as an attempt to augment revenue, stave off 'ruin,' and address the accumulating debt."
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.3.4. Pro: In the period prior to and including 1860, [tariffs](http://www.taxmuseum.org/Museum/1816-1860.htm) were by far the chief source of government revenue. Most tariffs were levied against the South.
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.3.5. Pro: In the 1860s, the US government was heavily [subsidizing](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/development-west/essays/financing-transcontinental-railroad) railroad interests, giving away land and paying $16,000 per mile to railroad companies for laying tracks.
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.3.6. Pro: At the time of the Civil War, [railroads](http://www.american-rails.com/railroads-in-the-civil-war.html) were much more extensive in and beneficial to the North than the South.
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.3.7. Pro: [The Bank Panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1857) of 1857 was caused primarily by interests in the North, but the South through increased tariffs was being asked to fund the recovery.
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.3.8. Pro: United States [tariff laws](http://www.dailyprogress.com/opinion/guest_columnists/protective-tariffs-primary-cause-of-the-civil-war/article_63b77f5c-dc0c-11e2-8e99-001a4bcf6878.html) that went into effect in 1861 hurt the South and helped the North.
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.4. Con: The notion that the tariffs were a cause, rather than the effect, of Southern secession has been [debunked](https://imperialglobalexeter.com/2015/03/02/debunking-the-civil-war-tariff-myth/).
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.4.1. Pro: Southern states began seceding in December 1860. The Morrill Tariff was not passed until March 1861.
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.4.1.1. Con: The Morrill Tariff and other similar tariffs were being discussed and debated well before 1861.
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.5. Con: To assign the causes of either secession or the Civil War to cotton or slavery are not mutually exclusive alternatives.  Indeed, the practice of slavery was central to and inextricably linked to the cotton [economy](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/why-was-cotton-king/).
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.2. Con: Slavery existed in both the North and the South at the time of the Civil War.
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Union States Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri had nearly 430,000 slaves in the [1860 census](https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/overview/1860.html).

1.1.3.2.1.1.6.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.
1.1.3.2.1.1.6.5. Con: The Civil War was not about the well being of Blacks. It was of power, as the South plantation owners used slave population for shares in congressional seating. The North were just as racist if not more as they didn't even want blacks and made laws against most from migrating there unless they had a "good-behavior" bond.

1.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Many in the South were deeply religious, and many religious groups in both the North and South had denounced slavery as evil.
1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Those who fought and maintained slavery either were hypocrites, delusional, or were ignoring their faith in this regard.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: During this period everyone in the nation was deeply divided, both in the North and South. None of this was nearly as cut and dry as some seem to believe.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Families fought against each other wearing different colored uniforms.](http://www.crossroadsofwar.org/discover-the-story/communities-at-war/civil-war-stories/)
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: People used religion to both defend and attack slavery.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: The Union claimed the Confederacy violated rights of slaves.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4. Pro: The Union violated some Constitutional rights of Confederate states, and many Confederate states claimed they seceded to restore them.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: Southern states accepted the Constitution and became part of the United States because they thought their rights would be protected. The Southern states seceded because they felt betrayed by the Northern states and federal government who they felt had acted against them in violation of the Constitution even before the Civil War.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: The Southern states felt that their rights to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness, mentioned in the Declaration of Independence, as well as state sovereignty, mentioned in the Constitution, were being curtailed by the activities of the North, and [said so in their declarations of secession](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states).
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Many in the South fought to separate from the North because they saw it as separating itself from the ideals that the nation was founded on, such as the [right to life and "Governments ... deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."](http://www.ushistory.org/Declaration/document/)
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Robert E. Lee was personally against slavery but joined the army to defend his home state.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The linked letter was written to the president explaining why he opposed the Abolitionists. While he did admit that slavery is a "political and moral evil", he proceeded afterward to explain why he was not against it. It reads as if he knowingly supports what he claims is a political and moral evil.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Lincoln was not egalitarian and stated many times his views that whites were superior to blacks, often infuriating the "extremist Republicans" in the North.

This claim is here is not to impugn Lincoln's character, but to show that Lee was likely as anti-slavery and egalitarian as Lincoln was.

There was not as huge a gap between the cause of the Union and the Confederacy regarding these matters as many appear to believe.

1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The letter that Lee writes asserts that slavery is an evil, not to Blacks but to whites.  Additionally, it rejects the thesis of abolition.  In both these ways, it claims to be against slavery in general while nonetheless defending the Southern practice of slavery.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: “Save in the defense of my native State, I never desire again to draw my sword.” – Robert E. Lee
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: This is made clear as the central thesis of [the article](http://www.historynet.com/a-question-of-loyalty-why-did-robert-e-lee-join-the-confederacy.htm) in the very first sentence: "ROBERT E. LEE should not be understood as a figure defined primarily by his Virginia identity."
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Robert E. Lee was never a figure defined primarily by his Virginia identity, but he was a patriot and firm defender of his homeland, and said so multiple times.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: “If Virginia stands by the old Union, so will I. But if she secedes \(though I do not believe in secession as a constitutional right, nor that there is sufficient cause for revolution\), then I will follow my native State with my sword, and, if need be, with my life.” – [Robert E. Lee](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1774465.May_I_Quote_You_General_Forrest_)
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: "In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country." –[Robert E. Lee](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/us/robert-e-lee-slaves.html)
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: That quote, from a private letter, [continues](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/the-myth-of-the-kindly-general-lee/529038/), "I think it however a greater evil to the white man than to the black race \[...\] The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially & physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race." Publicly, Lee argued against the enfranchisement of blacks and against racial equality.

1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: "So far from engaging in a war to perpetuate slavery, I am rejoiced that Slavery is abolished. I believe it will be greatly for the interest of the South. So fully am I satisfied of this that I would have cheerfully lost all that I have lost by the war, and have suffered all that I have suffered to have this object attained." –[Robert E. Lee](http://www.historynet.com/robert-e-lee-quotes)
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.6. Con: In [Reading the Man](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/the-myth-of-the-kindly-general-lee/529038/), the historian Elizabeth Brown Pryor writes that  “by 1860 he had broken up every family but one on the estate, some of whom had been together since Mount Vernon days.” The separation of slave families was one of the most unfathomably devastating aspects of slavery, and Pryor wrote that Lee’s slaves regarded him as “the worst man I ever see.”
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.7. Con: Lee’s [Army of Northern Virginia](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/the-myth-of-the-kindly-general-lee/529038/) enslaved free blacks and brought them back to the South as property
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.8. Pro: "I can anticipate no greater calamity for the country than a dissolution of the Union. It would be an accumulation of all the evils we complain of, & I am willing to sacrifice every thing but honour for its preservation." –[Robert E.

1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.9. Pro: Robert E. Lee opposed secession, but fought for his homeland when he was called upon to defend it.

1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.9.3. Pro: "They do not know what they say. If it came to a conflict of arms, the war will last at least four years. Northern politicians will not appreciate the determination and pluck of the South, and Southern politicians do not appreciate the numbers, resources, and patient perseverance of the North. Both sides forget that we are all Americans. I foresee that our country will pass through a terrible ordeal, a necessary expiation, perhaps, for our national sins." –[Robert E. Lee](https://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/clyde-wilson-library/robert-e-lee-and-the-american-union/)
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.10. Pro: Robert E. Lee distrusted the abolitionists' motives.

1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.10.2. Pro: "Lee understood that the Northern attack on slavery was not benevolent or responsible but rather self-interested, irresponsible, and malicious. He had no reason to think that peaceful and prosperous Virginia… was evil… when it was common knowledge that in New York City were… women and children working 16 hour days for starvation wages, 150,000 unemployed, 40,000 homeless, 600 brothels, and 9,000 grog shops where the poor could temporarily drown their misery."–[Robert E.

1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: The Confederates should be honoured as they were not an 'unjust army'. Their states saw secession as a last resort due to their guaranteed rights under the Constitution - that brought the nation together - being violated by anti-Southern leaders and their allies. For the Confederacy, the war was a regrettable, but righteous and a dignified cause.

1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.4. Con: The abuses that the South claimed were those of violating property rights, namely, owning people as property. The conflict leading up to the war was about the slaveholders' claim that they had a right to take people as property anywhere, and the anti-slavery claim that they could not expand it. The pro-slavery leaders held Federal power for decades. When a moderate anti-slavery man became president, they seceded so as to expand their slave society as an independent nation.[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMMjmIe2hTk&index=6&list=PLSuwqsAnJMtyg3ROpOADVoW1NV5kmskFM)

Pro: From the Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of [South Carolin](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states#South_Carolina)a from the Federal Union, it states that South Carolina seceded because of "the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery."

1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.3.

1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.3.1. Con: Confederate States were forced to accept reintegration into the Union by military might. It was never popularly accepted.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.3.2. Con: There is still [significant popular support for secession in the South](http://blogs.reuters.com/jamesrgaines/2014/09/19/one-in-four-americans-want-their-state-to-secede-from-the-u-s-but-why/) because of disagreements in how the nation is being run.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.4. Con: The Southern states seceded because they felt specifically that their right to practice slavery would be threatened by the federal government, as stated in many of their Declarations of Secession. Slavery being a moral abomination, regardless of its constitutionality, they were only betrayed insofar as they were denied the ability to oppress the slaves they owned.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.4.2. Con: Some states left the union after the North refused to let the south leave peacefully and never mentioned slavery as being their reason for leaving in their declarations of secession. If [Virginia](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states#virginia) was just fighting to keep slavery, they would have echoed Mississippi's secession papers, but they didn't. They stayed focused on the Confederacy's right to exist, and their revulsion at being compelled to pull them back in through war
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.4.2.1. Con: The Virginia secession ordinance considers that the Federal Government perverted its powers "to the oppression of the Southern [Slaveholding](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states#virginia) States". Before, in 1847, the state threatened to break the Union  over the [Wilmot Proviso](http://www.confederatepastpresent.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=110:virginia-threatens-to-break-up-the-union-over-the-wilmot-proviso-march-8-1847&catid=41:the-gathering-storm), a bill that wanted to prohibit slavery in the territories acquired during the Mexican American War.

1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.4.5. Pro: From the Declaration of the Causes which Impel the State of [Texas](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states#Texas) to Secede from the Federal Union: "That the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, ...\[and\]  while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races, as advocated by our sectional enemies, would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states".

1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.2.2.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.5. Con: Confederate monuments  are not memorials to the insistence of constitutional rights, they are reminders that the people living where they were erected praised the white supremacist stance of the confederacy.
1.1.3.2.3. Pro: Many soldiers who fought for the confederacy were not themselves slaveowners.
1.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: To suggest that hundreds of thousands of confederate soldiers that fought for the south really cared at all about slavery is ridiculous.  Slaves were insanely expensive to purchase and take care of.  Think Civil War era "one percent"-ers.  The average Joe didn't put his life at risk so some rich guys could own slaves to keep their profit margins high.
1.1.3.2.3.1.1. Con: However, poor whites who did fight had incentive to preserve a system where they were not at the lowest rung of society, where they would not be considered property. They could be despised and considered low-class, and even as indentured servants, yes, but they would not be considered to be very expensive livestock. To be enslaved is a much different status than that of an indentured servant in America at this time, as far as the law was concerned.
1.1.3.2.3.2. Con: Many German soldiers who fought in World War II were not themselves Nazi fascists who personally supported the Holocaust. That does not mean people still use Nazi symbolism to commemorate them.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: Germany is, publicly, almost entirely [de-Nazified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification). They instead have [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Military_and_war_museums_in_Germany) museums, holocaust museums, and [memorials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holocaust_memorials_and_museums) to the [victims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe), not the perpetrators.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: The fact that Germany [outlaws Nazi Symbolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafgesetzbuch_section_86a) has not in any way propelled Germany towards fascism again.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1.2. Con: [Germany passed a law that prohibits speech or art that refers to Nazism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafgesetzbuch_section_86a) This law would be unconstitutional in the USA.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: In the United States, the First Amendment prohibits government stopping expression of belief.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1.2.1.1. Con: The removal of monuments by their owner does not violate the 1st amendment.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Regardless if public monuments exist, an individual's right to believe in and express confederate ideologies is not impacted.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: "The First Amendment guarantees freedoms concerning religion, expression, assembly, and the right to petition.  It forbids Congress from both promoting one religion over others and also restricting an individual’s religious practices." -- [Cornell Law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment)
1.1.3.2.3.2.1.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.2.1.2.1.1.1.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1.2.1.4. Pro: Flags are an expression of a belief and that is a universal right.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1.3. Con: Jewish people do not ask to tear down monuments to the Holocaust, in fact they support the monuments and the [Auschwitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp#Auschwitz-Birkenau_State_Museum) museum so that they won't be forgotten.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1.3.1. Con: Holocaust [memorials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holocaust_memorials_and_museums) honor the victims, they do not, in any case, celebrate [perpetrators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafgesetzbuch_section_86a).
1.1.3.2.3.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: The memorial at Birkenau reads: "For ever let this place be a cry of despair and a warning to humanity, where the Nazis murdered about one and a half million men, women, and children, mainly Jews from various countries of Europe."
1.1.3.2.3.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: Concentration camps don't honor the perpetrators of the horrible acts. Confederate statues, on the other hand, honor those who fought for slavery.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1.3.1.3. Pro: One cannot possibly consider this memorial in [Senagal](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/388928117790808581/) is recognizing the same perspective and interpretation of history as this memorial in [Charlottesville](http://wvir.images.worldnow.com/images/13907138_G.jpg).
1.1.3.2.3.2.2. Pro: Honoring confederate veterans is comparable to honoring German WWII veterans, because "they fought for their homeland." Both sides fought wars over the right to oppress others, and neither should be honored for this.
1.1.3.2.3.3. Con: Though many didn't own slaves they fought to maintain their way of life which included slavery.
1.1.3.2.3.3.1. Con: Those who didn't own slaves had little or no economic incentive to preserve slavery, certainly not at the very possible cost of their lives.
1.1.3.2.3.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.1.1.

1.1.3.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.1.
1.1.3.2.8. Con: Slavery was the primary or secondary cause of these other issues. This was because it was a major issue at center of all matters in the South's economy.
1.1.3.2.8.1. Pro: The economic issues of the south were almost all entirely centered around slavery.
1.1.3.2.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.
1.1.3.2.8.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.
1.1.3.2.8.1.3. Con: Less than a third of families in the South owned slaves. In many Confederate states, only a quarter of families or less were slave owners. \([Census figures from 1860](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html)\)
1.1.3.2.8.1.3.1. Pro: Among slave situations, not all were fundamentally abusive.  Some people treated their slaves with dignity, and thereby forged positive interracial relationships that wouldn't have been probable otherwise.

[selections from Dewar Gleissner](https://www.quora.com/Did-any-Southern-slave-owners-have-good-employee-relations-with-their-slaves/answer/John-Dewar-Gleissner)
1.1.3.2.8.1.3.1.1. Con: It does not matter how a slave was treated, they are still enslaved. They lacked autonomy, basic human rights, and freedom. That in itself is an abuse.

1.1.3.2.9. Pro: Many slave owners in the South believed that slavery was immoral and supported gradually phasing it out, as had been done in the North, but believed that immediate emancipation of all slaves was dangerous.
1.1.3.2.9.1. Pro: John Brown's actions to attempt to arm slaves were glorified by many Northerners.
1.1.3.2.9.2. Pro: [Many abolitionists supported, or at least refused to condemn, the violent freeing of slaves.](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/abolitionists-john-brown)
1.1.3.2.9.3. Pro: [Many people, both north and south, believed that a mass freeing of slaves was dangerous, and even discussing emancipation had started riots.](http://www.historynet.com/abolitionist-movement)
1.1.3.2.9.3.1. Pro: "In 1833 in Philadelphia, the first American Anti-Slavery Society Convention convened. In a backlash, anti-abolition riots broke out in many northeastern cities, including New York and Philadelphia. In Illinois, the legislature voted to condemn abolition societies and their agitation \[which Abraham Lincoln voted for\]; The U.S. House of Representatives adopted a gag rule, automatically tabling abolitionist proposals." [–HistoryNet: Abolitionist Movement](http://www.historynet.com/abolitionist-movement)
1.1.3.2.10. Con: All of those issues revolve around the issue of slavery. The civil war was inextricably linked to slavery.
1.1.3.2.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.8.1.
1.1.3.2.10.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.

1.1.3.2.11. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.8.1.3.
1.1.3.2.12. Pro: The civil war was often called a rich man's war that the poor men fought. The greater majority of the men who fought for the confederacy were not slave owners. Truth be told, their state \(country\) seceded and went to war. These men weren't defending slavery, they were defending their homes, their farms, and their livelihood. That being said, there was a reason the President Andrew Johnson pardoned confederate soldiers.
1.1.3.2.13. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.
1.1.3.2.14. Con: The Confederacy was outspoken that slavery was a fundamental building block.

1.1.3.2.14.9. Pro: Even the confederate soldiers claimed that they fought over slavery.
1.1.3.2.14.9.1. Pro: The editors from the Richmond based [Southern Punch](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/06/19/how-people-convince-themselves-that-the-confederate-flag-represents-freedom-not-slavery/?utm_term=.f6baca175fac) stated in 1864: "Our doctrine is this: We are fighting for independence that our great and necessary domestic institution of slavery shall be preserved, and for the preservation of other institutions of which slavery is the groundwork.”
1.1.3.2.14.9.2. Pro: [Confederate veteran](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/06/19/how-people-convince-themselves-that-the-confederate-flag-represents-freedom-not-slavery/?utm_term=.f6baca175fac) Ed Baxter unashamedly told a reunion in 1889: “In a word, the South determined to fight for her property right in slaves; and in order to do so, it was necessary for her resist the change which the Abolitionists proposed to make under the Constitution of the United States as construed by them. . . Upon this issue the South went to war.”
1.1.3.2.15. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.6.1.3.
1.1.3.2.16. Con: Championing states' rights assumes that the rights of the state take precedence over rights of humans. The constitution clearly upholds [human rights](https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-09/) over the state and instead supports an individual's right retaliate against an [oppressive state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unenumerated_rights#In_the_United_States), which is what America was founded upon.
1.1.3.2.16.1. Con: The Confederacy's arguments for state's rights were in opposition to the Federal Government's rights, not individual rights. Their argument was that the state's right to self-determination was more important than the federal government's right to enforce national law \(such as slave emancipation\).
1.1.3.3. Pro: The statues of Confederate generals/leaders are being removed because of what the monument is glorifying: a vision of slavery and white supremacy. George Washington's monuments glorify his leadership and his vision of the USA, not his ownership of slaves.  His statue is therefore not representative of oppression, just as Winston Churchill's statues are not representative of colonialism. Thus, the latter two, and others like them, will not be removed.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: Many people do not believe Confederate statues represent oppression.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Public support for retaining Confederate monuments shows that the majority of Americans feel it is moral to allow these monuments to remain.
1.1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: Nationwide, 6 in 10 Americans say the monuments should [remain](http://www.npr.org/2017/08/23/545435024/civil-rights-activist-argues-to-keep-confederate-monuments?sc=tw).
1.1.3.3.1.1.2. Con: The majority opinion is not indicative of the correct opinion: argumentum ad populum.
1.1.3.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Free people will disagree on specifics. The United States is a representative republic with the majority of power in the hands of people that make up the states.
1.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Because America is a republic, the government cannot be considered "the people", which goes against the initial claim that the government is the people.
1.1.3.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: Democracy is a flawed system that assumes the voter is knowledgeable about what is being voted on.
1.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Confederate flags and monuments are more widely regarded as symbols representing Southern culture, heritage, and history - all good things. To remove these monuments is to make an unwarranted advance on those cultural boundaries.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1. Con: These statues were erected to oppress Black people in our country during the Jim Crow era, and thus have no place on government buildings and property that should represent all Americans.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Public displays reach people that museums do not.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2. Con: Having our history all around us in the form of historical landmarks can be a better teacher than books or museums. Being immersed in history and seeing it everywhere you go can be far more effective than hiding it away in books and private museums that most people are never likely to see or read.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.1. Con: These books are often taught in public schools. They are not being hidden away.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.2. Con: It would be just as easy to argue that having monuments all over make them as boring and uninteresting as furniture. Just part of the scenery, not part of our history.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.3. Pro: [Multi-sensory learning](https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/partnering-with-childs-school/instructional-strategies/multisensory-instruction-what-you-need-to-know), such as [what happens in field trips](http://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/why-we-need-to-save-field-trips.shtml), is more effective than reading a book or a lecture in a classroom.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4. Con: It is important to note that these are not just symbols of history, but also of racism. Being immersed in symbols of racism and seeing it everywhere you go can be far more effective \(to teach racism\) than hiding it away in books and private museums that most people are never likely to see or read.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.1. Con: One does not erect statues depicting ideologies.  Ideological spin is what we impart, or project, onto them, after the fact. And often with modern biases.  Monuments depict only people at places and honoring the events surrounding them.  Attacking ideologies should not be conflated with attacking bronze.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.4. Con: Being immersed in symbols of racism is what allows racism to endure in society. If these symbols are removed, then perhaps society can move beyond them and racism can eventually be overcome.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.4.1. Con: At times and places it is worse, but tribalism and racism isn't a national problem, it's a human one. These problems have existed throughout history and exist today everywhere where there is significant diversity.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.4.1.1. Pro: Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos claimed that those who lived in Alexandria were superior.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.4.1.2. Pro: There has been [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocides_in_history) and many wars fought over nothing more than cultural, belief system and ancestral differences.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.4.1.3. Pro: Passages as diverse as the Rigveda and Scandanavian poetry have been claimed to be racist.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.5. Pro: Taking Confederate monuments down could create a false sense of accomplishment for some which could hide the reality that racism is far from dead. It is better to keep them up as a monument to everything that happened and as a warning to encourage people to be constantly vigilant and to be wary of people on both sides who are eager to re-write history for their own narrow ends.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.1.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.6. Con: We must consider what is being taught. The image of a confederate general, sword in hand, looking noble atop his steed does not teach "slavery was wrong and this man was wrong to betray his country to fight for it". The fact that being surrounded by history is a good teacher means we must be more selective about whom we honor in this way, not less.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3. Con: Museums are as subjective as memorials. They create an image of history that arises from the current political climate. To move statutes into a museum is akin to changing the statute physically or destroying it.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Modern [curatorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator) practices are quite sensitive to these kinds of concerns and work specifically to preserve history in a context sensitive way.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Something as controversial as Confederate monuments are impossible to present or reinterpret today in a way that [intersectional identitarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics#Intersectional_critiques) and descendants of fallen Confederate soldiers will both accept as respectful.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Some of the descendants of Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, and Stonewall Jackson have [issued statements](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/16/us/robert-e-lees-grandson-comments-on-statue-removal/index.html) supporting the removal of statues honoring their ancestors. Since the people with the highest stake in carrying on these men's legacies want them taken down, then clearly doing so is not an affront to their memory.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Some descended from Confederate leaders [don't want the monuments taken down.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/us/lee-family-confederate-monuments-legacy.html)
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: These "memorials" were often [erected with and are still maintained with private funds](http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20170822/charlestons-civil-war-soldier-statues-erected-with-private-funds). They provided a place where families could gather to remember those who never returned home. They are American soldiers just as much as Union soldiers are American soldiers yet they do not enjoy the same respect.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.2. Con: If satisfaction is impossible, can removing some confederate statues to museums be considered uniquely unsatisfactory?
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Moving Confederate statues or monuments, or doing any new presentation of them whatsoever, is going to be objected to vigorously by someone.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: There must be some relative difference between the objections, either in nature or magnitude, or the fact that there's no difference nullifies any reason policymakers might have to respond to popular will. Only if there's a difference can that difference matter.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.3. Con: Museums are created and funded in order to preserve history in as neutral and fair way as possible without bias or agenda. Existence of several Holocaust museums proves this much. Despite the terrible history connected to them, the museums about them must exist so that the history is never forgotten and he knowledge of what happened is always preserved. While naturally there are exceptions to this rule, the movement of all Confederate history to museums is not an insult: It is preservation.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4. Con: It makes no sense to say that history does not belong in the public sphere and, at the same time, it is unfair that those currently in power can decide which part of history to erase/remove just because they do not agree with it.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.1. Pro: There is no objective standard by which to determine a monument is supportive of the Confederacy's goals.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Selecting who should decide which heroes are memorialized and what those memorials stand for is controversial.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3. Pro: It is difficult and highly subjective to establish who has the legitimacy to decide about someone else’s legacy and if that legacy is harmful enough to warrant erasure.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.1. Con: In the words of the leaders who promoted the values of those depicted in these statues: "Slavery is the reason we fight". The Confederate constitution, and each of its state's constitutions made clear that slavery mattered the most. [Article I, Section 9, Clause 4](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_csa.asp) states: "No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed."  The troops memorialized in those statues reflect those values.

1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2. Con: If the statue is on private property, then the owner has legitimacy. If it is on public property, the government has legitimacy, as is the case with any other public monument.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1. Con: In the United States, the government is the people. If the people want to have a monument in their town, and pay for it, no one should be able to say otherwise.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: "The government" is not synonymous with "the people".
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The Constitution, which is the highest law of the land, uses "the people" synonymously with "the state," except as a subdivision of the people.

In the United States, the people are the government, and the government represents the will of the people or is illegitimate.

President Lincoln famously referred to this principle as "government of the people, by the people, for the people."
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: America is a republic, which takes the power away from the people. The terms are not synonymous.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The United States of America is a representative republic, which does not take power away from the people.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Republics exist to prevent total rule by the people.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: [The United States representative republic was created to empower the people to elect representatives that will act in the interests of the people, but not sway to every hot-headed, flash-in-the-pan, emotional issue.](http://www.foundingfatherquotes.com/articles/22)
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Republics often use geographical representation, the majority in an area is represented, rather than individual representation, a person's views being represented regardless of majority in an area. As such they take power away from the people to express their ideas.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: No system of government exists that represents everyone's desires in a society.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: This is not exclusive to republics. Representative Democracies achieve the same goal without violating the will of the people.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: There are no true Democracies operating in the world today.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Representative republics are republics, governed by law, with democratically elected representatives that craft those laws based on popular support, personal experience, moral tradition, and precedence from other laws.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The United States is not "majority rules," that would be Democracy. The United States is a Representative Republic, meaning it was never designed to be a pure Democracy.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.2. Con: This ignores individuals who who don't want the monument and are still forced to pay for it.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.2.1. Con: Monument upkeep is nearly zero unless vandalized.

1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3. Con: In most cases, it's local [municipalities](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/16/us/confederate-monuments-removed.html) and state legislatures who are voting to have them removed and preserved elsewhere.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.1. Con: Many state legislatures have made it [illegal](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-confederate-monument-laws-20170815-htmlstory.html) to remove monuments.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Those laws may and should be overturned at the voters' discretion.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2. Con: In many states and localities where they are situated, support for keeping monuments and other artifacts remains high.

1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: The [Baltimore](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baltimore-confederate-statues_us_5994274fe4b009141641806b) city council removed four monuments over night, after a year of postponing a final decision on the matter.

1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.3. Con: Most Confederate statues were a reaction to Reconstruction and were part of the rise of the KKK. Now in my City, the dominant political force is African American \(60%\). Many are now demanding these offensive tributes to their subjugation be removed. It is a reflection of who has power, just like the statues' placements were a reflection of the reassertion of White power after the Civil War.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.4. Pro: There is [support](http://www.npr.org/2017/08/23/545435024/civil-rights-activist-argues-to-keep-confederate-monuments?sc=tw) across African-Americans as 44% believe Confederate memorials should stay and 40% percent say they should be removed.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.4.1. Con: Regardless of the mere 4% more African-Americans who support keeping the statues, the point remains that they honor a racially unjust system rather than modern ideals.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.4.1.1. Con: If a plurality of African-Americans support leaving Confederate monuments in place, and most have been left in place, it shows that the system is not broken, and that principles of freedom and self-governance are alive and well in the United States. Critics often assert that the opposite is true.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.4.2. Con: A larger percentage believing they should stay does not indicate support across the group of people when it's not a majority and 44% is not a majority of African Americans.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.4.2.1. Pro: Among African Americans, 40% support removal and 16% are not sure, therefore 56% do not actively [support](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/16/543957964/poll-majority-believe-trump-s-response-to-charlottesville-hasn-t-been-strong-eno) keeping monuments in place.

1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.7. Con: Appeals to public opinion cannot help us decide questions of right or wrong unless we are willing to accept that there is no fixed right or wrong.  What is right from this perspective is whatever most people happen say it is at a given moment.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.7.1. Con: The purpose of a republic is to put trust in leaders to break with the majority when they are exhibiting a mob mentality and other tyrannical behaviors.

1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.3. Pro: Women often do not accept men's interpretations on Women's Suffrage. Blacks often do not accept whites interpretation of their culture and history. Catholics do not accept Protestants' version of their history.

1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.5. Con: There is a difference between erasure and the removal of statues. The OP is about public spaces, not the rewriting of history.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.6. Con: We can, in fact, establish why these statues were erected: they were erected to promote the Southern version of the war and to maintain the "Lost Cause" and White Supremacy. These statues were intended not only to celebrate to perpetuate white supremacy and inspire the South's youth to maintain it. We know that they were erected to enshrined a mythical history well wide of the documentable past by people who actively suppressed any dissent from their mythical version of history.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.7. Con: No it's not.  Slavery was wrong, and the civil war was fought to preserve the right to continue enslaving Africans.  It's not subjective, it's simply wrong.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.4. Con: On the street are to be kept the statues of those that are still in line with our present values and we still honor, not of those who fought against our present values when they were emerging ones.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.4.2. Con: Many people consider values of the Confederacy relevant and worthwhile today including states' rights, local determination and governance, financial fairness in government, and a respect for cultural values and customs.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.4.2.1. Con: The removal of statues from public property does not preclude their erection on private property.  Retention of such statues on private property is protected by both property rights and the First Amendment.  Therefore, the removal of these statues from public spaces is not mutually exclusive with their preservation for any reason other than the representation of prevailing or ubiquitous values.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5. Con: By the same arguments statues of Hitler and Mussolini should still appear in Germany and Italy just because they once were there. In 2003, Saddam Hussein's statues shouldn't have been destroyed by the US troops and the Iraqis that helped them.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1. Con: We would not consider Roman and Greek statues controversial. In some years, the Civil War, the Union and the Confederacy will be similar to the Greeks and Romans. Except, if we remove the monuments, the historic artifacts will be lost forever.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1. Con: We do not value \(or devalue\) greek and roman statues and busts for the political statements behind them. Most could not tell the politics of any given ceasar. They are often statues of fictitious figures and we typically value them for their artistic merits; what's more those busts which are of politicians are typically found in museums, where these statues belong.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.1. Con: [Greek statues are commonly found in public areas in Greece.](https://www.triphistoric.com/ancient-greek-sites-and-ruins/pe113)

1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.3. Con: Many consider monuments an expression of heritage that needs preservation.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: [Wikipedia runs a yearly "Wiki Loves Monuments" contest with the tagline "The Wikipedia photo contest around cultural heritage."](https://www.wikilovesmonuments.org/)
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.3.2. Pro: UNESCO protects and funds cultural heritage sites. [Included are many monuments](http://whc.unesco.org/en/search/?criteria=monuments).
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.4. Con: History is learned from many sources. No single source is impartial or complete.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.4.1. Con: The learning of history from many sources is only done by those who *actively* seek multiple sources. Unfortunately, we all know that those seekers of nuance are fairly rare in the attention economy we have today.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: The problem is also epistemological. It is difficult to determine when exactly has one  gathered enough evidence for a "complete" historical picture.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.4.1.2. Con: Getting in a car accident is fairly rare, however it's adviseable to still get insurance coverage. Just because something is rare doesn't mean it should not be considered
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.5. Con: [Many have not forgotten Greek or Roman history](http://greekandromanstudies.vassar.edu/courses/).
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.6. Con: Many statues are of real people, not just fictitious ones.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.7. Con: If heroic fictitious Roman or Greek statues makes them non-offensive, than the oft-claimed "myth of heroic Confederate leaders" should make them unoffensive as well.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.2. Con: The issue isn't the politics of the historical figures represented in these monuments. It's the politics of why those monuments were put up in the first pace - to advance the false Lost Cause narrative that the civil war was not about slavery, and to enshrine white supremacy.

They aren't historic artefacts, but mass produced propaganda. Many of them are not even unique, many are not actually well made and some are not even of historical figures.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.3. Pro: In the Roman Coliseum, things happened to [Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum#Significance_in_Christianity) that were unspeakable. That it still stands today is not a cause of fear. Historical monuments of any kind eventually become valued antiquities, but only if left to stand. Cities that destroy their history never gain character.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.3.1. Con: Barrow, Alaska, and Tuson, Arizona, are probably older cities than St. Augustine, FL. Long human habitation is simply not enough to make a city of historical interest. There must be some architecture and monuments from each era surviving . Cities "scrub" their histories at great risk.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6. Con: This point falsely implies the statues were indeed history, not erected after the fact during the Jim Crow and Civil Rights era. Given that their erection was an abuse of history, is not their removal a necessary correction?

1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3. Con: We must also remember the descendants of those that served in the Confederate Army have as much right to honor their ancestors as those in the North.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.1. Con: This argument amounts to little more than a negation of the thesis; honoring those who fought for slavery is precisely what we are arguing against in this discussion.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.2. Con: We need to stop teaching future generations that it is okay to honor people who fought tooth and nail against their own country to maintain slavery.

1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.2.3.2. Con: Our nation's monuments are a diverse historic tapestry of  cultures, aspirations, honor, grief, religious expression and political commentary.  Attempting to selectively remove individual threads destroys our collective memory of how this fabric was created.  It also robs our Republic of the strength and unique 'beauty' found in the complex weave of  brilliant colors and fine threads, that exist alongside the coarse and darker strands we often regret were ever placed on the loom.

1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.2.3.2.1. Con: Even if our national monuments are a tapestry of several cultures, public spaces represent constrained and competitive spaces therefore the existence of certain monuments precludes the presence of others.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: There are very few Union monuments in the South. Anyone in the South does not see a tapestry of contrasts, but a monoculture of one type of monument.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.2.3.2.1.1.1. Con: There is no such thing as an impartial view of history. Different cultures, communities, and peoples will have different perceptions on history and its lessons.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.2.3.2.1.1.2. Con: Local residents should determine what to memorialize positive and negative. Rather than silencing/removing monuments, additional monuments may be erected by local residents to offer a contrasting/competing view, if desired.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.2.3.2.1.1.2.1. Con: These memorials are on public land because local democracy has granted them that privilege, and local democracy can revoke it. There is historical context to this; the fact this land was granted to such monuments in the first place is a direct result of the disempowerment of people of colour in American democracy. As American democracy changes, so too should public spaces to reflect the nature of that democracy.

1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.2.3.2.1.1.3. Con: "The problem with the Historical Marker Database is that it catalogs both Confederate and Union markers, and there’s no easy way to separate the two, at least algorithmically. [Many Union markers reside on former Confederate soil, and vice versa.](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2015/07/civil_war_historical_markers_a_map_of_confederate_monuments_and_union_ones.html)"
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.2.3.2.1.1.4. Pro: There are over 700 Confederate Monuments [remaining](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-are-still-more-than-700-confederate-monuments-in-the-u-s/).  The [Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_memorials_to_the_Grand_Army_of_the_Republic) monuments number about 100. An interesting comparison given that the Union won. Usually, these are put up to memorialize a victory or to honor sacrifice. The preponderance of the Confederate statues indicates that they likely represent an ideal. That ideal is that black men are subjugated and second class citizens. 'We hold these truths to be self evident  - All Men are Created [Equal](http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/)'.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.2.3.2.2. Con: Removing certain pieces from public spaces does not remove them from the historic tapestry entirely.

1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.7. Con: If those who currently have the power to control what monuments appear in public spaces do not have the legitimacy to remove the statues, then those who erected them originally did not have the legitimacy to do so. We cannot pick and choose who has control over public spaces based on the group we agree with.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.7.2. Con: The appropriate response is to create new monuments to those who should be honored, not to remove historic monuments to those you disagree with.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.7.2.1. Pro: If government protects all citizens from everything they find unpleasant, the First Amendment will not exist.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.7.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.2.1.2.1.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.8. Pro: By the same logic, anyone in power could also remove women's, civil rights and LGBT memorials if they do not agree with those causes.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.8.1. Con: This would be true, but not necessarily a problem. Each generation decides what values they uphold publically as a society. This has always been true. It is the historian's job to catalog what happened. Putting these statues in a museum in exhibits describing the context of their erection and era records history without glorifying the statue features as heros.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.9. Con: Myriad Confederate statues aren't a necessary condition to keep the Civil War Era in the public sphere.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.10. Con: No one would be erasing anything by putting them in a museum. They would actually be given a proper context to understand them and be properly preserved to last longer in the public's memory.

1.1.3.3.1.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.
1.1.3.3.1.3. Con: Even if they do not believe the statues represent oppression and slavery, their views do not decide what it represents. For example, a statue of Adolf Hitler will always be a symbol of what he stood for, since the very presence of the statue signifies the glorification of his existence. On the other extreme, a statue of Superman would always represent the good and heroic legacy he left behind. Monuments and such will always be representative of the legacy left behind, not the perceived heritage.
1.1.3.3.2. Con: What a monument glorifies relies on point of view and interpretation. In NYC we have a statue of Columbus that is being drawn into this discussion. For some it may be a neutral representation of an historical figure. For others it is a symbol of discovery and opportunity. For others it is a symbol of Italian pride. For others it glorifies colonialism and oppression.
1.1.3.3.2.1. Con: If it is true that a statue's meaning is subjective, then when a significant number of people find a reprehensible meaning in it, it should be removed.
1.1.3.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.1.
1.1.3.4. Con: While white northerners and African-Americans remember confederate heroes "only for defending slavery," many white southerners remember them more as defenders of their land and culture, and forget or do not think often of the role slavery played in this.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: The fact that those who were not oppressed \(white Americans\) forgot or did not take into account the fight of Confederates and its links to slavery, is not enough reason to not consider that link as a problematic legacy that needs amendment.
1.1.3.5. Pro: Washington and Jefferson, while being slaveholders, created and founded the United States of America. The Confederate leaders trashed the democratic process by refusing to accept Lincoln's election, then committed treason and waged war upon the United States, killing more U.S. soldiers than Hitler. And they did so to expand an anti-democratic, imperial oligarchy. Big difference. The country should not erect monuments to those who sought to destroy American democratic government.

1.1.3.6. Pro: Since Washington and Jefferson were not alive at the time of the Confederacy, it should not be assumed that they would have been on the side of the Confederacy had they been alive to make that choice. So objecting to monuments of the Confederacy does not imply that one must object to honoring all slave-holding figures in history.
1.1.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.1.4. Con: The continuation of the ideas in the constitution and the voice of the people matters more than monuments to the men of the past. We can remember the good these people did through the historical record without exalting them in statuary.
1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.
1.1.6. Con: This has not occurred elsewhere in similar situations.
1.1.6.1. Con: German [legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafgesetzbuch_section_86a) prohibits the display of swastikas in public in any form. For example: In 2003, a court decision was required to make allowance for an anti-fascist organization to display crossed-out swastikas. From an American viewpoint, the strictness of anti-Nazi regulations in Germany is exactly the sort of slippery-slope result that should be guarded against.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: Germany also teaches their national shame during WW2 to every student, to ensure it is never forgotten. The belief that removing Confederate statues will result in forgotten history is belied by the German example.
1.1.7. Con: The slippery slope may not be a bad thing. It's about time Americans have a serious discussion about how the country started and exactly what its history represents. No historical figure is sacred. They should all be looked at through the lens of truth.
1.1.8. Con: The United States is designed to express the changing viewpoints of its population.  If enough support exists to eliminate colonial monuments due to the changing values of the U.S. people, then their removal is appropriately measured, not a "slippery slope" result.
1.1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.
1.1.9. Con: Using the "slippery slope" fallacy of logic belies the possibility of middle ground and assumes a discrete transition from category A to category B.
1.1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.1.10. Con: The confederate memorials and monuments are not being removed or renamed because they are representative of oppression.  They are being removed and torn down because they are tools of oppression - erected during the Jim Crow era to intimidate and attempt to control the behavior of People of Color living in the US.  Therefore removing or renaming confederate statues is an unrelated topic to colonial era memorials that are only representative of oppression.
1.1.10.1. Pro: Most Confederate monuments are not particularly old and have likely been put up with the intent to demonstrate dominance over African-Americans during two different time periods: the [Jim Crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws) era \(1900-1918\) and the [Civil Rights Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_\(1954%E2%80%931968\)) era \(1954-1968\) \([SPLC, p. 12](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/whoseheritage_splc.pdf)\).
1.1.10.1.1. Con: There is little to no evidence that bigoted intent was behind most monuments. The only evidence provided shows that most monuments were constructed about 30-60 years after the civil war. Other major national war memorials \(WW2, Vietnam, and Korea\) were erected 59, 7, and 42 years after their respective wars.
1.1.10.1.1.1. Con: "I horse-whipped a negro wench until her skirts hung in shreds, because upon the streets of this quiet village she had publicly insulted and maligned a Southern lady, and then rushed for protection to these University buildings where was stationed a garrison of 100 Federal soldiers. I performed the pleasing duty in the immediate presence of the entire garrison..." -- [Julian Carr](http://hgreen.people.ua.edu/transcription-carr-speech.html), 1913 Dedication of "Silent Sam" Confederate Monument
1.1.10.1.1.1.1. Con: Julian Carr, clearly a racist, and one of the richest men in North Carolina at the time, did not erect the monument, nor take part in it's creation, and showed his terrible racism as one of the celebrities invited to speak at the founding of the monument. This has tainted this monument, but provides no evidence that the monument was erected for racist purposes.
1.1.10.1.1.2. Con: These monuments cannot be compared to the WW2, Vietnam, and Korea monuments. First, because those monuments were constructed to commemorate the fallen soldiers. Second, those monuments are not of people or battles. And third, every monument to a confederate "hero" is a monument to a person who committed treason against the United States of America.
1.1.10.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.4.1.1.1.
1.1.10.1.1.3. Pro: [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/15/joy-reid/did-confederate-symbols-gain-prominence-civil-righ/) rates "Did Confederate symbols gain prominence in the civil rights era?" as mostly false.
1.1.10.1.1.3.1. Con: [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/15/joy-reid/did-confederate-symbols-gain-prominence-civil-righ/) states that the monuments “implicitly symbolized slavery and white violence” and that their placement in courthouses was intentional. Therefore, even if it is not correct that they were erected during the Civil Rights era, the fact that they were “political statements aimed at African-Americans" is correct according to experts.
1.1.10.1.1.3.2. Con: The statement is still true, [the article](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/15/joy-reid/did-confederate-symbols-gain-prominence-civil-righ/) quoted is rating Ms. Reid's statement that the height was in the 1960's which would have been 100 years after the end of the Civil War. The height of the construction of civil war monuments happened between 1900-1920 approximately 30-60 years after the end of the civil war. This is when the Jim Crow laws were introduced to affirm White men were still in charge.
1.1.10.1.2. Con: [White supremacists also use American flags and crosses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan_auxiliaries). We shouldn't allow a small extreme fringe to define what a symbol means in opposition to a local majority.
1.1.10.1.2.1. Con: This doesn't address the parent assertion of racist symbolism for much of the public.
1.1.10.1.2.2. Con: The extreme fringe is not defining what the Confederacy was about, the Confederates did. Slavery and White Supremacy were central tenants of the Confederacy.
1.1.10.1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.1.10.1.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.14.
1.1.10.1.2.2.3. Con: Just because it is some people's experience, doesn't mean that it's everyone's experience nor even a majority of people's experiences.

To say that slavery was central to everything they are known for is exactly the fallacy argumentum ad populum. You are saying because most people feel that way, it is true.

This would not be controversial if everyone, or even most, felt this way, and yet it is controversial.
1.1.10.1.2.2.3.1. Con: It isn't a matter of whether any particular detail is true about the specific lives of the people depicted. Nor is it an argument that it's necessarily a majority who oppose the monuments. It's true that there are people who are upset by the monuments, the question is whether those people's feelings on the matter should inform choices about whether to remove them.
1.1.10.1.2.2.3.2. Con: This is factually false; the claim above said no such thing.

Slavery was central to everything the Confederacy is known for not because "most people feel that way", but because the Confederacy itself, at the time, expressly proclaimed that slavery was central to their cause.
1.1.10.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.1.10.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.2.2.
1.1.10.1.5. Con: Without primary sources, it is impossible to know whether or not dominance over African Americans was the motivating factor in erecting statues - which is different than it being the result. You cannot infer motive based solely on the timing of the monuments construction. One of the first rules of logic is "Correlation does not entail causation."
1.1.10.1.5.1. Con: You certainly can infer motivation based on timing when combined with circumstance. If a person stands outside a business at the moment it is about to open, you may reasonably infer that they intend to enter. That inference would be unreasonable if they stood outside while the business is open.
1.1.10.1.5.2. Con: The primary documents do show dominance over African Americans as the primary causes for secession.

"The people of Georgia ... present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation. ...with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have  ... persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property..."

Civil war heroes fought for slavery which is antithetical to modern values.

[www.civilwar.org](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states)
1.1.10.1.5.3. Con: Correlation studies while not ideal are often used in sociology and correlation is often used to add evidence to an argument.
1.1.10.1.5.4. Con: There are primary sources to confirm the motivating factors for erecting Civil War monuments during the Jim Crow Era. The groups who paid and/or advocated for them leave documents. For example, the [United Daughters of the Confederacy](https://www.splcenter.org/20180604/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy#lost-cause) were behind many statues and have left a trail of documents where they promote the Lost Cause \(also called the Dunning School\) narrative.
1.1.10.1.5.4.1. Pro: Several monuments were built by a pro-Confederacy group of women known as the [United Daughters of the Confederacy](https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/United_Daughters_of_the_Confederacy). This group is well documented to promote [alternative histories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOkFXPblLpU) written by Confederacy loyalists; not American loyalists.
1.1.10.1.6. Pro: [Many of the statues glorifying the Confederacy were constructed in protest to Civil Rights](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/whoseheritage_splc.pdf) or in support of White Nationalism. The history of the construction of particular memorials should be made transparent to the community and taken into account in determining whether to keep or remove the memorial.
1.1.10.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.
1.1.10.1.6.2. Con: The United States was divided into the Union and Confederacy during the Civil War. The United States today survives with the legacies, descendants, and heritage of both the Union and Confederacy.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1. Pro: President Lincoln went to great efforts to pardon and celebrate the heroes of the South, which is how he helped heal the wounds and rebind the country after the Civil War. This current thrust is to do the opposite and it seems to push us closer towards civil war again.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: The ["Great Compromise"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCjfYP_5ASM) was that the South would willingly admit preservation of the Union was good and the North would recognize that Southerners fought honorably for a cause in which they believed. That's why the Federal posts established after the War were named for Confederate heroes.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: While compromises with confederates in the mid-nineteenth century may have been necessary to to preserve a fragile peace, the combatants have long since passed on and that motivation, preservation of a fragile peace after The Civil War, is no longer necessary.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.1.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.1.2. Con: It was not an official document signed by both parts
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.2. Con: Lincoln's efforts to pardon and celebrate the South only "healed wounds" for white people. To the former slaves and non-white citizens of the US, this did not "heal" anything. By enabling the South to avoid confronting its own injustice, he made the wounds wider and more lasting, which is why we're still dealing with this issue today.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.2.1. Pro: Germany, for example, no longer struggles with its past because it has admitted its atrocities and repudiated them utterly. The US has failed to swallow the same medicine.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.2.1.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Germany continues to struggle with its past, and its overreaction to its previous crimes have created the key vulnerabilities that have enabled recent decline in public safety and security. Declining public safety has been shown as a leading indicator toward financial decline \(as increased risks drive away investment\) and these recent trends threatens to undermine Germany's position of strength within the EU.

This would not make Germany's actions a good example to follow.
[DoS report on Berlin](https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=21371)
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.2.2. Con: If Lincoln had tried to force the South to admit the wrongs of slavery or failed to make good-will gestures towards them, he would have only inspired further backlash. By freeing the slaves and healing divisions, he paved the way for the South to gradually become less racist to the point where their descendents now recognise that slavery is abhorrent. Although we still have a way to go towards full reconciliation between races, we are in a better position thanks to Lincoln.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.3. Pro: Many today may not know that this is true. The existence of the controversy should fuel education, not retribution.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.4. Con: Lincoln's actions were taken in the context of sharing a country with hundreds of thousands of former Confederates who had to be \(re-\)integrated into a joint society. This is not the case today.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.4.1. Pro: The efforts to pardon citizens of the South at the time were a method of necessary political and social compromise. More than a hundred years later we do not need to compromise with the Confederacy and should not memorialize them.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.1.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.5. Con: General Robert E. Lee stated that he was opposed to memorializing the CSA. It is and was inappropriate to establish these Statues in the first place as the represent those who fought for Slavery, its practice and its preservation.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.5.2. Pro: Robert E. Lee himself stated that the Confederate Battle [Flag](http://www.businessinsider.com/robert-e-lee-opposed-confederate-monuments-2017-8) belonged in a museum, and [refused](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/16/us/robert-e-lee-statues-letters-trnd/index.html) to allow Confederate symbols to be displayed in his presence for the rest of his life. Going by his writing, Lee himself would be appalled both by the Confederate monuments and by the modern support for them.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.5.2.1. Con: Lee did not oppose Confederate symbols because he thought the Confederacy was wrong, but because he did not want to inflame Union opinions against former members of the Confederacy. It is not a fair argument to use Lee's opposition to Confederate monuments in support of modern opposition to this monuments.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.5.2.2. Con: President Lincoln and General Lee were in tremendously different positions, but each were working towards the same goal, peace and reunification. Lincoln, the leader of the victors, urged his side to be gracious and generous to the other side, Lee, the military leader of the vanquished, urged his side to let go of the war and its symbols. The current thrust to 'tear down' monuments is the opposite of both, it is one 'side' tearing down the monuments of the other.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.5.2.2.1. Con: Removing the symbols of a wedge between two groups is a form of reunification, even if one of the groups would rather the wedge remain.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.5.2.2.1.1. Con: Removing symbols is a wedge between two groups. It is an act of aggression and violence, and if it is not at the will of the "other group," can only be seen as an attack.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.5.2.2.1.1.1. Con: If the removal by force is a wedge, it may still be replacing a much larger wedge issue with something more manageable.

Removal of a statue that one group thinks is part of their heritage may be easier to get over than a war another group believes was fought to own their ancestors as property.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.5.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.5.2.2.1.1.1.2. Con: The Civil War is over. The point of disagreement is not the war. It is whether those who participated on the losing side have a right to be represented in public works of art.
1.1.10.1.6.2.1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.5.2.
1.1.10.1.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.1.10.1.6.2.3. Con: The Confederacy declared itself independent of the United States.
1.1.10.1.6.2.3.1. Con: And the faction of the United States that supported forcible reintegration with the Southern states referred to itself as "the Union."
1.1.10.1.6.2.3.1.1. Con: The Union is what states that were not trying to leave were called. They did not form a new government or elect a new president. The Union was always the United States of America.
1.1.10.1.6.2.3.1.1.1. Con: The [Confederate States were reintegrated](http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Readmission+of+states) into the United States after they ceased attempting to press their claim of independence.
1.1.10.1.6.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: To be reintegrated implies that the two were once separated.
1.1.10.1.6.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: According to the Confederate declarations of secession for the period of the Civil War, they were separate.
1.1.10.1.6.2.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The United States [put conditions on former Confederate States to be readmitted to the Union.](http://www.ushistory.org/us/35.asp)

1.1.10.1.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.5.4.1.
1.1.10.1.7. Con: Conceding these monuments were put up to demonstrate dominance, does it not insult the memory of the victims in the Jim Crow Era to remove such stark reminders of the racism of years past. Symbolic meaning can change with time, but removing them aids only those who would rather the crimes of the past were forgotten.
1.1.10.1.8. Pro: As the majority of monuments were established not that long ago, the length of time they have been present is not sufficient justification to counterweight the societal pressures that caused them to be put up at all.
1.1.10.1.8.1. Con: This assumes the societal pressures that caused the monuments' erection had merit and were acceptable in that moment. An examination of the perspectives considered in which figures were memorialized shows immense bias. If African Americans were able to exercise their rights, their votes, or their voice, these monuments wouldn't have been erected in the first place.
1.1.10.1.9. Pro: It is crucial to understand the timing of the appearance of these monuments - their historical context, especially in the South where Reconstruction gave rise to Jim Crow laws, lynchings, and "Birth of a Nation".
1.1.10.1.9.1. Pro: Erecting monuments that commemorate individuals who fought to maintain a slavery-based economic system at a time when blacks were "free" and seeking integration into society served as a reminder of where whites believed they belonged. ["The Shifting History of Confederate Monuments"](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/shifting-history-confederate-monuments/)
1.1.10.1.9.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.
1.1.10.1.10. Pro: After black students in Virginia protested the segregated education system, the [Supreme Court ruled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_\(1954%E2%80%931968\)#Brown_v._Board_of_Education.2C_1954) in 1954 that state laws that allowed segregation were unconstitutional. This ruling marks the beginning of a long movement in which African-Americans fought to acquire equal [civil rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_\(1954%E2%80%931968\)#Brown_v._Board_of_Education.2C_1954) in all aspects of society.
1.1.10.1.11. Pro: There are those who are in power, such as those in power who were found guilty of conspiracy murder in the [Martin Luther King Jr. Conspiracy Murder Trial](http://www.thekingcenter.org/sites/default/files/KING%20FAMILY%20TRIAL%20TRANSCRIPT.pdf), who profit from divisions such as racial divisions, and these criminals \(in government\) [profit handsomely](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1569483) when they [incite violence under the color of law](http://www.wnd.com/2017/08/the-lefts-agents-provocateur/).
1.1.10.2. Con: For these memorials to act as effective "tools of oppression", would require those oppressed to recognize the power of these statues and then submit. There is no evidence that the people thought of as being oppressed actually find these monuments oppressive, and it's generally insulting to imply that people are dominated by statues over and above their own sense of worth and agency.
1.1.10.2.1. Pro: There is evidence that people who are thought of as oppressed find these statues [oppressive](http://www.meadvilletribune.com/opinion/columns/column-confederate-monuments-are-about-oppression-not-history/article_ed106956-838a-11e7-b3ab-778eaffd0767.html) \[[also](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/08/16/the-whole-point-of-confederate-monuments-is-to-celebrate-white-supremacy/)\]. It also does not undermine their agency to find oppressive statues that either do or are perceived as celebrating figures who in the past *did* try to undermine their agency, autonomy, and personhood. Agency is among other things the capacity for self-determination, to make choices, and to have causal efficacy. These statues can justifiably be seen as oppressive without undermining one's agency.
1.1.10.3. Con: The distinction between "representative" and "tool" is entirely time-sensitive. The implication is that People of Color currently living in the US have a window into the past effect of these monuments. Even if a Person of Color has been told by ancestors that these monuments exist for the express purpose of oppression, these monuments no longer exist within that context.
1.1.11. Con: If we happen to slide down this slippery slope, there's nothing stopping us from climbing back up. It doesn't take that long to make a statue.
1.1.11.1. Con: That may not necessarily be the case. Maybe many people simply want to record history in other ways. Maybe those who want to take down statues are more adamant about learning about history, slavery and the civil war than those who do not.
1.1.12. Con: 'Eradication' is not equatable to removal, renaming, and/or otherwise changing the presented context of these memorials and monuments. They will still exist, just not in the same form/context they currently do.
1.1.12.1. Pro: Constant redefinition of memorials allows for an evaluation of a country's past without removing them. In [post-Soviet Russia](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8306.00303/abstract), for example, the political dialogue over monuments like the Lenin Mausoleum allowed for a new interpretation to emerge that is representative for Russia today.
1.1.12.2. Pro: Balance is key. There are over 1,500 monuments to the Confederacy, plaques and place names, in the US. We can remove 1,000 or so \(or move them to museums\) and keep about 500 for historical reference. There are now too many. We should not, by quantity, appear to glorify, but neither should we erase the past.[time.com](http://time.com/4904679/confederate-monument-removal/)
1.1.12.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.
1.1.12.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.
1.1.12.2.3. Con: Removing symbols and glorifications does not "erase the past."
1.1.13. Pro: Many of the Confederate statutes are statutes of men; complex men with complex backgrounds who added ideas and actions to our nation - some beautiful and some horrible. Martin Luther King seemed to have rather discriminatory views on [LGBT](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/07/13/here-is-what-martin-luther-king-told-a-teen-struggling-with-his-sexuality/) people, yet no one would ask for the removal of his monument. Statues like his aren't there because the people they represent were perfect.
1.1.13.1. Con: Martin Luther King was not revered by these views nor were his monuments erected because of these ideas but for his fight for the Civil Rights of African-Americans. Confederates are honoured and depicted in monuments due to their fight to maintain slavery and oppression.
1.1.14. Con: It's not yet clear that those who support removing Confederate monuments are in the minority; it could very well be that the vocal minority is the pro-Confederate contingent.
1.1.15. Con: It's only a slippery slope if you consider confronting the demons of American history a tumble you'd like to avoid. Cognizance of our missteps is needed to avoid retaking them. We can acknowledge the sins and imperfections of our antecedents without deriding them outright as sinful and imperfect. Those sins and imperfections should still be eradicated from our society. The statues themselves belong in a museum where their context can be clarified and their perpetuation of racial divide abated.
1.1.16. Pro: Where would it end? Could not the Native American's make a claim that things such as the Washington Monument, should be taken down. Not because he was a slave owner, but because colonial Americans displaced and oppressed the Native Americans. Even if you argue you are honoring an idea, rather than a person, the Native Americans would not claim the idea of a 'New World' was such a good thing.
1.1.16.1. Con: The point about questioning Washington monuments is valid; so much so, that it supports the idea that such a slippery slope may be necessary. The assumption in the statement is that a review of Washington's status is off-limits.
1.1.17. Con: Taking down monuments that honor individuals and the cause they support does not erase history, as no ones is suggesting slavery, secession,  and the Civil War should no longer be taught in US History classes. The heritage and history of Southerners can be respected, but respect isn't the same thing as nostalgia for the Confederacy.
1.1.17.1. Pro: Similarly, no respectable historian lionizes Hitler or denies the Holocaust, but that doesn't mean it is okay to view all Germans as evil.
1.1.18. Pro: It is difficult to draw a line that satisfies everybody. If Confederate monuments are removed, statues of Presidents like Jefferson and Washington, who owned slaves, could be next.

1.1.18.3. Con: If removing Confederate monuments is a slippery slope leading to the removal of all colonial era monuments, fine. Take them all down. We should be honoring ideas, not people. Making heroes of people will always lead to disappointment, because no one is perfect. In this way, we can celebrate our ideals while acknowledging our flaws.
1.1.18.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.
1.1.18.3.2. Con: Context is vital in estimating the appropriateness of any particular monument. They should be considered in the context of the time they were erected.
1.1.18.3.2.1. Pro: All works should be considered in the [historical context](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-historical-context-1857069) and time they were created in and about.
1.1.18.3.2.1.1. Con: This is not a problem because judgments are being made on actions that were just as unethical and blameworthy in the past. Slavery, for example, has never been ethically justifiable.
1.1.18.3.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.1.18.4. Con: There is a difference between acknowledging the existence of history and honoring it.
1.1.18.5. Con: But what we associate with the early presidents is not their support for the slave trade, but rather the foundation of America. The only thing that we associate with people like Stonewall Jackson is attempted destruction of the United States and slavery.
1.1.18.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.1.18.5.2. Con: This claim is a major assumption of motive, one cannot possibly assume to know all the reasons someone else respects a historical figure. There are many admirable qualities found in many who fought for the Confederacy.
1.1.18.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.13.
1.1.18.5.2.2. Pro: The idea that Lee fought for slavery and therefore all his good qualities either did not exist or at least should not be recognized is an oversimplification and propagandizing of history. [There is much about Robert E. Lee](https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/robert-e-lee) [that is praiseworthy.](https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Robert_E._Lee)
1.1.18.5.2.2.1. Pro: Robert E. Lee is remembered for his sense of honor and duty. [In fact](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/making-sense-of-robert-e-lee-85017563/), he was not a staunch supporter of slavery or secession but fought for these ideas because they had been more or less democratically decided upon.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: Robert E. Lee was honorable.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: "Never do a wrong thing to make a friend or keep one." –[Robert E. Lee](https://www.biography.com/people/robert-e-lee-9377163)
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Robert E. Lee placed second in his West Point Military Academy graduating class after four spotless years without a demerit, and wrapped up his studies with perfect scores in artillery, infantry and cavalry. [biography.com](https://www.biography.com/people/robert-e-lee-9377163)
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con: None of these admittedly fine accomplishments is specifically indicative of honor.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: Robert E. Lee is broadly respected for his character and traits.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: [President Eisenhower said](https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2011/julyaugust/feature/how-did-robert-e-lee-become-american-icon) about Lee, "in my estimation, one of the supremely gifted men produced by our Nation… selfless almost to a fault…noble as a leader and as a man, and unsullied as I read the pages of our history. A nation of men of Lee’s caliber would be unconquerable in spirit and soul. Indeed, to the degree that present-day American youth will strive to emulate his rare qualities… we, in our own time of danger in a divided world, will be strengthened and our love of freedom sustained."
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: [Theodore Roosevelt pronounced Lee](https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2011/julyaugust/feature/how-did-robert-e-lee-become-american-icon) as “the very greatest of all the great captains that the English-speaking peoples have brought forth,” and declared that his dignified acceptance of defeat helped “build the wonderful and mighty triumph of our national life, in which all his countrymen, north and south, share.”
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.1.3.3. Con: If one of the things Robert E Lee stood for is the oppression, pain and slavery of people who are - today - American citizens, it doesn't really matter how well respected his character was.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Robert E Lee's statue still sends a clear discriminatory message - and notably, those who hate non-white Americans are some of the loudest voices defending it.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.1.3.3.2. Pro: Supporting American citizens who are still, today, being hurt by racism and prejudice is more important than any judgement of Lee's past character.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.2. Con: "...he fought for those ideas because they were more or less democratically voted upon."  This gets dangerously close to the Nazi defense at Nuremburg \[[reference](https://www.ushmm.org/outreach/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007722), [analysis](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/how-the-nazis-defense-of-just-following-orders-plays-out-in-the-mind/)\].
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.2.1. Con: This is an ad hominem \(either guilt by association or poisoning the well\). The fact that the Nazis used a similar defense does not make any statement about the defense or R.E.L. It would be like saying: "Nazis filed paperwork in service to the Reich, which is dangerously close to what many Americans do today..."
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.3. Con: Lee's exceedingly mild opposition to slavery was based on the notion that it was bad for the slave masters -- he held that it was good for blacks.  [fair-use.org](http://fair-use.org/robert-e-lee/letter-to-his-wife-on-slavery)
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.10.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.4. Con: This testimony from one of his slaves really says all that needs to be said: "Gen. Lee, in the meantime, stood by, and frequently enjoined Williams to lay it on well, an injunction which he did not fail to heed; not satisfied with simply lacerating our naked flesh, Gen. Lee then ordered the overseer to thoroughly wash our backs with brine, which was done." [fair-use.org](http://fair-use.org/wesley-norris/testimony-of-wesley-norris)
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.5. Con: Secession itself was a rebellion against democratic outcomes at the federal level, thus belying the claim that Lee fought for democratic rule.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.5.1. Con: [A majority of the people in Confederate states supported secession at the time, thus secession was democratic.](http://ehistory.osu.edu/articles/states-which-seceded)
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.6. Con: The democratic process in this case is undermined by the fact that in the Confederate South only white males were allowed to participate.  Slaves and even free blacks were not considered a part of the polis.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.6.1. Con: The North did not allow blacks to vote either.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.6.3. Con: Blacks fought for the Confederacy.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.6.3.1. Con: There is no [credible](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/10/another-black-confederate-debunking/247524/) [evidence](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-myth-of-the-black-confederate-soldier) that Black Americans fought for the confederacy.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: In opposing the very late effort of Robert E. Lee to enlist Black soldiers, Confederate leader [Howell Cobb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howell_Cobb#American_Civil_War) articulated a common view that "You cannot make soldiers of slaves, or slaves of soldiers. The day you make a soldier of them is the beginning of the end of the Revolution. And if slaves seem good soldiers, then our whole theory of slavery is wrong.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.6.3.1.2. Pro: It was not until March 1865, one month before Lee surrendered, that the Confederacy [authorized](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-myth-of-the-black-confederate-soldier) the enlistment of black soldiers. Even assuming that many enlisted \(of which there is no substantiated evidence\), there would have been no time for training.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.6.3.1.3. Pro: One of the most commonly cited texts for evidence of black confederate soldiers is Joy Masoff's "Our Virginia Past and Present." But the publisher has since [retracted](http://genprogress.org/voices/2010/10/27/15917/virginia-textbook-makes-false-claims-about-slaves-fighting-for-the-con/) this claim. Indeed, Masoff herself [admitted](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-myth-of-the-black-confederate-soldier) that her "evidence" was simply other links on the internet, not actual primary records.
1.1.18.5.2.2.1.6.3.1.4. Pro: One of the most common photos used as "evidence" of Black Confederate soldiers has been [shown](http://people.virginia.edu/~jh3v/retouchinghistory/essay.html) to be a \(recently\) doctored photo of Union soldiers.

1.1.18.5.2.2.4. Pro: Robert E. Lee [refused to make money from his name during reconstruction](https://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/clyde-wilson-library/robert-e-lee-and-the-american-union/).
1.1.18.5.2.2.5. Pro: Robert E. Lee was weary of war and no longer wanted to fight until he felt compelled to defend his homeland.
1.1.18.5.2.2.5.1. Pro: "What a cruel thing is war: to separate and destroy families and friends, and mar the purest joys and happiness God has granted us in this world; to fill our hearts with hatred instead of love for our neighbors, and to devastate the fair face of this beautiful world." –[Robert E.

1.1.18.5.2.2.9. Pro: Robert E. Lee was accomplished and distinguished.
1.1.18.5.2.2.9.1. Pro: [Robert E. Lee served with distinction in the Mexican-American war](https://www.thoughtco.com/generals-who-served-mexican-american-war-2136198), including the [battles of Veracruz, Churubusco, and Chapultepec](https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/robert-e-lee). General Scott declared him to be “the very best soldier that I ever saw in the field.”
1.1.18.5.2.2.9.2. Pro: In the Civil War, Robert E. Lee and his army achieved great success during the Peninsula Campaign and at Second Bull Run and Fredericksburg, with his greatest victory coming in the bloody Battle of Chancellorsville. [history.com](https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/robert-e-lee)
1.1.18.5.2.2.9.3. Pro: At the start of the Civil War, [President Abraham Lincoln offered Robert E. Lee command of the United States Army](https://civilwar150th.blogspot.com/2011/04/lincoln-offers-lee-command.html).
1.1.18.5.2.2.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.5.2.2.1.1.2.
1.1.18.5.2.2.10. Con: The statues in question do not honor him for his great character, they honor him for leading the confederacy.
1.1.18.6. Pro: It is difficult to put a limit on these removals. For example, there were three streets in [Florida](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/08/30/florida-city-votes-to-strip-confederate-names-from-streets.html) named "Lee" "Forest" and "Hood" and the names were changed because these were all Confederate Generals. That cost [money and time](http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/hollywood/fl-sb-street-names-hollywood-address-change-20170927-story.html) to many citizens living on those streets. Money that the city did not compensate them for.
1.1.18.7. Pro: The founding fathers were clearly racist. They thought only "white men of good character" should become citizens. It's not hard to find suggestions of blowing up [Mount Rushmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rushmore) based on this.
1.1.18.8. Pro: People today are focused on and interpreting the statues as honoring slavery and white superiority. When the monuments were built, the intention was to honor the dedication of the soldiers, not a political cause or issue of the time.
1.1.18.8.1. Con: Research into when Confederate monuments were actually built suggests otherwise. [www.splcenter.org](https://www.splcenter.org/20160421/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy)
1.1.18.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.2.2.

1.1.18.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.2.
1.1.18.10. Con: This is a slippery slope fallacy.  We are discussing a specific group of men who are remembered for one thing: fighting a bloody war against the government of the United States to defend slavery.  Certainly other historical figures owned slaves, but this is not the only reason we remember them, and it is certainly not why we honor them.
1.1.18.10.1. Con: This is not a slippery slope fallacy. A slippery slope fallacy happens when "a party asserts that a relatively small first step leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant \(usually negative\) effect."

Removing one monument is an action that could easily expand to other monuments with similar traits.
1.1.18.10.1.1. Con: The slippery slope is not always a fallacy. If you can prove the slope is real, it is a valid logical tool.

But correlation doesn't prove causation, and just because the subjects of the aforementioned symbols all owned slaves does not prove that there is a significant risk. By that logic, we could say that removing confederate monuments could easily expand to removing all guard rails, because they too are fixed metal objects deliberately put in public spaces.
1.1.18.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.18.10.3. Con: Men fighting a bloody war against the government of the United States to defend slavery may be how some remember them, but the controversy exists because there is broad disagreement among others who do not remember them this way.
1.1.18.10.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.1.18.10.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.5.2.2.5.
1.1.19. Pro: Slavery has been a part of almost every culture's [past](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/slavery/ethics/intro_1.shtml). Establishing a clear line on what is acceptable in history is difficult as both sides always have positive and bad elements on their legacies.
1.1.19.1. Pro: Ancient [Greek](http://www.greeka.com/greece-history/monuments/) and [Roman](http://www.greeka.com/greece-history/monuments/) monuments that many tourists visit everyday should therefore not be opened to the public as those civilizations supported [slavery](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/slavery/ethics/intro_1.shtml).
1.1.19.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.
1.1.19.1.2. Con: This is a red herring fallacy. The debate is about removing statues honoring men who fought against our government, who brought great suffering and death to a generation in the defense of slavery in our country. This is not a debate about displaying artifacts from civilizations that died 2000 years ago.
1.1.19.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.1.19.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.1.19.2. Pro: Aristotle, Plato and Homer are among philosophers who [justified](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/slavery/ethics/philosophers_1.shtml) and condoned slavery, yet their contributions to humanity are not appreciated any less.
1.1.19.2.1. Con: Plato, Aristotle, and Homer not are remembered for any defense they might have offered of slavery. They are remembered for enduring cultural and philosophical contributions. Confederates, conversely, are only remembered for treason in the defense of slavery.
1.1.19.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.

1.1.19.2.1.4. Con: It's fascinating what people choose to forget and to remember. It's almost as if it's entirely subjective and capricious.
1.1.19.3. Pro: Religious texts in [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_slavery) and other major faiths all recognize slavery, yet the scriptures and principles are still honored and followed today.
1.1.19.3.1. Con: Religious monuments have often been removed from public land.
1.1.19.3.2. Con: If the scriptures only offered a defense of slavery, they would not be honored.
1.1.19.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.1.19.3.2.2. Pro: We revere such scriptures in spite of their tolerance for slavery because they offer much more than that.
1.1.19.3.2.2.1. Pro: Indeed, the Bible has also frequently been used to [critique](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23328492?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) slavery.
1.1.19.4. Con: Monuments should only exist to things that are pillars of a culture. Since slavery is no longer a pillar of our culture, representations to those who fought for slavery should be torn down.

1.1.19.5. Con: This is a red herring.  We are not talking about all cultures; we are talking about our culture.  We are not talking about anyone else; we are talking about Americans.  And we are asking whether it is acceptable to maintain monuments honoring people whose only claim to fame is that they fought a bloody and treasonous war to defend slavery.
1.1.19.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.1.19.5.2. Con: Memorials and other artifacts embody and represent Southern values and culture.
1.1.19.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.4.2.
1.1.19.5.2.2. Pro: Some confederate monuments have legitimate reasons \(unity, duty, reparations\) to be revered and should be kept in place based on an open and honest historical review of their original purpose and dedication details. For example, the [Arlington Confederate Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_Memorial_\(Arlington_National_Cemetery\)).
1.1.19.5.2.2.1. Con: The sculptor of the Arlington Confederate Memorial wanted to "rewrite history 'correctly'... to depict black slaves' support for the confederate cause." \([Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Confederate_Memorial_\(Arlington_National_Cemetery\)#/32_figures_on_the_mount)\). This is akin to making a stature that depicts Jews in support of Nazis. Sure, it happened; but it was such a small percentage of the population that to depict it as the sentiment of a group is revisionist and wholly removed from legitimate reasons \(i.e., duty, reparations, and even truth\).
1.1.19.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.1.19.5.2.4. Pro: [Confederate flags and monuments are symbols of solidarity to rural working-class americans](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/views-of-the-confederate-flag-have-softened-since-the-charleston-shooting_us_5994b06ee4b0acc593e4dd48). Many of them feel forgotten as globalization has reduced opportunities for rural blue-collar life. Tearing down monuments sends a message that the country wants to forget them altogether.
1.1.19.5.2.4.1. Con: They are unrelated. Confederate monuments celebrate a wealthy slave-owning class that had very little to do with poor working-class rural Americans.
1.1.19.5.2.4.1.1. Con: Populist leaders are often wealthy and can still unite the poor and middle classes around a message.
1.1.19.5.2.4.2. Con: The Nazi flag unified the down trodden working class German. The Sickle and Hammer was a symbol of the worker in the Soviet Union. Once values changed, these were removed and moved to museums.
1.1.19.5.2.4.2.1. Con: [Hammer and sickle monuments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_and_Kolkhoz_Woman) still stand in Russia.
1.1.19.5.2.4.2.2. Con: Adolf Hitler requested that no statues be placed of him during the Third Reich in Germany, so there were none to take down.
1.1.19.5.2.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.2.1.
1.1.19.5.2.4.2.4. Pro: Monuments should be preserved as something we learned from not something we celebrate. For example, a [museum in Utah](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865687364/Op-ed-A-small-Utah-towns-insightful-response-to-the-monument-controversy.html) has a portrait of Stalin and a collection of Soviet Art. But, they are displayed in context so that we can learn from the past. This is a constructive approach to our history.
1.1.19.5.2.4.3. Con: Those things may be symbols of solidarity to *some* rural working-class Americans, but certainly not all.
1.1.19.5.2.4.3.1. Con: Symbols of solidarity rarely include all members of a society.
1.1.19.5.2.4.4. Con: Globalization was not a factor in the motivations for the war. It was not mentioned, nor implied in any confederate constitution. There was no such thing as rural blue-collar as agriculture was confined primarily to slavery. Slaves made up nearly 40% of the entire population \(black and white\) of the South.
1.1.19.5.2.4.5. Con: If a monument portrays the struggle of working-class Americans, it may be a symbol of solidarity, but the monuments in question are generally celebrations of powerful wealthy individuals who fought to perpetuate slavery. Moving them to museums is not an affront to blue-collar workers, and keeping them in place does not benefit present day struggling people in any way.

1.1.19.5.2.4.6. Con: The claim of solidarity with working-class Americans downplays the ethnic divide present in the data. [Black Americans are 32 percentage points likelier to see the Confederate Flag as a racist symbol.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/views-of-the-confederate-flag-have-softened-since-the-charleston-shooting_us_5994b06ee4b0acc593e4dd48)
1.1.19.5.2.4.7. Pro: It is possible that a so-called "whitelash" led white working-class voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania to throw their electoral votes to Trump. If this, rather than Russian interference in the election, best explains Clinton's loss in 2016, removing monuments might harm the progressive cause by helping Trump win re-election in 2020.
1.1.19.5.2.4.7.1. Con: Standing up for the right thing means accepting that there will be resistance to the implementation. The backlash is a separate issue.
1.1.19.5.2.4.7.1.1. Con: In formal debate, the argument that a proposal may create new harms that are even worse than the original harms is always relevant.
1.1.19.5.2.4.7.2. Con: This is not a reason the monuments should be kept or destroyed. Every action has political consequences. That in itself should not be a reason to argue for or against the validity of an action. e.g.- if ISIS threatens retribution based on an action or absence of an action, is that a valid reason to do or not to do something?
1.1.19.5.2.5. Con: This may be true of Southern white culture but not Southern culture as a whole. The values of the black citizens were ignored when these statues were erected, mostly long after the war ended.

1.1.19.5.4. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.1.19.5.5. Con: In every controversial issue, there are at least two views that could be considered valid. Instead of the one group removing an unpopular view, they are free to express their competing views.
1.1.19.5.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.1.19.5.5.2. Pro: Free speech means everyone speaks, not that some are silenced by others who disagree.
1.1.19.5.5.2.1. Con: Free speech means that everybody has the right to express their opinions. It does not mean that everybody's opinions should be validated, nor does it mean that people cannot counter other's opinions. If erecting the statues constitutes free speech, removing them also constitutes free speech.
1.1.19.5.5.2.1.1. Con: No one is keeping anyone from stating that the statues should be removed. No one is keeping anyone from building new statues to "balance the presentation."

Removal of speech/monuments from the public square because some are offended is precisely the silencing of speech, the exact opposite of the First Amendment.
1.1.19.5.5.2.1.1.1. Con: The First Amendment protects the right of a city to erect a monument, just as it protects its right to remove one. No law is being made to abridge the right of a city to erect/remove monuments, so no violation of the First Amendment exists.
1.1.19.5.5.2.1.1.2. Con: Speech and monuments are not the same thing.
1.1.19.5.5.2.2. Con: The Memorial, flags and monuments discussed are in public places, not on private property. Therefore it is not about individuals' right to erect monuments but about the community's \(i.e., the government's\) right to erect monuments.
1.1.19.5.5.2.2.1. Pro: Just as individuals can speak fondly of Hitler but the government ought not to, so can individuals erect confederate monuments, but the government ought not to.
1.1.19.5.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.2.1.2.1.4.
1.1.19.5.6. Con: -> See 1.1.18.10.3.
1.2. Con: The power to take down statues also is the power to control history and thus, to [control the future](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6145-who-controls-the-past-controls-the-future-who-controls-the). This power lends itself to being employed in the service of political agendas, rather than the good of society, and should be used as sparingly as possible
1.2.1. Pro: Following the logic visible here, many other monuments and statues that represent evils of the past would also have to be removed. Yet this is not up for debate.
1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.2.1.2. Con: The US Military removed statues of Saddam Husein during the US occupation of Iraq, and I am quite certain the same is true of Adolf Hitler during World War II. Watching these monuments fall, I do not think anyone hesitated to think 'these monuments of terrible men should be preserved for history's sake'.
1.2.1.3. Con: It's not just about removing monuments that represent evils of the past, but removing monuments that honor evils of the past. The confederacy was a failed rebellion that tried to establish states' right to enslave other humans.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: These monuments don't represent the evils of the past, they represent the accomplishments of the people in our country who fought for their current understanding of freedom and liberty.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.
1.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2.1.3.3. Con: Memorials are erected to honor individuals and the events surrounding them, and are usually erected in the locations in which those events took place. They do not honor ideologies. Ideological spin is what we impart, or project, onto statues, after the fact.
1.2.1.3.3.1. Con: Ideologies are depicted by statues throughout time and around the world, for example,  the Tomb of the [Unknown Soldier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Unknown_Soldier), [The Statue of Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty) or the [Holocaust Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe), not to mention [crosses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_the_King_\(%C5%9Awiebodzin\)) or other religious symbols. Confederate statues do the same.
1.2.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: The ideologies of the Statue of Liberty or the Holocaust Memorial are in keeping with our current values and worth promoting.  The ideology represented by the Confederate monuments is both vile and treasonous; there is no reason to proclaim it.
1.2.1.3.3.2. Con: These contextual icons are only relevant because of their ideologies. There is nothing inherently just about war. The context of the fight is what matters, not how valiantly their side fought.
1.2.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: If the civil war and their ideals would have never been fought over, those immortalized by the statues would not be remembered.
1.2.1.3.3.2.2. Pro: Ideology is often behind the erection of monuments. There is a distinction between history and memory. History is about past events as is often best reflected in a museum. But memory is about how our representation of past events informs our present and future. Monuments are typically erected to serve memory and not history.
1.2.1.3.3.3. Pro: The ideology modern society imparts on a monument is only a projection of modern mentalities, and at some other point in the future, the perspective may shift yet again.
1.2.1.3.3.3.1. Con: The intent of the people who made and placed the monument can be factored into its ideology.
1.2.1.3.3.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.1.
1.2.1.3.3.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.3.
1.2.1.3.3.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.19.5.2.
1.2.1.3.3.4. Con: The clashes over these memorials are strongly ideological, the defenders of them specifically defend the ideology.
1.2.1.3.3.5. Con: The construction of these memorials are done to put forward ideologies. For example the individuals are posed heroically, with positive messages.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1. Con: Monuments do not signify the enduring morality of the subject, but celebrate an aspect of their character within the context. Sometimes monuments celebrate nothing except a person's importance to history, good or bad.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1. Pro: Presidents Jefferson and Washington would not be considered good people by today's standards. Very few people celebrate them for committing crimes and faux pas which had yet to be invented.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1. Con: The standards of the days of the civil war were understood by the people living in the time. Freedom was for all men. It was debatable leading up to the civil war, but the context was just that: Debatable. The South took up arms to justify their position. All warring factions may think they are justified, but its unreasonable to maintain a legacy in statue when the country and the constitution knew they were wrong.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1.1. Con: It is unjust to remove public references to and broadly condemn people who were admired from history, who played important roles or were champions to many in the nation, that had some beliefs or stances that are unpopular today. The contributions of figures from history should be evaluated and taught about in the context of the common beliefs of their time where they lived, and how and why those beliefs may be different from popular beliefs today.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The aspect of their character that over-shadows any other aspect is their commitment to slavery since it was central to everything else that they are known for.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This is a logical fallacy- [argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum).
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Argumentum ad populum refers to appealing to broadly held but false beliefs as a way to assert the truth of those beliefs \(i.e. most people believe Earth is flat, so it must be\). This discussion is about people's experience of public spaces and symbolism as the fact itself, not as a way of establishing some other information.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.2.2.3.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.18.5.2.2.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Many terrible people from history are revered by some people.  We don't put statues to them in public spaces.  The contributions \(both positive and negative\) of these people are taught in context in classrooms.  Statuary isn't educational and certainly isn't contextual, it's reverential.  We do not need public celebration of people who did more than anybody in history to literally destroy the United States of America.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.1.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.4.

1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Slavery was legal during the Civil War, both before it began, and even after the Emancipation Proclamation which had no authority while the Confederate States were claiming to be separate, nor did it stop slavery within the Northern States.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.2. Con: While both Jefferson and Washington were certainly flawed, they are publicly memorialized specifically for their representation of ideals that are considered good by today's standards. Whereas, despite the likelihood that various members of the Confederacy had some redeeming qualities, they were memorialized for their participation in and defense of heinous beliefs and acts.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.3. Con: The idea that we should stop memorializing some people, as then we'd need to stop memorializing others, assumes not memorializing those others would be a mistake, but there's no reason why. It is necessary to understand the exact reasons and maybe to reevaluate the founding fathers or other important figures. Maybe we need to change who we admire.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.2. Con: Monuments can convey a lot of nuance, based on the specifics of their context. A statue outside a courthouse suggests a connection to justice. In a park imposes an idea onto public space. The precise contexts of these statues, not just their broadest possible meaning, are part of the experience they create and part of the conversation about their meaning.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.5. Con: If monuments were based on historical importance, every major city in Europe would have a statue of Adolf Hitler.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.6. Con: The aspect of character within the context is defined by the morality of the subject.
1.2.1.3.3.5.1.7. Con: You fail to consider why the enduring victims shouldn't have greater say on how their plight is memorialized. If character within context is going to be examined in monuments, allow everyone, not just those in power at the time, to have a say in how to remember the past as a union of multiple perspectives. Many of these monuments ignore African Americans' contemporary perspectives. Not saying or not pairing them with new ones adding perspective omits and discounts AAs' side of the Confederacy.

1.2.1.3.3.5.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.3.
1.2.1.3.3.5.4. Pro: For example the dedication of Hood's Texas brigade monument included statements about the inferiority of black people. [books.google.co.uk](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QmMGAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=mcneel+marble+company&source=bl&ots=AtXj3umIjA&sig=gMHL-vIbWgYjpnEci5enUdBDD9Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwit1fS83NnVAhUJL1AKHX1FA8YQ6AEIUzAJ#v=onepage&q=inferior&f=false)
1.2.1.3.3.5.4.1. Con: A few examples is not representative of the over 1,500 Confederate monuments.
1.2.1.3.3.5.4.1.1. Con: Monuments that are supportive of the Confederacy's goals should be removed.
1.2.1.3.3.5.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.19.5.5.

1.2.1.3.3.5.5. Pro: The idea of the Lost Cause, that the confederacy was not about slavery, is inherently ideological, and is referenced or implied by most memorials.
1.2.1.3.3.5.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2.1.3.3.5.5.2. Con: The term "Lost Cause" was [originally coined by people in the South to describe the defense of their homes and livelihoods, their bid for independence, and the overwhelming military superiority of the North](https://thelostcauseky.blogspot.com/2010/11/found-lost-cause-its-origins-as-phrase.html). [After the war it became a euphemism for anything positive about the South and Confederacy in a derogatory way](https://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/clyde-wilson-library/nolans-myth-of-the-lost-cause/). Few dispute that the Civil War was at least partially about the concern around the potential economic impact and civil unrest caused by freeing millions of slaves at once.

1.2.1.3.3.5.5.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.9.3.
1.2.1.3.3.5.6. Pro: Monuments carry with them the connotation of honoring the thing depicted. Monuments to the tragic still honor some human aspect worth holding up as good. Regardless of words, a proud, towering statue implies this was something to be respected.
1.2.1.3.3.5.6.1. Pro: A tall plinth that makes the subject tower over the observer inherently places the subject in a position of moral superiority.
1.2.1.3.3.5.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.1.
1.2.1.3.3.5.6.1.2. Con: A plinth gives a monument visibility, but says nothing about the morality of the monument. Morality is a social construct which we place upon monuments.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7. Pro: A statue is not merely a reminder that history happened; it is a depiction of how we choose to remember it. Replacing the statues with new art that reflects current values shows that our values as a country have changed.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2. Con: It was the prerogative of our ancestors to commemorate  and honor the service of their fellow citizens in ways that were appropriate to them and their society at the time. Judging past actions through a present day social lens ignores their legacy and disrespects the realities that drove these historical acts.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1. Con: There is a long history of new societies tearing down the monuments of those who came before, especially when those values differed.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.4.2.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.3. Con: Free speech means we all may hear and see things we disagree with every day. In the United States we do not silence or remove those we disagree with, we use our free speech to oppose viewpoints we consider to be wrong.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.3.1. Pro: Free speech protects expressions that are considered controversial.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Removing things that conflict with "American Values" is a suppression of free speech.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The First Amendment gives cities the right of public expression \(i.e., erection and removal of statues\) at their discretion. It is not a mandate that all public expressions must be preserved forever.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: If a statue is erected and then removed to silence what it stood for, that is the suppression of free speech.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This implies that once an idea is democratically expressed that it cannot ever be changed or taken back without suppressing free speech. If this is the case, then Democracies regularly silence those who lose elections or movements whose laws are amended.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.3.1.1.1.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.3.1.3. Con: The United States Constitution protects freedom of speech in the public sphere only so long as the speech does not incite violence among the people. All monuments of the Confederacy, be they statues of Confederate leaders, or flags, are symbols that are inherently predicated on inciting  violence, therefore they are not protected speech and should be removed from the public sphere.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.4. Con: Those who work to remove or deface statues of former heroes and denounce them as symbols of racism or fascism might benefit from a reminder that the first thing the Nazis and Fascists did was  tear down monuments to past heroes and leaders with whom they did not agree. To do so is part of the very definition of fascism.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.4.1. Pro: [The Nazi Third Reich destroyed thousands of statues and monuments in Germany](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/01/25/47143/) and [foreign cities they conquered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Mickiewicz_Monument,_Krak%C3%B3w) and had them melted down.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.4.2. Con: This claim falsely equivocates two different situations. The movement to take down Confederate monuments is not being done by a powerful and oppressive military regime, instead it is a grassroots movement within individual communities. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the movement to take down monuments is a first action that will lead to fascism, or other kinds of oppression.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.2.1.1.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.4.4. Con: Heroes to whom exactly?  Were they heroes to the slaves they were trying desperately to keep enslaved?  Were they heroes to those northerners who were trying to create a more just world?  No, they were heroes to the re-constructionist south who were trying to force African Americans into second hand citizen status.   Why should we celebrate people who rebelled in the name of slavery?  Why do we think these people are worthy of statutes?  Not all history should be celebrated.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.2. Con: There has never been a time in history when more information about the past was as accessible to everyone. Removing a statue does not in any way affect the ability of anyone to learn about the tragedy of slavery or the complexity of the Civil War.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.2.1. Pro: History is learned through education and these monuments fail to educate the populace on the realities of slavery and the civil war.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.3. Con: Those citizens most negatively affected by these monuments often did not have ancestors amongst those who decided to erect these monuments.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.4. Pro: Historical revisionism attempts to erase generations of history in order to assuage present's day guilt.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.4.1. Con: The statues should go because they inaccurately represent American history as white and European: Europeans were only able to come to America because of the welcoming attitude of the First Nations, which they took advantage of. These statues stand in the same tradition of oppression.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.4.2. Con: Treating statues erected in the 1950s as symbols of opposition to civil-rights for blacks as if they were relics that date back to the Civil War is historical revisionism. Removing them is setting the record straight.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.4.2.1. Con: It is a fallacy to draw conclusions about the motivations from the time the statues went up alone. The spike in statues in the 1910s and 1960s may have landed during cultural responses to greater equality for black Americans, but those dates also align with the 50th and 100th anniversaries of the Civil War. For the same reason that many revolutionary statues were erected in the 1870s and 1880s, so too would Civil War statues be erected at the centennials.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Such an argument would only apply to monuments erected exactly in 1915 and 1965 avowedly for the purposes of anniversaries. Other monuments erected by pro Jim Crow regimes at other times attract no such a defence.

1.2.1.3.3.5.7.4.2. Pro: 'Every generation is appalled by the failings of previous generations.

1.2.1.3.3.5.7.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.4.4. Con: This is not necessarily the case. In this case, society has only recently become aware about the true consequences of slavery and systematic inequality.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.3.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.4.4.2. Con: By this same rationale, we might see a future movement demand removal of the Statue of Liberty as being nationalistic, racist, and jingoistic.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.4.5. Con: -> See 1.1.18.3.2.1.1.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.3.2.1.
1.2.1.3.3.5.7.5. Pro: For example, the meaning of a tall proud Robert E. Lee statue would be very different than the meaning of a defeated Robert E. Lee in shackles after the war ended.
1.2.1.3.3.6. Con: It is difficult to separate a man whose life work was in service of an ideology from the ideology he served.
1.2.1.3.3.6.1. Pro: If the statues are only bronze representations of a person tied to a historical event then there should be memorials to the hijackers at the 9/11 memorial. We don't do that because we acknowledge that ideologies are part of what we are memorializing about the person.
1.2.1.3.3.7. Con: The memorials were intended specifically to communicate support to racism rather than to commemorate Civil War events or individuals per se.
1.2.1.3.3.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.
1.2.1.3.3.8. Pro: There are an infinitude of ideologies and ideas surrounding any person or place throughout history. No one is a perfect exemplar of a human being. It makes no sense to judge one memorial by one ideology, and by modern moral standards, and much less to do it out of historical and social context, by people who barely understand the facts.
1.2.1.3.3.8.1. Pro: The Berlin Wall was once created as an act of division but its remains are looked upon as signs of unification today.
1.2.1.3.3.8.1.1. Con: The Berlin Wall has inherent historical significance. The Confederate monuments do not.
1.2.1.3.3.8.1.2. Con: The ruins are ruins, not treasured cultural icons represented as heroes.
1.2.1.3.3.8.2. Pro: Concentration camps turned into educational facilities, like [Dachau](http://www.kz-gedenkstaette-dachau.de/index-e.html), [Auschwitz](http://auschwitz.org/en/) or [Sachsenhausen](http://www.stiftung-bg.de/gums/en/).

1.2.1.3.3.8.3. Pro: The Government General building in central Seoul was erected by the Japanese to bring [modernity](https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520276550) to the northern, mainly Korean part of Seoul. Yet, in [1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_General_Government_Building,_Seoul) it was destroyed as symbol of oppression.
1.2.1.3.3.8.3.1. Con: And yet there are monuments to Vladimir Lenin, and Joseph Stalin standing in the United States uncontested.
1.2.1.3.3.8.3.1.1. Pro: Monuments of [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statues_of_Vladimir_Lenin#United_States) exist in the United States.
1.2.1.3.3.8.3.1.1.1. Con: Lenin [statues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statues_of_Vladimir_Lenin) in the US are not in any way comparable to Confederate memorials as there are only five and none of them is in public premises: two are in private hotels/casinos, one is in an apartment building, one belongs to an art gallery and the last one is for [sale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Lenin,_Seattle) and displayed outdoor a retail property.
1.2.1.3.3.8.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: As Lenin statues are on private premises and located there by their owners, their removal by any form of government would indeed be an attack to the [First Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment).
1.2.1.3.3.8.3.1.2. Pro: Monuments of [Joseph Stalin](http://www.chronicle.com/article/5-Minutes-With-an-Art/66127/) exist in the United States.
1.2.1.3.3.8.3.1.2.1. Con: That [statue](http://www.chronicle.com/article/5-Minutes-With-an-Art/66127/) is part of a bigger memorial, the [National D-Day Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_D-Day_Memorial), celebrating how Allied Armed Forces invaded Normandy during World War II to defeat the Nazis. Joseph Stalin and the government of the Soviet Union were at the time [allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) of the US, the UK and France, among other nations, against Hitler and Mussolini.
1.2.1.3.3.8.3.1.3. Con: The issue of slavery and those that fought to preserve it is a closer issue to many Americans than the evils committed by these men. As such it is understandable that their monuments may not yet have the same public outcry.
1.2.1.3.3.8.3.1.4. Con: The fact that there are monuments of leaders of communists regimes who committed atrocities may be a reason to also call for their removal, not an argument to keep Confederate memorials.
1.2.1.3.3.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.1.
1.2.1.3.3.8.5. Con: The issue is not that they were pro-slavery.  If it was, we would be talking about the Washington Monument as well.  The only thing Confederates did to be noteworthy is to shed blood for slavery's continued existence.
1.2.1.3.3.8.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2.1.3.3.8.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.18.10.3.
1.2.1.3.3.9. Con: Ignoring the personal ideologies of the people represented and looking at only their actions; we should not be honoring those who fought for the right to continue to enslave human beings for personal profit.
1.2.1.4. Con: The United Nations was set up as a body to discuss issues that expand beyond any one country's borders, which is why many places that represent evils of the past to some are designated as [UNESCO world heritage sites](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list) as they may be worth saving to others. Anything that expands beyond the US should be left out of this debate and deferred to the UN.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: Each state has sovereignty to determine its own path and its own monuments.
1.2.1.5. Con: Monuments to Stalin in Eastern Europe are comparable, and they are also being removed.
1.2.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.8.3.1.
1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.
1.2.3. Con: Applying today's moral values to yesterday's times is how we progress as a people and should be embraced as a patch to a society of better understanding and tolerance.
1.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.4.
1.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.18.3.2.1.
1.2.3.3. Con: Removing monuments promotes a dark, ["original sin" view](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-left-cant-let-go-of-racism-1503868512) of American history in which war is essentially an ideological battle of good and evil, and identification with Confederate ancestors makes one guilty of perpetrating systemic racism. This is a bad set of moral values to apply to statues.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.4.1.1.
1.2.3.3.2. Con: Identification with Confederate ancestors may not, by itself, make one guilty of perpetrating systemic racism.  But Southern American [racist groups](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/14/politics/charts-explain-us-hate-groups/index.html) are *overwhelmingly* likely to identify with Confederate ancestors.  It's not as simple as cause and effect - but it's not disconnected either. People who identify with - as oppose to merely acknowledge - Confederate ancestors are less likely to question their pro-slavery ideals.
1.2.3.3.3. Con: Wars are rarely "good and evil", but that doesn't mean there is never a right side and a wrong one.  The American Civil War is one of the very few historical conflicts where there is a clear moral wrong on one side, and that fact alone was the primary reason for the war.

To pretend that the Civil War had no moral dimension is a failure just as much as over-stating it would be.
1.2.4. Con: The monuments exist in the present, and so there is only a desire to apply today's moral standards to today's public art.
1.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.4.2.
1.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.4.
1.2.5. Con: We absolutely can apply yesterday's moral standards to yesterday's time. It wasn't socially acceptable to seek the destruction of the United States government even back then. That is what the war was about.
1.2.5.1. Con: The very existence of the United States following the American Revolution was seen by many contemporaries as validation of the so-called "[Right of Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_revolution)".
1.2.5.1.1. Con: The success of a revolution does not support the existence of the Right of Revolution.
1.2.5.1.2. Con: The right of revolution is circumscribed. The Declaration of Independence outlined when exactly a people are justified in rebelling against a sovereign government.  None of those conditions were met by the CSA.  The American example does does not confer legitimacy to Sourthern treason.
1.2.5.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.
1.2.6. Pro: Taking down memorials is politically motivated iconoclasm.
1.2.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.
1.2.6.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.2.6.3. Con: Slavery was by no means universally supported at the time. There were many people opposed to slavery at this time, and even earlier in history. This was debated during the drafting of the Constitution 1787, but the South threatened to not join the US at that time if slavery was abolished.
1.2.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2.6.4. Con: -> See 1.2.5.
1.2.6.5. Con: Iconoclasm isn't wrong if the beliefs should be attacked or the symbols shouldn't be venerated.
1.2.6.5.1. Con: Those who erected the memorial were the judges of the time.  Only those erecting a memorial can judge whether or not veneration is deserving. Their future generations cannot possibly appreciate in the same way.  Future generations will always see fault in history because they have hindsight bias, and no one in history is perfect.
1.2.6.5.1.1. Con: People can decide what is worth venerating at any time. There is no reason to limit when an idea or monument has overstayed its welcome.
1.2.6.5.1.1.1. Con: If not all members of a society agree with the removal of a statue, then a small minority should not be able to make that decision for all others and their ancestors.
1.2.6.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.4.
1.2.6.5.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.6.
1.2.6.5.1.1.1.3. Con: There are hardly any political decisions made in democracies that every single member of society agrees with - in fact, many are made by sizeable minorities.
1.2.6.5.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.6.5.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: Even a referendum like the one on Scottish independence in 2014, which had a [turnout of 85%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014) and a decisive victory for the no-side, saw only 46% of all registered voters supporting the result.
1.2.6.5.1.1.1.3.3. Pro: Ever since popular vote numbers have been recorded, [not a single](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_by_popular_vote_margin) US President received the support of more than 42% of eligible voters.
1.2.6.5.1.1.1.3.3.1. Con: Many people choose not to vote. This is their right.
1.2.6.5.1.1.2. Con: We might as well stop erecting monuments at all, as the only monuments people would want up are the ones that validate themselves and their own ideals. If values must be immediate national values then the purpose of a memorial is overlooked and erection of new statues is self-aggrandizement.
1.2.6.5.1.1.2.1. Con: The only monuments that people would want up would be ones that reflect the values of the nation. Monuments to the confederacy do not reflect the values of the nation.
1.2.6.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.1.
1.2.6.6. Pro: Taking down historical monuments because it doesn't suit your beliefs is an act of intolerance associated with the most barbaric regimes. True tolerance means accepting that people today and in the past have beliefs different from our own and looking for ways to address those dispassionately without having to accept them.
1.2.6.6.1. Con: As expressed by philosopher Karl Popper as “[the paradox of tolerance](https://medium.com/\@juliaserano/free-speech-and-the-paradox-of-tolerance-e0547aefe538)", allowing unlimited tolerance may end up erasing any form of tolerance. Therefore if tolerance is extended to those who are intolerant, society will become intolerant.
1.2.6.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.
1.2.6.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.2.6.9. Con: Putting the statues in a museum resolves the iconoclast argument
1.2.6.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.
1.2.6.9.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.
1.2.6.9.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.
1.2.6.10. Pro: Iconoclasm serves only the narrow interests of the activists engaged in its pursuit.  The motivations for iconoclasm are rarely the "removal and denial of admonition".
1.2.6.10.1. Pro: Removing iconography does not erase the past, but it does impoverish the future. If someone has a problem with historical icons, they have the problem, not the icon.
1.2.6.10.2. Pro: Perhaps one of the best examples of purging monuments disliked by authorities is the Cultural Revolution of Mao Zedong, in China, where Mao called on youths to purge [“impure” elements of Chinese society](http://www.history.com/topics/cultural-revolution)." In response, the young Red Guards rose up and [destroyed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution) thousands of historical, cultural and religious sites, and relics.
1.2.6.10.2.1. Con: The Cultural Revolution was in fact enacted by an authoritarian regime. The removal of Confederate monuments and symbols is being carried out by democratically elected city governments.
1.2.6.10.2.1.1. Con: If one trusts democracy, then they would support putting the tearing down of monuments to a public vote. This would allow those communities who identify with heroic, though by no means racist, aspects of their their southern ancestors to keep their statues, and those communities who do not to remove them. I suspect such votes are not much pushed by those against the statues, because they fear that the public may not hold what the protesters see as the "right" view on the matter.
1.2.6.10.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.
1.2.7. Con: It is an established practice to not memorialise all of history through public monuments, but only those parts that represent values and ideals congruent with what the US stands for today.
1.2.7.1. Pro: A monument can portray a person or event in either a positive or negative way. The meaning of a monument of a general, proud on his horse with weapons in hand, is very different than the meaning of a statue of that same general after defeat, shackled as a prisoner. Erecting or removing monuments doesn't change history, but it does change the way we view history. We should remove the ones that portray history in a way that contradicts modern values.
1.2.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.4.2.
1.2.7.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.
1.2.7.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.1.
1.2.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.4.2.
1.2.7.3. Con: This presupposes that there are "values and ideals" that can be identified as "congruent with what the US stands for today," when it's very obvious that the American people are as divided as ever. It's hard to think of any figure, historical or modern, that nearly all Americans would support memorializing.
1.2.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.
1.2.7.4. Pro: The symbols presented in public places, such as courthouses and schools are meant to represent the current beliefs of a culture. These symbols should be replaced with more accurate and active symbols of the current state of culture.
1.2.7.4.1. Pro: No black man who sees a courthouse decorated with reverence for the oppressors of his ancestors can expect justice within.
1.2.7.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.4.
1.2.7.4.2. Pro: Schools that present monuments celebrating the confederacy in the conflict could potentially encourage racist bullying.
1.2.7.4.2.1. Con: Monuments could also encourage better understanding of history and political conflict.
1.2.7.4.3. Con: If only a modern society erects modern iconography then it's only a veneration of themselves, and the point of a memorial is missed.
1.2.7.4.3.1. Con: A commemoration of an atrocity belongs in a textbook for historical review, rather than in the public.
1.2.7.4.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2.7.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.3.
1.2.7.5. Pro: Statues are a collection of memories. We take pictures for memories of a wedding, birth, childbirth, etc. More importantly, we display our best memories. Memories not cherished are not kept. Confederate statues and flags belong to a dark, evil and ignorant past. They should not be glorified, but trashed from vicinities, but reported only in print or digital form.
1.2.7.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2.7.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.2.7.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.19.5.2.
1.2.7.5.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.
1.2.7.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.1.
1.2.7.6. Pro: We do not erect monuments to serial killers, drug lords or head of organized crimes families, all of which are part of our history. The Confederacy was founded to preserve the crime of slavery.
1.2.7.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2.7.6.2. Con: Slavery was the wedge issue the two groups went to war over, but most of those who placed these statues believe the issue is local heritage and governance.
1.2.7.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.
1.2.7.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.2.7.6.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.3.
1.2.7.6.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.
1.2.7.6.6. Con: The Confederacy was founded for the same reason the US was before it. In retaliation to, and fear of, oppressive federal governments.
1.2.7.6.7. Con: The actions of serial killers, drug lords and other criminals were never acceptable nor did they have public support, neither today nor in their historical context. The Confederacy, in contrast to that, had significant public support.
1.2.7.6.7.1. Con: This is false because there is ample evidence that "[serial killers are transformed into larger-than-life popular culture celebrities through the combined efforts of law enforcement authorities, the news and entertainment media, and the public’s appetite for the macabre](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wicked-deeds/201409/here-s-why-we-love-serial-killers)."
1.2.8. Con: Erecting and removing monuments doesn't "change" or "control" history, It only impacts the way we perceive history. As perceptions of history change, what we choose to memorialize should change as well.
1.2.8.1. Pro: In particular, erecting a statue gives the perception of celebrating that history, and removing the statue, of judging and condemning that history. In a sense this supports the initial argument. Actively judging history via continual statue editing could help shape the future by clearly signaling values: encouraging the ones we celebrate, condemning the ones we don't.
1.2.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2.8.2. Con: What we choose to memorialize does not always have to be something we admonish. The holocaust memorial exists for example.
1.2.8.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.2.1.3.1.
1.2.8.3. Pro: Statues and monuments are the representation of history from those who have/had the power to say how things should be remembered.
1.2.8.4. Pro: History is maintained through books, articles, eye-witness accounts, etc, not through statues.
1.2.8.4.1. Pro: If every single statue of Julius Caesar were removed, he would still be well known and documented in history books.
1.2.9. Con: The power to put up statues is also the power to control history. There was no such control on what statues came up, hence we can't use this argument for what statues should come down.
1.2.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.19.5.5.2.
1.2.9.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.2.3.2.1.1.2.
1.2.10. Con: History is never objective because it is written by the victors. The status quo is based in white supremacy. Therefore, by using this power as sparingly as possible, we perpetuate the violent agenda that is the status quo.
1.2.10.1. Con: Monuments are not violent and therefore they do not warrant federal government intervention to protect citizens from them.
1.2.10.1.1. Con: Protection doesn't imply only protection from violence, such as protection from [psychological trauma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma).
1.2.10.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.7.2.1.
1.2.10.1.2. Con: White supremacists use the statues as rally points, and that has fixed them as symbols of racism for much of the public.
1.2.10.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.2.
1.2.10.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.4.2.
1.2.10.1.2.3. Pro: Taking them down is a matter of public safety and security for all citizens, white and non-white.
1.2.10.1.2.3.1. Pro: Cities like Baltimore and Annapolis have taken down Confederate monuments because they became [rallying points](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/democrats-say-confederate-monuments-are-now-white-supremacist-rallying-points/2017/08/20/b735142e-85ad-11e7-a94f-3139abce39f5_story.html?utm_term=.afedd413a3e0) for white supremacists.
1.2.10.1.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.1.
1.2.10.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: The number of [hate groups](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2017/year-hate-and-extremism) presently operating in the US is at near-historic highs and the number and severity of [hate incidents](https://thinkprogress.org/thinkprogress-has-been-tracking-hate-since-trumps-election-here-s-what-we-found-e0288ed69869/) is also high.
1.2.10.1.2.3.2. Pro: Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan asked for the [removal](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-hogan-taney-statue-20170815-story.html) of a Roger B. Taney statue \(the Supreme Court chief justice who upheld slavery\) after [Charlottesville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally) violent protests considering that the monuments have become a "rallying point for white supremacists and bigots".
1.2.10.2. Con: "History written by the victors" was true in antiquity, but not today. There is a new ethos where scholars often do extensive research to represent claims and opinions from both sides of a conflict- winning and losing. [Ironically, their inability to present a balanced view is often caused by one side destroying physical evidence of the other.](http://arthistoryteachingresources.org/lessons/art-and-cultural-heritage-looting-and-destruction/)
1.2.10.2.1. Pro: [Destruction of historic artifacts leads to the inability to tell the story of the losing side in a conflict. Destruction of the culture and history of the losing side has been often used to suppress a culture or people.](http://arthistoryteachingresources.org/lessons/art-and-cultural-heritage-looting-and-destruction/)
1.2.10.3. Con: The claim history is written by the victors goes directly against the historical manufacturing of the Lost Cause myth, which was written almost exclusively by the losers These statues were put up to perpetuate the Lost Cause myth.
1.2.10.3.1. Pro: The myth of the Lost Cause was created and maintained to vindicate the South's cause and demonstrate Southern Honor. History was purposefully skewed by the United Daughters in work on textbooks and journalists like Pollard. The best works on the myth creation, and the monuments and memorials intended to celebrate the myth are Wilson _Baptized in Blood_ , Connelly and Bellows _God and General Longstreet_, Towns _Enduring Legacy_ and Goldfield _Still Fighting the Civil War_.
1.2.11. Pro: We cannot decide which parts of history to remember and which parts to ignore. Every part of our history is part of our history, whether we like it or not, unless there is an objective moral framework against which we're all willing to submit ourselves to. It's clear there isn't. We need to respect the facts and leave them as they are.
1.2.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.
1.2.11.2. Con: To say there is no 'objective moral framework' is to wipe your hands of this discussion, for this is a moral debate. The existence of any monuments or statues indicates a subjective moral decision by individuals/governments/business to glorify particular events/ideas/figures. This debate is not about remembering history, but of which parts of history we, as a society, deem worthy of moral glorification.
1.2.11.2.1. Pro: Most government actions involve some sort of subjective moral claim. To deny the ability of the government to operate on subjective morality is to deny the ability of government to exist.
1.2.11.2.2. Con: The term, "objective moral framework" is an oxymoron. Morality is, by definition, subjective and defined by majority opinion.
1.2.11.3. Con: To remember history does not require the construction of a memorial.  A memorial is used as a cultural touchstone for a given event and draws attention to that specific event.  To argue that all history be remembered would require the construction of memorials to every event in history, no matter how mundane.  This is practically and physically impossible so a framework must exist to determine which moments are worth of memorializing and the context in which the memorial will be presented.
1.2.11.3.1. Pro: To take this argument even further: memorials actually distort our perception of the past. Erecting statues of people and events that a certain ideological perspective thinks are significant/worthy of veneration we ignore other people and events. A statue of a great man makes us remember his actions, but not his slaves, or his wife, or any sort of nuanced view of the context in which he lived. Historical research is for interpreting the past, memorials are for celebrating it.
1.2.11.4. Pro: Removal of these artifacts is editing of history. They should remain as a reminder of progress.
1.2.11.4.1. Pro: History must be engaged on its own terms. One cannot cherry-pick aspects of a nation's history to show it in a desired, and ultimately flawed, manner.
1.2.11.4.2. Con: Statues and monuments are not mere reminders of history, they're meant to honor specific individuals. Presenting objective accounts of these individuals in museums and books is the appropriate way to preserve our history so it is not erased for future generations, honoring them as though they are heroes is not.
1.2.11.4.3. Con: Rewriting a text book to provide anything other than facts is entirely different than removing a statue that glorifies one of the worst parts of our history.
1.2.11.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.19.5.5.
1.2.11.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.4.2.
1.2.11.4.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.19.5.2.
1.2.11.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.4.
1.2.11.4.5. Pro: We should be asking ourselves why these monuments have stayed up until today. This is a modern day version of [Chesterton's Fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence). We need to learn from history, not flail around trying to erase it.
1.2.11.4.5.1. Con: Removing monuments is not erasing history, since that implies any event or person that does not have a monument built has been forgotten or erased.
1.2.11.4.5.2. Pro: More precisely we need to enlarge what is understood to be the history. What is embodied in these statues is a single perspective. If the statues were to, say, add a chain in the hand of the man on the horse and have it linked to an iron neck ring on a black slave, it would be adding more of the actual history. As it is we are stuck in a myth, a simplification of the history, that is giving rise to the current perturbations.
1.2.11.4.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.4.
1.2.11.4.5.2.2. Con: No one is opposing different views being presented. The controversy is removing monuments to Confederate leaders that include their virtues.
1.2.11.5. Con: European and other countries have removed a lot of statues for leaders of dictatorships without forgetting about their painful history. Monuments to tyrants are not needed in order to teach and remember history.
1.2.11.5.1. Con: Monuments are teachers. If you remove the teacher, you remove the lesson of history.
1.2.11.5.1.1. Con: We learn about history without monuments or memorials. Statues are not meant to teach history, but to celebrate or honor it.  If something/someone is worth learning about, we will, statue or no statue.
1.2.11.5.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.
1.2.11.5.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.19.1.
1.2.11.5.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.
1.2.11.5.1.2. Con: The present monuments teach an edited version of history, anyone who learns from them is unlikely to be correct.
1.2.11.5.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.4.
1.2.11.5.1.2.2. Pro: For example, there are few statues to Longstreet, because Longstreet turned against the confederacy after the war.
1.2.11.5.1.3. Con: A monument may present a learning opportunity but it is not in and of itself a teacher without more context.
1.2.11.5.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.
1.2.11.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.
1.2.11.5.3. Con: However, in Australia, [Captain Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook) served the British Empire, not Australia, as General Lee served colonial aristocracy, not American democracy, yet Cook [statues](https://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/landscape/discovery/display/22869-captain-james-cook) are kept as the difference is known.
1.2.11.5.3.1. Con: There is recently debate to [remove](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/23/sydney-under-pressure-over-captain-cook-statue-claim-he-discovered-australia) Captain James Cook [statues](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-41020363) in Australia.
1.2.11.5.4. Con: In the Netherlands there is a similar debate. This country has been a seafaring nation of renown. In the 16th and 17th century it was a naval power second to none. There are therefore statues and street names of national heroes everywhere. Since our history involves colonialism and slavery, some people want to remove these statues etc. That would be equal to sweeping one's history under the carpet and replacing it with a clean but false image.
1.2.11.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.2.1.
1.2.11.5.6. Pro: Removal of monuments does not, in itself, mean that history is being rewritten or ignored. For example, I do not think that Spain's removal of statues to [General Franco](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/18/franco-statue-spain) has, in any way, erased that government from history. What it does say it that Spain, as a modern democracy, does not wish to promote that part of its recent history.
1.2.11.6. Pro: The statues should stay; the statue of Robert E Lee makes perfect sense of why it’s in Richmond. The capital of the Confederacy was Richmond. It makes perfect sense why it should stay.
1.2.11.7. Pro: The statues aren’t hurting anybody, and they may be a bit offensive to some people, and it’s a part of our history. And we can’t just burn the records of history even if we don’t want to remember.
1.2.12. Pro: Removal should not be an option unless procedures are in place to ensure the majority of US citizens support it.
1.2.12.1. Con: Putting the decision to the majority is futile since policy decisions in the US are often made regardless of whether or not the majority agrees.
1.2.12.1.1. Pro: Additionally, majority rules still discounts a significant portion of the population whose opinions should be just as important.
1.2.12.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.
1.2.12.1.2. Pro: [For example](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-11-28/how-trump-lost-the-popular-vote-and-won-the-2016-election), although Donald Trump \(and many other presidential candidates in the past\) won the electoral vote, he lost the popular vote and was thus elected president despite the majority not having voted for him.
1.2.12.1.3. Pro: [One major study](http://www.businessinsider.com/major-study-finds-that-the-us-is-an-oligarchy-2014-4), which looked at 1,800 policies enacted over a span of 20 years, found that U.S. policy-making is dominated by the nation's economic elite with average citizens having little to no influence.
1.2.12.1.4. Con: The United States is ranked among the most free and democratic nations in the world. Claiming that decisions are commonly made that oppose the majority will of the citizens ignores the fact that the United States is a representative republic- electing legislators who serve at the will of the public, implementing laws based on popular support, personal experience, and moral tradition, and that the federal government and other states do not control most aspects of a state's decisions.
1.2.12.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.
1.2.12.2. Pro: The United States, and state, county, and city governments each have spaces that they control. The US government cannot legally change other governments' spaces.
1.2.12.2.1. Pro: If a government that owns the space finds a reason to change the décor of that space, then it is their right to change it.
1.2.12.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.
1.2.12.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.
1.2.12.2.2. Con: The central government has supremacy over local government. That means that every space, ultimately, is a federal government space.
1.2.12.2.2.1. Con: The Constitution limits the Federal Government to certain activities. Taking down monuments because some don't like them is not one of those listed.
1.2.12.2.2.2. Con: The people have supremacy over all government, and these monuments are still popularly supported.
1.2.12.2.2.3. Con: The Federal Government only has supremacy on Federal lands, and in narrow cases as authorized by the Constitution.
1.2.12.2.2.4. Con: In City of Boerne vs. Flores, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress has no Constitutional Right to micromanage how cities use their land. [casebriefs.com](https://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/constitutional-law/constitutional-law-keyed-to-sullivan/the-post-civil-war-amendments-and-civil-rights-legislation-constitutional-restraints-on-private-conduct-congressional-power-to-implement-the-amendments/city-of-boerne-v-flores-4/)
1.2.12.2.3. Con: Protecting its citizens and condemning traitors is certainly a function of the federal government, therefore it should override other gubernamental instances or spaces.
1.2.12.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.3.1.
1.2.12.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.10.1.
1.2.12.2.4. Pro: The federal government should definitely not make this decision, which should be made locally or at the state level.
1.2.12.2.4.1. Pro: In fact, the [10th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) of the Constitution demands that the Federal Government not change structures not under their jurisdiction.
1.2.12.2.4.1.1. Con: The Fourteenth [Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), and subsequent constitutional law [interpreting](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/federalism-in-1868-and-2012) it, have greatly curtailed the states rights.
1.2.12.2.4.1.2. Con: Local and state legislatures and voters can still vote and proceed to remove, thereby making this argument moot.
1.2.12.2.4.2. Pro: The US, as a political entity, did not set up these Confederate memorials. They were, instead, erected by cities and/or states, respectively. For example, Frederick, Maryland has a statue of native son Justice Roger Taney, who authored the infamous "Dred Scott" decision. Frederick's statue of Taney reflects its unique history, which should not be displaced by the nation as a whole.
1.2.12.2.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.
1.2.12.2.4.3. Pro: The US cannot remove Confederate memorials, flags, and monuments from public spaces. People, not legal fictions, can remove Confederate memorials, flags, and monuments from public spaces.
1.2.12.2.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.12.2.4.1.2.
1.2.12.2.4.4. Pro: The artifacts are a representation of the people in that area, therefore it should be the choice of those in that area to choose what monuments best represent them and no one else.
1.2.12.2.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.
1.2.12.2.4.4.2. Con: The people of that area includes the black population, slaves, and union supporters. In all cases, their opinions were ignored, even derided as many monuments were erected as a backlash to civil rights movements much later after the war ended.
1.2.12.2.5. Con: Legally, they can. As the federal government controls and oversees the lower levels. The federal government can deem such statues inappropriate and have them taken down, whether or not the should remains to be seen.
1.2.12.3. Pro: According to an [NPR poll](http://www.npr.org/2017/08/16/543957964/poll-majority-believe-trump-s-response-to-charlottesville-hasn-t-been-strong-eno), the only \(polled\) demographic in which the majority is in favor of removal are Democrats. All other polled political and racial demographic groups are largely in favor of the monuments remaining.
1.2.12.4. Pro: Most of the decisions in the United States are made at a city, county or state level, not national.
1.2.12.5. Con: Our government is set up to protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority.
1.2.12.6. Con: Why? There was no vote when they were erected by small groups or by individuals.
1.2.12.7. Pro: No one should decide what should be eliminated from the knowledge of our History.
1.2.12.7.1. Con: -> See 1.2.11.5.1.1.
1.2.12.7.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.2.
1.2.12.8. Pro: The power to take down a statue has the potential for abuse and should be exercised with caution.
1.2.12.8.1. Con: -> See 1.2.11.4.3.
1.2.12.8.2. Pro: Removing confederate statues or indeed any public memorial that one faction views negatively is that you create the same type of intellectual vacuum we see now in the regions controlled by the Taliban/ ISIS. Obliteration of icons of a fallen foe is a demonstration of assumed superiority. Use them as a teachable moment.
1.2.12.8.3. Con: These monuments are themselves an Orwellian re-write of history, with their glorification of traitors and their claims that they are about 'heritage, not hatred'. "Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia" is equal to "The American Civil War was fought over states' rights and not slavery".
1.2.12.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.19.5.2.4.7.
1.2.12.9. Pro: Removing the monuments by what seems to be an arbitrary act of anti-majoritarian power would inflame resentments, while removing the same monuments through a referendum initiative, with all the guarantees of public debate and secret ballots, would have the opposite effect.
1.2.12.9.1. Pro: The way history is remembered is part of a society's public record. A democratic majority is the only legitimate way of changing it.
1.2.13. Con: Statues that go against American values should not remain standing.
1.2.13.1. Pro: The purpose of erecting flags, statues, memorials, and monuments is to perform an evocation of the "[monumental aura](https://books.google.com/books?id=srsRDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA633&lpg=PA633&dq=monumental+aura+psychology&source=bl&ots=dY2JyR1vPM&sig=GGhsw9SIyYEJZu71J0AVL30dMUU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiqu_Go2IHXAhVBwiYKHZRRCKIQ6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&q=monumental%20aura%20psychology&f=false)," a psychological phenomenon associated with totems that are understood to represent noble acts, shared values, ideological ideals, and to memorialize human sacrifice.
1.2.13.1.1. Pro: With regards to the Confederacy, this instills a history of moral depravity, incomprehensible acts of atrocity, and perverse ideology with an aura of heroic reverence and glorification. The monuments to the Confederacy should be destroyed.
1.2.13.2. Pro: We decided as a society in 1865, through war and then legislation, that slavery was wrong.  Although these statues are a part of history, they go against what government/society has established as morally wrong and should not be displayed in public or in government spaces.  These statues could be put in a museum to help explain the war, and also explain the purpose for erecting the statues years after the war ended.
1.2.13.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2.13.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.1.

1.2.13.2.6. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.
1.2.13.2.7. Pro: On the 20th day of October, 1774 Congress issued the following: "This agreement contained a clause to discontinue the slave trade, and a provision not to import East India tea from any part of the world. In the article respecting non-exportations, the sending of rice to Europe was excepted.
" On the 1st of April, 1775 Congress issued the following " On this occasion, the importation of slaves was expressly prohibited. "
1.2.13.3. Pro: The U.S. was founded on an equality principle embodied in the words "All men are created equal." In contrast, the Confederacy was founded on an inequality principle made clear in Alexander Stephens' Cornerstone Speech. In [that speech](https://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~ras2777/amgov/stephens.html), Stephens described slavery as a natural condition of an inferior race.
1.2.13.3.1. Con: Blacks were not considered to be people or were at least considered inferior by most people, North and South, during the time of the Civil War.
1.2.13.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.
1.2.13.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.
1.2.13.3.1.3. Pro: The [Dred Scott decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford) by the Supreme Court rejected the idea that slaves were citizens who could vote or take legal action in court, held that slaves from slave states could not be freed in free states, and rejected the Missouri Compromise as unconstitutional.
1.2.13.3.1.4. Pro: Even the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison was of the opinion that the US constitution before and at the beginning of the Civil War was a [pro-slavery document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lloyd_Garrison#The_woman_question_and_division) and opposed it on these grounds.
1.2.13.3.2. Con: The Declaration of Independence did declare that 'all men are created equal,' but the US Constitution established a long list of addendum, defining what a man was. Women wouldn't get a look in until 1920. Even the Emancipation Proclamation was riddled with exceptions and allowances; later, the KKK was widespread throughout the country, not just the South.
1.2.13.3.3. Con: The United States was built upon the backs of black men and women: the country  was founded on [slavery](http://time.com/4274901/slavery-traces-history/) and thus was not really based on equality principles as the whole country \(including Northern states\) [profited](http://www.publicseminar.org/2014/04/slavery-the-capital-that-made-capitalism/) from slave's trade and forced work.
1.2.13.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.6.2.
1.2.13.4. Pro: The Confederacy was unique in its explicit support for white supremacy and its active treason against the United States. Unlike other statues, there is literally nothing of value in what they fought for.
1.2.13.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.2.13.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2.13.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.4.2.
1.2.13.4.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.
1.2.13.5. Pro: Statues do not simply commemorate people, they commemorate ideas and values. The Lincoln Memorial is not simply dedicated to Lincoln himself but rather the work that he did for the country. Statues of Confederate soldiers commemorate the fight to keep slavery which is not one that should be commemorated in our society today.
1.2.13.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2.13.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.2.13.6. Pro: When the Civil War ended the Confederates laid down their rifles and took up their [pens](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/01/why-do-people-believe-myths-about-the-confederacy-because-our-textbooks-and-monuments-are-wrong/?utm_term=.3eef386b7e37) to rewrite their own history. The romance of the Confederacy is the result, and a part of that romantic fiction are the monuments erected many decades later, often in states that were against the Confederacy. Their success can be observed in Kentucky, a state from which only 35,000 fought for the Confederacy, while 90,000 fought for the Union, and still Jefferson Davis stands in the capital rotunda.
1.2.13.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.
1.2.13.8. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.
1.2.13.9. Con: Destroying art we don't like, memorials of those we disagree with and burning books we find subversive is against American values and in line of regimes such as the Taliban.
1.2.13.9.1. Pro: Whether or not people like it, it was a part of American history. Destroying history is rewriting history, and that is exactly what suppressive regimes do.
1.2.13.9.1.1. Con: Memorializing the Confederacy through statues was a systematic effort to rewrite history and generated a number of myths about the Confederacy.
1.2.13.9.1.1.1. Pro: This is a purely modern reinterpretation of these historical objects, and is not borne out by the historical record.  Many Confederate memorials were placed by Confederate veterans themselves.  They therefore deserve recognition as historical artifacts.
1.2.13.9.1.1.1.1. Con: The historicity of monuments is not solely about age. The large number of mass-produced, catalogue-bought monuments means most of them are historically insignificant.
1.2.13.9.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Companies like [McNeil Marbles](https://avenueofarmies.wordpress.com/the-1918-confederate-veterans-monument/mcneil-marble-company/) sold large numbers of monuments at low prices by catalogue. This means most statues are not unique and so not valuable.
1.2.13.9.2. Pro: Erasing historic landmarks solely based on someone's individual values is similar to the conduct of ISIS. History may in the future view our generation the same way our current generation views ISIS's [destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_cultural_heritage_by_ISIL) of historic monuments.
1.2.13.9.2.1. Con: Many of the monuments do not date from the appropriate historical period \(Civil War\) and thus have a political, rather than historical meaning.
1.2.13.9.2.1.1. Con: While some statues were from a later period this argument does not apply to all statues being considered for removal \([SPLC, p. 12](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/whoseheritage_splc.pdf)\).
1.2.13.9.2.1.1.1. Con: Statues that are not from the time around the civil war should be removed.
1.2.13.9.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Only nine statues in courthouse grounds and other sites where actually built during the civil war period [\(SPLC, p. 12\)](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/whoseheritage_splc.pdf).
1.2.13.9.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Only around 30 statues were built right after the civil war, some just when [Ku Klux Klan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan) was created [\(SPLC, p. 12\)](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/whoseheritage_splc.pdf).
1.2.13.9.2.1.2. Con: Even though numerous monuments were put up well after the Civil War, many of them are nearly [one hundred years old](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/whoseheritage_splc.pdf) and thus have their own historical significance.
1.2.13.9.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.2.2.
1.2.13.9.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.
1.2.13.9.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.13.9.1.1.1.1.
1.2.13.9.3. Con: Putting them into a museum where they can be contextualized is not destroying them or removing them from public view.
1.2.13.9.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.
1.2.13.9.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.
1.2.13.9.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.
1.2.13.9.3.4. Pro: Moving a monument is not the same as destroying it or rewriting history.
1.2.13.9.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.
1.2.13.9.3.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.
1.2.13.9.4. Con: Our country is founded on the idea that there are "self-evident" truths. It is self-evident that people shouldn't be bought and sold. This is not a matter of opinion. To the extent that these monuments represent an affirmation of the contrary, they should not be place on public grounds.
1.2.13.9.4.1. Con: To the extent that Confederate monuments do not or could be made not to be an affirmation of people being bought or sold, they should remain on public grounds.
1.2.13.9.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.13.3.1.
1.2.13.9.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.18.3.2.1.
1.2.13.10. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1.1.
1.2.13.11. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.4.
1.2.13.12. Con: This approach is inconsistent since it ignores the fundamental beliefs that justify these practices to begin with, namely religious beliefs. Strong religious beliefs have been used to justify slavery, genocide, and countless civil rights violations over the centuries. If society wishes to decry memorials to the action, then it should decry memorials to the motivation behind the action as well.
1.2.13.12.1. Con: There were those that opposed slavery for religious reasons.The abolitionists are perfect examples- this includes people such as Lyman Beecher, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Charles Finney, Theodore Weld, Sojourner Truth, and many more, such as the Quakers.
1.2.13.12.1.1. Pro: If the discussion of religion is at all germane to the discussion of Confederate monuments, then we should preserve those religious monuments on public grounds that oppose slavery. Thus, a statue of Jesus with the quote, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" should be maintained on public grounds. Any blanket rejection of all religious monuments within this debate is off topic.
1.2.13.12.2. Con: Religious fervor was equal and greater against slavery and was incidental to the region.  Religion in and of itself was most certainly not the factor of division.

IE.  General Oliver O. Howard fought for the north and was deeply Christian.  General George B. McClellan was deeply religious and upon his orders, the Sabbath was observed throughout the Union Army.
1.2.13.13. Pro: The question of public memorial is one of honor not of history. History, whether good or evil, is preserved primarily in books and other records. If an aspect of history is offensive it should absolutely be taught in schools but should not be honored with a statue.
1.2.13.13.1. Con: Many Americans see these statues as historical pieces. While some find them offensive, the First Amendment protects art, just as when a New York museum displayed Christ being urinated on. The First Amendment was written to protect offensive speech and art, not to protect popular speech or art.  From a historical point they act as a reminder of where we were and don't want to go again, but go forward to make life better for all.
1.2.13.13.1.1. Con: Taking down monuments does not constitute a violation of free speech.
1.2.13.13.1.1.1. Con: The existence of the monuments is a political issue. The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that political speech and activities are, in fact, included in exercises of free speech, [and most Americans agree it should be](http://www.gallup.com/poll/125333/Public-Agrees-Court-Campaign-Money-Free-Speech.aspx).
1.2.13.13.1.1.1.1. Con: The removal of the monuments would then also be considered free speech. Therefore, the removal of the statues would not be a violation of free speech.
1.2.13.13.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.19.5.5.2.

1.2.13.13.1.1.4. Pro: Taking down monuments is not a violation of free speech in the cases where they are on public land.
1.2.13.13.1.1.4.1. Pro: The first amendment does not apply to public land as has been decided [time](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/02/politics/oklahoma-supreme-court-orders-removal/index.html) and [time again](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-cross-idUSBRE85O0WJ20120625).
1.2.13.13.1.1.4.1.1. Con: [The First Amendment applies to public land.](http://scholarship.law.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&context=plrlr) These cases are instead about [the Constitutional conflict of principles between religion and state and permanent religious monuments.](http://www.annenbergclassroom.org/speakout/when-do-religious-symbols-on-public-land-violate-the-first-amendment)

1.2.13.13.1.3. Con: A governing institution erecting a memorial conveys that institution's endorsement of what the statue represents. While maintaining Confederate memorials is legal, we need not encourage this offensive speech.
1.2.13.13.1.4. Con: Just because it is legal to do something doesn't make it moral to do so.
1.2.13.13.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.13.13.1.1.4.1.
1.2.13.13.2. Con: If we keep destroying monuments which are connected to something immoral, we will not have much history left. With this attitude, pyramids where thousands of people were sacrificed in Mexico would have to be taken down as well.
1.2.13.13.2.1. Con: The statues should belong in a museum not in the public. A good compromise would be to let the base stand but have the statue removed so we can remember who we used to honor.
1.2.13.13.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.
1.2.13.13.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.
1.2.13.13.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.
1.2.13.13.2.2. Con: Statues that are taken be down can be moved into museums; large monuments obviously can't be moved without tremendous effort.  This puts monuments into two categories; things that can be moved and things that can't.  They have to be handled separately.
1.2.13.13.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.1.
1.2.13.13.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.
1.2.13.13.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.
1.2.13.13.2.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.
1.2.13.13.2.3. Con: The pyramids in Mexico were erected to honor the religious beliefs of the people at the time, not as a glorification of human sacrifices.
1.2.13.13.2.4. Con: If there were statues recently created to commemorate those committing human sacrifices on the pyramids, of course many people would want them taken down.
1.2.13.13.2.5. Con: The pyramids have inherent historical significance because of what they are whereas the Confederate monuments only commemorate historical events while having no intrinsic historical significance.
1.2.13.13.2.5.1. Pro: There is no controversy as to whether or not we should tear down the Alamo or Auschwitz.
1.2.13.13.2.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.2.13.13.2.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.2.13.13.2.5.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.1.
1.2.13.13.2.5.5. Pro: Ancient pyramids have intrinsic value because they are archaeological artifacts. As such they are reminder of and a glimpse into a culture *that no longer exists*. Confederate statues are not yet archaeological artifacts because the divisive culture that once supported them has not yet died.
1.2.13.14. Pro: Public symbols have long been used as a means to reinforce state sanctioned beliefs and ideals, particularly during times when those ideals were threatened.  A majority of the confederate symbols fall into this categorization.  If they no longer represent the current beliefs and ideals they should be removed and relegated to a historical representation such as a museum.
1.2.14. Con: Controlling the future vis a vis the past is okay when that means delegitimizing possible future racism. If the political agenda this power is being employed for is fighting against racism, then that political agenda lines up pretty well with the good of society.
1.2.15. Con: Romanticizing the losers of that war only serves to engender continued opposition to the current establishment, and creates conflict where there should be none.
1.2.15.1. Con: Nevertheless, opposition to the establishment is one of the concepts that led to the very creation of the US. Critical opinions about current systems are definitely not something that should be censored and neither should critical opinions of the past be hidden away from the public.
1.2.15.1.1. Con: Critical opinions against the establishment should be encouraged, however, ideals that position one race over another conflict with US values.
1.2.16. Pro: The side that wins writes history. The atrocities committed by the British in India and the French in Indochina are largely forgotten because they were the victors. In England and France, there are very few reminders of colonialism, and because of this some people think "colonialism wasn't that bad" or "colonialism was good." Therefore Americans shouldn't hide what happened, it is there and people should know it.
1.2.16.1. Con: Germany found many more meaningful ways to remember Hitler than keeping his statues up. Perhaps we could do the same.
1.2.16.2. Con: Though we should remember, we should not honor the mistakes of the past. We should put up monuments that celebrate those who lived through the struggle and came out stronger. Not those who were arguably causing the problems.
1.2.16.3. Con: This is a false equivelency, whatever the faults of the Union in the Civil War, they were in no ways comparable to the depravity of the Confederacy.
1.2.16.4. Con: History, however, is not remembered solely by statues and monuments; but rather by examining primary and validated secondary resources, from readings and artifacts of that time. Monuments are built with the intention of celebrating some famous event or person; as such, we are not in this day and age celebrating such events and morals.
1.2.16.5. Con: The statues could be replaced with new monuments commemorating the removal of monuments celebrating colonialism and slavery.  The new monuments could easily contain elements that document the history.
1.2.17. Con: As the parent claim stands, no instance can be deemed acceptable to remove a monument because they haven't defined when/why one can or can not remove one. This ambiguity precludes actual analysis of the claim. The writer of the parent claim needs to outline the criteria for allowing a monument to be removed, or else, as constructed, their argument wrongly bars all removals because it is equally applicable to any monument. Sparingly means some times, not never.
1.2.18. Con: The power to dismantle memorials is - at minimum - equivalent to that of erecting them; and is actually superior since the former only exists to obviate the latter.
1.2.19. Con: In Lithuania, statues of Communist leaders were removed from locations that glorified them and brought and displayed in a single space, [Grutas Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C5%ABtas_Park). That way, that portion of their history could be retained and remembered without glorifying it. There is no reason to believe something similar couldn't be done in the US.
1.2.20. Con: Choosing to leave monuments in place in the face of public outcry for their removal is just as much an editorial decision as removing them would be. Either way, the government is making a conscientious decision about the narrative it wishes to project, and either action affects the future by editorializing the past. The state-sanctioned messaging of public monuments should be, to the greatest extent possible, kept in-line with society's current ethical moorings.
1.2.21. Con: The power to remove statues rests with each governmental entity, and it's something they already have. The above statement appears to assume we're talking about the existence of the power rather than the use of it. The power already exists.
1.2.22. Con: To remove a statue from a public place is to exercise some control over what our society publicly glorifies, not what is remembered by our history. By all means maintain these statues as museum pieces for their undeniable historical value. However, when someone's statue is maintained by public money in a public space, it's reasonable to read that as an endorsement of the person rather that just a historical point.
1.2.22.1. Con: No reasonable person believes that any population of Americans endorse slavery.
1.2.22.1.1. Con: While this statement is presumably true, it is not a con of its parent, but a pro: If Americans do not endorse slavery, then Americans should not erect and maintain monuments to individuals who not only endorsed but seceded and fought to uphold it. To do otherwise sends a message that is incongruous with the attitude being asserted here.
1.2.23. Con: If the goal of statue removers were to control history, we would see a more massive effort, especially in education, to change history. Removing statues from public land is simply about not wanting to honor the fight to preserve this nations largest historical stain. No one says we shouldn't learn about it. We say we shouldn't honor and glorify it.
1.2.24. Con: If removing the statues is controlling history, then putting up statues is also controlling history and should not have been done in the first place.
1.2.25. Con: History is constantly evolving and our views on history change. Many events are celebrated in the past then quietly forgotten by later generations. To say that every event and piece of history must be preserved and celebrated would be impossible to do.
1.3. Pro: The principal legacy of Confederate statues is white supremacy and slavery. Since this fundamentally conflicts with American values and ideas, they should be removed.
1.3.1. Con: The country was founded as a Republic to prevent the tyranny of the majority.  It was not founded to permit a tyranny of the minorities.  There is no prohibition against offensive speech in the Constitution.  Indeed, the 1st Amendment specifically protects such speech. Whether the statues are interpreted by some as pro-slavery is irrelevant.
1.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.13.1.1.
1.3.1.2. Con: These monuments are often owned by the government on public land; in such cases they should be thought of as communal rather than individual speech. Of course, if the monuments were constructed on private land they should be considered protected speech.
1.3.1.3. Con: Government declining to accept speech as its own expression is not the same as government preventing expression of those ideas. Removing monuments from public land only eliminates government as the speaker. It does not eliminate the message.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: The next logical step down this path would be for the government to prohibit any offensive speech on government property. And to turn all government property into "safe zones."
1.3.1.3.2. Pro: When municipal funds are used for the upkeep of a statue, it can be considered the government endorsing a particular idea.
1.3.1.4. Con: Duly elected representatives removing monuments from public land does not prevent free expression.  Rather, a monument on public land is an expression by the government, typically honoring the person depicted in the monument, so removing it is an expression by the government to no longer honor that person.
1.3.1.5. Pro: To be truly inclusive ALL ideologies must be allowed freedom of legal expression. To suppress our nation's history because it is offensive to some is wrongheaded. We want people who hate to be able to express themselves. Suppressing hate speech lends creedence to hate rhetoric. Suppression implies those who wish to suppress have no valid counterargument. Hate speech should be welcomed and then the arguments for hate thoroughly dismantled for all to see. Suppression is counter to our ideals.
1.3.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.6.1.
1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.1.
1.3.3. Pro: There is already precedent for statues and commemorative icons to be removed because of their strength as rallying points; Germany recognized that acknowledging Nazi landmarks glorified a dark history and created rallying points for white supremacists. They purposefully demolished nazi landmarks and even paved over Hitler's bunker to remove any suggestion of a memorial. Likewise removing these icons in our country would only be to follow in their footsteps.
1.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.2.
1.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.2.1.2.1.
1.3.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.2.1.
1.3.4. Con: 'American values and ideas' aren't just things we can decide on and ignore everything else, there is a violent and troubled history behind us that we have to acknowledge, and removing Confederate monuments doesn't do that.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Confederate statues are unable to make political statements themselves, we ascribe meaning and history to them. Thus, combating the symbols of an ideology we dislike instead of the negative ideology itself is akin to putting a band-aid on a cancer patient, it doesn't fix the problem, it only makes you less likely to think about it since it's out of sight.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Dealing with hatred is a process.  Germany has had plenty of experience with it. The outcome is not as simple as eradicating monuments. The German word Vergangenheitsbewältigung —  “the enduring confrontation with the past.” Perhaps this is a place to start.  [philly.com](http://www.philly.com/philly/opinion/commentary/charlottesville-nazis-germany-communists-monuments-trump-20170817.html)
1.3.4.3. Pro: History is also often in the eye of the beholder and has to fundamentally be considered in the context of its day not in the context of today.  Example, assuming that our founders were white supremacists and judging them because they used slaves to profit means you also have to judge the africans that sold the slaves \(noticeably absent from these debates\).  There is slavery today in many middle eastern countries.  Removing a statue doesn't change the reality that humans profit from slavery.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: Slavery is morally wrong. Removing statues will not stop humans from profiting off of slavery, however it will make a strong statement about the immorality of slavery and our unwillingness to continue turn a blind eye to the systematic racism still present today whose origins are deeply rooted in slavery.
1.3.4.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.3.4.3.2. Con: The reason that African slave traders are absent from these debates is that virtually no living person would suggest erecting a monument in their honor or memorializing them in any way. Basically every single person who condemns white supremacy would also condemn the African slave trade, but it is not relevant to the question as to whether to remove Confederate memorials and monuments.
1.3.4.4. Con: Some \(and perhaps most\) of the confederate monuments were placed specifically to reinforce racial [inequality](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/07/27/confederate-monuments-are-about-maintaining-white-supremacy/?utm_term=.c63bca1d8370). Leaving them as is ignores some necessary historical context, and metaphorically they help hold open some wounds which should be confronted and moved past.
1.3.4.5. Con: The removal is necessary because the presence of confederate statues does not fully acknowledge history thus fails to heal history's wounds, being that the common perception is that monuments oft imply the expectation of reverence.
1.3.5. Pro: These monuments represent a celebration of white supremacy and slavery.
1.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.
1.3.5.2. Pro: The erection of many of the statues was akin to the creation of Columbus day, an attempt to raise white national pride. They often lead to glorification and mis-representation of history and historical fact. The removal of these statues will be akin to the erasing of Columbus day, as has happened in [Los Angeles](http://nypost.com/2017/08/31/los-angeles-will-no-longer-celebrate-columbus-day/).
1.3.5.3. Pro: In addition to the Articles of Secession submitted by every state in the Confederacy, 4 states issued additional documents. These documents, issued by Texas, Mississippi, Georgia & South Carolina, are known as the "Declarations of Causes," which explains the specific reasons behind their secession from the Union. In these documents, all 4 states strongly defend slavery. For descendants of slaves, these monuments can be perceived as celebrating a dark and painful period in US history.[civilwar.org](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/reasons-secession)
1.3.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.1.2.
1.3.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.4.1.
1.3.5.6. Con: The idea that the south was fighting a war for slavery was considered repugnant and anti-south propaganda by the very man whose statues are most often being torn down. Lee's biography records that even then: "Lee expressed his regret that Northern newspapers continued to assert that the object of the war had been to perpetuate slavery. "On this point," wrote Doctor Leyburn in a subsequent report of the interview, "he seemed not only indignant but hurt. He said it was not true." [Freeman](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/People/Robert_E_Lee/FREREL/4/22*.html)
1.3.5.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.
1.3.5.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.5.2.2.1.
1.3.5.6.3. Con: Just because Lee didn't want his cause associated with slavery doesn't mean that wasn't what secession was over.
1.3.5.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.
1.3.5.6.4. Con: The purpose of a conflict can be distinct from the private views of \(one of\) the leaders. In this case, many still see the war as being fought over the issue of slavery.
1.3.5.6.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.
1.3.5.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.
1.3.5.6.5. Pro: Border states \(Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, and West Virginia\) while aligned with the North, were slave holding states. Had the Civil War been primarily about the issue of slavery, they would not have been allowed to retain slaves. Especially because slavery was not an extensive industry in these locations, it would have been easier to eliminate it. [nps.gov](https://www.nps.gov/resources/story.htm%3Fid%3D205)
1.3.5.6.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.6.2.1.
1.3.5.6.5.2. Con: The fact that these Union states held slaves prior to the conflict does not by itself logically invalidate the claim that slavery was a key dispute in the Civil War. A state that held slaves could without contradiction join a faction that was opposed to the continuation slavery.
1.3.5.6.5.3. Con: This claim notes that the slaveholding states that fought on the side of the Union stood to gain a comparative advantage from abolition, and so would in fact have an economic motivation to aid the Union in enacting an end to slavery.
1.3.5.6.6. Con: Following the war, slavery was viewed much more negatively than before the war. Lee would be motivated to represent his participation in the succession in the least unfavorable terms he felt he could support.
1.3.5.7. Con: The meaning of memorials changes depending on the political context. It is not the statutes themselves that represent slavery and white supremacy but what social groups make them to represent.
1.3.5.8. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.
1.3.5.9. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.3.5.10. Pro: A [study](http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/op-ed/article186178233.html#storylink=cpy) from the UNC University, where the Chapel Hill’s “Silent Sam” Confederate statue is, after reviewing 30 dedication speeches, supports that “white nationalism was a fixture of Confederate monumentation” and “Confederate soldier monuments honored veterans for their postwar success in eroding black equality as much as for their failed wartime sacrifices".
1.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.
1.3.7. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.3.1.1.
1.3.8. Con: The principal legacy of a monument is unique to that monument and the community that it is in.
1.3.8.1. Con: In order for a monument to count as a Confederate monument, it must represent ideas that are not unique to that monument nor the local community where the monument is.
1.3.8.2. Pro: In every age there are shameful events. Today, we all tolerate and accept abuses of fellow human beings by North Korea.  Does that mean that the American Flag will represent this travesty and should be judged based solely on our tolerance of what should be intolerable? Confederate memorials, except when such is explicit purpose, are not there to commemorate the shame, but to celebrate the accomplishments and the history of a diverse people.
1.3.8.2.1. Con: The US clearly [opposes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea%E2%80%93United_States_relations) the North Korea regime, therefore the US flag in no way represents tolerance towards such abuses.
1.3.8.2.1.1. Con: North Korean civilians have been oppressed for an extended period of time. There is no end in sight for halting this oppression. The world \(and the US\) are not taking meaningful steps to remediate this and are practicing a policy of containment, tolerating abuse of civilians.
1.3.8.2.1.1.1. Con: Even if the US is not fighting enough to end North Korea's oppressing practices, its flag does not uniquely and clearly represent that, while the Confederate flag is clearly linked to the promotion of slavery and white supremacy.
1.3.8.2.1.1.2. Con: The US shares and upholds political values and international laws regarding national [sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty#Definition_and_types), therefore, other countries are free and have the full right to govern their own territories without unwanted outside interference.
1.3.8.2.2. Con: The accomplishments of Confederates consisted in declaring war towards the Union for the main purpose of keeping African Americans as property, that is not an accomplishment that represents the US today.
1.3.8.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.4.
1.3.8.2.2.2. Pro: Confederacy was established in the Montgomery Convention in 1861 and existed until disintegration in 1865. \(1\) 

Given the short time frame of existence of the Confederacy, it is reasonable to state that there were no accomplishments represented by the Confederate flag outside of the Civil War.

1.3.9. Con: Monuments are just symbols of something that happened in the past, they do not have any more attached meanings. They're objects and only humans can give them power or meaning.
1.3.9.1. Pro: Hate and racism reside inside people, not in a monument. If a monument is taken away, people will find another symbol for it.
1.3.9.2. Pro: These monuments offer a teaching moment for children \(or adults\) who want to learn about the history of America.  These should be given plaques describing what the Confederacy stood for, rather than torn down.
1.3.9.2.1. Con: Plaques that describe that the institution of slavery and white supremacy were what the Confederacy stood for and erecting monuments to those who stood for the Confederacy is a mixed message if we don't want our children \(or adults\) to think that slavery or white supremacy are acceptable.
1.3.9.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.4.
1.3.9.2.1.2. Con: Slavery and white supremacy was what the [KKK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan) stands for, not what the Confederacy stood for. The South stood for states' rights and most Southerners believed that a state should be able to overrule a federal law.
1.3.9.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.6.
1.3.9.2.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.14.
1.3.9.3. Con: At each moment, our morals are known to others by what we make public. Publicly displaying something is tantamount to condoning it, unless otherwise clearly specified.
1.3.9.3.1. Con: Displaying is not condoning. Yes, the people who originally put the monuments up supported what they represented, but the fact that they remain does not mean that we do today. We should use the monuments as a reminder of the morals of the past and why we no longer follow them.
1.3.9.3.1.1. Con: If those who erected the monuments supported slavery and present-day citizens and governments keep publicly displaying those monuments, it is not clear how their display signifies or acts as a reminder that those values are no longer cherished.
1.3.9.3.2. Pro: If the display celebrates the subject, then the display can be interpreted as condoning, even in the current era. Two \(fictional\) examples: an ancient statue of Nero displayed in a corner of a plaza in Rome, at eye level, does not celebrate who he was, but affords an opportunity to reflect on history. In contrast, a statue of Stalin on a 10 meter high pedestal in the center of a roundabout in Moscow indicates that he, or his ideals, are still upheld by society.
1.3.10. Pro: These monuments are a one sided view of history.  We allow confederate monuments to exist and say that from a historical perspective they were adhering to the morals of the time.  What we fail to acknowledge is this is the white perspective, and only one side, as abolitionist societies were formed in the 18th century.  But more importantly we fail to acknowledge that to the blacks of the time slavery was immoral, so by allowing monuments to stand we legitimize one side and de-legitimize another.
1.3.11. Pro: Placing the statues in a museum appropriately addresses these concerns while respecting the values of the USA and those whom were hurt by the actions of those depicted in the statues.
1.3.11.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.
1.3.11.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.
1.3.11.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.
1.3.11.4. Con: There is not a single man, woman, or person of any kind alive today connected to Confederate-era slavery. No one living in the US today suffers from or has suffered from Confederate-era slavery.
1.3.11.4.1. Con: The after effects of the Civil War have lingering effects on people who were not alive during slavery.
1.3.11.4.1.1. Pro: Jim Crow laws specifically targeted the descendants of slaves.
1.3.11.4.1.1.1. Con: Jim Crow laws are only related to the Confederacy to the extent that racism was part of both.
1.3.11.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The [grandfather clause](http://www.blackpast.org/aah/grandfather-clause-1898-1915) restricted the votes of descendants of American slaves.
1.3.11.4.1.2. Pro: Many people believe that the freed slaves in history lacked resources and education, and modern black poverty is influenced by ancestral slavery.
1.3.11.4.1.2.1. Con: [90 percent of wealth doesn't survive the third generation.](https://www.ft.com/content/25a029f6-64f7-11e4-bb43-00144feabdc0)[Most of those who are wealthy earned it in their lifetime.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moneybuilder/2012/04/20/most-wealthy-individuals-earned-not-inherited-their-wealth-2/#32f5c8dd1bac)
1.3.11.4.1.2.2. Pro: [Public schooling with no school choice has kept many poor blacks in under-performing schools for generations](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/Ftrials/conlaw/sepbutequal.htm), [up to and including the present day.](https://www.americanbar.org/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/human_rights_vol38_2011/fall2011/voluntary_desegregation_resegregation_and_the_hope_for_equal_educational_opportunity.html)
1.3.11.4.2. Con: However [modern slavery](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/apr/03/modern-day-slavery-explainer) still exists throughout much of the globe, ranging in type from forced and bonded labor to child slavery and forced prostitution. As such, it is understandable that anything celebrating a previous era of slavery could be divisive since some will interpret it as tolerance of the current era.
1.3.11.4.3. Con: The values in the constitution, loyalty and allegiance to one's own country, do not change. These statues, not slavery, reflect our values. We do not honor failed traitors whose leaders asked for "the state" to have "a right" to continue tyranny against men and women.
1.3.11.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.3.11.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.3.11.4.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.
1.3.11.4.3.4. Con: Nothing in the Constitution prevented States from leaving the Union. The [Declaration of Independence](http://www.crfcelebrateamerica.org/index.php/holidays/4th-of-july/63-declaration-of-independence#2) directly stipulates that it is the right of the people to leave an unjust government.
1.3.11.4.3.4.1. Con: The reason they left was to ensure the continuance of slavery, which was in violation of the constitution itself.
1.3.11.4.3.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.1.
1.3.11.4.3.4.1.2. Con: The 13th Amendment was [signed on February 1, 1865](https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=40) and [the Confederate army surrendered more than 2 months later on April 9th, 1865.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Appomattox_Court_House)
1.3.11.4.3.4.1.3. Pro: The lawyer Lysander Spoon argued as early as 1845 that slavery ran counter to [principles embodied in the constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unconstitutionality_of_Slavery) at the time.
1.3.11.4.3.4.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.3.
1.3.11.4.3.4.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.13.3.1.4.
1.3.11.4.3.4.2. Con: [Article 1, Section 10](https://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec10.html) of the Constitution prevents states from entering a Confederation, or entering agreements with one another without congressional consent.
1.3.11.4.3.4.2.1. Con: In the states' declarations of secession, they claimed to secede from the union before entering into a Confederation. They claimed they were no longer part of the United States.
1.3.11.4.3.4.3. Con: There is no moral right to secede if the principal reason for doing so is to prevent the freedom of people within the state. A state that requires people to give up their freedom is a tyranny.
1.3.11.4.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.2.
1.3.11.4.3.6. Con: The United States killed 750,000 citizens to [allow their tariff collection](http://www.dailyprogress.com/opinion/guest_columnists/protective-tariffs-primary-cause-of-the-civil-war/article_63b77f5c-dc0c-11e2-8e99-001a4bcf6878.html).
1.3.11.4.3.7. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.
1.3.12. Pro: In the words of Confederate Vice President, Alexander Stephens: "\[The Confederacy's\] foundations are laid, its corner-stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition."

The Confederacy lived and died as a treasonous, white supremacist pseudo-nation. US public spaces should not be used for monuments/memorials/symbols that glorify racism and treason.
1.3.13. Pro: This country was built on the blood of many people. The slaughter of Native Americans and the mass slavery of another race are too big to ignore. If we can be honest and realize that America wasn't always the shining beacon on the hill and talk about this issue it will make us better as a country. History isn't written by the honest, it's written by the conquerers.
1.3.14. Pro: When the [South Carolina Articles of Secession](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_scarsec.asp) speak of offenses by the federal government and northern states, they explain that they mean three specific things: \(1\) the election of a President hostile to slavery, \(2\) harboring runaway slaves, and \(3\) intending to abolish slavery completely, by force if necessary.
1.3.15. Pro: While many men, including General Lee, fought more out of a sense of state pride and loyalty, the Confederacy was ultimately created to protect slavery. The Civil War was the end of the abolitionist movement that began before the United States of America was founded. We established that our universal rights were universal. It is up to the states and local governments, but these statues and monuments should be retired to museums. They should be remembered, but they should not be glorified.
1.3.16. Pro: Even if one considers the Confederacy without taking into account the accusations of immorality, it's incredibly anachronistic to glorify people to whom we really can't relate.
1.3.16.1. Pro: By claiming that the Confederacy built America, we are obscuring the truth and delaying the development of our country in the present.
1.3.16.1.1. Pro: America as we know it today was more significantly impacted by the events after WWI, which effectively nullify the positive impacts of the Confederacy.
1.3.16.1.2. Pro: The US is currently undergoing another change \(marriage equality, protests against white supremacy, etc.\) and dwelling on the past only hinders this development.
1.3.17. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.2.3.2.1.1.4.
1.3.18. Pro: Would we continue to display other symbols of xenophobia, racial hatred and national division, such as a Nazi flag, or a burned cross? No, of course not. So why should we continue to display Confederate symbols, that represent slavery, racial violence and division within the United States? There is no logical explanation to continue to display these reminders of a shameful chapter in our country's history.
1.3.19. Con: The truth is that our country failed when it came to slavery and racism \(and still has work to do\). We failed in promoting, enforcing, and carrying out these atrocities that do not reflect morality, virtue, and truth. We must take responsibility for what we have done. Part of this would include pointing to evidence of our failure. An example of failure can be significantly potent when teaching right and wrong.
1.3.20. Pro: The United States erred in not thoroughly vanquishing the traitorous actions, groups, activities, memorials and institutions of The Confederacy. Subsequent Amendments pointedly removed slavery, and now that we agree, to maintain celebratory monuments to traitors amounts to continued damage and intimidation.
1.3.21. Pro: Our streets and squares should be used to promote values that elevate all of us : Respect, Freedom, Peace, Ingenuity, Courage, ...
1.3.22. Pro: Statues of men who willingly fought for slavery, though maybe not the worst of people in general, can be hurtful to those that could have been affected by it. An African American whom walks under or near a Confederate statue would feel much disgust, even if it was over a century ago.
1.3.23. Pro: It will show the Union having a greater victory and that no-one shall go along with slavery and gain pride from it.
1.3.24. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.3.25. Pro: This principle legacy evaluation should be performed in an open and honest way based on the historical record of the commissioning and dedication of each individual monument.
1.3.25.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.1.
1.3.25.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.5.1.1.1.
1.3.25.3. Con: -> See 1.2.12.9.
1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.1.
1.5. Con: These statutes have been around for a very long time and no one has cared. They were uncontested earlier and therewith became a part of our society.
1.5.1. Con: Uncontested does not mean that they were accepted. A lot of people have only found the courage to speak up about them recently yet have taken issue with them for years.
1.5.1.1. Pro: An examination of whose perspectives were considered in the erection of these monuments reveals immense bias towards one side of the Confederacy. This is because African Americans weren't able to exercise their rights, their votes, or their voice in the post-war South as Whites could.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: When Confederate memorials were erected, many Americans were disenfranchised. Therefore it makes sense to reevaluate what we want to celebrate on public property now that formerly disenfranchised groups have a voice in their governments.
1.5.1.1.2. Con: While it is valid to say that the perspectives who built these monuments were biased, it is invalid to say anything regarding what AAs would've done/said in the time that these statues were constructed; because they didn't/couldn't have a say at the time, it is not worth considering what they would've said then.
1.5.1.1.3. Pro: Had African American perspectives been considered fairly, maybe these statues either wouldn't stand or would stand beside abolitionists and heroes of the African American community.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Silence does not necessarily equal consent.  African Americans had good reason to keep their objections to themselves during the Jim Crow era.
1.5.2. Con: Societies change over time, therefore something that was acceptable at a given time may not be acceptable anymore. Therefore, the fact that artifacts have been there for a long time is not a good reason to keep them.
1.5.3. Con: It is necessary for progress to contest issues that were previously uncontested. For example, slavery was itself uncontested for a long time.
1.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.19.
1.5.4. Pro: Hardly anybody pays attention to a statue that has been sitting in a park for forty years. Almost everybody pays attention to a statue that is surrounded by protesters when it is about to be taken down. Progressives have given avowed racists a rallying cry and vast amounts of free publicity by demanding the removal of these monuments by an act of government. It would have been better to file an initiative petition and remove them by a majority vote on a secret ballot.
1.5.4.1. Con: It is better for the people of a country to be aware of their country's racists than for those racists to be able to slip by unnoticed.
1.5.5. Con: -> See 1.2.6.3.
1.5.6. Pro: Removing monuments almost always ends up being permanent, while the atmosphere driving the removal is fleeting.
1.5.6.1. Con: It's not possible to say with any certainty that the current atmosphere is fleeting.
1.5.6.2. Con: No one is saying to remove the monuments because of current fervor.  There are strong normative ethical claims being made for removing the statues that have to be dealt with.  These have to be dealt with.
1.5.6.3. Con: Most arguments in favor of wanting the monuments removed suggest it is a good thing to remove the statues permanently.
1.5.6.4. Con: The protest has succeeded if the protesters no longer feel the need to protest. So if the atmosphere driving the removal is fleeting, then that would be a good thing. It's one step closer to a racism-free world.
1.5.6.5. Con: The fact that the public has a short attention span and quickly moves on the other topics can hardly be an argument for or against a position. Otherwise, this would justify many other evils, for example the [abuses in Abu Ghraib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse).
1.5.6.6. Pro: A civilization that wants to be great and durable can't give in so easily to the whims of a few agitators.
1.5.6.6.1. Con: Although the majority of Americans seem to support keeping the monuments, [27% advocate to remove](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/21/polls-shows-majority-of-americans-think-confederate-statues-should-remain) them from public spaces and 19% are not sure, according to polls, therefore a large number of the American population, while not a majority, does not constitute “few agitators”.
1.5.7. Con: Few people in the south cared that Blacks couldn't use the same water fountain as whites for a very long time. That doesn't make a case that they should have continued doing that.
1.5.7.1. Pro: In fact, [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States) itself was practiced in North American European Settlements over 100 years longer than it has been abolished.
1.5.7.2. Con: Flags and monuments are not the same as active discrimination
1.5.8. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.
1.5.9. Con: This is generally known as the [Historian's Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian%27s_fallacy) - One cannot assume that decision makers of the past viewed events from the same perspective and having the same information as those subsequently analyzing the decision.
1.5.10. Con: This is untrue as they were contested and people did care. For example, W.E.B. DuBois' excellent essays on the legacy of Robert E. Lee and Confederate Monuments which you can find here: [cwmemory.com](http://cwmemory.com/2017/05/30/w-e-b-dubois-on-robert-e-lee/)
1.5.10.1. Con: Each suggested statue removal, usually carried out in city council meetings, is an opportunity for a community to hear from both those who care for the statues, and those who don't care for them.
1.5.11. Con: -> See 1.2.10.1.2.
1.5.12. Con: Even if the statues have been around a long time, and with little public dissent, since January of 2017, increasing agitation by neo-Nazis has added an insistent endorsement of the worst possible interpretations of the statues' various meanings.
1.6. Pro: The Confederates committed treason against the United States. The United States should not continue to honor or memorialize them.
1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.1.
1.6.3. Pro: [President Andrew Johnson pardoned all confederates for Treason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardons_for_ex-Confederates), suggesting that all confederates had in fact committed treason \(otherwise they would not need to be pardoned\)
1.6.3.1. Con: People are not punished for crimes they have been pardoned for; that is the point of a pardon.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: The removal of statues is not punishment in any meaningful sense, as the Confederates in question are long-dead.
1.6.3.1.2. Con: We don't formally punish people for crimes they've been pardoned for, but we don't celebrate them for it either.
1.6.4. Con: [President Andrew Johnson pardoned all confederates for Treason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardons_for_ex-Confederates), restoring all of their rights under the Constitution.
1.6.4.1. Con: A pardon restores rights, but not honor.
1.6.4.2. Con: A pardon is also an admission of guilt on the part of the pardoned. An admission to treason. While their rights were restored, their actions continue to be infamous, and not worthy of praise. And that praise is one framed in a message of White Supremacy over African-Americans.

In short, these statues serve as a reminder of treason in the support of White Supremacy, and no other purpose. They are not simply remembrances; they are reinforcements of the notion that man is not created equal.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.6.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.6.4.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.1.
1.6.5. Con: There are numerous [secession](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/13/secession-movements-in-us-gaining-steam/) movements today, most prominently [Calexit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_California#By_opponents). Even if these states left the union, they would be part of US history, and thus the remaining United States would continue to memorialize and honor their contributions.
1.6.5.1. Con: While the first part is correct, it seems unlikely that should California choose to secede the rest of the country would memorialize that event, as it would effectively lead to the weakening of everyone else, much like Mexico might look at Texas.
1.6.5.2. Con: The difference lies in whether there is/was a war fought over the secession.
1.6.5.3. Pro: Confederacy was created for white supremacy and slavery. This is true. However It is also the only time that states have invoked the right to secede the federal government and thus  their independence.
1.6.5.4. Con: California's succession is not based on the desire to continue to own other people as property and the right to abuse them. This is the key element of the confederacy that is so immoral and why they should not be commemorated. The group of people who were facing this abuse still live here and still face the racism that was the root of the slavery movement.
1.6.5.5. Con: The Confederacy's first and only contribution to the United States was declaring war against it, an act hardly worth commemorating.[historyplace.com](http://www.historyplace.com/civilwar/)
1.6.5.6. Con: The contributions are not limited to honoring partisans that fought for secession, or who exemplified the purpose: slavery.
1.6.6. Con: -> See 1.3.11.4.3.4.
1.6.7. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.
1.6.8. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.6.9. Pro: How can modern Americans praise traitors to our founding fathers? The Confederates wanted to create a new country. They committed treason. That is an insult to have memorials of traitors in the public sphere.
1.6.9.1. Con: -> See 1.3.11.4.3.4.
1.6.9.2. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.6.9.3. Con: The level of independent self-determination desired by the Southern states is not necessarily out of line with the structures and policies established in the Constitution.
1.6.9.4. Con: The signers of the Declaration of Independence were also considered traitors by the British. Having their statutes in public doesn't represent an insult to the British either.
1.6.9.4.1. Con: 'The signers of the Declaration of Independence were considered patriots here in the United States, the United States happened to win that war with Britain. Therefore the British don't have the right to be insulted by our statues, also these statues aren't in Britain, they're in the United States. The Confederacy lost the war, unlike the previously mentioned situation. [Therefore the Confederacy doesn't have a right to have statues honoring their defeated army's members. Losers can't pick.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_makes_right)
1.6.9.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.6.9.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.1.
1.6.9.4.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.
1.6.9.4.2. Con: Indeed they were traitors to the crown. However, they won that war, and formed the US. Much later, the US [reconciled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom%E2%80%93United_States_relations) with England, and the two nations are allies today. By contrast The Confederate States of America was never recognized by any other nation, and ceased to exist upon their defeat. The comparison is, therefore, extremely weak.
1.6.9.4.2.1. Con: Britain and France granted the Confederate States of America belligerent status which allowed trade for arms and other supplies.
1.6.9.4.3. Con: The United States should not honor those who committed treason by taking up arms against it, in any form, in any way. That’s why there aren’t statues of George Washington in London.
1.6.9.4.4. Con: There are no current parts of England that were formerly the US. So there can be no comparison between monuments to the American Revolution, which was won by those who would form the US, and The Confederacy, which The Confederacy lost.
1.6.9.4.5. Con: Committing a traitorous act may not be sufficient to judge a person as unworthy of honor, but it is sufficient reason for the country which was betrayed not to honor them.
1.6.9.4.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.6.9.4.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.
1.6.9.4.5.3. Con: -> See 1.3.11.4.3.4.
1.6.9.4.5.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.
1.6.9.5. Con: Robert E. Lee \(like most Confederate Generals who survived to the end of the war\) was [pardoned and restored](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=72360) as US citizen.
1.6.9.5.1. Con: Being pardoned of a crime does not erase the crime but is simply an act of clemency. Lee and other confederate leaders still committed treason.
1.6.9.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.1.
1.6.9.5.1.2. Con: When South Africa worked through its history of abuse, racism, and violence, it created a [Truth and Reconciliation Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_\(South_Africa\)). This commission was to balance both justice for those who had been wronged and grant amnesty to perpetrators of human rights violations under apartheid where such actions were sometimes legal.

Continuing to call those who fought against the Union traitors does not bring healing to the nation, it divides it.
1.6.9.5.1.2.1. Con: South Africa still has significant problems with [racism](https://qz.com/867927/social-media-rants-reveal-the-enduring-racism-of-post-apartheid-south-africa/) and [racially-motivated](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/19/charlottesville-stellenbosch-south-africa-racism-history) [violence](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37998607); thus it could be argued that granting amnesty to perpetrators of humans rights violations is less likely to heal a nation.
1.6.9.5.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.4.1.
1.6.9.5.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.
1.6.10. Pro: In light of so many supporting respect towards the American flag and what it stands for, it is only appropriate to remove taxpayer-funded statues of traitors.
1.6.11. Pro: We do not honor people who lost in wars, history is decided by the victors. The victors were the United States \(Union\), the losers were the Rebels \(Confederacy\).
1.6.11.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.6.11.2. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.1.
1.6.12. Pro: A good compromise would be to remove memorials of Confederate generals, while leaving monuments that honor soldiers on both sides and grave sites should remain in place.
1.6.12.1. Pro: We celebrate our soldiers for their brave and unyielding sacrifice during times of war.  The statues and symbols of the Civil War are just that and nothing more.  Let us not forget that the Civil War was fought in the USA and as such there were Americans on both sides who died.  Also, it is a reminder that freedom won over the awful practice of slavery and that it was worth fighting for and dying for.
1.6.12.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.6.13. Con: The United States officially recognizes soldiers in the Confederacy as US veterans under the law, [as shown here.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/2306)
1.6.13.1. Con: This would likely be implemented to prevent more divisive sentiment, and spare the suffering of many people who were brothers, cousins and friends by legitimizing their struggle. This does not re-define what they did as not treasonous.
1.6.14. Con: In all the history of mankind no conqueror has ever written kind narratives about the people they vanquished. It is no surprise that the subdued Confederacy has been demonized to such a degree. After all they dare exercise Constitutional muscle in the face of an ever growing, self-centralizing government. It is unique, however, that the children of such conquered people be allowed to defend & tell the story of their fathers in a manner not influenced by the very government who subjected them.
1.6.15. Pro: A preponderance of Confederate icons in key public locations does not distinguish the Confederacy and subsequent sympathizers from the current state.
1.6.16. Pro: The Confederates are a part of American History as the[David Koresh](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Koresh) is. They led a movement that led to [620,000](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/civil-war-casualties) American deaths for a cause \(slavery\) that was morally wrong. Why would we raise statues for people that led an insurrection against the U.S. Government? This is treasonous.
1.6.17. Pro: The Confederate States of America was a separate, sovereign nation and belligerent to the United States of America. Would you fly the flag of Japan over the South Carolina capitol building? There is also scant difference between erecting a monument to Robert E. Lee and doing the same for Erwin Rommel.
1.6.17.1. Con: The Conferacy was indeed a foreign and separate nation, and South Carolina was part of it. Japan or Nazi Germany are foreign countries to South Carolina, the Confederacy is not
1.6.18. Pro: In no other society in the world are history's villains or traitors revered or held in the same esteem as that nation's heroes.  For example, Benedict Arnold was an important part of early American history. However, there is no statue of him because he was a traitor and yet people know who is he without one.  Yes, the Civil War and the Confederacy are a part of American History but they should be taught in and learned about in school or in a museum, not misrepresented as heroes with statues
1.6.18.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.1.

1.6.19. Con: Not all confederate monuments honor the act or cause of this treason.
1.6.19.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.6.19.2. Con: Confederate political and military leaders are the embodiment of treason. They conspired and led it.
1.6.19.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.4.
1.6.19.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.
1.6.19.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.19.5.2.2.
1.6.20. Pro: Public confederate flags should be removed since they do not represent our current allegiance.
1.6.21. Con: The monuments were erected by states and/or localities, not by the federal government. Thus, the United States, as a political entity, never has honored these Confederates.
1.6.21.1. Con: Many of the monuments are on federal property. For example in the Rotunda of the Capitol and in federal parks in Washington, D.C.
1.6.21.2. Con: This is still treasonous by whoever erected the monuments.
1.6.21.3. Con: In our system of federalism, states and localities are still under the federal government, not entirely separate from it. It still represents a government endorsement of treason.
1.6.22. Pro: Confederate soldiers, like Robert E Lee, tried to destroy the Union, fired on US forts, and started armed insurrection. Honoring these men honors people that wanted to destroy this country. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson worked to build this country. Andrew Jackson, for example, kept SC from seceding over an import duty and fought in the war of 1812. There is a difference from being flawed and leading insurrection.
1.6.22.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.
1.6.22.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.2.
1.6.22.3. Con: The whole point of the work that George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Andrew Jackson did was to protect the people against an unjust government. The way this is guaranteed is through the right to leave that government should the people see it as unjust. This is exactly what they themselves did with England. "When fighting broke out in 1775, American revolutionaries determined that separation was the only means of obtaining liberty and justice."[civilwar.org](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/american-revolution-faqs)
1.6.22.4. Con: The goal of the South in the Civil War was never the destruction of the United States, but rather to secure independence for the Confederacy and freedom from the political oppression of the North.
1.6.22.5. Con: While the Confederacy firing on Fort Sumter did initiate the hostilities of the Civil War, Union forces in the region were given almost four months to evacuate.  Union forces not only refused to evacuate the fort which lay within South Carolina's territory, but also attempted to reinforce and resupply the fort.  It was within the rights of the Confederacy to violently expel Union forces from its territory.
1.6.23. Pro: Even when we honor the accomplishments of Benedict Arnold, a famous American traitor, the monument to his memory does not bear his [name](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boot-monument) and fails to even [honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_Monument) him as a whole person.
1.6.24. Con: Monuments, statues, and other forms of art and expression could be viewed as a remembrance of what Confederates stood for and that they lost. For example, General Lee fought against the Union and lost.
1.6.24.1. Con: Whatever one's interpretation of the objects in question may be, nobody is debating the presence of monuments and memorials that point out the Confederate leaders' defeat as their primary feature.
1.6.24.1.1. Con: Most monuments depict a man, not showing victory or defeat. People are attaching their own meanings to these monuments and then claim it is their "primary feature."
1.6.24.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.1.
1.6.24.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.
1.6.24.2. Con: Monuments are placed in public places to honor people, not to hold them up as bad examples.  No one would put a statue of Timothy McVeigh or Charles Manson in a park to provide moral instruction on how NOT to behave.
1.6.24.2.1. Con: Museums, Libraries, art galleries all have examples of bad times in human history. No one is suggesting, yet, that any of these examples are removed.
1.6.24.2.1.1. Con: Museums, libraries and art galleries tend to memorialise history in a more objective way which focuses on learning. Statues and public memorials are akin to celebrations.
1.6.24.2.1.1.1. Con: Museums are not immune from bias.
1.6.24.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: British theorist Stuart Hall analyzed how museum exhibitions are often biased, and looked at the differences between how various groups of people are [represented](https://msu.edu/course/ams/280/represent.html) there.
1.6.24.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.18.5.2.2.
1.7. Pro: The statues can be kept without glorifying what they once stood for. They can be kept in museums with proper historical context rather than on a plinth to be admired.
1.7.1. Con: It is impossible to establish who has the authority to determine what parts of history "deserve" to be seen, and further, to determine for everyone what "parts" of history are interpreted as meaningfully connected to an object, and even further, which "group" is most deserving of having their interpretation valued.
1.7.1.1. Con: Slavery was a universal evil. Universal evils should not be celebrated. Publicly displaying monuments to those who committed or supported atrocities is morally indefensible.
1.7.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.13.13.
1.7.1.3. Con: This applies just as easily to the erecting and preservation of monuments as it does to the removal of them.
1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.1.
1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.
1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.
1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.
1.7.6. Pro: Although the statues mark an important part of history, their upkeep is paid for by taxpayers. If African Americans don't want to pay their money for the upkeep of statues that glorify those who would keep them in change, it's better to move the statues to a museum where they can properly be a piece of history.
1.7.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.2.
1.7.6.2. Pro: Placing statues on federal or state property seems like a conflict of interest. The state using tax money to endorse historical figures and ideas should instead be left to private citizens and organizations. Let people build whatever they feel like on their property and have the government remain as neutral as possible lest they be accused of "rewriting history".
1.7.7. Con: Confederate monuments should stand as reminder that the wealth accrued to the United States as a whole, the North specifically, as result of the acquisition of and trade in slaves remains to be distributed to those whose relations were exploited to create much of the foundational wealth of U.S. corporatism.
1.7.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.7.7.2. Con: -> See 1.3.11.4.1.2.1.
1.7.8. Pro: The movement of these statues to museums allow historians to contextualize and historicize why these statues exist and who these people were. It will also reduce cost on local government to maintain these statues by moving them to private institutions
1.7.8.1. Pro: A historical contextualization of Confederate statues will inform the public and ensure that these figures are remembered but not necessarily revered. Furthermore, it will highlight the racist motivations behind the creation and installment of such statues.
1.7.8.2. Pro: Transferring such statues to private institutions like museums is financially smart because local governments will not have to spend precious tax dollars on maintenance and museums can profit and subsequently reinvest in the local community.
1.7.8.3. Pro: Further, it will remove the implied government endorsement of the ideals of those monuments.  These monuments should be preserved, because, for better or worse, they're part of our history.  However, using the tax dollars of the people—particularly the very people that were oppressed by the confederacy—would seem to rub salt in a still-open wound.
1.7.9. Pro: Public art of famous figures provide role models to future generations, we do not wish children to model themselves on these people.
1.7.9.1. Con: This claim gives no reasons why we would not want our children to model themselves after these people. Simply being on the wrong side. It is not currently a very popular view, but a close study of Robert E. Lee gives much worth patterning oneself after. This is one of the reasons why President Lincoln offered him command of the Army first.
1.7.9.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.5.2.2.
1.7.9.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.5.2.2.9.3.
1.7.9.2. Pro: Having the statues implicitly teaches the public that the confederacy was full of great people, who did great things, and are worth celebrating. It was not. Young people who are not ready for the nuance of extended history lessons will not see past the grand nature of the statue to learn of it as a symbol of oppression, especially if they are white and don't necessarily have a feeling of that oppression to connect the statue with.
1.7.9.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.
1.7.9.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.4.
1.7.9.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.1.
1.7.9.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.
1.7.9.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.4.
1.7.9.5. Pro: Context is key. Right now, monuments stand to those who rose up against their country and fought for slavery, alongside and without differentiation from monuments to those who truly served our Republic for just and honorable, even noble causes. If confederate monuments were to be kept, they would need to be properly contextualized such that they would not be mistaken as honorable symbols.
1.7.9.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.
1.7.9.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.7.9.5.3. Con: By this same standard, it would it be appropriate to "properly contextualize" the Statue of Liberty with plaques from those opposed to immigration.
1.7.9.6. Pro: Memorializing is reserved for people who are well thought of.  No one memorializes those they hate.
1.7.9.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.6.
1.7.10. Pro: Monuments and other forms of art are used in public spaces very frequently as symbols of common values shared by the public that funds them.
1.7.10.1. Pro: Historical monuments who no longer share the common values of the public should belong in a space where history exists for history's sake, such as a museum
1.7.10.2. Con: Common values are arguably varied and up to constant discussion
1.7.11. Con: Historic landmarks, even statues, are not a glorification of history even if they were put up for that purpose. They are memories of history, they are kept up to remind us of what people once glorified, not any indication that we still do glorify them.
1.7.11.1. Con: If the monuments were put up for the purpose of glorification of history, then they are a glorification of history.
1.7.11.1.1. Pro: George Washington, as a person, doesn't live up to our moral standards, but he represents our freedom from England. Confederate statues, on the other hand, represent the Confederacy. The Confederacy does not deserve to be memorialized.
1.7.11.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.7.11.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.
1.7.11.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.4.2.
1.7.11.1.1.4. Con: The Confederacy fought for States' Rights, one of which was to decide for themselves on slavery which is what becomes the focus. But without that fight and hardline stance, states may not have the freedom to decide things like allowing gay marriage when it conflicts with Federal Law. Oddly enough, the ideal that the Confederacy fought for is one most still agree with, and is helping to protect progressive freedoms today.
1.7.11.1.1.4.1. Con: The Confederacy lost that war, and only seemed to want to keep states rights [to maintain slavery as an institution.](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/reasons-secession) The former confederate states cannot, then, claim any moral authority for the equal protections added to the constitution after they seceded.
1.7.11.1.1.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.7.11.2. Con: The subjects of statues don't have to live up to modern moral standards, but what they represent should live up to those standards.
1.7.11.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.4.
1.7.11.3. Con: An item can be both a memory of history and a statement of honor. It is a false dichotomy to say it must be treated as one but not the other.
1.7.11.4. Con: All human artifacts are memories of history. That fact alone is not enough to justify keeping such artifact where it is. Otherwise we would never renovate buildings.
1.7.11.5. Con: Many of the monuments do not memorialize any particular thing that happened. There are statues in many locations that do not represent a historical fact or occurrence relative to their location or the person depicted.
1.7.11.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.
1.7.11.5.2. Pro: The Confederate Soldiers Memorial in Athens Alabama at Limestone County Courthouse commemorates no event other than the confederacy itself, and the period of the civil war. [etd.auburn.edu](https://etd.auburn.edu/bitstream/handle/10415/1118/Davis_Michael_44.pdf?sequence=1) p.107
1.7.11.5.3. Pro: Monuments that do commemorate actual happenings are less controversial and have not been suggested as targets for removal, such as the plaque near Tucson Arizona [commemorating the battle of Picacho Pass.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Picacho_Pass#Gallery)
1.7.11.5.4. Pro: [The Star City ​Confederate Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_City_Confederate_Memorial) has inscriptions on all sides, none of which commemorate anything except the confederacy and the monument itself.
1.7.11.6. Pro: If we removed all statues from an era that didn't live up to modern moral standards we would have no historic landmarks of any kind. Much of history was awful, that is not a reason to destroy it.
1.7.11.7. Con: -> See 1.3.9.3.
1.7.11.8. Con: -> See 1.3.11.
1.7.11.9. Con: [The Confederate Last Stand](http://arkansastoothpick.com/laststand.jpg) monument near Little Rock, Arkansas, rededicated just a few years ago in 2013, still claims Confederate soldiers as "ours" and exhalts a Confederate spy as a hero. Upon rededication, the tone could be changed to acknowledge that the spy was a traitor to the country the monument now stands in.
1.7.11.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.7.11.9.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.4.1.
1.7.11.10. Con: -> See 1.2.13.9.3.4.
1.7.12. Pro: Belgium is a perfect model for this. Their [handling](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4235237.stm) of Leopold-Era statues related to the mistreatment of people in the Congo is something America could replicate.
1.7.13. Pro: The timing and the periods of history when these monuments where put in public spaces, as well as the increase in the number of public schools named after some confederate soldiers, shows that the purpose of them is to infringe fear and keep alive the idea that people of color are inferior and should never be treated as equals. There's no historical context when children see them. No one explains them that those men fought for the wrong cause.
1.7.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.9.2.1.
1.7.14. Pro: Speaking from an economical part of view, this would make government management of the statues much better--- government saving money for better things, such as better education.
1.7.15. Pro: History should shine in museums where the full picture can be painted without bias or a limitation on space \(i.e. when a single statue is erected representing one side of a story\).
1.7.15.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.
1.7.15.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.

1.7.15.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.19.5.2.4.2.4.
1.7.15.7. Pro: Statues small enough to fit in a museum should be placed in an area representative of the times \(the hardships endured by Blacks\) and preserved as a way to show that this should never happen again.
1.7.15.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.
1.7.15.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.
1.7.15.7.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.
1.7.15.8. Con: Space limitations also exist in museums.
1.7.15.9. Pro: The intent of the war and the part played by the Confederates is oftentimes forgotten. Putting these memorials into museums would allow the context necessary to tell the whole story of their historical  background.
1.7.15.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.4.
1.7.15.9.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.

1.7.15.9.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.
1.7.15.10. Pro: Leaving flags in a public space does not teach history in any meaningful way.
1.7.15.10.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.7.15.10.2. Con: Whether it's racist to fly or not, every flag represents a different cultural ancestry and shared history. It's arguably a form of racism to deny people their culture in America.
1.7.15.10.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.
1.7.15.10.3. Pro: Most people do not know the [meaning of most historical flags](http://www.loeser.us/flags/protest2.html).
1.7.16. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.5.2.
1.7.17. Pro: There are plenty of places where these controversial statues can be displayed, such as in battlefield parks and historic sites that are all across the south.
1.7.17.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.2.
1.7.17.2. Pro: There should be places where, as history and personal sentiment may offer value, artifacts and statues should be protectively displayed. They should not be imposed or have an implicit endorsement as is now the case with Confederate statues in civic squares and the like.
1.8. Con: Removal is the most drastic measure when there are more gentle alternatives.
1.8.1. Pro: Erecting additional monuments next to existing ones honoring the victims and telling their story adds to historic content.
1.8.1.1. Con: Leaving monuments to confederate generals while erecting monuments to the ones who suffer from their actions is not a better solution, it is socially and morally ambiguous. You can't glorify or commemorate both the victims and the ones who enslaved and killed them.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.7.11.
1.8.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.8.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.8.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.
1.8.1.1.5. Con: You can leave existing monuments and modify them in a way that takes away the glorification of the ones who enslaved.
1.8.1.2. Con: In practice this rarely if ever occurs, and is impractical in many situations.
1.8.1.2.1. Con: The idea is to make this occur more often. Additionally, the fact that this occurs rarely at the moment, is not a reason not to do so, only a current fact.
1.8.1.2.2. Pro: Erecting additional monuments or altering existing ones may in many cases be more costly than removing them.
1.8.1.3. Pro: For example, erecting a [Frederick Douglass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass) statue close to [Robert E. Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee) so visitors and bystanders would see both.
1.8.1.3.1. Con: A museum is a more efficient, clear and decisive stand for the values of the subject. Here it is regarding slavery, secession, and the values of those represented and the venue which hosts them.
1.8.1.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.
1.8.1.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.
1.8.1.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.
1.8.1.3.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.4.
1.8.1.3.1.5. Pro: If monuments were in a museum or similar setting, with the full context of how and why they were originally placed detailed and explained, it would allow interested parties to more fully understand them.
1.8.1.4. Pro: It would be quite appropriate to put another statue of Martin Luther King standing taller than Robert E Lee, looking over him - reminding everyone that Robert E Lee was part of American story, but his ideology is dwarfed by what happened later.
1.8.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.4.
1.8.1.4.2. Con: Putting Robert E. Lee in a museum is more appropriate. The interaction of these statues to safeguard the Confederate legacy is not a solution, but creates more confusion and drama. This would be better suited in a museum, not in front of municipal buildings which should send a decisive and clear message of our core values.
1.8.1.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.
1.8.1.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.

1.8.1.4.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.4.
1.8.1.4.2.6. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.4.
1.8.1.5. Pro: Modifications or new statues would accurately represent how history transpired, leaving no stand-alone monument the lesser.
1.8.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.2.
1.8.3. Con: There are more drastic measures possible. Demolition is one. Desecration is another. Removal to some other site is gentle enough.
1.8.4. Pro: This wouldn't happen if the monuments were privatized. Instead of having them on public land, they could be auctioned to people who want to keep them, or destroyed if no one wants them.
1.8.4.1. Con: There is a privatized [memorial](https://patch.com/washington/seattle/confederate-flag-flies-washington-its-caretaker-explains-why) to Jefferson Davis in Washington state that has become a veritable shrine to the Confederacy. It is visible from the interstate and leaves the impression that this town caters to white supremacists. This solution has had very poor consequences.
1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.6.
1.8.6. Con: Being gentle is not necessary when it comes to symbols of slavery, white supremacy, treason, and hatred.
1.8.6.1. Con: Hatred is only perceived as such due to the war. Had the war not happened, and the secession gone clean cut for everyone, the idea of hatred might not have subsisted more than a couple of years
1.8.6.1.1. Con: One may argue that Confederate monuments embody hate as they promote the message that some humans are inferior and should be treated as property, regardless of the war.
1.8.6.1.2. Con: To think that the symbol of hatred stems from the war mischaracterizes why they are regarded as monuments to hatred. The Confederacy would have been treasonous and embodied white supremacy and race-based slavery irrespective of whether it had gone to war with the Union.
1.8.6.2. Con: -> See 1.6.9.4.
1.8.7. Pro: Modifying existing memorials and monuments would symbolically express that history is not erased from public spaces but rather that the attitudes of the past have been overcome and replaced by something new.
1.8.7.1. Pro: Removing the statues eliminates the opportunity for them to be mocked. Instead, we should exempt them from protection against vandalism and showcase them as an expression of art.
1.8.7.1.1. Pro: A beheaded statue of dictator Franco, as part of a larger exhibition meant to question his rule’s legitimacy and legacy,  was the target of incredible [vandalism](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/world/europe/franco-statue-barcelona-spain.html) as the public expressed their opposition. Local authorities had to finally remove it.
1.8.7.2. Pro: One example for how existing structures can be re-interpreted is the [Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation_Center_Nazi_Party_Rally_Grounds) in Nuremberg. It preserved existing architecture from the Nazi era but speared through it with glass and steel elements, thus "transforming a symbol of a dreaded past into a structure of a critical memory", as the jury of the [Int. Architecture Exhibition](http://artdaily.com/news/10913/Official-Awards-of-the-9th-Intl--Architecture-Exhibition) put it.
1.8.7.2.1. Con: The area in question in Nuremberg was converted into a museum. It is not a mere decoration to a municipal building or common site. This argument exemplifies its opposing viewpoint: "Put the statues in a museum"
1.8.7.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.
1.8.7.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.
1.8.7.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.
1.8.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.1.
1.8.7.4. Pro: A town in [Italy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/06/bolzano-italian-town-defuse-controversial-monuments) opened a contest to “defuse and contextualize” a Mussolini monument and received more than 500 proposals. Finally, the monument is still standing but reinterpreted with a Hannah Arendt quote: “Nobody has the right to obey".
1.8.7.5. Pro: Many of these memorials and monuments include engraved text of events honoring a specific viewpoint of history. Creating additional engraved content can explain and cater to a more modern day perspective of past events without hiding its initial symbolism.
1.8.7.5.1. Pro: An alternative of keeping monuments but adding plaques or new art pieces beside them would show the context of the monuments, and the contrast with modern values. It would be art in context rather than all in museum which is important for the local community’s living history. It would also show that past people can be both good and bad at the same time, by remembering the racism can be committed by otherwise moral people.
1.8.7.5.2. Con: The message on the plaque is usually overshadowed by the image of glory that the statue itself presents. As such, these plaques tend to go unnoticed in public places; however if the statues were relocated to museums then there would likely be more attention placed on the accompanying plaques.
1.8.7.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.
1.8.7.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.
1.8.7.5.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.8.7.5.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.
1.8.7.5.2.5. Con: If statues representing those who survived the oppression of the war and slavery were added into the monuments then the text would not be overshadowed, rather the new statues would overshadow the old in showing how far we have come.
1.8.7.5.3. Pro: Engraved content needs to be added to all and any monuments where those living in the area have a negative reaction to the contents of the Statuary.
1.8.7.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.1.
1.8.7.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.
1.8.7.5.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.2.
1.8.7.6. Pro: Removal is the weakest option, when there are much stronger alternatives: leave the statues in public, and use transcriptions/art/etc. to shame them publicly with the great bright light of morality
1.8.7.7. Pro: Confederate monuments could be replaced with monuments like [The Emancipation Statue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bussa_Emancipation_Statue) in Barbados, which is documenting the freedom from slavery in Barbados. Because slavery is a part of American history as well as Confederacy and should be documented in the same way Confederate generals are.
1.8.7.7.1. Con: Replacing requires the tearing down of that which is being replaced.
1.8.7.8. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.5.
1.8.8. Con: It's safe to say destroying the monuments is more drastic than caring for them in a museum dedicated to their preservation, so the modality is off. Further, this doesn't explain why more moderate measures should be adopted, instead only stating that these alternatives exist. Thus, even if the premises were true, they would fail to provide the evidence needed to arrive at the conclusion.
1.8.9. Pro: Confederate monuments are large and expensive to remove. While a flag can be easily taken down, a monument is harder to obscure/remove.
1.8.9.1. Pro: Instead, large memorials such as [Stone Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Mountain) in Georgia should be changed to exhibit-parks that treat them as relics of a different time, and still condemn what they stand for, rather than celebrations of a racist history. Smaller memorials belong in museums.
1.8.10. Pro: Keep them. With some tweaks, of course. Next to a statue of Robert E. Lee, usually depicted on a horse like some conquering hero, maybe another one celebrating Lee surrendering to Grant. One of Jefferson Davis? Add one showing him in chains like he was at Ft Monroe after the war.
1.8.11. Pro: The [money spent tearing down monuments](http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/removal-of-lee-jackson-statues-could-cost-charlottesville/article_3b328d33-2f05-5efe-b1e7-9650164522f4.html) would be better put directly towards educating citizens on the reasons they are there in the first place.
1.8.11.1. Con: Destruction is almost always cheaper than thoughtful creation.
1.8.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.7.2.
1.8.11.1.2. Con: The inexpensive nature of destruction does not legitimize destruction as a tool, especially over political ideologies and its iconography.
1.8.11.2. Con: A museum will better educate without sanctifying the ideals of the statues. A statue is erected in honor \(not derision\) of the subject, especially when in a public venue like a state house, court house, or other municipal building.
1.8.11.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.
1.8.11.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.
1.8.11.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.
1.8.12. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.
1.8.13. Con: There is no way to "gently" change a statue celebrating Robert E. Lee. As long as he and what he fought for are depicted in a public place, it celebrates the oppression of African Americans.
1.8.13.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.8.14. Pro: Divisive tools used to combat divisive ideals only legitimizes divisiveness.
1.8.14.1. Con: This is false. It is possible to use such a tool to remove a more divisive icon. In such cases, like the Confederate monument debate, this action legitimizes a selective kind of controversial action in this context, and not merely divisiveness in general.
1.8.14.2. Con: This wrongly equates the kind of division in the tool and ideal. These monuments reinforce racial divisions because their characters legitimized racism. The division they engendered has to do with race and equality. Removing monuments, changing them, or adding new ones to supplement them would legitimize heterogeneity and equality. Legitimizing racism is a legitimate source of division. Delegitimizing racism and legitimizing equality is not a legitimate source of division.
1.8.15. Pro: -> See 1.7.17.
1.9. Pro: Public money should not be used to fund monuments that honour slavery
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.
1.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.2.
1.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.10.
1.9.5. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.
1.9.6. Pro: Publicly funded and maintained places are not suitable for statues, flags, or other memorabilia that would in any way\(perceived or not\) glorify, or show reverence to, a period of time in which one group of Americans were treated as inferior to another group of Americans. This demeans the core principles of liberty and being an American.
1.9.7. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.2.
1.9.8. Con: -> See 1.8.11.
1.9.9. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.10. Pro: It is too divisive in modern day America to continue to display these monuments from a painful part of American history.
1.10.1. Con: The statues as inanimate objects are not offensive, the people protesting are making them offensive.  What they are protesting is like saying a gun goes looking for people to shoot.  Guns don't go looking for people to shoot, people do.
1.10.2. Pro: Keeping these monuments divides the country by alienating minorities.
1.10.2.1. Pro: Having a Confederate monument on official public property suggests that this is the Government's speech. This can create a perception of institutional bigotry to alienate African Americans.
1.10.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.
1.10.2.1.2. Pro: Imagine as a black kid you leave your house, walk down Robert E. Lee Drive, past a confederate flag outside the courthouse, past a statue of Stonewall Jackson, to Jefferson Davis High School. This would make you question whether you could trust a police officer in a community that adorns its public spaces with monuments to people who advocated the continued enslavement of your people as well as whether you could trust your teachers when your school is named after those figures.
1.10.2.1.3. Pro: Having confederate values displayed on/in buildings or sites with owned by the United States government is inappropriate.
1.10.2.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.10.2.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.1.
1.10.2.1.3.3. Pro: The purpose of a monument is to commemorate the actions and accomplishments of an individual. When the accomplishments and actions of the individual being commemorated are linked to the oppression and abuse of a group of citizens living in the community where the statue resides, it is a slap in the face to those citizens.
1.10.2.2. Pro: The confederate statues are a constant reminder of slavery to Blacks in this country.
1.10.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.10.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.4.
1.10.2.2.3. Con: All white people are a constant reminder of slavery to Blacks in this country.
1.10.2.2.4. Pro: Given that black people in Southern states continue to experience racism, the veneration of Confederate statues is a passive threat of violence and oppression. Conversely, removing them symbolizes a rejection of racism, thus signaling that their local governments intend to make amends for the mistakes of the past.
1.10.2.2.5. Pro: Having a statue of a leader of a rebellion against the current standing government is very difficult to explain to a child. It can be detrimental because some will believe that physical acts of violence are the way to go when you don't get your way in America
1.10.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.4.
1.10.2.4. Con: History should not be subject to this kind of emotional selection. If so, every statue should be torn down. There is no human in history that was loved by all.
1.10.2.4.1. Con: It is historically significant when oppressive symbols are torn down. Consider [Saddam Hussein's statue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWxszYK6IPU) being torn down. The situation we are discussing is less dramatic but no less significant.
1.10.2.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.19.5.5.
1.10.2.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.2.1.2.1.
1.10.2.4.2. Pro: Removing any symbol however crude increases cultural sensitivity due to lack of exposure. Over time this creates a concern that something in our world may become so taboo that it can't be discussed or reviewed. This increased sensitivity leads either to censorship or reintroduction to counteract sensitivity. With this in mind, free access to images and information is the only real way to prepare people for the images or ideas they may become exposed to.
1.10.2.4.3. Con: The matter at hand is an emotional issue. Traitors to the country fighting to uphold abhorrent ideals are universally hated beyond those who agree with their hate. The statues represent those abhorrent ideals regardless of the nuances of their supporters today.
1.10.2.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.10.2.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.4.2.
1.10.2.4.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.10.2.4.3.4. Con: [Canada recently created a monument to remember the history of the US Civil War.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41310587)
1.10.2.4.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.
1.10.2.4.3.6. Con: -> See 1.3.11.4.3.4.
1.10.2.4.3.7. Con: It is ironic that the views of a vocal minority of those who oppose Confederate monuments are given priority over both the original intentions of those who built most monuments, as well as a majority of those who now live in the areas where the monuments exist including a plurality of Black Americans.
1.10.2.4.3.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.4.
1.10.2.4.3.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.1.
1.10.2.4.3.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.8.
1.10.2.5. Pro: While the argument against alienating minorities may be too broad, these monuments also alienate whites  by perpetuating the nostalgia that white Americans are deserving of all opportunities, whereas other groups are not. This underlying belief needs to be challenged: the removing of such monuments would do so.
1.10.2.6. Pro: Public spaces are intended for all people. Marginalized groups see Confederate memorials as hate symbols. Therefore, Confederate memorials have no place in our public spaces.
1.10.2.7. Pro: Removing them, stops promoting slavery and racism to younger people in the community of Richmond who don’t know the whole story of slavery.
1.10.2.8. Pro: Many African Americans, whose ancestors were enslaved in early America, are often offended by the statues' remaining.
1.10.2.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.4.
1.10.3. Con: Divisiveness is not a standard of censure in the United States.
1.10.3.1. Con: Government declining to support Confederate relics on public land or with public money is silence, not censure. Is divisiveness an insufficient basis for government to choose which messages to endorse as its own?
1.10.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.
1.10.3.2. Con: Divisiveness is not the cornerstone for a healthy society.
1.10.4. Pro: Confederate memorials, monuments, and flags enable public worshipping of the white supremacy ideology: this creates a strengthening and uniting effect for its supporters.
1.10.4.1. Con: Removing monuments provides white supremacists with the opportunity to present themselves as a marginalized group.
1.10.4.1.1. Con: The alt-right is a voluntary organization. People can join and quit at will. Their claims of being a marginalized group are therefore very weak compared to similar claims made by groups defined by innate traits of birth.
In other words the marginalization would be because of the weakness of their premise and argument, not an arbitrary physical trait. It would therefore be valid and hard to argue as being oppression.
1.10.4.1.1.1. Pro: The "alt-right" is not a monolithic group.
1.10.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: [There are many different groups in the alt-right](https://www.quora.com/What-subcultures-and-groups-comprise-the-Alt-Right/answer/Jon-Davis-10). \(also [www.npr.org](http://www.npr.org/2017/08/15/543730227/unite-the-right-charlottesville-rally-represented-collection-of-alt-right-groups\))\)
1.10.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.10.4.1.1.2. Con: Propaganda does not need to be true to be effective — some people will believe propaganda that plays into their own biases without verifying whether it is has any factual basis.
1.10.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: This false propaganda, commonly called "alternative facts" is widely used by the alt-right.
1.10.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con: "Fake news" is commonly used by both the left and right. Bias exists regardless of political spectrum.
1.10.4.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: [The left has a fake news problem as well.](http://www.businessinsider.com/fake-news-left-liberal-problem-2016-12)
1.10.4.1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: [Fake news happens on both the left and right.](http://www.postbulletin.com/opinion/columnists/fake-news-comes-from-left-and-right/article_01bce5e3-0677-5318-981e-361587be0d7e.html)
1.10.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: Like many issues, the revision of history or even current events \(sometimes called "alternative history" and "alternative news"\) is used to fit things to a particular false world view.
1.10.4.1.2. Con: To the contrary, removing them might also send the message that this ideology is not acceptable in the US and thus discourage those who might be attracted by it.
1.10.4.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.12.9.
1.10.4.1.3. Pro: By claiming that they are being marginalized, white supremacists can assert that they are an underdog group facing oppression. This is an effective tactic to increase a cause's support base.
1.10.4.1.3.1. Con: The marginalization they would face would be a fair marginalization because the ideas are being marginalized and they chose to go with them rather than change their opinion. If they cannot support their ideas it is not valid to then claim oppression when those ideas are discarded.
1.10.4.1.3.2. Con: The support base is due to the proliferation of their ideas and a lack of resolve to confront them. The attention to these statues also galvanizes their opposition.
1.10.4.1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.2.1.
1.10.4.1.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.10.4.2. Con: This implies that most if not all of those in favor of keeping the statues are white supremacists, which is a baseless claim.
1.10.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.1.
1.10.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.4.
1.10.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.
1.10.4.2.4. Con: It is perfectly consistent with these monuments being used as rallying places for white supremacists, even if most of their supporters are not white supremacists.  It is only necessary that some of the supporters be white supremacists.  This is uncontroversially the case, as white supremacists themselves [attest](http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article167519647.html).
1.10.4.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.2.
1.10.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.
1.10.4.4. Pro: Confederate monuments and flags act as rallying points for far right extremists.
1.10.4.4.1. Con: No white supremacists were openly gathering at confederate monuments until those monuments were threatened with removal. It is not the monuments per se, but the call for their removal, that has galvanized white supremacists.
1.10.4.5. Con: The term "public worshiping of white supremacist ideology" demands more complete definition. A statue of Robert E. Lee, generally speaking, does not inspire public worship of any sort, much less of a "white supremacist ideology" \(since Lee was anything but an ideologue\).
1.10.5. Con: -> See 1.7.7.
1.10.6. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.
1.10.7. Con: That is to say if something is too "painful" or controversial, it should be removed, i.e. forgotten.
1.10.8. Pro: The unequal quantity of these monuments in more proliferance than monuments honoring contributions from black union soldiers or buffalo soldiers in our nations history is not representative of the beliefs of the majority of members of our society, yet the majority of members of our society are presented with their propaganda and underrepresented members are hurt by seeing them every time they renew their auto registration in public buildings with such monuments on the lawn.
1.10.9. Pro: The people who are so eager to keep the statues up are often the same people who oppose the creation of monuments to civil rights leaders. If the monuments are not put in a proper historical context their divisiveness could outweigh their usefulness as reminders of two very difficult periods of American history.
1.10.10. Con: -> See 1.1.18.3.2.
1.10.11. Pro: The confederate flag represents a time in history where people of color were not fairly represented in society and hanging the confederate flag on memorials seems almost as an acceptance of those viewpoints.
1.10.12. Pro: The past cannot be changed, but one can avoid glorifying it in the interest of the good of society by not flying the flag.
1.10.13. Con: Removing these statues will further strengthen extremists and thus cause more divisions than keeping them would.
1.10.13.1. Con: Just as keeping them would further strengthen the far left. Whether the monuments are removed or not, society will be divided; thus divisiveness is not a good justification upon which to base the decision for removal.
1.10.13.2. Con: The discussion is to decide if these statues should be removed, not to predict how some might react if they are removed. There will always be dissent, or else there would be no debate.
1.10.13.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.1.
1.10.13.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.
1.10.13.5. Pro: Removing these statues and flags helps hate groups recruit new members. Not everyone considers them symbols of slavery, but as expression of a political ideal, and might feel threatened and radicalise if these symbols are removed.
1.10.13.5.1. Con: Silence in the face of hate groups helps them recruit as well. Declining to acquiesce to their requests in our democratic processes is how we make it clear that they are not welcome.
1.10.13.5.1.1. Con: A fire cannot burn without oxygen. As documented by the ADL here \([www.adl.org](https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-report-kkk-declining-in-stature-and-significance)\), the KKK had been in decline for quite some time. Insofar as the KKK appears to be resurgent in the last few months, it may well be due to the public effort to remove Confederate memorials which has given avowed racists a public grievance, a public platform, and a vast new opportunity to recruit. It would have been better to let racism die in darkness.
1.10.13.5.2. Con: Discussing secession is not the same things as declaring war and actually seceding. US citizens always have the first amendment right to dissent. US citizens do not have the right to declare war on the government.
1.10.13.5.2.1. Con: "But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security." –The Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776
1.10.13.6. Pro: Any removal of historical monuments would, at this point, legitimize the actions of politically motivated vandals who have [taken it upon themselves](https://www.vox.com/2017/8/15/16150176/watch-protesters-topple-confederate-soldier-statue-durham-nc) to destroy some of these statues.
1.10.13.6.1. Con: Basing a rational decision on whether to remove monuments or not should not be based on the criminal actions of others.  Those that have defaced public property should be penalized appropriately and as a separate item.
1.10.13.6.2. Con: Allowing the statues to stand legitimizes the actions of the Nazi/White Supremacists whose stated goal was to keep these statues up. Either response legitimizes extremists.
1.10.13.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.2.
1.10.13.6.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.1.4.
1.10.13.6.3. Con: Conjecture and circular.  Vandalization is not the purpose. Removing statues legally doesn't have a psychological or social impact on vandalism
1.10.13.6.3.1. Con: If people are being told that monuments have no legal purpose, destroying them illegally becomes moral.
1.10.13.7. Pro: -> See 1.10.4.1.
1.10.13.8. Con: The strength of racists and others is present regardless. If removing these statues helps expose them, then all the better to defeat them and their ideology.
1.10.13.9. Con: -> See 1.10.4.1.2.
1.10.14. Con: -> See 1.3.11.4.
1.11. Con: Confederate monuments, flags and memorials honor an important part of the American story.
1.11.1. Con: These public monuments do not honor the story of the [32%](http://faculty.weber.edu/kmackay/statistics_on_slavery.htm) of the population of the Confederacy who was enslaved. In fact, the continued veneration of  Confederate figures dishonors them and their descendants.
1.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.11.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.4.
1.11.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.
1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.13.1.
1.11.3. Pro: Confederate monuments play an important role in teaching our history.
1.11.3.1. Pro: It is important to leave Confederate memorials and monuments up to teach our own painful history.
1.11.3.1.1. Pro: Removing these artifacts is equivalent to erasing history, which makes learning from past successes and mistakes more difficult.
1.11.3.1.1.1. Con: Many of the monuments that have been removed thus far have been [relocated](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/16/us/where-confederate-statues-end-up/index.html) to more culturally appropriate places such as museums or cemeteries, therefore it is inaccurate to say that history is being erased.
1.11.3.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.
1.11.3.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.3.
1.11.3.1.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.
1.11.3.1.1.2. Con: Removing the memorials does not equate to erasing history; better to ensure that all people are encouraged to participate in public life.
1.11.3.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.
1.11.3.1.1.2.2. Con: Removing memorials because some are offended devolves to "who does and does not have a right to be offended?"
1.11.3.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Removing Confederate memorials will  not whitewash history. We have entire cities in the United States devoted to the Civil War \(e.g. Gettysburg, Manassas, etc.\)  We can't avoid the Civil War anymore than Europe can deny WWI or WWII.  Rather, by keeping the memorials in place, we prioritize the past over plurality in present— at time we need diversity most.
1.11.3.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.3.2.4.
1.11.3.1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Diversity includes representing those who served in the Confederacy.
1.11.3.1.1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.
1.11.3.1.1.2.2.1.2.2. Con: Diversity does not demand that we overrepresent those who served in the Confederacy. There is some quantity of Confederate monuments which are enough; the rest can be removed without harm to diversity.
1.11.3.1.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.11.3.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: My being offended by a monument is not a legitimate reason to demand its removal.  Those for whom the monument has value or meaning are just as entitled to their views of it as I am, and my negative responses to it should not have the power to deny their positive responses to it.  I need to accept that I can control whether I am offended by a monument, and not try to impose my beliefs on others who do not share them.
1.11.3.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.11.5.1.1.
1.11.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.9.2.
1.11.3.1.3. Con: If we are to teach our own painful history through memorials, we should memorialize the oppressed rather than the oppressors.
1.11.3.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.4.1.
1.11.3.1.5. Con: There are numerous threads to our history. Highlighting Confederate symbols in places where they are abundant, even supposing it is constructive, comes at the expense of teaching other history.
1.11.3.1.6. Pro: We must inform our children of who the men and women cast in bronze are.  Statue or not, it is the elders who pass history onto young people. Nobody is born with prejudice.
1.11.3.1.7. Con: -> See 1.2.13.9.2.1.
1.11.3.1.8. Con: Confederate memorials are generally designed to make their subjects look good and heroic. They make senseless murder look attractive. They do not make the history look painful.
1.11.3.1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.6.1.2.
1.11.3.1.8.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.3.
1.11.3.1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.4.
1.11.3.1.9. Con: Public spaces are decorated as much for art as anything. Teaching history is only a fraction of the impact of a space.
1.11.3.1.9.1. Pro: All monuments are works of art before they are statements of politics and art is meant to make us think, not make us forget.
1.11.3.1.9.1.1. Con: Not all artworks are equivalent in artistic value.
1.11.3.1.9.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.9.1.1.1.1.1.
1.11.3.1.9.1.2. Con: Digital recordings, encyclopedia articles, websites and so on already include ample data on the confederacy, it is not clear what useful information is added.
1.11.3.1.9.1.3. Pro: Removing Confederate monuments limits personal freedom of expression by limiting the artists who aspire to represent the Civil War Era.
1.11.3.1.9.1.4. Pro: For some people these monuments will bring hurtful and painful emotions, yet if removed, future generations won't have the opportunity to know about their history. Historical atrocities must be remembered as so are victories.
1.11.3.1.9.1.4.1. Con: The Civil War was about many things, but genocide isn't one of them.
1.11.3.1.9.1.4.2. Pro: It is far more compelling to use an icon, good or evil, to generate conversation and establish educated perspectives than simply remove an inconvenient obstacle. While there must always be mindful consideration--not all situations are equal--the idea that demolishing the statue somehow achieves a great moral victory is frivolous. The victory is when a curious child is told the true history of a nation rife with turmoil and controversy because she happened upon a strange stone man in the park.
1.11.3.1.9.1.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.11.3.1.9.1.4.2.2. Con: Remembering history does not require maintaining statues in public places. A full appreciation of history may demand their removal.
1.11.3.1.9.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.4.1.
1.11.3.1.9.1.4.2.2.2. Con: Many evaluate removal of the Confederate statues from their own perspective while ignoring the perspectives of the locals who actually erected them. To many in the South, the war was more about states rights than slavery. Although, slavery was the wedge issue over which the disagreement occurred with the North, the driving force to many in the South was local determination of laws and local governance. Forcibly removing the statues further exacerbates wounds from Reconstruction Era.
1.11.3.1.9.1.4.2.2.2.1. Con: The question of what symbols mean is a moral question. The moral reason states wanted to exercise their perceived right of secession is made absolutely clear in ["The Declaration of Causes of Seceding States"](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states), which mentions preserving slavery 84 times.

1.11.3.1.9.1.4.2.2.2.2. Pro: Many actions during the Reconstruction Era disenfranchised whites and violated Constitutional protections, including the right to representation in government and the right to private property \(land, not slaves\) for instance.

1.11.3.1.9.1.4.2.2.6. Pro: Politicians, such as New Orleans mayor [Mitch Landrieu](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/full-speech-mitch-landrieu-addresses-removal-of-confederate-statues/2017/05/31/cbc3b3a2-4618-11e7-8de1-cec59a9bf4b1_video.html?utm_term=.dd751c8af397), have noted that Confederate monuments are often erected due to an improper nostalgia for the period. Thus they reflect a failure to learn history.
1.11.3.1.9.1.4.3. Con: A monument to those complicit in a genocide is a poor way to honor its victims and remember its costs.
1.11.3.1.10. Con: Statues aren't a way to remember history, they're a collective decision about who to honor and what our values are as a society. The disproportionate reverence placed on Confederate figures demonstrates a fondness for, if not an explicit endorsement of, white supremacy.

If preservation of the past is your concern, more robust and thorough historical education serves better than statues that glorify slaveholders.

1.11.3.1.12. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.5.1.
1.11.3.1.13. Pro: Leaving statues in a public space creates a situation in which citizens are more likely to discuss why the ideas they represented were supplanted by opposing ideas than if those statues were less publicly displayed. This reduces the likelihood that those citizens will endorse ideas that may have evolved from similar ideas represented by the statues.
1.11.3.1.14. Con: -> See 1.2.11.5.
1.11.3.1.15. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.2.
1.11.3.1.16. Pro: Modern American methods of war have developed to the point where casualties fall disproportionately on our enemies. It is important that we have physical reminders in our communities of a time when going to war meant that towns might lose a great number of their sons and daughters. Monuments to Confederate soldiers serve this purpose. They warn against the myth of easy victory.
1.11.3.1.17. Pro: By destroying the iconography memorializing history, we forget history. Those ideologies, if even they were wrong, are doomed to repeat.
1.11.3.1.17.1. Pro: "Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it." –[George Santayana](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Santayana#Vol._I.2C_Reason_in_Common_Sense)
1.11.3.1.17.2. Pro: [History shows patterns of avoidable tragedies where similar recorded events happened before.](http://history.howstuffworks.com/historical-events/10-worst-ways-history-has-repeated-itself.htm)
1.11.3.1.17.2.1. Con: This does not prove that statues would have made any difference.
1.11.3.1.17.3. Con: If History's lessons are in part to not repeat the mistakes, then the divisive nature of our political discussions \(about this topic or in general\) are a sign that the statues' value in reminding us of such a course seems ineffective, rendering the "reminders of our past" argument somewhat mute.
1.11.3.1.17.4. Pro: Racism and hatred are present problems, and ignoring their historical causes and consequences will only worsen the issue.
1.11.3.1.17.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.5.
1.11.3.1.17.4.2. Pro: Memorials, flags, and monuments were placed and maintained by the people that occupy an area. Removing these will not change how they think, just make it harder to recognize to visitors.
1.11.3.1.17.5. Pro: A third or half statues can be moved to museums or historical societies. However, some should be up.  Not only because history cannot, and shouldn't be, erased; but because total removal could cause apathy or national amnesia. Americans need to know what was done to Native Americans and African Americans.  Citizens do not need to be soothed or coddled, but need to be "slapped" back to reality, and to remain awake and vigilant.
1.11.3.1.17.5.1. Pro: Germans do know what they did in the 1930s and 1940s.
1.11.3.1.17.5.1.1. Con: There are no statues of Nazis in Germany, and they seem to have a healthy vigilance nonetheless.
1.11.3.1.17.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.2.1.1.

1.11.3.1.17.7. Pro: History is not just the history of feel-good, G-Rated, and advertiser-friendly happenings. If you are unwilling to confront the truths, you will not benefit from them.

1.11.3.1.17.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.13.2.
1.11.3.1.17.9. Con: Monuments created to honor those who many do not believe worthy of honor are not themselves impartial memories of history.

1.11.3.1.17.10. Con: The purpose of these statues was not simply to represent an ideology but also to act as a reminder to Black people that they are inferior and to support the Lost Cause narrative.
1.11.3.1.17.11. Con: -> See 1.2.11.5.1.2.
1.11.3.1.17.12. Con: Statues and flags themselves are only symbols; one cannot derive history directly from viewing them.  You would have to hear or read a historical account to actually understand the history of an object.

1.11.3.1.17.15. Con: Monuments are not needed for remembering history, only glorifying it.
1.11.3.1.17.15.1. Con: It could just as easily be said of history books or biographies that they are not needed for remembering history, only glorifying it.
1.11.3.1.17.15.1.1. Con: History books and biographies usually give a detailed overview and do not imply that the actions are condoned. By including simply a monument \(or even a positive description\), we merely glorify.
1.11.3.1.17.15.2. Con: [Hiroshima Peace Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial) is an obvious example of a monument that does not seek to glorify.
1.11.3.1.17.15.2.1. Con: Hiroshima Peace Memorial serves as a reminder of the atrocity committed, even if is not glorifying what happened, is still a partial reminder of what we should avoid, as, another example, the [Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe). Any monument in a public area is subdued to morality and it's never a blank statement of what happened.
1.11.3.1.17.16. Con: This statement presupposes that we will repeat things because we don't remember them. This is a Faulty [Generalization logical fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faulty_generalization.).

1.11.3.1.17.18. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.2.1.3.
1.11.3.1.18. Pro: Confederate memorials remind us of a time when Americans senselessly murdered one another. Because we could no longer argue with words, we argued with rifles and cannons to the tune of ~1,000,000 souls. Anything that contributes to helping us remember this costly lesson is worthy of preservation.

1.11.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.1.1.1.1.
1.11.3.4. Pro: We all have pasts, individually & collectively, that are mixed. Each chapter explains our identity and the journey traveled to arrive at where we are today. Those who seek to deny the past denigrate the struggles and achievements of those who came before. Even more troubling, tearing down monuments is akin to burning books and it is a short step to murdering people. Respect for yesterday is the only guarantee of freedom tomorrow.
1.11.3.4.1. Con: Removal of Confederate symbols from public land is not synonymous with denying the past or with having those symbols destroyed. It is a different emphasis on what we wish to champion as the best of America, and nothing more.
1.11.3.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.
1.11.3.4.2. Con: It is very easy to take down a statue without killing anyone at the same time. Most commonly, statues are removed at the cost of zero persons being killed.
1.11.3.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.5.7.2.4.1.
1.11.3.6. Con: A more appropriate monument that honors the victims of slavery could easily teach the same hard truths and lessons.
1.11.3.7. Con: There is an important distinction between that which we consider heritage, and that which we consider history. Heritage is the collection of inalienable cultural customs that define us as a people, and as individuals. We hold heritage with high esteem in sacred observance, because it represents the fundamental values and practices that makes us proud to be who we are. History is the dispassionate transcript of the past. Removing the monuments is a rejection of racism as heritage, not as history.
1.11.3.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2.6.1.1.
1.11.3.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.5.1.1.3.
1.11.3.8. Con: Honoring history means telling the complete story. However, the story is not complete without  reference to the significant events that occurred afterwards - abolition of slavery, civil rights movement, emergence of African-Americans in leadership position/excellence in many spheres of life.
1.11.3.9. Con: -> See 1.11.3.1.9.1.4.2.2.
1.11.3.10. Con: The Civil War is a part of US history not to be honored, but remembered. If we leave the statues up, we glorify the Civil War as a thing to be proud of, and it is not. It is to be learned from history books, not celebrated in monuments.
1.11.3.10.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.
1.11.3.11. Con: Those statues honor particular figures, not the historic period as a whole. So removing monuments that glorify confederate generals does not affect the teaching of history.

1.11.3.11.5. Con: All memorials and monuments are historical works of art that add character and should never be removed. It's important for our children and newcomers to be able to study and view those works of art and learn about our history.
1.11.3.11.5.1. Con: Some works of art serve as memorials honoring the victims of past atrocities. Some works of art celebrate the powers that committed those atrocities. When art is displayed in public that celebrates something or someone, it represents state endorsement of what it represents. Some art is better suited for museums, where it can be studied and viewed, remembering history without celebrating it.

1.11.3.11.5.2. Con: If a work of art represents oppression \(or celebrates an oppressor\), then displaying it publicly means those targeted can only avoid it by avoiding the space, thus making the space discriminatory. Such a work of art does not need to be publicly displayed in order to be remembered. Those who choose to seek it may seek it in a museum.

1.11.3.11.5.3. Con: The character of the monuments determine the values of the venue that hosts them. A monument in a city hall reflects the values of the city hall. A historical monument which does not reflect the values of the city hall would therefore be appropriate in a museum, or cultural center reflective of the values of the monument in question.

1.11.3.11.5.4. Con: Monuments that reflect the negative position of a political or military movement, should not be put in a prominent position in the very venues that are hosted by the government or society for which those movements fought against. Hitler's SS should not have a monument in front of the German Bund. Saddam Hussein statues should not be prominently in the center of Baghdad and its environs.

1.11.4. Pro: Removing Confederate monuments is an insult both to those they remember and those who erected the monuments in the first place.
1.11.4.1. Pro: Monuments convey respect. Their presence helps educate us about the presence of phenomena that made it possible to respect people whose legacy seems immoral.
1.11.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.2.4.1.
1.11.4.1.2. Con: We should not respect or revere immorality or treason.

1.11.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.6.2.1.
1.11.4.4.2. Con: Honouring your enemy isn't a viable practice.
1.11.4.4.2.1. Pro: They fought and died for the Confederacy, which by definition means they were enemies of the United States.
1.11.4.4.2.2. Con: In the case of the Civil War, there was a goal of reconciliation after it was over. In many cases that included honoring the deaths of our enemies as a sad but necessary loss.

1.11.4.4.6.3. Con: When we honor Civil War Soldiers in uniform, we are honoring them as individuals who fired on members of the United States Military which is totally unacceptable. Statues in Confederate Uniform should be removed immediately.
1.11.4.4.6.3.1. Pro: Statues of members of the Confederate Army who are not in uniform and who added value to their communities in ways that did not include firing on the USA are a separate issue that should be decided locally on a statue by statue basis.
1.11.4.4.6.4. Con: Though the Confederacy spent time, money, and the lives of soldiers to fight the war they were fighting, it was for the wrong cause and that can never be forgiven.
1.11.4.4.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.19.5.2.2.
1.11.4.4.7. Pro: It should be remembered that many of our current members of our military are from the southern states and can trace their family History to the very soldiers who fought in the Civil war as well as those who've fought in others wars. Confederate memorials, flags, and monuments should never be removed.
1.11.4.4.7.1. Con: It should also be remembered that many of our current members of our military and general population can trace their family history to people that were oppressed or granted limited and unequal rights as a precursor and major cause of the same war. Public objects that dignify this cause should be removed \(not destroyed\).

1.11.4.8. Con: As a state built on the cause of white supremacy and the enslavement of Blacks, the Confederacy and individuals who defended it should not be honored.
1.11.4.8.1. Con: The union kept slavery legal throughout the entire civil war. The [emancipation](http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm) proclamation, for example, only declared confederate slaves free, but not the union slaves.
1.11.4.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.11.4.3.4.1.2.
1.11.4.8.1.2. Con: Its important to remember that Lincoln did not campaign on a platform of abolishing slavery, but that also does not mean that many who voted against him did not believe he would and that fear is what drove their actions.
1.11.4.8.1.3. Con: Regardless of the historical context at the time, these monuments are now inextricably linked to slavery.

1.11.4.8.5. Con: The Confederacy never existed as a nation in the first place. Not really. Attempted, but failed.  It is the US in general that was built on slavery in the southern states of the union.
1.11.4.8.5.1. Con: The Confederate States of America had a flag, a constitution, a legislature, and a president.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America)
1.11.4.8.6. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.
1.11.4.8.7. Con: Many of those traitors to England also owned slaves of their own. Both Washington and Jefferson owned slaves -- and yet are featured on the face of US currency. No one in history is perfect.
1.11.4.8.7.1. Con: Washington is primarily known for commanding the army that won the American Revolution, and being our first President. Jefferson is primarily known for penning the Declaration of Independence and creating The Democratic Party. Confederates are primarily known for [going to war to defend their right to secede so they could keep owning slaves](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/reasons-secession). Most have made mistakes, but some are notorious for them.

1.11.4.8.8. Pro: Any monument, flag, statue, or other object representing a hateful ideology, should be removed or else modified to decry the ideology for which it once stood.
1.11.4.8.8.1. Con: The Confederate ideology wasn't a hateful ideology at the time. The concept of secession had nothing to do with "hate" and everything to do with a fight for independence.

1.11.4.8.8.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.
1.11.4.8.8.1.5. Con: The confederacy fought for an independence that hinged upon the belief that black people could be considered property.
1.11.4.8.8.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.11.4.8.8.1.6. Con: The confederacy did not allow independent political action to its sizable minority of abolitionists and black people.
1.11.4.8.8.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.9.3.1.
1.11.4.8.8.1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.2.13.3.1.
1.11.4.8.8.1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.9.3.
1.11.4.8.9. Pro: History? There are no monuments to Hitler, Tojo or Bin Laden. There shouldn't be Confederate monuments, either. On the contrary, Confederate monuments perpetuate the lie that the Civil War was not about slavery and was instead some kind of noble cause.
1.11.4.8.9.1. Con: -> See 1.11.4.8.1.
1.11.4.8.9.2. Con: Hitler, Tojo, or Bin Laden would not have monuments built for them in the United States, because they were not citizens or residents of the United States. Confederate leaders were, both before and after the conflict.
1.11.4.8.9.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.5.1.
1.11.4.8.9.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.11.4.8.9.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.3.8.3.1.
1.11.4.8.9.6. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.5.
1.11.4.8.9.7. Con: The Civil war is nicely analogous to the revolutionary war. In both cases the "rebels" were more friendly towards slavery than the "mother country." One of the main differences is that the South lost to the US, whereas the US beat England. These leaders have virtually nothing in common with Hitler et. al.. Imagine that we lost the revolutionary war with England, and then how we would feel about statues of George Washington..
1.11.4.8.9.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.
1.11.4.8.9.9. Con: All of those statues were either removed within the lifetime of the people who put them up, or were never put up in the first place. They were not historic monuments at the time so there was no real loss in taking them down.
1.11.4.8.9.9.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.9.1.1.1.1.
1.11.4.8.9.10. Con: The Confederacy is not comparable to Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, or Al Qaeda.
1.11.4.8.9.10.1. Con: It is comparable in that the US fought wars against those enemies.
1.11.4.8.9.10.2. Con: Al Qaeda, Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and the Confederacy fought for the destruction of the United States.
1.11.4.8.9.10.2.1. Con: It can be argued that while the first three actively fought for the destruction of the US, the Confederacy was simply fighting to separate from it. As such, these are not analogous forces.
1.11.4.8.9.10.3. Con: The Confederacy killed far more Americans than Al Qaeda.
1.11.4.8.10. Pro: In 1860 there were four million slaves worth close to $3 billion. In the 11 states that eventually formed the Confederacy, four out of ten people were slaves in 1860, and these people accounted for more than half the agricultural labor in those states.[eh.net](https://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-economics-of-the-civil-war/)
1.11.4.8.10.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.8.1.3.
1.11.4.8.11. Con: The South saw their way of life being threatened by removal of slavery. Even though slavery is wrong, people at that time viewed it as an inherited [necessity](https://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/4884) to prosper. The South could not see the Union forcefully changing their lifestyle.
1.11.4.8.11.1. Con: Since only a [minority](http://www.civilwarcauses.org/stat.htm) of southern citizens owned slaves, it is arguable that their way of life was not going to [change](http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/5-myths-about-slavery) that much with abolition.

1.11.4.9. Con: -> See 1.6.9.
1.11.4.10. Con: This is precisely why the monuments should be taken down; they honor that part of US history. That part of US history is important, and will be remembered, but it should NOT be honored.
1.11.5. Pro: Confederate monuments are part of American culture.
1.11.5.1. Pro: All memorials add character to a city and the country. The past is rarely pleasant, and no human being is a sign of pure virtuosity. To tear down monuments and memorials is to erase history from the public view.
1.11.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.11.5.
1.11.5.1.2. Con: These memorials can be easily replaced with modern memorials to events or individuals we prefer to celebrate. For example writers or scientists, instead of killers.
1.11.5.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.7.
1.11.5.1.3. Con: No human may be a sign of pure virtuosity, but few have as much blood on their hands and represent attitudes that are not acceptable anymore as do those honored by Confederate memorials and monuments.
1.11.5.1.4. Pro: [Virginia](https://www.theringer.com/2017/8/17/16160286/charlottesville-richmond-montgomery-confederate-monuments) is known for the Civil War, so the [monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_Monument_\(Portsmouth,_Virginia\)) adds character to the city and is a great field trip and tourist attraction.
1.11.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.1.4.6.3.2.3.2.
1.11.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.19.5.2.
1.11.5.4. Con: Culture is fluid and the aspects of our culture that we care to officially celebrate can and will change.
1.11.5.5. Con: It enshrines and frames positively a part of the culture that should be an embarrassment to the ideals of a free and just society. This does not mean we should forget that history, but it should remain in historical context and not glorified.
1.11.6. Con: -> See 1.11.4.10.
1.11.7. Con: The terrorists attacks of [September 11th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) were also an important part of the American story; but if someone wanted to build a statue of Osama Bin Landen in New York, people wouldn't recognize that as honoring that story. The principle is the same.
1.11.8. Con: -> See 1.2.10.1.2.
1.11.9. Con: While many historic landmarks were originally put up with the intention of honoring a particular figure, once that generation has passed those who remain do not preserve history as a means of honoring the people or events but simply because preserving history is valuable in its own right.

As such it is not accurate to say that all historic landmarks such as memorials "honor an important part of American story" but rather simply serve as a memory of our history.
