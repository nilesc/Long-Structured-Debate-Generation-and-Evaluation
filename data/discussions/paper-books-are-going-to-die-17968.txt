Discussion Title: Paper books are going to die

1. Paper books are going to die
1.1. Con: Reading in a paper book feels much better. Some people still prefer paper books over other forms
1.1.1. Pro: A physical book offers tactile and olfactory sensation that e-readers are lacking.
1.1.2. Pro: Many children's books are still popular in physical copies. This means that when these children become adults they will still feel nostalgic about physical books, and perhaps be emotionally attached. Until the primary form of children's literature is electronic we will be waiting for a one generation delay.
1.2. Con: Paper books are here to stay. It won’t disappear, at least anytime soon
1.2.1. Con: There is no timeline suggested in the original post, only that they will die. Like stone tablets and papyrus scrolls, eventually they will die.
1.2.2. Pro: Both paper books and digital forms would co-exist at the same time
1.3. Con: Paper books are seen as more valuable by some readers
1.3.1. Con: This doesn't mean that they will be sold forever.
1.3.2. Pro: The black and white television was once more valuable and more used than the media it replaced. So was the rear projection television. And microfiche. All are very hard to find for sale and nearly dead. People now use different devices to access that same media.
1.3.3. Pro: Paper books hold artistic value
1.3.3.1. Pro: Books that are first editions or that are signed by the author are even more unique.
1.4. Pro: Millennials read more than older readers, and they are tending away from paper books. [bookworks.com](https://www.bookworks.com/2017/11/millennials-reading-habits-book-plans/) These habits drive a trend away from paper books which will result in the eventual death of paper books.
1.4.1. Con: [This article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2017/01/16/millennials-a-generation-of-page-turners/#23a8b25d1978) suggests that millennials largely prefer to buy printed book if it costs the same as digital books.
1.4.2. Con: The trend of digital book sales has been [staginating and declines since 2014](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2017/01/16/millennials-a-generation-of-page-turners/)
1.4.2.1. Con: Digital books are only one competitor to paper books.
1.4.2.2. Con: Here is an example of a digital product that wouldn't show up on the numbers that are quoted in the article about stagnating digital book sales. This author was making $60,000 per month through Patreon with a web serial. Check out his work here: [Parahumans.](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) No ISDN to track his sales in the traditional way. Clearly a digital alternative to ebooks and paper.
1.4.3. Con: The fact that millennials read more means that there is a potential market for both traditional format books as well as digital ones. This simply means that even though they may tend to favour digital formats the act of reading is what creates the demand and therefore the opportunity to sell printed books to them
1.4.3.1. Con: If the original post had a timeline, then your comment would be an excellent con. However, without a timeline in the OP the millennials are just a generation with a trend to read more of all types. The generations before millennials did not have e-books in their youth. The generations after millennials, if the trends continue, eventually won't have paper books.
1.5. Pro: Ebooks are environment friendly. No need to produce paper or recycle it.
1.5.1. Con: Paper is a renewable resource and is biodegradable, while ebook readers are not produced from renewable resources and are vulnerable to planned obsolescence.
1.6. Con: Paper books are not dependent on electricity.
1.6.1. Pro: On long travels electricity to charge a eBook reader might not be as handy to find.
1.6.2. Pro: Since electricity isn't readily available in many rural areas and developing countries, paper books are a more realistic option for much of the world.
1.6.3. Con: I once took a back packing trip off the grid for a full week. A small solar panel on my backpack kept my digital device charged, and I could read after dark without a flashlight.
1.7. Con: Print book sales have been increasing for the past few years [\(+10,3% since 2013\)](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/75735-sales-of-print-books-increased-slightly-in-2017.html)
1.7.1. Con: According to that article, sales only rose 1.9% in 2017. Using the last 5 years of an industry in turmoil misses some key details.
1.7.2. Con: Population growth averages about 1%.
1.8. Con: Certain medical issues preclude people from being able to read e-books.
1.8.1. Pro: The blue light emitted from e-readers and other tech devices is harmful to the eyes; so people with light sensitivity or other neurological ailments often cannot use them.
1.8.1.1. Con: There are blue light filters available for download which can significantly ease this problem.
1.8.2. Con: Many people suffer from [book allergies](https://www.qualityhealth.com/allergies-articles/book-allergy-basics), so digital copies are actually the safer alternative.
1.8.3. Pro: Many elderly people and other who have vision difficulties find it much harder to read the text on digital devices.
1.8.3.1. Con: Unlike print books, which may or may not have a large-print version available, e-readers and other devices give users the option to increase print size for just about anything they're reading.
1.8.4. Con: We will probably find a medical solution to these issues and that will help paper books die.
1.8.4.1. Pro: For example, reading glasses solved a problem for paper books.
1.9. Pro: Ebooks will outnumber paper books. They are cheaper and more practical
1.9.1. Con: Ebooks themselves may be cheaper, but for the price of a $200 Kindle, and a $10 ebook, I can go to a second hand store and buy 210 $1 used hardcopy books. 210 used books is way better than one ebook and a Kindle. They feel nicer, they look nicer, and they'll entertain me much longer.
1.9.1.1. Con: For the price of a Kindle, $79.99, plus the monthly service fee of $9.99, I have access to 600,000 books. The math favors the e-books and the kindle for cost and for length of entertainment.
1.9.1.2. Pro: The paperbooks I want to read rest on a shelf in my office, always easy to find and ready to go. They do look nicer. I often forget which e-book I want to ready next because they are spread across several platforms.
1.9.2. Pro: Ebooks save space. Thousands of books can be stored in one device that is even smaller than one paper book
1.10. Con: Most commercial ebooks are distributed under a far more restrictive license than paper books. Paper books can be lent, resold, kept and re-read without any cooperation from the original publisher or distributor.
1.10.1. Con: These prices will come down as authors realise selling 1 000 000 000 books for $.5 is a lot more profitable than selling 10 000 for $15, so it's not an argument against.
1.11. Pro: Audiobooks is a better option
1.11.1. Pro: Audiobooks are already providing more revenue to publishers than paperbacks. [marketwatch.com](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-some-audiobooks-sell-four-times-as-well-as-their-print-versions-2015-12-08) The end result of this trend is the death of paper books.
1.11.2. Con: Not being able to see what you've bookmarked \(easily\) makes audiobooks an inferior product.
1.11.2.1. Con: I can listen to audiobooks while I drive.
1.11.3. Pro: Audiobooks save time and increase productivity. You can listen to a book while working or doing house chores
