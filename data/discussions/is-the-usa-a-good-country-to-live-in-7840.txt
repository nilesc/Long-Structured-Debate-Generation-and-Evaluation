Discussion Title: Is the USA a good country to live in?

1. The USA is a good country to live in.
1.1. Con: Crime is a significant issue in American society.
1.1.1. Pro: High rates of [homelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_homeless_population) can make big cities relatively unpleasant.
1.1.2. Pro: Crime and violence are often glorified parts of popular culture.
1.1.3. Pro: Gun crime is much [higher](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/10/06/555861898/gun-violence-how-the-u-s-compares-to-other-countries) in the US than in other highly developed countries.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Legal guns [aument criminality](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/02/16/news/more-guns-less-crime-not-according-data)
1.1.4. Pro: The United States has the [highest](https://thinkprogress.org/the-united-states-has-the-largest-prison-population-in-the-world-and-its-growing-d4a35bc9652f/) number of prisoners as a percentage of the general population in the developed world. The U.S. also has the highest raw numbers of prisoners of any single nation in the entire world.
1.1.5. Con: Crime in the US is in an [extended period of decline](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/30/5-facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/).
1.2. Pro: Living in the USA has lots of off shoot benefits.
1.2.1. Pro: Living in the US secures one's English skills.
1.2.1.1. Con: Many other countries teach English as a second language, leading to similarly high English skills and the same general benefits gained from bilingualism.
1.2.1.2. Pro: English is the lingua franca; it is thus the language of business, and many online communities use it as a common language in order to communicate.
1.2.1.3. Con: Living in a country that primarily functions in a certain language does not mean that you will become fluent upon moving there. Many people gradually absorb the amount needed to get by, but it is very possible to live life in a foreign country without speaking the language at more than a basic level.
1.2.1.4. Pro: If people take English classes to improve their English while living in an anglophone country, this will accelerate their learning speed because they are totally immersed.
1.2.2. Con: The USA has many offshoot pitfalls.
1.2.2.1. Pro: If the [trends](https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddhixon/2012/02/09/the-u-s-does-not-have-a-debt-problem-it-has-a-health-care-cost-problem/#52b5fcaf6eb7) of the last 20 years continue, health care spending will eat up U.S. GDP.
1.3. Con: The United State's economy is geared towards helping the already rich.
1.3.1. Pro: Taxes are high in the USA for middle class households while the rich routinely get tax breaks.
1.3.1.1. Pro: The U.S. federal government engages in wasteful spending of taxes more so than any other nation.
1.3.1.2. Pro: The United States imposes taxes on its citizens for income earned anywhere in the world.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: This is irrelevant to you if you live in the US.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: It's one less option nonetheless. People might change their mind in the future. Having this option is especially important to entrepreneurs.
1.3.1.2.1.2. Con: You might want to live in the US and still invest money abroad
1.3.1.2.1.3. Con: It reduces foreign investment in the USA and thus has an important economic impact on all Americans.
1.3.2. Pro: Minimum wage is lower in the United States relative to other countries with developed economies.
1.3.2.1. Con: This is irrelivent when overall economy is ignored and by itself is in no way a means to measure wealth.
1.3.2.2. Con: [Many developed economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_by_country) do not even have a minimum wage.
1.3.3. Con: All capitalist economies are geared to helping the already rich.
1.3.3.1. Con: This is not necessarily true. Germany, for example, is a successful capitalist nation with significantly less income inequality and more focused on the common good than the US.
1.3.3.2. Con: This is exactly the opposite of [the evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality) for all countries.
1.3.4. Pro: The United States's [employment rate](https://data.oecd.org/emp/employment-rate.htm) is lower than other developed nations such as Sweden, Germany and the UK. The low employment rate, when combined with the lack of a strong social safety net leaves the US with one of the highest [poverty rates](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/poverty-rate.htm) in the developed world.
1.3.5. Pro: [Kids](https://www.children.org/global-poverty/global-poverty-facts/facts-about-poverty-in-usa) in the U.S. experience higher poverty rates than most developed nations. Only Greece, Mexico, Israel and Turkey have higher child poverty rates than the U.S.
1.3.5.1. Con: That is because the poverty line in the US is about [$24,000](https://www.children.org/global-poverty/global-poverty-facts/facts-about-poverty-in-usa). The international poverty line is [$1.90 a day](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/10/04/world-bank-forecasts-global-poverty-to-fall-below-10-for-first-time-major-hurdles-remain-in-goal-to-end-poverty-by-2030), which is $693.50 a year \(34.60 times less\).
1.4. Con: The United State's political system favors the wealthy individuals and corporations.
1.4.1. Pro: Labor laws favor those at the top.
1.4.1.1. Pro: There is no mandated minimum vacation time in the US and annual leave is very low compared to other developed countries.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The average vacation time in the US is 10 days after 1 year of work and 14 days after 5 years of work; in [comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_annual_leave_by_country), European countries mandate at least 20 days of vacation per year from the first year of employment.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: The USA is a good place to live, partially because there is no minimum mandated vacation time, allowing workers to freely negotiate the terms of their employment with their employers. For many people, the opportunity to work has more value than the opportunity to not work.
1.4.2. Pro: While the United States may be very rich, its wealth is not evenly distributed: the US ranks very [highly](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/19/global-inequality-how-the-u-s-compares/) in income inequality in the developed world, and that inequality is [increasing](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/05/u-s-income-inequality-on-rise-for-decades-is-now-highest-since-1928/).
1.4.2.1. Con: Absolute wealth, or even wealth relative to other societies, is more important than internal relative wealth.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: There is no point in having the poor poorer just to ensure the rich are less rich.
1.4.3. Con: Every country's political system favors an "elite" class in one way or the other; the US is no different. Inequality is a fact of life and existence.
1.5. Con: The United State's government does not provide as much social welfare as the governments of other developed countries.
1.5.1. Pro: The United States has one of the [most expensive and least effective](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/06/16/once-again-u-s-has-most-expensive-least-effective-health-care-system-in-survey/?utm_term=.d9374d3d2bc8) healthcare systems in the developed world.
1.5.2. Con: While there are many opinions about the United State's health care system \(particularly in Washington\), there’s one overwhelming area of consensus — the United States leads the world in medical innovation which is then adopted within other health systems; other countries benefit from the innovation paid for by US providers/consumers driving our prices higher.
1.5.2.1. Con: While the innovation claim rings true, the cost claim does not. Cost in the US is higher only because, unlike in other countries, big pharma and care providers can \(but need not\) charge any price they want, up to a level that amounts to extortion.
1.5.3. Pro: There is an opioid epidemic and drug crisis that the government does not have the ability to deal with adequately compared to countries like [Switzerland](http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1926160,00.html) that provide clean needles and free drugs to help users change.
1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.
1.6. Pro: America offers an abundance of vast open lands, wilderness and beautiful landscapes. This is a reason for outdoor enthusiasts to enjoy living here.
1.6.1. Con: Pollution is rampant across the American Landscape & the Environmental Protection Agency has been weakened to the point of [regulatory capture](https://www.sej.org/headlines/pruitts-epa-verge-regulatory-capture-study-says).
1.7. Con: American culture instills certain values in its citizens, some of which are harmful.
1.7.1. Pro: Patriarchy and misogyny are entrenched in America's institutions and laws.
1.7.1.1. Con: In contrast to other countries, the United States is largely less oppressive and patriarchal.
1.7.2. Pro: American culture promotes the value of gun ownership, leading to the [greatest number of civilian firearms per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country) in the entire world. This results in tens of thousands of deaths from gun violence every year.
1.7.2.1. Con: This is irrelevant, guns don’t commit murder, people do. If those haven’t been committed murder with guns, they would have been with other measures or illegal guns \(most of them still was committed with illegal guns\).
1.7.2.2. Con: There are [invaluable lives](https://www.investors.com/politics/columnists/how-many-lives-are-saved-by-guns-and-why-dont-gun-controllers-care/) saved due to gun holders on a daily basis.
1.7.3. Con: The American culture instills positive values too, such as a work ethic.
1.7.4. Pro: The USA is particularly susceptible to cults of personality.
1.7.5. Pro: Racism is deeply entrenched in American institutions and cultural practices.
1.7.6. Pro: Americans are [materialistic](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/01/consumerism.aspx) and emphasize the importance of large sizes in terms of products or goods like cars. This culture places a drain on resources.
1.7.6.1. Con: This is not exclusive to American culture.
1.8. Pro: The US struggles with an immigration problem and not an emigration problem, showing that it is a popular living destination: more people want to go there than leave. The masses have voted with their feet.
1.8.1. Con: The fact that people are moving in doesn't necessarily mean that the USA is a good country to live in. It just means that it is better than their countries of origin which usually happen to be developing or underdeveloped countries.
1.8.2. Con: Fewer people are attempting to illegally immigrate to the US than at any time in the past [forty years](https://www.businessinsider.com/border-crossings-arrests-trump-historic-low-data-charts-2018-4). Meanwhile, emigration to Canada from the US, for example, is up \(slightly\).
1.8.3. Con: The "immigration problem" is fabricated. Immigration, legal and otherwise, has been a fundamental part of America since its founding.
1.9. Pro: The USA has a good economy.
1.9.1. Pro: A good economy allows the US government to provide good social services.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Its educational system is ranked high above the global average.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: The US does not rank in the [top 10](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/dec/07/world-education-rankings-maths-science-reading) for education. It even ranks 35th among the industrialized countries for math.
1.9.1.2. Pro: The country has a healthcare system high above the global average; the average life expectancy in the USA is over 79 years old.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.
1.9.1.3. Con: -> See 1.5.
1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.4.2.
1.9.3. Pro: The purchasing power of money is high in the USA.
1.9.4. Pro: It ranks among the richest countries in the world, with a gross national income per capita [56,810 dollars](https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/GNI-per-capita-Atlas-and-PPP-table).
1.9.5. Pro: The US has a high GDP per Capita \(PPP\), ranking [11th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita#Lists_of_countries_and_dependencies) out of 187 countries.
1.9.6. Pro: While not everyone succeeds, social mobility in the United States is very high compared to most others. In general, people are judged less by where they came from and more by their ability and character.
1.9.7. Pro: The United States ranks [10th](http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/USA) in the UN Human Development Index.
1.10. Pro: The USA has a well developed and stable political system.
1.10.1. Pro: The USA was founded on the ideals of renaissancentist classical liberals
1.10.1.1. Pro: The USA enjoys a free market economy.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: Having a free market can be a good thing, however the U.S. tends to have too free a market, leading to the exploitation of its workers through low minimum wages and poor benefits.
1.10.1.1.1.1. Con: The household income of even the poorest 10% of the US population is still significantly higher than the total average household income of most countries.
1.10.1.1.2. Con: The free market in the US is perhaps too free: there are very large monopolies that gouge American customers and can, in the [pharmaceutical](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/business/a-huge-overnight-increase-in-a-drugs-price-raises-protests.html) industry, even threaten lives because of dramatic price changes.
1.10.1.1.2.1. Con: The problems of the pharmaceutical industry are more due to corporatism - its control by large interest groups - than the free market.
1.10.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Countries that have more or less completely free markets do not seem to have this problem to this extent.
1.10.1.1.3. Pro: This means it would be a good place to start a business.
1.10.1.1.4. Con: Markets are not so free anymore. Corporations have a lot of control over the government.
1.10.1.1.4.1. Pro: [The US is less restrictive on banning chemicals as the EU](http://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/regulations/international-laws/)
1.10.1.2. Pro: In the USA, freedom of speech and expression is protected.
1.10.1.3. Pro: Through trial and error we have built upon the framework of the constitution, and liberal democratic ideals the foundation of a great nation.  The US isn't there yet, but as a youthful country it has time to grow. This potential growth makes the US an exciting and dynamic place to live.
1.10.2. Pro: There is a deep-rooted respect for the separation of powers of state organs in the USA. This prevents tyrannical government.
1.10.2.1. Con: At least currently, this former respect is met with contempt on a daily basis.
1.10.2.1.1. Pro: The current president looks rather annoyed by the separation of powers, frequently picking fights with the other branches of government, especially the judiciary. His peddling of conspiracy theories, e.g. about a "deep state", undermines public trust in institutions. Calling the free press "the enemy of the people" doesn't help either. All this eats away at the "deep-rooted respect" for democracy and seems to pave the way for a more authoritarian style of government.
1.10.3. Con: The USA is currently in the midst of a constitutional crisis with a Supreme Court majority perhaps taken [unconstitutionally](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/us/politics/obama-supreme-court-merrick-garland.html), a [rurally skewed](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/upshot/as-american-as-apple-pie-the-rural-votes-disproportionate-slice-of-power.html) congress that does not represent the majority, and a President that may be a [hostile foreign agent](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/trump-administration-holds-off-on-new-russia-sanctions-despite-law-idUSKBN1FI2V7).
1.10.4. Con: The political decisions are no longer, and haven't been for about 30 years, based on the majority opinions of the American people, but instead are directly correlated to the views and preferences of those entities and individuals who provide the funding to the political representatives. [A study from Princeton University](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B) shows that the opinions of the average American have no significant impact on the policies enacted by the government. The opinions of the donor class are strongly correlated.
1.11. Pro: The USA has a multicultural society.
1.11.1. Pro: A multicultural setting generally results in tolerance for different cultures, religions and identities.
1.11.1.1. Pro: The US is very accepting of its Jewish population, and as such has provided a relatively safe haven and allowed them to pursue religious practices.
1.11.1.2. Con: Unless there are economic hardships, in which case this accentuates conflict between cultures as people seek to blame easy targets.
1.11.2. Pro: A multicultural environment allows people to experience aspects of other cultures like languages and traditions, that they would otherwise not experience.
1.11.3. Con: Cultural diversity does not necessarily make a country good to live in. It can also lead to social unrest and discrimination.
1.11.4. Con: The United States of America is a melting pot
1.11.5. Pro: Multicultural societies foster dynamism and creative solutions to problems, despite the frictions that may exist. \([Samarkand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand) - esp. during the Timurid period\).
1.11.6. Con: The[power holders](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/26/us/race-of-american-power.html) in the United States are relatively homogenous.
1.12. Pro: The US constitution and legal system protects and allows for the provision of fundamental human rights.
1.12.1. Con: The United States continually [fails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States) to live up to its ideals.
1.12.2. Pro: Individuals in the United States have a lot of power to enforce their rights and property in court.
1.12.3. Con: The US constitution has time and again been used to allow criminals and those with mental illnesses access to arms, a phenomenon that has led to many mass shootings and to crime.
1.12.4. Con: The Constitution has not prevented black people from being denied universal human rights, nor did suffrage for women follow from its hallowed principles.
1.12.5. Con: Rich people and corporations have vastly more power and opportunity to enforce their rights and property in court. Ordinary people are the captives of unfair arbitration agreements, while predators like PayDay Loan outfits and for-profit schools are protected by armies of lawyers, lobbyists, and politically-appointed judges.
1.12.5.1. Con: USA has a so called [anti-SLAPP statue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation)defends the small person.
